<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Macedonian Defense Minister: `Greece </F>
Will Not Declare War on Albania -- Tensions on Macedonian-Serb 
Border'"] 
  [Text] "Greece is not planning to declare war on Albania, 
which would intensify the relations in the region to an even 
greater extent," the Macedonian Defense Minister Vlado Popovski 
told the MIC today on the occasion of the latest Albanian-Greek 
dispute and the announcement made by Greek Prime Minister 
Papandreou that his government is prepared to undertake other 
measures if the diplomatic action fails. 
  As it is known, Greece is accusing Albania of waging a new 
campaign of persecution of the Greek minority in this country, 
whose numbers are estimated at 400,000 by Athens, while the 
Albanian authorities estimate this figure at 60,000. 
  The defense minister of the Republic of Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], which borders 
with Greece and Albania, and which is following the latest 
development of events between the two neighboring countries with 
rapt interest, says: "A Greek demonstration of power can be 
expected, however, not an armed action, which would not be just 
an ordinary war. In that event, Macedonia can expect increased 
activities of the Greek military on its borders, which will add 
to the already existing tensions on the border between Macedonia 
and Greece." 
  Popovski also stated that particularly strong tensions were 
felt in the last two months between the border organs of the 
Republic of Macedonia and the FRY, which can be characterized as 
a form of military pressure. "There were nine border incidents 
in the last two months, which, according to our opinion, were on 
Macedonian territory, while the FRY border organs believe they 
took place on their territory. From our aspect, there was a 
violation of the border of up to 300 meters, and on one 
occasion, even up to 4 km inside our territory. We are 
witnesses of untypical activities in the border region which 
cannot be characterized only as refresher activities of the 
reserve contingent of this neighboring state. We also do not 
have any information as to when these activities will end, as 
they do not talk to us, and such information was also not 
received by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Commander for 
Macedonia Brigadier General Tellefsen during his recent visit to 
Nis." 
  The defense minister also said that the Macedonia border 
organs received an ultimatum from the FRY, that the Macedonian 
border watchtower Gasince was on Serbian territory. In 
addition, the observation post 40 of the UNPROFOR Nordic 
Battalion on the Macedonian-Serb border was issued a warning by 
the Yugoslav army on May 24 to leave this place within two weeks. 
  "This way a mechanism is created, which raises tensions that 
can lead to an incident, and later on even to an escalation, 
which can be used as a scenario for maintaining high tensions. 
There are still no announcements by Serbia and Greece of an 
intention to recognize the statehood of the Republic of 
Macedonia," Popovski says. "This only stimulates the extremisms 
in both neighboring countries. The state border between the two 
countries is called "administrative" by the military organs of 
the FRY, as if it was not a border between two countries. The 
Macedonian-Serbian border, according to the Constitution of the 
former SFRY, is a state border between two republics.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbs Will Take Part in Census, </F>
Perhaps Not in Elections"] 
  [Text] At a press conference, the Democratic Association 
of Serbs stated the Serbs in Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia] are ready to cooperate in realization of the 
coming census and will take part in it. The Association 
President Boro Ristic pointed out the census is a test for the 
democracy and statehood of Macedonia. He appealed to all Serbs 
in Macedonia to declare themselves Serbs, and not Yugoslavs. 
  As for the elections laws, the Association suggests the 
parliament should consist of 120 deputies elected on a majority 
principle, 15 on a proportional one, and five deputies, to be 
appointed by the Ethnic Council. "Unless the parliament accepts 
this proposal or comes up with an adequate coalition partner to 
protect the rights of Serbs in Macedonia, the Association will 
boycott the elections in November," Ristic stated.

protest against the structure of the State Census Committee, 
appointed by the government. The Turk member of the Committee 
has been appointed without consulting the party, which is for

conducted in a manner same as all previous censuses, i.e., it 
will be partial and doubtful. If this party is neglected in the

  [Text] Tirana, May 30 (ATA) -- Commenting on the storm of 
threats, slanders and offenses towards Albania and Albanian 
authorities as well as the war mongering calls of the most 
senior authorities of Greece over the last weekend, the 
spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said that all these aim at 
stirring up tensions and artificially preventing the dialogue. 
Referring to numerous threats by the Greek officials, the 
spokesman stressed that the Albanians and Albania, as the most 
ancient nation of the Balkans, do not threaten anyone, but they 
also consider hopeless those who try to impress the Albanians 
through threats. The policy of threats towards the Albanians is 
an abortive policy. Regarding the numerous offenses by senior 
Greek officials for Albanian authorities and Albania, the 
spokesman said that he did not want to answer because he said 
they reminded him of the Hoxha period when the dictator used to 
slander and offend all the leadership of Europe. 
  Certainly, he said, "I consider them as an expression of the 
crisis of the political culture. I can see that object of their 
attacks have also been other European countries during the past 
few months." 
  Further on the spokesman said that what should be considered 
true and dangerous are the warmongering calls of the Greek 
senior political leadership and the evocation on their part of 
another Bosnia in the south of the Balkans. 
  "I think that Greek statements should be analyzed through a 
special preoccupation by the European Union, the USA, Russia and 
the UN. They are a clear sign showing that those who are 
dreaming of another Bosnia are seriously attacked by the Serbian 
syndrome. This clearly helps to interpret and understand more 
clearly and convincingly the greek regional policy for the past 
two years. I remind these messrs", the spokesman said further 
on, "that the game of Bosnia in the south of the Balkans means a 
broader Balkan conflict for which they will be fully responsible.

  [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- The president's press and 
information office reports that, commenting on the latest 
developments in the relations with Greece, President Berisha 
stated that: 
  There has been no reason to suspend the meeting of the two 
foreign ministers. Albania holds that not interruption but 
continuation of the dialogue helps overcome the difficulties in 
the Greek-Albanian relations and the lowering of tension. I 
would like to stress that the detention of six Greek minority 
people under charges which are already known took place several 
weeks before we agreed on the meeting. No other arrests have 
been made regarding the above process, but Albanian citizens of 
Greek origin and Albanians have been interrogated as witnesses 
according to penal procedure. This is a right of the Albanian 
independent justice for which it has to ask permission from 
nobody. The judicial process will be normal, open and 
independent. 
  During this period Greece has blocked the EU assistance for 
the balance of payments of Albania. With this act they aim not 
only at discouraging the reforms but also to change the radical 
European direction and orientation of Albania. On this 
occasion, I would like to declare and confirm that neither this 
blockade of the assistance for the balance of payments nor other 
measures or decisions of Greece towards Albania will succeed to 
divert Albania's European direction and its integration into 
Europe. I am confident in the EU Commission and the European 
Union member countries and governments that they have their own 
positive independent opinion for the Albanian policy as a factor 
for the stability in the region and for the efforts of Albania 
to expand cooperation in the region according to the interests 
of the EU. I also am aware that they will not accept to prevent 
reforms in Albania, because this union, its member countries and 
international institutions have been those that have encouraged 
and supported Albania mostly. I agree with the call of Greece 
to the EU member countries to deal with the problems created in 
the Albanian-Greek relations. Albania is ready and open to 
cooperate with them and also welcomes their contribution to the 
re-establishment of the Albanian-Greek dialogue, unilaterally 
interrupted by the Greek party. 
  Lastly, regarding the fuss of the Greek propaganda on the 
lack of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania, I would 
like to say once more that Albania is fully determined to create 
a pattern of the treatment of minorities in the region and that 
the Greek minority enjoys all the rights and freedoms envisaged 
by the charter of Copenhagen. International institutions, the 
CSCE, European parliament, the US congress know and have 
reconfirmed several times these uncontested facts. On this 
occasion I would like to tell Mr. Papandreuo that despite his 
abusive statements, which is not the first time, and which have 
been inspired by electoral interests or long-term goals, 
Albania's policy towards the Greek minority will not change. It 
is dictated by our determination to establish the rule of law 
and the market economy in Albania. It cannot be dictated by 
other tendencies to manipulate the minority. By offering 
dialogue and insisting in it, Albania will never accept that the 
questions of the minority be manipulated and put at the disposal 
of nationalistic or electoral fevers.

  [Text] Tirana, May 27 (ATA) -- [passage indistinct] as an 
independent country, whether to the liking of Greece or not, is 
determined to work intensively to develop friendship and 
cooperation relying on the principle of reciprocity with all the 
countries of the region, Europe and the world which share the 
same values. Albania is convinced that this is in its own 
interest, as well as in the interest of the Balkans and of 
Greece itself. But, one should say that other analysts think 
that making a global evaluation of the Greek policy in the 
region, the relations with Albania are only a segment of the 
policy of the Greek phobia towards neighbors or better it is the 
neighbour-phobia which dominates the Greek politics today. For 
this very reason, its neighbours in the region which expected by 
the Presidency of the European Union, that as states are 
directly bordered with the European Union to be assisted by 
Greece in order to be closer to this union and its 
opportunities, received the opposite of the assistance. 
  Thus, Greece established embargo against The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], while on the other way it blocked 
the EU assistance for Albania's salaries' fund. Wherefore 
Greece chose embargoes, blockades, grudges, and damnation to 
"contribute" to the stability of Balkans for the first six 
months of the 1994. Italy, NATO, and EU member, too, could not 
escape from the Greek anathema. It was the same way with 
Turkey, NATO member. Only Serbia has profited by the Greek 
Presidency in the region and may be the heavens and the seas 
which surround Greece until the Gods of Greece get angry with 
them.

  [Text] Sofia, May 28 (BTA) -- Indian President Shankar 
Dayal Sharma ended his state visit here which began on May 26. 
Dr. Sharma departed for Varna on the Black Sea. On Monday [30 
May] he leaves for Romania. 
  The talks between the presidents of Bulgaria and India and 
the Bulgarian and Indian delegations took place in a friendly 
atmosphere, typical of the traditionally warm relations between 
the two countries, says a release for the press on the state 
visit. The sides share the view the democratic changes in 
Bulgaria and the economic reforms in India help promote the 
traditionally friendly relations and economic cooperation. 
  The release says Bulgaria and India are willing to promote 
bilateral cooperation in the economy, trade, industry, science, 
technology, etc., on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. 
They stressed the need to expand cooperation in environmental 
protection and efficient natural resouces use, and to coordinate 
efforts in combatting organized crime, international terrorism 
and illicit trafficking in drugs and cultural and historical 
valuables. The sides signed six documents. 
  The sides discussed international issues of mutual concern, 
says the release. It says, beside rising poverty, the world 
faces new challenges and threats, calling for urgent and 
creative solutions. 
  The sides expressed satisfaction with the talks and stressed 
the need for regular contacts on various levels and among 
different institutions. They are convinced the promotion of 
relations between Bulgaria and India is in the interest of both

break. 
  The Indian business people accompanying the president will

Indian scholars. I am glad many Bulgarians know the languages 
and culture of India, he told students and professors of the 
Eastern Languages and Cultures Centre with Sofia University and 
members of the Friends of India Club. He said the spiritual 
ties between Bulgaria and India provide a good basis for the 
promotion of cooperation in all fields.

  [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- The 19th Bulgarian-Korean 
(DPRK) Commission for Economic and Technological Cooperation 
ended here today with the signing of a protocol on the results 
of the session and of an agreement for drafting treaties on 
avoiding double taxation and reciprocal investment protection 
and promotion. The two sides observed that the resumption of 
the work of the commission (the 18th Bulgarian-Korean commission 
was held in 1989), will improve bilateral trade and economic 
relations and sci-technical cooperation, the chairmen of the two 
sides of the commission -- Bulgarian Deputy Trade Minister Kiril 
Velev and the deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations 
Committee of the DPRK Ku Bo Te [spelling of name as received] -- 
told a press conference. 
  An agreement was reached to cover Bulgaria's 
4-million-transferable-ruble surplus in bilateral commercial 
exchange by the end of 1995 with the import of raw materials and 
consumer goods, Mr. Velev said. Mr. Te said that the Government 
of the DPRK gives priority to foreign trade and to promoting and 
developing trade and economic relations with Bulgaria. 
  Ms. Antoaneta Dincheva, expert at the "Countries in 
Transition" Department at the Ministry of Trade, told BTA that 
Bulgaria and the DPRK effected their payments in convertible 
currency at the current international prices on the main 
commodity exchanges. In June 1993 the two countries signed an 
Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation in order to wind up 
reciprocal payments in transferable rubles and granted each 
other most-favoured-nation status. The DPRK is interested in 
the export of raw materials for the Bulgarian silk industry, in 
the import of machines and equipment for the light and food 
processing industries, in cooperation in the production of 
electric and I.C.E. [internal-combustion-engined] lift trucks, 
as well as in the setting up in the DPRK of a joint enterprise 
for the production of fireproof bricks. In the field of 
agriculture the two sides showed interest in the exchange of 
genetic material of animal and plant origin and the Bulgarian 
side showed interest in importing silkworm grain [as received]. 
  According to data of the Ministry of Trade, in 1993 
bilateral 
commercial exchange amounted to U.S.$6,343,100, which is 
approximately 65 percent up from 1992 (U.S.$3,856,000). In 1991 
this figure was U.S.$2,201,000. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK 
totalled U.S.$4,282,100 and imports from the DPRK 
U.S.$2,061,000. Last year the DPRK remained second among 
Bulgaria's partners of the former socialist countries in Asia, 
following China. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK comprise mainly 
base metals, textile materials, machines and equipment, 
transport devices, mineral and chemical products, and the 
structure of Bulgarian imports from the DPRK is dominated by 
textile raw materials, foodstuffs, cement products, plaster, 
ceramics, glass, instruments, etc. In the first three months of 
1994 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and the DPRK exceeded 
U.S.$1,018,800. 
  The delegation of the DPRK had meetings at the Ministry of 
Industry, the Agricultural Academy and with Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev. The next 
joint Bulgarian-Korean commission is scheduled to be held in 
1995 in Pyongyang.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 26 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav 
Havel believes the Slovak Government has the opportunity to 
bring Czech-Slovak relations up to a comfortable level, Slovak 
Premier Jozef Moravcik told journalists today after meeting 
Havel. 
  Havel and Moravcik have reviewed foreign policy questions, 
Moravcik said, adding he then told Havel that the old trading 
account with the Czech Republic (from before the currency split 
in March 1993) was causing Slovakia problems. 
  "Kasarna, the contested village of recreation cottages owned 
by Czechs, was only briefly mentioned," Moravcik said, adding 
that it is an open question and likely to remain one for some 
time. 
  The Czech-Slovak border commission suggested, on the basis 
of 
prevailing local opinion, that Kasarna be included in the Czech 
Republic in return for a similar area elsewhere along the 
border. The only road to Kasarna leads from the Czech Republic. 
Slovakia wants to keep Kasarna. 
  Moravcik said there was "not yet any reason" for a meeting 
with his Czech counterpart Vaclav Klaus. A meeting of premiers 
has been thought necessary for the settling of the Kasarna 
issue. The two countries would gradually deal with the open 
issues, which are mainly "technical," Moravcik said he told 
Havel. Some of them can be resolved before the elections, 
others afterwards, Moravcik said. 
  Havel last met Slovak Premier in March 1993 during what was 
his first trip abroad as President of the Czech Republic. 
Vladimir Meciar then held the post.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jozo Curic from Geneva] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Bosnian Croats were again the first to agree 
to come to Geneva. Kresimir Zubak, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and Mile Akmadzic, foreign 
minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, arrived in 
Geneva a few minutes ago. They were invited by Yasushi Akashi. 
There is no indication whether Federation Vice President Ejup 
Ganic, who represents the Bosnian Muslims at the cease-fire 
negotiations, will come. 
  Bearing in mind that all three sides have been invited to 
Geneva, it is not likely that Kresimir Zubak will be negotiating 
on behalf of the Federation, that is, of the two sides. Let us 
note that these talks today are not the negotiations on a 
general political solution to Bosnia-Herzegovina that are 
expected to resume in Geneva this coming weekend. This is the 
United Nation's attempt to mediate in a cease-fire between the 
Serbs and the Muslims, to make Mladic and Delic sign an 
agreement to disengage their forces. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, June 2 (AFP) -- The Moslem-led Bosnian 
Government refused to attend a new round of peace talks set to 
begin Thursday after Bosnian Serbs failed to honor pledges to 
withdraw their forces from the town of Gorazde, diplomats said. 
The Bosnian Presidency said Thursday that it would not send any 
representatives to the meeting "for the moment" but could 
"eventually" attend talks on Friday, the diplomats said. 
  The government had demanded that the Serbs withdraw all 
armed 
men from around the eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde before the 
talks went ahead. But earlier Thursday a UN Protection Force 
(UNPROFOR) spokesman in Sarajevo said that contrary to a written 
pledge by Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, some 150 armed 
Serb policemen were still inside a UN-imposed three-kilometre 
(two-mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde. "Nothing has changed 
in Gorazde," regarding the Serb forces withdrawal, UNPROFOR 
spokesman Major Rob Annink said. 
  The withdrawal of the 150 Serbs from the exclusion zone on 
the east bank of the River Drina had been the main condition of 
the Bosnian Government of President Alija Izetbegovic for 
attending the peace talks. 
  Under threat of NATO air strikes, Bosnian Serbs ended a 
weeks-long offensive against Gorazde earlier this year and 
pulled their heavy weapons back from the exclusion zone, but 
refused to withdraw the policemen from what they said was a 
Serb-inhabited section of the town. Karadzic, in a letter sent 
to UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi on Wednesday promised that 
"as of today there will be no armed Serb personnel" in the 
three-kilometre zone. 
  Akashi said in a statement Wednesday that Karadzic's letter 
could provide "a sufficient basis for the opening of the meeting 
in Geneva" but the talks "could not take place unless all 
Bosnian Serb soliders, militia and armed civilians were 
redeployed outside the zone." 
  Akashi was expected here from Zagreb later Thursday to chair 
the talks, which were also to be attended by mediators Thorvald 
Stoltenberg of the United Nations and Lord Owen of the European 
Union and the special U.S. and Russian envoys Charles Redman and 
Vitaliy Churkin. The Serbs were to be represented by Karadzic 
and Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic. 
  Diplomatic sources said the international community and the 
United Nations have been applying strong pressure on the 
belligerents to return to the negotiating table with hopes of 
reaching tangible results, first on a ceasefire and then on an 
administrative division of Bosnia along ethnic lines, within 
eight weeks. But a Croatian diplomat said Wednesday that it 
might not be in the best interests of the newly formed 
Moslem-Croat federation "to settle for a comprehensive cessation 
of hostilities." 
  "Previous agreements have all been violated by the Serbs," 
the diplomat said. "A new one, if implemented, would freeze the 
military situation on the ground, thus benefitting the Serbs." 
He said the belligerents would then be forced to deal with a 
contact group trying to settle the conflict at all costs, "even 
if it rewards Serb aggression." 
  The contact group -- the European Union, Russia and the 
United States -- tried in vain last week to get the warring 
factions to agree to a four-month truce and to accept a plan 
that would give 51 percent of territory to the Moslem-Croat 
federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. The Croats and Moslems 
are demanding 58 percent of the territory. The Serbs currently 
control about 70 percent. 
  A French Foreign Ministry spokesman meanwhile said in Paris 
that representatives of the contact group would meet again with 
the warring Bosnian parties Saturday and Sunday in Geneva. The 
meeting had been scheduled for next week but was moved up for 
"practical reasons" related to Thursday and Friday's planned 
Geneva discussions, spokesman Richard Duque said.

  [Text] Geneva, June 2 (AFP) -- The United Nations on 
Thursday ruled out peace negotiations on Bosnia as long as Serb 
forces remained in the eastern Bosnian enclave of Gorazde. UN 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi said "the Serbs must withdraw and 
until they do the talks will not proceed." But he added that 
the talks on a cessation of hostilities with the warring

three-kilometre (two mile) exclusion zone around Gorazde. 
  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic insisted in an

many there. They left last night," he said.

  [Text] On Pakistan's initiative, a meeting of the contact 
group of the Islamic Conference Organization is going to be held 
in Cairo today to discuss the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Our delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, 
who is attending the (?conference) as a guest, was informed of 
this by the Pakistani representatives. 
  During the talk with Minister Ljubijankic, the Pakistani 
foreign minister also promised firm support to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina when the declaration of the Cairo conference 
on the Nonaligned Movement is drafted. Pakistan will contribute 
to the discussion on lifting the embargo on arms imports into 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  During the discussions on bilateral relations, the two 
ministers discussed the appointment of a Pakistani ambassador to 
Sarajevo. The government in Islamabad also promised help in 
establishing relations and cooperation with other countries, 
particularly China and Japan. 
  Ljubijankic also had a brief meeting with the Chinese 
ambassador in Cairo, who is heading the official Chinese 
delegation at the conference. They discussed possibilities of 
furthering relations and the mutual recognition of the two 
countries. 
  Already on the first day of the Cairo conference, Minister 
Ljubijankic talked with Arab League Secretary General Ismat 
'Abd-al-Majid. Full support was expressed for the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and one expression of such an attitude was 
the refusal to allow Serbia and Montenegro to participate in the 
nonaligned countries conference. Minister Ljubijankic also had 
other meetings with many world dignitaries who attended the 11th 
Ministerial Conference of the Nonaligned Movement.

  [Text] India and Romania have signed agreements on 
cooperation in combating terrorism and for promotion of cultural 
exchanges and tourism. The agreements was signed at the end of 
the four-day state visit of the president, Dr. Shankar Dayal 
Sharma, to Bucharest. 
  The home minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, signed the agreement on 
combatting international terrorism, organized crime, and illicit 
trafficking in narcotic drugs. It is to be implemented by home 
ministries of the two countries. The agreement on tourism 
envisages a joint campaign to promote tourism and exchange of 
information and personnel. The cultural exchange programs cover 
exchange of dancers, musicians, theater groups, academicians, 
and scientists. Our special correspondent, Ram Behari 
Vishwakarma, reports from Bucharest that the two countries have 
also signed a declaration of principles and directions of 
cooperation under which they pledge to interact with each other 
in various fields for mutual benefit. 
  The president has since left Bucharest for home at the end 
of 
his state visit to Romania. Before his departure, Dr. Sharma 
expressed great satisfaction over his visit, during which wide 
range of bilateral, regional, and global issues were discussed. 
He said Romania's transition to market economy and India's 
steady progress as one of the world's largest markets opens 
tremendous possibilities for cooperation between the two 
countries. The president said India-Romanian friendship and 
cooperation can make a valuable contribution to the cause of 
building a peaceful and nonviolent world. The Romanian 
president, Mr. Iliescu, has accepted an invitation from Dr. 
Sharma to pay a state visit to India.

  [Text] During a news conference by the National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] today, the leadership of that 
party termed the proposal made by the PL-93 [Liberal Party-1993] 
on converting the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] into a 
single political party as, quote, a game and a diversion. The 
melting of all the groupings belonging to the CDR into a unique 
party may actually be interpreted as the efforts of certain 
people with dictatorial tendencies, unquote, [PNCTD Chairman] 
Corneliu Coposu emphasized, adding that the unification of 
parties is made on the basis of the fusion of their interests 
rather than on the basis of decrees. 
  Furthermore, Coposu remarked that the PL-93 proposal may 
also 
be interpreted as an attempt by that party to divert attention 
from the need to reestablish the unity of the liberal movement. 
  Answering a question related to a statement he had made in 
Paris in connection with the form of government in Romania, the 
PNTCD chairman confirmed that he had made a statement 
emphasizing that, in his opinion, at present the solution for 
salvaging Romania would be the restoration of the monarchic 
principle. We consider that King Mihai is the sole personality 
having the vocation able to concentrate the sympathy and the 
aspirations of the Romanian people, Coposu said, also mentioning 
that despite the fact that the PNTCD did not vote in favor of 
the Constitution, it will observe its stipulations as long as it 
is valid. However, this does not exclude the PNTCD's intent to 
alter it if it wins the majority in parliament, the PNTCD 
chairman added. 
  Talking about other issues, Coposu commented on the 
adherence 
of the Romanian Mining Trade Union Confederation to the 
principles of Christian democracy, expressing his hope that 
future visits by the miners to PNTCD headquarters will be in 
accordance with those principles. 
  Regarding the program for public investments that was 
discussed during the 28 May cabinet meeting, Senator Radu Vasile 
stressed that the PNTCD will support this idea of furthering 
economic revival, provided that the investments in question are 
earmarked for works of national interests, our correspondent 
Elena Perdichi reports.

<F P=106> [Interview with Csaba Tabajdi, Hungarian Socialist Party </F>
expert on national and ethnic minority affairs, by Istvan Joo; 
place and date not given: "Csaba Tabajdi on Hungarians Abroad"] 
  [Text] It is a known fact that a significant number of the 
Hungarians living beyond the border are concerned about the 
election results and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] that 
is preparing for power. Mostly, Hungarian minority leaders 
living abroad are worried that the cabinet led by the Socialists 
will make basic treaties with the neighboring countries before 
the interests of the Hungarians living there receive adequate 
guarantees. Recently, Miklos Duray [chairman of the Coexistence 
Movement in Slovakia] expressed his worries. We interviewed 
Csaba Tabajdi on the obviously not unfounded fears. 
  [Tabajdi] If Miklos Duray had read the MSZP's program that I 
personally handed over to him in Bratislava in January, then I 
do not really understand what he is afraid of. According to the 
program, basic treaties can be written in such a way that they 
lay down the inviolability of borders, and guarantee the rights 
of the national minorities. The material also contains [a 
provision] that before a basic treaty is signed, it must be 
coordinated with the opposition parties and the democratic 
organizations of Hungarians abroad. 
  [Joo] Would the latter [organizations] be present during 
intergovernmental negotiations? 
  [Tabajdi] This would also be possible if the negotiating 
partners do not have objections to it. 
  [Joo] Would the passage on the inviolability of borders lead 
to documents similar to the Ukrainian-Hungarian basic treaty? 
  [Tabajdi] The two countries that sign the treaty would state 
that they will not make territorial demands against each other. 
In my view, this or similar wording of the clause on borders 
should be in the treaties, as I have already said in the 
parliamentary debate on ratifying the basic treaty with Ukraine. 
This can clearly express the political intention and will of 
the treaty countries, the importance of which has been expressed 
by a number of our neighbors. Although, there are no tangible 
signs whatsoever that political forces that are significant in 
Hungarian politics would question the reality of borders. 
However, many decades ago, an atmosphere of mistrust emerged in 
this region; a properly worded, modern, basic treaty would be an 
answer to this. 
  [Joo] Anyway, during the campaign, there was a difference 
between the statements made by you, who had drawn up the 
program, and the statements of MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn. Horn 
would abolish the Office for Hungarians Living Abroad [HTMH]. 
  [Tabajdi] The work of the HTMH was also sharply criticized 
in the program. We stated that the Office has to be 
fundamentally reorganized. The future of the HTMH is uncertain 
at the moment, because it depends on the future governmental 
structure as a whole. However, this does not mean that the MSZP 
does not consider care for the Hungarians living abroad to be 
important, but it wishes to implement this in a different 
institutional and organizational structure. 
  [Joo] Is it true that the Socialists are planning to set up 
a ministry on national minorities under your leadership? And 
the HTMH would be incorporated in this just as the government 
office dealing with church affairs? 
  [Tabajdi] It would be too early to talk about the 
organization at the moment. As for my future office, this is 
only speculation.

<F P=106> ["Gy.Z"-signed interview with Istvan Gyarmati, head of the </F>
Security Policy and European Cooperation Department of the 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry; place and date not given: "Anyone 
Who Expects a Quick Solution Will Be Greatly Disappointed"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Since its 
presentation, the Balladur plan has gone through considerable 
changes, and not always changes favorable for us. To what 
extent are Hungarian interests represented in the Paris document 
that has only started its process but has not yet finished? 
  [Gyarmati] Of course, the Balladur plan has changed, 
compared with its original form. This is natural, because one 
thing is absolutely certain in diplomacy: Whatever one suggests 
at the beginning, will definitely not be the final result of the 
negotiations. It is a fact that some things were omitted from 
the original proposal, some things that Hungarian diplomacy and 
the Hungarian public would have welcomed in the proposal, like 
the need to guarantee the collective rights of national 
minorities. It is also true, however, that a few elements 
favorable for us have been included in the document in the 
meantime, like the one that the European Union will also support 
financially the implementation of certain projects, like border 
crossing points and national minority cultural institutions. I 
think that the current version of the document meets Hungarian 
interests, because it does not want to force on us any solution 
that we decline to accept. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What minimum and maximum goals has Hungarian 
diplomacy formulated for the series of negotiations following 
the Paris document, particularly regarding the fact that the 
Hungarian position regarding an adequate settling of the 
minority issue does not meet with the approach of either our 
regional partners or our Western partners? 
  [Gyarmati] Our position regarding the borders is unchanged: 
There are no open border issues for Hungary. Our neighbors are 
also aware of this; nor do they claim that there is such an 
issue. At the same time, they think the present borders should 
once again be confirmed in a basic treaty. We always said we 
would find an adequate form for this, but we do not commit 
ourselves to what this form should be because, in the course of 
negotiations, one never commits himself to a single form. 
Therefore, the border issue has never been a real problem for 
Hungary; it is still not a problem for us. At the same time, we 
do see problems regarding national minorities. This is a mirror 
reflection of the border issue, because our neighbors claim that 
there is no national minority issue, while we say that there is 
such an issue. 
  The Paris document says that the accepted UN, CSCE, and 
Council of Europe documents represent the basis of the national 
minority issue. This means that one cannot go below the already 
accepted international norms. At the same time, it does not 
mean that one cannot exceed these norms. Obviously, we want to 
exceed them at the negotiations, while our partners do not want 
to exceed them. If it is true that the starting position of 
neither side will be the final solution, the final result will 
lie somewhere between the currently accepted standards and our 
maximum goals, and this can only be a better solution than the 
current one. Therefore, I think that there can be clearly 
positive developments here. 
  There can only be one issue in which we have serious 
difficulties. We say that it is not nice to discuss minorities 
without consulting these minorities. We think it is necessary 
for these national minorities to be able to say what is the 
problem and the recipe in their view, and to comment on whether 
or not the emerging solution is acceptable for them. Who else 
could tell how many school classes are needed in the areas 
inhabited by national minorities? I think we can achieve a 
solution in Paris that leaves the issue and the possibilities 
open, so that we can return to them at concrete negotiations.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Exit Poll Ever in Hungary"] </F>
  [Text] For the first time in the history of Hungarian 
elections, three polling agencies came forward with the 
projected result of the elections practically the moment the 
polls closed. The exit polls, the legality of which had earlier 
been questioned by the interior minister, indicate a great 
advance by the opposition parties, and among them especially by 
the Socialists. 
  The Median polling agency conducted its survey together with 
NEPSZABADSAG. Their preliminary plans were to conduct a survey 
in 704 districts, but as a result of last week's antipolling 
campaign, pollsters were turned away from several localities by 
the authorities. According to Median, it is conceivable that 
because of the campaign there were more people than usual among 
right-wing voters who refused to answer, and therefore they 
might have somewhat underestimated the percentage of 
national-conservative voters. Incidentally, the pollsters of 
Szonda Ipsos who prepared their survey for MAGYAR HIRLAP had 
similar experiences. 
  Median's survey, prepared on the basis of a national sample, 
was completed a few minutes after the polls officially closed. 
According to the survey, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
received 33 percent of the votes for party tickets. The 
Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] followed with 19 percent, 
while third place, with 11 percent, went to the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF]. The Independent Smallholders Party 
[FKGP] got 10 percent, and the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] got 
7 percent each. According to the preliminary survey, three 
representatives were elected in the first round: Gabor Kuncze 
[SZDSZ] in Pest county, Tamas Suchman [MSZP] in Somogy county, 
and Agnes Gyarfas Rado, also a Socialist, in 
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county. 
  The Szonda Ipsos agency also conducted a national survey. 
Their ranking: 27 percent for the MSZP, 20 percent for the 
SZDSZ, 12 percent each for the MDF and Fidesz, 10 percent for 
the FKGP, and 8 percent for the KDNP. According to Szonda's 
data, of the 32 Budapest election districts, Socialist 
candidates were in the lead in 25 and Free Democrats in seven. 
Nationally, 104 MSZP candidates and 40 Free Democrats are in 
first place in the election districts for individual 
representatives. 
  The Hungarian Gallup Institute, whose pollsters questioned 
134,733 voters, arrived basically at similar results. According 
to the afternoon survey of the Gallup Institute, the MSZP led 
with 31 percent. The Socialists were followed by the SZDSZ with 
20 percent, the MDF with 10 percent, the Fidesz and the FKGP 
with 9 percent each, and the KDNP with 7 percent. 
  All three exit polls indicate that no new party will have 
seats in the Hungarian National Assembly.

  [Text] This morning Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik met 
editors in chief of Slovak newspapers and directors of the 
electronic media. Under discussion were current political 
problems, on which the prime minister replied to numerous 
questions from representatives of the press. After the meeting, 
reporter Lydia Mrazova asked Jozef Moravcik for an interview. 
  [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Today is 77 days since you 
became 
prime minister in this government, and during this short time -- 
you could describe it as such -- the opposition has tried to 
dismiss Roman Kovac and Minister Janicina. Do you think will 
there yet be another? 
  [Moravcik] The tactics of the present opposition suggest 
that 
it will probably not stop playing this game, this destructive 
game, and that it will try to continue with it. I do not have 
any concrete information about who it might be. 
  [Mrazova] And what about fears? 
  [Moravcik] No fears, because until now the means of 
presentation tended to harm those presenting proposals for 
dismissal. 
  [Mrazova] According to what you said, although the coalition 
was formed with partners of differing orientations, the 
coalition is functioning well. During the vote of confidence 
vote in the minister for the administration and privatization it 
transpired that even deputies from the coalition parties 
contributed several votes in favor if his dismissal. Some 
expressed the view in the lobby that although they will not be 
voting for his dismissal they consider him to be the weakest 
point in the government. I do not expect you to criticize your 
minister, but how would you characterize this post? 
  [Moravcik] I have already said many times that privatization 
is a meeting point for a large number of conflicting interests 
and various organizations which exert various kinds of 
influence. What we call lobbies today are very strong. A 
minister in this position has to have a very firm character and 
also sound nerves because to manage all that, to resist all the 
pressures, and to organize and carry out privatization in such a 
way that it supports the government's policy is very demanding. 
It really is a very demanding position and I am satisfied with 
how the work is being carried out. So far, we have managed to 
overcome all the differences that have appeared, the different 
views that have appeared, which are entirely natural. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and 
date not given: "The Law on Registers Could Serve as an Example 
for Other States"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary deputies yesterday passed one of the 
laws that the Slovak Republic pledged to adopt on its admission 
into the Council of Europe -- the law on [birth, marriage, and 
death] registers. We asked Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement Chairman Vojtech Bugar for his opinion on the law. 
  [Pankovcinova] Some Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] and Slovak National Party [SNS] deputies labelled the law 
"anti-Slovak" and walked out of parliament as a sign of protest. 
Could you explain the gist of this law? 
  [Bugar] They labelled as anti-Slovak articles 15 and 18, 
which state that, if someone wishes to have his first name 
entered in his mother tongue, the first change of the name in 
the register is free. Likewise, if a woman wants to have her 
surname entered in her documents in the mother tongue, without 
the suffix -ova [characterizing female surnames in Slovak], this 
law allows her to do so free of charge the first time. An 
amendment specifying the usage of the first name and the surname 
also passed in parliament. This means that the first name and 
the surname in the mother tongue (that is, without the suffix 
-ova) will be used in the spoken and written Slovak language 
with the ending -ova and will be inflected according to Slovak 
grammar rules. Therefore, it is absolutely okay when a Slovak 
speaker will refer to my wife as Mrs. Bugarova. She will only 
have the chance to have her surname entered in her identity 
papers as Bugar. 
  [Pankovcinova] Are you satisfied with the adopted law? 
  [Bugar] Yes. Parliament adopted a very liberal law and 
complied with the recommendation of the Council of Europe. The 
present and future governments will be able to appear at 
international forums with dignity because this law could serve 
as an example also for other states in which there are ethnic 
minorities.

  [Text] An Indian army delegation led by Defense Minister 
Mallikarjun arrived in Slovakia today on a three-day official 
visit. Here is our colleague Miroslav Milar with more 
information on the visit of the Indian guests. 
  [Milar] The official welcoming ceremony took place at the 
Defense Ministry shortly after 1500. Slovak Defense Minister 
Pavol Kanis welcomed his Indian counterpart. Shortly 
afterwards, the Indian army delegation took part in the first 
round of talks with the representatives of the Slovak Defense 
Ministry and military command. Pavol Kanis briefed journalists 
about the agenda of the talks. 
  [Begin Kanis recording] Our negotiations focused mainly on 
the possibilities of cooperation in armaments production and on 
contracts relating to the sale of Slovak arms and armaments 
systems to India. It must be said that the Slovak Republic is 
continuing in the tradition of all the positive contacts we have 
had in the past, i.e., the contacts between the former 
Czechoslovakia and India. The Indian Defense Ministry and 
representatives of the Indian Army are seriously interested in 
contracts with Slovak armaments producers. We exchanged views on 
some areas in which India might be interested, for example spare 
parts and other products, but definitive steps will be taken in 
the next few days. [end recording] 
  [Milar] After the talks at the Defense Ministry, Indian 
Defense Minister Mallikarjun was received by Slovak President 
Michal Kovac and afterwards by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovak National Bank Renewed Refinancing"] </F>
  [Text] In the 22d week, after a period of approximately 
three months, the Slovak National Bank [NBS] again started to 
refinance commercial banks by means of auction credits. Even 
earlier, the NBS renewed the rediscount of exchange bills for 
agriculture. According to information from the NBS, the above 
measures can be regarded as an indication of good marcoeconomic 
results, such as, for example, the favorable development of the 
inflation rate, which reached only three percent in the first 
four months of this year.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ahmed Dogan, leader of the Movement for </F>
Rights and Freedoms, by Mehmed Hodjov; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, by what formula can the 
government survive today? 
  [Dogan] This is the first time since the DPS [Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms] assumed the mandate to form a government 
that the government has faced such an extremely tricky situation. 
  Last week, the main thing that worried us was that the BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] was doing everything possible to get 
its own representative into the government. We rejected this on 
principle, because the situation on the basis of which the 
so-called government of experts was formed at the end of 1992 is 
quite different from the present political realities. 
  In our view, the fact that the BSP has 100 deputies in 
parliament does not constitute a position in the political 
sense. This party was in power for half a century; it is 
affrontery, to say the least, for it to make claims for power 
now, when we are making a transition and want to change the very 
thing that the BSP created. 
  Professor Berov, who has very great power and has to bear 
the 
responsibility for a definite program that parliament approved, 
should not try to be a balancing force in the National Assembly 
and exert pressure on parliament. In my opinion, this is where 
his mistake lies. 
  At present we are really considering a parliamentary 
agreement between the different political forces inside and 
outside parliament. 
  [Khodzhov] This agreement is in the context of the proposal 
made by the president in his address to the nation, is it not? 
  [Dogan] First, I support the proposal the president made to 
the nation, but I would naturally like to point out that I am 
not convinced that this parliamentary agreement is possible, 
given the extremely complex situation that exists in the country 
at present. Second, if, on the basis of this agreement, 
parliament approves a government that is authorized by the 
president to act as a caretaker cabinet, this will be a new 
precedent in our Constitution. [passage omitted] 
  [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, when you were in Kurdzhali you said 
that elections will most likely be held in October. What sort 
of representation does the DPS count on having in the next 
parliament? 
  [Dogan] The DPS will have a very decent representation in 
parliament. One does not comment on the predictions, but if you 
write down what I tell you, you will see that we may even get 
more seats. A party should have untapped reserves, and we are 
working on them. Naturally, we will have a completely different 
platform, updated to take account of the social problems arising 
from unemployment and the economic program. The great 
disadvantage of our cadres is that many lightweight people have 
taken key positions. We are starting right now to select cadres 
for the next elections, on the basis of certain criteria. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Khodzhov] Mr. Dogan, do you believe that the Turks are 
united in Bulgaria? I am thinking of [ex-Chief Mufti] Nedim 
Gendzhev's DPS [Democratic Party of Justice, with the same 
initials as the Rights and Freedoms Movement] and of Mehmed 
Hodja leaving your movement. 
  [Dogan] It would be stupid for the Turks to be united. I 
would not agree to represent an organization formed on an ethnic 
basis. We do not need armed soldiers, but we do need thinking 
people with similar ideas. If Nedim Gendzhev is such clever 
fellow, why is he forming a Democratic Party of Justice instead 
of calling it the Party of Free Democrats or some other name? 
Everyone hovers around the DPS, because it is very important 
as a symbol. However, whereas earlier it was the former 
repressions that united us, what must unite us now is our 
economic interests -- this is the great change in the DPS 
program. The people will sense this transformation from now on. 
One cannot create a party only on the basis of rights and 
freedoms. The man in the street is now banging the table and 
saying: I am out of work, I have nothing to eat. Previously, we 
did not appreciate this fact, but it is already knocking and 
even hammering on our door. It seems that from now on the 
market mechanism even postulates a fragmentation of society, but 
let us not discuss this issue now.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mikhail Neykov: "Janissaries Along the </F>
Vardar"] 
  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
is a strange politician. As the leader of a newly established 
state, he does not miss the opportunity to stress his adherence 
to peace and security in the Balkans and Europe. He also did 
this during his visit to Sofia. Simultaneously, he stubbornly 
and selflessly defends opinions that overtly contradict the 
principles of goodneighborliness and affect vitally important 
interests of Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. For example, how is 
it possible to declare a willingness to develop constructive 
cooperation with Greece and, at the same time, to infringe upon 
its cultural monuments? Is it impossible to speak about a 
fruitful dialogue with Tirana, while the rights of the Albanian 
minority in Macedonia, which is about 30 percent of the 
country's total population, are restricted in all possible ways? 
  What could we say about the attitude of the government in 
Skopje toward our country? It is well-known that it tries in 
all possible ways to obtain recognition of the "Macedonian 
nation," conceived by the Comintern, and of the "literary 
language" concocted by the eminent academician Blaze Koneski. 
Recently, President Gligorov prompted a scandal in Sofia by 
demanding signature of the previously prepared interstate 
agreements in Bulgarian and "Macedonian." Is this a real 
striving toward goodneighborliness and developing broad 
cooperation? He preferred to foil the signing of the documents 
in order to utilize an opportunity to insult us. Naturally, his 
trick failed. What remained was the bitter taste of the 
behavior of the former graduate of Sofia's Kliment Okhridski 
University, who got so carried away he forgot that he speaks and 
understands Bulgarian. 
  However, an evil seldom comes alone. In his speech at the 
opening of the Skopje International Fair, the same Kiro Gligorov 
dared to infringe upon the holiest of the holy -- the cause of 
the holy brothers St. Cyril and St. Methodius, and their first 
pupil -- St. Clement. Well, we Bulgarians really are a nation, 
and we are used to our lands being stolen. We will also survive 
the attempts of some people in Skopje to usurp our historical 
and cultural past. 
  The truth cannot be amended or forged. Regardless of the 
pathetic attempts of pseudohistorians along the Vardar River, 
they cannot convince anyone that King Samuil, for example, was 
not a Bulgarian king, because his great enemy, the emperor of 
Byzantium, was called Basil II -- "the Slayer of the Bulgars." 
The same circles, and indeed Kiro Gligorov himself, cannot 
convince the world that "Macedonia is the land on which the 
Slavonic alphabet was created by the Thessaloniki brothers," 
because at the time of those brothers, there were only two 
states in the Balkans -- Bulgaria and Byzantium. There simply 
was no Macedonia. 
  Thus, if someone in Skopje is interested in 
goodneighborliness, then he should reassess his behavior. We 
can live without a few thousand Janissaries, who deny their kin 
and mother. However, they cannot live alone.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "Benes Decrees Were the 
Reality of the Time"] 
  [Excerpts] In a regular interview with the prime minister, 
we discuss the topical events of the past week. [passage omitted] 
  [Krejci] The Czech Republic has a deficit on the clearing 
account with Slovakia. What do you see as the reason for this 
happening? 
  [Klaus] There are many reasons. First, the partition of 
Czechoslovakia disrupted various cooperative ties that 
ordinarily exist within a single economy. 
  Another factor is the fact that the Slovak koruna devalued 
in 
relation to the clearing ECU. Moreover, the import surcharge 
was introduced. These three moments combined represent an 
increase in the price of Czech imports to Slovakia and, vice 
versa, a reduction in Slovak exports to the Czech Republic. 
That, of course, leads to an increase in the flow of goods from 
Slovakia to the Czech Republic rather than vice versa. 
  The third important factor is that imports to any country 
are 
a function of the development of the gross domestic product of 
that country. The correlation between the two quantities is 
obvious according to direct proportionality: The richer the 
country is, the more it buys. The reciprocal is also valid -- 
the poorer the country is, the less it buys. That is the third 
reason leading to the demand for Slovak, and foreign goods in 
general, being higher in the Czech Republic than vice versa. 
  The fourth reason is a certain conscious decision, on the 
Slovak part, of the type: "We have a deficit, something must be 
done about it." That gives rise to a certain psychological 
atmosphere that leads some Slovak firms to simply not shop on 
the Czech market. 
  Only fifth is the issue of administrative problems and the 
renowned certificates. There is not such a genius who could 
weigh the effect of all these factors precisely. Only a few of 
them can be directly affected by the Czech Republic. 
  [Krejci] Can or will the Czech side undertake something? 
  [Klaus] We are not likely to introduce any artificial import 
barriers. Nor can we create in Slovakia a greater demand for 
Czech goods. At most, we could do something about the exchange 
rate of the koruna within the framework of the clearing account. 
These are very minor measures, however, with a long-term rather 
than an immediate effect. 
  A while back, when Slovakia devalued and introduced the 
import surcharge, everybody wondered why a turnabout in the 
trade relations did not occur the next day. I spoke then about 
the so-called "J" curve, according to which the balance of 
payments will worsen before it begins to improve. That is 
precisely the phenomenon that took place. After the 
devaluations and import surcharges, the problem of the Slovak 
trade balance continued to worsen a while, and now it began to 
improve. If we did something similar regarding Slovakia, the 
short-term effect would not be at all favorable, and good 
results could come only in the long run. 
  [Krejci] During the recent Sudeten German Days, German 
Government representatives also demanded that the Benes Decrees 
be abolished. Views are even being expressed in our country 
that the decrees were inhumane, first and foremost, because they 
proceeded from collective guilt. What do you think of the Benes 
Decrees and of their possible annulment? 
  [Klaus] The Benes Decrees were a reality of the era in which 
they evolved. At the same time, it is confusing to describe 
them as the Benes Decrees, because the issue involved a 
government resolution that the president of the republic then 
signed. This also involved edicts with which the victorious 
World War II powers agreed. However, it was mainly the Czech 
and Slovak public at that time that applauded them 
enthusiastically. It is impossible to assess slightly 
differently today -- half a century later -- this or that 
phenomenon. The Benes Decrees had certain consequences. The 
idea that it is possible to undo them somehow is 
incomprehensible and alien to me. It simply cannot be done. 
  [Krejci] How, then, do you assess the demands from the 
German side to abolish the decrees? 
  [Klaus] I do not know if it is possible to say "from the 
German side." Let us assess them as partial German demands. 
Are we to allow these few people to dictate to the Czech 
Republic Government what it should have on its agenda, where we 
should go or not go? It seemed curious to me that Mr. Otto von 
Habsburg said, with reference to me in an interview for MLADA 
FRONTA DNES, that my rejection of a dialogue is an expression of 
the weakness of my arguments. This is not true, however. Many 
people recall how, a year ago, I said that I will participate 
cool-headedly in any dialogue. Perhaps, since they do not want 
to hear them at a distance, I could sell them my arguments from 
close by. You know very well that the government coalition has 
come to the conclusion that a direct dialogue will be rejected 
in this country. I fully respect this. However, I can say on 
my own behalf that I would take part in it cool-headedly and 
that in no way would I be afraid of it.

  [Text] With news of the 19th session of parliament's second 
day of business, here is Ivana Anyzova from the parliament 
building. 
  [Anyzova] The deputies of the Czech parliament today 
approved 
an agreement negotiated between the Czech Republic and the 
Republic of Slovakia concerning free trade. As Trade and 
Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy stated, this agreement will 
gradually liberalize bilateral trade, and by the end of the 
two-year transition period -- in other words by 1 January 1996 
-- all tariff and nontariff barriers to trade in all industrial 
products, with the exception of private cars and certain other 
items, will be removed. 
  Parliament also approved the statute of the National 
Property 
Fund of the Czech Republic [FNM]. According to this statute, the 
fund will have the right to set up joint-stock and trading 
companies and to invest in them. Following that, however, 
parliament did not approve the National Property Fund budget for 
1994. Three votes were lacking for the budget to be approved. 
The question thus presents itself whether parliament really has 
so much against it or whether the required number of deputies 
were not present at the final vote, in particular those from the 
governing coalition. At present, the deputies are debating the 
state's final accounts for last year.

<F P=106> [Report by Marica Lalovic from Pale] </F>
  [Text] The session of the people's assembly of the 
republic of Srpska continued behind closed doors in Pale this 
morning. The issues concerning the republic's domestic and 
foreign policy are again on the agenda today, the second day of 
the session. A report by the republican Defense Ministry is 
also on the agenda. The deputies are also expected to discuss 
the continuation of the peace negotiations on the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The negotiations are scheduled to take 
place in Geneva tomorrow [2 June] and were called by Yasushi 
Akashi, special envoy of the UN Secretary General. 
  Commenting on his talks with [Russian Deputy Foreign 
Minister] Vitaliy Churkin yesterday, Momcilo Krajisnik, chairman 
of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, said on his 
arrival in Pale that the vital interests of the Serbian people 
are not for sale, and that the contact group and other 
international community's mediators in the talks on the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have already been made aware of that. 
  Krajisnik stressed that Churkin had said that the delegation 
of the Serbian Republic would travel to Geneva to attend the 
two-day talks on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that this 
did not mean the continuation of the negotiations on the fate of 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Serbian Republic is 
linking to the lifting of sanctions imposed on the Serbian 
people. 
  The special Russian envoy [Churkin] should arrive in 
Sarajevo 
today, where he will probably try to convince Alija Izetbegovic 
and the Muslim side that it is necessary for them to attend the 
negotiations in Geneva.

  [Text] The two-day session of the Assembly of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina concluded today with the adoption of the 
Law on the Government of the Republic, draft law on ministries 
and other state bodies, and the endorsement of a score of other 
ordinances [zakonski akt]. Here is a report by Adnana 
Hadziahmetovic and Zoran Pali on today's Assembly session. 
  [Begin recording] [Hadziahmetovic] According to the draft 
law on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
the deputies adopted today, the government is to perform the 
function of government of the Federation until a final peace 
solution on Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached and implemented. 
  Expounding on this proposal, Dr. Kasim Begic pointed to the 
need to legally and technically coordinate this proposal with 
the first Law on the Government of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that was adopted yesterday. What is involved 
is, as he put it, the government with the same personnel 
composition playing a double role. This legal and technical 
coordination should be done by the Government and the 
Legislative Commission. At the same time, the law on ministries 
and other state bodies of the republic was adopted in the form 
of a draft and deputies will present possible remarks on it to 
the Legislative Commission by 10 June. The law on ministries 
and other state organs of the republic should be adopted at the 
next assembly meeting in 14 days. 
  Deputies of the Republican Assembly today also adopted the 
Law on (?Ratifying) Decrees with Legal Power to the [word 
indistinct] draft decision on endorsing ordinances adopted by 
the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina acting as assembly. 
Presenting the Legislative Commission's decisions on the 
further procedure of adopting these laws and decisions, Dr. 
Kasim Begic made the following proposal: 
  [Begic] All 594 ordinances adopted by the Presidency acting 
as the Assembly should be ratified, thereby ensuring the 
consistency of the functioning of the republic's legal system. 
We also suggest that the Government of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Assembly reexamine all these 
documents, each in detail, within the next three months, so we 
can decide which law, decision, or appointment and dismissal 
[word indistinct], that is, which individual provisions in them 
should be amended or deleted. 
  [Hadziahmetovic] As they did not take part in endorsing 
these decisions, deputies of the Croatian Democratic Community 
will be directly included in the procedure of adopting them. 
  Later at the session, the draft law on Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
independence day was endorsed; the Assembly will decide on it at 
its next session. 
  [Pali] The Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted the 
proposal of the law on the amendments to the law on roads. 
Before adopting the law, deputies Pero Vasilj and Abdulah 
Konjicija took part in the debate. Vasilj said that before 
voting in the Assembly, one should draft a serious program and 
only then discuss it and make decisions. Konjicija spoke of 
several roads used to bring humanitarian aid to Sarajevo and 
added that prices would be lower by one-half of a German mark if 
these roads were repaired. Despite the war and the lack of 
resources, one should plan to repair these roads, Abdulah 
Konjicija said. 
  With 10 votes against and four abstentions, the deputies 
also 
adopted the Law on International Road Transportation. 
  In the second part of the session the deputies attention was 
distracted by the long-awaited draft law on temporarily making 
available to former owners the nationalized offices and city 
development land. Due to the seriousness of the problems with 
this law, it was decided after a brief debate to prepare the 
draft, with certain amendments and improvements, to be adopted 
at the coming session of the Assembly of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At the second day of the session, the Assembly adopted a 
series of legal documents without debate, including the Law on 
Zoning Activity, [word indistinct], and the laws on amendments 
to ordinance on pension insurance in case of war or direct 
danger of war, on military prosecutors' offices, and on regional 
military courts. 
  Concluding the session, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the 
Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in agreement 
with heads of caucuses, convened the next Assembly of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina session for 15 June. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Zagreb, June 1 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said Wednesday that his forces will withdraw from an 
exclusion zone around Gorazde, paving the way for Bosnian Moslem 
participation in peace talks here, UN officials said. A UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] statement said Karadzic sent a 
letter to UN envoy Yasushi Akashi during the day guaranteeing 
the withdrawal from around the eastern Bosnian enclave, in line 
with a NATO ultimatum. 
  "Dr. Karadzic wrote... that as of that day in accordance 
with 
his strictest orders there would be no Serb personnel of any 
description... within the three kilometer zone in Gorazde," the 
statement said. The Bosnian government has said it will not 
take part in the ceasefire talks, due to open Thursday, unless 
Serbs withdraw from a three-kilometer (two-mile) zone around the 
eastern Bosnian enclave. 
  The issue has threatened to scupper the peace talks, to 
which 
political and military leaders of all warring factions have been 
invited, along with all the major international mediators. 
  The UNPROFOR statement added that Akashi "considers that Dr. 
Karadzic's letter, if implemented, provides a sufficient basis 
for the opening of the meeting in Geneva."

  [Excerpt] According to information from the

Bosnia of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, the aggressor's units in 
Gorazde are still 300-400 meters from the town center. This 
once again proves that the aggressor is deceiving the domestic

action by the UN Security Council and NATO and calls for an 
immediate realization of Resolution No. 913 and the NATO 
ultimatum. Since this morning, the Serbo-Montenegrin fascists 
have been opening fire from antiaircraft machine guns and 
antiaircraft guns at Hrenovica and [word indistinct] and from 
antiaircraft machine guns, [words indistinct] and sniper rifles 
at Djinjici, Stupi, Brijegi, and [word indistinct]. There are

  [Text] Doboj, June 2 (TANJUG) -- Moslems continued strong 
attacks on Serb positions in northern Bosnia even though talks 
on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis are scheduled to 
continue Thursday [2 June] in Geneva, where a ceasefire 
agreement is expected to be signed. Moslem forces launched the 
fiercest attacks in the night Wednesday/Thursday and the 
previous day on Serb positions on Mt Ozren, south of Doboj, Serb 
military sources report. 
  The Moslems tried to cut off Serb defense lines launching 
several infantry attacks supported by artillery, but after the 
Serb units fired back and at some places even engaged in 
hand-to-hand combat they returned to their initial positions. 
Moslem attacks continue in the Teslic front, west of Ozren, and 
several Serb villages in this area, including the town of 
Teslic, have come under Moslem artillery fire. Two women were 
killed and two injured in a Moslem artillery attack Wednesday 
afternoon on Doboj and extensive material damage incurred. 
  Simultaneously Serb positions west of Doboj came under 
combined infantry and mortar fire and fresh grouping of Moslem 
forces which were brought in by columns of motor vehicles was 
registered. Around midnight Moslem forces opened strong 
anti-aircraft fire from their positions six kilometers southwest 
of Brcko, a town under Serb control in northern Bosnia, on Serb 
positions, Serb sources report. According to the same sources, 
during the whole night local Croat forces and forces of the 
regular Croatian Army from the region of Orasje, northern Bosnia 
opened light arms fire on Serb positions and villages. 
  In the early morning Thursday Moslem units in the Gradacac 
front, west of Brcko fired 10 shells on Serb positions but the 
Serbs did not return fire.

  [Text] Doboj, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim forces were 
attacking Serb positions in the Teslic area, northern Bosnia, on 
Monday [30 May] and Tuesday night, using all weapons available, 
including missiles charged with poison gases. The brunt of the 
Muslim attack was launched on the southern part of the Teslic 
battlefront and on the Kozilo area, which came under a cannonade 
of artillery shells charged with poison gas, Bosnian Serb army 
sources said on Wednesday. The Serbs were forced to respond 
fiercefully [as received] and neutralize the Muslim shelling in 
order to protect their positions and the people of Teslic and 
the adjacent villages. 
  Serb forces have prevented two Muslim terrorist actions in 
the south-eastern Teslic front. The Serb army sources said that 
Muslim forces at about 5 a.m. (local time) on Wednesday opened 
heavy anti-aircraft gunfire on Serb defence positions in Lukici, 
eight kilometres west of the Serb town of Brcko, in northern 
Bosnia. From the northern Bosnian Croat enclave of Orasje, 
Bosnian Croat forces and Croatia's regular troops on Tuesday 
night opened strong infantry fire on Serb positions seven 
kilometres away from the area, leaving one Serb soldier lightly 
wounded.

  [Begin Sadikovic recording] Along with their standard

crimes they are committing against civilians. 
  The fact that many things are [word indistinct] in Velika

<F P=106> [Article by Zeljko Garmaz: "Will the Livno Bomb Demolish the </F>
Croat-Muslim Pact?"] 
  [Text] When one of the six mosques in Livno, Curcinica, 
built in the first half of the 19th century in the very center 
of Livno, was blown up at 0400 hours on 25 April, this was the 
strongest evidence of the brittleness of the Croat-Muslim 
agreement signed in Washington. Regardless of whether the mosque 
was blown up by radical Croat nationalists, Muslims seeking a 
pretext to continue the war with the Croats, or on the other 
hand Serbs with an interest in demolishing the Washington 
agreement, military and police authorities of Herceg-Bosna 
simply should not have allowed such sabotage to occur, 
especially not in an area so politically delicate. It is worth 
recalling that politicians of Herceg-Bosna had rejected Drazen 
Budisa's statement about the mosque demolished on territory 
under Croatian control precisely by citing the example of Livno, 
which presumably meant that Livno was one of the rare places in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina where interethnic relations were tolerant 
to at least some degree. 
  "Breaches of the Washington agreement are being committed 
both by representatives of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] 
and representatives of the SDA [Democratic Action Party]. They 
sometimes behave as though that agreement had not even been 
signed," we were told by Professor Ivo Komsic, president of the 
Croatian National Council [HNV], whom we talked to by satellite 
telephone on Monday morning, 25 April, before news of the 
mosque's destruction had been published. 
  Negotiations about who would occupy places of leadership in 
the federation were taking place simultaneously with demolition 
of the mosque, and Komsic's judgment about the willingness of 
the Croats and Bosnian Muslims to actually carry out the 
Washington agreement. Although those negotiations were to have 
been completed already, so that the expectation was that on 
Saturday, 23 April, candidates would be proclaimed for president 
of the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and prime minister of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is obvious that an agreement has not 
yet been reached on that, and that no one knows when it will be 
reached. 
  Instead of choosing the highest officials of the joint 
state, 
the two sides are once again lodging accusations against one 
another in official communications, stating, for example, that 
"the Bosnian Muslim side has not performed certain tasks 
contained in the Washington agreement." 
  Finally, even in the Croatian media, after giving preference 
to Bosnia and Herzegovina for a time, are speaking once again 
about Herceg-Bosna as a legal political structure with almost 
the rank of a state. 
  "I strongly reproach the Croatian media for perpetuating in 
this way a quasi-state which the Croats themselves consented to 
abolish in the Washington agreement," says Komsic, president of 
the Croatian National Council. 
<H5>  Provocation or Reflection of Chilled Relations </H5>
  The Livno case, whether it really was only a successful 
provocation or on the other hand a manifestation of really bad 
Croat-Muslim relations, symbolizes most precisely the political 
situation that has cooled once again between Sarajevo on the one 
hand and Zagreb and Grude on the other, following a few weeks of 
public idyll. In Livno itself, which we visited the day after 
the explosion, the reactions of local Croats were utterly 
contradictory. While some Livno inhabitants commented on the 
demolition of the mosque with a smile, saying that the "first 
Muslim missile had been launched," official representatives of 
Croatian authorities condemned this act of sabotage in the 
severest terms. 
  "This vandalism is a direct attack on the honor and dignity 
of the Croatian people of Livno and the Livno area, on the 
rightness of its defense of its native places and the 1,000-year 
presence of Croats in these areas," we were told by Mate 
Franjicevic, assistant commander for political activity of the 
Livno Petar Kresimir IV Livno Brigade of the HVO [Croatian 
Defense Council]. Franjicevic wanted to especially emphasize 
that in the city of Livno, during the entire time of 
Croat-Muslim conflicts, while young Croatian lads were dying at 
the hands of the Muslims, not a single murder was recorded, nor 
was any Muslim religious building demolished, which in other 
places occurred on both sides. 
  "This act seems to have been aimed at furnishing an argument 
to all those who saw demolished mosques in Livno some six months 
ago, since something to that effect was written in some scenario 
cooked up who knows where," Assistant Commander Franjicevic 
believes. 
  Aside from Mr. Franjicevic, other officials of the 
department 
for political activity of the Livno Brigade of the HVO did not 
want to talk about the bombing of the mosque. Instead, the 
GLOBUS journalists in Livno were constantly under the 
supervision of the military police. Thus our crew was frustrated 
in its attempt to photograph the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic 
alongside the remains of the mosque. Two members of the military 
police escorted the GLOBUS reporters to the chief of the 
military and civilian police, who already knew all details about 
their movement in the Livno area that day. 
  The dramatic and shaky atmosphere in Livno, as best 
indicated 
by the nervous behavior of the military police, indicates for 
one thing how difficult it is in the field to reestablish 
cooperation between Croats and Muslims. It seems indeed that 
interethnic tensions are now growing in places where there had 
not been conflicts and that the situation is more difficult than 
in those parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina which were directly 
affected by the Croat-Muslim war. 
  The Livno imam, who was willing to talk even after the 
GLOBUS 
journalists were detained, testified to that. 
<H5>  Has the Washington Agreement Provoked Crimes? </H5>
  "Everything in Livno has taken a turn for the worse since 
the 
Washington agreement," is the opinion of Imam Dizdarevic. "I 
will describe to you a banal example which provides good 
confirmation of this. Before the agreement was signed, we 
Muslims had no problems in Livno if we strolled through the city 
wearing a beret. Now, however, the Croats force us to take it 
off." 
  Another Muslim, who does not allow us to use his name for 
reasons of personal safety, says that since the signing of the 
Washington agreement the Muslims have become slaves in Livno. 
"We have only one restaurant we go to. It is called `Cincar,'" 
this man in his sixties says, and continues: "It is already 
becoming the rule for the soldiers of the HVO to come there at a 
certain time of the day and order the restaurant closed, and 
they lead away all the Muslims who are there to do various 
demeaning jobs for them, from washing dishes in a Croatian 
restaurant all the way to digging foundations for houses the 
Croats are building," our informant described the position of 
Muslims in Livno. 
  "The situation was similar in Podhum, before the mosque was 
also demolished there in October or November last year," says 
the Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic. "That mosque no longer exists 
at all, nor does anyone dare to recall where it stood. To top 
off this farce, they force us Muslims to haul away the stones 
that were left from the demolished mosque," Dizdarevic says, 
convinced nevertheless that the Livno Muslims are in a much 
better position than the Muslims in nearby villages, since 
members of the HVO are said to be taking away their livestock, 
money, tractors, trucks.... 
  According to the 1991 population census, in Livno Opcina 
there were about 5,700 Muslims and 940 "Yugoslavs," who were 
mainly Muslims as well. In the Croatian Defense Council, 
according to a statement by Maj. Gen. Milivoje Petkovic, there 
are more than 1,000 Muslims. Nevertheless, on 21 July 1991 the 
Muslim population was disarmed. There was even fighting in which 
six Muslims were killed. 
  Since the disarmament many Muslims in the Livno area have 
been left unemployed; many have been driven out. It is said that 
little cafes and automobiles are being taken away from the 
Muslims. 
  The Livno Curcinica Mosque, which was bombed very 
professionally at daybreak on 26 April (although the mosque was 
in the center of town, adjoining houses were hardly damaged at 
all), had been subject to bomb attacks before that. 
  Another particularly important element of pressure on the 
Livno Muslims mentioned by GLOBUS informants is the ban on the 
SDA, the leading Muslim party, and the effort to persuade the 
Muslim population to go over en masse to the Muslim Democratic 
Party of Armin Pohara, who is suitable to Zagreb. 
  The same morning when the mosque was blown up in the center 
of Livno, Livno imam Sabir Dizdarevic had his first official 
visit in nine and a half months with Mr. Bakovic, mayor of 
Livno, who said on that occasion that "destruction of the mosque 
is not indicative of the view of Croatian policy towards the 
Muslims." Speaking about the explosion itself, Mr. Bakovic said 
that those forces which are resisting the federation of Croats 
and Muslims as a permanent political solution are most probably 
behind that sabotage. 
  And while in the field the Washington agreement is mainly 
being carried out in its military aspect, in that Generals Roso 
and Delic are really collaborating very well, so that even 
President Komsic of the HNV, usually skeptical towards the 
actions of the HVO, believes that at the moment there is no 
danger that new conflicts will break out, what has been 
happening between Sarajevo and Grude or, perhaps, Mostar) 
suggests very skeptical conclusions about the good intentions of 
the signatories of the agreement on a Croat-Muslim federation in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  "The Constitution of the federation is completely clear. It 
states that the cantons on the area of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
now free are coming together to form a federation. The 
federation, then, is a complex state community consisting of 
cantons, not of two entities with predominantly Croat and 
predominantly Bosnian Muslim populations. That principle of 
ethnicity as the main criterion for creation of the state has 
been rejected in the Washington agreement," Professor Komsic 
believes. 
<H5>  The HDZ Has Gambled Away the Trust of Bosnian Croats </H5>
  Komsic finds the second circumstance that makes it difficult 
to implement the agreement on the federation in the politicians 
who are supposed to carry out that agreement: "I am not certain 
that the politicians in the present leadership of Herceg-Bosna 
are sincerely willing to carry out the Washington agreement. 
They have been conducting a secessionist policy, perhaps some of 
them have even been mixed up in acts like ethnic cleansing. How 
can they now sincerely advocate an integrated Bosnia and 
Herzegovina," Komsic reflects. In response to our direct 
question of whether he thinks that the leadership of 
Herceg-Bosna still has a political option in reserve aside from 
the Washington agreement, Komsic replied in the affirmative. 
  The third main problem in carrying out the Washington 
agreement is the impossibility of achieving consensus on the key 
people of the federation. Dr. Ivo Komsic believes that it is not 
necessary for the Croats at the top level of the federation to 
be represented by a politician from the Croatian Democratic 
Union, since the Croatian Democratic Union, according to Komsic, 
has lost its political legitimacy. "The HDZ has betrayed the 
political conception with which it was victorious in the 1990 
elections, when it favored the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Ever since it allowed itself to become involved in creating the 
quasistate of Herceg-Bosna, the HDZ ceased to be the legitimate 
representative of Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The policy 
imposed by the Washington agreement, which speaks about an 
integral Bosnia and which protects the interests of Croats in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, is contrary to the policy which the HDZ 
has been conducting over the last eighteen months, and that is 
why I really do not think that the Croats should be represented 
at the top level of the federation by a man from the HDZ," Mr. 
Komsic says, himself a candidate opposing Kresimir Zubak, 
president of the presidential council of Herceg-Bosna, for the 
highest Croat political position in the federation. 
  Komsic nevertheless does not reject the possibility that 
Kresimir Zubak will become president of the federation or prime 
minister, "if a political agreement among all parties is 
achieved to that effect, and if the background checks prove that 
Zubak has not compromised himself in what he has done in the 
executive bodies of Herceg-Bosna." 
  Implementation of the Washington agreement is burdened by 
many details and several essential political issues. The most 
important thing, however, is whether the real willingness exists 
on the Croatian and Muslim sides to implement that agreement, to 
establish the federation between Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and 
then also the confederation with the Republic of Croatia. A 
number of events in the past several days -- among which the 
bombing of the mosque in Livno is particularly important 
concerning relations of Croats and Muslims in the field, while 
the failure to reach agreement on the highest government 
representatives of the federation is extremely dangerous from 
the political standpoint -- a number of such events, then, show 
that the Croat-Muslim agreement is in serious trouble.

<F P=106> [Unattributed HINA article: "Is a Battle for the Corridor </F>
Imminent?"] 
  [Text] The Posavina [Sava basin] corridor, a narrow 
zone of about 20 kilometers that links Serbia with the occupied 
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, is narrowest in the 
area of Brcko and Orasje, and in one part is no wider than four 
kilometers, which makes it vulnerable even to light personal 
weapons. 
  Zagreb--Brcko was occupied on 30 April 1992. At dawn, at 
0445, the Serbian army blew up the highway and railroad bridge 
across the Sava, and blocked all approaches to the city. The 
Croatian and Muslim population was expelled en masse, and the 
forces of the HVO [Croatian Defense Forces] and what was then 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Territorial Defense consolidated lines of 
defense in the suburbs of Kozara, Rijeka, Brod, and others. In 
the face of a strong Serbian offensive, however, they withdrew 
further south to a line at the level of Dizdarusa, and in the 
spring of 1993 were driven even further south, to the present 
lines of defense. 
  The HVO, assisted by units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, 
penetrated in September 1992 into the western part of the 
municipality, liberating the villages of Markovic Polje, Gorica, 
and part of Krepsic west of Brcko. Two days later, in the face 
of a strong Serbian offensive, they had to withdraw to their 
original positions. Not even a second attempt to liberate those 
areas, near the end of October 1992, was successful. In a 
violent counterattack, the Serbian forces compelled the HVO 
units to withdraw several kilometers further south 
(Poljaci-Ulovic), where they are located today. 
  Military analysts' assessments published in the press about 
the current balance of power differ, from those saying that the 
Serbs have deployed three reinforced army corps (about 30,000 
soldiers) in that area, to information about 70,000 or more 
Serbian soldiers. Along with others, the Serbs allegedly have 
more than 25 infantry brigades there and powerful equipment: 50 
tanks, 100 armored personnel carriers, 200 heavy cannons, about 
30 heavy-caliber multiple rocket launchers, and 
surface-to-surface missiles. 
<H5>  What Is the Corridor? </H5>
  According to those assessments, the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
forces 
have a numerical advantage in personnel, but are considerably 
behind technically. 
  The so-called Serbian corridor, a narrow zone of about 20 
kilometers that links Serbia and the occupied areas of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the east with the occupied parts of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia in the west, is narrowest in 
parts of the Orasje and Brcko municipalities. The city of Brcko 
is somewhat more than four kilometers away from the northern 
limits of the free territory, while the width of the corridor's 
Orasje-Brcko section is about eight kilometers. At that point 
the main road approaches the line of defense by less than one 
kilometer, and traffic can even be threatened by infantry 
weapons. In that case the Serbs use nearby roads. 
  On the southern side of the corridor, there are mostly 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army (the Tuzla Corps) units and one HVO 
brigade, whose zone of responsibility was the most attacked area 
during the last Serbian offensive. Also, to the north of Orasje 
there are several HVO brigades that withdrew from the occupied 
cities of Bosanska Posavina. The Serbs conducted the strongest 
offensive since the conquest of the corridor from 11 to 24 April 
1994. Against Boderiste alone, a village on the south side of 
the corridor within the zone of responsibility of the 108th HVO 
Infantry Brigade, they fired about 20,000 heavy artillery 
rounds, and carried out about 20 violent infantry attacks 
against that defense point. Prior to that, the free area of 
Brcko had been fairly strongly attacked in July 1993. 
<H5>  Brcko and Orasje </H5>
  According to the last census, more than 87,000 residents 
lived in Brcko, of whom 25.4 percent were Croats, 44.4 percent 
were Muslims, 20.8 percent were Serbs, and 9.5 percent were 
others. Of the 51 municipal settlements, 26 had a Croatian 
majority, and of the total of almost 500 square kilometers of 
municipal land, the Croats were the registered owners of 44.4 
percent. The Serbian corridor passes through 10 Brcko Croatian 
settlements, while 16 of the rest of them are free. In the 
occupied part of the Brcko municipality there are only three 
settlements that had a Serbian majority before the war 
(Potocari, Brezik Donji, and Grbavica). 
  According to the 1991 census, there were more than 28,000 
residents in the Orasje municipality, of whom 75.3 percent were 
Croats, 15 percent were Serbs, 6.7 percent were Muslims, and 3 
percent were others. Almost all the settlements with a Croatian 
majority were defended. In the area of the eight Posavina 
municipalities (Bosanski Brod, Bosanski Samac, Brcko, Derventa, 
Gradacac, Modrica, Odzak, Orasje, and the northern parts of the 
Doboj municipality), not one is completely free, however. The 
total area of the eight municipalities is more than 2,400 square 
kilometers, with 361,000 inhabitants (128,700 Croats, 104,800 
Muslims, and 100,300 Serbs). 
  In any case, according to the territorial proposal of the 
Vance-Owen plan, the Croatian province of Bosanska Posavina 
would encompass 2,103 square kilometers, in which there would 
live 142,400 Croats (56 percent), 47,300 Muslims (18 percent), 
41,000 Serbs (16 percent), and 23,500 others (9 percent). In 
that unit, as data from the HVO Office in Orasje show, 83 
percent of the land would be registered to Croats and Muslims. 
  During the Serbian attacks and occupation, Posavina suffered 
enormous damage: According to the HVO data published a year ago, 
during the occupation of Posavina 2,446 defenders and more than 
1,500 civilians died, and there were 2,600 orphans left. Also, 
8,000 people were wounded, 500 of whom remained invalids. 
According to the same source, about 120,000 inhabitants were 
driven out of Posavina. Data from the Vrhbosanska Diocese 
indicate that of the 46 Catholic parishes in the area of 
northern Bosnia with 160,010 believers, only seven parishes have 
not been (completely) occupied. Previously 44,104 believers 
lived in them, who, however, have mostly left their homes 
because of the "constant firing." Several dozen villages and 
several cities have been completely destroyed, 25 churches have 
been ruined or damaged, about 50 factories have been destroyed, 
four bridges have been ruined, and a rich livestock inventory 
has been destroyed. 
  There are also two oil refineries in Bosanska Posavina, in 
Modrica and Bosanski Brod, both in occupied territory.

    [Editorial Report] In an effort to dispel growing anxiety 
and confusion among the population about the Croatian 
Government's scheduled introduction of the new currency, the 
"kuna," on the 30 May Croatian National Day of Statehood, the 
Zagreb daily VJESNIK published an interview on 9 May with Mladen 
Sunjic, acting director of the Croatian National Bank's Legal 
Department, and a commentary on 10 May by economist Ivo 
Jakovljevic on the National Bank's monetary policy. 
  In his interview Sunjic explained the technical aspects of 
the monetary conversion and sought to clear up misconceptions 
and reassure the population of the soundness of the new legal 
tender. Taking into consideration "negative experiences" people 
had had in the past, he expressed understanding for their 
apprehension that the conversion would not proceed smoothly. He 
emphasized, however, that it is important to "forget the past" 
and "start building trust." Trying to dispel "persistent rumors" 
of devaluation, he emphasized that the conversion of 1,000 
Croatian dinars into one kuna represents a redenomination and 
not a devaluation. Like the old Croatian dinar, the kuna will be 
convertible within Croatia, Sunjic explained, but he declined to 
discuss "at this moment... if and when it will become 
convertible" on international financial markets, because a 
currency cannot be declared convertible "by issuing 
regulations." 
  In the 10 May edition of VJESNIK, commentator Jakovljevic 
examined the financial backing of the kuna -- foreign exchange 
reserves totalling $1.5 billion held by the Croatian National 
Bank and commercial banks -- and contrasted the current 
situation to that of December 1991, when Croatia established its 
"monetary independence" and had to use a temporary currency, the 
Croatian dinar, because the National Bank of Croatia had no 
foreign exchange reserves and those of commercial banks amounted 
to only $200 million. Although he considered present foreign 
exchange reserves sufficient to guarantee a "successful" 
introduction of the kuna as the national currency, Jakovljevic 
nevertheless expressed concern that these reserves will not be 
sufficient to guarantee its long-term security and stability. In 
his view the "real" foreign exchange reserves -- those held by 
the National Bank and currently amounting to only $720 million 
-- must be increased to an "optimum" of $1.4 billion; otherwise, 
the kuna could become "vulnerable" in the second half of 1994. 
These National Bank reserves, he added, must be financed from 
"regular sources," such as the return of capital that fled the 
country, foreign trade surpluses, and foreign investments. In 
conclusion, Jakovljevic recommended that the National Bank 
continue its present monetary policy of building its reserves to 
ensure the value of the kuna over the long term.

<F P=106> [Unattributed HINA article: "Charge Without Evidence"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb -- The RH [Republic of Croatia] Supreme Court 
announced on Tuesday that "at the request of the President of 
the Republic, the RH Supreme Court has investigated and 
established the legal situation concerning the statement by Mr. 
Stipe Mesic: `There have been quite a few murders committed by 
people who are not in prison, although their identity is 
well-known. It is known who killed Reihl-Kir, Saban, Krivokuca 
and the Zec family'" (FERAL TRIBUNE, No. 449, 25 April 1994). 
  The RH Supreme Court reports that in "connection with the 
killing of the Zec family, criminal proceedings have been 
completed, that criminal proceedings are underway in connection 
with the murder of Reihl-Kir, and that so far criminal 
proceedings have not been instituted in connection with the 
murders of Saban and Krivokuca." 
  The news release of the RH Supreme Court states: ``The 
verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now zupanija court in 
Zagreb), as the court in the first instance, dated 9 July 1992 
(VI-K-104/92-86), in its acquittal section, based on Article 
350, Point 3, of the Law on Criminal Procedure (now Article 340, 
Point 3), acquitted the accused Sinisa Rimac of the charges of 
having murdered Mihajlo Zec on 7 December 1991 and of having 
committed the murder of Marija Zec and Aleksandra Zec on 8 
December together with the accused Munib Suljic, Igor Mikola, 
Nebojsa Hodak, and Snezana Zivanovic; that is, it was not proven 
that they committed the crimes of murder under Article 35, 
Paragraph 1, of the KZRH [RH Criminal Code] (now Article 34, 
Paragraph 1), which they were charged with. 
  ``The state's attorney did not appeal the acquittal section 
of the verdict of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija 
court in Zagreb), so that this verdict became final with respect 
to that portion. Thus, the RH Supreme Court, as the court of 
appeals, deliberated in this criminal case, in a session held on 
8 June 1993, only the appeals of the defendants Munib Suljic and 
Sinisa Rimac, filed against the conviction section of that 
verdict, in which the Zec family was not the victim (IKz. 
1270/92-3). 
  ``With respect to that criminal case, the RH Supreme Court 
also ruled on the request of the RH state's attorney for 
protection of legality, filed on 8 March 1993, against the 
decision of the district court in Zagreb (now the zupanija court 
in Zagreb) on 26 March 1992 (Kio-I-35/91), and in a session held 
on 14 July 1993 it rejected in its verdict the request for 
protection of legality as unfounded, since it established that 
there was no violation of the law to which the state's attorney 
referred in his request (KzZ-7/93-3). 
  ``In connection with the murder of Josip Reihl-Kir, we 
report 
that the district public prosecutor's office in Osijek (now the 
district state's attorney's office in Osijek) issued an 
indictment on 25 March 1993 (Kt-148/91), amended in writing on 
12 April 1994, and initiated criminal proceedings against the 
defendant Antun Gudelj, who is at large and inaccessible to 
state authorities, for three cases of perfidious murder (when 
Josip Reihl-Kir was murdered) under Article 35, Paragraph 2, 
Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH (now Article 34, Paragraph 2, 
Subparagraphs 1 and 5) and one crime of attempted perfidious 
murder under Article 35, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of 
the KZRH, related to Article 19, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH 
[Basic Criminal Code of the Republic of Croatia] (now Article 
34, Paragraph 2, Subparagraphs 1 and 5, of the KZRH in 
connection with Article 17, Paragraph 1, of the OKZRH). Criminal 
proceedings are still underway, since the accused, according to 
information in the file, is in Australia or Canada, and so up to 
now, in spite of an international warrant, has not been 
accessible to the state authorities and has not been extradited. 
  ``An inquiry has established that during criminal 
proceedings 
no attempt was made to influence or pressure the courts and 
judges who tried the cases and rendered decisions in these cases. 
  ``As for the murders of Saban and Krivokuca, according to a 
report of the presiding judges of the zupanija courts of 
jurisdiction, criminal proceedings have not so far been 
instituted,'' states the news release of the RH Supreme Court. 
  In conclusion the Supreme Court says that "the courts are 
organized as bodies of judiciary authority, which they perform 
independently and self-sufficiently within the competence 
defined by law. All unfounded objections contrary to this 
operation of the courts we judge to be harmful both to the 
system of the independent and self-sufficient judiciary and also 
to the creation of basic conditions for building Croatia as a 
law-governed state," states the press release signed by Milan 
Vukovic, presiding judge of the RH Supreme Court.

<F P=106> [Article by Damir Dukic: "A Muzzle for `Labrador'"] </F>
  [Text] The arrest of Radojko R. Radojcic, age 42, from 
Zagreb, who was once an official of the Central Committee of the 
League of Communists of Croatia, continues the Labrador affair, 
which has dragged on for two-and-a-half years now, and whose 
exposure, along with the Opera case, is the greatest success of 
the Croatian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs] in the 
intelligence war being waged continuously with the Serbian 
secret services. But those two affairs were at the same time, at 
least until Radojcic's apprehension, only the tip of the 
iceberg, since networks of Serbian informers were largely 
undetected. All of this is clearly supported by the history of 
Labrador itself. 
  At the height of the fiercest aggression of the former JNA 
[Yugoslav People's Army] in the fall of 1991, it became obvious 
that essential information was "leaking" from responsible 
positions in the Croatian Government and that there was for 
certain a group that was conducting in an organized way or 
preparing terrorist actions in order to compromise Croatian 
policy and its top people. One of the most serious confirmations 
of the existence of such groups were the actions of bombing 
Mirogoj, where the graves of Jews are located, and the placing 
of explosives on the building of the Jewish congregation in 
Zagreb, which was aimed at portraying the Croatian Government to 
the world public as neo-Nazi. Suspicions proved to be correct, 
since over the period from 15 to 17 October 1991 the MUP 
initiated an investigation against 12 persons for what was then 
alleged to be "association for the purpose of hostile activity, 
terrorism, commando operations, and sabotage, and in order to 
cause public panic and insecurity." 
<H5>  Five at Large </H5>
  Five of those 12 were at large (among them Radojcic), while 
seven were arrested (Srecko Ozegovic, Branko Trazivuk, Mile 
Vasiljevski...), among them both Croats and Serbs, some of them 
cadres "inherited" from the former regime, while others came to 
their positions after the change of government. The group, which 
came to be called Labrador from its own plan of operations, 
consisted of three "security" officers, four officials in the 
MUP department for protection of the constitutional order, one 
authorized official of the MUP, two from the technical services 
of the Croatian parliament, a former policeman from the Zagreb 
Police Department, and another person not employed. The group 
was led and inspired from Belgrade, which was also the origin of 
the equipment in the form of the time bombs. 
  It was only a short time after the processing of the 
arrestees that the Croatian police brought in another 50 persons 
suspected of the same crimes. Milan Brezak, assistant minister 
of internal affairs, himself declared in early November that 
some of these people were sitting in offices next to his, and 
they were planning to blow up important facilities, to 
assassinate leading figures.... The investigation has made 
progress, revealing an incredibly intertwined KOS 
[counterintelligence service] network, which was later confirmed 
in a newspaper interview by Ante Nobilo, former deputy district 
public prosecutor in Zagreb, who said that the investigation had 
penetrated an increasing number of political circles, revealing 
new members of KOS. 
<H5>  The Belgrade Trial </H5>
  However, before the investigation was concluded and the 
suspects thoroughly questioned, the arrestees were released, 
that is, exchanged, on the basis of a political assessment. 
Thus, further investigatory proceedings were stopped before all 
the KOS connections and all the informers were discovered. 
  This assessment was later confirmed by Lt. Col. Ivan 
Sabolovic, who was tried in Belgrade for the bombing of Jewish 
facilities in Zagreb. Sabolovic said that only a part of the 
network was blown, since their essential structures remained 
untouched. Just like Sabolovic, certain other essential 
organizers of the KOS networks in Croatia also remained out of 
the reach of Croatian authorities, and this especially applies 
to Col. Slobodan Rakocevic, former security chief in the "JNA 
Air Force," who incidentally had the closest connections with 
the Opera group (propaganda operations), another espionage 
organization with the same tasks against Croatia. Nor was Slavko 
Malobabic, who with five other persons was one of the principal 
organizers of Labrador, accessible to Croatian authorities. 
Since Malobabic was known in Zagreb as a "man with good 
connections and friends" (at one time he held the position of 
chief of staff of Stanko Stojcevic, chief of the Croatian 
communists, and then the post of spokesman of the Secretariat 
for Internal Affairs), one of the tasks that he and Radojcic had 
was to bring new members into the group and expand the network. 
It is still a secret how successful they were in that, and how 
far they went in this espionage effort. Until Radojcic's recent 
apprehension, when, we hope, the links of this dangerous chain 
were completely revealed.

<F P=106> [Report by D.E.: "Economic Strategy for Poland; Rapid </F>
Development, Lower Costs"] 
  [Text] During the weekend session of the All-Polish Trade 
Unions Agreement, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, presented the concept of the "Strategy for 
Poland," prepared by the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party 
and the Democratic Left Alliance. The document specifies the 
goals that the coalition government will strive to achieve 
between 1994 and 1997, and envisions the measures that need to 
be taken and the threats that may arise. On Tuesday the strategy 
was discussed at the session of the government. On Monday the 
document reached the various ministers. 
  The "strategy" should contribute to the maintenance of a 
high 
rate of economic development. Between 1994 and 1997 the GDP may 
increase by approximately 22 percent, that is, by approximately 
5 percent a year on average. Real consumption will increase by 
more than 10 percent. The rapid increase is to be accompanied by 
macroeconomic and systemic stabilization of the economy, which 
will lie, among other things, in the lowering of the rate of 
increase of the public debt: In 2004 it should not exceed 60 
percent of GDP. The budget deficit should drop from over 6 
percent in 1992 to approximately 2-3 percent in 1997. The 
inflation rate should be lowered to a single-digit figure by 
1997. One of the fundamental springboards of the economic 
development will be production for export. 
  The document draws particularly great attention to the 
lowering of the social costs of reforms, the improvement of the 
living conditions (it is envisioned that the average wage will 
rise by 10 percent and the average retirement pension -- by 7 
percent); it also stresses just, efficiency-oriented principles 
of shaping wages and social insurances. It is expected that 
greater pressure will be placed on active forms of combating 
unemployment, whose rate should decrease from the current 16 
percent to less than 14 percent at the end of 1997. 
  Here are some of the other main goals that are included in 
the "Strategy": striving for a rapid integration with the 
European Union, economic competitiveness on an international 
level, and reform of the economic center. 
  Apart from this general section, the "Strategy" also 
contains 
10 main programs detailing the diagnoses, goals to be achieved, 
planned measures, possible threats, as well as execution 
criteria of achieving the main goals in such spheres, among 
others, as wages, unemployment, development of the rural areas, 
and development of the banking sector. Below we have briefly 
discussed this detailed section of the document; we have drawn 
attention mainly to the measures proposed and to the criteria of 
execution. The latter are not quantitive, but only qualitative. 
Despite that, in the future they will help evaluate the degree 
to which the various intentions of the government have been put 
into effect. 
<H5>  Partnership-Like Labor Relationships and Negotiation-Related </H5>
Mechanism of Wage Regulation 
  The government wants to create modern labor relationships. 
The negotiation-related and decentralized mechanism of wage 
regulation will assign the state the role of an arbiter that 
resolves disputes between employers and employees. 
  This goal is to be achieved, among other things, through the 
amendment of the Labor Code; as a result, it will become 
possible, among other things, to: 
  -- conclude collective work agreements at the level of 
enterprises, branches, and branches and regions; 
  -- impose on the employer the duty of notifying the employee 
on the cause of an intended layoff; the employee will be 
guaranteed the right to submit reservations; 
  -- adjust the leave law to the requirements specified in the 
132 MOP [expansion unknown] Convention (among other things, 
increase the minimum leave, create legal guarantees allowing the 
use of leave every year); 
  -- prohibit the employee from conducting any activities 
which 
compete with the employer during the period in which he is 
employed and for a year after this period. 
  Other plans are as follows: 
  1. Forming -- in democratic elections, in all companies both 
public and private employing more than 20 persons -- enterprise 
councils as supra-union employees' organs entitled to conclude 
agreements at the enterprise level. 
  2. Amending a packet of laws: on trade unions, on the 
organizations of employers, and on the resolution of collective 
bargaining; accepting such an interpretation of these laws which 
would guarantee a balance between the collective parties and the 
work relationships. 
  3. The status of the Tripartite Commission for 
Social-Economic Issues, acting at the central level, will soon 
be regulated. Apart from issuing opinions, the commission will 
be entitled to launch legislative initiatives, the contents of 
which would be binding for all parties. 
  Possible threats here are the barriers and possibilities of 
the economy's development and lack of progress in the 
restructurization of the economy, particularly in the ownership, 
organizational, substantive, technological, and regional spheres. 
  The government wants to treat the decline in the number of 
working days lost by the economy as a result of strikes as a 
criterion for the execution of this plan. 

<H5>    Reform of the System of Social Insurance </H5>
  The government sees the issue of a systemic resolution of 
the 
issue of the social insurance as one of the priorities of its 
activities. A complex concept of reforming this sphere is being 
prepared; preparations are also under way to implement it. It 
must be realized, however, that the entire process will take 
from 10 to 20 years to complete. At the same time steps will be 
taken to increase the efficiency of the existing system. 
  One of the goals is to decrease the system's tendency to 
create conflicts, through the enhancement of its clarity and the 
individualization of the accounts of the individual participants 
of the system; to gradually decrease the insurance premium 
(which now amounts to 49 percent, along with the Labor Fund), 
until a proportion comparable to the world level (approximately 
25 percent) is reached. 
  Between 1994 and 1997: 
  1. The law on financing and organizing social insurances and 
the law on the Social Insurance Agency will be changed; 
  2. There will be an individualization of the accounts of the 
individual participants of the system; 
  3. Principles of paying the subscriptions by employees and 
employers will be introduced which will make it possible to 
control the state of the account by any interested person at any 
time; as a result, private and state-owned companies will better 
observe the discipline of paying the premiums, which will 
increase the budget's revenues; 
  4. Identification cards will be introduced for all citizens; 
on the basis of the cards, events influencing the state of the 
account of each insured person will be registered; 
  5. The legal, institutional, and organizational framework of 
the functioning of the retirement pension funds and of the 
functioning of insurance companies will be created; 
  6. The present tax system will be modified in such a way as 
to make it possible for employees and employers to include the 
insurance premiums in the costs of obtaining the gains. 
  Moreover, the following is to be expected: 
  -- decreasing the number of persons entitled to retirement 
benefits by prolonging the required employment period, equaling 
the retirement age of men and women, and sharpening the 
principles of retiring at an earlier age; 
  -- suspending the benefits, if a certain income level is 
achieved, in the case of persons who are continuing (taking on) 
a job after acquiring retirement rights; 
  -- changing the rules of the valorization of retirement and 
disability pensions (departing from the indexation in relation 
to the wage movement, in favor of adjustments to price changes; 
[no closing parentheses as published] 
  -- decreasing the number of persons receiving invalids' 
pensions, by making detailed diagnoses of the health condition, 
by emphasizing rehabilitation before the pension is granted, by 
sharpening the criteria of granting invalids' privileges 
(especially in the case of persons who have maintained the 
ability to work -- for example, liquidation of the third invalid 
group); 
  -- regulating the payments of peasants' subscriptions to 
KRUS 
[expansion unknown]; 
  -- standardizing the rules of paying sick leave and 
maternity 
leave benefits in all sectors of the economy; 
  -- enhancing the efficiency of solutions in the sphere of 
social protection for unemployed persons; placing emphasis on 
the control of the access to social benefits and using them as 
motivational factors. 
  The government wants to treat the decrease in the share of 
expenditures on social insurances in the budget's total 
expenditures as a criterion for the execution of the plan. 
<H5>  Countering Unemployment </H5>
  In this sphere the government wants to pass on to an active 
policy, the intention of which is the stimulation of the process 
of creating new work places as well as the protection of public 
finances. 
  The goals that have been set are as follows: gradually 
lowering the unemployment rate, especially between 1995 and 
1997, combating the chronic unemployment, and decreasing the 
scale of unemployment among young people. 
  The main measures that are expected to be taken are as 
follows: 
  1. Strengthening the pro-investment policy; 
  2. Linking modernization and restructurization programs more 
closely to the situation on the labor market. 
  The demand for labor will be increased, among other things, 
by great investment undertakings, initiated by the government, 
linked to the modernization of the technical infrastructure of 
the country; they will concern, among other things, the 
modernization of the road network and the construction of super 
highways, the development of the telecommunications, 
modernization of the railroads system, development of the 
natural gas supply system. 
  There will be a chance to limit unemployment and minimize 
its 
social results through the creation of special economic zones on 
the foundation of companies with a rich technical 
infrastructure, companies which have manufacturing property that 
is not fully utilized and which employ highly-qualified 
employees. One of the criteria of the evaluation of 
privatization undertakings is the protection of work places. 
This not only requires that clauses concerning the level of the 
guaranteed employment are taken into account in contracts; it 
also requires investment commitments whose implementation will 
make it possible to maintain the existing work places and create 
new ones. 
  The policy of countering unemployment will be carried out 
at the regional level to a considerable degree; the criteria of 
including local labor markets in the group that falls under 
special activities will be sharpened. In these areas the 
instruments that are supposed to cause an increase in employment 
will be strengthened and concentrated. These will include, among 
others: Entitlement to an accelerated amortization of fixed 
assets, tax allowances for the training of employees and 
apprentices provided by individuals conducting economic 
activity, increasing of the employment limit which will not 
result in the loss of the right to pay taxes in the form of the 
tax charter, for a certain period -- due to investment 
expenditure [as published], credit guarantees for small and 
medium-sized companies, granting unemployment benefits directly 
to the employers of the unemployed persons. 
  The following will be carried out in the social protection 
system: 
  1. Modification of the principles of paying unemployment 
benefits; greater emphasis will be put on the material situation 
of the family of the unemployed person and on the differences in 
the situation on local labor markets; 
  2. Change in the conditions of paying unemployment benefits 
and in the registration of the unemployed; unemployed persons 
who refuse to accept an offered job or training will be denied 
the right to unemployment benefits for a certain period or 
permanently; 
  3. A separate unemployment insurance will be introduced and 
a 
special insurance fund will be created, made up of the 
subscriptions of employers and employees, and earmarked 
exclusively for unemployment benefits. The establishment of the 
unemployment insurance will lessen the burden on the state 
budget -- the burden of financing unemployment benefits, and it 
will allow an increase in the amount of money allocated for 
active stimulation of employment. The introduction of an 
insurance-related form of financing the unemployment benefits 
will require (with the current scale of unemployment) that 
subscriptions be set at the level of approximately 7-7.5 percent 
of the wage fund. 
  The main criterion of execution will be the decrease in the 
unemployment rate. 
<H5>  Development of Rural Areas </H5>
  The strategic goal in this sphere is to help Polish 
agriculture and rural areas reach the standard of the 
highly-developed European countries, because this is the only 
way to defend Polish agriculture and peasants from foreign 
competition. 
  Development in the conditions of the functioning of the 
market mechanism will consist of a gradual limitation of the 
rank of agriculture and an increase in the role of food 
processing and distribution. This will be accompanied by the 
strengthening of economically strong farms, as well as the 
departure of weak and inefficient entities from agricultural 
production. Following are methods that will be used to stimulate 
these processes: 
  1. Stimulation of nonagricultural activities; 
  2. Interventionism, that is, a long-term, not a temporary, 
program of the state's aid for agriculure. Intervention of the 
state will assume the form of targeted aid, and will lead to an 
acceleration of structural transformations in agriculture and to 
the creation of work places in rural sectors other than 
agriculture. 
  The government will consistently limit direct, nontargeted 
intervention, which merely conserves the inefficient system of 
production, perpetuates old structures, and defers the 
indispensable process of transformations, by taking on a social 
function. 
  The government will work out detailed programs of assistance 
targeted for specific types of farms; it will define the 
conditions that the peasant and the farm must satisfy to be able 
to take advantage of the assistance; the document will also set 
down the forms of assistance and methods of returning it (return 
payments). So-called cheap credits for agriculture will be a 
limited form of assistance and will be available only to young 
peasants (to help them get started) and to farms which, with the 
help of the state, will pass through a period of transformation 
more quickly and which, after modernizing, will be able to pay 
off the credit. 
  The state will provide support and assistance in the 
financing of: 
  -- the biological progress, peasant and social consulting, 
investments which result in the lowering of costs, improving 
quality, and limiting food losses; 
  -- the development of the infrastructure, education, and 
various forms of training that will help peasants change their 
professions and work outside agriculture; the provision of 
elementary vocational training. 
  Emphasis will be placed on the development of vertical 
integration, especially on the basis of its simpler form -- 
contracts between peasants and the government for the supply of 
agricultural products. This is an alternative to the central 
limitation of production. 
  The main fears concerning the changes in this sphere is the 
danger of conserving the existing situation in agriculture and 
the creation of barriers around Polish agriculture which protect 
it from foreign competition. 
  The main criterion of execution will be an increase in the 
percentage of inhabitants of rural areas that are employed 
outside agriculture in the total number of the population living 
in rural areas. 

<H5>    Investing in Human Capital </H5>
  It is the government's view that the low amounts that were 
spent for many years on education and training, constitute a 
fundamental obstacle to restructuring the Polish economy today, 
as well as a factor impeding our international competitiveness. 
Therefore, the government will provide conditions conducive to 
investments, both by public and private subjects. 
  The goal, among others, is to widen the scope of educating 
the youth at high school and university levels. 
  In this area, the following can be expected: 


    -  Gradual exclusion from the tax basis [podstawa 
opodatkowania] with regard to individual incomes, of part of the 
expenditures borne on investing in human capital; 
  -  Inclusion of 
part of the expenditures borne on books, professional journals, 
scientific equipment and its software, into the cost of 
obtaining profit by teachers; 
  -  Exclusion from the tax basis of 
donations for public educational, scientific, cultural, and 
health protection units. 

  The main criterion for execution will be an increasing role 
of expenditures borne on education, science, culture, and health 
protection, in the GDP. 
<H5>  Managing State-Owned Wealth and Processes of Ownership </H5>
Transformations 
  The main goal which the government wants to achieve will be 
a 
clear improvement in the management of state-owned property 
through the establishment of strong, efficient, and productive 
management structures. This will be accomplished, among others, 
by transformations in the constitutive fundamentals of 
state-owned enterprises, strengthening the independence of the 
managements of state-owned enterprises of administrative organs, 
stabilization of the managing cadre, stabilization of the 
managing cadre through the application of managerial contracts 
and strong economic incentives, and an institutional separation 
of the State Treasury. 
  Shortly, the government, in cooperation with the concerned 
parties, will define areas of the state's crucial interests in 
which no ownership transformations are being planned, it will 
indicate an enterprise destined for privatization, and it will 
create the proper conditions for an efficient and speedy 
dissolution and bankruptcy process. 
  The main means of implementation are: 


    -  Commercialization of state-owned enterprises and an 
institutionalization of the State Treasury; 
  -  Setting in motion of 
the Program of Popular Privatization by establishing National 
Investment Funds; 
  -  Implementation of the 
"Stabilization-Restructuring- Privatization" program which is 
being introduced with organizational and financial participation 
by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The 
program covers those enterprises which are in a particularly 
difficult situation, and which will be subject to a process of 
bringing them back to health; 
  -  Continuation of the process of 
financial restructuring of state-owned enterprises and banks 
(which was begun in 1993); 
  -  Implementation of a long-term program 
of financial, asset- related, and organizational restructuring 
of those sectors which are particularly significant to the 
economy, like mining, the steel industry, the arms industry, and 
so on; 
  -  Privatization of the Polish economy by using all possible 
privatization and decentralization-of-privatization-decisions 
techniques. Among others, the following will take place: 

  -- Speeding up the sale of small and medium enterprises into 
leasing by employee companies, through a simplification of the 
procedures and a liberalization of the terms of leasing; 
  -- Introduction of a new institution of State Treasury 
companies with employees or other private investors, enabling 
partial privatization, with the possibility of conducting 
full-scale privatization in the future, with the participation 
of the same or other investors; 


    -  Undertaking rectification measures in enterprises that 
do not meet the criteria which are indispensable in the process 
of commercialization; 
  -  Speeding up the process of dissolving 
enterprises which are continuously ineffective. 

  The main criterion of performance is an increase in the 
contribution of the private sector to the GDP. 

<H5>    Medium-Term Financial Strategy </H5>
  Meeting repayments and servicing the cost of the foreign 
debt, requires development of the sector of production of 
export-bound goods and also of goods which are substitutive in 
relation to imports. It is a key issue in the long-term policy 
of a stable equilibrium in the balance of payments. 
  The financial strategy for the years 1994-97 is subordinated 
to the goal of implementing the fundamental goals of the 
economic and social program, that is to say, maintaining the 
rate of real economic growth at the level of about 5 percent per 
year, and a reduction of the inflation rate below the level of 
10 percent in 1997. 
  Here are the main goals of the government's medium-term 
financial strategy: 


    -  Gradual return to a balance in the budget sector. It 
will be taking place through a reduction of the deficits 
occurring in that sector vis-a-vis the GDP, from 3.9 percent in 
1994 down to 2-3 percent in 1997, and also through a 
stabilization of the internal public debt at the level of below 
90 percent of GDP and a lessening of the cost of servicing the 
debt from about 4 percent of the GDP in 1994 down to 2.5 percent 
in 1997. This will make it possible to halt the decreasing trend 
occurring in the size of bank credits granted to the 
nonfinancial sector, and to accomplish a real growth of these 
credits at a rate that would approximate the real growth in the 
GDP; 
  -  Mobilization of domestic savings and an improvement in the 
banking system's credit potential, as well as developing the 
financial and capital market; 
  -  Maintaining the rate of real 
growth in expenditures and revenues in the 1994-97 period at 
below the rate of growth of the real GDP, and also maintaining 
the rate of real expenditure growth at below the level of the 
rate of real revenue growth; 
  -  Stabilization of the growth of 
foreign currency reserves (but the document fails to define at 
what level), despite a negative foreign-trade balance when it 
comes to routine turnover in the entire period up to 
1997; 
  -  Gradual reduction of the foreign trade deficit vis-a-vis 
the GDP, as a result of a real and almost 1.5-time growth in 
exports compared with the growth in GDP, and as a result of 
reducing the distance between the real rate of import growth and 
the rate of general economic growth; 
  -  Maintaining the stable 
situation in the balance of payments over the medium term, with 
a very strict observance of repayments due and of servicing the 
foreign debt, in accordance with stipulations agreed upon with 
the Paris and London Clubs; 
  -  Denomination of the zloty and 
introduction into circulation of new banknotes and coins 
effective 1 January 1995. 

  Monetary policies will play a fundamental role in 
stabilizing 
the economy. The main instruments of that policy shall be: 


    -  Maintaining credits for the nonfinancial sector in 
relation to the GDP at the level which is expected at the end of 
this year, that is about 19.5 percent; 
  -  A fall in real and 
nominal interest rates; the process will be influenced by the 
restructuring and by injecting additional capital into the 
banking sector, as well as by a gradual reduction of the rate of 
mandatory reserves; 
  -  A clearly slower rate of reduction of 
interest rates on bank deposits than a reduction of interest 
rates on export credits, along with (in the initial stage) 
guarantees by the state budget; 
  -  The kind of policies of foreign 
currency exchange rates which will maintain a stable relation of 
the zloty's real value to convertible currencies, with a 
simultaneous observance of the principle of a creeping growth of 
the exchange rate, which would be ever decreasing, along with a 
fall in the inflation rate; 
  -  A gradual change in the tax 
structure, which would be aimed at increasing the role of 
indirect taxes in general tax revenues, with a gradual reduction 
in the burden of income taxes, especially through a wider 
application of tax breaks; 
  -  An increased discipline of budget 
expenditures, including a reduction of the cost of servicing the 
domestic public debt, as well as slowing down the excessive rate 
of growth of expenditures borne on retirement pensions, other 
kinds of pensions, and social transfers. A fundamental part in 
that regard will be played by: A reform in the system of social 
insurance, establishment of retirement-pension funds, changing 
the principles of indexing of retirement and other kinds of 
pensions, a reduction of the cost of social protection along 
with targeting those social groups that are really the most 
needy, as the recipients of that protection; 
  -  At least a partial 
inclusion of the results of the activity of the economic "gray 
area" into the tax rate basis ("tax basis"). 

  The main risk lies in the danger of inflation. Its return -- 
or a reduction which would be lower than assumed in the program 
-- will automatically mean a decreased reduction of interest 
rates and deteriorated conditions for investment and economic 
growth. 
  The main criterion of execution will be a fall in the 
relation of public debt to the GDP. 

<H5>    Development and Reforms of Financial Sector </H5>
  The government's main strategic goal is to take further 
measures for the sake of developing a strong, diversified, and 
efficient financial system. Measures will be continued for the 
sake of strengthening the National Bank of Poland's [NBP] 
independence and position as the state's currency-issuing bank 
and the government's financial agent, with a simultaneous 
freeing of NBP of ownership-investment and supervision 
functions. The government's policies toward the banking sector 
will be very clearly aimed at making its role in the process of 
economic growth more active through injecting additional capital 
into the banks, an improvement in the security of economic 
turnover, and so forth. 
  Stimulation and supporting the process of consolidation of 
commercial banks is supposed to be accomplished through, among 
others: 


    -  Supporting the process of more efficient and stronger 
banks taking over weaker banks which are incapable of acting on 
their own; 
  -  Attaching inefficient banks acting in the form of 
Treasury-owned joint-stock companies, to those banks which are 
the State Treasury's property, and which have demonstrated a 
capability to generate profit for the owner and a simultaneous 
rise in the real value of their own funds; 
  -  Establishment of 
regional and supraregional banks, with the ultimate goal of 
establishing between 10 and 20 of them in Poland; 
  -  Establishment 
of a network of specialized banks, geared toward servicing 
specific kinds of activity, specific markets, types of 
operations, and so forth; 
  -  Transforming employee "grant-and-loan 
funds" [kasy zapomogowo-pozyczkowe] and cooperative 
savings-and-credit funds, into local funds and societies of 
credit self-help. 

  A Bank Guarantee Fund will be established which will 
function 
as a guarantor of bank deposits. This will take the burden off 
the central bank and the state budget in terms of responsibility 
in that area. 
  An independent organ of banking supervision will be 
separated 
from NBP's structure, giving it the importance of a chief 
supervision organ. 
  Gradual consolidation and demonopolization of the insurance 
sector will be conducted, among others through supporting the 
process of integration among small insurance companies and 
applying selectivity in granting licenses to foreign firms. 
  By the end of 1994, an insurance supervision division will 
be 
established within the Finance Ministry, and an independent 
Office of Insurance Supervision will be established. 
  Before the end of 1994, the proper conditions will be 
created, enabling operation of both closed and open (of the 
"Pioneer" type) trust funds. 
  The government will support the process of entry into the 
market by institutional investors other than trust funds, like 
insurance companies, retirement pension funds, and to some 
extent also banks, especially those which are geared toward 
investment activities and toward guaranteeing new issues 
[emisje]. 
  The government will support the establishment of venture 
funds [preceding two words in English] to diversify the sources 
of financing developmental ventures of a high risk factor, which 
by definition cannot be covered by financing coming from banks. 
  A further development of the Warsaw Stock Exchange will be 
continued, among others through the building of a second and 
third hall. At the same time, measures will be undertaken to 
initiate a stock exchange for date operations [gielda operacji 
terminowych] for foreign currencies and stock-market instruments. 
  The main criterion of performance is a reduction of the 
differences between interest rates on deposits and interest 
rates on credits. 
<H5>  Security of Economic Transactions and Absorption of "Gray </H5>
Area" 
  Development of the so-called "gray area" is a result (and 
also the reason) of the lack of security of economic 
transactions. 
  Therefore, the government will make efforts to: 


    -  Popularize noncash transactions by using bills of 
exchange, and by securing executability of claims arising out of 
bills of exchange; 
  -  Encourage the use of checks in economic 
transactions; 
  -  Prevent many crimes in banking, checks, and bills 
of exchange transactions, and also increase the rate of 
detection of these crimes; 
  -  Introduce a uniform system of 
rendering payments by using magnetic cards (including 
foreign-made ones); 
  -  Introduce the obligation to have a bank 
account by every economic unit fulfilling specific criteria (for 
instance involvement in economic transactions); 
  -  Improve the 
system of bank noncash settlements, among others through 
supporting the work conducted by the National Settlement 
Chamber; 
  -  Introduce institutional barriers to prevent so-called 
money laundering. 

  In relations with foreign countries, and especially in the 
state's foreign-currency policies, limitations on capital 
transfers out of Poland, shall be maintained over the next few 
years. Some provisions for protecting Polish investments will be 
widened, through conclusion of bilateral agreements on 
protecting and supporting investments. 
  Perfecting institutional mechanisms in the area of taxes on 
merchandise and services, is being planned (widening the subject 
and object scope of the tax; perfecting the system of turnover 
taxes; eliminating unfair competition; imposing taxes on 
unregistered activity, mainly in the so-called "gray area," 
which will be accomplished through a continuously updated and 
uniform database on taxpayers; a duty to apply fiscal cash boxes 
[kasy fiskalne] in retail trade and other popular services, 
which will be introduced in stages; improving the system of 
documentation and circulation of documents, among others with 
the goal of mutual identification of taxpayers). 
  Further measures include, among others, the widening of the 
scope of investment breaks in income tax, establishment of a 
popular taxpayer database, introduction by the Finance Ministry 
of a complete and comprehensive information system of real 
estate for fiscal purposes, and creating incentives and the 
proper conditions for revealing the entire profit by registered 
companies. 
  Effective in 1995, customs services will be subordinated to 
the finance minister, making it possible to comprehensively 
settle customs and tax payments by just one integrated apparatus. 
  In addition, the following will be accomplished: 


    -  Establishing an institution of deposit insurance which 
will operate in the form of a fund, guaranteeing bank deposits 
by individuals and by economic units; 
  -  Establishing a credit 
insurance fund, with the participation of the State Treasury, 
and with the goal of providing credit guarantees for small- and 
medium-size enterprises which do not have their own capital -- 
the fund will make it possible to obtain credits by conventional 
means. 

  The main criterion of execution is a fall in the rate of 
economic crime, and a widening of the tax basis. 
<H5>  International Competitiveness of Polish Economy </H5>
  The main goals are: 


    -  Establishment of a modern economy that would be 
characterized by a significant contribution of exports to the 
GDP, and a beneficial position in international 
trade; 
  -  Establishment of the proper conditions that would attract 
foreign capital and effectively use it in the process of 
development; 
  -  Poland's integration with the world economy 
(European Union, European Free Trade Association, CEFTA), and 
Poland's institutional presence in the system of international 
cooperation. 

  The main means of accomplishment are: 


    -  Persistent implementation of the already existing 
programs of action, like: Fundamentals of the states' pro-export 
policies, timeframe for the implementation of the state's 
pro-export policies, programs supporting Eastern policies, 
fundamentals of the policies of economic cooperation with 
countries of the former USSR, East and Central Europe, and with 
China; 
  -  Continuation of the process of building a network of 
treaty-based agreements which will open up the cooperation of 
Polish and foreign economic units, with the goal of a 
geographical widening of markets; 
  -  Intensification of promotion 
of exports, especially to European countries, and also to China, 
Japan, India, countries of Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, 
and the Middle East; 
  -  Preparing a draft law concerning insurance 
with regard to export credits from noncommercial risk, as well 
as strengthening and enlarging the Corporation for Export Credit 
Insurance.

  [Text] Belgrade, 1 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Federal Government 
received with indignation the news about a barbaric and 
terrorist act committed by an unidentified perpetrator who 
planted explosives at the entrance to a Catholic church in 
Subotica last night. The Federal Government most vehemently 
condemns this terrorist act as an obvious attempt to instigate 
unrest and cause divisions and distrust among citizens of the 
multiethnic town of Subotica. It also emphasizes its firm 
resolve in pursuing a policy of protection and strengthening of 
equality of all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, 
regardless of their nationality and religion. 
  The Federal Government will take energetic measures to find 
the unidentified perpetrator and establish his responsibility as 
soon as possible. The Federal Government stresses that there 
should be complete trust in the relevant state bodies, who will 
inform the public about the findings of their investigation and 
take the necessary measures to prevent further threats to 
religious facilities and ensure a peaceful life and security for 
the citizens.

    [Editorial Report] The expulsion of foreign journalists 
ordered by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's Ministry of 
Information has drawn protests from a variety of Serbian 
organizations, including opposition political parties, 
journalists and writers, and an independent trade union. While 
Federal Secretary for Information Slobodan Ignjatovic, in a 
statement carried by Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service on 12 
April, accused AFP and CNN of "waging a fierce media war against 
Yugoslavia... on the territory of Yugoslavia," those who have 
protested the expulsion decision have said they view it as a 
serious mistake that violates freedom of thought and political 
expression and is detrimental to the interests of the country. 
Some also see it as foreshadowing action against domestic 
journalists. 
  The 14 April issue of BORBA contains several articles 
expressing what the editor called "stormy reaction to the 
decision by the Federal Ministry of Information to withdraw the 
credentials of CNN and AFP journalists." One of the articles, 
titled "High-Risk Ban," presented the Serbian Renewal Party's 
view that the expulsions were an alarming warning that Serbia is 
going through the process of reintroducing bolshevism and 
isolating itself from the world, a development that is a serious 
threat to lasting peace, the lifting of sanctions, and monetary 
and economic reforms. 
  Another article reported the reaction of the Serbian 
Democratic Party [DSS], which charged that the Ministry of 
Information had itself "significantly contributed" to the 
"biased views" of the foreign media by failing to inform foreign 
journalists "about the real causes and consequences of this 
civil war." Now, according to the DSS, the ministry had made 
another serious mistake. Instead of helping journalists to 
witness developments, the ministry has forced them to seek 
information exclusively from "the other side." 
  In a third article, titled "Step Toward Further Isolation," 
the Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia declared 
that the withdrawal of credentials of any foreign or domestic 
journalist was " contradictory to the fundamental right to be 
informed, which is an important aspect of human rights in 
general." 
  Under the title "Cancel That Decision," BORBA of 19 April 
published a statement by the Serbian PEN [International 
Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and 
Novelists] organization, stressing that "withdrawal of foreign 
journalists' credentials represents a rude violation of one of 
the fundamental principles of the charter of PEN, which 
specifically strives to secure the free exchange of information 
and opposes all forms of censorship.... Such acts... are 
plunging the Serbian people further into isolation and away from 
the world community. Therefore, the aforementioned decision must 
be retracted and cancelled." 
  On the same page, BORBA carried a statement by the 
Association of Writers of Serbia titled "Attack Against Freedom 
of Thought and Interpretation of Facts." It called the expulsion 
order "a dangerous policy of preventing the free flow of 
information" and charged that "if this trend continues, Serbia's 
spiritual space will become a hopeless wasteland, completely 
isolated from all media." 
  These groups were joined by the "Nezavisnost" (Independence) 
Association of City Trade Unions in strongly criticizing the 
Serbian Government. It pointed out ironically that the "purge of 
foreign journalists sheds much more light on the actual 
objectives of this latest democratic offensive by the Serbian 
authorities." This is "only a warm-up... before the final 
showdown with domestic journalists who think differently." 
  Nezavisnost's prediction about the ultimate domestic media 
target of "the Serbian authorities" was supported by a statement 
attributed to Milorad Vucelic, director general of Serbian TV 
and Radio, in the 25 April issue of the Belgrade opposition 
weekly VREME: "It is not CNN, not the foreign media which made 
up all these lies about the Serbian people, but journalists from 
Belgrade who write for DANAS, OSLOBODJENJE, VREME, Studija B, TV 
Politika, BORBA.... They provide the references for the writings 
of the foreign media." The VREME article observed that "bad 
omens are accumulating. A change in the membership of the 
Association of Journalists of Serbia has been announced, and, 
like parrots, the self-appointed patriots keep repeating the 
names of the unfit media houses, demanding that `this' question 
be resolved once and for all."

<F P=106> [Article by Ivkica Bacic: "`Hot List' of War Profiteers"] </F>
  [Text] SRPSKA REC published on the front page a 
receipt from Dafiment Banka which confirms that the wife of 
Serbia's president, Mirjana Markovic, withdrew 278,000 Swiss 
francs from that bank, and a list of the ministers, reporters, 
and opposition politicians who have a "secret agreement" with 
the bank's owner. 
  Belgrade (from VJESNIK's permanent correspondent)--What was 
published in previous weeks by Belgrade's DUGA, revealing which 
of the prominent and influential Serbs withdrew foreign exchange 
deposits after the collapse of Dafiment Banka, and who "secretly 
dined" with bank owner Dafina Milanovic, receiving valuable 
gifts from her (jewelry, automobiles, foreign exchange), was all 
just a dramatic overture to the real political hurricane that 
has been raging in Serbia since Saturday, and which was caused 
by the weekly SRPSKA REC and Danica Draskovic, the wife of 
opposition leader Vuk Draskovic, and both a director and 
columnist in the newspaper. 
  The new issue of SRPSKA REC published on the title page a 
receipt from Dafiment Banka saying that the wife of the Serbian 
president, Mirjana Markovic, withdrew 278,000 Swiss francs from 
that bank, and also published receipts with the amounts 
withdrawn by Marko Milosevic (son of the Serbian president), 
Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic, former Prime Minister Nikola 
Sainovic, new customs director Mihalj Kertes, Police Minister 
Zoran Sokolovic, opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, General 
Director of Serbian Radio-Television Milorad Vucelic, that 
company's reporter Stefan Grubac, and chief editor of TV 
Politika Aleksandar Tijanic and his deputy Bogdan Tirnanic. The 
same list also includes Dragomir Draskovic, nominally the head 
of the SKPJ [expansion unknown], as well as Ljiljana 
Habjanovic-Djurovic, a DUGA reporter who is famous as the one 
who initiated the financial and political scandal known as 
"Dafimentgate." 
<H5>  Prohibitions, Pressures, Threats </H5>
  Back on Friday, an unprecedented commotion was raised over 
the first announcement of the "hot" list that SRPSKA REC would 
print the next day. First Tijanic and Vucelic refused to 
broadcast a paid television ad when they heard what that 
newspaper was bringing on the front page, and then the head of 
the POLITIKA firm Zivorad Minovic, prohibited distribution of 
the newspaper through POLITIKA's sales network, even though 
SRPSKA REC and Minovic have a signed contract on marketing. 
Later, on the only available television channel, Studio-B, 
Danica Draskovic appeared and testified about the pressures and 
threats to which she and the entire editorial staff had been 
subjected. "Tijanic told me, `Finally I will put you in jail and 
you will never get out of it. We will destroy you and that 
vermin from your newspaper," Danica Draskovic stated, recalled 
that SRPSKA REC had been banned twice before, both times when it 
wrote something about the Milosevic-Markovic couple and their 
alliance with crime. Or, as Danica Draskovic said in Sunday's 
BORBA, "It is not a case of an alliance between politics and 
crime. The same people are both politicians and gangsters. By 
day they destroy cities, engage in ethnic cleansing, rape, 
slaughter, and rob. In the evening they justify all those 
terrors by saying it is in the national interest, and at night, 
they count their war booty and transfer it abroad. The ballots 
of the ruling party and its backup parties coincide with 
Interpol warrants and the list of the International Tribunal for 
War Criminals. The Knin-Pale-Dedinje-Cyprus line is the most 
frequent European financial line," Danica Draskovic said. 
  Even though he gave exceptional publicity on his television 
station to the scandal over Dafiment, which was initiated by 
DUGA, without questioning at all the credibility of DUGA's 
facts, and praising DUGA's courage for exposing how prominent 
Serbs were robbing the people, Aleksandar Tijanic, in addition 
to threatening Danica Draskovic, hurried to accuse SRPSKA REC of 
forgery on his television station. "Danica's list is a carefully 
arranged cocktail of names of people who are either her 
political opponents or reporters who wrote in a principled 
manner about those who took the money of small depositors. She 
wants to turn a financial scandal into a political one," Tijanic 
stated. 
  Along with that very interesting observation by Tijanic, 
according to which the previous coverage was principled, and 
"Dafimentgate" was only a financial scandal until it was taken 
up by SRPSKA REC (which, by the way, cites the committee of bank 
creditors, as well as DUGA), which expanded the list of those 
who loved Dafina to the last mark, there are also Tijanic's 
words that neither he nor Bogdan Tirnanic were Dafina's 
depositors, and that he will sue Danica Draskovic for slander. 
"All those who withdrew money after the bank's collapse, 
including Danica, will end up in court, or in a 
sanatorium--Danica herself can choose. Bogdan and I will demand 
compensation in the amount that she stole from Dafina and we 
will return that money to the people. And we will send packages 
to Danica, wherever she is, in jail or a lunatic asylum," 
Tijanic announced furiously from the screen of his television 
station. 
<H5>  Panic in the Government Leadership </H5>
  How much panic seized the very leadership of the Serbian 
authorities because of SRPSKA REC's revelation that the 
Milosevic family was also very directly involved in the scandal 
is also indicated by the fact that "from the very top," Kostadin 
Pusara (head of the team for consolidation of Dafiment Banka) 
received an order to comb through immediately and publicly, 
without approval from the judicial bodies that had sole 
jurisdiction, the list of several hundred thousand of Dafina's 
depositors. The result of Pusara's instant check on Tijanic's 
television station, and on Sunday in the newspaper of the same 
name under the title "Danica Draskovic's Forgery," was expected: 
No one in Milosevic's family ever invested in that bank, nor did 
any of those cited by SRPSKA REC (Pusara made the only exception 
for DUGA reporter Ljiljana Djurovic, because, he said, "I have 
not managed to check her yet"): SRPSKA REC's receipts "are 
certainly not credible," and consequently Pusara "does not doubt 
at all that the judicial authorities will clear up that media 
hysteria over the bank," especially now that the state has 
decided that Dafiment will not go into bankruptcy, but rather 
continue operating, which "obviously does not suit certain 
profiteers." 
<H5>  Where Should the Minister of Justice Stick His Nose? </H5>
  Who is it that is not suited by discovering the truth about 
the undeniable alliance of the state and crime, not just in the 
case of Dafina Milanovic (who was in prison twice because of 
embezzlement and forgery before Dafiment), but also in the case 
of the fugitive Jezdimir Vasiljevic, and the ministerial 
scandal, never cleared up in the courts, that awkwardly 
coincided with the violent death of two directors of Jugodrvo 
(it had to do with oil, the most profitable business in a 
country under an embargo), and about the operating licenses for 
hundreds of quasi-banks and savings banks that were closed only 
after they freely robbed the people for two years, and about 
Seselj's Radicals, who were frantically persecuted during the 
election campaign and arrested on charges of crimes and war 
crimes, but all suddenly freed when Seselj threatened that he 
would also reveal certain secrets from the period of flirting 
with the Socialists? 
  That is actually not an issue for anyone. It is clear that 
Serbia could not finance the war (wars!) or survive under the 
embargo without the assistance of the mafia (domestic and 
international), which, for the needs of the state, has grabbed 
up foreign exchange, installed the black market, developed deals 
in oil, arms, and cigarettes, laundered money.... That this sort 
of question is extremely naive and inappropriate is best 
illustrated by Serbian Constitutional Court Judge Slobodan 
Vucetic, who recently stated, "If a law-governed state were born 
overnight, by some chance, the jails and border crossings would 
be too crowded," to which one can add a comment by one Belgrade 
attorney: "I don't know whether the minister of justice dares to 
stick his nose in anything but his handkerchief."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "An Example of Dangerous State </F>
Improvisation"] 
  [Text] Belgrade -- "The offer made by Slobodan Milosevic to 
Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Romania to form a union of Balkan 
states, which became known during his recent visit to Bucharest, 
is just another arbitrary act of the Serbian president and an 
example of dangerous political and state improvisation," the 
Information Council of the Serbian Renewal Movement said. The 
statement further points out that "the most dangerous aspect of 
this act is that Milosevic is actually offering a so-called 
defense union, which is really a military pact. Considering the 
international circumstances and Milosevic's personal reputation, 
the proposal will justify all the critics in the world who 
insist that a war-mongering policy predominates in Serbia. 
  Such a major move, with such far-reaching consequences, 
cannot be made by a single individual anywhere in the civilized 
world, particularly not secretly. This offer became known to the 
Serbian public through Romanian sources. Therefore, the Serbian 
Renewal Movement demands that the president of the republic, who 
created this latest scandal, pushing Serbia further into 
isolation, come before the National Assembly and explain what is 
going on.

  [Text] The occasional "minor disagreements" are 
casting a shadow over bilateral economic cooperation; Skopje 
expects more understanding; will the joint commission resolve 
the situation? 
  From our correspondent. 
  Skopje, 24 Apr--Aco Spasovski, secretary of the Macedonian 
Chamber of Commerce's Department for Economic Policy and 
Development, claims that economic cooperation between Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and 
Slovenia is proceeding without major problems, in spite of the 
measures that the Macedonian Government introduced for imports 
of goods from Slovenia. He did add that "minor disagreements" 
happen in doing business. 
  As we know, in the middle of March Macedonia introduced 
special 15-percent tax on goods imported from Slovenia. At the 
same time, it also introduced several additional measures, among 
which those requiring a mandatory certificate for all goods are 
particularly important. Macedonian importers can acquire it from 
the Slovene producer, but it has to be confirmed by the 
appropriate institution in Macedonia. If it turns out that the 
goods were not manufactured in Slovenia, the authorities can 
confiscate or destroy them. All products imported from Slovenia 
must have labels and all accompanying documentation in the 
Macedonian language, in Cyrillic. 
  Importers of Slovene goods in Macedonia have already 
calculated that because of the new measures, the goods will not 
become 15 percent more expensive, but rather at least 18 to 20 
percent, since additional customs duties also have to be added 
to the taxes introduced by the government. Aco Spasovski is not 
convinced that with all these measures Macedonia will succeed in 
reducing the trade deficit that it has in trade with Slovenia. 
That deficit reportedly amounts to $80-100 million. One could 
conclude from Aco Spasovski's statements that the Macedonians 
introduced those measures only in order to get their Slovene 
partners to abolish the requirements for certificates for 
Macedonian goods, so that Slovenia would also recognize the 
documents offered on the origin of goods, and Slovene customs 
officials would treat goods imported from Macedonia differently. 
  In vino veritas, as the ancient Romans claimed. Macedonian 
businessmen, in fact, point out that most of the deficit arose 
because of the Slovene government's protective measures against 
imports of Macedonian wine. The amounts of Macedonian wine on 
the Slovene market supposedly declined because of that. Even the 
first analyses performed in Macedonia showed that things were 
completely different. In fact, recently Macedonian and Slovene 
businessmen concluded an agreement according to which Macedonia 
was supposed to export 15 billion liters of Macedonian wine to 
Slovenia by June. It is not completely clear, however, whether 
the Macedonian goods will finally end up on the Slovene market 
or some other one. On the other hand, Macedonian merchants also 
have to accept some of the blame. The fact is that those 
merchants are raising prices uncontrollably for Slovene 
products, so that those goods are extremely expensive. Since 
people cannot buy them, large amounts of those goods remain in 
Macedonian warehouses (it is true, however, that Slovene 
producers have also not adjusted their prices to the Macedonian 
market). 
  It is interesting that the Macedonian press is mostly 
keeping 
quiet about this Macedonian-Slovene dispute, although it 
previously wrote enthusiastically about cheap medicines from 
Slovenia (which undermined the products of the domestic 
pharmaceutical industry), about expensive Slovene products that 
they were forced to import because they were not manufactured in 
Macedonia, and also about the "closed and exploitative Slovene 
market." There is hope, however, that all these problems will be 
solved soon. Specifically, a meeting of the joint commission on 
economic cooperation, proposed by Slovenia, is to be convened 
soon. The Macedonians, to be sure, expect Slovenia to be the 
first to take steps. In their opinion, Slovenia ought to take 
into account the difficult economic situation in Macedonia 
(previously that country exported 60 percent of its goods to 
Serbia, and now the border with Greece is also closed), perform 
a good analysis of the surplus in its favor, and then propose 
measures that would at least partly coordinate bilateral trade. 
Members of the Macedonian leadership even think that Macedonia 
should have certain privileges in trade with Slovenia.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomaz Bukovec: "New Aircraft for Our Armed </F>
Forces"] 
  [Excerpt] Brnik, 20 May -- A LET-410 UVP Turbolet aircraft 
bought by the Slovene Defense Ministry from the Czech Republic 
last year has been delivered. The Air Force brigade has thus 
received its fourth aircraft in a little over a month. On 27 
April the unit received three ZLIN 242 sport planes. 
  The purchase of these aircraft was agreed upon approved by 
the former defense minister. The LET-410 plane arrived in Brnik 
at 1200 on Wednesday. In addition to helicopters, the Air Force 
brigade is equipped with seven aircraft: three antiquated UTVA 
75's, three ZLIN 242's, and the new LET-410. We could not find 
out the price of the new two-engine, high-wing, light 
transport-passenger plane. However, we have learned unofficially 
that the aircraft manufacturer, Narodni Podnik of Kunovice, 
demanded about $800,000. We doubt very much that the final price 
amounted to much more than $500,000. The Czech manufacturer used 
to build these aircraft mostly for the Soviet Union and 
therefore had a surplus stock as a result of the Soviet Union's 
collapse. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In regard to recently frequented violations of the 
Macedonian-Serbian border, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
representative for Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Elizabeth Baldwin stated for the independent 
A1 television "there is no immediate war threat, but there is an 
increased activity of the Yugoslav Army in the border area and 
cases of violations of the border are frequented." As for the 
24 May incident near the November 40 observing post, she 
informed a 21-men patrol of the Yugoslav Army halted the regular 
UNPROFOR patrol (the Nordic battalion) and an argument broke 
out. The Yugoslav troops informed the road on which the 
UNPROFOR patrol was going was to be closed, thus, practically 
disconnecting the two observing posts (November 40 and November 
41) within the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. The road 
is to be closed in two weeks and this is a in fact a warning to 
UNPROFOR to withdraw from that part of the Macedonian territory. 
According to Mrs. Baldwin, UNPROFOR disagreed with the Yugoslav 
Army patrol and stated this clearly to them. UNPROFOR expects no 
essential changes in their observing and informing activities in 
this part of Macedonia in the future. 
  Meantime the paper VECER, citing several official sources, 
reports the incidents on the Macedonian-Serbian border are not 
calling for panics as such incidents happen on nearly most 
borders. The reason for these incidents is formally explained 
with no internationally verified agreement on the border, which 
can be signed only after the two states mutually recognize each 
other. Serbia still considers the border to be more of an 
administrative than a border between two states. Serbian 
authorities still use maps made on basis of measurements done 
back in 1935, i.e., when the then existing Vardar regional unit. 
[sentence as published] The same measurements were also used to 
mark the territory of the Republic of Macedonia after the 
liberation in 1945.

  [Text] Geneva,June 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic who arrived in Geneva around noon Thursday to 
attend talks on the settlement of the Bosnian crisis told the 
TANJUG correspondent that the Serbs had come to conclude peace. 
The Bosnian Serb delegation also includes Bosnian Serb Vice 
President Nikola Koljevic, Parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik 
and Foreign Minister Alkesa Buha. The Commander of the Bosnian 
Serb Army General Ratko Mladic and his associates also arrived 
with the political delegation. 
  In his statement to TANJUG Koljevic said that the proposal 
of 
U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on the 
delimitation of the territories between the warring sides is 
expected to be tabled at the talks which are scheduled to begin 
Thursday afternoon. 
  The proposed model is very similar to the one applied in the 
disengagement of the forces of Croatia and the Republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK), Koljevic explained. The buffer areas will 
perhaps be called gray areas in which peacekeepers would be 
deployed. 
  U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi, international mediators 
Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] commanders for ex-Yugoslavia and Bosnia Generals 
Bertrand de Lapresle and Michael Rose have also arrived in 
Geneva but there is still no confirmation about the arrival of 
the Bosnian Moslem delegation which is supposed to be headed by 
Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. The Croatian delegation headed 
by Kresimir Zubak has also arrived in Geneva. 
  The beginning of the conference is still uncertain due to 
the 
absence of the Moslem delegation, all the more so since the head 
of the Moslem mission in Geneva Mustafa Bjedic announced two 
hours before the talks were due to begin that the "Moslems would 
boycott the gathering because Serbs have failed to withdraw from 
the Gorazde area (Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia) as 
requested". Conference circles do not consider this to be a 
final decision yet by there is reason to fear that Silajdzic and 
his delegation will really not arrive to examine Akashi's 
ceasefire plan. 
  If a ceasefire accord is reached the Serb delegation is 
ready 
to immediately start talks on territorial delimitation. 
  Well-informed circles at the conference report about the 
possibility of the meeting on territorial delimitation, 
scheduled for June 6 and 7 in Talloires (France), being 
transferred to Geneva if the warring sides previously reach a 
ceasefire agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adrian Nastase, executive president of the </F>
Social Democracy Party of Romania and speaker of the Chamber of 
Deputies, by Ileana Lucaciu; place and date not given: "The 
Revolt of the Facts Against the Law"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  Petty Moves </H5>
  [Lucaciu] As you well know, we are too much in the habit of 
implementing the saying that "if I am going to go down the 
drain, I may as well take my neighbor along with me." Why do 
you think that this saying is so popular with us Romanians? 
  [Nastase] One could speculate at length on the meaning of 
this saying. I believe that we have not yet managed to develop 
a sentiment of solidarity around certain common interests. 
Maybe these common interests are not all that clear to us, or 
were not properly explained to us. They do not provide enough 
motivation for the public at large, the journalists, and the 
political forces. Therefore, all we are doing is resort to petty 
moves, the end result of which is zilch, meaning that they lead 
nowhere. It is a pity, since we are thus making no headway 
whatsoever. We should aim at pointing out the essential and 
remove, as much as possible, the ballast of our resentments and 
learn to appreciate true value and merit. The thing about 
dragging the neighbor down the drain along with you does not 
apply anywhere else in the world. There are political debates 
and contrary opinions in all countries, but things are much too 
personal in our country. In Romania, the parties are 
personalized and they mainly appear before the public through 
their leaders, not their structures. Because of this 
personalization, the overall political life is too personalized, 
as well. Only to the extent that the parties become more solid 
will they be able to function better as organized entities and 
will we manage to put an end to this individualistic dimension 
and extreme personalization of Romanian political life. 
  [Lucaciu] Is it worth getting involved in politics, so that 
one may be judged severely by the public at large at some point 
for all that one has done? 
  [Nastase] Anyone entering the political life is actually 
entering a stage, whereby all your details can assume greater 
proportions due to the assorted stage-lighting. Some of the 
people backstage can throw a certain light upon you in order to 
emphasize a given detail. All this is inevitable. 
  [Lucaciu] So, whoever enters the political battle must 
assume the risks of the trade. 
  [Nastase] I would not say that it is not natural to attack 
political figures. However, I believe that a balance should be 
struck between one's political activities and one's private life 
when passing judgment on a politician. The politicians also 
have parents, families, and children. Flinging mud at people is 
unacceptable in the private sphere. Therefore, many politicians 
have begun to withdraw from politics and enter the business 
world, where they can make more money. I believe that a certain 
degree of understanding should be reached and certain practical 
limits be agreed upon as far as politician hunting can go. Even 
hunting animals has its own rules. For instance, you may not 
shoot at a pheasant on the ground or at a rabbit that is 
standing still. You may not fire more than two shots. These 
are a few rules that are supposed to give the adversary a 
chance. For instance, if a newspaper with a certain circulation 
aims at starting a hunt for politicians, it can cause such an 
upset that it might affect the entire political life. 
  [Lucaciu] Does that mean that you favor a press law? 
  [Nastase] No, because I do not believe that a law can solve 
this problem. I believe in correlating one's rights with one's 
responsibilities. I do not know how one can achieve this 
practically. Many countries practice a kind of self-censorship. 
I do not think that this is possible in our country. However, 
it is obvious that journalists should display a certain degree 
of responsibility. 
<H5>  The Wall of the Electoral Result </H5>
  [Lucaciu] Let us not forget that the press -- the same as 
the economy and even politics -- is going through a tumultuous 
period of transition. Do you believe that, in this period of 
transition, Romania is experiencing a political crisis? 
  [Nastase] There are several aspects to this question. First 
of all, we must clarify the meaning of crisis. Does it mean an 
extreme institutional malfunction? Does it mean a breaking 
point that requires other solutions than the usual ones? 
Paradoxically, the functioning of Romanian society and its 
stability have not experienced dramatic upheavals as of 
September 1991. No dramatic elements have appeared at the 
domestic level since. Therefore, the political life in our 
country has proceeded without major malfunctions for the past 
three years. I am not sure that we are in a situation of 
crisis. We are in a state of constant searches, political 
struggles, and attempts to find better or worse answers to the 
current problems. We are trying to adjust the current 
aspirations to the electoral results of 1992. As a matter of 
fact, we are faced in parliament with the electoral choice of 
1992. This is rightfully called "the revolt of the facts 
against the law." A certain codification of the electoral 
options took place in 1992, after which all kinds of political 
developments occurred, all of which bumped into this wall of the 
electoral result. This wall, created in 1992, can resist until 
1996, when the next elections are scheduled, or it can 
disintegrate under the pressure of the accumulation of facts, 
expectations, and aspirations. 
  [Lucaciu] Dismantling this wall before 1966 would imply 
early elections. Do you believe in the possibility of holding 
early elections? 
  [Nastase] I do not believe in it. However, I can tell you 
that, theoretically speaking, if the 1992 situation can no 
longer contend with the current political reality at all, then 
early elections might take place. We have not reached this 
point yet and the major political parties in Romania are not 
interested in early elections. The stability we have had since 
1991 has been achieved on the basis of a delicate balancing act 
that has required extraordinary efforts. 
  [Lucaciu] The latest public opinion polls show that the same 
electorate from 1992 no longer trusts the people it has elected. 
In my opinion, the credibility of the parliament and government 
has decreased to an alarming level. Does that not mean that we 
are in a time of political crisis? 
  [Nastase] Public opinion polls in most countries show a lack 
of trust in the respective parliaments and governments. 
Therefore, I would not take these results in our country as 
unequivocal. What is more, no matter what parliament or 
government functioned in Romania at this time, the discontent 
would still be present. You should also note the level of trust 
in the political parties represented in parliament. One cannot 
make a direct correlation between the lack of trust in 
parliament and the lack of trust in the political parties. In 
the last instance, we are faced here with a state of expectancy. 
The parliament -- not as a political institution, but as a 
legislative institution -- is called upon to do more. 
  [Lucaciu] Before last summer's National Conference of the 
Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], you issued an open 
letter through which you managed to trigger off an epistolary 
dialogue, out of the desire to clarify the doctrine situation of 
the party. In my opinion, things have not yet been clarified -- 
proof of which is the denigration campaign against you, a 
campaign that you yourself have said may not be alien to the 
doings of some of your party colleagues. Why did this situation 
arise? 
  [Nastase] Compared to the situation last summer, when it was 
not very clear how the party members were contemplating their 
ideology and action strategy, the situation has changed. The 
National Conference has helped quite a lot to emphasize a 
theoretical development and modern tackling of the 
social-democratic doctrine, which increasingly more party 
members have adhered to in recent months. I believe that, right 
now, the great majority of the party members are following this 
line and are making efforts to build a modern center-left party 
that is European in its approach to problems and national in its 
approach to interests and values. Of course, there are also 
some people who are probably afraid of changes. I do not know 
whether personal interests are necessarily at stake there. 
However, they might be afraid of the unknown... 
  [Lucaciu] Looking at the rather diverse attitudes of some 
PDSR parliamentarians at times, one may note that they are much 
closer, from a doctrine viewpoint, to the PDSR's satellite 
parties -- the Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Socialist Party 
of Labor [PSM], and the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] -- 
than to social democracy. 
  [Nastase] The answer is yes and no. Maybe this aspect was 
more obvious at the beginning. However, with the passage of 
time, we explained to everybody that we must clearly delimit 
ourselves from the other parties and I believe that this was 
pretty well understood. The problem is more of a practical 
nature. The voters can only give their vote to a single party, 
which can be the PDSR, the PRM, or another one. There can be no 
amorphous structure. There might be some common interests and 
strategies. But in the last instance, we must clearly know what 
the boundaries of our party are. Regarding the labelling the 
people as categorically belonging to a certain sphere or not, I 
believe that things have changed a lot since last year. It is 
necessary to make a much more careful analysis of the party 
structures, including at the regional level. In my opinion, many 
people have moved toward a position of expecting and desiring 
the modernization of this party. 
  [Lucaciu] I am looking now at a note published in CURIERUL 
NATIONAL daily, which prints excerpts from an interview granted 
by PDSR Spokesman Dumitru Paslaru to the BBC. I am going to 
read a sentence from it, which I would like to comment on: "We 
are dealing here with an attack against a political leader who 
has managed to make a name for himself and to elevate the party 
and make it stronger than it should have been." What might be 
the meaning of "stronger than it should have been"? 
  [Nastase] I think Mr. Paslaru placed the emphasis on the 
wrong word. He wanted to say "stronger than others would have 
liked it to be." Since I know him well, I am convinced that 
this is what he wanted his comment to be. But then, it is 
pretty hard for anyone to comment on everything that has 
happened of late. He wanted to express his support, but he also 
lacked enough information, hence he found it hard to give an 
explanation. The most shocking thing about these attacks 
against me is that they did not take place in 1990, 1991, or 
1992, but now. Why did they come when I was away on a visit to 
Germany? First, I was accused of having four houses, then of 
having only one house, then no house at all, since I had given 
it away as a present. These things are pretty strange and the 
question is: Why did it all happen at this time? 
  [Lucaciu] Nevertheless, what explanation do you have for 
the fact that this concentric fire is aimed only at you? 
  [Nastase] For the time being, I have adopted a wait-and-see 
attitude. The skeptical philosophers of antiquity used to say 
that when you have no answer to a question, the best solution is 
to suspend judgment on the question for a while. This is 
exactly what I am doing now. What is more, my position is very 
clear and, in the coming days, I will submit all relevant acts 
on the issue of the houses to the relevant parliamentary 
commission -- since it takes some time to collect all documents 
-- and then I will continue with my other, more important, 
activities. This week, we will resume our visits to the 
provinces. I no longer intend to continue my game with the 
daily ADEVARUL [which has published allegations about Nastase 
illicitly acquiring several houses in Bucharest]. I consider it 
beneath my dignity. 
  [Lucaciu] [PUNR President] Funar's party is one of the 
PDSR's allies. Do you believe that the PUNR is involved in the 
Caritas [Cluj-based money-multiplying Ponzi-scheme] affair? 
  [Nastase] I do not intend to investigate this matter, since 
I do not have the necessary details. I did not see the file. 
From the very beginning, I considered the Caritas game as a 
damaging phenomenon for Romanian society. I made this statement 
some time ago, when I first visited Cluj. At the same time, I 
pointed out why I and the party I represent cannot agree with 
Caritas and with its way of making money. 
  [Lucaciu] Why did you not start a legislative initiative at 
the time to curb Caritas and other such allegedly "mutual 
assistance" games? 
  [Nastase] The word was out at the time -- and maybe there 
was some justification to it -- that Caritas was just waiting 
for an excuse not to have to pay out the money it promised and 
to also have somebody else to blame for it. A legislative 
initiative at that time would have encouraged the Caritas people 
to claim that the initiative had destroyed the people's trust in 
the scheme, therefore the PDSR or the government should pay the 
people whose turn it was to receive money. My statements -- at 
least in the Caritas case -- were unequivocal. I said that the 
people should be warned about the risks of playing the Caritas 
game. Regarding the PUNR position vis- a-vis Caritas, I believe 
that they should clarify this matter themselves. When we held 
our talks with the PUNR, one of the first explanations we 
demanded from them was whether they are involved in the Caritas 
scheme or not. Their official answer was a categorical "no." 
  [Lucaciu] What do you have to say about Mr. Gheorghe Funar's 
participation alongside [Caritas director] Ioan Stoica in a 
television program? 
  [Nastase] I did not see that broadcast, but many references 
were made to it. We were told that the program was shot in 
different studios... I do not remember their explanations very 
well. However, the PUNR's position was that they are not 
involved in the Caritas scheme. If there are documents that 
prove their involvement, it is obvious that the matter should be 
discussed by us, by taking the proof into account. 
<H5>  Good PDSR and Bad PDSR </H5>
  [Lucaciu] The PDSR has negotiated not only with the PUNR, 
but also with the opposition. What conclusion did you reach at 
the end of these negotiations? 
  [Nastase] The discussions were halted for the duration of 
the budget discussion in parliament, without an "armistice" or 
an "end to hostilities" being declared. The budget itself 
represented a political struggle, and each side gathered its big 
guns to make their point. No serious talks can be held at such 
a time, and consequently the negotiations will be resumed after 
the budget is finalized. The conclusion of the talks is that 
each political force in the country needs to mature itself from 
a political viewpoint. This dialogue should become a means of 
communication even in delicate situations. Otherwise, blockages 
may emerge, with irreparable results through their recurrent 
effects. We have achieved a very important thing, namely a 
personal dialogue, which is more than we had in 1991 and 1992. 
We have gained a lot from that. It is the difference between 
"means" and "results." Of course, no major or spectacular 
result was obtained. Some people thought that another 
governmental team and a new parliamentary majority would be put 
together after two rounds of negotiations. Certain political 
parties expected such a thing. But the discussions revealed 
that changing the parliamentary majority is no easy thing to do. 
One cannot ignore the fact that we are working in 1994 with a 
parliament elected in 1992. These results cannot be changed 
easily. 
  [Lucaciu] Let us call things by their name. The opposition 
is demanding that the PDSR should distance itself from the PSM, 
the PRM, the PUNR, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania 
[PDAR], with which you make up the current coalition. 
  [Nastase] I do not deny that the opposition is demanding 
this. They consider this aspect to be very important. However, 
there is a matter of a nuance here. We are asked not to 
distance ourselves, but to politically separate ourselves from 
them. We are also the recipients of other advice as well, namely 
that the good part of the PDSR should join the opposition and 
the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] to 
make up the difference from 47 percent to 51 percent. However, 
let me assure you that we are not interested in having our party 
toe somebody else's line. Of course, from the opposition's 
viewpoint this would be a most useful and appealing formula. If 
they can get the 51 percent, they would have no further 
problems. They would like to take 4 or 5 percent from the 
"good" PDSR, to add to their percentage. We do not want to turn 
ourselves into an insignificant minority part of another 
governmental formula or parliamentary majority formula. Until 
now, the opposition has failed to convince us that what it is 
suggesting is also to our benefit. To put it bluntly, the offer 
is interesting for the opposition, but I do not see how it can 
be interesting for us, too. 
  [Lucaciu] You are talking about good and bad parts of the 
party. If the PDSR ceases to be a ruling party, meaning that it 
is no longer in power, will it not go the way of the former 
National Salvation Front [FSN] and split? 
  [Nastase] I do not think so. Maybe a couple of people will 
leave, but their place will be taken by others. There will 
always be an ebb-and-flow movement in the party, as is the case 
with others parties, too. The PDSR has already acquired its own 
physiognomy and can overcome even an internal crisis. Some 
people rely too much on what you just said, and they are very 
wrong. I only believe in the need to bring about a change 
within the party, minute by minute and day by day. This is what 
is actually happening, but it is not all that visible. I have 
noted this change in the territory. There are valuable people 
who want to join the party. The PDSR is like a snowman, which 
we are building and which is turning from a hastily put together 
dwarf into a big snowman. 
  [Lucaciu] May I remind you that snowmen eventually melt? 
  [Nastase] The observation is very correct. I should better 
say "like a man made of clay or precious metals." 
<H5>  The Restoration in Attitudes </H5>
  [Lucaciu] The fact that the PDSR tried to impose its people 
at all administration levels and in the executive, like the 
Romanian Communist Party [PCR] did in its time, has led to the 
conclusion that a restoration is taking place in Romania. 
  [Nastase] I do not know, it seems that many ministries have 
always functioned with their own apparatus. Whether they 
functioned well or not, well, this is debatable. These people, 
which form a separate structure, have functioned under the Petre 
Roman, Theodor Stolojan, and Nicolae Vacaroiu governments. 
There is a good and bad aspect to this situation. The teams 
will change with the passage of time. The great majority of 
these clerks were not hired now; most of them have worked in 
these ministries since 1989. I repeat, I do not know whether 
this is good or bad. Where the basic apparatus of an 
institution was destroyed, an implosion usually occurred. An 
example of this is Bulgaria, where the foreign minister sacked 
half of the employees -- if not more of them -- with the end 
result being that the respective ministry practically collapsed. 
Such things happened in our country, too. I do not know what 
you mean by restoration. If you mean that we must not agree 
that those people who held positions at a certain hierarchical 
level on the country's technical and political scale before 1989 
should hold even higher governmental positions now, well, this 
is certainly something worth discussing. 
  [Lucaciu] What is your opinion about the fact that a high 
clerk in the Ministry of Culture, the poet Ion Gheorghe, can 
claim that "the moment of 22 December 1989 is a crime against 
the Romanian people?" His presence in the ministry is proof of 
the phenomenon of restoration. 
  [Nastase] I agree that we can talk about a restoration in 
attitudes, but not about somebody's appointment to a given post. 
I agree with your assessment of the poet Ion Gheorghe's 
comments. Such a statement is inadmissible! 
  [Lucaciu] Such statements, as well as those made by other 
people still longing for the Ceausescu [Nicolae Ceausescu, 
former communist ruler] era, are pretty worrisome. 
  [Nastase] That is why we must continue to pay great 
attention to the manifestation of such attitudes and ensure that 
our society is perceived by everyone as a society that is worth 
living in. 
  [Lucaciu] But you see, there are such nostalgia-stricken 
people even within the PDSR. 
  [Nastase] I do not know who you are referring to. 
  [Lucaciu] I am referring to the articles signed by Messrs. 
Vacaru [PDSR vice president Vasile Vacaru] and Dumitrascu 
[Gheorghe Dumitrascu, PDSR senator for Constanta] in Adrian 
Paunescu's [PSM vice president] daily VREMEA on 26 January, 
Ceausescu's birthday anniversary. 
  [Nastase] I do not know whether all these articles should be 
taken literally... 
  [Lucaciu] In one of [Supreme Court Judge] Antonie 
Iorgovan's letters, which fueled the polemical dialogue in the 
press, he maintains that the country's president should not 
belong to any political party and should be independent... 
  [Nastase] This is a formula that I do not understand very 
well. In his opinion, a country's president should be someone 
held in a kind of test tube, so as not to be contaminated by 
political ideas. If that is the case, then we may one day have 
to bring somebody from abroad who has had no contact whatsoever 
with Romanian political life and is completely neutral. If we 
bring him from the East, it is bad, and if we bring him from the 
West, it is also bad. Maybe we should bring him from another 
planet. In my opinion, Iorgovan's proposal is naive. Nowhere 
is the president accepted and voted for by the entire 
electorate. Some presidents are elected by 51 percent of the 
votes, others by 55 percent. Look at the Americans or the 
French! After the elections, they become the presidents of all 
the voters! Everything depends on the ability of the 
politicians to realize their duties at a given time, otherwise 
they will eventually be held accountable for their failure. If 
a president takes someone's side too much, he will be punished 
for it. He or the party he represents will surely be punished at 
the following elections. We must realize that the current 
institutional construction in Romania becomes validated with the 
passage of time. Both the parliamentarians and their parties 
will be voted for at the next elections to the extent that they 
have performed adequately. 
  [Lucaciu] This is also the PDSR's case. Mr. President Ion 
Iliescu has started on his road with your party. Therefore, you 
will jointly reap the fruit of your achievements and failures, 
proceeding from the assumption that you will also jointly 
contest the next elections. The law on everything being 
sanctioned by the passage of time will also apply to the 
PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu tandem. 
  [Nastase] Formally, if the president wants, he will be 
endorsed by the PDSR. He can also run as an independent, but I 
believe that he will accept to be supported by us and probably 
by other parties, too. Everybody knows that he was the first 
president of this party, which proposed him for the position of 
the country's president. Therefore, it only seems natural to me 
that, six years from now, when he is no longer the country's 
president, he should return to the PDSR. This happens in all 
countries in the world. This president-party relationship is not 
something abnormal. 
  [Lucaciu] In his capacity as the country's president, Mr. 
Ion Iliescu should be neutral from a political viewpoint, as the 
Constitution stipulates. However, due to his sentimental 
nature, he does not forget you and often holds consultations 
with the PDSR. 
  [Nastase] At the party level, Mr.Ion Iliescu holds 
consultations with us, to the extent that he has consultations 
with other parties, too. Occasionally, we also want to meet 
with him and he kindly accepts it. However, please note that 
Mr. Ion Iliescu meets with politicians from all parties. His 
agenda is proof of the fact that he often has such meetings. 
  [Lucaciu] A recent PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu meeting took place 
at Cotroceni, with the "Nastase case" on the agenda. 
  [Nastase] Four subjects were discussed at that meeting. The 
press campaign against me was not a distinct subject of 
discussion. Of course, this element was brought up at a certain 
point. However, the matters of interest for our Central 
Executive Bureau meeting were those linked to the basic problems 
of our political life. 
  [Lucaciu] Still, what did Mr. Ion Iliescu have to say about 
this campaign against you? 
  [Nastase] My opinion is that some people thought that my 
relationship with the president is too good and it should be 
destroyed, so as to hurt me and, I think, also him. Of course, 
much speculation can be made in this respect. As far as I am 
concerned, I looked back in time and could find no moment of 
tension between President Iliescu and myself. On the contrary, 
we have always understood each other very well. I have always 
told him what I thought, and I believe that this helped him to 
take certain decisions. I consider Mr. Ion Iliescu to be a 
political figure who has made a great impact on our political 
life in the past five years and who will continue to play an 
important role. 
  [Lucaciu] Have you ever thought of running for the position 
of Romania's president? 
  [Nastase] To be honest, I have never thought of this, for 
quite a few reasons. First, I do no think of a problem when it 
does not arise. Right now, we have a president, new elections 
are going to be held two years from now, and I think that 
President Ion Iliescu should consider running again for a new 
mandate. I am 44 years old and I do not think that a country's 
president should be that young. I do not know whether I would 
be ready for such a position. I lack the necessary experience, 
since I have only been politically active for the past five 
years, which is far too little. As a matter of fact, the issue 
of the presidency is slightly exaggerated in our country, since 
we attach too much importance to the position of president. Of 
course, this comes from our past and from the idea that we need 
a fatherly figure. If you read the constitutional stipulations 
about the president's prerogatives, you will note that they are 
rather limited in Romania. They mainly refer to his capacity to 
influence. Thus, I assure you that the life of a foreign 
minister can be far more interesting than the life of a 
country's president, which should not be envied. Therefore, I 
have not bothered to think of the problem raised by your 
question. 

<H5>    Some People Were Scared by the Public Opinion Polls </H5>
  [Lucaciu] I asked you that question because a recent pubic 
opinion poll showed you to be the most popular political figure. 
  [Nastase] The polls change from one week to another, if they 
are correct at all. Personally, I do not pay too much attention 
to these polls, but others seems to have attached great 
importance to them, got scared for reasons I fail to comprehend, 
and then leaked all kinds of messages and interpretations, some 
of which found their way to a certain newspaper [ADEVARUL]... 
  [Lucaciu] You stand for change and modernization in 
politics. What about the family life? How do you see the 
husband-wife relationship in your rather large family? Are you 
still subscribing to the old principle that the wife should stay 
at home, care for the children, and wait for the husband with 
the meals ready? 
  [Nastase] My wife is a very practical and dynamic woman. I 
humbly admit that I would have liked my wife to stay at home. 
On the other hand, I cannot ignore the fact that, if I were to 
stick to such an old mentality, I would practically risk 
destroying my family. I cannot ask my wife to wait for me at 
home with a hot meal from early in the morning until 11-12 at 
night, when I come home after work. I admit that I would like 
that, but I am rational enough to realize that if she did not 
have something to do and all she had to do was read the papers 
that attack me, then she would begin to suffer from anxiety. 
That is why I encouraged her to find a job for herself. She is 
working on a project now. Maybe she will publish it, I do not 
know... The truth is that, these days, a woman can no longer 
stay at home as in the past. We, men, should also change our 
mentality. I am making efforts to change my attitude, but I 
admit it is pretty hard. 
  [Lucaciu] I hope you will not be angry with me if I ask you 
where the nickname "Sweetie" comes from? I heard it from some 
of your PDSR colleagues. 
  [Nastase] This nickname does not even bother me. I believe 
I was given this nickname because I am slower by nature, softer 
in the way I express myself, pretty easy-going, and with round, 
less sharp features. Maybe this is the source of it all. It is 
only natural that I should also have a nickname, since almost 
every politician has one. I find it hard to judge whether this 
nickname suits me or not. After you also wrote a lot about my 
nickname, people said that I am authoritarian, tough, and 
inflexible. I do not know how these statements tally with the 
nickname of "Sweetie." Maybe those who claimed all those things 
did it too hastily. 
  [Lucaciu] At the beginning of your parliamentary mandate, I 
believe that the nickname suited you, since you were chairing 
the sessions far too delicately. Then, when you were faced with 
the hardships of tumultuous parliamentary life, you let go of 
the little bell and started making use of the alarm gong and so 
forth. 
  [Nastase] I believe that we cannot make any headway in our 
parliament without a little firmness in chairing a session. The 
deputies have also begun to accept that the session chairman 
should play a more dynamic role. At times, someone is needed to 
break the deadlock, by putting together certain ideas in order 
to reach a compromise. Otherwise, hours on end would be wasted, 
without any results being achieved. 
  [Lucaciu] Is compromise a specific method in politics? 
  [Nastase] Compromise is absolutely necessary, it is the 
essential way in which many political problems can be solved. 
Compromise is the key answer to any political dispute. Of 
course, basic principles of values must not be affected, but a 
balance of interests should always be achieved. 
  [Lucaciu] What disturbs you most at this time? 
  [Nastase] The fact that I am in politics and that I must 
keep on going. What I have just said -- that sometimes I feel 
like retiring from politics -- is something that preoccupies 
many politicians. I -- as well as my wife and parents -- am 
also asking myself, quiet often, whether it is worth it to stay 
on in politics or devote myself more to my family. Those close 
to me suffer along with me for the attacks in various articles, 
and I know how ill- meaning they are. But then, I must probably 
have a sentiment of duty... I do not know whether this is good 
or bad... I inherited this attitude from my father, namely that 
I should not desert something when the going gets tough... 
Nevertheless, the question remains whether it is worthwhile 
staying in politics or not?! Many people are asking themselves 
this question today...

  [Text] Shortly before noon Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard 
Kukan and Russian Ambassador Sergey Yastrzhembskiy signed an 
agreement between the Government of the Slovak Republic and the 
Government of the Russian Federation on conditions for visa-free 
travel by citizens of the two states. Maria Mikusova has just 
returned from the Hotel Borik where the signing took place. 
  [Mikusova] This is the 27th agreement signed by Slovakia and 
Russia since the formation of an independent Slovakia and the 
first of its kind between Russia and one of the Visegrad Four 
countries. The existing arrangement of mutual relations in the 
sphere of travel created extensive possibilities for differences 
of interpretation and various bureaucratic measures. The 
signing of this agreement provides for the introduction of very 
precise and clear rules. In the words of Ambassador 
Yastrzhembskiy, it is a special agreement because it concerns 
people who are interested in visiting our country. 
  As for what the significance of this agreement was for 
Slovakia, I asked Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan: 
  [Begin recording] [Kukan] The agreement on visa-free travel 
which we signed with Ambassador Yastrzhembskiy has the principal 
significance of regulating travel and visits by Russian citizens 
here and our citizens to the Russian Federation. In terms of 
objective conditions it is not a classic agreement on visa-free 
travel such as we have with certain other European countries, 
but I think it will play a positive role in the current 
situation in our mutual relations and that it will have a 
positive effect on the future. It also documents our interest 
in expanding relations with the Russian Federation in such a way 
that would be beneficial to both sides. 
  [Mikusova] Minister, will this agreement guarantee that such 
elements as we would not wish to see here will not get onto our 
territory? 
  [Kukan] Yes. I answer yes unequivocally and without 
hesitation. That is why we signed it. [end recording] 
  Let me only add that the agreement will come into effect 
following joint ratification.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" from Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus's address at </F>
the Tufts University Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy 
graduation ceremony in Boston on 22 May 1994: "A New Conflict 
of Ideas"] 
  [Text] In our country and our part of the world, we bear 
witness to and enthusiastically participate in the end of 
communism and the beginning of a new era, the beginning of a 
free society. When I refer to the end of communism, I feel 
obligated to warn against often oversimplified views and 
interpretations, and against incorrect and misleading 
expectations which are -- paradoxically -- two completely 
different trends. 
  Communism was an immense human tragedy but I can agree 
neither to its demonizing on the one hand nor to its 
trivializing on the other hand. The demonization of communism 
implicitly suggests that communism was a unique, unrepeatable 
event that somehow befell its innocent victims, without any 
fault on their part, without their silent approval, or their 
active cooperation. That is not true. Communism was "only" a 
more extreme form of etatism, human constructivism, and 
political and social engineering; a world where somebody knows 
better than the others what is best for all of us, where one and 
only one interpretation of freedom, right, social equality, or 
economic rationality is considered obligatory. Communism also is 
a world of extreme bureaucracy, far too many directives and 
bans, human oppression and human degradation, a world of 
powerlessness of the citizens against the omnipotent state. 
  I dare to argue that a milder form of all these symptoms 
exists also in the standard Western societies. In the course of 
history, the development of these symptoms had its ascents and 
returns, and it also had its dangerous internal dynamics, thanks 
to which a point was unexpectedly reached when the entire 
society slid into an unforeseen and unintended state of affairs. 
Therefore, I believe it is extremely important also for the 
Western countries to know the maximum about our experience and 
study it very carefully. 
  I dare say that the Czech Republic is undergoing the fastest 
and most successful systemic changes in the entire postcommunist 
world. We have already formed a standard system of ideologically 
well-defined political parties. We have been successful in 
reaching and maintaining the basic political and social accord 
with respect to goals, strategy, and running results of the 
transformation. We have introduced a market economy based on a 
massive and unprecedented privatization, deregulation, and 
liberalization, as well as on a high degree of macroeconomic 
stability. 
  We have accepted in our country an open view of society, 
which is based on the trust in human action rather than human 
design, if we are to use the very helpful terminology of 
Friedrich von Hayek. Nevertheless, during the transition period, 
it is necessary to assign even the state a considerable 
constructive role. The reformers must abolish the old 
institutions, and the ensuing institutional vacuum must be 
quickly filled with an alternative coordination mechanism. 
Otherwise, the new system would not work. The faster, broader, 
and deeper this transformation runs, the lower is the economic 
and social cost, and the more successful is the entire systemic 
change. 
  I disagree with the opinion that the world has entered the 
stage occasionally referred to as the end of history or the end 
of ideology. Neither is, and never will be, true. As long as 
people are people, there will be ideological conflicts. The 
conflict between communism and free society dominated the world 
in the past decades, and the current conflicts are not any less 
significant. We are -- after decades of life under communism -- 
somewhat oversensitive in this respect, and consider it our duty 
to warn against these invisible, or insufficiently conspicuous 
potential dangers. 
  The present world also bears witness to another fundamental 
conflict. It is again becoming a question whether to trust 
unlimited teamwork and cooperation of free citizens or rather 
delegate power to the hands of benevolent politicians and 
administrators; whether we are convinced of the superiority of 
the "free market" system, or prefer the "just" market (which 
means protectionism); whether we are satisfied with monitoring 
the quality of production of our industry, or whether we want to 
control production technology and processes; whether we advocate 
the free market, or a state industrial policy; whether we favor 
the free choice based on our own preferences and interests, or 
whether we accept aprioristic externally formulated norms and 
criteria. 
  This idea is based on the ethically peculiar and rationally 
unsustainable argument that different labor costs from firm to 
firm or country to country cause a "distortion of competition" 
and that such a lapse must be remedied by enlightened 
supranational regulation. Calls for quasi-universal social 
rights are a disguised attempt at protecting high-cost producers 
in the countries with a high degree of regulation and with 
unsustainable welfare standards from cheaper labor in less 
productive countries. The disparity that arose between the 
North and East (or South) is not a result of the difference in 
regulation or social legislation but directly reflects the 
difference in the productivity of labor. Postcommunist and 
developing countries cannot raise wages above their productivity 
and no international conference can increase their productivity. 
Their unemployment rate and general poverty can increase, 
however, if these external criteria and standards are imposed 
upon them. 
  The conflict of ideas prevails, and we must discuss it. I 
hope that the fundamental liberal demand for freedom of speech 
will never be replaced by the non-liberal slogan about the 
"correctness of phrases," with this correctness defined, perhaps 
with good intentions, by the advocates of this or that truth.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, today received Vitaliy Churkin, special 
envoy to the Russian president for Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 
talks were attended by Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Churkin 
expressed interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina's stands regarding the 
cease-fire with the Serbian aggressor and the possible 
participation of a Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation at the 
negotiations on the political solution to the crisis. 
  Izetbegovic informed Churkin of the positions he had also 
presented to the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Russian 
envoy said that he expected Serbs to withdraw from the Gorazde 
protected zone, something that Izetbegovic had set as a 
condition for negotiations to continue. The Bosnian side has no 
objections to the Serbian population remaining in the Gorazde 
region, but only if the people involved are those who had lived 
on the said territory before the war. It is known that the 
Serbian aggressor forces are trying to colonize the Gorazde 
region, which was also pointed out to [words indistinct].

  [Text] Zagreb, June 1 (TANJUG) -- Russian special envoy to 
the former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin said after talks with 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman in Zagreb that Knin-Zagreb 
talks were likely to resume soon and that the deadlock would be 
broken. After the signing of a ceasefire agreement, this would 
be a significant move forward in the process of normalizing the 
Knin-Zagreb relations, he said. As for the venue of the talks, 
he said he believed a place acceptable to both sides would be 
found. 
  The agreement on cessation of hostilities and troop 
pull-out, 
reached in late March between the republic of Serb Krajina (RSK) 
and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb, took effect in 
early April. The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 by local Serbs in 
their ancestral land within Croatia in response to Croatia's 
forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation and its 
attempt to downgrade the Serbs to a national minority. The 
territory was placed under U.N. protection in March 1992. 
  In a statement to the press, Churkin said that all sides 
were 
preparing for a resumption of talks on a ceasefire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are scheduled to open in Geneva on 
Monday [6 June]. He described the situation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as complex, stressing as important that all 
sides should attend the talks and warning that this was also a 
duty to the international community in the process of reaching a 
ceasefire agreement. He added that this could be the first step 
towards implementing the programme adopted in Geneva by the 
European Union, Russian and U.S. foreign ministers. He said 
that all preparations were completed and added that now the time 
was right for resolving the crisis. He also pointed out 
Moscow's engagement in seeking a solution for the entire 
territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  Churkin on Tuesday visited Belgrade, where he conferred with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, RSK President Milan Martic 
and senior officials of the Bosnian Serb republic. After 
Zagreb, Churkin on Wednesday leaves for Sarajevo, where he is 
scheduled to meet with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic 
and probably with Kresimir Zubak, the president of the Bosnian 
Muslim-Croat federation.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek by Nikola </F>
Sostaric; place and date not given: "Being a Slovene Is Too 
Little"] 
  [Text] The signing of the agreement on wage policy 
will automatically regulate pensions as well; the next biggest 
challenge is to reduce interest rates; let's wait for Italy to 
gain a government; the president would be satisfied if the 
present coalition remained; when you invent a culprit. 
  We spoke with Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek just one 
hour after he finally signed the wage policy agreement and thus 
also formally concluded the social pact that his government had 
been advocating ever since its inauguration. The first question 
is therefore understandable: 
  [Sostaric] What are the guarantees that the documents you 
have signed will also be carried out? 
  [Drnovsek] The signatures themselves are a considerable 
guarantee that they will be carried out. Furthermore, the trade 
unions and the Chamber of Commerce agree that the government 
will ensure instruments for implementing those agreements, and 
the law can also be such an instrument. 
<H5>  Pensions Also Regulated </H5>
  [Sostaric] Are pensions the next challenge now? Retirees are 
protesting against any sort of changes, since they do not want 
to give up the relatively favorable position that they have now. 
  [Drnovsek] There is always a lot of fuss over pensions. We 
in 
the government are constantly under pressure from assessments by 
economists that pensions consume relatively too large a part of 
the social product. That is a burden on the economy, which is 
also consequently not competitive enough. With the retirees' 
protests, however, it is necessary to find some middle course. 
That is why I also think now that it is necessary to withdraw 
the interventionary law, study once again what has been 
proposed, and settle it in agreement with the retirees. We have 
submitted a bill to amend the law for legislative proceedings, 
and it is to be adopted through normal proceedings, which makes 
it possible for us to verify it with the retirees. They want 
changes in pensions to be coordinated with changes in wages. Now 
we can withdraw that interventionary law, because the social 
agreement on wage policy will contribute to bearable changes in 
wages, and thus pensions should not deviate from that either. 
Assuming that we have regulated wages, we can claim that we have 
also regulated pensions. 
  [Sostaric] Wages have been regulated, but what is the next 
challenge? 
  [Drnovsek] I hope that with the social agreement we have at 
least reduced the tension, if we have not yet eliminated it. 
That should ensure social peace. Now it is time for the final 
adoption of the budget by the State Assembly, which should 
happen in May. 
  The procedure for adoption of the budget has been going on 
for more than half a year now, which in my opinion is extremely 
irrational, although the State Assembly's rules of procedure 
specify that procedure. We are now actually adopting the budget 
at least twice. The adjustments are very dramatic, and then we 
have to start it all over again. Normal countries adopt budgets 
once; they are coordinated and adopted. In our case as well the 
process should be simplified and shortened. 
  I hope, however, that we will adopt the budget next week, 
after all the possible adjustments. The government insisted on 
the original figures offered; there were only minimal 
deviations, which are not fundamental. If that kind of budget is 
adopted, it will be quite rational and frugal, the most that we 
can afford now. 
<H5>  Reducing Interest Further </H5>
  [Sostaric] We adopt a budget every year, and we are 
interested in all sorts of other more long-term economic policy 
issues that would have to be resolved. 
  [Drnovsek] Recently economic trends have been favorable, 
production has kept growing, and inflation is still declining, 
since the average monthly inflation during the first three 
months was 1.3 percent, which means annual inflation between 15 
and 18 percent, and perhaps we will achieve another percent or 
so less. Unemployment has also started to decline, and if we 
also add to that the encouraging foreign trade trends, we can 
say that the economic results are encouraging. 
  With the new budget, we will regulate the total level of 
public and budgetary spending, but in any case interest rates 
are one of the fundamental issues of economic policy. The 
government has already achieved something in that area, and with 
the measures coordinated with the Bank of Slovenia, there has 
been a partial reduction in interest rates. They are still too 
high, however. I expect that we will also reduce them somewhat 
further during the coming period. That can be achieved primarily 
by monetary policy measures, because it is within the purview of 
the Bank of Slovenia, and on the other hand, the finance 
minister can influence the interbank interest rate primarily by 
loaning out and guiding state money. 
  [Sostaric] But the chronic shortage of money in general 
affects the level of interest rates. 
  [Drnovsek] And also the incomplete rehabilitation of the 
banking system. It is taking place, to be sure, but it is not 
yet finished and consequently loopholes from the past are still 
influencing interest rates. We will review bank rehabilitation 
once again and try to determine what else can be done. 
  [Sostaric] Dr. Mencinger, however, thinks that last year 
Slovenia showed successes because of mistakes in economic 
policy. You yourself, at a meeting of the government's economic 
council, stated that some economists were advising you to 
restrict wages, and others to free them. With such different 
opinions, what is the truth? 
  [Drnovsek] The opinions are very different. When we froze 
wages last year, everyone criticized us, including economists, 
and then the same people complained that the freeze did not last 
longer. It is a really delicate area, and that is why I am glad 
that we reached an agreement. If it goes into effect as we 
agreed, it will undoubtedly be better than a law freezing wages. 
If that agreement is in effect over the long term, it will be 
extremely important for the economy, since it is very difficult 
for us to adjust public spending, pensions, and wages. The 
government itself has very limited instruments to do so. 
  [Sostaric] We expect a great deal from privatization, but it 
is proceeding more slowly now than we anticipated. Will the 
government speed it up? 
  [Drnovsek] We are speeding it up as much as we can. We are 
monitoring the activity of the Privatization Agency, and we are 
trying to help solve the problems. In any case, I think that 
privatization is taking place rather intensively. A lot of 
programs have already been approved, and I think that there are 
two reasons for the delays: the audits done by the SDK [Public 
Auditing Service], since many enterprises have applied, and the 
SDK has a limited number of trained personnel. The rest of the 
delays are due to the denationalization proceedings, which 
hinder enterprises from more rapid privatization. At any rate, 
we will try to speed up the proceedings even more and make them 
more efficient, but we do not anticipate any general changes in 
the privatization process. 
  [Sostaric] There are two options in denationalization: 
restoration of the nationalized property through compensation, 
or the return of that property in kind. What is your position? 
  [Drnovsek] We have to act in accordance with the valid law, 
which also allows returning it in kind. Many people consider 
that a controversial solution, which other countries do not 
have, but our parliament passed the law a while ago. Changing 
that law would also be extremely sensitive politically. We 
therefore did not try to undertake it, and we as a government 
are trying to do everything possible within the framework of 
that law. At any rate, that law contains the brakes on the 
privatization process. 
<H5>  The Fatal Year 2001? </H5>
  [Sostaric] Slovenia is a country that has to join the world. 
If we look at the free trade zone agreements and Slovenia's 
intention of joining the European Union, we note that 2001 will 
be the year when the protective barriers to foreign competition 
will fall to the minimum. In just seven years, therefore, the 
Slovene economy will have to prepare for full foreign 
competition. Isn't that too soon? 
  [Drnovsek] We have already had to adjust quickly to very 
difficult conditions. The shock that our economy experienced 
after independence and the loss of its markets was much worse 
than the further adjustment to world competition and developed 
Europe will be. It is true that after independence we had many 
bankruptcies, and that the number of people unemployed grew 
drastically, but at the same time, what happened strengthened 
the enterprises that survived, and that means that they will 
also continue to endure. I think that we will adjust to the new 
requirements, and the present relatively liberal policy that is 
trying to open Slovenia up as much as possible is also 
contributing to that. 
  [Sostaric] In a way, Slovenia's future position in Europe 
will also be decided by our group negotiating with the European 
Union. Do we have enough competent experts for Slovenia, as a 
future member of the European Union, to secure the best possible 
starting position? 
  [Drnovsek] There are never enough experts, and we are short 
of them as well. In any case, we will have to obtain them, since 
joining Europe is a serious issue. All our legislation, 
standards, and other regulations will have to be adapted to the 
European Union, which will be extremely extensive work. Of 
course, we are counting on the cooperation of experts from the 
European Union. Sometimes it seems that we have many experts on 
everything else, on beating a dead horse, but there is a 
shortage of them when serious work has to be done. 
<H5>  Caught Between the Great Powers </H5>
  [Sostaric] That has probably also been shown by the 
negotiations with GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], 
when we were quite optimistic, but to this very day we are not 
yet members of that organization. 
  [Drnovsek] As far as GATT is concerned, I still think that 
we 
will succeed in becoming a member by the end of the year, before 
the establishment of the World Trade Organization, in which we 
could become founding members. The reason why it has not 
happened yet is that we were caught between the interests of the 
United States and the European Union. In their trade war, both 
of them are putting pressure on little countries like Slovenia, 
which have to adjust to one side or the other. If we come closer 
to the European Union and its regulations and standards, the 
Americans make problems for us, and vice versa. We are in the 
middle, and we are trying to get out of it. 
  [Sostaric] With all of this, the issue of Slovenia's 
promotion abroad has been raised for a long time. The fact is 
that we are doing a poor job of promoting Slovenia, and to the 
best of our knowledge, some government office ought to take over 
that business. 
  [Drnovsek] A lot is said about promotions, and everyone 
would 
like to be involved in them, so that sometimes the problem is 
how to coordinate various promoters or various ministries. That 
is why there is a proposal in progress for the establishment of 
some body that will coordinate those responsible for promotions 
and make them more efficient. 
<H5>  Relations With Neighbors </H5>
  [Sostaric] The Foreign Ministry has issued an analytical 
document that talks about how we are in a semi-colonial position 
with respect to Austria. The question that arises is whether 
Slovenia, in regulating its economic relations with Austria, 
will wait for the latter to become a member of the European 
Union, or seek a different path to regulate mutual relations? 
  [Drnovsek] Slovenia does not have any sort of semi-colonial 
relationship with Austria. We have good-neighborly relations 
with Austria, and a completely independent policy. Austria will 
probably become a member of the European Union in a very short 
time, and we consequently have to count on it primarily as a 
member of the European Union and measure our subsequent steps in 
accordance with that fact. So far we really have sought 
possibilities for cooperation within the framework of EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association], but the fact is that all the 
Scandinavian countries and Austria are going into the European 
Union, and consequently EFTA no longer interests them. To be 
sure, we are still trying to keep EFTA involved, but it is 
obvious that a relationship with the European Union is greatly 
preferable. 
  [Sostaric] There have been significant political changes in 
Italy. It may happen that relations between Italy and Slovenia 
will not be pleasant. Is Slovenia as a country prepared for 
those changes? 
  [Drnovsek] What Italy's actual policy will be like has yet 
to 
be seen. To be sure, there is a great deal of shouting now, 
there is still no government, and this is consequently a sort of 
transition period, which should not be perceived as appropriate 
for judging Italian policy toward Slovenia. When a government is 
put together and it has to try to solve problems constructively, 
I can hardly imagine that Italy will resort to a different 
policy than the usual one in the European Union, since Italy 
itself would therefore end up in serious difficulties within the 
European Union, and Europe also would not tolerate it, 
especially if there came to be such an aggressive Italian policy 
that it would threaten Italy's neighbors. It is something that 
is unacceptable by European standards. 
  If it does happen, we will have problems, of course, but in 
that case Italy will also have difficulties with democratic 
Europe, and therefore we will not be isolated in defending our 
interests. We are now just waiting for Italian policy to settle 
down somehow and start to function normally. 
  [Sostaric] What about the present Istrian campaign for some 
sort of union of the Croatian, Slovene, and Italian 
municipalities in Istria? 
  [Drnovsek] We do not intend to change the state system. 
<H5>  Normal With Croatia </H5>
  [Sostaric] As far as Croatia is concerned, the data indicate 
that bilateral trade is declining every month, and political 
relations themselves are stagnating. 
  [Drnovsek] Trade is declining with all the former Yugoslav 
republics, including Macedonia. In Croatia's case, that trend 
has existed since the end of the free trade relations between 
the two countries. In any case, this February we achieved 
progress in our mutual relations, when we signed several 
agreements with Croatia, so now I can say that relations are 
normal. Obviously there is also less and less tension in the 
media, and the fact is that Croatia has other problems that it 
has to solve. There are a few individual issues that are 
hindering more rapid clarification of our mutual relations. In 
addition to the problem of the borders, which is slowly being 
solved by the joint commission, we also have the issue of 
Ljubljanska Banka in Zagreb, which is a serious problem in our 
mutual relations, and the issue of the nuclear power plant. We 
are talking with the Croats about those issues and preparing 
solutions. We have already proposed some of them, and we have 
yet to propose others, so I hope for progress if we maintain the 
present level of bilateral relations. 
  [Sostaric] Of course, the Slovene economic delegation's 
visit 
to Bosnia-Herzegovina showed that Slovenia is still interested 
in economic cooperation with the southern republics. 
  [Drnovsek] Enterprises and the economy are always interested 
in business deals. If there is a market there that they can work 
with, Slovene enterprises will cooperate in it just like all 
other foreign enterprises. Of course, because of their 
familiarity with that market our enterprises have some 
advantages, and thus when the situation settles down there will 
be normal bilateral economic relations. 
  [Sostaric] Even with Serbia? 
  [Drnovsek] When the sanctions are lifted, when the 
international community normalizes relations with Serbia, 
Slovenia will do so as well. 
<H5>  I Support the Status Quo </H5>
  [Sostaric] A question about the coalition--the present big 
coalition of three parties is now functioning fairly well, but 
there is talk about a new coalition of the LDS [Liberal 
Democratic Party] and the SKD [Slovene Christian Democrats]. 
  [Drnovsek] The coalition is functioning, and the agreements 
that I have with both the partners, the SKD and the United List, 
are in effect; the LDS is prepared to continue working in that 
coalition, since it now has enough parliamentary support to 
guarantee the operation of the state, the government, and the 
whole system. As long as it works, we will try to keep the 
trilateral coalition. The problem is that the SKD no longer 
wants to cooperate with the ZL [United List] in the government, 
and thus the two other partners cannot manage with each other. 
  The LDS's position is that it is no longer possible to act 
within a trilateral coalition, we will have to decide and 
determine which bilateral coalition and possibly which group of 
deputies could allow establishing a stable government. At this 
time that still does not mean an a priori decision in favor of 
one party or the other, but rather a thorough study of the 
situation and then a very firm agreement with the coalition 
partner. The government needs strong parliamentary support, so 
that by the end of our term we can carry out everything that we 
planned at the start. 
  That is why I am not in a hurry to change the coalition. The 
pressure will come from elsewhere, and we have yet to see when 
and how we will reach an agreement. 
  [Sostaric] Nevertheless, if that trilateral coalition 
actually does collapse now, no alliance would have a majority: 
You need the help of the small parties in parliament. Which 
ones? Perhaps Jelincic's? 
  [Drnovsek] That is still an open question. We still have 
democrats here who have not joined the LDS, and are still 
independent deputies. Thus, in both options, either with the 
Christian Democrats or the United List, we could achieve the 
necessary majority in parliament. 
  [Sostaric] You would obviously prefer the status quo? 
  [Drnovsek] From the standpoint of consolidating the state, 
that would be best. 
<H5>  Most Progress Last Year </H5>
  [Sostaric] It was recently determined that Slovenia's 
standing in the world had declined. 
  [Drnovsek] According to the latest international 
assessments, 
it has risen. The last such assessment comes from the 
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTOR magazine, which is highly esteemed in the 
banking world. It thought that Slovenia was last year's winner. 
Of all the countries in the world, it made the most progress in 
one year. On the scale of the top 10 winners of the year, 
Slovenia is in first place according to the criteria of which 
country, according to a world standard, gained the most in one 
year. At all sorts of international meetings and at 
institutions, Slovenia is receiving good assessments, and in a 
way we are being treated like a country that has succeeded 
considerably faster than the world expected. I must say that 
Slovenia is viewed considerably better abroad than it is at home. 
  [Sostaric] In spite of that pleasant circumstance, we are 
having difficulties over the unallocated Yugoslav debts, and 
there are problems with succession. 
  [Drnovsek] We are still negotiating with a consortium of 
banks about the debts. There will be more negotiations again 
soon. It is hard to predict the outcome of the negotiations, 
since we are negotiating quite hard, but we will try to settle 
the matter. It is important for us, since that is precisely what 
is keeping us down in the international ratings; the "Yugo risk" 
is still in our financial credit rating. I am a moderate 
optimist about this, in spite of our domestic financial 
disagreements, which have also politicized that issue. 
  Actually we are now making use of the domestic tension over 
the foreign debt, which some people brought to light as--I don't 
know--some sort of discovery, although we have all known about 
it for 10 years now. We are telling our credit partners, the 
commercial banks, that we also have populist policies that 
present matters in radical terms. We are thus trying to induce 
them to accept our proposals and not some subsequent 
alternatives that would seriously hurt them and Slovenia. 
Fortunately our negotiating partners are not interested in 
anything like that, since they would obviously put a solution of 
the problem off until the future. 
  [Sostaric] In view of what has been said, is the story about 
Slovenia as a winner still relevant? 
  [Drnovsek] For anyone who is familiar with the situation and 
knows the kind of circumstances with which Slovenia had to cope, 
what it means to lose 40 percent of the markets overnight, as 
Slovenia did, and had to compensate for them during a period of 
world recession, and at the same time carry out changes in the 
economic system at home, all without outside financial 
assistance, our achievements are convincingly good. 
  That is not understood by those who are not familiar with 
world realities, who think that it is enough that you are a 
Slovene and then everything will work out by itself, and that 
just changing the signs and the name of the country is enough 
and then everything will be better--those who do not know that 
you have to win everything yourself, that in this world one has 
to survive a very hard struggle. People have to know that. 
  [Sostaric] Then the so-called UDBA [State Security 
Administration] mafia is not to blame for everything? 
  [Drnovsek] We witnessed such phenomena after World War I, 
when the economy, objectively, collapsed. At that time people 
also invented a culprit who was to blame for everything and 
exploited others, who therefore lived poorly. At that time it 
was the Jews. That is an extreme example, of course, but it is a 
good illustration of where that sort of simplification and 
demagogy can lead.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Zoran Petrov: "A Necessary Evil With State </F>
Support"] 
  [Text] Every change brings danger and risk. That is the 
reason why it must be emphasized internal incertitude is 
characteristic of the so-called societies in transition. The 
reason for such a prognosis is simple -- in such states, the 
most-radical and, in many senses, most-sensitive change comes 
about, which is in the titular ownership of the social capital, 
which was in the hands of the state in the former socialist 
countries. The bright side of the coin of privatization is the 
establishment of the market economy, when sound competition has 
to be the leading factor in the overall economic progress of the 
country. When we speak about sound competition, we will allow 
ourselves a small digression in the terminological explanation. 
Competition (this comes from Latin, meaning contest, rivalry) 
is carried out through supply and demand and the game of prices 
on one hand, and the action of the competition forms the market 
prices of the goods, following the law on the value of goods 
production, on the other hand. 
  However, the transformation of the social capital, the 
famous 
"privatization," can and has to be viewed as a necessary evil 
that must be overcome with as few tremors as possible. 
Otherwise, the transformation itself would be transformed into 
a general theft that would leave nothing of the state. In such 
circumstances, "sound competition" becomes unimaginable, and 
"Madame Mafia," organized criminal, comes onto the scene. 
<H5>  Awakening in Darkness </H5>
  Recent Interior Ministry information shows that the 
increasing number of acts of committing or concealing criminal 
acts causing great damage was characteristic of the last year, 
as was the receiving and giving of bribes, causing the 
appearance of a more serious dilemma on the surface. According 
to the information, this kind of detected criminal act, compared 
to 1992 and 1993, has increased 107 percent. The figure itself 
-- no matter how hard we try to view it as a conditional 
correlation -- points to an alarming situation. In order to 
avoid the dilemmas -- it is a fact that Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], compared to most 
post-communist countries or societies in transition, is 
maintaining a high level of security, which should not and must 
not make us self-satisfied. Particularly not when we talk about 
the economic crime that is increasing in the country. 
  On the other hand, when we talk about the phenomena of 
"bribery" and "corruption," we must stress that they represent 
the more difficult forms of economic crime. In keeping with the 
way they transpire (most frequently they are done in private, or 
through various mediators), they are at the bottom of the list 
of proven cases. In other words, the so-called "black" figure 
of unrevealed criminal acts is the greatest in this area. As a 
matter of fact, there is an opinion that the criminal sphere in 
which bribery and corruption belong, the least revealed, is 
practically the most widespread in reality. Therefore, it 
exists, but due to its character, the difficulty of revealing 
and proving it, the absence of a practical strategy for its 
detection by state organs, it remains in the dark, that is in 
the unrevealed crime range. 
  If we go back to the introductory views on the high risk of 
privatization, with the presumption that the dominance of social 
ownership is still reality in Macedonia, on the eve of its own 
metamorphosis into private or some other kind of ownership, we 
indubitably come to the conclusion that the social property is 
the most threatened at this moment. The remolding of the social 
capital into private capital reveals numerous hitherto-unknown 
forms of economic crime. On the other hand, the methods are 
classical -- abuses, bribery, and corruption. Almost overnight, 
like mushrooms after rain, new businessmen are appearing -- 
owners of private or mixed companies who, at the expense of 
everybody's or nobody's social ownership, at the expense of the 
sleeping and disorganized state, and primarily all at the 
expense of the workers who are rapidly approaching the edge of 
bare subsistence, make their wealth very quickly. 
<H5>  The Robbery of the Century Continues </H5>
  As a matter of fact, it is a public secret and a regular 
subject of discussion among the common citizens, among those 
with a salary or pension of around 100 to 200 German marks a 
month, that the state is being robbed blind. For the time 
being, there are neither answers nor reactions from those bodies 
and services that are there to protect the state. There are no 
replies from the legislative or executive bodies that had to 
enact and implement the legal basis for preventing the 
state-damaging and dangerous events. The most logical 
conclusion is that such a situation suits all, particularly 
those in power. Except, of course, for the citizen whose bare 
existence is put at stake. Thus, the reaction of the common 
people is reduced to ordinary gossip about the state or the 
ruling power, which, regardless, is continually becoming a 
self-serving power. In order not to make this sound like a 
radical trade unionist dirge about the difficult fate of the 
working people, we shall stick only to the aspect that, 
according to the competent state institutions and their 
associates, is, especially now, demonstrating such indolence and 
indifference, which makes the whole matter look like an 
introduction to a kind of totalitarianism. 
  Parallel to all this, what seen be noticed in Macedonia with 
open eyes, conveys to image that the state let go of the reins a 
long time ago. It has not just released them, but it is showing 
less interest and strength in taking control. It can be seen 
that individuals are making money overnight, that taxes are 
being avoided, that deals are mostly made in "cash" in order to 
avoid the financial institutions, that some companies have the 
exclusive right to import and export, given to them for their 
beauty (confidentially), that speculative liquidations are 
taking place, that the social capital is being sold off for next 
to nothing.... 
  In such a situation, the rapid polarization of the citizens 
is evident, as well as the growing public discontent with the 
striking examples of abuse, machination, and speculation, which 
finally leads to a certain institutionalization of the crime. 
  Claims that the state authority bodies are not involved in 
such filthy deals are fairy tales. In brief, no matter how 
painful it may be, the ancient scheme of connecting the economic 
power with the political power is slowly emerging in the 
Republic of Macedonia. This also creates the conditions for the 
revival of the connection between the criminal climate and the 
state establishment, which represents a basic definition of the 
phenomenon -- organized crime.

<F P=106> ["Omonoia Implements the Project of the Greek Government </F>
Against Albania" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 30 (ATA) -- On May 29, the newspaper 
REPUBLIKA published the letter that the chairman of the General 
Council of the Omonoia organisation in Albania, Sotir Qiriazati, 
sent on April 8, 1994 to Mr. Constantine Mitsotakis, ex-premier 
of Greece. Follows the letter: 
  The General Council of Omonoia, the organisation 
representing 
the Greek minority in Albania, deems it necessary to thank you, 
personally, the Greek Government and whole Greek people, for the 
all round and constant support for the Hellenization of the long 
suffering North Epirus. On this occasion, Mr. Premier, let us 
decide and express some of our opinions on general problems 
preoccupying the Hellenization of North Epirus and on whose 
solution depends further development. 
  Firstly: The present international conditions, I believe, 
allow the North Epirus problem, too, to appear on the 
international arena. We are confident that the government of the 
motherland will exploit all the existing possibilities to 
resolve this national question. 
  Secondly, our organisation, since the first moment of its 
functioning, has assumed as its main objective the revival of 
the Hellenism living in Albania as well national, religious, 
spiritual, cultural, economic and social development, because in 
this way Hellenism is believed not only to stay in its own 
hearth but also to recover and flourish obviously. 
  But, our zeal, toil, and efforts do not suffice to attain 
this significant objective. We also need the support and love 
of our motherland, a programmed political, economic, moral 
assistance as well as the Greek Government aid. 
  Concretely: 
  1. It is necessary that Omonoia be gradually organised into 
a small undeclared government with the corresponding services 
based on the Greek ministries with employees, offices, and a 
budget, as the conditions prevailing in Albania enable it to 
exercise the policy and carry out the duty of governing in the 
North Epirus land. In case this objective is realised, we 
gradually create predispositions for the autonomy of the region, 
make it evident and develop as an internal national political, 
cultural, economic and running force at home. In order to move 
ahead in this direction, we necessitate experience and special 
advice as well as considerable amounts of money. 
  2. Coordination of efforts is necessary and every ministry 
of the Greek Government should designate counsellors competent 
for Albania's Hellenization, give orientations, supervise the 
correct application of the governmental policy and coordinate 
this government's accord. An equal extension for all the bodies 
with leading and executive powers is an indispensable demand for 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  3. It is the sole and insisting demand of this country and 
people to have a free communication with the homeland, it is a 
measure which was successful before the war and for the special 
value and conditions created it will have magnificent results 
for all the question of North Epirus because it: 
  a. Will bring the people closer to the final solution 
through its national and psychological spirit: 
  b. Will economically bring about a rapid improvement of the 
standard of living of the people and later their continuous 
staying in their homes: 
  c. Will lead to non-abandonment of their homes by our people 
who have been forced to install their families in Greece because 
they will be given the possibility to legally bring their 
families back whenever they want and whenever it is needed: 
  d. It will stop the phenomenon of refugees and reprisals 
among North Epirus people who are forced to pass illegally and 
secretly the border between the two countries and become 
refugees hunted on the streets and villages of Greece, or 
arrested by Greek relevant bodies. Tortured, humiliated, and 
hopeless they are forced to be back to Albania. 
  4. A necessary and primary condition for the salvation and 
survival of the Greek minority in Albania is the rapid 
development of this region through all sided investments and "a 
unique program of development of the economy of Epirus" until 
the other side, too, wins. You, Mr. Premier, have expressed 
this idea during your latest visit to the border point of 
Kakavije. 
  Thus, fast investments, both private and state, and the 
valuation of fruitful economic sources and the labour force of 
the people of this region are necessary. We should also stress 
the importance that the spheres of agriculture, industry, 
communication, telecommunication, improvement of roads, 
construction of hospitals, education and culture have for the 
development of our country. For optimal conditions, these 
spheres demand fast and efficient involvement of the Greek state. 
  5. Another question to be considered with responsibility and 
seriousness, a question that should be solved by the Greek 
state, Greek universities, and scientific organizations is the 
opposition to the systematic anti-Greek propaganda which through 
a political, spiritual, and economic devotion has been spread 
throughout Albania and in the foreign world with the technical 
creation of the "Cam question" and the falsification of the 
history of Epirus. 
  It is still necessary that the Greek mass media (television, 
radio and press) must give an oral reply to Albanian liars and 
falsifiers, pseudo-scientists and through a high responsibility 
they should address the Greek minority and North Epirus in 
general in their programs and news bulletins. 
  6. Finally there is a need of strengthening essentially the 
exarch of the Orthodox Church of Albania, the honoured 
Anastasios Janullatos, to be able to carry out his as difficult 
as precious job for our national interests. 
  Assured of having your continuous support on our way, Mr. 
Premier, we thank you and again wish you good health and 
strength for the success of our most important and national work 
that you are leading.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Presidency of the Patriotic Political </F>
Association Cameria" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- The ominous letter the 
chairman of the Omonoia organisation, Sotir Qiriazati, sent, on 
behalf of the organisation's General Council, to the ex-premier, 
Costantinos Mitsotakis, and which was published on May 29 in the 
Albanian mass media, has caused a deep indignation among the Cam 
martyred population, whose wounds caused by the Greek chauvinism 
have not yet been healed and which will be repeated by Qiriazati 
and tools like him at the expense of the generous and noble 
Albanian people. 
  Since the first days of the creation of the Cameria 
Association, in its program we have supported the right for 
prosperity of the Greek minority in Albania, thinking that only 
in this way can the two minorities, the Greek minority and that 
of the Albanians of Cameria, as pillars of the same bridge of 
the Albanian-Greek friendship, be respected and enjoy the rights 
they deserve. But, unfortunately, until now we have observed no 
such sign of good will and humane clearness on the part of the 
representatives of the Greek minority in Albania. We want to 
remind the rebels and those following them that the "Cam 
question" is not a theoretic invention or a technique of 
Albanian political parties, as stated by the ominous letter of 
Omonoia's General Council, but an act practically realised by 
the blackest Greek chauvinism, which expelled us from our 
millenary hearths through genocide. 
  "The Cam question" is one of the most unprecedented 
tragedies 
committed by those who today boast of "the most ancient 
democracy" in the world, and which Qirie [Mr.] Qirizati wants to 
bargain over. Also, on this occasion, we want to remind all 
those who consider our question as illegitimate that the 
martyred population of Cameria is determined on its way to 
finding a solution and winning the rights denied to it, not in 
the way pursued by the present chiefs of the Greek minority in 
Albania, but guided by the world human principles. Finally, we 
want to remind all those who see daydreams that Cameria, the 
land of our predecessors, is the South Epirus, inhabited by us 
since the ancient times.

  [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- Eduard Selami, chairman of 
the DP [Democratic Party], delivered a press conference on the 
main results of the elections for the local government in five 
zones of Albania. Mr. Selami declared that DP has won 66.4 
percent against 18 percent of the previous elections, in 
Greshice 67.7 percent against 17 percent against of the previous 
elections, in Gracan 66 percent, in Rec of Diber, the DP won 
55.7 percent of votes, while in Zallherr of Tirana they will 
hold a second round of elections. Tritan Shehu, DP secretary 
general, and Ali Spahia, DP deputy chairman, were also present 
in the press conference. 
  The DP, declared Mr. Selami, has made significant progress 
in 
these elections, while the SP is marking decreases. The 
comparison of the results is the best proof of the elections. 
The votes which the electors cast for the DP candidates will 
encourage the DP to implement strictly its program. Mr. Selami 
said that the program of the democratic government is one of the 
most successful of Eastern Europe. 
  The elections of the May 29th were the best answer for those 
political forces, which have had the new elections their 
political motto since March 1992. Mr. Selami considered the 
victory of his party as very important also for the continuation 
of the reform. The success has also been a result of the 
realistic campaign conducted by DP, it had in an open dialogue 
with the people. 
  Referring to the SP [Socialist Party] press conference on 
May 
29 and its declaration, Mr. Selami said the facts revealed in it 
are not true. "I have stated," said Selami, "even before the 
results of the elections that if there is any violation of 
rules, competent bodies will adopt the necessary measures." Mr. 
Selami said that for violations noticed in two zones, 
responsibility should fall on the electoral commissions, whose 
chairmen were members of the SP and not of the DP, and 
unfortunately they have created conditions for 
mis-interpretations and tensions. 
  Mr. Selami considered the focusing of the attention on the 
Nano question as a factor which has influenced in the loss of 
SP. He said that in all the meetings he had had with people of 
the remotest communes, he had never been asked about Nano case. 
The SP conducted its electoral campaign to defend Nano, which 
according to Selami, was a question which made them aim at a 
wrong target. 
  Answering the questions how he considered the lower results 
of the SP, Mr. Selami said that SP policy has been a tensional 
and nihilistic one, which served those who are in trial, 
mentioning here the case of misinformation by the socialist 
press and also the cases of insults and offense towards the 
leaders of DP. 
  Asked about the non-participation of DA [Democratic 
Alliance] 
in the elections, Mr. Selami said that DA happened to be in the 
Albanian political life due to the stolen mandate of DP. While 
on the insignificant victory of the other political parties, the 
DP leader said that Albania will continue to have for a certain 
period of time the system of two big parties, while the other 
parties will have it difficult to find their way.

  [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- At today's proceedings of 
the People's Assembly, the speaker, Pjeter Arbnori, told 
deputies to vote the draft law for some changes of the Law on 
the State Budget of the 1994 and after it to discuss the draft 
law on the Advocates Office in the Republic of Albania. But, 
Mr. Arbnori said that he was giving the floor to the chairman of 
the SP [Socialist Party] parliamentary group, Namik Dokle, who 
has requested to read a statement. 
  Mr. Dokle said in his statement that "whatever might be the 
result of the local government elections in the Libofshe 
commune, the Socialist Party declares it as unsupportable 
because there have been irregularities during the elections, 
violence, buying of the votes, manipulations, ill-treatment of 
the SP members in the election's commission and even to the six 
SP deputies." 
  Addressing to the SP deputies, Mr. Arbnori said you should 
accept the result of the elections. At this moment, the 
deputies of the SP parliamentary group stood up creating a tense 
situation and slapping the tables started coming out of the hall. 
  In this tense situation, Mr. Arbnori gave the floor to the 
chairman of the DP [Democratic Party] parliamentary group, Ali 
Spahia. Mr. Spahia said in his statement that "we are seeing 
the continuation of the policy of destabilization and tension, 
violation of the law and confrontation of the justice by the 
Socialist Party. The Socialist Party created that tense 
situation in Libofshe. The Democratic Party held three peaceful 
meetings. The meeting of the Socialist Party was provocative 
making insulting and provocative appeals against the Democratic 
Party, and extremist and Enverist shouts such as "Long live the 
Labour Party," etc. 
  Mr. Spahia said that the Socialist Party is the offspring of 
the dictatorship but now it is not able to deceive the people. 
"During all the electoral campaign, no DP activist or supporter 
have used insulting words against any political personality or 
party or the Socialist Party, no in the special meetings nor in 
the open ones," Mr. Spahia said adding that "our messages have 
always been constructive, peaceful, and brotherly ones, having 
the thought that the elections will be won by that political 
force which is chosen by electors." 
  During all the time Mr. Spahia was speaking, the SP deputies 
continued to slap the tables and shout trying to interrupt him. 
  At this moment, Mr. Arbnori canceled the seance. After the 
break, the deputies approved the draft law for some changes on 
the Law on the State Budget of the 1994. The SP deputies did 
not vote but continued their protest.

  [Text] Tirana, June 2 (ATA) -- Prime Minister Meksi 
yesterday at the evening's plenary seance gave explanations 
about the incidents which took place during the local government 
elections in some communes. Mr. Meksi was called to the 
parliament by the SP [Socialist Party] deputies. 
  Deputy Dokle who took the floor first presented once again 
the requests and claims of his parliamentary group for the law 
violations in the electoral [passage indistinct] Prime Minister 
Meksi said he was called by the chairman of the SP Parliamentary 
Group, Namik Dokle, to give explanations about the elections 
held on May 29 in some communes. In Greshica, the door was 
broken and the lights were turned off; thus, the ballot box had 
been manipulated. According to the Socialist Party, there were 
also tumults in the Libofsh village where persons from both 
sides had been confronted. There have been SP deputies including 
Namik Dokle. As soon as the president and the government were 
informed midday on Sunday, they asked the attorney general and 
the general director of the police to send there a control group 
which asked, controlled, verified and ascertained that the 
elections were being held in a normal way. Thus, what had 
happened was outside the ballot boxes. 
  Premier Meksi emphasized that our country needs quietness 
and 
not destabilization. But when destabilization is provoked, 
those who incite seek to multiply it. There have been elections 
in 30 villages, but only in Greshica were there irregularities 
in the ballot boxes and in Libofsha outside the elections. 
Libofsha was a tense political arena even before the election. 
At the same time, I would underline that on May 28, a day 
before the elections when the electoral campaign is forbidden, 
certain persons went to Libofsha and lodged slanders and insults 
against the Democratic Party. "I would say that, in general, 
democracy requires free and quiet elections. The ballot box 
keeps the will of the people and we should learn to obey results 
of the elections."

  [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- On May 30-31, the foreign 
minister of Albania, Alfred Serreqi, met with senior officials 
of the diplomatic missions of the European Union member 
countries and Security Council member countries accredited in 
Tirana. The topic of the meetings was the latest developments 
in Albanian-Greek relations. 
  Minister Serreqi said that as opposed to Albania's 
insistence 
on resuming dialogue there is an escalation of tension by the 
Greek party which does not hesitate to use unexisting causes for 
this purpose. Mr. Serreqi said there has been no arrest among 
the Greek minority, except the six persons made known in the 
communique of the Tirana Attorney's Office. No Albanian citizen 
of Greek or Albanian origin summoned as witness has been 
arrested, and as you know, the courts are independent and 
processes open and unbiased. 
  The spread of false news as in the case of the socalled 
arrest of 31 persons from the minority and others like this, the 
minister said, intends to destroy the image of democracy in 
Albania, like in the case of the late Sh.M., who months ago died 
of heart attack, but in which case the Greek propaganda 
machinery managed to deceive the European Parliament, which 
described the case in a resolution as a person killed by the 
Albanian police. 
  Regarding Greece's blocking the European Union's economic 
assistance for the balance of payments, the Albanian Government 
says that this is a real cause to block reforms in Albania and 
destabilize the country. It also intends to lead Albania away 
from its course of integration into Europe. But, Mr. Serreqi 
said, this will meet with failure. This action also shows the 
wish to penalize the regional policy of Albania which serves 
peace and stability in the region. 
  Under these conditions, Albania asks the European Union 
member countries not to allow compromise with the course of 
reforms and not be reconciled to the aid freeze. Also, Albania 
emphasises that it is open and ready to cooperate with the 
European Union and the Security Council to overcome a tense 
situation between the two countries. Minister Serreqi said that 
Albania has been the first to ask for this assistance and 
continues to be open to it.

  [Text] Tirana, June 1 (ATA) -- The agreement on the 
PHARE-94 [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and 
Hungary] project for Albania was signed May 31 at the Ministry 
of Finance. "This ceremony left me a very strong impression," 
said Elio Germano, ambassador of the European Union in Tirana. 
With the signing of this agreement, he said, we confirmed that 
the European Union will stand side by side Albania to help it 
with the developing processes and the economic and institutional 
reform. The signing of this document implies that Albania 
should be increasingly close to a decentralised economy and 
programs projected for the Albanian people, Mr. Germano said. 
"During our stay in Albania, we have worked to conclude this 
program as soon as possible and completely, something which also 
serves the strengthening of our relations," he concluded.

  [Text] Sofia, May 30 (BTA) -- "I do not think the world 
has become a safer place now there is no Warsaw Pact. Quite the 
opposite, many analysts admit the danger for armed conflicts has 
become greater," Russian Federation Security Council Chief 
Secretary Oleg Lobov said upon his arrival at the Sofia Airport. 
Mr. Lobov is heading a Russian Government delegation on an 
official visit to this country. The delegation also includes 
the Russian Federation deputy ministers of economy, 
foreign-trade affairs, defence and finance, senior officials of 
the military-industrial complex and businessmen. 
  "While the danger for a nuclear war might be more distant 
now, we see local conventional wars breaking out just beyond the 
Russian and Bulgarian borders," the Russian guest also said. 
"We should therefore seek to stabilize the bilateral relations 
in the name of a greater world security," he also said. 
  "We hope that Bulgaria and Russia will further promote their 
bilateral contacts, and not only those in the economy but in 
culture and tourism as well," Mr. Lobov said commenting on the 
results the visit is expected to bring. This visit is aimed, 
among other things, at restoring the broken contacts between the 
two countries, the head of the Russian delegation said. He 
further specified that apart from the contacts on government 
level, the visit will focus on the direct ties between Bulgaria 
and the different administrative units and autonomous republics 
within the federation. The sides will also discuss the military 
and technical cooperation which is of particular importance for 
both countries, Mr. Lobov said.

  [Excerpt] Sofia, May 30 (BTA) -- [passage omitted] An 
acceptable solution concerning Russian supplies of armament and 
military equipment for Bulgaria in settlement of Russia's debt 
to it can be found in two months' time, Mr. Lobov told the BTA 
Daily News reporters after the meeting which the Russian 
delegation had at the Council of Ministers with a group of 
Bulgarian Government experts led by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni 
Matinchev. 
  The participants in the meeting considered mainly problems 
related to military equipment and the exchange of experience in 
the field of conversion, the Russian statesman said. The 
restoration of direct transport connections between Bulgaria and 
Russia was also discussed. The question is about the Black Sea 
ferry service from Varna, Bulgaria, to Novorossiysk, Russia, 
and, possibly, the opening of other similar services, Mr. Lobov 
stated. He believes that various goods could be shipped from 
Bulgaria to Arkhangelsk in Russia by expanding river and sea 
transport connections. 
  The Bulgarian and the Russian delegations exchanged 
information on the condition of the administrative management of 
the military industry complexes in the two countries. They 
considered the establishment of Bulgarian-Russian scientific 
organizations and industrial and commercial joint ventures in 
the defence industry sector. The sides discussed the 
possibility of Bulgaria and Russia granting each other trade 
preferences concerning taxation and customs duties. An 
agreement between the governments of Bulgaria and Russia on the 
establishment of an intergovernmental commission for cooperation 
in the defence industry is expected to be initialled tomorrow, 
BTA learned from the Council of Ministers Press Office. 
  The Russian delegation is going to visit some Bulgarian 
military plants. It will be received by President Zhelyu Zhelev 
and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov; it will have a meeting with 
Transport Minister Kiril Ermenkov too.

  [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- Russia will continue to 
adhere to its agreements with Bulgaria reached during the visit 
of President Yeltsin to this country in 1992, says a verbal 
message from President Yeltsin delivered to President Zhelev 
today during his meeting with a Russian Government delegation, 
journalists were told by the leader of the delegation Oleg 
Lobov, secretary of the Security Council of the Russian 
Federation. The delegation includes deputy ministers of 
defence, economy, finance, etc., managers of the military 
industrial complex and businessmen. Despite the difficulties in 
restoring bilateral economic ties, in 1993 commercial exchange 
between Russia and Bulgaria went up 20 percent, Mr. Yeltsin 
observed with satisfaction, the Russian guest added. President 
Zhelev was particularly interested in the prospects for setting 
up direct transport links between Russia and Bulgaria across the 
Black Sea and along Russian rivers, Mr. Lobov said. Cooperation 
between the two countries will continue as before despite the 
changed situation in the Black Sea basin which should remain a 
zone of peace, Dr. Zhelev said in a verbal message to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
  The interests of our two countries and armies dictate that 
the two states preserve their own defence industries and develop 
efficient kinds of armaments and combat equipment, Oleg Lobov 
told journalists today. During the delegation's visit to the 
Ministry of Defence today he assessed the prospects for 
bilateral cooperation in the military industrial sphere as 
optimistic. The meeting was attended by all directors of 
Bulgarian defence enterprises and the talks were quite specific 
and businesslike, a government spokesman told BTA. 
  A protocol signed today by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni 
Matinchev and Oleg Lobov covers issues of military cooperation 
and ways to upgrade transport links between Bulgaria and Russia. 
The two sides also initialled a document on the setting up of 
an intergovernmental Bulgarian-Russian Commission in the defence 
industry. A representative of the Government Press Office 
described the document as confidential. The Bulgarian side will 
be headed by Evgeni Matinchev. Eight Bulgarian-Russian joint 
ventures are already working in this field and five more are 
preparing their documentation, Oleg Lobov told journalists. He 
pointed to the importance of the eased tax and customs 
regulations these ventures enjoy under Russian legislation and 
the need to exchange experience in conversion. 
  According to Mr. Lobov, at the delegation's meeting with 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov today, the prime minister expressed 
full support for the work carried out so far and showed 
particular interest in the setting up of a system for 
transporting cargo by ferryboat along the Varna (on the Black 
Sea) to Novorossiysk (Russia) line. Additional work should be 
done on issues related to partial repayment of Russia's debt to 
Bulgaria with military equipment deliveries, Mr. Lobov added. 
Joint expert groups will work on this in the next two weeks. 
During the meeting we expressed the wish to promote joint 
construction of oil industry projects in Russia and to increase 
the number of the 12,000 Bulgarian builders in the Russian 
Federation who are doing an excellent job there, Mr. Lobov added.

  [Text] Sofia, June 1 (BTA) -- Today parliament passed at 
second reading the National Security Service Act. The National 
Security Service [NSS] (which stands for Bulgarian 
counterintelligence) was set under a 1991 act regulating the 
activity of the Interior Ministry and rescinding all previous 
legislation concerning the ministry's structures. 
  The newly passed act defines the National Security Service 
as 
a specialized counterintelligence unit of the Interior Ministry 
which is responsible for the protection of security and the 
lawful state administration against encroachment. The National 
Security Service has different sections: operations, analysis 
and planning, coordination, training and administration, 
centralized data processing, and operational documentation. 
  The National Security Service will be engaged in activities 
aimed at safeguarding this country's security and will manage, 
control and coordinate the activity of local national security 
departments with regional police directorates nationwide. 
  Under this act, the National Security Service will be 
authorized to collect data by examining facts, individuals and 
sites related to national security, to guard strategic 
activities and establishments, to clear would-be employees in 
such establishments and officials for access to material 
constituting a state secret, and to exercise border control over 
documents and vehicles. NSS officials are allowed to use 
special surveillance means in performing their duties.

  [Text] Sofia, May 31 (BTA) -- The anticommunist Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) today confirmed its boycott of 
parliament declared last week. The leaders of the coalition say 
the Constitution was violated when on May 13 parliament rejected 
the structural changes in the government moved by the prime 
minister, and the latter did not tender his resignation. 
Following a regular meeting of the leadership of the 
ex-communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), Doncho Konakchiev 
MP said he could not rule out the possibility of the Socialists 
moving a no-confidence vote in the cabinet. "It all depends on 
the cabinet's performance and meeting of commitments," he said. 
  "For the SDS it is beyond doubt the Lyuben Berov cabinet's 
staying in office violates constitutional order," SDS leader 
Filip Dimitrov told a press conference following a regular 
meeting of the SDS leadership. "The SDS decided to stand out 
against the attempt to trample on the Constitution and keep the 
government in power," he said. He said the coalition decided 
there was no reason for maintaining the status quo. The SDS 
MP's will not take part in plenary sittings. Dimitrov, however, 
said the faction will enter the debating chamber in new cases of 
violation of the Constitution. Asked if the SDS will take part 
in the passage of bankruptcy and scheme-of-arrangement laws, 
Dimitrov said decisions will be made for each individual case. 
The coalition will expand extraparliamentary activities, and 
calls rallies on the Persin Island (on the Danube) on June 4 and 
in Sofia on June 7. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and BSP floor leader Nora 
Ananieva today had a telephone conversation on parliament's 
legislative work. According to Chief BSP Press Officer Klara 
Marinova, the prime minister guaranteed he would personally take 
part in parliamentary debates on amendments to the Privatization 
Act, a BSP priority. 
  According to Konakchiev, BSP will urge parliament to discuss 
probable changes in the Constitution and a new election law 
before its summer recess. SDS leader Dimitrov said changes in 
the Constitution were a complex issue.

  [Text] Prague, June 1 (CTK) -- Forty-five percent of 
Czechs believe that parliament should consist of the Chamber of 
Deputies alone, according to a survey of 946 people carried out 
by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) at the end 
of April and the beginning of May. In November 1993 this figure 
was 42 percent, and this February it was 43 percent. 
  Meanwhile, support for a two-chamber parliament to include a 
senate is down to 18 percent, having stood at 23 percent in 
November and 24 percent in February. Those who did not know 
formed 37 percent (earlier 35 and 33 percent). 
  People who did not want a Senate were more likely to be 
Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD) supporters, although they 
included also many Civic Democratic Party (ODS) supporters. 
  The IVVM also asked respondents if they would take part in 
elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Senate and local 
authorities if such elections were to be held now. 71 percent 
said they would definitely or probably take part in Chamber of 
Deputies elections and 76 percent in local elections, but only 
45 percent would take part in elections to the Senate. 
Willingness to participate in all three types of elections grew 
with the level of education reached.

  [Text] Prague, May 31 (CTK) -- The 15-percent maximum 
difference in the population of the Senate constituencies is as 
acceptable as the 27-percent difference for the ODS (Civic 
Democratic Party), Libor Novak, an ODS deputy, told journalists 
at a press conference of the ODS Deputies Group today. 
  The elections to the Senate, the not-yet established upper 
chamber of the Czech Parliament, will take place probably in the 
autumn, along with local elections. The Senate is to have 81 
deputies, one-third of which will be alternated every two years. 
It is an "administrative" rather than political matter, Novak 
added. 
  Novak was alluding to the debate on the authenticity of the 
presented bill, in which some deputies, including those from the 
coalition parties, pointed to the fact that the government draft 
bill included 15-percent difference and was more in line with 
the equal electoral right embedded in the Constitution, while 
the bill submitted to the parliament included the 27-percent 
difference. 
  The ODS considers the order of the constituencies, whose 
list 
should be included in a supplement to the law on parliamentary 
elections, an administrative issue, Novak said. The order is 
decisive in determining in which constituencies senators will be 
elected for two, four or six years in the first senatorial 
elections. 
  However, the ODS considers the biggest possible 
"fragmentation" of the constituencies ideal because it believes 
this would help minimize cases in which senators in several 
adjacent constituencies would be elected for the same term of 
office, Novak added. 
  The ODA will support the one-round variant for the 
senatorial 
elections which is based on the principle of a relative majority 
(the British system), Novak reported. The two-round system, 
proposed by the bill, is also acceptable for the ODS, he added. 
  No ODS deputy will vote for the abolishment of the Senate, 
Novak said. However, Jiri Honajzer, chairman of the ODS 
deputies group, admitted that only about half of the ODS 
deputies supported the Senate elections.

  [Text] Budapest, 31 May (MTI) -- The Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ) has not yet been invited to coalition talks, 
and is not in the position to initiate such negotiations, SZDSZ 
Chairman Ivan Peto told MTI today. Whether the Free Democrats 
will take part in the next government, should they be invited to 
do so, will be decided by a delegates' assembly behind closed 
doors on Sunday [5 June], he said. 
  In the parliamentary elections which ended May 29, the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) won 54.15 percent of the 
mandates and the runner-up SZDSZ 18.14 percent. 
  The Free Democrats conceive the operation of a coalition 
cabinet in such a way that the parties supporting the government 
have veto power regarding the choice of ministers and other 
politicial office-holders whose appointment falls under the 
prime minister's competence, Peto said. 
  The Free Democrats press for changes in the mechanism of 
legislation. In their view, the government should involve all 
parliamentary parties, including the opposition, in the drafting 
of bills. The SZDSZ seeks to specify strict incompatibility 
rules for deputies, and reduce the extra allowances due to 
members of government, the chairman said. 
  The Free Democrats have repeatedly declared that the 
coalition government should be balanced rather than reflect the 
parties' power relations in parliament, Peto said, adding that 
the key ministerial posts should be distributed between the 
coalition parties accordingly. 
  Personal guarantees are also required for the implementation 
of the coalition's common program, Peto said. "This is not yet 
a coalition offer, only a piece of `fiction'," he added. 
  Peto also said that this week he would hold an informal 
consultation with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, the date of which 
has not yet been set.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 1 -- President Lech Walesa told PAP 
Wednesday he would run in the presidential elections scheduled 
for the autumn of 1995. "It is for the first time that I 
confirm it publicly," the president said. "I was encouraged to 
fight again, especially by the postcommunists and all those 
attacking me," he said in an exclusive interview for PAP. 
Speaking about his possible electoral platform, Walesa referred 
to the programme he had promoted in the last presidential 
elections and said: "We must review the programme we have had 
until now and draw up a new one, using the experience of the 
past four years." 
  Walesa said he hoped his electorate would include all people 
of honest work. "I do have many achievements to my credit and 
although some have been forgotten I am convinced that not one of 
the figures on the political scene can match my record," Walesa 
claimed. He said he planned to draw up a complete list of his 
accomplishments and have it published. 
  Asked about his political base in the elections, Walesa did 
not exclude this role would be played by the Non-Party Reform 
Bloc (BBWR), an organization created on his initiative shortly 
before the September, 1993 parliamentary elections. He left 
open the possibility that a new presidential political party 
would be created. 
  The president said he was glad there were already 
politicians 
in the political arena planning to contest the presidential 
election, but added he was not afraid of rivals. "I will prove 
I still have many fresh ideas that no politician can beat," 
Walesa assured. He announced he would not support any grouping 
in the forthcoming local government elections. 
  The president reiterated his position that the chief of the 
Polish army general staff should report to the president, not 
the minister of defense. He also once again declared he would 
not sign into law the amendments to the law on abortion now 
debated by the Sejm. 
  Walesa gave good marks to the cabinet of Waldemar Pawlak, 
but 
remarked that the bulk of really tough decisions had been made 
by the previous four cabinets. "The present government is in a 
convenient situation and this accounts for its successes so 
far," said Walesa. "However, we shall only see what the future 
will bring..." 
  Walesa categorically denied information concerning his sons 
carried by the latest issue of the POLITYKA weekly and putting 
in doubt his conduct as a father. "I will say bluntly: those 
who cannot fight me through other means are now trying to do it 
via my family life," the president declared.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 1 -- Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
emphasised Poland's need and desire for greater economic 
cooperation with Japan on Wednesday. Speaking after his meeting 
with the chairman of the Japan-Poland Economic Committee, 
Toshikuni Yahiro, he said that "Poland's good economic results 
will contribute to ensuring that it is based on partnership and 
will be beneficial to both sides." 
  Pawlak emphasised that Polish-Japanese trade was increasing. 
He recalled the important speech of Eijiro Hato, Japan's 
minister for international trade and industry, concerning the 
readiness of the Japanese Government to remove the barriers to 
short term trade loan and long term investment loan guarantees 
for Poland. 
  Toshikuni Yahiro said that the fifteenth session of the 
Polish-Japanese economic committees which had taken place after 
an almost four year break had opened up a new stage in 
cooperation between the two countries. He added that on his 
return to Japan he would urge his government to increase 
economic contacts with Poland. 
  Toshikuni Yahiro said that 1994 was a good year for 
strengthening economic links since Japan was beginning to 
recover from a three year recession and Poland had the best 
ecnomic results of all the central and east European countries.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu offered an official dinner on Monday, 30 May, 
evening in honor of Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who 
is paying a state visit to Romania. 
  In his toast, the Romanian president said that the talks he 
had the pleasure to have with the Indian head of state had 
permitted an examination of the basic aspects of the bilateral 
relations and especially the recognition of the main directions 
and ways of developing and deepening the Romanian-Indian 
collaboration in all fields of mutual interest. 
  President Iliescu expressed his confidence that the 
concluded 
agreements, synthetically expressed by the Declaration on 
Principles and Directions of Cooperation and by other documents 
that were going to be signed, would open a new chapter of the 
bilateral relations. 
  The Romanian president said that Romania was attaching a 
particular importance to the achievement of substantial 
progresses in the field of the commercial exchanges and economic 
cooperation. 
  The Romanian Government expresses its readiness to establish 
the inter-governmental juridical frame able to encourage actions 
of mutual interest between Romanian and Indian companies, said 
President Iliescu. 
  The Romanian president expressed his hope that the meetings 
between the businessmen who were accompanying the Indian 
president and Romanian businessmen would lead to results 
encouraging for both parties. 
  The exchange of views which we had, said President Iliescu, 
evinced the common preoccupations of the governments of Romania 
and India to promote understanding, collaboration, and peace in 
the world, and the common attachment to the universal values of 
the democracy. 
  In the field of external relations, Romania is engaged in 
the 
process of integration within the economic, political, and 
strategic European structures, and it develops cooperation 
relations with the countries with democratic traditions and with 
all its neighbors, said President Iliescu. 
  At the same time, within the strategy of its foreign policy, 
Romania grants special importance to the development of the 
traditional relations with the countries in the Asian-Pacific 
zone, one of the regions with the highest economic growth and 
healthy prospects for continued development in the coming 
decades, India holding a front-line place in that respect, said 
President Iliescu. 
  In his toast, Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma said 
that 
in the latest years there have been active contacts at various 
levels between Romania and India. 
  While the mutual visits by parliamentary delegations 
revealed 
the mutually shared political beliefs, the agreements signed in 
the fields of trade, science, and technology are an expression 
of the common decision to substantiate the bilateral relations, 
said the Indian president. 
  The economic restructuring taking place in India and the 
reform program launched in Romania create considerable 
possibilities for cooperation to mutual benefit, said the Indian 
head of state. 
  The prominent businessmen -- members of the Indian 
delegation 
accompanying the Indian president -- are expressing India's 
decision to diversify, increase, and stimulate economic 
cooperation with Romania, said the Indian president. 
  President Shankar Dayal Sharma expressed confidence that 
Romanian-Indian relations would gain substance and diversify. 
The Indian Government wishes to cooperate with the Romanian 
Government in order to carry out some common objectives, said 
the president. 
  The last decade of the century is offering chances, but also 
responsibilities. The magnitude of the problems confronting 
mankind shows that there is no country that can afford to live 
in isolation. Peace and prosperity are really indivisible in 
this world, in which we all live. India, as well as Romania 
have committed themselves in promoting the cause of peace and in 
building a fair, safe, and prosperous international order. I am 
convinced that our concerted actions will bring a significant 
contribution to this cause, to the mutual benefit of our 
countries, to the benefit of the entire humanity, said the 
Indian president.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Indian President 
Shankar Dayal Sharma, now on an official visit to Romania, 
addressed the two chambers of Romania's Parliament in joint 
sitting on 31 May. 
  The Indian president conveyed to Romania "the fraternal 
salute of India's Government, Parliament and people." He spoke 
of freedom and democracy and showed that where there was freedom 
of thought and expression the most differing views could be set 
forth, to the benefit of democracy. 
  The visit by the Indian president, who is accompanied by a 
delegation of ministers and parliamentarians, is the first visit 
after 1989 by an Asian head of state to Romania. 
  Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman assessed in his 
welcoming address that India was a potential supporter of the 
development of Romania's relations with other Asian states. He 
also hoped Romania would be able to be in turn a European gate 
for India.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- The importance of 
the development of the bilateral economic and commercial 
relations was evoked during the interview on 31 May between 
Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Romanian Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  Noting the current growing tendency of the bilateral trade, 
the Indian president pointed to the need for speeding up that 
process. The guest appreciated the Romanian-Indian relations as 
a bridge between Asia and Europe, considering that Romania could 
become in future an economic leader in Eastern Europe. The 
Indian party's interest in developing economic relations with 
Romania resulted also from the fact that the delegation included 
four members of the Indian cabinet -- ministers of the interior, 
foreign affairs, tourism and agriculture, as well as the 
president of the Association of Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry of India. 
  Premier Vacaroiu evoked the traditional friendship between 
the two countries and emphasized the necessity of extending the 
current legal framework, so that the fine political bilateral 
relations should be matched by economic ones. The creation 
during the visit of an adequate legal framework is a component 
of utmost importance of the government's policy of relaunching 
and expanding the traditional economic and commercial relations 
of Romania, Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu added.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/6/1994 -- Romania's 
traditional relations with the neighbors, Bulgaria included, 
hold an important place in the government's policy, said on June 
1 Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu during his interview with 
Stoyan Aleksandrov, Bulgarian finance minister. 
  During the dialogue that occasioned an extensive exchange of 
information and views on the progress of the reform in the two 
countries, they agreed that the bilateral relations were, along 
with each state's development efforts, the only way out of the 
economic crisis, the way of relaunching the production and 
speeding up the reform. Reference was made in that context to 
the possibilities of collaboration that, as agreed, would be 
analyzed during the session of the joint commissions due at the 
end of June. 
  Premier Vacaroiu noted that, although the Romanian-Bulgarian 
trade has kept at a constant level lately, there were unlimited 
possibilities to increase the bilateral relations, which needs 
the completion of a new legal framework. 
  Sharing that opinion, Aleksandrov showed that during his 
Romanian visit two important agreements were signed on economic 
relations (the convention on avoiding double taxation and the 
agreement on mutual promotion and protection of investments.) 
He highlighted the necessity of periodical contacts between 
similar institutions in the two countries, of a permanent 
exchange of information concerning each party's positive 
experience.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Romanian President 
Ion Iliescu received at Cotroceni Palace on 31 May Miltiades 
Evert, president of the New Democracy Party of the Hellenic 
Republic, leader of the opposition in Greece. 
  After recalling the fine relations between Romania and 
Greece, even at the time when the two countries belonged to 
differing social systems, the Hellenic politician pleaded in a 
press statement for the necessity of establishing a climate of 
peace in the Balkans. "Romania, Bulgaria and Greece are spaces 
of stability and these countries have to take over the 
initiative of pacifying the Balkans," Miltiades Evert said. 
  He mentioned he proposed to the Romanian president "the 
signing of an agreement on existing frontiers intangibility" by 
the Balkan countries, as well as the passage to concrete 
measures for such a document to be signed the soonest. "The 
signing of such an agreement would be the first great step 
toward peace in the Balkans, that should be ensured first of all 
by the Balkan peoples," he added. 
  In the same context, Miltiades Evert said that the signing 
of 
the proposed agreement would be difficult at this moment for 
Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, countries that are at war now, but 
the other states in the zone, he said, were bound to do it 
"precisely in order to prevent the expansion of the conflict and 
to ensure welfare and economic development in the Balkans." 
  The conclusion of treaties to guarantee the current 
frontiers 
can be a first step toward securing peace in the Balkans, 
assessed Miltiadis Evert, president of the New Democracy Party 
of Greece, during an interview with Romanian Minister of Labour 
and Social Protection Dan Mircea Popescu, in Bucharest, on 31 
May. 
  The interview occasioned a survey of the stage of the 
bilateral relations which, they assessed, had to be increased 
and diversified, as well as the approach of stability and 
cooperation in the Balkans. 
  Minister Dan Mircea Popescu outlined to the guest the 
Romanian Government's current priorities, emphasizing among them 
the securing of an adequate social protection and an increasing 
living standard of the population. He considered the 
difficulties Romania was going through at this time could be 
eased only through good-quality work, an efficient management 
and steady international economic cooperation, which, between 
Romania and Greece, could be achieved on multiple planes.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/6/1994 -- At the arrival from 
the spring session of the North-Atlantic Assembly which took 
place in Oslo over May 26-31, the head of the Romanian 
parliamentary delegation, Ion Ratiu, and the president of the 
Defense Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, Petre Roman, made 
statements underscoring Romania's interest in the integration 
within NATO at a date as near as possible. 
  "We can tell that we have affirmed our position with regard 
to the Partnership for Peace. It was my duty to express 
Romania's stance in the plenary session. Our position was very 
much appreciated and we are waiting to see as soon as possible 
the criteria that we have to match in order to integrate within 
this organisation," said Ion Ratiu. 
  "We are supporters and active participants in the 
Partnership 
for Peace program with the clear intention to integrate within 
the NATO structures. Our efforts must be sustained by an 
internal evolution toward a stable and prosperous economy (...) 
so that Romania is among the group of countries to be received 
in NATO in the first five years," said Deputy Petre Roman. 
  "To the basic document called 'The NATO Enlargement' we have 
contributed with some clarifications concerning Romania's 
contribution during the war in the Gulf, its contribution to the 
peace-keeping forces operating in Somalia, the price paid by 
Romania because of the embargoes against Iraq and Yugoslavia and 
the clear openness showed by Romania with respect to military 
cooperation."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Iulian Radulescu, a 
Gypsy self titled "Emperor Iulian the First of all Roms," was 
freed on bail on 30 May, a few days after his arrest by the 
police. 
  Involved in bulk misappropriation of electrolytic copper 
from 
the Ampelum copper field of Zlatna, Iulian Radulescu had been 
accused of selling, jointly with his accomplices, stolen copper 
to Turkey through a connection the ramifications of which are 
not entirely known yet. 
  On 20 May this year the police and prosecutor's office of 
Alba County issued a warrant, his apprehension proper being 
possible as late as 26 May, when Radulescu returned to Romania 
from Spain, where, according to his statement, he had been 
invited to take part in an international symposium of Romanis 
held in Seville. 
  "I want an inquest fitting my imperial status," he said upon 
his arrest, and promised to cooperate with the police for the 
clarification of the circumstances. 
  According to the population census of January 1992, 
registered as living in Romania are 409,720 Gypsies (Romanis or 
Roms,) which form the second largest ethnic minority after 
Hungarians recorded as numbering 1,620,000. Gypsy leaders speak 
of figures higher than the official records. 
  Iulian Radulescu "crowned" himself "Emperor of Roms 
Everywhere" in August 1993, more than one and a half years after 
the ceremony during which a cousin of his, Ioan Cioaba, 
proclaimed himself "International King of Roms in Romania on 
Five Continents." The two "crowned heads" are in-laws, their 
children having been married in 1989 in the United States. Both 
Radulescu and Cioaba live in Sibiu. 
  The Gypsies in Romania do not seem to take the two 
"monarchs" 
seriously, most of them ignoring them completely. 
  As in the case of other ethnic minorities, their leaders 
failed to be elected to parliament in the September 1992 
elections. The Gypsies are yet represented to the legislative 
body by a deputy thanks to the provisions of the Romanian 
Constitution, which enables each ethnic minority to appoint a 
representative to parliament.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 31/5/1994 -- Marian Munteanu, 
head of the Movement for Romania [MPR], presented to a news 
conference on 31 May a document, dated 20 December 1993, issued 
by the Association for the Redemption of the Rights and 
Properties of the Jews of Romanian Extraction. 
  According to Marian Munteanu, the document had been advanced 
to the government and Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu. He claimed that 
meetings had taken place on the issue of Holocaust in Romania. 
In the presented document, the Association demands from the 
Romanian state the restitution of the material assets possessed 
by the former Romanian citizens of Jewish origin and assumption 
by the Romanian state of responsibility for the killing of 
400,000 Jews during the Second World War, by the "Romanian 
fascist" regime. 
  Marian Munteanu thinks the claims are not justified, since 
"there was no fascist state and no Holocaust in Romania" and the 
figure of 400,000 is "a simple mistake caused by insufficient 
knowledge of historic reality." The Movement for Romania, a 
non-parliamentary party, considers that the victims of 
repression and violence in Romania were Romanians and by no 
means the national minorities. A commitment by the state's 
current rulers to what the Jewish organizations claim might lead 
to Romania's economic enslaving, forcing the Romanian people to 
pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and retrocession of 
real estate and enterprises, Marian Munteanu said. He hoped 
Romania's president would deny the claims of the Association for 
Redemption of the Rights and Properties of the Jews of Romanian 
Extraction.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 1 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Josef 
Moravcik expressed his interest in meeting the new Hungarian 
government as soon as possible at a press conference today and 
said a "radical solution" to open questions between the two 
countries could be expected before Slovakia's autumn elections. 
General elections are to be held on September 30 and October 1. 
  He said he was satisfied that the Slovak-Hungarian 
readmission agreement -- Bratislava's condition for the opening 
of new border crossings -- was ready for signing. Slovakia was 
also ready to sign an agreement dividing the waters of the 
Danube between the canal to supply the Gabcikovo hydroelectric 
power station and the old course of the river. "The basic aim is 
to find a solution that will improve the environmental 
situation," he said, adding that "all the possibilities (exist) 
for achieving a solution." 
  The basic bilateral agreement on good neighborly relations 
"must contain a guarantee of the inviolability of the borders", 
which in Bratislava's view is a "condition without which 
confidence cannot be established," he said. 
  He said some Slovaks were concerned about the possibility 
the 
borders with Hungary would be changed, but personally he did not 
believe this was Hungary's intent. 
  Furthermore the agreement ought to safeguard minority rights 
to the extent required by international norms, he said. 
Slovakia insisted, however, on the rights of the individual and 
opposed the conferment of collective rights for the 
half-million-strong Hungarian minority. 
  Moravcik rejected the criticism recently leveled by Miklos 
Duray, chairman of the Hungarian minority movement Egyutteles 
that Moravcik's government was not honoring the pledges it made 
on acceding to the European charter on minority languages and 
community autonomy. He said cooperation with Hungarian minority 
parties was reflected in the government policy declaration. 
  "We are not bound to any other document," he said. Slovakia 
had refused to sign this pledge in the charter, and "Mr. Duray 
knows this".

  [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The signing of the 
Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement, the draft of which was 
approved by the Slovak cabinet today, would open new prospects 
in relations between the two countries, Slovak Interior Minister 
Ladislav Pittner told CTK today. "The signature of the 
readmission agreement will naturally also simplify the question 
of opening further border crossings," Pittner said. 
  The draft agreement has been prepared in cooperation with 
Hungary, but it would be necessary, unofficial Foreign Ministry 
sources say, to discuss its wording with the new Hungarian 
Government. 
  Pittner described the draft agreement as similar to 
readmission agreements already concluded between Slovakia and 
its other neighbors. The only exception is a provision 
concerning the deadline for returning persons to Hungary, 
according to which illegal refugees have to be returned in 48 
hours. 
  Hungary has so far linked the signing of the 
Hungarian-Slovak 
readmission agreement with the opening of new border crossings 
and a change of a similar Slovak-Romanian agreement, which does 
not include a provision on returning refugees from third 
countries. In contrast to this, the Slovak Government of 
ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar made the opening of the border 
crossings conditional on the signing of the agreement, rejecting 
Hungary's proposal that only Hungarian citizens be returned.

  [Text] Bratislava, May 31 (CTK) -- The Slovak National 
Party (SNS) said today the statements by Gyula Horn, leader of 
the Hungarian Socialists who won the parliamentary elections, 
about chances to settle Slovak-Hungarian relations and to 
conclude a basic interstate treaty were inadmissible. The 
statement said that Horn's statement that Hungary would seek the 
renovation of friendly relations with Slovakia, Romania and 
Yugoslavia in exchange for guarantees for the rights of the 
three million ethnic Hungarians living there were dangerous for 
Slovakia and can be considered intervention in its internal 
affairs. 
  Now in the opposition, the SNS was a coalition partner of 
Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) 
until mid-March when the coalition government was dismissed. 
The SNS has 9 out of a total of 150 seats in parliament. "It is 
unacceptable for Slovakia that Hungarian politicians demand 
administrative autonomy for their ethnic minority," the 
statement stressed in reaction to Horn's words that he was going 
to satisfy Bratislava's demand for the confirmation of the 
existing border only at the cost of "autonomous rights" for 
minorities. 
  Slovakia has been pushing for the confirmation of the border 
which was determined after World War One and which has been 
doubted recently by certain forces in Hungary. Some 560,000 
ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia, mainly in the south, 
constituting about 11 per cent of its population. The SNS 
pointed to the status of ethnic minorities in Hungary which 
"cannot have their own political party and representation in the 
parliament." Two ethnic Hungarians's political entities are 
represented in the Slovak Parliament: the Egyutteles movement 
(9 parliamentary seats) and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH, 5 seats). The statement said that 
Hungarian-Slovak relations which have been tense over ethnic 
minorities would probably become even "more stormy" following 
the victory of Horn's Socialists in Hungary.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 1 (CTK) -- "We have not dropped the 
idea of union and we will not do so," Miklos Duray, Chairman of 
ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles [Coexistence] told journalists today. 
  "If we fail to form one now, we will come back to it after 
the elections. However, at present we are willing to negotiate 
with other parties about a tight coalition," he added. 
  Some of the Hungarian parties have announced they oppose the 
idea. 
  Duray defined the "essential conditions" for creating the 
coalition of Hungarian groupings: after successfully entering 
the Slovak parliament the Hungarian representatives must, first 
and foremost, create a joint deputies group. The Egyutteles 
(with 9 deputies in the 150-member Slovak parliament the 
strongest Hungarian party) will demand from them a unified 
strategy in local elections with joint candidates for mayors. 
Duray is also pushing for a unified strategy of Hungarian 
deputies in foreign policy issues. 
  "Should any of the parties breach the accord, it will not be 
allowed to claim the relevant sum from the state contribution 
for the elections," Duray warned.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia June 1 (CTK) -- The former 
Slovak Defence Minister Imrich Andrejcak has criticised the 
changes made in the Partnership for Peace presentation document 
by Defence Minister Pavol Kanis. Andrejcak made his comments 
during an interview with the Slovak regional daily LUC, which 
carries it today. The changes mean that the ministry's 
contribution to the funding of the Partnership project will now 
be up to 4.5 percent instead of the originally envisaged one per 
cent, Andrejcak says. The promise to send more troops to 
ex-Yugoslavia and to set up a stand-by battalion available to 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] at short notice will cause extra 
arms and equipment expenditure, and might compromise the Slovak 
Army's readiness for battle, Andrejcak says. "Some army 
functionaries take advantage of Mr. Kanis' unfamiliarity with 
army codes and customary procedures," he says. 
  In the case of the crash of the Slovak Army's SU-22 military 
plane in April an investigation report calculated the financial 
loss and clarified the disaster's causes. "I believe that in 
this very case some functionaries have tricked the minister 
(Kanis) as a way of finding an easy way out," Andrejcak says in 
LUC.

  [Text] Pristina, May 31 (ATA) -- Serbian security forces 
intervened today in the surroundings of the "Alaudin" Muslim 
school where it was holding the assembly of the Pristina 
University, ATA correspondent reported on Tuesday [31 May]. The 
Serbian police forces blocked the hall and interrupted the 
assembly proceedings in which were supposed to be treated the

institutions of the Republic of Kosova. Recently, the 
interventions have been intensified.

<F P=106> [Part one of a five-part article by Alexandru I. Mihail: </F>
"Concerted Fire Upon the Leu" -- all figures as published] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that 1993 was the fourth year of 
the transition period, instead of decreasing, the rate of 
inflation grew by 320 percent, which represents an average 
growth rate of about 30 percent each month. In 1993 the growth 
of inflation doubled as compared to the whole period between 
1990 and 1992. This proves that the general state of our 
economy has gravely deteriorated and by no means that the 
decline was halted, as claimed by the executive. This is so 
because the inflation rate reflects all the important figures 
characteristic of our economy in the current period: the 
dynamics of industrial production, which stays constantly at a 
level of 50 percent as compared to the same figure in 1989, 
lessening the possibility for the money existing on the market 
to be absorbed; the state budget deficit amounting to almost 800 
billion lei, which means inflation; the volume of "current" 
loans worth over 400 billion lei which are immobilized in the 
state-owned sector of the economy, which causes a genuine 
monetary bleeding; the debts (outstanding loan debts and 
payments to be paid to furnishers, banks, and so on) amounting 
to approximately 2.400 trillion lei, which seems to be buried 
for good, and our hard currency reserves that almost invariably 
amount to $100 million to $300 million (as compared to the $3.5 
billion hard currency reserves of Hungary!) 
  While in the first two to three years of the transition 
inflation was partially justified by the transformations that 
took place in the economy, in the fourth year the rampant 
acceleration of the rate of inflation is an extremely alarming 
phenomenon. It reflects a fundamentally mistaken economic 
policy, a regression in the productive sectors (industry and 
agriculture,) a slow-down in investments, and the virtual 
blocking of the reform. 
  All assertions intended to calm down the spirits, claiming 
that in neighboring countries similar inflation processes are 
taking place, are nothing but gross deceptions, typical attempts 
to mislead public opinion. Here is the proof of the evolution 
of the leu compared to the dollar and to the national currencies 
of the neighboring countries: 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The dollar's exchange rate on 31 December 1989                               | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1. The Czech koruna                   |24                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|2. The Hungarian forint               |60                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|3. The leu                            |35                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The dollar's exchange rate on 20 May 1994                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1. The Czech koruna                   |28                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|2. The Hungarian forint               |80                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|3. The leu                            |1,615                                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|The devaluation of national currencies over December 1989-May 1994           | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|(in percent)                                                                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|1. The Czech koruna                   |17                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|2. The Hungarian forint               |33                                    | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
|3. The leu                            |4,600                                 | 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  One leu, which four years ago was worth one Czech koruna, 
now 
merely represents the 58th part of the latter. Similarly, one 
leu, which in 1989 was rated as equal to one Hungarian forint, 
now is merely worth the 20th part of the latter. 
  The same dramatic evolution can be noted also as compared to 
other Western currencies, such as the Italian lira, which four 
years ago was rated 100 lire to 1 leu, while today 1 lira is 
worth 1.03 leu, that is, its value exceeds that of the leu. 
  The collapse of the leu makes itself felt in the baskets of 
Romanians, which contain less each day. It is a genuine 
monetary catastrophe caused by the collapse of the economy. The 
devaluation of the national currencies of former Yugoslavia and 
the former USSR can in no way be compared with that of the leu, 
as in the case of the former states it was caused by territorial 
and ethnic armed conflicts, coups, and so on, which did and do 
not take place in Romania. 
  The acceleration of the inflation process in Romania is 
only partly due to the drop in industrial and agricultural 
production, as the gross industrial product merely decreased by 
40 percent as compared to 1989, while the leu devaluated by 46 
times its value. 
  This intensifying of the inflation was principally caused by 
errors made in the governing of the country. Above all, this 
refers to the successive liberalization of prices, which totally 
escaped from under control, thus acting as a genuine attempt 
upon our national currency. The chaos was furthered by the 
passive stance of the ministries, which let the producers do 
anything they wished, as well as by the lack of firmness on 
behalf of the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank. The 
latter did not request that abusively established prices should 
be corrected, they did not practically intercede in any way, and 
they did not supervise the liberalization of prices as if it 
could not have affected the circulation of money in any way. 
Abuses in prices and fees generated and are still generating 
inflation; inflation was also caused by the fact that companies 
were allowed to include in their prices the cost of irrational 
use of raw materials, energy, fuel, and spare parts, the costs 
of maintaining all the personnel while production was dropping, 
the poor quality of their products, and so on. All this made 
prices of products and services artificially increase and, 
implicitly, the leu's purchasing power drop; that is, it caused 
large-scale inflation. 
  Inflation considerably increased also owing to the fact that 
over the 1990-1994 period state companies paid several thousands 
of billions of lei to their employees, without any control 
whatsoever, as it was sufficient if the public corporation or 
the commercial company had enough money in its bank account at 
the moment the payments were made. That is, no one checked 
whether they were producing or not, whether their products could 
be sold or not, whether they were merely working with 50 percent 
or even less of their production capacity, whether they were 
working at a profit, that is, whether they could actually afford 
to pay the salaries. The gravest thing of all, regardless of 
whether the companies owed money to their suppliers, banks, or 
the state, they were still allowed to pay salaries from their 
current incomes without first paying their debts. Actually, 
salaries were paid from the money they owed their suppliers, 
banks, and the state budget. 
  Sometimes the banks did not even forfeit the interest for 
the 
borrowed amount. The banks merely checked whether the companies 
paid the income taxes and the social security fees of their 
employees, while in the case of public corporations and 
state-owned commercial companies the representatives of the 
state allowed for the payment of salaries even without any 
control whatsoever. In 1993 alone in the state-owned sector of 
the economy salaries worth over 3,000 billion lei were paid 
(about 70,000 lei in real salary paid monthly to each of the 3.9 
million employees in the state sector of the economy.) If 
merely one third of that amount was paid over the past four 
years without economic justification or without the companies 
actually being able to pay, we already spotted the principal 
source of inflation. 
  The Ministry of Finance, the National Bank, and the Banking 
Association never protested the law which allows for the payment 
of salaries before first paying company debts to the suppliers, 
banks, and the state budget. No lucid and reasonable finance 
expert would have accepted that payments should be made in that 
order in the state sector of the economy, especially in a period 
when that sector was subjected to profound restructuring, it was 
being adapted to market economy, and so on. No private 
entrepreneur can afford to pay salaries regardless of anything 
else, because he would go bankrupt, a thing which, however, 
cannot happen to our state-owned companies. 
  Associated with the introduction of the five-day work week, 
such inflation-causing practices explain to a great extent the 
continuous descent of our economy and our national currency. 
Both of those aspects prove incompetence and a superficial 
handling of the big issues of the country and they are obvious 
concessions made for populist reasons, which encouraged people 
not to work, disorder, and inflation. This irresponsible system 
of salary payments continued in 1994 as well, hindering reform 
and alarmingly aggravating inflation. This happens because no 
one has the courage to halt the payment of salaries in the 
companies that are indebted, fearing that this would stop the 
activity of the employees of a large number of companies and 
public corporations. 
  The non-existence of control over prices and fees, as well 
as 
over the payment of salaries, stimulated the production of goods 
that have no markets, that is, the so-called producing for the 
stocks. This type of production invariably amounts to about 
10-15 percent of the entire production. 
  The producing for the stocks generates inflation because the 
money spent on the manufacturing of those goods is not returned 
to the economic circuit or it is only partially returned and 
with great delay. In certain sectors producing for the stocks 
is still continuing, as its negative consequences are obviously 
ignored. 
  The bank loans granted over the past years are greatly 
responsible for generating inflation. In 1990 the state-owned 
companies were granted loans worth about 400 billion lei, in 
1991 worth 700 billion lei, all at a low interest rate which on 
the average did not exceed 10 to 15 percent. These loans 
actually represented a hidden state subsidizing of the 
non-profitable or low-efficiency companies. The amount that was 
not paid back for the aforementioned loans generated inflation, 
similarly to the loans worth about 3,000 billion lei granted 
over 1992 and 1993. 
  Such explosion of the loans over 1993 occurred as a result 
of 
the unprecedented growth of inflation and also caused, in turn, 
inflation. This happened because a significant part of those 
loans was used to cover deficiencies, to pay for older debts, 
and so on, and not to stimulate production and attract the cash 
existing on the market. 
  Inflation was directly generated by the so-called 
compensation loans worth 500 billion lei, which were granted in 
1992, to unblock the accounts of certain state-owned companies. 
This allowed them to go on paying salaries and spend further 
money for the non-profitable manufacturing of goods, produce for 
the stocks, and temporarily used up funds taken out of the 
economic circuit, by which it created inflation. Strictly 
financially speaking, this was a genuine disaster, as no bank in 
the whole world would grant loans to unblock accounts, as that 
would imply a 100-percent inflation. 
  Similarly grave is the fact that a significant part of the 
loans granted over 1991-1993 was used for speculative purchasing 
of hard currency, which was subsequently hoarded up at home or 
abroad. This amount of lei was taken out of the economic 
circuit, thus also generating inflation. 
  Profiting from the slackness and lack of control on behalf 
of 
the banks, certain companies, mainly those owned by the state, 
did whatever they wished with the loans, thus depriving the 
economy of important financial resources. We are still paying 
the penalties for those acts of abuse and grave errors that were 
caused to a great extent by the incompetence of the Ministry of 
Finance and the National Bank, which tolerated and encouraged 
abuse by not trying to stop it.

"Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] 
  [Text] The progressive increase of the interest rate 
applied to the bank loans granted over 1991-1992 from 10 percent 
to about 70 percent contributed, along with other factors, to a 
drop in the production of goods and services, which could have 
absorbed the cash available on the market. Such an increase of 
the interest rate indirectly caused inflation, as its weight in 
companies' spending rose to 30-50 percent. This compelled the 
companies to increase the prices of the products or services 
they offered. 
  The idea of increasing the interest rate over the first 
years 
of the transition period went completely wrong. Instead of 
restraining inflation, the high interest rates made it grow even 
faster. Besides artificially increasing the prices of products 
and services, the growth of the interest rate discouraged 
activity in industry, agriculture, services, and tourism, 
precisely the branches from which a revival was expected, which 
would have strengthened the national currency. The increase of 
the interest rate did not achieve the expected results in the 
case of the nonprofitable or low-efficiency companies either, as 
they proved to be unable to pay the higher interest rates but 
still did not go bankrupt, continuing to produce at higher or 
lesser losses. The increase of the interest rate was not 
something to be recommended at all within the circumstances of 
an economy torn by a decades-long structural crisis. The 
restructuring of economy should have been stimulated rather than 
blocked by the loan and interest rate policy. This could have 
been achieved by applying strongly differentiated interests. 
Thus, investments should have been protected, including the 
building of blocks of apartments. The loans granted to this 
purpose, including their interest, could have been easily 
regained by selling the apartments to the population. 
Protection should have been granted, by a similar loan policy, 
to the light and food industry, generally to the small 
manufacturers, and especially those in agricultural production. 
To compensate for all this, very high interest rates could have 
been introduced in commercial activity, where under the 
circumstances of a very rapid circulation of goods, encompassing 
just 30 days, a 180-percent annual interest rate actually would 
represent merely 15 percent. This solution is still valid today. 
  High interest rates may be applied in economically highly 
developed countries, in which the companies own large financial 
resources. However, under the circumstances of our country, in 
which the majority of the state-owned or private companies, even 
the efficient ones, do not have their own financial resources, 
high interest rates prevent them from resorting to bank loans. 
Considering that owing to a totally wrong policy, foreign 
capital cannot be attracted either, actually there is no source 
of funds. The lack of capital is the gravest current problem in 
the Romanian economy. Currently there is a genuine hunger for 
money, both lei and dollars, and, paradoxically enough from the 
economic point of view, at the same time there is also a general 
refraining from loans, due to the high interest rates. 
  On the other hand, the accelerated growth of inflation over 
the recent period makes it very difficult to maintain the 
current level of interest rates, as it would inevitably lead to 
the decapitalization of commercial companies and banks. The 
recent promise made by Prime Minister Vacaroiu and [National 
Bank] Governor Isarescu to reduce interest rates in the near 
future cannot be accomplished. As a matter of fact, in 1992 the 
governor of the National Bank also promised that by the end of 
that year he would reduce interest rates to 30 percent, but he 
did not keep his word. 
  The entire chain of errors and hesitations in the hard 
currency and exchange rate policy also contributed to the 
gradual depreciation of the leu's purchasing power. In the 
years 1990 and 1991 state-owned and private companies were left 
50 percent of the hard currency made by them in exports. By the 
end of 1991, when the limited convertibility of the leu was 
introduced, they were left nothing of the hard currency they 
made, thus making it difficult for them to buy supplies from 
abroad, which implicitly hindered production. Six months later, 
more exactly in May 1992, the government went back on that 
decision, leaving the companies the whole amount of hard 
currency they earned from exports. This decision was not a 
well-pondered one either, because what followed was the National 
Bank's lack of hard currency, which created great problems for 
importers. This to and fro in the hard currency policy led to 
the companies' losing confidence in the National Bank so they 
began to place the hard currency they earned from exports in 
banks located abroad. The presumed amount of about $800 million 
existing in foreign banks is also generating inflation, as the 
lei spent for the manufacturing of those goods never returned to 
the economic circuit of our country. 
  Both the previous taking and the leaving, as of May 1992, of 
the entire amount of hard currency made by companies from their 
exports contributed to the weakening of our economy and national 
currency. 
  The fact that companies have to come up with the entire 
amount of hard currency in case of imports continues to cause 
great problems, especially to companies which are big energy, 
fuel, raw materials, and equipment consumers, the products of 
which, however, are not intended for exportation. The negative 
consequences of these measures upon our economy are as grave as 
those caused by the state's taking all the hard currency 
obtained from exports. 
  A significant part of the country's hard currency assets -- 
which are quite limited anyhow -- was wasted by the companies 
which had to buy their dollars in auctions. The auctions were 
also participated in by companies that had debts in lei to be 
paid to banks, the state budget, or their suppliers. Should the 
participation in dollar auctions of indebted companies be 
prohibited by law? There is no way in which such regulations 
could really be observed, as hard currency requests for imports 
intended to be used to produce export products ought to be 
exempted. This means that the companies will continue to buy 
hard currency for speculation purposes, which has negative 
consequences upon the leu. 
  The superficial way and the haste with which they introduced 
the limited convertibility of the leu (we would have needed at 
least $3 billion in assets, whereas all we had at that time was 
$400 million) contributed to the gravest devaluation of the leu 
in its entire history, that is from 180 to 400 lei to the dollar 
within just a few months in 1992. Ever since then the leu has 
continued to devaluate steadily at a rate corresponding to the 
accelerated growth of inflation. Actually, this was the 
beginning of the end. 
  The use of the foreign loans worth about $4 billion to cover 
immediate consumption needs (raw materials, energy, fuel, and 
food), rather than to enhance production or make investments, 
also promoted inflation. This happened because the loans were 
spent without making it possible for the leu to recover. 
Besides this, owing to the progressive devaluation of the leu, 
now we have to make eight or nine times bigger efforts to pay 
those loans back. This additional effort will aggravate 
inflation in a catastrophic way. Not having appropriate hard 
currency assets or other resources, the National Bank will see 
itself compelled to buy dollars in auctions offering 1,600 lei 
for the dollar, so that it can pay back the foreign loans 
obtained over 1990-1991, when the dollar was worth less than 200 
lei. 
  Well before the revolution, but in a more accentuated way 
following that moment, there were and still are a number of 
factors that acted as a burden on our national currency, all of 
them being caused by a totally wrong economic policy. 
  A simplistic assessment might lead to the conclusion that to 
curb inflation it would suffice if a significant part of the 
gross industrial product would be earmarked for the market, that 
is to attract the monetary mass currently in circulation. 
However, the truth is that over many years in Romania the part 
of the gross industrial product that is able to attract the 
monetary mass has had a very reduced weight. In the case of a 
large number of domestic products, such as clothes, shoes, radio 
sets, cigarettes, cosmetics, sweets, sodas, canned food, and so 
on, their poor quality and high prices make them difficult to 
sell, as the consumers prefer the imported products. Even in 
the case of products the quality of which is acceptable 
(furniture, automobiles, tractors, color television sets, and so 
on), their exorbitant prices make them inaccessible to the 
majority of the population. Certain producers' tendencies to 
export their products, more exactly their hunger for dollars 
(for instance in the case of automobiles, tractors, 
refrigerators, and so on) also prevents the absorption of the 
cash available on our market. 
  Similarly negative consequences may be seen owing to the 
very 
poor quality of the services offered to the population in a 
great number of localities of the country. Let alone the 
enormous price requested for certain services (heating, electric 
power, and so on), services that account for the largest part of 
the total spending of the population in the entire world, which 
prohibits the purchase of other merchandise, thus gravely 
aggravating inflation. If citizens have to spend half of their 
earnings on food and the other half on heating, electricity, 
transportation, and other services, they are left no money to 
spend on nonedible merchandise, which thus remains unsold and 
accentuates inflation. 
  Pressure is exerted upon our monetary mass also by the 
freezing of the possibilities for the great majority of the 
population to rent or buy living quarters, while their savings 
hoarded for that purpose are continuously depreciating. Just by 
selling the 64,000 apartments that have been left unfinished 
[after December 1989], several billion lei could be absorbed 
from the savings of the population made for that purpose.

  COST OF ILLEGAL SALES: The Supreme Inspection Office 
discovered that the National Property Fund (FNM) chaired by 
Tomas Jezek had illegally passed property worth billions to 
private investors. This began with the government decision of 8 
January 1992 to sell more than 1 million shares of Cokoladovny 
(Chocolate Works) Prague to Swiss Nestle, French BSN, and the 
EBRD for 3.26 billion korunas (Kc). The FNM violated this 
decision and sold without approval approximately 85,000 shares 
to the Prvni Investicni (First Investment) Co. (current value 
Kc637 million for a profit between the purchase price and 
current value of Kc532.5 million -- the profit would have 
exceeded Kc1 billion if sold in February). The Fund also sold 
almost one-third more shares to approved buyers than authorized 
by the cabinet, and not at the price of Kc3,119 set by the 
government but approximately 30 percent cheaper so the total 
received corresponds to the total price approved. The price of 
the illegally sold stock is approximately Kc3 billion (and was 
as much as Kc5.8 billion). (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 27 Apr 
94 p 1) Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus today dismissed press 
claims that in talks with Deputy Prime Minister Jan Kalvoda and 
Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky last week he had decided to 
postpone the dismissal of FNM Chairman Tomas Jezek. On 30 April 
the left-orientated RUDE PRAVO, referring to an unnamed 
"coalition source" wrote that Klaus, together with Kalvoda and 
Skalicky had decided on Thursday (28 April) not to dismiss Jezek 
for the time being. According to the paper, the dismissal was 
demanded by six out of the nine members of the FNM council, 
which is chaired by Skalicky. After the council's meeting, 
Skalicky told journalists that the council members had made a 
number of criticial comments on FNM activity, but did not 
dismiss Jezek. Speculation about Jezek's dismissal or 
resignation appearead especially in connection with recent 
scandals accompanying the sales of the shares of some 
enterprises held by the FNM. (Prague CTK in English 1648 GMT 2 
May 94) 
  VIDEOTEXT FRENCH CONNECTION: The Czech Republic is the first 
of the postcommunist countries to connect its videotext network 
to the French Teletel system (subsidiary of Telecom). Through 
the French network subscribers obtain contacts to all EU 
countries and the United States. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 
27 Apr 94 p 2) 
  TAX PACT WITH ISRAEL: The parliament today approved an 
agreement between the Czech Republic and Israel preventing 
double taxation and income tax evasion signed in December last 
year. Investors will now be able to make exact calculations of 
earnings from their investments, Economy Minister Karel Dyba 
said in parliament today. The agreement provides for the right 
to collect taxes from incomes and property to be divided between 
the two states if the source of income is in one country while 
the income is received by an individual resident in the second 
country. The agreement should render bilateral relations more 
objective in the economic, trade and cultural areas. (Prague 
CTK in English 1305 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  TAX PACT WITH ROMANIA: The Chamber of Deputies approved an 
agreement between the Czech Republic and Romania preventing 
double taxation and income tax evasion signed in Bucharest on 8 
November 1993. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 28 Apr 94 p 2) 
  SALES TO SIEMENS: The sale of Moravian Electrical 
Engineering Works plants in Mohelnice, Frenstat pod Radhostem, 
and Draslov to the German Siemens concern is to be approved 
within days. Siemens is to acquire 100 percent ownership of all 
three plants manufacturing asynchronous electric motors. 
According to the contract, Siemens will pay Kc1.5 billion and 
assume responsibility for possible environmental damage. It 
will invest another Kc1.3 billion in the plants. (Prague LIDOVE 
NOVINY in Czech 28 Apr 94 p 9) 
  SURVEY OF RETAILERS: A survey conducted by the Czech 
Statistical Office shows 80 percent retailers find their 
economic situation at the end of March normal. Sales improved 
in March for 70 percent of respondents, remained unchanged for 
18 percent, and declined for 12 percent. The financial 
situation of their business is assessed by 66 percent of those 
asked as the same as in February, as improved by 16 percent, and 
as worse by 18 percent of the respondents; 45 percent of the 
retailers report insolvency. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 28 
Apr 94 p 14) 
  AGRICULTURE LOSSES: According to Agriculture Minister Lux, 
1993 losses in agriculture reached Kc8 billion. Of this amount, 
Kc4.5 billion are losses generated by remaindered (zbytkove) 
state farms, so the actual deficit comes to about Kc4 billion. 
(Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 29 Apr 94 p 3) 
  SKODA INDONESIA BID: A Kaltimex Jaya representative visited 
Skoda Diesel in April. This firm represents Skoda interests in 
Indonesia. The purpose of the visit was to prepare a quality 
bid for a competition for a supply of an automatic 
diesel-electric power plant using waste heat. Approximately 80 
percent of Skoda Diesel production goes to exports 
(approximately $250 million) to markets like India, China, Peru, 
Iran, Egypt, Nigeria, and also Sweden. (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 29 Apr 94 p 6) 
  BUSINESS WITH LATIN AMERICA: On 28 April, 70 Czech 
businessmen returned from Latin America where they sought and 
found markets for their products. The LIAZ truck manufacturer 
signed a contract in Argentina with Vasquez Iglesias to supply 
40 vehicles valued at $1.5 million, 120-200 vehicles are to be 
shipped to Chile, and exports to Peru and Bolivia are also in 
the works. The Prerovske strojirny (Prerov Engineering Works) 
finalized its agreements with the Brazilian cement firm GIS on 
completion and bringing into operation of two plants worth $29 
million, and discussed a joint venture with the largest 
cement-manufacturing group in the country, Votorantim. As these 
examples show, the largest mission of Czech businessmen to Latin 
America so far proved the good prospects of this market for 
Czech firms. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 29 Apr 94 p 
21) The CZ Strakonice company will ship to Argentina this year 
12,000 motorcycles worth approximately $12 million. (Prague 
MLADA FRONTA DNES in Czech 30 Apr 94 p 14) 
  KUNZ PUMPS PROFITABLE: In 1993, the Kunz Hranice Co. (former 
subsidiary of Sigma) generated profit in the amount of Kc29.4 
million, and the estimated profit for this year is Kc55.8 
million. The traditional pump manufacturer intends to sell 
one-quarter of its production to Eastern Europe and East Asia. 
The largest single contract of the year is the supply of Kc240 
million worth of equipment for an aluminum factory in Nikolayev, 
Ukraine. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 29 Apr 94 FINANCNI 
NOVINY supplement p 1) 
  VITKOVICE IRON MILL LOSS: Vitkovice Iron Mills report for 
1993 after-tax losses in excess of Kc1 billion. The turnover for 
the year totalled Kc23 billion, output more than Kc13 billion. 
Exports declined by 17 percent in comparison with 1992. The 
company cut manpower by approximately 3,000 to 25,000. On the 
other hand, the average salary rose by 25 percent. The 
enterprise is transforming its production from metallurgy to 
engineering (currently 40 percent). (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in 
Czech 29 Apr 94 FINANCNI NOVINY supplement p 1) 
  CSOB ADJUSTS INTEREST: On 2 May, the CSOB (Czechoslovak 
Foreign Trade Bank) changes the rate of interest paid on certain 
foreign currency and koruna accounts. Some examples are the 
following: The interest on two-week koruna deposits increases 
by one-half percentage point (to 5.5-6.5 percent), and the 
increase is one-quarter percent on two to three months deposits. 
The rate of interest paid on deposits for terms longer than six 
months declines by up to 1 percentage point. (Prague RUDE PRAVO 
in Czech 29 Apr 94 p 8) 
  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: The Czech Statistical Office 
estimates that the volume of industrial production in the first 
quarter of 1994 is 0.8 percent lower than in the same period 
last year. The output was 0.9 percent lower in March 1994 than 
in the same month of 1993. The volume of construction in the 
first quarter was 6.5 percent higher than in the same period 
last year. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 29 Apr 94 p 8) 
  PROPERTY FUND BALANCES: The National Property Fund Presidium 
on 29 April adopted its annual report and closing balance. 
According to the report, a total of 2,962 privatization projects 
representing Kc871.6 billion were submitted to the fund by the 
Privatization Ministry as of 31 December 1993. Of these, 1,596 
(Kc599.3 billion worth) were actually implemented. The overall 
revenues to 31 December amounted to Kc54.2 billion, and 
expenditures to Kc42.9 billion. Only Kc2.8 billion, however, of 
the Kc11.3 billion surplus is liquid. (Prague CESKY DENIK in 
Czech 30 Apr 94 p 14) 
  PRAGUE-MANNHEIM AIR SERVICE: The Czech company 
Bemoinvest-Bemoair and the German airline Arcus-air-logistic are 
to open a regular service between Prague and Mannheim on May 9, 
Bemoinvest-Bemoair director Josef Drab told CTK on 30 April. 
For a start, the service will fly on weekdays, Drabek said. 
The two airlines plan a joint network of 60 booking offices 
across the Czech Republic, with those in industrial centres 
opening first in view of the service's intention to cater above 
all for entrepreneurs. Bemoair-operated L 41O UVP-E takes 17 
passengers, the same as the Dornier 228-212 operated by 
Arcus-air. Weekend charter flights to Karlovy Vary, West 
Bohemia, Piestany, West Slovakia, and the Vysoke Tatry mountain 
region in East Slovakia, with tourism in mind, will be operated 
later, Drabek said. (Prague CTK in English 1530 GMT 30 Apr 94) 
  ZBROJOVKA BRNO LOSSES: Despite sales of Kc450 million, 
Zbrojovka Brno (manufacturer of sporting arms, tools and 
tool-making machines) suffered losses of Kc200 million. The 
deficit is not a result of the operation but of too high an 
assessment of the value of the firm's property. The company 
intends to solve the situation by reducing the ordinary stock of 
the company -- currently Kc768 million -- by 20 percent. At the 
same time, the reserve fund is to be reduced by 86 percent. 
While the production of machinery and tools declined last year, 
the sporting arms output increased by 41 percent (42 percent of 
the total), and it is expected to increase by another 13 percent 
(to surpass 50 percent of total output). (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 2 May 94 p 2)

  EARLY IMF PAYMENT: The Czech Republic will make an early 
payment on the $430 million it owes the IMF for 1995, an advisor 
to the prime minister said today. Czech ministers met today to 
discuss the country's repayment of debt to the IMF, and decided 
to make the recommendation mainly because of the continuing 
growth of the Czech National Bank's foreign currency reserves. 
The advisor also said the ministers recommended that the 
government's export guarantee agency EGAP set up a subsidiary to 
function as an export bank. (Prague CTK in English 1747 GMT 3

  DENTAL INCREASES PRODUCTION: The profit of the state 
enterprise (dental products manufacturer) Dental (450 employees) 
surpassed Kc86 million (with total costs of Kc181 million) last 
year. The value of output increased by 18.4 percent with sales 
reaching almost Kc250 million. The book value of the enterprise 
is Kc195.6 million, and 39,883 shares (23 percent; 51 percent 
should go to Denfos Co., 10 percent to Jan Kricka, 10 percent to 
Health Insurance Co., 2 percent to employee shares and the rest 
to restitution funds) will go to the second wave of coupon 
privatization. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 3 May 94 p 10) 
  SELLIER, BELLOT PROFIT: The volume of sales of the Vlasim 
ammunition company, Sellier &amp; Bellot, reached approximately 
Kc700 million last year. The company profit was Kc80 million. 
This year's sales are expected to exceed Kc1 billion. 
Approximately 30 percent of the production is packaging 
machines particularly for food industry. At the time of 
privatization, the enterprise had debts of Kc27 million, but it 
is clear of debt now, under the new management and as a private 
company. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 3 May 94 p 14)

  TOURISM: According to the Czech Statistical Office, more 
than 16.41 million foreign tourists visited the Czech Republic 
in the first quarter of 1994. Of those, 12.5 million came from 
the neighboring countries, 73,000 from countries with visa 
obligation, and almost 3.84 million from other countries. Most 
of the tourists came from Germany (almost 9 million), the least 
from Slovakia (approximately 1.43 million. At the same time, 
almost 7.15 million Czechs travelled abroad. (Prague MLADA

  CEZ RATING, SALES: CEZ Co. (The Czech Power Generating 
Works) was rated BBB minus by Standard &amp; Poor's with a 
positive 
development. No Czech entity can be rated higher than BBB 
because that is the rating of the Czech National Bank. Last 
year's sales of CEZ totalled 48.5 billion korunas (Kc), pre-tax 
profit reached Kc17.5 billion, after-tax Kc7.5 billion. (Prague

  TRADE WITH UKRAINE, RUSSIA: According to Jan Hronek, 
Industry and Trade Ministry official, the volume of trade with 
all 15 former USSR republics amounted to $2.2 billion, of which 
the turnover of trade with Russia alone was worth $1.8 billion, 
with Ukraine $210 million, Kazakhstan $29 million, Belarus $23 
million, etc. The balance of trade with Ukraine improved last 
year, Hronek said, although it still shows a deficit (1993: 
exports -- $95.4 million, imports -- $114.4 million, deficit -- 
$19.0 million; 1992: exports -- $77.4 million, imports -- 
$127.8 million, deficit -- $50.4 million). The overall balance 
of trade with the former USSR republics shows a deficit that is 
concentrated in the trade with Russia and based mostly on 
energy-fuel substances, particularly crude oil. Regarding 
transport -- imports from Russia are covered by the Federation 
as far as the Czech border (ruble agreement), while the Czechs 
must pay for transport (transit through Ukraine) of their 
exports in convertible currency. Special clearing accounts are 
planned for trading with Ukraine (Ukrainian imports would be 
paid in korunas on a Czech bank account, from which exports to 
Ukraine would be paid). (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 4

  SECURITIES PRICES DROP: The official index of the Prague 
Securities Exchange, PX50, continues to fall. The index rose 
only when first introduced (by two points), and it has fallen 
ever since -- to 849.9 points on 3 May. (Prague DENNI TELEGRAF

  COMPANY TO BE LISTED: Ceska Zbrojovka Uhersky Brod, 
manufacturer of a large assortment of hand-held firearms 
(capital assets of Kc687 million, 2,700 employees), is soon to 
be listed on the exchange. The company's biggest problem is the 
shortage of production capacities. It invested approximately 
Kc500 million in modernization of its equipment over the past 
five years, and another Kc200-300 million is to be invested in 
the next two years (this does not include any expansion). The 
output doubled in comparison with 1989 to reach sales of Kc940 
million (almost 80 percent for exports) last year. The company 
is 53.1 percent owned by privatization funds, 21.4 percent by 
individual shareholders, and approximately 22.5 percent will be 
privatized in the second wave of privatization. (Prague RUDE

  MANUFACTURER FOCUSES ON EXPORTS: Vulkan Hradek nad Nisou 
intends to export as much as 50 percent of its output. This 
year, its foreign trade turnover will be in excess of Kc110 
million. This company, with a profit last year of Kc12.5 
million, is being privatized in the second privatization wave.

  UK TRADE TIES: British commentators consider the Czech 
Republic an "outpost" of free market democracy in the changing 
Central and Eastern European region. Nevertheless, the Czech 
Republic's trade with Great Britain lags behind its trade with 
other Western countries. Last year its deficit with Great 
Britain reached 40 million pounds sterling. If Czech sources 
show a surplus of 45 million pounds, it is because they include 
goods and services that go on to other countries after reaching 
London. British companies are seventh on the ladder of foreign 
investors, having put about 80 million pounds into Czech 
companies since 1989. However, this sum does not include 
investments mediated by international banks and financial 
institutions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development. Some British projects in the Czech Republic, such 
as the purchase of 34 percent of the shares in Prague Breweries 
for 9 million pounds by the British company Bass, have provoked 
the criticism of independent economists for their allegedly low 
prices. The British Government supports the opening of Western 
markets for goods from Central and Eastern Europe, but at the 
same time it protects its labor market relatively strictly. 
Only around 400 work permits were issued to Czech citizens last 
year, although according to unofficial estimates there are about 
another 3,000 Czechs working illegally in Britain. In an 
attempt to protect the British market from illegal workers, each 
year the British authorities refuse entry to several hundred 
people coming from the Czech Republic as tourists. (Prague CTK 
in English 1202 GMT 5 May 94) Czech exports (55 percent 
machines and transport equipment) to Great Britain rose by 98 
percent, imports (47 percent machines and transport equipment, 
21 percent chemicals) by 22.2 percent. While the trade deficit 
was $69.9 million in 1992, there was a surplus of $68.6 million 
in 1993. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 5 May 94 p 8) 
  SKODA LOSS, INCREASED SALES: The auto maker Skoda Mlada 
Boleslav has shown a Kc4.3 billion (about $143 million) loss for 
last year, according to the year-end statement approved by its 
shareholders at a general meeting on 5 May. The meeting took 
place to complete the one from April 15. A statement issued from 
the original meeting says that the loss was caused mainly by "a 
change in the Czech Republic's accounting system, which occurred 
in 1993 when its methods were adapted to international 
standards." If the results had been evaluated according to the 
original method, Skoda would have shown a profit of 8 million 
marks, the statement says. The shareholders also expressed 
contentment with the VW management's confirmation on May 3 that 
it would soon begin investing in the production of a new 
medium-category Skoda model. The new model seemed to be 
threatened since the world banks' loan to Skoda was canceled and 
VW investment reduced last year as VW ran into financial 
difficulties. The shareholders praised the increase in Skoda's 
1993 production and sales of about 10 percent to almost 220,000 
cars amid the general decline in sales on world markets as well 
as the cars' higher quality. They stressed Skoda's importance 
for domestic suppliers, whose share of contracts will remain the 
same. (Prague CTK in English 1844 GMT 5 May 94) Skoda has sold 
4,100 cars in Britain so far this year, four times the figure 
for the same period last year. Robin Woollcock, director of 
Skoda Automobile U.K., said dealers are very satisfied with the 
current models available, and are not overly impatient for the 
Czech manufacturer's new model, expected after 1995. Skoda's 
Favorit starts at 5,600 pounds. Overall car sales in Britain 
were up 14 percent this year over last. Sales of other 
manufacturers in the Volkswagen group, which owns 31 percent of 
Skoda, ranged from 4,330 for Spain's Seat to 26,300 for 
Volkswagen cars. (Prague CTK in English 1147 GMT 10 May 94) 
  PRIVATIZATION STATISTICS: A total of 1.8 million citizens 
participated in the first round of the second wave of coupon 
privatization on April 11-25, Jaroslav Lizner, director of the 
Coupon Privatization Center, said today. They submitted 
2,154,755 coupons with 5,064,246 orders, he added. Of the 353 
registered investment and mutual funds, only 13 did not take 
part in the first round. Funds had 3.9 billion investment 
points and individual investors 2.3 billion. The final results 
of the first round and new share prices will be published May 19 
in the center's regular guide, Lizner said. The following day 
this data will be available on diskettes and at registration 
sites as well. Coupon investment holders will be sent letters 
containing the results of their orders between May 16 and 20. 
Funds have been using property obtained in the first wave as 
collateral for loans from banks, according to Marie Jezkova of 
the Finance Ministry. That is a serious violation of the law 
and an irresponsible way to use the property of investors, and 
it is sad that banks accept such guarantees, she said. The 
Coupon Privatization Center will no longer offer services not 
required under the Securities Act as of September 1994, Lizner 
announced. (Prague CTK in English 1931 GMT 5 May 94)

  INCREASED STAKE IN CMZRB: The Czech-Moravian Warranty and 
Development Bank (CMZRB) will increase its capital stock from 
Kc305 million to 500 million as required by the new Czech 
National Bank regulations. The government passed a motion on 4 
May, according to which it will increase its stake -- through 
the Ministry of the Economy -- by Kc136.7 million to hold 49 
percent -- as compared with the present 33 percent - stake in 
the Ceskomoravska Zarucni a Rozvojova Banka. The remaining 
capital will be raised through redistribution of the bank's 1993 
profit. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 6 May 94 p 2) 
  AGRICULTURAL PRIVATIZATION: According to the Land Fund 
budget 
report, the overall revenue from the privatization of the state 
agricultural holdings currently administered by the Land Funds 
are expected to bring in approximately Kc23.5 billion. On the 
liabilities side, expenditures (unsettled claims, debts, etc.) 
are expected to reach Kc17 billion. This year the privatization 
of farm property should yield Kc3.035 billion. This reckoning 
does not, however, take into account that the buyers use a 
long-term (20 year) payments purchase scheme, or that many 
lessees do not (are not able to) pay their rent. (Prague

Offices of the two republics, the growth of prices continued in

  AMMUNITION MANUFACTURE: The Sellier &amp; Bellot Co. of 
Vlasim 
(2,300 employees) does not intend ever to revive its production 
of military ammunition to the pre-1989 volume. The chairman of 
the board said that it is even no longer technically possible. 
In 1989, most of the output was military ammunition for the 
Czechoslovak Army and engineering products for the USSR. Today, 
97 percent of the munitions produced consists of ammunition for 
sporting and hunting arms. With some items, handgun cartridges, 
for instance, they cannot even satisfy the demand. The 
production of military ammunition is minimal. The latest 
addition in this sphere are special NATO standard cartridges. 
The firm is prepared to supply the Czech Army with that 
ammunition if the Army is rearmed. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in

  MINING ACTIVITY DROPS: Since 1989, the extraction of most 
minerals has dropped 30 to 40 percent, Economy Minister Karel 
Dyba announced on 9 May. The drop in extraction is attributable 
to a certain extent to a drop in exports, he added. The 
extraction of raw materials for bricks and other construction 
materials decreased the most. Those materials, after brown 
coal, are mined in the greatest volume in the Czech Republic. 
On January 1 of this year, the extraction of ore (tin, lead, 
zinc, copper, silver, and gold) ceased. By the end of 1994, 
fluorite and baryte will also no longer be mined. On the other 
hand, the extraction of oil, china clay, and feldspar has 
increased. Mineral reserves vary from 30 years for uranium ore 
to 1,380 years for china clay, he concluded. (Prague CTK in

  BANK HOLDING PRECIOUS STONES: Investicni a Postovni Banka 
(IPB) is holding precious stones received as a Kc750 million 
loan payment, whose market value is a quarter of that, MLADA 
FRONTA DNES reported today, citing unnamed sources. The daily 
cited a source close to the bank and another from the Czech 
intelligence service, both of whom asked not to be named due to 
bank secrecy provisions. A bank spokesman said only that the 
topic was highly confidential but that officials denied the 
existence of any such valuables. IPB, the fourth largest 
banking house in the country, allegedly received the stones, 
which come from Africa and the former USSR, from several 
customers over a year ago. It has since tried to sell them 
several times without success. Both sources also claimed the 
existence of similar holdings by other banks. A spokeswoman of 
one of these, Komercni banka, refused to comment on the claims. 
Police and the Czech Economic Interests Protection Service both 
have information on precious-stones trading. The director of the 
government agency, Jan Sula, said banks accepted them as loan 
collateral in the past, but that it was unlikely they would 
continue the practice. (Prague CTK in English 1144 GMT 10 May

The City Council has decided not to take out a Kc950 million 
loan from Ceska Sporitelna as planned, he added, but will make 
use of the aforementioned sum to fund its projects. The first 
three projects have been approved. The city will put Kc2.1 
billion into road repairs, Kc1 billion into the extension of the 
metro (subway) system, and Kc300 million into purchasing 
property, Koukal specified. Further projects will be discussed 
in late May. The city had a budget surplus of Kc22 million for

committee requested a report from the Presidential Office 
explaining what measures it will take to make good the budget 
losses. The NKU claims costs of Kc83,000 ($2,800) were not 
documented in the stipulated manner. Among other things certain 
catering expenses were not covered in accordance with the 
regulations and three personal vehicles given to the Office as a

first quarter of 1994. That is an increase of 39 percent in 
comparison with the same period last year. At the same time, 
spending of Czech tourists travelling abroad increased by 34 
percent to reach $175 million. The surplus for the first three 
months of the year is $150 million, almost 50 percent more than 
last year. According to the Statistical Office, 16.5 million 
visitors arrived in the Czech Republic in the first quarter (23 
percent more than last year), of which 2.6 million were

  AVIATION INDUSTRY: The economy ministers recently approved 
the method of consolidation of the Aero aviation holding that 
also solves the difficulties of all its subsidiaries (Motorlet, 
Moravan, and Let Kunovice). According to Minister Dlouhy, 
negotiations are in progress with the Canadian firm Pratt &amp; 
Whitney regarding the purchase of Motorlet (there are two other 
interested parties). Meanwhile, Aero is preparing a project for 
consolidation of Motorlet with the Ceska Sporitelna and other 
banks for the possibility that the offers are not accepted. If 
talks with investors fail, the Investicni a Postovni Banka will 
purchase 100 percent of the Moravan shares at nominal price. 
Moreover, the bank will waive punitive interest charges 
retrospectively to 31 January 1994. That alone covers 
approximately one-third of Aero debt to the IPB. In the 
instance of Let Kunovice, the talks with foreign partners were 
halted. We are contemplating a consolidation similar to that of 
Motorlet, and possibly without a foreign partner. Hence, no 
bankruptcy should occur in aviation industry. The CKD Prague 
holding is the first industrial giant to be consolidated by a 
public tender. So far, eight bidders demonstrated interest in 
the purchase of majority stake in the company. Of course, the 
price is only one of the criteria. (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES in

  TATRA LOSSES: The Tatra Koprivnice car and truck

the losses more than quadrapled since 1992, when the loss was 
just Kc0.5 billion. The firm sold 117 more trucks last year 
than in 1992, and exports surpassed 93 percent of total sales. 
Nonetheless, the truck production declined to 2,950 units. The 
management plans for marketing the trucks in Italy and Spain 
have not been realized, and the car manufacture was transformed 
to custom production (98 cars were assembled). The company 
plans to market 4,500 trucks and 150 cars in 1994. (Prague

Frydlant. This firm was a center of police attention before -- 
when it attempted illegal export of five Soviet-made helicopters 
to Yugoslavia. The financial institutions that accepted the 
stones as a collateral a year ago based the value of the pledge 
on false expert evaluation. As a result they lost tens of 
millions of korunas. The original owner of the aforementioned 
helicopters was a Moscow firm Berkut that also deals in precious 
stones. (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES in Czech 12 May 94 p 1)

  MINISTER ON TRADE DEFICIT: The foreign trade deficit that 
the Czech Republic ran at the end of the first three months of 
this year is not dramatic, Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir 
Dlouhy told journalists on 12 May. Czech exports fell almost 5 
percent against the same period last year, whereas imports grew 
16 percent, Dlouhy said, hinting that the figures reflected 
imports of technology, considered normal for a country 
undergoing transformation. Exports to Slovakia have recently 
continued to fall, he said, and currently stands at two- thirds 
of the level a year ago. Czech exports in 1993 reached $12.8 
million and imports $12.5 million but this year may be 
different, Dlouhy said. Czech exports in the first three months 
of this year excluding those to Slovakia went up 4.1 percent and 
imports excluding those from Slovakia went up 24.5 percent. The 
ministry intends to launch a consulting centre to help Czech 
exporters, Dlouhy said. (Prague CTK in English 1425 GMT 12 May

  ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION: Average per capita electricity 
consumption in the Czech Republic has been steadily increasing, 
Erik Schmidt of the CEZ power generating works said on 12 May. 
It has risen from 676 kwh in 1983 to 1,068 kwh last year, an 
increase of 58 percent, he specified. Last year, CEZ and 
distribution companies supplied 41.163 gwh, a drop of 0.6 
percent compared to 1992. Supplies from the very high voltage 
network decreased 4.8 percent over the preceding year to 23.809 
gwh. On the other hand, supplies from the low voltage network 
increased 5.7 percent to 17.354 gwh. Increased supplies from the 
low voltage network is attributable mainly to household energy 
consumption, which totalled 11.107 gwh last year, 7.4 percent 
more than in 1992. Household electricity consumption 
represented 27 percent of total consumption last year. 
"Consumption in households is expected to further increase 
because people are using more and more household appliances. 
That is why energy conserving appliances should be promoted," 
Erik Schmidt stated. (Prague CTK in English 2012 GMT 12 May 94) 
  GERMANS BUY PLANTS: The government acknowledged on 11 May 
the sale of a part of the Pal Prague property to the German 
company VDO Schindling. The company will purchase for Kc50 
million (129 percent of book value) the car control board gauges 
assembly plant in Prague and the Adrspach plant prior to 
implementation of the privatization project. The German firm 
also promises to invest 5.5 million German marks in the plants 
before 1998. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 13 May 94 p 2) 
  EXPORT BANK FOUNDED: The general meeting on 12 May of the 
Export, Guarantee, and Insurance Co. (EGAP) decided to found the 
Czech Export Bank. The bank is to provide advantageous credits 
for financing export operations. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 13 
May 94 p 3) 
  EXPORTS TO SLOVAKIA DECLINE: The full effect of the 
devaluation of Slovak currency is only now being felt. In the 
first quarter of 1994, Czech exports to Slovakia declined by 
33.5 percent in comparison with the same period last year. 
(Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 13 May 94 p 8) 
  RUSSIAN OIL DRILLING: Kokes, director of Plzen Inwest 
Leasing Co., signed an agreement in Moscow on 12 May on 
developing and expanding the oil drilling project of the 
Russian-Czech joint venture (of Plzen private Inwest Leasing Co. 
and Russian state enterprise Udmurtneft) Ural Inwest Oil 
Corporation (UIOC). The corporation has 112 producing wells and 
supplies oil to the Czech Republic. (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES in 
Czech 14 May 94 p 14) 
  BANK BUSINESS AS USUAL: With the exception of the AB Bank, 
Bohemia Bank, and Kreditni Bank there has not been a run on any 
bank in the Czech Republic. There is no significant increase in 
withdrawals or deposits at any of the banks surveyed following 
the collapse of the three aforementioned banks. (Prague LIDOVE 
NOVINY in Czech 14 May 94 p 12) 
  FEAR OF COLLAPSE: The fears expressed by Bohemian-Moravian 
Center Party (CMSS) Chairman Jan Krycer, that more small banks 
may collapse, could be justified if they stick to the ways of 
the collapsed Credit and Industrial, Bohemia and AB banks, Czech 
Social Democratic Party (CSSD) Deputy Chairman Vaclav Grulich 
told journalists on 16 May. If they get into difficulties, the 
least they can expect is "stricter control by the Czech National 
Bank, so that the spots that are beginning to show do not 
produce a domino effect," Grulich said, adding that people with 
small accounts and trades people would be most hurt. "It shows 
that the there is a lot of foul play in our economy with the 
dirt going deeper and reaching into the banking sphere. We lack 
thorough and well-devised inspection," Grulich said. He also 
called for a thorough and nonpartisan inspection of the National 
Property Fund (FNM) and criticized the government for allowing 
the continuation of "scandalous imports" of heating oil and its 
sale by unscrupulous entrepreneurs at a profit running into 
billions of korunas, which ought to have gone to the state. 
(Prague CTK in English 1229 GMT 16 May 94) 
  FIRST ROUND PRIVATIZATION: According to a Finance Ministry 
report, 20.94 million shares (13.51 percent of the total of 155 
million 1,000- koruna shares of 861 companies) were sold in the 
first round of the second wave of coupon privatization. Of this 
amount, investment privatization funds obtained 15.44 million 
and individual investors 5.5 million shares. Demand exceeded 
supply by 129 companies. In 15 instances the orders could be 
reduced, i.e., the sale was completed. Of the total number of 
investment points, 5.61 billion, or 91.08 percent, have been 
invested in the first round. (Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 14

  ENTERPRISE INSOLVENCY: At the beginning of April, 61 percent 
of the surveyed 757 industrial enterprises were insolvent. 
(Prague CESKY DENIK in Czech 14 May 94 p 14) 
  VITKOVICE INCREASES EXPORTS: Vitkovice Co. is successful in 
gradually increasing its exports of rolled steel. Only exports 
of thick sheets to Germany reached 24,000 metric tons in the 
first quarter. This enterprise is among the largest exporters of 
metallurgical products in the entire former Eastern bloc. An 
important market for Vitkovice is also the United States, where 
the company managed to sell 10,000 metric tons of sheets by the 
end of March. Based on signed contracts, exports to Croatia 
should reach 35,000 metric tons of rolled material before the 
end of the year. Vitkovice was also successful in Poland, 
Austria, Sweden, Netherlands, and Belgium. Exports of sheet 
pile -- particularly to Netherlands -- are expected to grow 
further, and there is a great demand for the so-called IPE 
profiles (which are price-wise very attractive for the 
enterprise). (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 17 May 94 KORUNA 
supplement p viii) 
  HOP MARKET THREATENED: The Czech Republic cultivates 
approximately 6.5 percent of the total world area of 
hop-gardens. Hop production is 2.5 percent of all crop farming 
in the country. Approximately one-third of the crop is sold on 
the domestic market. Because of the subsidies in EU countries, 
however, marketing difficulties are expected. In addition, 
fewer hops are needed in beer production because of the modern 
technology, and cheap hop concentrates are also becoming more 
readily available. (Prague DENNI TELEGRAF in Czech 18 May 94 p 
8) 
  POWER, GAS PRICES: On 1 June, prices of electric power and 
gas supplied to households will increase by an average of 10 
percent. In addition, the prices of solid fuel, completely 
liberated on May 1, might also increase. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in 
Czech 18 May 94 pp 1, 2) 
  FARM DEBT ALLOCATION: The government allocated Kc7 billion 
($230 million) to cover the debts of the "residual state farms" 
from the budget of the National Property Fund (FNM), Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus told journalists after the government 
session on 18 May. He said that this sort of debt repayment 
from the FNM funds had occurred only in agriculture. On the 
other hand, the sum will alleviate the banking sphere, to which 
some of the irrecoverable credits will be paid back, Klaus 
added. (Prague CTK in English 1720 GMT 18 May 94) 
  LOCAL PRIVATIZATION: MLADA FRONTA DNES comments on Czech 
ministers' decision to turn down foreign investors and prefer 
local companies in the privatization of refineries. "Analysts 
from large consultation companies will now have enough stuff to 
think about. If the government followed this pattern, the 
season of great deals would end for them. But Tuesday's (17 
May) move by economy ministers is a real breakthrough at first 
sight only. The state has been making it apparent for a long 
time now that it wants to maintain control of the fundamental 
chemical industry. It is a most important strategic branch -- 
especially until the country is more self-assured and becomes 
independent of supplies from the unstable Russia. That is also 
why the government has offered guarantees for the oil pipeline 
from Ingolstadt (Bavaria, to Kralupy nad Vltavou, central 
Bohemia, to be completed by 1996). This is also the main reason 
why it has not allowed strong foreign capital to enter the 
refineries," the paper writes. (Prague CTK in English 2244 GMT 
18 May 94) 
  SPAS DIVIDENDS: The largest fund of the first wave of 
privatization, the Saving Privatization Co. (SPAS) achieved a 
net profit of Kc693 million and will pay a dividend of Kc25 per 
share (after tax). Since 20 shares were issued per coupon book 
(purchased for Kc1,000), it means a dividend of Kc500 per book. 
This was decided by the general meeting of shareholders on 18 
May. The Fund obtained in the first wave investment points from 
1,035,000 shareholders and invested them in 514 companies. The 
market value of this property amounted to Kc18.5 billion at the 
end of the year, or Kc927 per share. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in 
Czech 19 May 94 p 2) 
  FINANCE GROUP: The Ceska Pojistovna Co. (Czech Insurance 
Co.) Group is the name of the finance group founded by the Ceska 
Pojistovna Co. with its major subsidiaries (Kapitalova 
Investicni Co., Alpha Broker Co., Pragobanka Co., Ceska 
Pojistovna Slovensko, Ceska Pojistovna Zdravi Co., and Ceska 
Pojistovna Pension Fund). The equity of the group exceeds Kc1.7 
billion, capital stock reaches approximately Kc57 billion. 
(Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 20 May 94 p 2) 
  MINISTER'S AGRICULTURE REPORT: The agricultural sector made 
a loss of Kc9.7 billion (about $323 million) in 1993 as 
expected, according to the Report on the State of Czech 
Agriculture in 1993, Agriculture Minister Josef Lux said on 20 
May. Of that figure, accounting losses connected to the farms 
that inherited the majority of debts from the former state farms 
after privatization represent 30 percent; therefore, real losses 
amount to Kc6 billion, he explained. The share of agriculture 
in gross domestic product has been steadily decreasing. Last 
year it was 5 percent. Agricultural production is dropping 
slightly; last year it was 0.8 percent lower than the year 
before. Animal products output was 6.1 percent lower, while 
vegetable products output was 6.4 percent higher. Last year 56 
percent of agricultural enterprises were loss-making. The 10.6 
percent increase in work productivity over 1992 is attributable 
to the lower number of workers. Workers in the agricultural 
sector earn on average 85 percent of what industrial workers 
make. Last year it became more difficult to obtain loans for 
agriculture, and the total value of loans issued for that sector 
was 14 percent lower than in 1992. The private sector's share 
in primary agricultural production was 77 percent last year. 
Private entities established during the period of economic 
transformation cultivated 85 percent of land; 67 percent of land 
was cultivated by private legal entities and 18 percent by 
individuals. The share of agriculture, including fishing and 
forestry, in employment was 6.4 percent, half of the 1989 share. 
Lux said that the lack of financial resources to complete the 
restructuring process and to boost competitiveness was still a 
major problem. The share of agriculture in total investment has 
been decreasing; in 1993 it was 3.8 percent. Lux said that the 
privatization of agriculture was continuing, but that the 
transformation of ownership relations has not yet been 
completed. In 1993, 919 privatization projects for 85 percent of 
the property to be privatized were approved. The number of 
landowners is many times higher than the number of 
entrepreneurial entities, which means that most entrepreneurs 
cultivate rented land. The share of rented land in total 
acreage is 60 percent. Private enterprises in the Czech 
Republic are about 10 times larger than in the European Union; 
their average acreage is 135 hectares, excluding entities 
cultivating less than one hectare. (Prague CTK in English 2021 
GMT 20 May 94) 
  APRIL INDUSTRIAL PRICES: Industrial prices continued to 
increase marginally in April. The month-to-month pace in 
individual sectors hovered between 0.4 and 1.5 percent. The 
slightest was the increase in prices of industrial manufacturers 
(0.4 percent), while the prices of construction work (up 1.2 
percent) and water (1.5 percent) rose the most. The increase 
from the beginning of the year was 2.4 percent in industrial 
manufacturers' prices, and 4.8 percent in construction. A 
significant increase was registered by water (up approx. 16 
percent) and freight transport (8.3 percent) -- mostly because 
of the hefty increase in the first months of the year. In 
comparison with the same period last year, the industrial 
manufacturers' prices rose 4.9 percent, construction work 16.1 
percent (although prices of construction material increased by 
only 6 percent), prices of communications rose by 28.2 percent, 
and water by 40 percent. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 23 
May 94 p 7) 
  SKODA RETURNS TO IRAN: The Skoda Diesel Co. signed a Kc10 
million contract on a supply of diesel aggregates. At the same 
time, negotiations continue regarding delivery of another Kc100 
million worth of diesel aggregates. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 
23 May 94 p 12) 
  FREIGHT DECLINE: Over the first three months of the year, 
the volume of goods conveyed by public freight transport 
declined by 7 percent in comparison with the same period last 
year. A total of 43.417 million metric tons of cargo (62.1 
percent railroad, and 35.8 percent road transport). The 
railroad is mostly responsible for the decline (15.9 percent 
less cargo than a year ago -- the volume of river transport 
declined 16.1 percent but it conveyed only 2.1 percent of the 
total cargo). (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 23 May 94 p 12) 
  EBRD SHAREHOLDER IN KAROSA: The traditional domestic bus 
manufacturer, Karosa Vysoke Myto (1,750 employees, sales of more 
than Kc2 billion in 1993), transferred 181,145 new shares to the 
account of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
(EBRD). Thus, the bank, which paid more than Kc200 million for 
its stake, becomes 17-percent owner of the vehicle manufacturing 
firm. The capital stock of the company has now reached Kc1.065 
billion. The main shareholder is the French Renault Vehicules 
Industriels S.A. with 34 percent (which should eventually 
acquire 51 percent majority). (Prague MLADA FRONTA DNES in 
Czech 24 May 94 p 13) 
  FARM PRICES UP: Agricultural manufacturers' prices rose in 
April by 4.4 percent in comparison with the same period last 
year. Prices of vegetable products including fruit and 
vegetables declined by 16.3 percent, prices of animal products 
rose by 6.5 percent. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 24 May 
94 p 2) 
  MORAVIAN AIR CARRIER: The Air Ostrava Co. was officially 
introduced on 23 May as the new owner of Air Vitkovice (formerly 
Air Transport Co. Vitkovice). The new owner purchased 100 
percent of the firm at the end of April. It currently employs a 
staff of 37 and operates three scheduled links (Ostrava- Prague, 
Prague-Nuremberg, and Ostrava-Vienna). The company's largest 
problem is at present its aircraft pool (five 15-seat aircraft 
with 700 km flight range). Over the next three years, Air 
Ostrava will invest $15 million in the expansion and 
modernization of the company's equipment. (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 24 May 94 p 2) 
  EXPORTS TO LATIN AMERICA: The managers of Prerov Engineering 
Works, CZ Strakonice, and LIAZ used the recent 10-day Czech 
business mission to sign contracts with partners in Argentina, 
Chile, and Brazil. For LIAZ, Latin America is a traditional 
partner. The company signed contracts to deliver 40 vehicles to 
Argentina, 120 to Chile, and there are good prospects for 
additional contracts. LIAZ expect to place 12 percent of its 
output -- or approximately $8 million worth of goods -- on Latin 
American markets. This year, the expected total sales should 
reach 1,500 vehicles (4,500 engines should be manufactured by 
the end of the year) and the value of the sales should reach 
Kc2.5 billion. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 24 May 94 p 6) 
  KAUCUK PROFIT: The petrochemicals products manufacturer 
Kaucuk Co. Kralupy made a profit of almost 541 million korunas 
(Kc) in the first quarter, which is approximately 7 percent more 
than in the same period last year. The Kaucuk earnings amounted 
to more than Kc3.66 billion with costs exceeding Kc3.12 billion. 
The results are based on fuel production (60.8 percent), 
polystyrene goods production (19.2 percent), power (10 percent), 
and rubber (7.2 percent). (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 
25 May 94 p 2) 
  SKODA DIESEL STOCK: The general meeting of Skoda Diesel 
shareholders on 24 May approved a Kc53 million increase of the 
company capital stock by means of a non-financial investment of 
Skoda Plzen represented by the Skoda trademark. The increase is 
in fact compensation for the license fee. (Prague HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Czech 25 May 94 p 2) 
  HOUSING CONSTRUCTION: There were only 7,454 housing starts 
in the republic in 1993, 11.6 percent down on a year earlier. 
Moreover, individual construction is responsible for 91.5 
percent of them. There are only 350 cooperative housing unit 
starts on record for 1993 (4.7 percent of housing starts) and 
192 community units (2.6 percent). The declining trend was also 
apparent in completed housing -- a total of 31,509 units was 
completed, i.e., 13.4 percent fewer than in 1992 (9,606 
cooperative units -- 36.4 percent drop, 621.3 community units -- 
12.3 percent decline). In individual construction, on the other 
hand, the number of completed units rose by 14.5 percent to 
14,316 units. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 25 May 94 KORUNA

  CSOB CUTS RATES: On 1 June, the Czechoslovak International 
Trade Bank (CSOB) reduces its interest rate on practically all 
koruna term deposits, many foreign currency deposits, and 
several types of current account deposits (from 2.5 to 2.0 
percent). On the other hand, it increases the rate of interest 
paid on U.S. and Canadian $ accounts. (Prague HOSPODARSKE

  SLOVAK DEFICIT BALANCE: The deficit balance on the clearing 
account for trade with Slovakia reached Kc243 million (7.2 
million ECU) on 24 May. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 26 May 
94 KORUNA supplement p i) 
  RUSSIAN TRADE: The conditions for trade with Russia are not 
improving. Thus, any improvement in trade is due to the Czech 
firms having learned to better apply barter trade, accept 
payments in rubles, etc. Exports of equipment for the gas and 
oil industry is advantageous but the Russians have no money for 
payments. Exports to Russia amounted to Kc2,683 million in the 
first quarter, while imports reached Kc11,532 million. (Prague 
LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 26 May 94 KORUNA supplement p i) 
  EU ANTI-DUMPING PROCEDURES: The European Commission started 
anti-dumping procedures against the imports of foundry pig iron 
from the Czech Republic, HOSPODARSKE NOVINY reported on 27 May. 
Jiri Vavra from the Czech mission to the European Union in 
Brussels confirmed the news on 26 May to the paper, stressing 
that the commission had not yet officially informed the Czech 
side about the move and that the Czechs had learned about it 
from the commission's official bulletin. He said that the 
procedures were opened on the initiative of Eurofontes, the 
European association of foundry companies. The commission thus 
expanded its previously started procedures against Brazil, 
Poland, Russia and Ukraine. Eurofontes has sent a complaint to 
the commission, pointing out that imports of the Czech foundry 
pig iron are effected at substantially lower prices than 
production costs plus an adequate profit. It does not specify 
the value of the dumping but says that the Czech prices were 
about one-third of the EU ones. Eurofontes also argues that the 
Czech Republic was not exporting pig iron to the European Union 
before 1991, while in 1992 its exports to EU represented 4,316 
metric tons and in the first seven months of the last year even 
8,826 metric tons. Czech exports in the first quarter of this 
year were around 8,000 metric tons. The Czech share in the 
foundry pig iron market thus increased from zero to 2.4 percent 
in less than three years and on the German market even to almost 
10 percent. Eurofontes does not name any specific exporter, but 
sources close to the Czech mission do not exclude that the 
company in question is Vitkovice of Ostrava. It has been lately 
the only company which started exporting foundry pig iron. Most 
steel companies are avoiding exports of the semi- completed 
product because it has low added value. The Czech mission 
protested the European Commission's procedures through the Joint 
Czech-EU Committee, saying that the move went counter to the 
1991 Preliminary Agreement because that document preferred 
bilateral talks to opening anti-dumping procedures. This is the 
second anti-dumping procedure against the Czech Republic started 
in a short period of time. Czech representatives in Brussels 
believe that the exporters should be more disciplined and focus 
rather on long-term targets than on immediate profits. The daily 
has learned that further anti-dumping procedures may hit Czech 
exporters, this time those of steel tubes and possibly steel 
profiles. (Prague CTK in English 1251 GMT 27 May 94) 
  UNHARVESTED GRAIN: Czech farmers received in April 
approximately Kc1 billion from the government for 500,000 metric 
tons of so far unharvested grain for the period for which they 
signed contracts. The agriculture ministry also intends to 
introduce a "hill farming subsidy" this year. According to this 
program, the farms in mountainous regions, which would grow 
grass on some of the land, would receive between Kc1,000 and 
2,500 per hectare annually, provided their is no increase in 
milk production. (Prague LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 30 May 94 
KORUNA supplement p i) 
  STRAKONICE DIVIDENDS: The general meeting of shareholders of 
CZ Strakonice approved dividends in the amount of Kc17 million, 
or Kc10 per share. The company also reported that its long-term 
obligations were reduced from Kc13.5 million to Kc4.1 million, 
and the short-term ones from Kc353.1 million to Kc229.6 million. 
1993 net profit of CZ amounted to Kc27.268 million. (Prague 
LIDOVE NOVINY in Czech 30 May 94 KORUNA supplement p i) 
  BANK CAPITAL, PROFIT: The general meeting of shareholders of 
the Kreditni Banka Co. Plzen approved the issue of new shares to 
increase the company capital stock by Kc400 million. The 
company capital stock is expected to reach Kc1.51 billion within 
two years. Last year's disposable profit exceeded Kc83 million 
(2.5 times more than in 1992), and Kc60 million will be paid out 
in dividends. (Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech 30 May 94 p 2) 
  COAL PRICES UP: After the deregulation of solid fuel prices 
on 1 May, in many places, prices of coke and black coal went up 
(as much as 20 percent). On the other hand, the prices of brown 
coal (lignite) did not change, and the brown coal is often sold 
at a discount. (Prague RUDE PRAVO in Czech 30 May 94 p 3) 
  TRANSEUROPEAN RAIL SYSTEM: Transport Minister Jan Strasky 
signed an agreement on a trans-European railway system (TER) in 
Geneva on 29 May, HOSPODARSKE NOVINY daily reports on 30 May. 
The project, worked out by the United Nations' Economic 
Commission for Europe, aims to improve the quality and 
effectiveness of international railways, set up a combined 
transport network in the postcommunist countries and upgrade 
links to the West. The project also strives to extend and 
improve the present infrastructure, modernize transport control 
and signalling systems, and adapt railway management to the 
demands of the free market economy, the paper writes. (Prague 
CTK in English 0825 GMT 30 May 94) 
  TEXTILE JOINT VENTURE: One of the largest domestic producers 
of technical textiles, the Technolen Lomnice nad Popelkou 
company, is establishing a joint venture with two foreign 
partners. One of the partners is a Belgian industrial investor, 
Wittock, and the other one is a British investment fund, 
Fleming. The two of them will jointly hold 45.9 percent of the 
company and the stake of the shareholders from the first wave of 
coupon privatization, management, and their co-investors will be 
"diluted" by this issue. Company Director Josef Subrt believes 
that the financial situation of the company will improve and 
that the new firm, Technolen WF, will be able to invest in the 
modernization of production. The management turned to foreign 
investors because a long-term loan could not be obtained in the 
republic. Technolen WF should obtain a loan of $10 million 
probably in June. Moreover, the company will obtain from 
Wittock the production program of the closed plant in Belgium as 
well as some of the machinery. "We will most probably 
participate in government orders," J. Subrt said. [Prague

  STATE ASSETS PRIVATIZED: By the end of last year, only 15 
percent of the state assets of 430 billion forints (HUF) held by 
the State Property Agency (AVU) and the State Holding Company's 
HUF1,400 billion had been privatized, according to a recent 
report by the independent research organization Kopint-Datorg. 
Last year's income from privatization was HUF77.9 billion, 
slightly up on 1992's HUF74.6 billion. Of the 1993 income, 
however, the proportion of foreign investment was only 
one-third, as compared to 55 percent in 1992, and the cash 
element in the total income figure fell from 85 percent to 55 
percent. Preferential payment forms (for example, privatization 
leasing) accounted for 45 percent of the total income in 1993, 
compared with only 15 percent in the previous year. The report 
states that preferential payment schemes have created problems 
for companies privatized in this way; creating uncertainty over 
their future and failing to provide secure long-term successful 
operations. State assets to a book value of HUF152.8 billion 
were privatized between 1990 and 1992 and the privatization 
income in this period was around two-thirds of book value. The 
book value of privatized state assets last year was HUF127.8 
billion, but the privatization income was only 55 percent of 
this figure. The continued operation of state- owned companies 
is becoming increasingly expensive and company assets worth 
HUF67.2 billion were sold off in 1993. AVU expenditure on 
various guarantees amounted to HUF5.7 billion in 1993 and this 
amount is projected to rise to HUF15 billion in the 1994 
Property Policy Guidelines. Although AVU expenditure on company 
reorganization and guarantees is classified as the 
redistribution of privatization revenues, Kopint-Datorg argues 
that it is paradoxical that privatization incomes are in effect 
being use to increase the state's control over state-owned

  NATIONAL BANK BALANCE: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) 
closed last year with a balance-sheet total of HUF3,468.8 
billion, 29 percent up on the previous year. MNB revenues of 
HUF236.3 billion and expenditures of HUF223.4 billion resulted 
in pre-tax profit of HUF12.82 billion, which was HUF3.9 billion 
more than last year. After-tax profits were HUF2.5 billion. 
The above figures were published at MNB's general assembly on 
29 April. The bank's results are closely linked with Hungary's 
economic situation. Last year's processes exhibited differences 
from the original plan, with a fall in exports and a 9 percent 
rise in domestic consumption. After a decline lasting years, 
industrial output increased by 4 percent; agricultural 
production continued to decrease, reaching 6 percent; gross 
domestic product fell by 0-2 percent. Last year the MNB and the 
government devalued the forint in five stages, by a total of 15 
percent. The international basic balance, that is the balance 
of the current account, net borrowings, repayments, and working 
capital investments, showed a surplus of $755 million in 1992, 
and $2.2 billion in 1993. At the same time, the current account 
last year dipped $3.5 billion into the red. In 1993, foreign 
resources of $4.4 billion were mobilized through 16 bond issues, 
and $2.3 billion working capital arrived in the country, with 
the total amount considerably exceeding debt-repayment 
obligations. The country had net debts of $14.9 billion at the 
end of 1993, an increase of $1.7 billion from the previous year. 
Hard- currency reserves amounted to $6.7 billion late last 
year. The gross national debt went up by $3.1 billion in one 
year, to reach $24.6 billion by the end of December. (Budapest

  INVESTMENT BANK PROFITS: The Hungarian Investment and 
Development Bank (MBFB Rt) held total assets last year of 
HUF20.5 billion, registering pre-tax profits of HUF667 million 
and after-tax profits of HUF460 million, according to its March 
2 annual general meeting (AGM) report. These figures are around 
50 percent up on the 1992 figures. MBFB could have paid a 5 
percent dividend from 1992's profit reserves and last year's 
profit, but the AGM decided instead to allocate 50 percent of 
the 1993 profit to general reserves and the other half to profit 
reserves. The bank's total assets are expected to rise to HUF44 
billion this year, with credit outlays of over HUF16 billion, 
eight times more than in 1993. The bank is to become 
increasingly involved in the long-term financing of major 
projects, mainly in the construction and building materials 
industries, and in infrastructure development projects. To 
enable it to do this, MBFB plans to take out long-term credit on 
HUF12 billion from foreign banks. The State Holding Company (AV 
Rt) has raised the bank's reserve capital by HUF2 billion to 
HUF12.2 billion. AV Rt now holds 55.73 percent of the bank, 
with the SPA holding 21.18 percent and the State Development 
Institute (AFI) 22.94 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 1041

  BNP-KH-DRESDNER BALANCE: BNP-KH-Dresdner Bank (BKD) closed 
last year with a balance sheet total of HUF15 billion and a 
pre-tax profit of 454 million forints (HUF). The bank had an 
after-tax profit of HUF377 million, of which HUF200 million was 
set aside for the payment of dividends. BKD had interest 
revenue of HUF1.949 billion, paying out HUF1.417 billion 
interest leaving net interest revenue at HUF532 million. Other 
income was almost HUF600 million. Total operating costs were 
HUF593 million. Of the remaining after- tax profit, the bank is 
to pay HUF109 million into general reserves and HUF67 million 
into capital reserves. The bank's stock of loans amounted to 
HUF4.874 billion in 1992 and HUF5.305 billion last year. BKD's 
stock of state securities grew from HUF494 million in 1992 to 
HUF2.244 billion. BKD was established at the end of 1990 by 
Banque National de Paris (37 percent), Dresdner Bank AG (37 
percent) and Kereskedelmi Bank Rt (26 percent). The bank has 
registered capital of HUF1.14 billion and capital reserves of 
HUF333.3 million. (Budapest MTI in English 1742 GMT 28 Apr 94) 
  GOLDSUN SHARE OFFER: The frozen food company Goldsun 
Hutoipari Rt is to publicly offer 300,000 registered HUF1,000 
face-value shares between May 2 and 13. The new shares will be 
offered to Hungarian private investors and to Hungarian and 
foreign corporate investors. No oversubscription will be 
accepted. The issue price will be HUF1,300 or its equivalent in 
U.S. dollars at the central bank mid-rate on May 2. The issue 
is managed by Talentum Rt. The shares are expected to be 
introduced on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) shortly after 
their issue and are likely to be later floated on foreign stock 
exchanges. Alongside the share issue, Goldsun will also offer 
convertible bonds to a total face value of HUF10 million. The 
convertible bonds will have face value of HUF100 and will be 
issued at par. Each bond entitles the bearer to an option on 
the purchase of one registered ordinary HUF1,000 face-value 
share at a price of HUF1,500 in the first week of November 1995. 
If the option is not used, the bonds may be redeemed at face 
value. The convertible bonds, which will not be introduced on 
the BSE, will be available to Hungarians and foreigners. 
Goldsun Hutoipari Rt, the legal successor of Zalaegerszegi 
Hutoipari Kft, was established as a shareholders' company (Rt) 
on December 1 last year with founding capital of HUF764 million. 
The American investment company, Shamrock Capital Investors III 
Inc bought 51 percent of the Zala company from the State 
Property Agency in April 1992 and purchased the remaining 49 
percent a year later. Sunfrost, Israel's largest refrigerating 
company, bought 50 percent of the company last October. 
Goldsun, which ranks second or third among Hungary's eight 
major frozen food companies, had a sales income last year of 
HUF1.4 billion. Exports to western Europe account for 54 
percent of all sales. Sales are expected to reach HUF1.642 
billion this year and the income from work under commission 
contracts will be HUF103 million. The company is exempt from 
profit tax until 1996 and will enjoy a 60 percent tax allowance 
up to 2001. Last year, Goldsun received a $5.2 million 
development loan from the EBRD, HUF2 million of which was used 
in 1993. (Budapest MTI in English 1355 GMT 29 Apr 94) 
  GRAIN HARVEST FORECASTS: This year's grain harvest is 
expected to be around 6 million metric tons, including a wheat 
harvest of 4 million metric tons. Last year's wheat harvest was 
3.032 million metric tons, which represented an average of 3,060 
kilos per hectare. Wheat was sown on an area of 992,000 
hectares. In 1993, the total harvest of cereals -- grains and 
maize -- was 8.389 million metric tons, with maize accounting 
for 4.012 million metric tons. Last year maize was harvested on 
an area of 1.131 million hectares, an average yield of 3,550 
kilos per hectare. Cereal crops were sown on a total area of 
2.742 million hectares last year. The relatively wet spring 
means that this year's cereal (grains and maize), harvest is 
expected to reach 11 million metric tons. As the domestic 
market generally takes 8.5-9 million metric tons, there is 
expected to be a surplus for export. It is estimated that the 
area sown with maize this year is 1-1.2 million hectares and a 
maize harvest of around 5 million metric tons is forecast.

  GAMBLING: Gambling accounted for one-fourth of payments by 
state firms to the central budget in 1993 (HUF6.7 billion). The 
total revenue of HUF24.4 billion acquired by gambling organizers 
is less than 1 percent of Hungary's annual total domestic 
income. The operation of casinos continues to be the most 
profitable branch within the industry, with a major decline in 
the demand for Bingo and raffle tickets. According to estimates, 
75-80 percent of the population has gambled in one form or 
another at least once. Of them, every third is an active 
punter, placing regular bets. The most popular games, for 
instance, football lottery, the lottery, Bingo, and racing, are 
state monopolies. At present, some 250 firms organize gambling, 
but the state sector continues to dominate gambling. This is 
mainly due to the lottery and football lottery monopoly of the 
Gambling Co., which has an equity of HUF1.8 billion. Of the 17 
casinos operating nationwide, the firm operates nine, and also 
has 12 slot-machine halls, and issued six various raffle tickets 
in 1993. Bingosport Plc. is the other state-owned gambling 
firm, but the number of its Bingo halls fell from 18 to nine in 
1993. No bookmakers operate in Hungary, although a private 
venture opened 14 such offices, based on the English model, but 
was forced to shut down due to heavy losses. The raffle ticket 
and game market also declined: While there were 26 raffle 
ticket issuing companies in 1992, their number was only 19 last 
year. The operation of casinos continues to be the strong part 
of Hungarian gambling; five new casinos were opened in towns 
throughout the country in 1993. This year, another two casinos 
are to open where betting is possible in forints. (Of the 17 
casinos in Hungary at present, only three accept bets in 
forints, the other 14 require foreign currency.) The number of 
slot-machines in Hungary has shown a steady increase since 1992, 
with about 4,000-5,000 throughout the country. Although a law 
bans these, the authorities are unable to enforce the ban as the 
maximum fine that can be imposed is only HUF30,000. Gambling 
brought in revenue of HUF24.4 billion in 1993, which is not even 
one percent of the country's total domestic income. However, 
gambling accounted for more than one-fourth of payments by state 
firms (various taxes and contributions) to the central budget in 
1993. Apart from this, as concession fees, an additional HUF443 
million was levied on gambling organizers. According to surveys 
in 1993, the majority (some 70 percent) of gambling organizers 
ended the year with a loss, or were just able to break even. 
Even the largest state monopoly firm, the Gambling Co. produced 
losses of HUF182 million in the first half of the year, but 
managed to end the year without a loss. Analysts say that 
besides heavy tax burdens, the operational costs of gambling are 
extremely high. Apart from the general taxes levied on 
entrepreneurs, gambling organizers also face additional 
deductions of 44 percent. (Budapest MTI in English 0815 GMT 29

  FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING: Trading on the inter-bank 
foreign-exchange market is calm, with no signs of any forint

  AVU CONTINUES PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU) 
Board confirmed after its meeting on 11 May it would continue 
the privatization process but would concentrate on closing 
transactions already in progress. New tenders are expected to 
be evaluated starting in August. Privatization will not be 
accelerated and the AVU will try to avoid making strategic 
decisions. Its most important aim is to maintain and increase 
the reliability of the process, the board said. (Budapest MTI

  CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT: The current account deficit stood 
at $573 million at the end of February, compared to $378 million 
at the end of January, according to the Hungarian National Bank. 
As a result of a $910 million surplus in the capital account, 
the country's balance of payments showed a $337 million surplus 
in the first two months, as against a $853 million surplus in 
January. The trade balance deficit grew from $389 million in 
January to $536 million in February, with exports amounting to 
$1.146 billion and imports totalling $1.681 billion. In 
February, exports amounted to $540 million and imports totalled 
$687 million, resulting in a deficit of $147 million. Direct 
foreign cash investment amounted to $20 million in February, 
compared to $88 million in January, while long-term capital 
inflow was $1.578 billion, an increase of $102 million from 
$1.476 billion in January. Hungary's international reserves 
stood at $7.333 billion, slightly down on $7.539 billion in the 
preceding month and compared to $6.736 billion at the end of 
last year. Total direct cash investment amounted to $5.661 
billion at the end of January, up from $5.575 billion at the end 
of December 1993. Foreign debt totalled $26.078 billion at the 
end of February, as against $25.698 billion in January and 
$24.560 billion at the end of last year. (Budapest MTI in 
English 1111 GMT 11 May 94) 
  NBH REPORT: The 1993 monetary and budget policies had to be 
corrected, since economic trends were in several respects 
different than expected, says the Hungarian National Bank's 
(NBH) annual report. One difference is that the increase in 
industrial production in 1993 resulted not from exports, but 
mainly from a significant rise in domestic corporate demand. 
Corporate demand was not counterbalanced by a decrease in the 
budget deficit, leading to the rise in domestic demand. The 
foreign trade balance and that of current payments have been 
showing a monthly deficit since the third quarter of 1992. 
Additionally, deposit interest rates have significantly fallen 
as a result of over-liquidity in the banking system, a condition 
intended to allow market interest rates to adjust to the slowing 
rate of inflation. This, however, has discouraged savings. The 
decrease in the deposit interest rate was followed by a smaller 
decrease in the lending interest rate only a few months later. 
As a result, the amount of bank loans has hardly risen, and the 
interest margin has increased over the year. At the same time, 
the central budget financing offered a safe investment 
possibility to banks. High lending interest rates inspired 
prospering companies to take out foreign loans. Corrective 
measures carried out by the central bank over the year aimed to 
boost savings and increase the competitiveness of Hungarian 
products in foreign markets. These measures included the rise 
in central bank interest rates in June and September, the bank's 
urging the Finance Ministry to raise interest on state 
securities, and the devaluation of the forint by a total of 15 
percent in 1993. The impacts of these measures, however, could 
not have been felt in 1993, except for the fact that the savings 
rate stopped falling by the end of the year. Banks' foreign 
debts decreased by a total of HUF6.2 billion in 1993. The 
direct capital inflow and foreign loans taken out by companies 
equaled the current account deficit. There was a slight 
increase in business deposits and a steep one in their debts. 
This resulted in, unlike in 1992, entrepreneurs becoming net 
debtors to the banks with net debts of HUF54.7 billion by the 
end of 1993. Direct foreign loans taken out by companies grew 
by $700 million over last year. Net personal savings showed an 
increase of HUF146.3 billion in 1993, a lower figure than 
expected, and savings were increasingly deposited outside the 
banking sector. Net outstanding claims of banks to the budget 
increased by HUF38.2 billion. Total domestic loans increased by 
HUF16.3 percent, with loans granted to private individuals 
rising by 14.6 percent, and those granted to companies by 18.5 
percent. Net debt of the consolidated state budget significantly 
rose in mid- year; however, it exceeded last year's figure only 
by 3.5 percent at the end of 1993, mainly as a result of the 
privatization of the telecommunications company MATAV in 
December. In 1993 broad money increased by 16.1 percent while 
nominal GDP went up by 18-19 percent. Over the previous three 
years, nominal GDP increased by a lower rate than broad money. 
The velocity of money rose by 2 percent. (Budapest MTI in

  COMPUTER MONITOR ASSEMBLY: Philips plans to establish an 
assembly plant for computer monitors in Szombathely, west 
Hungary. The plant is expected to start operating in September 
and will produce 800,000 monitors a year when it reaches full 
capacity in 1996. The project has the support of the regional 
Labor Office and the local council, with the Labor Office to 
grant a 20 million forint (HUF) loan and the council granting 
the company a tax exemption. The plant is expected to provide 
about 230 new jobs. (Budapest MTI in English 1619 GMT 5 May 94) 
  PHARMACY PRIVATIZATION: The State Property Agency (AVU) is 
to invite tenders for the privatization of 61 pharmacies on 6 
May. The asset value of the pharmacies, including their 
residential real estate, ranges between HUF1.3 million and HUF21 
million. The pharmacies' current stocks will not be included in 
the tenders but successful bidders will be able to buy these 
from regional pharmaceutical centers under a deferred payment 
scheme involving a preferential interest rate. Hungarian 
pharmacies generally have a stock turnover period of one month. 
Other sources put the value of each pharmacy's stocks at 
between HUF1 million and HUF25 million. The pharmacies were 
separated from the regional pharmaceutical centers so that 
bidders could offer payment with E-loans ("existence" loans) or 
compensation coupons. Because of the long-running dispute 
between the AVU and local councils over the ownership of the 
pharmacies, half of the income from the privatization of the 
pharmacies will go to foundations that support pharmacies. The 
AVU is expected to invite bids for the sale of a further group 
of pharmacies in June. (Budapest MTI in English 1639 GMT 5 May

  SLOVAKIA OFFICE: The State Property Agency (AVU) opened its 
second office abroad in Komarno, Slovakia. Hungary's 
compensation laws affect almost 2 million people in 16 
countries. Run by BBS Invest Ltd. of Komarno, the office will 
also have a branch in Moldava nad Bodvou. Both offices will 
provide up-to-date information for any Slovak citizens who are 
eligible for compensation in Hungary. The first AVU office on 
foreign soil opened in Miercurea-Ciuc, Romania, one and a half 
months ago. (Budapest MTI in English 1941 GMT 4 May 94) 
  WINE QUALITY BILL: The Ministry of Agriculture prepared its 
bill on grape and wine production bearing in mind the need to 
put the laws in line with European Union rules. The law will 
guarantee the designation of the place of origin (that is 
quality consistency), and will introduce an origin protection 
system as a guarantee for the financial interest of producers. 
The law would also oblige private wine producers to become 
members of so-called self-administrating "wine-growing 
communities" that will be licensed as authorities. Following the 
change in political system, lands, vineyards and forests were 
reprivatized, and the interests of producers made it necessary 
to meet market demands, mainly to fully observe equality 
guarantees. At the same time, producers themselves also want a 
return to their own, ancient institutions. (Budapest MTI in 
English 0745 GMT 5 May 94) 
  NEW MORTGAGE BILL: A new law under preparation would extend 
mortgages to personal, movable property. The bill is expected 
to go before the new parliament this fall. The mortgage law 
could significantly contribute to the further development of the 
credit system. A team from the London-based European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worked out the mortgage 
model that Justice Ministry officials used to prepare the new 
legal measure. The bill was put together so as to conform to 
Western European legal measures on credit guarantees. Under the 
bill, the mortgage would extend to profits from land (for 
instance, produce). A new element is that mortgaged property 
would not, in all cases, need to be used by the owner until the 
loan is repaid. For instance, rented apartments inhabited by 
tenants, rather than the owner, can be mortgaged. Any item that 
can be possessed can be mortgaged: securities, money, 
transferable rights, claims, and shares in economic 
partnerships. An important change is that mortgage rights can 
also be enforced through execution, not merely through court 
proceedings. There have been cases in the past when the 
property used as a guarantee for the raising of a loan was 
mortgaged only after several years, because of lengthy court 
proceedings. Under the bill, the debtor and the creditor can 
agree on the joint sale of the pledged property. In order to 
prevent the same object being mortgaged more than once, a 
suitable registration system must be created. The bill contains 
several versions for personal, movable properties. Accordingly, 
the territorial chamber of commerce, the trade directory, the 
local council, or notary would be in charge of keeping records.

  GERMAN BUSINESS ADVICE: Small and medium-sized businesses 
will be able to gain start-up help from a German-supported 
advisory system to be established shortly. This follows the 
signing of a cooperation contract between the leaders of the 
National Association of Industrial Bodies (Iposz) and the 
Directorate for the Rationalization of the German Economy (RKW). 
The German Ministry of Economics commissioned the Deutsche 
Ausgleichsbank to grant 1.8 million German marks to finance the 
setting up and operation of the economic coordination office. 
The office will choose advisers by the beginning of June. 
Representatives of new businesses or ones established not longer 
than three years ago may receive six days of advice of which 
half the fees will be paid by the German program. The 
coordination office will be operated until June 1995 by RKW, and 
after that by Iposz. (Budapest MTI in English 1638 GMT 6 May 94) 
  BOOK PUBLISHING PRIVATIZED: The book publishing industry has 
been almost completely privatized. While the country's 
publishers have lost markets, money, and experts due to the 
systemic change, they have acquired new talent, impetus, 
self-organization, and lobbying techniques. State patronage is 
also helping the publication of books today. The number of 
books published nationwide has dropped from 113 million in 1989 
to 80 million by 1994. The number of titles published in a year 
has also declined: from 13,500 between 1991 and 1993, to 12,500 
currently. Privatized book publishing had to start out from a 
capital- deficient situation. Publishers and dealers still lack 
capital. Book wholesalers first gather orders from retailers 
throughout the country, and then forward these to the 
publishers, ordering only the number of books for which they 
have concrete clients. They then add their costs to the price. 
(The price gap between wholesale book trade and retail trade is 
40 percent.) Privatization of book selling has not yet been 
completed. The situation is more favorable in publishing. The 
top 25 publishers are old Hungarian firms, previously taken over 
by the state, and now accounting for 60 percent of the market. 
(Budapest MTI in English 1045 GMT 10 May 94) 
  EXCHANGE RATES: Over the past year, the Hungarian forint 
(HUF) lost 17.9 percent of its value as against the U.S. dollar. 
From May 13, 1990 to May 13, 1994, the forint rate against the 
dollar declined by 58 percent, as a comparative analysis of the 
National Bank of Hungary (MNB) exchange rates shows. Last year 
the forint rate dropped by the greatest extent -- 20.4 percent 
-- against the Swiss franc. (The four-year decline was 54.9 
percent.) Four years ago the MNB sold a Swiss franc for 47.17 
forints, a year ago for 60.7 forints, and now it sells for 73.1 
forints. As compared to the German mark and the Austrian 
schilling, the forint lost 13.5 percent of its value last year, 
and 55.5 percent in four years. Four years ago, the MNB paid 
HUF66.12 for a dollar, HUF40.21 for a mark, and HUF5.71 for a 
schilling. Twelve months ago a dollar equalled to HUF88.62, a 
mark HUF55.06, and a schilling HUF7.82. (Budapest MTI in 
English 1453 GMT 13 May 94) 
  CONSUMER PRICES: According to April 1994 figures, consumer 
prices rose by 1.2 percent in the last month. The increase over 
the past 12 months has been 17.3 percent, the Central 
Statistical Office said. The January 1994 increase in consumer 
prices was 3.2 percent, declining to 1.4 percent in February, 
and to 1 percent in March. The 1.2 percent rise in April was 
primarily due to market conditions and to locally increased 
charges for piped water, sewage, and district heating. Last 
January's inflation rate was 6.8 percent, dropping to 1.7 in 
February, and down to 0.8 percent both in March and April. In 
the past 12 months, the highest rate of inflation occurred this 
April. The average annual increase in the consumer-price index 
-- assessing the figures for the preceding twelve months -- was 
17 percent this January, 16.6 percent in February, 16.8 percent 
in March, and 17.3 percent in April. For an average Hungarian 
family living in an urban area and consisting of two adults and 
two under- 15 children, the minimum subsistence-level monthly 
income rose to HUF51,100 (approx. $510) this April, which is 
HUF12,780 per person. The minimum subsistence-level monthly 
income for a family has risen by a total of HUF500 since 
February, which is an increase of HUF130 per capita. (Budapest

  BONDS IN AUSTRIA: The Hungarian National Bank (MNB) launched 
a 1 billion Austrian schillings bond issue in Austria on 18 May. 
The bond issue was lead-managed by Creditanstalt-Bankverein and 
underwritten by 12 banks. The seven-year bond bears a 9 percent 
interest. This was the second foreign bond issue of the central 
bank this year. The MNB issued bonds to a face value of 2.5 
billion Luxembourg francs (125 million German marks) in 
Luxembourg in March. The MNB plans to raise $2 billion through 
bond issues on the international capital market this year of 
which $1.4 billion has already been realized. The MNB raised a 
total of $4.5 billion through foreign bond issues last year. 
There were two issues of bonds to a total value of $1.1 billion 
at the end of last year, with payment in January 1994. Hungarian 
securities sell well on the Austrian money market. Preparations 
for issuing MNB bonds in yen and German mark are under way.

  SMALL INVESTOR PROGRAM: Hungarian citizens can purchase over 
HUF100 billion (about $1 billion) worth of bonds until the end 
of 1998. Within the framework of the Small Investor Shareholder 
Program (SISP), launched this April, stakes in 70 state-owned 
companies are to be offered to the public over a nearly 
five-year period. The SISP only includes companies fit to be 
introduced onto the stock exchange. This way, 10-20 percent of 
the companies' stake can be sold to private investors. The 
State Property Agency (AVU) has found as many as 70 state-owned 
companies suitable for joining the SISP. Over a five- year 
period, small investors can have access to a total of HUF100- 
200 billion worth of stakes. Customers can pay either in cash 
or by compensation coupons and no coverage is required from 
them. Bonds can also be purchased on loan to be repaid in 
instalments over a five-year period. The SISP began with a 
trial phase in April, offering the bonds of four companies 
involved in trade, hotel and food industry, amounting to a total 
value of HUF4 billion. Following first assessments results, 
public service and pharmaceutical companies will also be 
included in the second phase. More than half of the new owners 
utilized the opportunity for loans, and many paid with 
compensation coupons. Recent polls show that people are 
satisfied with these bonds as investment and utilize the 
possibility of paying in instalments, as these loans are 
interest- free. (Budapest MTI in English 0951 GMT 16 May 94) 
  STATE OWNERSHIP: The government modified its earlier 
decision 
on long-term state ownership. The change affects the state's 
holdings in AB-Aegon Insurance Rt, Penzjegynyomda Rt, Szikra 
Lapnyomda Rt, Postabank Rt, Borsodferr Rt, and Szerencsejatek 
Rt. The State Property Management Corporation (AV Rt) will now 
retain only a single "golden share" in the insurance company 
AB-Aegon Biztosito Rt and in the banknote printing company 
Penzjegynyomda Rt. It was earlier planned that 5 percent of 
AB-Aegon and a 25 percent plus one vote stake in Penzjegynyomda 
Rt would remain in long-term state ownership. Penzjegynyomda had 
shareholders' equity of HUF2.024 billion, with registered 
capital of HUF1.82 billion at the end of last year, of which the 
Hungarian National Bank (MNB) held 50.1 percent, with AV Rt 
holding the remainder. As a result of a HUF600 million equity 
increase earlier this year, the MNB has increased its stake by 
12.1 percent. Forthcoming technical developments at the 
printing company will be financed by the MNB through a further 
equity raise. AV Rt will now retain only a 25 percent plus one 
vote stake in the printing company Szikra Lapnyomda Rt instead 
of the originally planned 50 percent plus one vote. The 
printing company has registered capital of HUF1.8 billion. Some 
of the shares freed will be offered in exchange for compensation 
coupons. The state will now relinquish its entire holding in 
Postabank Rt. It was originally planned that the state would 
hold 20 percent of the bank, but as AV Rt does not plan to 
contribute to a planned HUF2 billion equity raise, the state's 
stake would have fallen anyway to 16 percent. Postabank, which 
has registered capital of HUF6.5 billion, has the most extensive 
branch network in Hungary. The state will now retain only a 25 
percent plus one vote stake in the steel company Borsodferr Rt, 
which was recently established with registered capital of HUF50 
million. It was earlier planned that the company would be 
wholly state-owned. (Budapest MTI in English 1156 GMT 13 May 94) 
  AGRICULTURE FORECAST: A recent Agriculture Ministry report 
expects that 1994 will be a year of stabilization in the 
agricultural sector, with rising production following last 
year's drastic decline. Agricultural production is forecast to 
rise by between 5 percent and 8 percent overall. Although crop 
production is expected to rise by 14-20 percent, no increase in 
livestock production is expected. Food industry output is 
expected to grow by 3-5 percent. Autumn wheat has been sown on 
more than 1 million hectares and this year's total grain crop, 
including maize, is expected to be over 11 million metric tons. 
It is estimated that agricultural production will account for 
16-18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year and 
for at least 25 percent of all exports. One in five people 
works in the agricultural sector. Last year, agricultural 
exports were worth $2.6 billion as compared to $2.2 billion in 
1990, $2.7 billion in 1991, and $2.8 billion in 1992. Up to the 
end of last year, land to a value of 27 million golden crowns 
had been sold through compensation land auctions and the number 
of those acquiring land exceeded 320,000. This year's central 
budget allocates HUF57 billion to agricultural support, with 
HUF10 billion to finance agricultural production and HUF7.5 
billion to finance an ongoing reorganization program. The 
amount available through the Agricultural Development Fund is 
HUF6 billion and HUF2 billion has been allocated to 
infrastructural development. (Budapest MTI in English 1559 GMT 
17 May 94) 
  FAKES CAUSE LOSSES: Although distributors of forged products 
now face a fine of up to HUF20,000, instead of the previous 
HUF5,000, they still cause losses measurable in millions of 
dollars to companies manufacturing and selling quality goods. 
Among the ex-socialist countries Hungary has become the largest 
outlet for forgeries, mostly due to a lack of adequate 
legislation. The Industrial Property Rights Association (IPRA) 
and firms suffering damages from the trend -- mainly sportswear 
manufacturers -- have repeatedly proposed amending the 
misdemeanor law that does not allow confiscation of goods. 
Legal retail trade in Hungary last year amounted to HUF1,500 
billion, with illegal distribution reaching HUF500 billion, 
according to the Consumer Protection Inspectorate. It is 
estimated that black marketeers make profits of HUF200 billion 
from unpaid duties, value added tax (VAT), and personal income 
tax. (Budapest MTI in English 1526 GMT 16 May 94) 
  BUENOS AIRES EXHIBIT: The four-day independent Hungarian 
economic exhibition held in Buenos Aires with support from the 
Ministry of International Economic Relations was termed a 
success by Hungarian officials. The exhibition featured 17 
Hungarian firms, mainly recently privatized small and 
medium-sized companies, which presented their products, along 
with delivery and cooperation possibilities. Argentine business 
groups showed considerable interest in the exhibition. Official 
talks were held on expanding bilateral economic ties. The 
Argentinian business leaders were interested in production 
cooperation, joint ventures, and Hungarian capital investments. 
The latter would mainly be in agriculture and the 
food-processing industry. A demand emerged for participation in 
the privatization of the Hungarian milling industry. In the 
course of official talks, the two sides agreed to speed up talks 
aimed at reaching an agreement on abolishing double taxation. 
Based on Hungarian results in the creation of a market economy, 
the Argentines consider Hungary a possible bridgehead in central 
and Eastern Europe. It was also announced that a chief 
commissioner to coordinate and prepare Argentine participation 
in the 1996 Budapest World Expo would shortly be appointed. 
(Budapest MTI in English 0946 GMT 13 May 94) 
  BUSINESS WITH AUSTRIA: According to International Economic 
Relations Minister Bela Kadar, the change in Hungary's 
government will not affect the development of increased 
Austrian-Hungarian economic links. Hungary hopes the June 12 
Austrian referendum regarding EU entry will turn out positively, 
because Austria's EU membership would clearly have a beneficial 
effect on Hungary. After last year's stagnation, bilateral 
business ties have begun to develop rapidly. Hungary now ranks 
first among Austria's trading partners in the region, and fifth 
worldwide, ahead of the United States and Britain. This trend 
meets the mutual expectations attached to the EFTA agreement. 
In the first quarter of this year, Austrian exports to Hungary 
rose by 15.1 percent, to 4.4 billion schillings, while Hungary 
exported 12.4 percent more goods to Austria, reaching a total of 
2.6 billion schillings. (Budapest MTI in English 1420 GMT 17 
May 94) 
  JAN-MAR ECONOMICS: Central Statistical Office (KSH) figures 
show an increase in the number of economic organizations over 
the first three months of this year, an approximately 1 percent 
rise in prices per month, falling unemployment, and a greater 
foreign trade and central-budget deficit. In the first quarter 
of 1994, 4,699 economic organizations were founded, including 
1,042 with foreign interests. Investments increased by 1.6 
times more than in the first three months of last year, 
calculated at current prices. Industrial production continued 
to increase -- by 9.4 percent -- after last year's upswing. 
Energy use was down 5.7 percent on the first quarter of 1993, 
partly due to the mild winter. Consumer prices rose by 1 
percent from February to March, and by 1.2 percent from March to 
April. The number of unemployed fell by 19,600 in March, to 
611,000 -- 87,000 more than at the same time last year. In the 
period under survey, imports grew by 31 percent and exports by 
25 percent, resulting in a trade deficit of 78.6 billion 
Hungarian forints (HUF), 1.5 times that of last year. The 
current account showed a deficit amounting to $573 million for 
the first two months of this year, 35 percent up on the previous 
year. Gross national debt had risen to $26.1 billion and net 
debt to $16.2 billion by the end of February. The January-March 
deficit of the central budget was double the 1993 first-quarter 
amount, exceeding HUF86 billion. (Budapest MTI in English 1223 
GMT 20 May 94) 
  PRICES RISE: Industrial prices rose 0.8 percent in March and 
were 9.1 percent up on March 1993, the Central Statistical 
Office reported. Domestic producer prices rose 7.8 percent in 
the 12 months up to the end of March. Calculated in forints, 
export prices rose 13.2 percent in the same period. However, the 
rise in export prices was entirely due to the 16 percent 
devaluation of the forint in the period and export producer 
prices fell by around 3 percent calculated in foreign exchange, 
the report adds. Domestic sales prices in the industrial and 
agricultural sectors rose overall by 9.2 percent in the 12 
months up to March. At the end of March, producer prices, 
domestic sales prices and export prices, calculated in forints, 
were all 3.5 percent up on December 1993. Industrial producer 
prices rose by 1.8 percent in January and 0.9 percent in 
February. The 12-month increases were 8.1 percent in January 
and 8.7 percent a month later. Domestic producer prices were 6.8 
percent up in January and 7.5 percent higher in February 
compared to the same months of 1993. On a 12-month basis, 
export prices, calculated in forints, were 12.4 percent up in 
January and 12 percent higher in February. Domestic sales 
prices in the industrial and agricultural sectors were up 8.1 
percent overall in January and 9.0 percent higher in February 
than in the corresponding months of 1993. In March, public 
utility sales prices were on average only 1.7 percent higher 
than a year earlier, with a 15.9 percent rise in the price of 
water, and electricity prices remaining unchanged. Within the 
9.9 percent average increase in producer prices in the 
manufacturing sector, prices of chemicals rose by 5.3 percent 
while those of food, drinks and tobacco rose by 15.2 percent in 
the 12 months up to the end of March. (Budapest MTI in English 
1721 GMT 20 May 94) 
  FARM MARKET EXPECTATIONS: According to the Ministry of 
International Economic Relations, the market for Hungarian 
agricultural produce is expected to improve following the coming 
into force of the GATT agreement in July, 1995. Export prices 
for agricultural produce are expected to increase by 10 percent 
over the medium-term. Export revenue is expected to increase by 
a maximum of $100m a year. This is equivalent to a 5 percent 
rise in agricultural exports based on the current $2 billion 
worth of agricultural produce exported a year. Hungary has 
already met some of the requirements of the GATT agreement, 
including abolishing subsidies. Other requirements could be met 
without major problems. An analysis of the agricultural 
regulations connected with the GATT agreement is expected to be 
completed soon. Agricultural subsidies will be calculated 
according to GATT standards in next year's budget, with 
parliament expected to ratify the GATT agreement this autumn. 
This will follow the building in of bilateral and free trade 
agreements with the EU, European Free Trade Association (EFTA), 
and Central European Free Trade Association (CEFTA) countries. 
(Budapest MTI in English 1427 GMT 24 May 94) 
  ENERGY CONSUMPTION DOWN: Total energy consumption was 383 
peta-joules (PJ) in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent 
less than in the same period of 1993, preliminary figures from 
the State Authority for Energy Management and Energy Safety 
show. The lower figure was the result of higher average 
temperatures and a fall in industrial energy consumption in the 
first four months of this year. Total consumption of electricity 
was 12,343 gigawatt hours (GWh) in the first four months, 3 
percent down on the same period of 1993. In the same period, 
total available energy sources were 386.0 PJ, 0.5 percent down 
on the same period of last year. Of the total, 197.0 PJ came 
from domestic production and 189.0 PJ from imports. The 
proportion of domestic sources was 2.7 percent less than in the 
first four months of 1993. The proportion of coal and other 
coal derivatives fell from 16.2 percent (62.9 PJ) in 
January-April 1993 to 14.8 percent (57.2PJ) in the same period 
of this year, while that of oil and gas grew from 66.9 percent 
(259.6 PJ) to 69.4 percent (266.0 PJ). Energy exports totalled 
21.0 PJ in the first four months of 1994, 5 percent more than in 
the same period of the last year. The country's total energy 
reserves are estimated to have stood at 154 PJ at the end of 
this April, 25.2 percent more than a year earlier. (Budapest MTI 
in English 1559 GMT 19 May 94) 
  HIGH DOMESTIC DEMAND: A high demand market has come about in 
domestic trade over the last few years, mainly as the result of 
import deregulation and expanding enterprise, according to the 
Industry and Trade Ministry. Seventy percent of consumer 
products can now be imported without any restrictions. In other 
areas, such as capital investment goods (fixed assets), the 
proportion is even higher. However, the share of foreign 
capital in domestic trade is lower than the overall average, 
standing at 17 percent. Privatization of domestic trade has 
been successful. Over the last few years, the number of legal 
commercial enterprises has risen from 2,000 to 27,000, and the 
number of private entrepreneurs from 40,000 to 240,000. There 
are still 65 commercial firms operating as state companies. 
However, 14 of them are under liquidation or have gone 
bankrupt. All in all, proprietary and organizational 
transformation has yielded significant results: The value of 
retail trade in 1993 was HUF1967.4 billion, up 2.8 percent over 
the previous year when taking the 121.9 percent retail trade 
price index into consideration. The figure is up 25.3 percent 
when calculated at current prices. At the end of 1993, there 
were 10,700 Hungarian economic organizations in which foreign 
investors held a stake; overall foreign investment amounted to 
somewhat more than HUF116 billion. (Budapest MTI in English 
1148 GMT 24 May 94) 
  FOREIGN ACCOUNT CHANGES: The government amended the 
regulations on the use of forint trade accounts held by 
foreigners. As of June 1, non-Hungarians will be able to 
convert their forint accounts containing income from payments by 
Hungarian importers for foreign goods into foreign currency. 
The change is expected to encourage foreign companies to carry 
out foreign trade deals in forints and represents a further step 
toward the convertibility of the forint. Prior to the current 
amendment, foreigners could use their forint accounts only to 
buy Hungarian goods or services, including goods for export. 
Although non-Hungarians have been able to open forint accounts 
for two years, few have in fact done so and the amounts involved 
were usually negligible. The alteration of this situation was 
the main reason for the government's decision. The Hungarian 
National Bank (MNB) and the government consider encouraging 
foreigners to hold Hungarian bank accounts, either in foreign 
currency or in forints, an important element in the development 
of the economy. The government also intends to stimulate the 
forint money market and in this respect it is of special 
importance that as many foreigners as possible accept forints as 
payment. The current government amendment, however, only 
affects money transfers related to foreign trade deals and 
capital transfers are still subject to foreign exchange 
controls. (Budapest MTI in English 1334 GMT 20 May 94) 
  MINSK-MADE BUS: The first Ikarus bus fitted in Belarus was 
recently introduced into Minsk's public transport. Belarus -- 
due to financial problems and the lack of currency -- had not 
been buying buses from Hungary in the previous four years, 
although it would need at least 3,000 new buses per year to 
renew its present stock. Therefore the Ikarus Rt welcomed 
Minsk's decision on setting up an assembly workshop in order to 
reduce costs and create jobs. The Hungarian Ikarus Rt and the 
Belarusian Amcodor joint-stock concern are planning to assemble 
at least 50 Ikarus buses this year. They also intend to 
increase the proportion of Belarusian parts fitted into the 
buses, expecting it to reach 80 percent in a few years' time. 
At present, 70 percent of Minsk's public transport buses bear 
the Ikarus emblem. (Budapest MTI in English 0756 GMT 24 May 94) 
  EBRD LOANS: The European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) has since 1991 approved 15 major Hungarian 
projects and three smaller ones, mainly for industrial, 
agricultural, and infrastructural development, with a total 
value of $642.2 million. Hungary headed the list for the EBRD 
loans granted in 1993: Hungarian banks and companies received a 
total of 418.3 million European currency units (ECU) (ECU 1 = 
approx. $1.15). The first industrial loan approved by the bank 
in 1991 was an allotment of ECU 5.1 million to assist in 
restructuring one of Hungary's largest printing houses: Petofi 
Press of Kecskemet (Central Hungary). The loan has since been 
repaid. That same year, the Microsystem Co. -- at that time 
considered to be one of the largest private computer technology 
firms in Hungary -- received a loan from the EBRD. Microsystem 
has since gone bankrupt. In 1992 the EBRD provided assistance 
to a total of 30 projects, three of them in Hungary. The most 
important of these was the ECU 65.4 million loan to General 
Motors for construction of an Opel car assembly plant in 
Szentgotthard (western Hungary). The plant is already operating 
and is considered one of the largest Hungarian investments of 
the last four years. (The total value of investments in the 
project was $250 million.) In 1993, the Kner Press Co. of 
Gyomro (central Hungary) received a loan of ECU 9.37 million, 
and Zalaegerszeg Refrigerating Industry Plc. of south-west 
Hungary was granted ECU 4.66 million. The EBRD also approved a 
blanket loan through three Hungarian commercial banks totalling 
ECU 65 million to develop agricultural ventures. The 
revaluation (and the nearly 40 percent increase in equity) of 
Egis Pharmaceuticals in Budapest was considered a sensation in 
the privatization of Hungarian pharmaceutical companies, as the 
EBRD purchased 30 percent of the company's shares at a value of 
ECU 26.52 million. The bank purchased shares in Fusion Invest 
for ECU 3 million, and assisted the construction firm RZB/CEAL 
with a loan of ECU 0.9 million. In addition, it purchased ECU 
6.25 million worth of shares in the Hungarian-French owned 
Accor-Pannonia Hotel. That same year, the EBRD and the Budapest 
Wholesale Market Co. arranged a novel loan agreement, in which 
the bank provided a loan of ECU 5.9 million to develop Hungary's 
agricultural wholesale trade-center in such a way that the 
municipal government agreed to act as guarantor for repayment. 
This year, the first EBRD loan was awarded to a 
Hungarian-French industrial company -- ECU 3 million -- for its 
infrastructure and environmental-protection development 
projects. The EBRD is participating as a shareholder in the 
Vienna-Budapest motorway construction project by providing 
credit, accepting loan guarantees, and acting as the loan 
manager. The EBRD also participated in the Hungarian Foreign 
Trade Bank's international bond-issue. It was the first 
issuance of Hungarian securities abroad in which the state was 
not the repurchasing guarantor. In the future, Hungary hopes 
that the EBRD will help support the growing number of small and 
medium-sized businesses in the country, and assist in the 
development of the money-market, mainly by working through the 
country's banking sector. Hungarian experts believe a concrete 
proving-case for this could be the granting of loans to set up 
Eximbank, which is specifically oriented toward boosting 
exports, based on a government resolution. (Budapest MTI in

  LOT'S NEW ROUTES: This summer, Lot Polish Airlines will 
begin operating five new routes -- to Zagreb, Nice, Salonika, 
Beirut, and Manchester. The route to Zagreb will begin on 16 May 
and will be operated with an ATR-72 aircraft. A second new Lot 
route will begin on 2 June -- a Boeing 737-500 will fly on the 
Warsaw-Lyon-Nice-Lyon-Warsaw route twice a week (Thursdays and 
Sundays). On 26 June, a third route will begin, one to Beirut. 
Until 2 October, Polish aircraft will fly to Lebanon once a 
week. In the period 2 June-29 September, the Warsaw-Salonika 
connection will be in operation, with a Boeing 737-400 and 
weekly flights. And finally, the connection with Manchester 
will be activated on 22 May and will be in operation until 2 
October, with weekly flight on Sundays. Compared with last 
year, the number of charter flights will be increased by half. 
These will be 70 percent serviced by TU-154M aircraft, and by 
Boeing 737's in the other 30 percent. Talks are also under way 
with the airlines of Kazakhstan and China concerning the sale of 
Soviet-made TU-134's and TU-154's. (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in 
Polish 29 Apr 94 p 10). 
  AUTO PRICES: Effective 1 May, prices for all cars 
manufactured at plants in Tychy and Bielsko-Biala, will 
increase. In the case of a Fiat 126p, the price rise will 
increase by around 1.5 million zlotys, and when it comes to the 
Cinquecento and Uno -- by about 5 million zlotys. Here are the 
new prices for a Fiat 126p 650FL: Standard -- 69,906,000 
zlotys, Elegant -- 76,799,000 zlotys, SX -- 78,568,000 zlotys. 
A Cinquecento 704 ccm will cost 119,011,000 zlotys, Cinquecento 
899 ccm -- 141,520,000 zlotys, while a five-door Uno 45 in the 
Standard version will cost 165,000,000 zlotys. The increase in 
prices does not affect those vehicles which are already at the 
dealers, but only those that will be shipped for sale after 1 
May. FIAT Auto Poland justifies the increase by a rise in 
production costs, which in turn is caused by inflation. (Warsaw 
ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 29 Apr 94 p 11) 
  TRADE WITH VIETNAM: A Polish-Vietnamese Economic Forum held 
a session in Warsaw on 28 April. The meeting was organized by 
the National Economic Chamber, the Society of Friends of Four 
Continents, and by the Indochina-Poland Foundation. Trade 
exchange between Poland and Vietnam has been falling since 1991. 
Last year, the amount of exchange was $20 million. Participants 
in the meeting admitted that the needs of both markets must be 
better researched. Polish-Vietnamese trade exchange is 
regulated by a 1991 treaty concerning trade and payments. 
Drafts of two more treaties are in the works -- one on 
prevention of double taxation and another on protecting mutual 
investments. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish 29 Apr 94 p 17) 
  EBRD PACT SIGNED: On 28 April, a framework agreement was 
signed in the Ministry of Ownership Transformations (MPW) 
concerning the Stabilization, Restructuring, and Privatization 
(SRP) program. The agreement was initialed by MPW Deputy 
Minister Ewa Freyberg and by Guy de Selliers, deputy of the 
president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development (EBRD) who is responsible for the banking sector. 
The agreement is not legally binding until it is accepted by 
the Council of Minister and the EBRD Board of Directors. The 
draft was considerably modified. In the first version, only 
limited partnerships were treated as basic ones; right now 
participation in the program can also be extended to limited 
liability companies and joint-stock companies. In the present 
version, it is proposed that companies be transformed on the 
basis of Article 6, Paragraph 1, of the law on the privatization 
of state-run companies, and that stocks or shares be contributed 
to investment partnerships only with the consent of the Council 
of Ministers. Instead of creating a special managerial group, 
SRP Poland would manage the partnerships -- it was agreed that 
this would be decided by the partners of the investment 
partnerships. In the pilot version, it is envisioned that 20 to 
40 companies will be included in the program (initially there 
were supposed to be 180 participants) and two banks (previously 
12). However, if other banks express interest, the program will 
be expanded. The plan of the implementation of the program 
envisions two stages: EBRD and the banks will establish 
investment partnerships, and then the Treasury will contribute 
its shares or stocks to them. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 
29 Apr 94 p 5) 
  SPECIAL ECONOMIC ZONES: The Economic Committee of the 
Council of Ministers (KERM) has approved a draft law on special 
economic zones which includes principles and terms for 
establishment of areas which are supposed to serve to intensify 
economic development and reduce unemployment. In KERM's view, 
the draft law on special economic zones is supposed to be a 
"clear message to all concerned as to what kinds of breaks or 
preferential treatment they can expect," and it includes a list 
of maximum allowable breaks for enterprises active in the zones. 
If a zone is granted all possible beneficial treatments, then 
investors active there will be free from income tax for half of 
the period for which the zone was established, after which they 
will only be paying half of the taxes that would normally be 
due. For a special economic zone to be established, a business 
plan of the entire venture will have to be presented and the 
permission of local authorities will have to be obtained. 
KERM's assessment is that in the initial period, only a few 
places in Poland will have a chance to gain the status of 
special economic zones (Mielec, and the Szczecin-Swinoujscie 
harbor complex, among others). (Warsaw ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 
30 Apr-1 May 94 p 12) 
  MONETARY REPORT: The increased money supply did not have a 
significant impact on the accelerated rate of inflation over 
November and December of 1993 or on the resultant exceeding of 
the overall yearly inflation level -- this according to the 
Polish National Bank (NBP) in its "Report on the Implementation 
of Monetary Policies in 1993." According to NBP, what was 
important for the inflation rise instead, was external factors 
-- that is from beyond the monetary area -- such as changes in 
official prices, an accelerated increase in food prices, and an 
increase in the level of salaries. If money supply growth did 
in fact occur, it was of a secondary nature in relation to the 
above-mentioned phenomena which generated the economy's greater 
demand for money. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 30 Apr-3 May 
94 p 5) 
  PROSPECTS FOR TOURISM: Czeslaw Jermanowski, deputy chairman 
of the Office of Physical Fitness and Tourism, presented a 
program on the principles of developing the tourism industry, 
which is to be debated by the Council of Ministers' Economic 
Committee in mid-May. According to Jermanowski, for the first 
time tourism has a chance of achieving the status of an 
important sector of the economy. According to 1993 data from 
the Tourism Institute, 60 million foreign tourists visited 
Poland last year, spending in the neighborhood of $4.5 billion 
which amounted to as much as 30 percent of all hard-currency 
revenue for the country. "Revenues from tourism could be even 
higher and the industry could bring about more jobs" -- 
Jermanowski says -- "providing that the state finally begins to 
coordinate measures by the different ministries for the sake of 
tourism." This year, the Office of Physical Fitness and Tourism 
plans to spend $6 million on the promotion of Polish tourism 
(including $2 million out of a budget reserve). Next year, 
expenditures should increase to $11 million, in 1996 -- to $13 
million, and in 1997 -- to $15 million. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA 
in Polish 30 Apr-3 May 94 p 20) 
  COMMITTEE CHOOSES CONSORTIA: The Council of Ministers has so 
far approved two lists with 367 enterprises qualified for the 
National Investment Funds (NFI). Another list is being prepared 
which will probably include over 100 enterprises. The Selection 
Committee selected 19 consortia out of the 33 that had been 
submitted. The minister will make the final selection and he 
will sign agreements with the enterprises. He has at his 
disposal 19 consortia for 15 funds. The group of managing 
companies includes Polish-foreign consortia, most often foreign 
investment banks, Polish consulting companies, and Polish 
commercial companies. The members and chairpersons of NFI are 
still being selected. Offers have been submitted by 6,860 
people. Formal criteria were met by 4,840 individuals. The 
average age of the candidates who have passed the stage of 
formal evaluation is 47. After preliminary selection, the group 
includes 2,135 enterprise management specialists, 663 
scientists, and 359 accounting experts. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in

  COMMENTS ON REPRIVATIZATION ACT: Representatives of former 
owners comment on a new, governmental draft reprivatization law 
which is scheduled to be debated by the Council of Ministers' 
Economic Committee today, 6 May. Tadeusz Koss, press spokesman 
for the Polish Union of Real Estate Owners, has told ZYCIE 
WARSZAWY: "This draft law completely legalizes a 
nationalization which was implemented 50 years ago, and it 
legalizes the violation done by the communists on owners of 
houses, factories, and real estate. The current government 
prepared a law which is a disgrace to Polish legislation and to 
the Third Republic of Poland, which calls itself a law-governed 
country. The only hope now is that the president will never 
agree to sign the law. I hereby inform you that the draft law 
is already being translated into French, English, and German. 
Right after that is done, we intend to send it out to all those 
institutions around the world which make sure that people's 
ownership rights are respected. Let us not forget that Poland 
is obliged to respect, for instance, the recently initialed 
European Convention Concerning the Defense of Fundamental 
Freedoms and Human Rights." Andrzej Karnkowski, chairman of the 
Committee for Defense of Private Ownership, says: "This draft 
law envisages an extermination of certain social groups because 
it deprives masses of people, once and for all, of the right to 
regain their property. That is why I say that it is the Polish 
equivalent to the Nuremberg Laws. I also want to point out that 
on 26 April, the government issued orders to the ownership 
transformations minister concerning the goal and extent of 
reprivatization, and three days later, a draft on 
'reimbursements' was ready. Can a document as important as a 
statute be written in such a hurry?! Apart from that, the law in 
this form, completely precludes the possibility for owners to 
execute their rights on the basis of Articles 156-160 of the 
Code of Administrative Procedure, which used to guarantee either 
a regaining of ownership or at least proper reimbursement."

  BUSINESSWOMENS CONGRESS: Almost 150 women who run their own 
companies, perform political functions, and represent women's 
organizations from around the world, are taking part in a 
two-day international conference of female entrepreneurs. The 
organizer of the conference is the International Women's Forum, 
which operates as part of the Main School of Commerce (SGH) in 
Warsaw. The main topic of the conference is female 
participation in business, society, and in family life in the 
countries of East and Central Europe. In the period of 
fundamental transformations going on in this part of the world, 
do women have more chances and opportunities, or do they face 
more dangers? According to Professor Zdzislawa Janowska of Lodz 
University -- who is also a senator -- "the forum is a promotion 
of female entrepreneurs who, in the period of transformations, 
have found themselves on the outside. Being 35 years old, for 
instance, they were fired from their jobs for reasons which were 
not up to them, such as employment cuts or political changes." 
In her speech, Professor Janowska spoke about the need to 
educate unemployed women. So far, she has trained about 700 
women at special training sessions. Of those women, 70 
succeeded in establishing their own companies, including 
advertising agencies, boutiques, coffee shops, art galleries, 
saunas, tailor shops, and even a transportation company. 
Professor Janowska emphasized that more such enterprises could 
emerge if only women had better starting-off points. In the 
view of Professor Eufemia Teichmann of SGH -- who is a 
co-organizer of the meeting -- "women who are owners of 
companies need to have their positions strengthened through the 
creation of lobbying groups. The International Women's Forum is 
definitely such a place." Participants in the conference intend 
to organize an international entrepreneurship center -- under 
SGH auspices -- the main goal of which will be to teach women 
how to establish and run their own companies. (Warsaw NOWA

  NFI MANAGEMENT CANDIDATES: From 33 prospective candidates 
that might manage the National Investment Funds (NFI), the 
Selection Commission chose 19 consortia. It decided that they 
might be recommended to the minister of ownership 
transformations. One of the candidates recommended by the 
Selection Committee is the Raiffeisen Atkins Consortium, which 
comprises Raiffeisen Investment AG (26 percent), WS Atkins 
Limited (25 percent), and three Polish companies: Idea Ltd. 
from Gdansk (9.5 percent), WIL Consulting House Ltd. from Poznan 
(9.5 percent), and ADIN Ltd. from Wroclaw (5 percent). Another 
consortium which has been selected is the Western Fund, whose 
shareholders are the Western Bank (33.67 percent), Central 
Europe Trust Co Ltd. (33 percent), Charterhouse plc. (22.22 
percent), and Credit Comercial de France (11.11 percent). The 
group of potential managing companies also includes a 
consortium, the greatest shareholder of which is the French bank 
Arjil; the greatest Polish shareholders will be the Warsaw 
Consulting Group and the Agency for Industry Development; the 
smallest shareholder -- the Bank of Socioeconomic Initiatives. 
Here are three more consortia: Polish Privatization Society -- 
Kleinwort Benson Ltd.: Kleinwort Benson Overseas B.V. (51 
percent) and Polish Group of Managing Funds (49 percent), which 
is the sole property of the Polish Bank of Development. Krakow 
Investment Firm: Industrial-Commercial Bank (40 percent), 
English company Invesco CEAM (4 percent), and the Boston- based 
Recovery Group. Eagle Management Company: 
Smith-Barney-Shearson Inc. (36 percent), Pro-Invest Intl. (26 
percent), Privatization Group Inc. (26 percent), and the Upper 
Silesian Economic Bank (12 percent). (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in

  APRIL ECONOMY: The economy still shows considerable 
liveliness, even though there are some symptoms suggesting that 
within the next few months, this level of activity may decrease. 
There are no signals suggesting that this would be a long-term 
decline. The indicator of production size increased in April, 
though less than in March; the percent of companies registering 
production increased (from 23 percent in March to 31 percent) 
and the percentage of companies registering a decrease in 
production decreased (from 36 to 24 percent). The indicator of 
the influx of new domestic orders in April remained at the same 
level as in March. However, the influx of export orders 
decreased considerably. Despite that, the indicator of the size 
of export production still increased. There was a slight 
decrease in the last three months in the indicator of the 
advantages from export production in relation to the advantages 
from production for the domestic market. The competitiveness of 
Polish products remained at the same level in April as in 
January. Over the last three months, there was a slight 
decrease in the indicator of the competitiveness of foreign 
commodities on the Polish market. This indicator started to 
drop quite considerably in July of last year; 20 percent of 
Polish manufacturers do not feel any foreign competition at all. 
In April, unemployment was higher than in March. A lot seems 
to suggest that the drop in unemployment in March was not a 
long-term trend. The present unemployment indicator dropped to 
the level of the last six months. Companies predict that this 
rate should be maintained for another three or four months. The 
rate of wage increases suggests most companies did not raise 
wages too much. In the April study, a considerable improvement 
in the financial situation was noted. The improvement trend was 
detected throughout 1993, however, this phenomenon appeared most 
noticeably in April 1994. This trend is expected to be 
maintained over the next few months. The same goes for the 
so-called optimism indicator. The report was prepared by Maria 
Drozdowicz from the Economic Development Institute of the Main 
School of Commerce. (Warsaw RZECZPOSPOLITA in Polish 10 May 94 
p 7) 
  CENTRAL BANK'S ROLE: "The policies of the central bank 
(National Bank of Poland -- NBP) vis-a-vis endangered banks, and 
NBP involvement in commercial banking activities, raise a lot of 
controversy" -- says Wojciech Kostrzewa, chairman of Polski Bank 
Rozwoju SA, in a report which presents mutual relations between 
NBP and commercial banks in the first half of the 1990's. 
According to Kostrzewski, the problem concerns primarily 
situations where banks faced with bankruptcy try to use all 
available means to maintain their current financial liquidity. 
On the one hand, the bank's managers offer attractive terms of 
money deposits to potential clients without hesitation, while on 
the other hand, clients deposit their money in such a bank 
because they regard it as having guarantees from at least the 
NBP, if not the State Treasury. Another aspect is associated 
with special relations that arise between NBP and those banks in 
which NBP has capital participation. Regardless of the actual 
situation and public statements, doubts will continue to arise 
as to whether -- in situations of a conflict between NBP's 
interests as an owner, and its interests as the currency-issuing 
bank -- the latter interest will really prevail. The only 
effective method for a permanent resolution of the situation 
would be for NBP to sell its shares in commercial banks as soon 
as possible, to other banks or to interested investors. (Warsaw 
NOWA EUROPA in Polish 9 May 94 p 21) 
  WAGE CONTROL BILL: Finance Minister G. Kolodko said on 11 
May that he did not expect President Walesa to block new wage 
curbs when they are completed by the parliament later this 
month. Kolodko told a news conference the government plans to 
scrap the controls effective 1995 but first it needs to 
transform most state-owned enterprises into Treasury-owned joint 
stock companies. "I anticipate that the president will sign the 
wage control bill which the government has agreed to keep in 
force only by the end of the year" --Kolodko said. He also said 
changing the legal status of state-owned enterprises is 
necessary to replace wage controls in the public sector with a 
mechanism of collective bargaining between employers and unions. 
Walesa vetoed an earlier version of the wage control law saying 
it was anti-market but the government amended it along Walesa's 
suggestions and it was resubmitted to parliament. (Warsaw NOWA 
EUROPA in English 12 May 94 p 24) 
  BANK RESTRUCTURING OBSTACLES: "Common sense will prevent 
ideas coming from Sejm deputies, on restructuring cooperative 
banks [banki spoldzielcze], from materializing in practice, as 
the ideas do not solve anything. All they will do is lead to a 
further dispersion in the banking system. Implementing the ideas 
does not guarantee that better service will be provided to 
customers -- on the contrary, it will lead to a further 
breakingdown of the structure of cooperative banks and of the 
Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej [BGZ], and a decreased quality of 
service provided to agriculture and the entire economy," said 
Kazimierz Olesiak, chairman of BGZ's board of directors, during 
a conference of directors of BGZ's voivodship departments which 
took place on 20 May. Olesiak stressed that the government 
program for restructuring cooperative banks resolves the 
security problem of the entire sector. The proposed reforms are 
not intended to make cooperative banks state-owned but on the 
contrary, they are designed to render cooperative banks even 
more "cooperative." "Regional banks currently in operation, are 
not capable of providing a good future for cooperative banks. 
In my view, the regional banks fear for their own structures 
and posts," Olesiak said. The government draft law on 
restructuring cooperative banks and BGZ, envisages subsidies to 
cooperative banks through the State Treasury's restructuring 
bonds, additional financing coming from the National Bank of 
Poland, a conditional waiver of having to transfer mandatory 
reserves, tax breaks, a concentration of the financial means of 
cooperative banks (securing them against bankruptcy), and other 
types of measures. The draft law also speaks of a reduction of 
the debt burden of enterprises servicing agriculture and the 
food industry through a transfer of State Treasury bonds to BGZ 
for the purpose of reducing the debt burden of enterprises such 
as fruit and vegetable processing plants, state-owned grain 
plants, sugar mills, the State Treasury's agricultural units, 
and other units of food and agricultural processing. A draft 
coming from Sejm deputies for the Freedom Union (UW), is based 
on the principle of complete independence and self-governing by 
cooperative banks. In the view of Sejm deputies for UW, the 
government draft is not clear enough on the subsequent fate of 
voluntarily established regional structures of cooperative banks 
(apart from BGZ) operating in Wroclaw, Warsaw, and Poznan. This 
year, BGZ will initiate about 4 trillion zlotys' worth of 
credits for purchasing agricultural products. Out of a 
2.5-trillion zloty reserve in the state budget for the purpose 
of subsidizing agricultural credits, BGZ has received about 1.2 
trillion zlotys. The remaining amount will be distributed by 
the Finance Ministry among 30 other banks. There is 16 trillion 
zlotys reserved in the budget for restructuring BGZ and 
cooperative banks. Among other things, the financial means are 
devoted to enterprises servicing agriculture. (Warsaw NOWA 
EUROPA in Polish 23 May 94 p 18) 
  ILLEGAL INSURANCE OPERATIONS: Western insurance companies 
have been "stealing away" customers in great numbers, from 
Polish units. The Finance Ministry warns that their insurance 
policies, despite being cheaper, are illegal in Poland. 
According to the legal system in effect in Poland, one is not 
allowed to enter into an insurance contract with a company that 
does not have the finance minister's license to operate in 
Poland, the ministry's press office reminded on 20 May. "The 
problem applies mainly to Austrian and Swiss life insurance 
policies which are being illegally distributed by brokers," 
Miroslaw Kowalski of the Commercial Union company explains. "We 
have filed two motions for prosecution with the public 
prosecutors office, concerning a violation of the law by two 
Western insurance companies," Jozef Jakubowski of the Polish 
Insurance Chamber adds. Unofficial figures are that 10,000 life 
insurance policies have been sold to Polish people by firms from 
Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Great Britain. The biggest 
number -- about 4,500 policies -- was sold by the Vienna-based 
Interunfal company. The Finance Ministry would like to 
emphasize that persons who purchase policies from insurance 
companies operating without a license, must take into account 
that in case of refusal to pay damages stipulated in the 
agreement, they will not be able to enforce their rights in a 
Polish court of law. The fact that a foreign company offers 
better terms than a domestic one, has no impact on the legality 
of the insurance policy issued by that foreign company. (Warsaw 
ZYCIE WARSZAWY in Polish 21-22 May 94 p 11) 
  POSITIVE APRIL FIGURES: According to the Central Office of 
Statistics (GUS), April was another good month for the economy, 
but what causes concern is the rise in prices which was the 
biggest since the beginning of the year. "We are just 
witnessing the second anniversary when for the first time, we 
were able to report an increase in output," said Halina 
Dmochowska of the GUS Analysis and Reports Department while 
opening a conference on 23 May devoted to April economic 
results. In April, output was 8.6 percent higher than a year 
ago but it was also 8.2 percent lower than in March. This kind 
of a decrease occurs every year, while in this case, there were 
additionally two fewer work days than usually. Among other 
seasonal phenomena, there is a decreased acceleration of 
salaries and a decreased volume of retail sales (this always 
happens after Easter). For four months now, salaries have been 
higher -- after adjusting for inflation -- compared with a year 
ago. The situation of enterprises has improved, as well as the 
state of investment, and their balances of payment (the negative 
balance is not as high). Unemployment decreased by 0.3 percent 
but this is most probably a short-lived effect since fresh 
graduates will be seeking jobs soon. What is particularly 
disturbing, is the rise in prices (by 2.9 percent) which is the 
fastest so far this year. Prices for services jumped the most 
(apart from hot water and central heating), followed by train 
and bus tickets, and fees for staying at convalescent homes 
(which tripled). Prices for food increased by quite a lot, 
relatively speaking (by 2.8 percent); this comprises potatoes 
and vegetables (by over 8 percent), dairy products (by 4 
percent), various kinds of cheeses (by as much as 9 percent), 
and eggs (by 4.6 percent). In the first quarter of 1994, the 
value of exports was $3.3 billion, while the value of imports 
was $4 billion. The negative trade balance amounted to $648 
million which is not as high as last year. (Warsaw GAZETA 
WYBORCZA in Polish 24 May 94 p 17) 
  CUP REPORT: Although industrial production was lower in 
March, it exceeded last year's level by 8.9 percent. Over the 
four months, its volume increased by one-tenth compared with the 
beginning of 1993 -- reports the Central Planning Administration 
(CUP). The financial situation of companies is favorable (the 
net positive financial result was 9 trillion zlotys), even 
though the financial reserves of "economic entities" were 
slightly lower in late April than in December last year. 
Results in the foreign trade area are better as well; for the 
first time in five years, there was an increase in the amount of 
money spent on investment in enterprises with more than 50 
employees. Despite the fact that the month was two days shorter 
and production dropped in comparison with March, wages in April 
(without the companies' profit pays) increased by another 1.9 
percent. Prices went up as well. The inflation rate in April 
was 2.9 percent and it was the highest so far this year. When 
asked to comment on these results, Tadeusz Chroscicki, director 
of the CUP Department of Information and Forecasts, said that he 
is not worried by the drop in production dynamics in April. He 
is more concerned about the lowering of discipline in wage 
policies -- and primarily, by the increase in inflation. The 
price increase in April did not exceed 3 percent, but, if this 
trend is not halted, it is increasingly more likely that it will 
reach 31 percent throughout the year, even though it was 
estimated that the year's inflation would not exceed 27 percent. 
Right now, it is fueled, among other things, by the lack of an 
enterprise tax on above-normative pays (in addition, there are 
no other mechanisms that would regulate wages). Trade unions 
are demanding higher wages; such an increase in wages must 
affect the production costs and consequently, cause prices to 
rise. The increasing costs of maintenance hits persons with low 
wages, disabled pensioners, and senior citizens the hardest. 
The June valorization of pensions may be very quickly nullified 
by an increase in prices. (Warsaw TRYBUNA in Polish 23 May 94 p 
4) 
  INSURANCE BUREAU PRIVATIZATION: The position OF current 
management of PZU SA (State Insurance Bureau) is that it is 
necessary to maintain the integrity of PZU SA as a national and 
financially strong Polish insurer. The company is able to 
supplement capital deficiencies that it suffers from, with its 
own means and ways and without resorting to foreign loans. For 
some time now, there was a difference of views between the 
company and its owner -- that is the Finance Ministry -- 
concerning the way that the company should be privatized and 
restructured. In its previous personnel composition, the 
ministry's leadership was in favor of an idea under which the 
first step would be to replace the missing capital of the 
company with means that would be loaned to the state budget by 
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with the 
second stage being the symmetrical division of PZU SA into two 
companies, and the third and final stage comprising 
privatization of one of the companies followed by the other one. 
But PZU SA's management persistently opposes the Finance 
Ministry's concept. Management has submitted its own draft of 
the company's privatization, under which three stages would take 
place: The first stage would be another assessment of the value 
of PZU SA's assets and the introduction -- by the middle of next 
year -- of a new issue of the company's shares. In the second 
stage -- which should last until the end of 1995 -- shares from 
another issue would be distributed among the employees. The 
State Treasury would retain a majority of the shares after the 
two stages. The essence of the third stage would be domestic 
and foreign investors purchasing those PZU SA's shares which 
will have been retained by the State Treasury. (Warsaw NOWA 
EUROPA in Polish 24 May 94 p 1) 
  EXPORT CREDITS GUARANTEES: Companies that made a decision to 
conduct risky trade with the East, will be able to avail 
themselves of insurance against political risk, natural 
disasters, and the danger of a partner's delaying his payment 
for merchandise exported. Exports will be facilitated through 
long-term credits guaranteed by the State Treasury. On 24 May, 
the government decided to approve a draft law concerning 
insurance of export contracts. If it is subsequently adopted by 
the Sejm, it will be possible to conduct trade with partners 
from countries of the former USSR -- and with some others, too 
-- under more convenient circumstances. Insurance will be 
provided by the Corporation for Export Credit Insurance (KUKE 
SA) which up to now, has only been providing short-term credits, 
and those applied only to trade risk. KUKE SA will be insuring 
contracts on its own behalf but the Budget Law will specify a 
maximum limit which will have to be observed in insurance 
contracts. The limit for this year, will most probably not 
exceed 25 trillion zlotys. According to the draft law approved 
by the government, the state would also guarantee payment of 
damages. If partners turn out insolvent, KUKE will repay 85 
percent of the value of the contract, to the exporter. The 
insurance will be valid both before and after merchandise is 
sent or services are rendered. "We have submitted the draft law 
to be dealt with through so-called accelerated legislative 
proceedings. We hope it will become law before the end of June. 
If not, then it will return to parliament in September," said 
Deputy Finance Minister Ryszard Michalski. The draft law 
provides that long-term credits (from a few billion to more than 
10 billion zlotys) will be guaranteed by the State Treasury. 
Money for that purpose is to come from a special reserve in the 
state budget. The State Treasury will also provide guarantees 
for insurance from non-commercial risk. The Finance Ministry is 
to oversee KUKE SA's activities. In line with government 
strategies for supporting exports, only payments for exports of 
Polish merchandise will be insured. (Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in 
Polish 25 May 94 p 17) 
  KERM DISCUSSES BANKS: At its session on 25 May, the Economic 
Committee of the Council of Ministers (KERM) discussed the 
condition of the banking sector in Poland. As Witold Kozinski, 
first deputy president of the National Bank of Poland (NBP) 
pointed out, the situation in this sector is not very good. It 
was also said that the criteria in line with which NBP provides 
money to improve this situation, are unclear. Cooperative banks 
are in the worst situation; three consolidation projects have 
been prepared. State-owned banks, which are in a better 
situation than the rest, have a powerful owner and they will 
receive additional capital sooner or later. KERM also accepted 
the draft of an ordinance of the Council of Ministers concerning 
the specification of a list of enterprises and Treasury-owned 
joint- stock companies which will be included in the program of 
National Investment Funds (NFI). Last August, the Council of 
Ministers accepted a list of 195 Treasury-owned joint stock 
companies, and in September -- 165 state-owned companies and 
seven Treasury-owned joint-stock companies. Ownership 
Transformations Deputy Minister Ewa Fryberg said that 12 
enterprises were crossed off either due to their bad economic 
situation or because there appeared a possibility of privatizing 
them more quickly on the capital path (there appeared a concrete 
investor). KERM also accepted a third list -- a list of 88 
state-owned companies which will be transformed into Treasury- 
owned joint-stock companies, and 17 companies whose shares will 
be introduced in the NFI. In all, 460 companies, transformed 
into Treasury-owned joint-stock companies, will participate in 
the program. The book value of the companies included in the 
program was initially estimated at 100 trillion zlotys. The 
concrete value is not yet known. The financial results of these 
companies will be known in approximately two months. Between 15 
and 17 funds will be set up which will manage their property. 
The plan is that they will contribute their shares as the 
funds' property in October or November, but it is not certain 
whether it will be possible to adhere to this schedule: The 
supervisory boards of the funds have not been selected yet and 
the Selection Committee is still testing candidates. (Warsaw

  TRADE VOLUME IMPROVES: The National Board of Statistics has 
announced a slight improvement of Romania's foreign trade 
activities over March 1994, although the volume of trade 
exchanges is still low and the balance of trade over the first 
term of the year is still registering a deficit as a consequence 
of the crude oil imports. The March exports with payment in hard 
currency totalled approximately $495.2 million, which is 63 
percent more than in February 1994 and 34.2 percent more than in 
March 1993. The March imports with payment in hard currency 
totalled approximately $439.4 million, that is, 24.2 percent 
less than in March 1993. Over the first three months of 1994 
exports totalled $1,080 million, of which 51.9 percent went to 
developed countries, 29.7 percent to developing countries, and 
18.4 percent to transition countries. Romania's major export 
partners were Germany, Italy, Turkey, and France. (Bucharest 
ROMPRES in English 0913 GMT 29 Apr 94) 
  TRUCK PLANT PROSPECTS: "For 1994 we set ourselves the goal 
of achieving a turnover of 215 billion lei and a profit of 9.3 
billion lei at current prices," Romulus Moucha, general manager 
of the Roman Ltd truck plant told CURIERUL NATIONAL. Concerning 
exports, Moucha mentioned good ties with a Ukrainian company to 
which Roman-made tractors are being exported, the only tractors 
that manage to cross Siberia at extremely low temperatures. "We 
intend to set up a joint venture with a French company 
authorized by Renault. We already have a contract signed with 
that company for the import of motors and product integration. 
There is also a significant demand for our coaches equipped 
with Renault engines or with other engines, which have proved to 
be competitive on European highways," Moucha added. Among the 
Romanian truck factory's partners Moucha also mentioned Cuba, to 
which 22,000 trucks and diesel engines have been exported over 
the past years. "Cuba wants to re-equip 12,000 of its ZIL-type 
trucks, replacing their gasoline engines with diesel-oil-fuelled 
engines that are delivered by the Roman Ltd company. The 
factory also supplies cast iron parts worth $2 million annually 
to a German company and several other components to the United 
States and France," the manager of the Roman Ltd concluded.

  BANK WITH TURKEY: The Turkish-Romanian Bank with a planned 
capital of 8 billion lei proposes to become operational in the 
second half of May this year. The bank's vice president, Victor 
Juganaru, informs that on 27 April the newly employed personnel 
of the bank completed a 45-day training course given by the 
British firm D.C. Gardner. "The future of the bank is in the 
hands of these graduates," Erdogan Gunay, general director of 
the Turkish-Romanian Bank said at the close of the course 
attended by 20 young Romanian bank clerks. Currently the 
registered capital of the bank amounts to 4 billion lei, but 
that is to be augmented to up to 8 billion lei. A proportion of 
80 percent of the capital comes from the Turkish Bayndir holding 
and its affiliates operating in the fields of construction, 
tourism, health, finance, insurance, and trade, while the 
balance of 20 percent comes from the Romanian Commercial Bank.

  UKRAINE PROTOCOL: A protocol between the Romanian and the 
Ukrainian Governments on continuing cooperation in the building 
the Krivoy-Rog mining combine will be signed during the visit 
paid in Ukraine by a Romanian delegation on 4-6 May, authorized 
sources in the Romanian Ministry of Trade say. Originally, the 
cooperation began after a convention between Romania and the 
former USSR was signed in December 1986. After having declared 
its independence, the Government of Ukraine took over the 
obligation to build that unit and re-negotiated the terms of 
cooperation with the other parties participating in the project,

  COOPERATION WITH EGYPT: "The cooperation agreement concluded 
at the end of April in Cairo between the Romanian Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (CRCI), on one side, and the Egyptian 
Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Industries 
and the Egyptian Businessmen's Association, on the other, 
stipulates business information exchanges on a permanent basis, 
the organization of economic missions, and the two countries' 
participation in various international fairs and exhibitions," 
Liliana Deac, director of the CRCI stated. On the same occasion 
they agreed upon the setting up of working groups in both 
countries, which will start operating this year as bilateral 
chambers of commerce, said the same source. The Romanian 
delegation, consisting of representatives of the CRCI, several 
companies, and the Egyptian-Romanian Bank had on the same 
occasion an interview with Egyptian businessmen. The Romanian 
side presented its offer of machines, equipment, metal products, 
tractors, farm machinery, ball bearings, electric motors, 
chemicals, cars, iron and steel products, wood, paper, and food. 
Regards the imports from Egypt, currently they mainly consist 
of crude oil, yarn cotton, furnace coal, power cables, 
refrigerators, cotton fabrics, ready-made clothing, cosmetics, 
medicines, and food. The 1993 total volume of the commercial 
exchanges carried out by the two countries was assessed at 
$165.7 million, the Romanian exports to Egypt totalling $101 
million, while imports from Egypt topped $64.7 million. This 
autumn, an Egyptian economic mission is to begin its activity 
under the aegis of the CRCI and the Egyptian Businessmen's 
Association. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0944 GMT 4 May 94) 
  MOBILE TELEPHONE SPREADS: Romania Telefonica, the 
Romanian-Spanish joint telecommunication venture, which set up 
the first cellular mobile telephony network in Romania a year 
ago, plans to expand to the provinces. The system is currently 
in operation only in the capital and has some 1,000 subscribers. 
By the end of next June, it will be extended to Brasov and 
Constanta, and there are plans to introduce mobile telephony in 
all the towns of Romania with more than 100,000 inhabitants.

  SWISS BANKERS VISIT: President Ion Iliescu received a 
delegation of the Union des Banques Suisses-UBS headed by Robert 
Favarger, vice-president of the management board, and Friedrich 
von Schwarzenberg, UBS executive vice president. The interview 
was attended by Mugur Isarescu, governor of the National Bank of 
Romania, and by Traian Chebeleu and Misu Negritoiu, presidential 
advisers. After the interview, Robert Favarger told journalists 
he came to Romania to get acquainted with the state of the 
economy here and that he had meetings with many prominent 
figures. He said the meetings preceded the signing of a loan 
agreement between the UBS and the National Bank of Romania on 6 
May. The contract, he said, was a clear proof of the fact that 
international banking institutions have a vested interest in the 
development of the Romanian economy. National Bank Governor 
Mugur Isarescu said the agreement "means the breaking of the 
last financial isolation in the sphere of private capital 
investments." (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1335 GMT 5 May 94) 
  SWISS BANK LOAN: The Union Bank of Switzerland-UBS, one of 
the biggest private Swiss banks, granted a $60 million loan to

  BALL BEARING PRODUCTION: After a slump in the first years 
that followed the fall of the communist regime, ball bearing 
production is registering a comeback. The largest and oldest 
Romanian manufacturer, RULMENTUL of Brasov produced 23.6 million 
bearings in 1993 -- a 25 percent production increase compared 
with the previous year. The factory also managed to increase 
its exports by 26 percent. This year the factory plans to 
manufacture 27 million ball bearings. Other contracts currently 
under negotiation with partners from all continents may boost 
production even further and increase the share of exports to 80 
percent. The fact that Romania was granted most favored nation 
status has brought the U.S. market back among the top importers 
of Romanian ball bearings, and it may even place first this year 
among the factory's customers, with orders for some 15 million 
pieces. Other partners for RULMENTUL's exports are England, 
Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Thailand, Taiwan, Singapore, 
Argentine, Brazil, and Venezuela. This will regain the Brasov 
factory the position of seventh/eighth producer of ball bearings 
in the world and the third to fourth place in Europe. In this 
context, it is worth recalling that the factory has recently 
obtained an important credit for technological updating from the 
Japanese company Koyo, guaranteed by the Japanese Government.

  TIES WITH CHINA: A delegation of the National Committee for 
Trade Promotion of the Chinese Chamber of International Commerce 
met with officials of the Romanian Trade Ministry in order to 
spur the development of the commercial relations between Romania 
and the People's Republic of China. China is Romania's main 
market in Asia and second market worldwide. The main subject of 
the talks was the intensification of the bilateral cooperation 
and the new opportunities for trade exchanges. Ion Pasol, 
assistant-director of the Asia-Oceania Department of the 
Romanian Ministry of Trade, said that the development of the 
traditional Romanian-Chinese relations were mainly focussed on 
Timis County, Western Romania, as well as on the sectors of the 
light and medicine industries. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English

FRG Interior Ministry to Romania to implement the national 
program of labor retraining and social insurance was signed in 
Bonn on 7 May by Romanian State Minister Dan Mircea Popescu, 
minister of labor and social protection, and Manfred Kanther, 
FRG interior minister. The program is financed by the World 
Bank and starts with the experience gained by Romania and 
Germany following the operation of the professional retraining 
centers at Vladimiresti-Arad, Timisoara, and Sibiu, which are 
financed by the Germans. The Germans will contribute 1.5 
million marks in the next four years to the program that will 
materialize in 50 centers all over Romania. (Bucharest ROMPRES

  TRADE FIGURES: "For the first time after December 1989, 
Romania's trade in the first quarter of 1994 has registered a 
relatively balanced evolution and the biggest volume of exports, 
about $1.1 billion," Mihai Berinde, head of the Foreign Trade 
Department of the Ministry of Trade, said in a recent interview. 
The best results were scored in March, when exports amounted to 
$500 million, that is a 34.2 percent increase over the similar 
period of last year. Mihai Berinde considers that "conditions 
exist for Romania to increase its exports to the European Union 
and EFTA markets by at least 10 percent. The American market, 
following the redemption of the most favored nation status, will 
absorb some 20 percent more goods as compared to the Romanian 
exports there last year." The Romanian official said that "the 
Eastern market is also being regained," with the Russian 
Federation and Ukraine having returned to the first five places 
in Romania's foreign trade list. Free zones of mutual interest 
are expected to be created with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, 
and Bulgaria. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0732 GMT 10 May 94) 
  DEVELOPMENT AGENCY REPORT: The annual report issued by the 
Romanian Agency for Development (ARD) states that participation 
of foreign capital in Romanian companies amounted to 
$144,419,780. The report proposes a number of concessions to be 
granted to the large foreign investors. ARD President Nicolae 
Jantea said the agency had undergone a structural change in 
1993. The ARD has registered 8,683 companies with foreign 
capital worth over $144 million in 1993. The agency supplied 
information and assistance services to prospective investors in 
the fields of banking, commercial, insurance, 
telecommunications, services, trade, and so forth. The ARD 
proposed some amendments to the law on foreign investments. If 
they are approved, the foreign companies with a nominal capital 
smaller than $1,000 will not receive certificates of investors. 
On the other hand, the companies investing more than $10,000 
would benefit from a set of facilities such as exemption from 
tariffs on raw and auxiliary materials, and lower income taxes. 
The facilities would be considerably larger for long-term (14 
years) productive investments over $50 million, which integrate 
more than 60 percent of their production volume into the 
Romanian economy and export over 50 percent of their production.

  TRADE WITH BRAZIL: The volume of trade between Romania and 
Brazil stood at $54.4 million in 1993. Romanian imports, mainly 
iron ore and manganese, totalled $51 million dollars, which 
shows a trade deficit for Romania. As a consequence, a major 
objective for 1994 is to increase Romanian exports of tractors, 
farm machinery, and automobiles. Romania has already penetrated 
the Brazilian market with products such as passenger and freight 
cars, power transformers, and building materials. (Bucharest

  PRIVATIZATION OF TOURISM: "Without being a supporter of 
statistics myself, I feel that privatisation has already started 
and has even reached such a pace capable of leading to the end 
of the process scheduled for the beginning of 1996, when most of 
the touristic companies are to become private," Romanian 
Minister of Tourism Matei Dan told the business journal 
PERIODICAL. "Economic analysts can assess that Romania has 
witnessed a stable economic flow in the past two years, 
recording about 6 million foreign tourists arriving in, and 10 
million Romanian citizens getting out," the Romanian minister 
said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0734 GMT 12 May 94) 
  COMPANIES WITH FOREIGN CAPITAL: There were 112 companies 
with 
foreign capital of over $1 million in Romania at the end of 
April. They cover a wide range of domains: extraction, 
electronics, electrical engineering, chemistry, farming, trade, 
banking, transport, and insurance. Joint ventures with a volume 
of foreign capital of over $10 million number 18, including: 
Shell-Rompetrol with $44 million, Alber, a venture between the 
Leonida Teohari of Canada and Astra Zalau, Avicola with $24 
million, Celmag Spa (Italy), Socomet Otelul Rosu with $22

$17.1 million, Enterprise Oil (Britain)-Rompetrol SA with $17 
million, and Phoceenne de Metalurgie (France)-IUCFOR Ramnicu 
Valcea with $14.5 million. The recently inaugurated World Trade 
Center Bucharest (a joint venture with the participation of the 
Bouygues SA concern and of the Romanian Bank for Foreign Trade) 
is 14th in the standings of the biggest companies with foreign 
participation, having a capital of almost $13 million and 10 
billion lei. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0839 GMT 12 May 94) 
  CAPITAL INVESTMENT: Sources in the Romanian Ministry of 
Industries say the investment effort in industry went up 35 
percent in 1994, reaching $1 billion. However, to trigger a 
fast revitalization of all industrial sectors would take $3 
billion, and the total cost of the process is put at $15 
billion. "It is clear for everybody", CRONICA ROMANA notes, 
"that the most important thing now is to find solutions for 
capital injection in view of updating the industry". "We are 
vitally interested in attracting foreign capital", said 
Industries Minister Dumitru Popescu. "We have promoted a bill to 
this end for the attraction of investors bringing funds of over 
$50 million since we have had enough of petty investors".

zone, Galati city can become one of the important turntable of 
Europe for the flow of goods," said the Galati County deputy- 
prefect. He said also that the decision to establish the zone 
was grounded mainly on the Galati Port's ideal transit position 
in the vicinity of the border with the Republic of Moldova and 
with Ukraine, thus with direct links to the CIS market, with 
direct links to both the Eastern and Western Europe, plus 
possibilities of links through the Danube and the Black Sea with

  ILIESCU, SAMSUNG TALK: On Friday, 13 May, President Ion 
Iliescu received a delegation of the Samsung company from the 
Republic of Korea, led by the general executive manager for 
Europe. The purpose of the Korean delegation's visit to Romania 
is to discuss the development of cooperation with its 
representative in Romania, ANA Electronic. That relationship is 
evidenced by a factory that assembles electronic products in 
Romania, and is capable of producing 100,000 color television 
sets annually. The assembly line will be ready for commission 
by the end of June this year. After the meeting with the 
Romanian president, the head of the delegation said that the 
main topics related to Samsung's cooperation projects in 
Romania, which permit multiple expansion opportunities, mostly 
in the production of basic electronic sub-assemblies, and that 
other programs were yet to be developed between the Romanian 
manufacturer and its South Korean partner. (Bucharest ROMPRES

  ELECTRONICS: There is a revitalization of Romanian 
electronics, writes the daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. That sector's 
exports in 1993 amounted to $165 million. The privatization of 
the electronics industry has started yielding fruit. Seventy 
joint ventures with foreign capital were set up, including 48 
production units, with the remainder handling trade activities. 
The major investors are France, 11 companies; Italy, eight; and 
Germany, six. Activities include: 20 design, marketing, and 
consulting services, 10 producers of consumer goods, and eight 
telecommunications. There are also two companies in the process 
of being licensed, while with Daewoo and ABB negotiations are 
being conducted on establishing joint ventures with Bucharest 
Acumulatorul, UM Tohan-Zarnesti, Ice-Felix Computere, and AEM 
Timisoara. So far there are 13 completely privatized companies 
in that sector. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1704 GMT 16 May

  MINISTER ON IMPORTS, EXPORTS: Minister of Industries Dumitru 
Popescu stated in an interview: "Romanian industry has always 
had traditional partners in Europe and Central Asia, and it has 
developed various forms of international economic cooperation 
and foreign trade such as: import of technology and equipment 
from developed European countries, particularly in machine 
building, chemistry, metallurgy and so on; export of industrial 
finished products to European and Central Asian countries 
(metallurgical, chemical and petrochemical products, tractors, 
machine tools, bearings, building materials, etc.); turn-key 
projects by Romanian companies together with leader European 
companies for complex objectives in Central Asia (a good example 
being Iran); export of services in the industrial field -- 
consulting, technical assistance -- in Central Asian countries 
and construction-installation works in Europe. Exports to those 
areas, out of Romania's total exports, account for 39 percent to 
countries of the European Union and for 15 percent to Central 
Asian countries. Imports from the above-mentioned areas, out of 
Romania's total imports, account for 42 percent from European 
Union countries and for 5 percent from countries in Central 
Asia. Romanian industry is currently undergoing a transition to 
a market economy, which requires certain measures for its 
restructuring, modernization, and redevelopment, concurrently 
with measures for stepping up its privatisation." (Bucharest

  SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH: "Two percent of the gross domestic 
product would be enough to finance the national programme for 
research and development and to complete its projects," said 
Minister of Research and Technology Doru Dumitru Palade. He is 
of the opinion that half of the 2 percent could come from the 
state budget and the other half through direct contracts with 
beneficiaries of the work carried out by scientific research 
units. In this context, Doru Dumitru Palade mentioned that "the 
most severe issue" confronting Romanian scientific research is 
financing. Referring to the priorities in Romanian scientific 
research, the Romanian minister indicates as the main fields 
ecology, health care, agriculture, silviculture, food industry, 
information technology, communications, and transportation.

company to analyze the unfolding of the credit agreement signed 
between Romtelecom and the EBRD. The delegation headed by Clell 
Harral, director of the EBRD Telecommunications Division, 
analyzed and established together with the Romanian party the 
timetable for the use and unfolding of the second installment of 
the credit, soon to be released. They discussed fast 
development of telecommunications in Romania and the necessary 
financial resources. Also considered was the possibility of the 
EBRD's further backing of the development by co-financing, 
together with the World Bank, and possibly with the European 
Investments Bank. A plan to secure financing sources to 
continue the development of telecommunications over 1995-1998

  TRADE WITH POLAND DECLINES: Poland presently holds a modest 
place on the list of Romania's major trade partners after 
ranking third until 1989. In 1993 the volume of trade was put 
at merely $63 million. In an attempt to discover the causes 
leading to this situation, a ROMPRES editor turned to the 
commercial counselor of the Polish embassy in Bucharest, 
Grzegorz Matusiewicz, and to Mircea Toader, a director in the 
Romanian Ministry of Commerce. The Polish diplomat sees the 
situation as due to "a reform in economic instruments and the 
fundamental changes in the economic policies of Poland and 
Romania after 1989." "We consider that as far as Romania's debt 
of 47.1 million rubles is concerned, it could be repaid in 
Romanian products, for which Polish partners are showing 
interest," the Polish diplomat added, adding that "in the 
beginning, part of it could be covered by promotional 
activities." "The Romanian market is showing the same interest 
in Polish investments as other markets do." In turn, Mircea 
Toader showed that "the idea that came out of the talks with the 
Polish partners was that the future of our bilateral economic 
relations depends on the debt's being written off. We wish to 
return it in the supply of goods. We consider it necessary to 
reach a free trade agreement. If not, the level of customs 
duties could become an extremely heavy burden on Romanian-Polish 
trade, Toader said. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1920 GMT 20

  WESTERN LOANS VIEWED: In an article entitled "The West Has 
Released Credits to Romania" the daily ADEVARUL of 23 May 
comments on the significance of the new credits, which top the 
$1 billion mark, cautioning, however, that the country's foreign 
debt thus reaches about $4.3 billion, and wonders whether the 
government will at long last trigger the economic restructuring 
with this money. After the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has 
granted the first installment, worth $316 of the Stand-By 
Agreement, the World Bank released a restructuring loan worth 
$175 million. At the same time the Group of 24 assessed at its 
Brussels meeting that loans worth over $1 billion should be 
given to Romania in 1994, including the credits from the IMF, 
the World Bank, and the group of 24 itself. Adding to the money 
already issued by the respective financial bodies last week, 
there is a new long-term loan worth $250 million from the World 
Bank for the restructuring and privatization of industry and 
banking, which will be released next October. ADEVARUL says 
that this avalanche of credits marks a change in the West's 
views on Romania, being matched by an appreciation of the 
government's and the national bank's financial-economic policy.

  APRIL FOREIGN TRADE: According to a release of the National 
Statistics Board, Romanian hard currency exports amounted to 
$475 million in April, that is 3.9 percent less than in March, 
but 94.6 percent higher than in April 1993. Imports increased 
to $467.1 million, that is 6.3 percent more than in March and 
56.6 percent more than in April 1993. Overall imports for the 
first four months in 1994 totalled $1,409.2 million. The import 
figures for the first four months of this year do not include 
the 2,677,800 tonnes of imported crude oil (worth some $241.2 
million), since customs clearing documents for these imports 
have not yet been completed. (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 1300

  LARGE SCALE PRIVATIZATION: Iacob Zelenco, president of the 
National Privatization Agency announced that large scale 
privatization in the economy will actually start on 1 July. 
Selective privatization will be replaced by an increased public 
offer of commercial companies put out for sale. The offer will 
cover whole sectors of the economy that can go private at a fast 
pace: consumer goods, tourism, trade, building materials, 
medicines, and cosmetics. Sectors with common characteristics 
are taken into consideration for this action: the production is 
based on domestic raw materials and is mainly designed for 
domestic consumption; there is a fast circulation of capital and 
no financial problems as a rule; and the branches are also 
attractive to foreign investors. The mass privatization will 
probably start on 1 July this year, when the National 
Privatization Agency and the World Bank experts are expected to 
have completed the necessary preparations. (Bucharest ROMPRES 
in English 0915 GMT 27 May 94) 
  SAVINGS CURB INFLATION: The wise interest rates policy 
implemented by the National Bank of Romania in the past few 
months has increased the citizens' trust in depositing their 
domestic currency earnings with the banks -- the only exception 
being the state savings system known as CEC [expansion unknown]. 
This policy has determined a spectacular ninefold growth of 
bank savings from 20 billion lei in November 1993 to 178 billion 
in April 1994, which is indicative of the confidence the banks 
have earned among the average depositor. The situation has had a 
two-fold effect on inflation. First it curbed the tendency to 
purchase and hoard goods and convertible currency as protection 
against the depreciation of the leu. Second it provides the 
national economy with a noninflationary crediting pipeline. This 
new development has facilitated the return of the domestic 
currency market to normal, leading to the natural death of the 
dual exchange rates operating until not so long ago: the first 
one on the official bank and exchange offices market, and the 
other one the black market. This also signals the start of a 
process of price normalization, which always depends on the rate 
of exchange. Nevertheless, this balancing of prices will have to 
be considered in its dynamic evolution, by further allowing the 
U.S. dollar's current exchange rate to fluctuate in keeping with 
the rate of inflation (Bucharest ROMPRES in English 0805 GMT 30 
May 94) 
  HARD CURRENCY RESERVES: According to figures released by the 
National Bank, Romania's hard currency reserves increased from 
$20 million to $600 million within five months. Such a 
spectacular leap would not have been possible without the recent 
agreement concluded with the IMF, which has helped the Romanian 
economy come out of its predicament. The progressive growth of 
Romanian exports and of public confidence in the monetary and 
currency policies of the National Bank of Romania have boosted 
the deposits of local residents with the merchant banks to 
$1,087 million by the end of April 1994. Compared to an 
aggregate $13 million personal savings in Romanian banks prior 
to 1989, individual deposits in hard currency in Romanian banks 
now exceed the figure of $250 million. The overall cash 
availabilities at national level stand at $1.5 billion, an 
amount that can cover three months' imports. All these positive 
developments, particularly in the foreign trade activity, are 
also reflected in the country's balance of foreign payments, 
where the deficit has been cut from $414 million dollars to $36 
million within one year. A contribution to this remarkable 
improvement was made by direct investments of foreign capital, 
which grew to $102 million dollars in the first quarter 1994 
from $25 million in the equivalent period last year. (Bucharest

  COAL IMPORTS, PRODUCTION: The state-owned Hornonitrianske 
Bane, the Upper Nitra Valley mining company, wants the Slovak 
Government to restrict coal imports from the Czech Republic so 
that it can maintain its mining operations and workforce, said 
company marketing director Fedor Boroska. The mining company 
contends that the Czech coal is of a lower quality, containing 
more sulfur, and is thus cheaper than Slovak coal. It needs to 
increase sales to customers who are now purchasing Czech coal by 
600,000 metric tons in order to maintain full production, and is 
hoping that the Slovak Ministry of the Environment will set 
punitive fees for imports of coal with high amounts of sulfur, 
said Boroska. But Ivan Akivanov, the director of Palimpex, a 
Slovak trading company which sells coal from Czech suppliers, 
says that low sales of Slovak coal are due to the reduced demand 
of the main Slovak coal customers. Akivanov told reporters on 26 
April that energy companies which had separated from Slovensky 
Energeticky Podnik (SEP) had signed contracts this year for 
power supplies from foreign firms, thus cutting demand for 
domestic coal. Akivanov also denied that Czech coal generally 
contained a higher amount of sulfur, and said that its price was 
gradually increasing to match that of Slovak coal. But he 
admitted that coal from the Sokolov mine in Bohemia contained 
more sulfur. Representatives of Hornonitrianske Bane contend 
that a law tariffing imports of coal with a high sulfur content 
already exists in the Czech Republic, and they see the tariffs 
as necessary to bring up the Czech price. Slovak Economy 
Minister Peter Magvasi told reporters on April 5 after meeting 
with labor and business representatives that his ministry was 
going to accept measures for increasing Slovak coal sales. He 
said that this could be accomplished within the GATT agreement, 
and at the time did not rule out controls on the quality of 
imported coal. Palimpex Director Akivanov, however, said that 
Slovakia's attempts to copy Czech restrictions on imports of 
sulfurous coal were nonsensical. Domestic mines can only meet 40 
percent of Slovakia's requirements for coal, and import 
restrictions "would cause not only growth in the price of coal, 
but also its lack," said Akivanov. (Prague CTK in English 1854 
GMT 26 Apr 94) The three Slovak coal mining companies employ 
12,000 people and extract 3.7 to 4 million metric tons of brown 
coal a year. Coal mining at the level of 3.5 to 3.7 million 
metric tons a year can be maintained until 2,000 to 2005. The 
largest mining company -- the state-owned Hornonitrianske Bane 
(Upper Nitra Valley Mines) with its head office in Prievidza -- 
extracts in its three mines (Cigel, Handlova, Novaky) about 75 
percent of Slovakia's brown coal output and employs 8,500 
people. About 70 percent of Slovakia's brown coal output, 2.5 
million metric tons, is consumed by the Novaky power station, 
the remaining 30 percent is made up of graded coal and is 
consumed by the population. Subsidies to mining companies have 
declined from Sk1.3 to 1.5 billion in the past to a mere Sk132 
million this year. Slovakia's brown coal consumption averages 
about 9 million metric tons; the difference between consumption 
and domestic production is covered by imports from the Czech 
Republic, on which Sk4.5 billion were spent in 1993. Imported 
Czech coal (which comes from open-pit mines) is about Sk170 per 
metric ton cheaper than domestically produced coal (which comes 
from underground mines), and this has cut demand for domestic 
coal. The Hornonitrianske Bane state enterprise currently has 
about 200,000 metric tons of unsold coal in stock, for which it 
must find a buyer if it wants to maintain its mining operations 
and work force. Fedor Boroska, the company's marketing director, 
wants the state to buy this coal as a "strategic contingency 
reserve." According to Boroska, Slovak coal mines are able to 
secure the sale of about 3.1 million metric tons of coal this 
year but expect the Ministry of Economy's help in marketing the 
remaining approximately 600,000 metric tons that will be mined 
this year. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 6 May 94 p 5) 
  RAIL INFORMATION, CONTROL SYSTEMS: At its meeting on 14 
April the Slovak Government agreed to guarantee an $11.5 million 
credit for the introduction of "information and control systems 
for freight and passenger rail transportation." The systems 
will be supplied by the British firm Digital Equipment Slovakia 
and the financial resources will be provided by the London 
branch of Societe General. Slovak Railroads will start paying 
off the seven-year credit, which is expected to be released in 
May or June this year, in 1996. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 26 Apr 
94 p 3) 
  BUS LINKS TO VIENNA: As of 29 May, the number of bus links 
between Vienna and Bratislava will increase to six per day in 
both directions. An agreement to this effect has been reached 
by E. Binda, director of Slovak Automobile Transportation (SAD), 
and F. Bittmann, director of Austrian Federal Railroads (OeBB). 
The increased density meets the wishes of commuters, tourists, 
Slovak users of Schwechat airport, and culture enthusiasts. The 
last bus will leave Vienna at 2230, which will allow Bratislava 
residents to attend theater performances and concerts in Vienna. 
The round-trip fare for Slovak citizens is 184 Slovak korunas 
(Sk). (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 27 Apr 94 p 3) 
  WATER RETENTION: Engineer Vojtech Dalos's team from the 
Petrochemistry Research Institute in Prievidza has completed the 
development of "agrosorb," a "polymeric preparation for the 
retention of water for agricultural purposes," which is 
currently being tested in Arab countries. The chief advantages 
of this "unique novelty for turning deserts into gardens" are 
its capacity to absorb large quantities of water (300 to 500 
grams per one gram of agrosorb) and its relatively low price 
(Sk120 per kilogram). The Prievidza institute plans to produce 
about 100 tonnes of agrosorb annually but is willing to provide 
documentation for the construction of a large production 
facility, should a partner be found. Agrosorb will be exhibited 
for the first time at the Incheba fair in Bratislava. 
(Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 27 Apr 94 p 3) 
  LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION: Milk production in 1993 fell 116.2 
million liters (8.7 percent) short of the 1992 figure, mainly as 
a result of a 10.8 percent decline in the number of dairy cows. 
The milk yield per cow, on the other hand, went up 2.3 percent. 
An even greater decline, of 11.3 percent, was registered in the 
production of eggs. Production of wool was 25.2 percent lower 
than in 1992 and production of sheep cheese 2.7 percent lower. 
(Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 27 Apr 94 p 4) 
  HEALTH PRIVATIZATION LAGS: The Ministry of Health has issued 
307 authorizations to run a private practice to date, 227 of 
them for dentists and the rest for dermatologists, 
gynecologists, general practitioners, and psychiatrists. The 
overwhelming majority insist on cash payment because contracts 
with the National Insurance Company, the only insurance company 
in Slovakia, are disadvantageous for them. According to V. Zak, 
director of the ministry's Health Care Section, health services 
are thus the only sector in Slovakia that remains under 
virtually complete state control. By comparison, according to 
Czech Ministry of Health data, as many as 20 health insurance 
companies operate in the Czech Republic and 10 hospitals, 2 
maternity clinics, more than 2,670 general outpatient clinics, 
and 2,322 specialized outpatient clinics have been privatized. 
Moreover, there are 3,827 private dentists, more than 670 
private gynecologists, and 345 private pharmacies in the Czech 
Republic, as well as private nursing schools, a private 
ambulance service, and private homes for the chronically ill. 
While salaries in Slovak health care average 4,930 Slovak 
korunas, physicians in Czech state hospitals earn an average of 
10,000 Czech korunas and nurses an average of 7,000 korunas. 
(Bratislava SME in Slovak 28 Apr 94 p 2) 
  EBRD STAKE: The management of the London-based European Bank 
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has decided to take a 
stake in the Bratislava-based Tatra Banka a.s. According to 
Milan Vrskovy, director general of Tatra Banka, the bank's 
capital stock will be increased by at least Sk100 million so 
that the EBRD's stake should reach about 19 percent. The 
largest shareholder in Tatra Banka, whose capital stock amounts 
to Sk400 million, is now the Austrian Raiffeisenzentralbank 
(47.2 percent). The largest domestic shareholders are Vseobecna 
Uverova Banka (General Credit Bank, VUB) and Slovenska 
Sporitelna (Slovak Savings Bank) with 11 percent each. 
Discussions are currently being held to obtain the current 
shareholders' consent to lower their share in connection with 
the EBRD's entry. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 29

  ELECTRICITY GRID: The operation of the Slovak Power Control 
Board (Slovensky Energeticky Dispecing, SED) was officially 
inaugurated in Zilina on 29 April in the presence of Rudolf 
Kvetan, director general of the Slovak Energy Company (Slovensky 
Energeticky Podnik, SEP). The SED, which has actually been in 
operation since 1 April, when the almost 45 years of joint 
operation of the Czech and Slovak electricity grids from Prague 
came to an end, thus assumed full control over the Slovak 
electricity grid, including exchanges with other national grids. 
The Slovak grid has an "installed capacity" of 6,830 megawatts 
and supplies the national economy with approximately 25 million 
megawatt hours annually. Its 400 kilovolt power transmission 
system consists of 1,520 km of transmission lines and the 220 
kilovolt power transmission system of 964 km of transmission 
lines. The 400 kilovolt transmission system will be integrated 
into the West European system of transit and exchange of 
electricity (UCPTE) by 1997. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in

  HOTEL BEDS: As of 30 June 1993, there were 40,800 beds in 
"commercial hotel facilities" in Slovakia, 4,500 beds in 
"commercial non-hotel facilities," 4,500 beds in trade unions' 
recreational facilities, 10,900 beds in spas, 50,000 beds in 
company-owned recreational facilities, and some 200,000 beds in 
private recreational facilities, according to data of the 
Tourism Section operating under the Slovak Ministry of Economy. 
Some 65,000 people are employed in tourism services and an 
additional approximately 100,000 people in auxiliary services. 
Foreign exchange earnings from tourism amounted to $344.8 
million in 1993, but the Tourism Section expects them to reach 
$600 million by 1996. According to Lucia Rozborova, press 
secretary of the Tourism Section, the so-called small-scale 
privatization in tourism, which involved 2,700 "operational 
units," has been wound up. Two state enterprises -- Interhotel 
Tatry and Interhotel Bratislava -- will be privatized within the 
second wave of privatization. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in 
Slovak 29 Apr 94 p 4; Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 2 May

  CZECH BANK MAIN SHAREHOLDER: After the annual meeting of 
shareholders of the Otcina insurance company, held on 25 April, 
the Czech Agrobanka Prague became the main shareholder in 
Otcina, with 36.1 percent. The other shareholders are the 
Austrian Bundeslaender Versicherung and the Slovak Ministry of 
Agriculture. Otcina, which offers its clients a range of 40 
insurance products, operates 19 branches in Slovakia and the 
Czech Republic. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 29 Apr 94 p 2) 
  BRITISH LOAN: According to Julius Binder, director general 
of Vodohospodarska Vystavba (Hydraulic Engineering Works) 
Bratislava, the company has obtained a $15 million credit from 
an unspecified "London bank" to finance the completion of the 
second stage of the Gabcikovo hydroelectric power project. The 
rate of interest is 9 percent. (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 
30 Apr 94 p 2) 
  BUS PRODUCTION WITH HUNGARY: Preparations for the 
establishment of Ikarus-Asko, a joint Hungarian-Slovak venture 
for the production of buses, have almost been completed. The 
joint venture, the seat of which will be in Kosice, will be 
involved in the assembly of Ikarus buses for the Slovak market, 
using components made in Slovakia. In its first year of 
operation, Ikarus-Asko plans to assemble 35 buses; in subsequent 
years, it plans to increase the number to 50. (Bratislava SMENA 
in Slovak 30 Apr 94 p 5) 
  CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE REDUCED: Ivan Steis, head of the 
Building Production and Marketing Department at the Slovak 
Ministry of Economy, told the daily PRAVDA that the workforce in 
construction has dropped from 240,000 in 1990 to today's 
115,000. Of those 115,000, Steis said, 30,000 to 50,000 are 
"artificially employed," that is, they could be made redundant 
if the level of labor productivity were "optimal." In the 
ministry official's opinion, besides the conversion of the arms 
industry, the decline of the construction branch currently 
represents the biggest problem of the Slovak economy. The 
volume of building output continues to decline by 30 to 40 
percent annually. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 2 May 94 pp 1, 5) 
  FOREIGN TRADE DEFICIT: Slovak exports amounted to Sk15.286 
billion and Slovak imports to Sk15.321 billion in March 1994, 
according to data provided by Jaromir Kalincak, director general 
of the Central Customs Administration. Slovak foreign trade for 
the first three months of the year shows a deficit, with exports 
(Sk43.554 billion) falling more than Sk3.7 billion short of 
imports (Sk47.297 billion). (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 
3 May 94 p 6) 
  WASTE DISPOSAL: Some 8 million tonnes of brown and red mud 
have accumulated in the four decades of the operation of the 
aluminum plant at Ziar nad Hronom. To prevent the spreading of 
pollutants contained in the mud, a huge bentonite "tub" will be 
built at a cost of Sk140 million. The entire waste disposal 
site will cover an area of 40 hectares, with the walls reaching 
35 to 38 meters above ground level. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 
3 May 94 p 1) The implementation of this ecological project is 
a condition set by the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development for releasing the first $40 million installment of a 
credit for the modernization of aluminum production at Ziar nad 
Hronom. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 3 May 94 p 2) 
  PRIVATE FARMING: Milan Pasmik, chairman of the Association 
of Land Owners and Agricultural Entrepreneurs of Slovakia, 
estimates that 12,500 to 13,000 private farmers are engaged in 
primary agricultural production as their sole source of income 
and another 5,500 to 6,000 farmers, mostly in mountainous areas, 
are engaged in farming, particularly raising livestock, while 
simultaneously being employed elsewhere. (Bratislava SME in 
Slovak 4 May 94 p 5) 
  TRADE MISSION IN CROATIA: An 80-member Slovak trade mission, 
the largest ever of its kind, arrived in Zagreb on 2 May with 
the aim of establishing contacts with Croatian partners. Croatia 
is one of only a few countries, with which Slovakia has a trade 
surplus. Trade turnover between the two countries reached a 
volume of $58 million in 1993, with Slovakia exporting $45 
million worth of goods (mostly metallurgical products, tractors, 
beef cattle, and meat) and importing $13 million worth of goods 
(chemicals and preparations for the food industry). (Bratislava 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 4 May 94 pp 1, 2; Bratislava

  POWER FOR IRON WORKS: "Comprehensive testing" of a new small 
hydroelectric power station on the Hornad river at Mlynsky nahon 
near Kosice started on 3 May. Once fully operative, the power 
station, which was built at a cost of Sk29 million, will supply 
electricity to the East Slovak Iron Works. (Bratislava 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 4 May 94 p 2) 
  FEWER POTATOES: Whereas in 1993 potatoes were grown on more 
than 16,000 hectares in Slovakia, this year they will be grown 
on only 14,600 hectares, according to the Association of Potato 
Growers-Slovsolanum. The declining interest in seed potatoes, 
which is associated with the unfavorable financial situation of 
agricultural cooperatives and the resulting marketing problems 
of growers, is particularly striking. Whereas in the early 
nineties seed potatoes were grown on about 6,000 hectares in 
Slovakia, last year they were harvested from only 2,480 
hectares. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 4 May 94 p 3) 
  MONETARY REPORT: The Slovak National Bank (NBS) Banking 
Council approved on 4 May the "Report on Monetary Development in 
the Slovak Republic in 1993." The report states that the 
current account of the balance of payments ended with a deficit 
of $559 million in 1993, while the Slovak Republic's overall 
balance ended in a surplus of $58.5 million. The deficit of the 
current account of the balance of payments affected the 
development of indebtedness. The Slovak Republic's overall 
gross indebtedness in foreign exchange (Slovak Government, NBS, 
and commercial sector) increased from $2.98 billion on 1 January 
1993 to $3.62 billion by the end of the year (including debt to 
the Czech Republic). The NBS's total foreign exchange reserves 
(including gold assessed in book value) increased in the course 
of 1993 from $410 million to $468.5 million and commercial 
banks' reserves from $491 million to $953 million. (Bratislava 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 5 May 94 p 2) 
  PENSION INCREASES: The average old-age pension went up from 
1,432 korunas in 1989 to Sk2,367 at the end of 1993. By 
comparison, average wages increased in the same period from 
3,090 korunas to Sk5,352. The increase in the average old-age 
pension (65.5 percent) thus trailed behind the increase in 
average wages (73.2 percent). It trailed even more markedly 
behind the growth in the cost of living. The cost of living 
index for pensioners' households rose 148.2 percent between 1 
January 1989 and 31 December 1993. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE 
NOVINY in Slovak 5 May 94 p 7) 
  CONSUMER PRICES: Consumer prices went up 0.5 percent in 
March 1994, compared with February, according to Slovak 
Statistical Office data. Food prices went up 0.1 percent, 
prices of services 0.5 percent, prices of non-food items 0.6 
percent, and prices of restaurant meals 1.1 percent. The slower 
growth of food prices was caused by a 0.3 percent decrease in 
meat prices and a 6.3 percent decrease in the price of eggs. 
The prices of other food products increased by between 0.2 
percent (alcoholic beverages) and 2 percent (oils and fats). 
Consumer prices at the end of March were 2.0 percent higher 
than at the end of December 1993. While food prices increased 
only 1.5 percent in the first quarter of 1994, prices of 
non-food items went up 1.9 percent, prices of restaurant meals 
2.6 percent, and prices of public services 3.0 percent. The 
development of consumer prices also affected the development of 
the cost of living index. The cost of living in farmers' 
households went up 0.5 percent in March, compared with February, 
in employees' households 0.4 percent, and in pensioners' 
households 0.3 percent. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 
5 May 94 p 8) 
  COMPANY LOSS: The Vychodoslovenske Strojarne (East Slovak 
Engineering Works, VSS) a.s. incurred a loss of Sk37 million in 
the first quarter of the year, Sk15 million more than expected. 
The company has more than Sk500 million tied up in inventories, 
Sk126 million of which are unsold finished products. Despite the 
opening of new possibilities on the Chinese market, where VSS 
wants to export building machinery, the management had to 
introduce a four-day working week (Monday through Thursday) from 
mid-April until the end of May, following an agreement with the 
trade union organization. (Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak 6 May

  PRIVATE SCHOOLS: Of the 179 high schools in Slovakia, 26 are 
church-run and 11 private; of the 340 specialized secondary 
schools, 11 are church-run and 9 private; and of the 327 
secondary vocational schools, 4 are church-run and 12 private.

  PRICES ALTER EATING HABITS: The liberalization of food 
prices 
has brought about major changes in the eating habits of the 
population in the last three years, some of which may have an 
adverse long-term impact on the population's health. Per capita 
consumption of meat, for example, declined from 84.0 kg in 1989 
to 70.4 kg in 1992, consumption of poultry from 15.2 to 12.8 kg, 
consumption of milk from 115.7 to 91.9 kg, consumption of cheese 
from 6.6 to 4.4 kg, consumption of butter from 6.8 to 4.2 kg, 
consumption of cereals from 112.1 to 104.0 kg, and consumption 
of fruit from 60.0 to 58.0 kg. On the other hand, there have 
been increases in the consumption of sugar (from 34.8 to 38.6 
kg), potatoes (from 77.6 to 80.0 kg), pulses (from 1.9 to 2.2 
kg), and vegetables (from 106.0 to 107.0 kg). (Bratislava 
REPUBLIKA ZDRAVOTNICTVO Supplement in Slovak 7 May 94 p 3) 
  MINE PRIVATIZATION: On 7 May, employees of the Dolina Mine 
in 
Velky Krtis set up a shareholding company, the first in the 
mining sector in Slovakia, with the aim of privatizing the mine. 
The shareholding company's capital stock represents more than 1 
million Slovak korunas (Sk), to which the approximately 1,500 
employees of the mine contributed Sk500 each and the top and 
middle- level management the remaining 30 percent. The company 
seeks the privatization of the state-owned mine, the book value 
of which represents Sk530 million, for a "symbolic price." It 
promises to "stabilize the workforce" of the Dolina Mine, the 
largest employer in Velky Krtis district, which has one of the 
highest rates of unemployment in Slovakia (over 24 percent). 
The mine plans to extract 600,000 metric tons of coal this 
year. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 9 May 94 p 5; Bratislava

  CLOTHING EXPORTER: The Ozeta Trencin a.s., the largest 
manufacturer of men's ready-made clothes in Slovakia, more than 
doubled its profits in 1993, to Sk51.5 million. Ozeta, which is 
one of 10 companies whose shares are quoted on the listed market 
of the Bratislava Securities Exchange (BCPB), produced 2,892,000 
pieces of clothing in 1993, 92 percent of which it exported. 
The biggest export markets are the Benelux countries, the 
destination of 30 percent of Ozeta's exports, followed by other 
West European countries (23.8 percent), and the United States 
and Canada (21.3 percent). The company, which invested more 
than Sk138 million last year, expects to increase output 10 
percent and profits 30 percent this year. (Bratislava SLOVENSKY 
DENNIK in Slovak 10 May 94 p 4) 
  HARVEST RESULTS: The extremely dry weather in 1993, coupled 
with the shortage of quality inputs as a result of the 
insolvency of agricultural companies, adversely affected the 
1993 harvest. Even though the area under grain crops was 
expanded by more than 36,000 hectares (to 845,000 hectares), the 
harvest fell 400,400 metric tons short of the 1992 harvest and 
765,600 metric tons short of the 1990-1992 average. The harvest 
of leguminous crops was equally weak; it totalled 123,000 metric 
tons, which was 34,600 metric tons (22 percent) less than the 
year before. Production of beans and lentils declined more than 
50 percent. In spite of an increase in the area under oil- 
bearing crops to 71,300 hectares, the production of oil seeds 
reached only 124,000 metric tons, which was 7,100 metric tons 
less than in 1992 and 86,500 metric tons less than in 1991. The 
dry weather affected, in particular, sunflowers, the per-hectare 
yield of which reached only two metric tons. The sugar beet 
harvest totalled 1.128 million metric tons, which represented a 
per-hectare yield of 34.26 metric tons. Sugar beets were 
harvested from 32,900 hectares last year, compared with 
approximately 45,000 the year before. On the other hand, there 
was a good harvest of potatoes. It reached 856,700 metric tons 
and the per-hectare yield of 18.15 metric tons was 5.3 metric 
tons higher than in 1992. To reduce the potato glut, the State 
Market Regulation Fund purchased 100,000 metric tons of potatoes 
for export. Only 18,200 metric tons have been actually exported 
and 78,800 metric tons are still in warehouses, of which more 
than 7,000 metric tons are no longer suitable for human 
consumption. The extremely dry weather also influenced the 
production of bulk fodder. Converted to hay, the harvest of 
bulk fodder totalled 3.28 million metric tons and fell 422,300 
metric tons short of the 1992 harvest. (Bratislava SLOVENSKY 
DENNIK in Slovak 10 May 94 p 8) 
  SHEEP REDUCTION: The number of sheep in Slovakia has 
declined from 750,000 in 1988 to 250,000 this year. The main 
reason for the declining interest in sheep farming is the 
reduction in the procurement price of wool. As a result of the 
reduced number of sheep, some 200,000 hectares of pastures and 
meadows are not in use and are overgrowing with weeds. 
(Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 10 May 94 p 6) 
  ECOLOGICAL COMPRESSORS: A new production facility for 
"ecological compressors" was put into operation in the Calex 
a.s. refrigerator plant at Zlate Moravce on 10 May. The 
compressors, which are free of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), will 
be made under license TO the South Korean Samsung Electronics 
company. The annual capacity of the plant is more than 1.5 
million units. The project, which required an investment of 
more than Sk8 billion, is the largest investment project in the 
Slovak consumer goods industry. It should raise Calex's ability 
to compete internationally as Germany and the Czech Republic, 
for example, have banned the import of refrigerators and 
freezers containing CFCs. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in 
Slovak 10 May 94 p 3) 
  VSZ PAYS DIVIDENDS: The annual meeting of shareholders of 
the 
largest Slovak company, the East Slovak Iron Works (VSZ), was 
convened in Kosice on 10 May to discuss and approve the 
company's annual report. According to the report, the company's 
proceeds went up from Sk3.119 billion in 1992 to Sk5.219 billion 
in 1993, while costs went up from Sk2.889 billion to Sk5.024 
billion. The company thus made an after-tax profit of 
approximately Sk196 million, which was 82.7 percent of the 
projected profit of Sk236 million. The general meeting decided 
that the sum of almost Sk154 million be paid out in dividends. 
This represents approximately Sk9 for each of the more than 
16.5 million VSZ shares. The dividend will be paid out on 15 
October 1994 to those shareholders who were in possession of VSZ 
shares at the end of 1993. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 11 May 94 
pp 1, 2) In the first quarter of 1994, VSZ made a profit of 
Sk462 million, which is 186 percent of the profit planned for 
the whole year. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 11 May 
94 pp 1, 2) 
  LAYOFF PROTEST: Some 2,000 trade unionists and employees of 
the SES (Slovak Power Engineering Works) Tlmace company 
demonstrated in Tlmace on 10 May against the management's 
proposal to lay off 426 employees. The management cites "lack 
of orders" as the reason for the layoffs. The demonstrators, 
however, blame the top management for the company's current 
problems. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 11 May 94 p 2) 
  ARMS INDUSTRY JOB LOSSES: Jozef Krumpolec, chairman of KOVO, 
the trade union of metal workers, estimates that 44,000 people 
in Slovakia have lost their jobs due to the conversion of the 
arms industry. (Bratislava HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Slovak 11 May 
94 p 2) 
  BANKS ENDANGERED: Citing "well-informed sources," the 
Bratislava daily PRAVDA reported that "at least three major 
banks in the Slovak Republic" are "endangered" and "may soon 
face problems similar to those of Banka Bohemia and its numerous 
depositors in neighboring Czech Republic." According to the 
unnamed source, the banks' credits are covered by real estate 
collateral whose value falls drastically short of the value of 
the extended loans, often on the basis of "greatly overvalued" 
expert appraisals of real estate. The three banks reportedly 
also concluded credit agreements with clients, "about whom it is 
generally known that they do not pay off previously extended 
loans." According to PRAVDA, "an important role is played by 
bribes. The commission for the bank employee is approximately 
10 percent of the loaned amount." Another common practice, 
according to PRAVDA, is to reschedule loans instead of demanding 
outstanding payments in court. This creates the impression that 
the bank has no outstanding claims, which "distorts the actual 
situation in the bank's conduct of economic affairs." 
(Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 11 May 94 pp 1, 3) 
  FACTORY WORKERS STRIKE: The approximately 700 employees of 
the Euroobuv footwear plant in Komarno went on strike on 11 May. 
They demand a 40-percent increase in base pay, "decent 
treatment" by the management, and the provision of protective 
gear. (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 12 May 94 p 2) 
Euroobuv is a subsidiary of a German footwear concern with 
production plants all over Europe. It leased the Komarno plant 
from the SIPOX company and is now in only its second month of 
operation. The management has offered to raise the base pay by 
Sk300 and to peg any additional pay increases to performance. 
While the strikers' representatives claim that the performance 
norms are "scarcely fulfillable," the management is of the 
opinion that "every worker should be able to start exceeding 
them within three months," once he masters the new technology. 
Meanwhile, the gap between the management and the strikers seems 
to be widening. The management gave all protesters an immediate 
notice "because of breach of labor discipline." It is willing 
to rehire everyone who is ready to accept its terms. (Bratislava 
PRAVDA in Slovak 13 May 94 pp 1, 2) 
  STOCK MARKET DROPS: Share prices on the Bratislava 
Securities Exchange continued to decline in April. The SIX 30 
index (comprising the 30 largest industrial companies) dropped 
from 1,330.79 on 8 April (highest April value) to 917.73 on 26 
April (lowest April value); the SIX 50 index (comprising the 50 
largest companies, including banks and other non- industrial 
companies) dropped from 1,416.20 to 1,028.10; and the SIX ALL 
index (comprising all publicly traded companies) dropped from 
966.51 to 752.43. The decline continued in the first days of 
May. By 11 May, the SIX 30 index dropped to 868.47, the SIX 50 
index to 983.08, and the SIX ALL index to 713.21. (Bratislava 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY BURZOVE NOVINY Supplement 12 May 94 pp 1, 3) 
  VW TO RAISE INVESTMENT: Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus 
received the management of the Volkswagen Bratislava company 
(VW) on 12 May. The management informed the minister of the 
planned increase in the company's base capital by 49 million 
German marks [DM], which will increase the German concern's 
stake in the company to DM100 million. (Bratislava PRAVDA in 
Slovak 13 May 94 p 2) 
  GLASS FACTORY STRIKE ALERT: Employees of the Skloobal 
Nemsova a.s. went on "strike alert" on 10 May to draw attention 
to the urgent need for the general overhaul of one of the glass 
tanks for the production of container glass. The company's 
trade union organization warns that a possible accident would 
put the plant out of operation for a long time. It demands that 
the National Property Fund, which owns 100 percent of Skloobal's 
shares, take over the financial guarantee for the project. 
According to the trade unionists, the pertinent contract for 
the overhaul, worth 530 million Slovak korunas (Sk), has already 
been signed with a Swiss firm and every month that the start of 
the general overhaul is delayed costs the company Sk12 million 
in financial penalties. (Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak 
11 May 94 p 2) An extraordinary meeting of the primary trade 
union organization at Skloobal Nemsova on 17 May decided to 
extend the strike alert until 7 June. It reserved the right to 
resort to "extreme means of pressure within the framework of the 
law" if the problem of financing the general overhaul and 
modernization of one of the melting facilities is not resolved 
by then. (Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak 18 May 94 p 3) 
  SLOVENSKA BANKA ENDED: An extraordinary meeting of the 
Slovenska Banka a.s. (Slovak Bank shareholding company), held at 
Banska Bystrica on 12 May, decided to abolish the company, after 
the Slovak National Bank (NBS) Banking Council refused to issue 
SLOVENSKA Banka a banking license. The National Property Fund 
(FNM) as the sole shareholder in Slovenska Banka also recalled 
the company's five-member board of directors and its seven- 
member supervisory board. At the same time, it decided to set 
up the Carpatia Consulta a.s., the aim of which is to prepare by 
12 October the founding of Banka Carpatia (Carpathia Bank). 
(Bratislava SME in Slovak 13 May 94 p 1) According to FNM 
representatives, the decision to abandon the Slovenska Banka 
project was influenced by the inability of the bank's steering 
bodies to comply with the demand of the NBS Banking Council that 
private capital have a majority stake in all newly established 
banks. The FNM's stake in Banka Carpathia should be only Sk196 
million (34 million), with the city of Banska Bystrica 
contributing Sk77 million (13 percent), and private shareholders 
the remaining Sk304 million. Banka Carpathia's head office will 
be in the "Gastrocentrum" building in Banska Bystrica; the value 
of the building represents the contribution of the city of 
Banska Bystrica to the bank's founding capital. (Bratislava 
PRAVDA in Slovak 14 May 94 p 2) O. Varga, chairman of the 
recalled supervisory board of Slovenska Banka a.s., called the 
FNM's course of action "politically motivated" and expressed 
doubts as to whether the required private capital would be found 
to set up Banka Carpathia by the planned deadline. (Bratislava 
NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 13 May 94 p 2) 
  JOINT BRICK FACTORY: The most modern brickyard in Slovakia 
opened at Zlate Moravce on 13 May, in the presence of Deputy 
Prime Minister Ivan Simko, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus, and 
the Austrian ambassador to Slovakia. Wienerberger Slovenske 
Tehelne (Wienerberger Slovak Brickyard) Ltd., which is fully 
automated, was built at a cost of Sk650 million and will employ 
45 people. Partners in this joint Austrian-Slovak venture are 
the Austrian Wienerberger Ziegelindustrie AG (65 percent), the 
Hydrostav a.s. (34 percent), and the city of Zlate Moravce (1 
percent). The brickyard's annual production capacity is 80 
million bricks. (Bratislava SMENA in Slovak 14 May 94 p 2; 
Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak 14 May 94 p 2) 
  SPA PRIVATIZATION: Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik received 
representatives of the Union of Slovak Spas on 13 May to discuss 
with them their proposal for the privatization of spa resorts. 
Privatization Minister Milan Janicina said after the meeting 
that the National Property Fund will not own more than 20 
percent of the spas' shares, so as not to obstruct the influx of 
foreign capital. He also agreed with the union's proposal that 
at least 10 percent of the spas' shares be transferred free of 
charge to the relevant communities. Only in the case of the 
Piestany spa, which represents a "special category," will the 
ministry propose that the free shares for the community be 
restricted to five percent. (Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in 
Slovak 14 May 94 p 2) 
  COUPON BOOKS: The Slovak Government approved on 14 May the 
draft decree on the issue of investment coupons. Under the 
decree, the price of the coupon book for the second wave of 
coupon privatization will be differentiated -- Sk700 for 
citizens born in 1934 or earlier and Sk1,000 for all other 
citizens. (Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak 16 May 94 p 1) 
  CERTIFICATES RAISE PRICES: In an interview for the 
Bratislava daily SME, representatives of several Slovak food 
importing companies contested Agriculture Minister Koncos' 
assertion that the requirement for quality certificates for 
imported food, introduced on 1 May, would have no influence on 
food prices. E. Vyrostko, representative of the ANAT company 
from Presov, admitted that his company, which imports food and 
vegetables, raised its prices because it must pay 
Sk2,000-Sk2,500 for each certificate (a certificate is required 
for each sample of imported goods). J. Topor, owner of the 
Ovocentrum company from Kosice, said that his firm now includes 
not only the cost of certificates in its prices, but also the 
cost of trips to Bratislava where the certificates are issued. 
Topor also complained that, before the certificates are issued, 
the tested fruit and vegetable samples are "rendered worthless." 
(Bratislava SME in Slovak 16 may 94 p 2) 
  OBSTRUCT FOOD IMPORTS: Another article in SME noted that 
custom officers' demand for quality certificates for imported 
food was becoming a "nightmare" for many importers. According 
to the article, Slovak authorities require that food importers 
furnish a confirmation that the producer of the imported goods 
is well known to the state bodies of his country. "It is 
difficult to go and meet a producer in Turkey or Malaysia and 
convince him that Slovak authorities want to see his production 
license. If the producer does not have such a document, should 
I find an independent state body in the relevant country and 
ask, for instance, a Spanish authority to issue a document for a 
Spanish producer? I would also have to find and pay an 
interpreter. And what about a case when six Slovak importers 
want to import goods produced by a single firm," SME quotes a 
Slovak businessmen who "preferred not to order any goods in the 
past four weeks" as saying. Another businessman, who imports 
chocolate from a distributor with exclusive rights for the whole 
Eastern Europe, told SME: "I cannot imagine how I will explain 
to him that he must obtain a certificate for me." According to 
the daily, most entrepreneurs intend to include the costs of 
hunting for certificates at home and abroad and the cost of 
translations in their prices. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 21 May 
94 p 1) 
  FIRST QUARTER TRADE: The Slovak Republic imported goods 
worth Sk47.3 billion and exported goods worth Sk43.6 billion in 
the first three months of the year, according to Slovak 
Statistical Office data. The balance of trade deficit amounted 
to Sk3.743 billion. The most important export markets in the 
first quarter of the year were the Czech Republic, the 
destination of 37.9 percent of all Slovak exports, followed by 
Hungary (5.5 percent), and Russia (3.6 percent). Most Slovak 
imports came from the Czech Republic (30.2 percent), Russia (22 
percent), and the FRG (11.3 percent). Compared with the first 
three months of 1993, Slovakia managed to increase its exports 
especially to Italy (by 73.4 percent), the FRG (47.8 percent), 
and Hungary (40.3 percent). Imports increased, particularly from 
the United States (198.3 percent) and France (174.9 percent). 
(Bratislava SME in Slovak 17 May 94 p 2) 
  FOREIGN INVESTMENT: Foreign capital invested in firms in 
Slovakia reached the sum of Sk11.5 billion ($388 million) by the 
end of the first quarter of the year, which was Sk723 million 
(6.7 percent) more than at the end of 1993. The number of 
Slovak firms with a foreign ownership stake reached 5,719 at the 
end of March 1994, 358 more than at the end of December 1993, 
with most foreign capital going into firms in Bratislava (54.4 
percent), Poprad district (7.8 percent), and Humenne district 
(7.1 percent). In the first quarter of the year, 35 
organizations with foreign capital participation ceased to exist 
(compared with 49 in 1993 as a whole) and another 80 
organizations (65 in 1993) are "in liquidation." In 77.7 percent 
of all organizations with foreign capital involvement, the 
foreign partner's stake does not exceed Sk100,000 and in only 
1.5 percent of these organizations does it exceed the sum of 
Sk10 million. Austria continues to top the ranking of foreign 
investors, accounting for 23.4 percent of all foreign 
investments in Slovakia. It is followed by Germany (21 
percent), the Czech Republic (13 percent), and the United States 
(12 percent). (Bratislava SME in Slovak 17 May 94 p 2; 
Bratislava PRAVDA FINANCNE SPRAVODAJSTVO Supplement 18 May 94 p 
4) 
  BRATISLAVA REALTY VALUE: The results of stock-taking of the 
value of real assets owned by the city of Bratislava show that 
13.3 percent of the city's area is owned by the community. The 
city owns almost 4,900 hectares of land worth more than Sk73 
billion (based on an average price of Sk1,500 per square meter) 
and more than 4,400 buildings worth Sk16.5 billion. Apart from 
this, the city has a stake in the Istrobanka. The overall value 
of property owned by the city thus represents more than Sk90 
billion. (Bratislava SME in Slovak 17 May 94 p 2) 
  BELOW SUBSISTENCE LEVEL: According to the results of a 
"microcensus" commissioned by the Ministry of Labor, Social 
Affairs, and the Family, 9.5 percent of households (76 percent 
of which were families with children) had in 1993 an income 
below the subsistence minimum (which averages Sk1,600 a month 
per household member). Another 42 percent of households had 
income in the range of 1 to 1.5 times the subsistence minimum 
and only 15 percent of households an income higher than twice 
the subsistence minimum. The survey also revealed that the 
number of families that identify themselves as "poor" increased 
from 10.7 percent in 1992 to 13.4 percent in 1993. (Bratislava 
SME in Slovak 17 May 94 p 3) 
  LABOR DISPUTE SETTLED: The labor dispute in the Euroobuv 
footwear factory in Komarno ended in an agreement between the 
employer and representatives of employees on 17 May. Under the 
terms of the agreement, all 500 Euroobuv employees are to return 
to work on 18 May after a week-long strike. The management 
undertook to withdraw all notices given for "breach of labor 
discipline," to raise base pay 10 percent (instead of the 40 
percent demanded by the strikers), and to peg any additional 
wage increases to performance. The representatives of employees 
pledged to make up for all missed shifts (five working days) by 
the end of June, by coming to work on Saturdays. (Bratislava 
PRAVDA in Slovak 18 May 94 p 2) 
  BUDGET DEFICIT DECLINE: The state budget deficit declined 
from Sk6 billion at the end of March 1994 to Sk3.86 billion at 
the end of April 1994. Budget revenues amounted to Sk13.4 
billion in April, which was Sk3 billion more than projected.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by Antoine de Gerondo; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Gyula Horn, leader of the (former Communist) 
Socialist Party which won last Sunday's parliamentary elections, 
should logically become the next Hungarian Government chief. He 
will then have many reasons to savor his victory. First, 
because shortly before the first round of the elections this 
62-year-old man miraculously survived a car accident, which has 
left him wearing a metal surgical collar. Second, because he 
has overcome the accusations about his controversial past when, 
as a young Communist, he formed part of the militia responsible 
for crushing the 1956 uprising. Indeed, for most Hungarians, 
this former Communist is still primarily a reformer who 
contributed to the collapse of the Soviet bloc by enabling East 
German refugees to reach the West via Hungary in 1989. 
  [De Gerondo] How can your past as party leader be reconciled 
with your recent conversion to supporting free trade and the 
market economy? Will you continue the previous government's 
policy? 
  [Horn] I find it difficult to understand how my past as a 
party man can interfere with my conversion to a supporter of a 
free market economy. On Sunday, in the parliamentary elections, 
the Hungarians overwhelmingly rejected the previous government. 
Logically, I find it difficult to see why I should continue that 
government's line. But, to the extent that your question 
relates to the Hungarian Socialist Party's intention of setting 
up a market economy, I say firmly that this is our intention. 
  [De Gerondo] If you become prime minister, what will you do 
to draw a distinction between your role as party leader and that 
of government chief? In particular, will you be able to 
counterbalance the influence of the MSZOSZ (the powerful trade 
union federation led by Sandor Nagy), the legacy of the past and 
the basis of your electorate? 
  [Horn] The functions of government chief and party leader 
are not incompatible. Moreover, there are many examples in 
Western Europe. I personally await the decision of the 
forthcoming Socialist Party congress. As regards the second 
part of your question, we have still not analyzed in detail the 
fundamental structures of our voters or their sympathies. My 
intention is to entrust this task to an opinion poll institute. 
Today, nobody in Hungary can answer this question. Everybody 
has the right to express his own views. However, I must add 
that I am well enough known for people to realize that I make my 
decisions alone. 
  [De Gerondo] Will you continue the current privatization 
policy? In particular the return of land to its former owners 
and the payment of compensation? 
  [Horn] We will not continue the privatizations in the same 
way. Compared with the policy pursued by the former government 
coalition, we want to prevent corruption. Privatization 
operations will be open and subject to the sovereignty of the 
deputies. The goal will be to protect jobs, and even to create 
them, and not to deliver Hungary to uncontrolled commercialism. 
To answer the second part of your question, it is natural that 
the legal provisions on compensation, which have already been 
adopted, should be respected and that compensation should be 
carried through without restrictions. 
<H5>  Respect for the Opposition </H5>
  [De Gerondo] Following your victory on Sunday, will you take 
account of the opposition's proposals if they serve the 
country's interests? 
  [Horn] Even in the past, I have always taken account of 
proposals or even ideas from other groups. Without 
discrimination. I will not depart from that line of conduct now. 
  [De Gerondo] Hungary needs Western aid to rebuild its 
economy. Will you continue the policy of cooperation with the 
Western countries set up over the past four years, or will you 
adopt a different course? In particular, will you have 
different relations with the countries of the former Socialist 
bloc and with the countries which have emerged from the former 
USSR? 
  [Horn] Hungary does not need Western aid to rebuild its 
economy. To modernize its infrastructure, this country must 
follow one political line: maintaining market relations with 
all the countries which have a mutual interest. The Hungarian 
Socialist Party's position is known: We will not question the 
bases of our foreign policy which is the result of a general 
consensus among the six parties represented in parliament. 
However, we cannot deny that the previous government made 
mistakes in relations with the East European countries. 
Geopolitically, and also because of historical circumstances, 
it is logical that we should give more weight to our relations 
with Eastern Europe. 
  [De Gerondo] Will you give new impetus to the process of 
integrating Hungary in the European Union and NATO? 
  [Horn] That would be a kind of "unrequited love." The 
integration process is now functioning by itself as a series of 
provisions which have been discussed and drawn up and which 
contain preconditions. In this respect, it is rather unlikely 
that a change of government will make big differences to the 
process started. 
  [De Gerondo] You are also known as the Socialist monarch. 
You were a reformist Communist in the past, and now you are a 
Socialist. Are you really a democrat? 
  [Horn] Over the past four years and especially in recent 
weeks, I have been given many titles. I have not heard the one 
you mention, or at least I do not remember it. I think that 
over the past few years, the Hungarian Socialist Party has 
asserted itself as a truly democratic movement, as a force of 
the Left which defends the interests of the majority of society. 
I am president of this party. But you probably know this 
comment by Heinrich Boell: "Any honest man has been a Communist 
at least once in his life."

  [Excerpt] A Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] coalition with 
the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] at any rate, but not at 
any price; this was said by Gyula Horn at the 31 May session of 
the council of Budapest branches of the MSZP. Journalists were 
briefed today on what happened at the session. Edit Schranz 
reports. 
  [Schranz] Party Chairman Gyula Horn spoke of a determination 
to form a coalition, according to Lajos Matyas Szabo, chairman 
of the council, who described yesterday's session of the 
Budapest branches of the MSZP. Szabo said a stable coalition is 
an important factor in the party's legitimacy in the eyes of 
society. This is what Lajos Matyas Szabo said: 
  [Begin Szabo recording] We view the coming period as one of 
modest and expert service, and, as the principal guarantee for 
all this, a coalition with the SZDSZ -- at any rate but not at 
any price. In other words, on the basis of programs already 
coordinated. [end recording] 
  [Schranz] Szabo also said that last night's session did not 
discuss the question of whom to recommend as prime minister, 
because this has first to be debated by the 25 branches in 
Budapest. 
  The proposals for the post of prime minister will be 
assessed 
by the MSZP on Thursday, the party's position will be formed by 
Friday, and this will be submitted to the MSZP Congress on 
Saturday, Lajos Matyas Szabo explained. 
  By the way, it is Chairman Szabo's view that since the MSZP 
has 63 percent of the Budapest seats in the National Assembly, 
this will allow it to direct the country onto a 
socialist-liberal path. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Studio interview and phone-in question-and-answer session </F>
with Laszo Kovacs, chief foreign affairs expert of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party, by unidentified announcer -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] Welcome to Laszlo Kovacs, foreign 
affairs expert of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The 
foreign affairs policy of the MSZP--which has been elected to 
government--and the party's relations with Hungarians living 
beyond our border are on our agenda here. [passage omitted] Do 
you consider a wide-ranging regional autonomy justified where 
the composition of population is suitable for this, for example 
in Szeklerland? [passage omitted] 
  [Kovacs] I think that the demand for autonomy is a justified 
endeavor of the Hungarians beyond the border wherever they live 
in large numbers on a certain territory. Furthermore, 
Szeklerland is in a special situation; it is rather far away 
from the Hungarian border, so the idea of fulfilling the demand 
for autonomy would, by any chance, lead to the upsetting of 
borders. This is certainly an important and, at the same time, 
sensitive issue, which can only be approached and put on the 
talks agenda if the sides concerned approach it with good 
intentions. This is why we consider it so important that Hungary 
and its neighbors should have basically good relations, because 
these issues cannot even be put on the agenda without it. 
  [Announcer] Yes, Gyula Horn has several times mentioned that 
there is a need for a historical reconciliation with our 
neighbors. What does this mean exactly? 
  [Kovacs] We mean that we have to settle our relations, first 
of all with Slovakia and Romania, which have become very tense 
over the past years. We have never said....[pauses] We even 
emphasized that this was not exclusively the Hungarian 
Government's fault. What we said was that the Hungarian 
Government was not able to handle the tensions, which had 
occurred for objective reasons, for example, because of the 
nationalistic endeavors in neighboring countries and, on the 
other hand, the Hungarian Government itself contributed to this 
tension with some clumsy statements and unfortunate steps. 
  Well, we are of the view that the settlement of these 
relations is inevitable for several reasons. On the one hand, 
it is obvious that relations with our neighbors constitute a 
security policy issue for Hungary; on the other hand, 
Hungary--and any country in general--cannot exist without 
pursuing extensive economic-commercial cooperation with its 
neighbors. The third specific question is that the life of 
Hungarians living in neighboring countries cannot improve if we 
forego, from the outset, the means provided by settled relations 
and dialogue. 
  Where else could we raise these problems? I do not believe 
that any kind of pressure can be put on our neighbors with 
canceled visits--or even with visits that have not taken place. 
The experience of the past four years has not proved the 
usefulness or productivity of this approach. Hungary does not 
have such influence that any kind of effect could be achieved in 
this way. With certain exaggeration I can even say that Hungary 
cannot put pressure on Romania with success because Romania is 
twice as big as Hungary, and we cannot put pressure on Slovakia 
because Slovakia is half as big as Hungary and, therefore, twice 
as sensitive. Exercising pressure must be excluded from our 
means. 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] What kind of guarantees does 
the MSZP see that Romanians will observe their minimal promises 
to the Hungarian minority, since they have never kept their 
promises in 70 years? 
  [Kovacs] I think that it is an absurdity to sit down at the 
international negotiations table with the assumption that my 
partner is lying or that my partner has never kept his promises. 
This is an absurdity. In this case there is no point in 
sitting down, there is no sense in negotiations. [passage 
omitted] I see only one guarantee. There is a need for an 
international--bilateral--agreement, the frequently mentioned 
Basic Treaty, which includes real elements of guarantee, in 
respect of which the sides can be called to account. I have 
also hopes for the initiative called the Balladur plan, the 
opening conference for which took place in Paris just last week. 
  [Announcer] Does the MSZP--and you personally--think that 
the so-called Ukrainian clause could be included in these basic 
treaties? 
  [Kovacs] I think, yes. However, I have to add.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Both in the Hungarian-Romanian and 
the Hungarian-Slovak Basic Treaties? 
  [Kovacs] I think, basically yes. However, those who say 
this, that this Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty cannot set a 
precedent, are also right. A Hungarian-Ukrainian Basic Treaty 
cannot set a precedent for a Hungarian-Slovak or a 
Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty on a one-to-one basis. 
  However, I regard it as a mistake that, at the time some 
government politicians categorically said that a basic treaty of 
this kind will not be concluded any more. What kind of basic 
treaties will we then conclude? Naturally, the 
Hungarian-Ukrainian, the Hungarian-Romanian, and the 
Hungarian-Slovak basic treaties will not literally match. 
However, I think that the content of the future basic treaties 
will be similar to the Hungarian-Ukrainian one. 
  It will not be possible to evade two questions in them: One 
of them is the repeated confirmation of the borders, the 
renouncing of territorial claims; our neighbors insist on it and 
we have no reasons for evading them, because we really do not 
have territorial claims, because we really do accept the current 
borders. This is not an argument because we have confirmed it 
hundreds of times. Since we have accepted it hundreds of times, 
there is no reason why we should not do it another time. 
  Another question that cannot be evaded is guaranteeing the 
rights of the Hungarian minority living there and--let me add, 
since it is a bilateral matter--the minorities living here. 
[passage omitted] 
  Our political rivals often accuse us of intending to 
conclude 
unilateral basic treaties. [passage omitted] We have never said 
that. We have always stressed that the border issue and the 
minority issue cannot be evaded either in the basic treaties. 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] Will the future Hungarian 
Government undertake the representation of Hungarians beyond the 
border if they cannot represent themselves--as it happened at 
the opening conference--in the European stability process. 
  [Kovacs] [passage omitted] Agreements on minorities in this 
matter, with which the minorities themselves do not agree, 
cannot be concluded. This is obviously absurd. Therefore, some 
kind of solution has to be found so that the minorities can 
present their endeavors and interests. [passage omitted] 
Hungarian foreign policy, in my view, should not be considering 
whether to undertake or not the representation of the 
minorities, but far more than that: the question of how to 
convince the sides concerned in the conference that the 
minorities have to have their say. A solution has to be found 
for this. 
  [Announcer] [passage omitted] What are the MSZP's plans with 
Duna Television? Will the MSZP support it with grants from the 
budget? 
  [Kovacs] [passage omitted] If Duna Television really 
usefully 
contributes to the cause of normal relations between Hungary and 
its neighbors and--by this, together with this, parallel with 
this--the cause of Hungarians beyond the border, I think that 
Duna Television will be worthy of support. [passage omitted] 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much for the answers from Laszlo 
Kovacs, about whom it is being said in Budapest that he is a 
possible candidate for the post of foreign minister. 
  [Kovacs] I think that it will be decided by the coalition 
talks, with particular regard to the question of which of the 
possible coalition partners will get the foreign affairs 
portfolio.... 
  [Announcer interrupting] But if it is offered? 
  [Kovacs] Naturally, this is such a professional 
challenge--it 
will be the peak of my foreign affairs career--that I would say 
yes, but at the moment we are not talking about it. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [Editorial by Andras Bencsik: "Balkan Dreams"] </F>
  [Text] One can interpret the recent elections in many 
ways. The first lesson, however, is that Hungary has returned to 
the line of former socialist countries after a detour of four 
years. Like almost everywhere, the victorious left also 
returned to power in Hungary. For the Hungarian voters, the 
Balkan way seems to be more feasible than the European way; 
however, this does not mean the end of democracy; it only means 
a different model. 
  We can draw at least a similar lesson from the fact that the 
Socialists' triumph is accompanied by the fall of all the former 
opposition parties. Members of the government coalition have 
been automatically replaced and, within the coalition, the 
collapse of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] became tragic 
at the election finish. The former rallying party with 42 
percent of the votes has become a dwarf party with 9.5 percent. 
However, the collapse of the other opposition parties is even 
more spectacular than the tragic defeat of the MDF. The 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which seemed to be heading 
for triumph at the end of the first round, suffered the 
third-biggest loss after the losses of the MDF and the 
Smallholders Party by the end of the second round and compared 
with the 1990 elections. This is a surprising development, and 
it is even more surprising that the liberals were unable to get 
a single individual candidate in parliament in Budapest 
decorated with the party's flags. 
  I think it is not an exaggeration to say that, indirectly, 
the two rival parties -- the SZDSZ and the MDF -- did the most 
for the success of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. And 
this really gives food for thought. Just like [SZDSZ Chairman] 
Ivan Peto's sudden fit of the blues. The chairman of the party 
that was running its superstar candidate for the position of 
prime minister is now desperately trying to prove that they have 
not yet made any clear statements regarding the coalition, and 
he is trying to make people understand that the liberals do not 
find it at all attractive to join the government. 
  I believe that it is no longer attractive for them today. 
Gabor Kuncze's glory is over. Not only that he will not become 
prime minister, but it is hardly questionable whether he could 
get a ministry from the few the Socialists might offer to them 
in a possible government coalition. However, the issue is more 
complex than that. If the SZDSZ decides to remain in 
opposition, they will get into a rather special situation, 
because remaining in opposition at the cost of shrinking the 
party will hardly seem a noble feat of arms to the party 
membership divided over the idea of a left-wing coalition. 
  In addition, in the opposition, the SZDSZ will enter 
political quarantine. Viktor Orban [chairman of the Federation 
of Young Democrats, Fidesz] already said it clearly that the 
liberal coalition has ceased to exist. And the relations 
between the former coalition parties and the SZDSZ are at least 
that clear. 
  In the opposition, the SZDSZ can become unpleasantly 
isolated 
and this can lead to the disintegration of the party elite. If 
it gets into the government, the SZDSZ will become weightless 
and will also lose a considerable number of influential members 
and supporters who reject the leftist government. 
  The coalition will not be an easy one, and the Socialists 
are 
also aware of this. They now regard both liberal parties as 
natural partners, and this formulation also contains a message 
to the Fidesz. The Fidesz will also find it difficult to 
decide, because this party collapsed into the smallest party, 
but they preserved their moral reserves, something that can also 
be reduced to nil in a few months at the side of the Socialist 
Party with an absolute majority in Parliament. 
  Logic would dictate today that the Socialists should form a 
government alone, but logic is asserted in politics in a rather 
complex way. The MDF, which caused a landslide with its tragic 
politics, might cleanse itself and strengthen in the opposition, 
if it is able to acknowledge its defeat. Although the SZDSZ, 
which made complete use of the MDF mistakes, could make their 
dreams of power true, they could only do that at a price that 
could lead to a total disintegration of the party, because a big 
social-democratic party could also be the end of an MSZP-SZDSZ 
coalition. A possible liberal-conservative opposition coalition 
would completely close the door to the SZDSZ that joined the 
government. However, if the SZDSZ gives up its dream of power, 
they will have to admit that they also followed a tragic 
strategy. And they will not have the cathartic and protecting 
force of the experience of government activity behind them. 
  Today, the SZDSZ has to choose between two bad things. Both 
bad things can considerably reduce the party's weight, power, 
and credibility. If they win, they will lose. If they join the 
loser, they might win. Perhaps in a later round. Whichever 
solution they choose, their decision will lead to the emergence 
of a new SZDSZ. Paradoxically, the tragedy of the SZDSZ is 
identical with that of the MDF. However, the MDF has it easier, 
because it no longer has a choice: If it fails to renew itself, 
it will cease to exist. However, its political counterpoint does 
not yet know which possibility of renewal to choose: To 
assimilate or to again deny itself.

<F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova from the Bulgarian Socialist </F>
Party Congress in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] The first thing the delegates to the 41st Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] Congress did was to adopt the congress 
agenda. Two additions to the agenda were proposed and adopted. 
The first proposes that a debate should be held on the party's 
election campaign platform during the discussions on the BSP 
program, and the second is to hear a declaration from a group of 
BSP intellectuals on the situation of the Bulgarian 
intelligentsia and the BSP's stance on this issue. 
  BSP Supreme Council leader Zhan Videnov read to the 
delegates 
an exceptionally detailed report entitled "On the BSP political 
line." Here are a few of the points he mentioned: 
  According to Videnov, the SDS's policy regarding the 
government failed because it was based on confrontation and 
restoration of the former state of things. This has led to the 
SDS becoming isolated form the people and falling into a serious 
crisis, Videnov said. 
  Despite the numerous question marks hanging over the formula 
on which the Berov cabinet was formed 18 months ago, the BSP 
supported Berov because he placed all-national interests higher 
than narrow party ones. However, Videnov stressed that a number 
of features now militate against this support: the blocking of 
the reforms, complete exhaustion of resources, and a fragile 
economy. The most crucial decision that you congress delegates 
have to reach, Videnov said, is to call for early elections in 
October or November, which can lead to major changes in the 
country's development and the imposition of a clear, 
left-of-center, socially oriented policy. However, he emphasized 
that Bulgaria needs early elections, but they should in no event 
be premature ones. For the BSP, the elections were not an aim 
in itself, but means for developing a free and just society. 
The road toward such a society lies precisely via democratic 
elections, the BSP leader emphasized. 
  Here is one of the concluding sentences that Videnov said at 
the end of this speech: More than ever before, we must get to 
realize where and why we went wrong during these four or five 
years that followed 45 years, and then strive to unleash new 
potential for social dialogue. 
  At the moment the congress is continuing with a report from 
the All-Party Control-Auditing Commission, and it is then to 
hear a report on the work of the BSP parliamentary group.

  [Text] At the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
Congress, which opened today, party leader Zhan Videnov read a 
report on the party's political line. Sasha Karakaksheva, 
chairperson of the BSP All-Party Control Commission, reported on 
this commission's activity. Nora Ananieva, chairperson of the 
BSP parliamentary faction, reported on the faction's activity. 
  A news conference took place after the end of the first 
session. Zhan Videnov told the news conference that the 
Socialists expect to receive more than 40 percent of the votes 
at the next elections, but they have no intention of usurping 
power. The BSP categorically denies that it was the perpetrator 
of criminal rule, Videnov said. Nora Ananieva said that the BSP 
parliamentary faction will implement the congress decisions, but 
it will act in a flexible manner. A debate on Zhan Videnov's 
report on the party's political line has opened.

  [Text] The negotiations on a cease-fire in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be held at the French mission in Geneva 
on Saturday and Sunday [4 and 5 June]. This was stated for SRNA

Serbian Republic [of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. As he said, he 
received this piece of information from Nikiforov, the Russian 
member of the contact group for the former Yugoslavia. 
  Yasushi Akashi, special UN envoy for the former Yugoslavia, 
who held talks with the delegation of the Serbian Republic, is 
trying to persuade all the warring sides to take part in the 
continuation of the peace talks, Momcilo Krajisnik said. He 
stressed that the Muslim delegation is abusing the problem of 
Gorazde for the umpteenth time in order to obstruct peace in the 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The representatives of the Serbian Republic should hold 
informal talks in Geneva with Charles Redman, U.S. envoy for the 
former Yugoslavia.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, June 3 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces 
remained within an UN-ordered exclusion zone around Gorazde 
Friday, blocking the resumption of truce talks here, the 
commander of UN forces in former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand de 
Lapresle, said. There were still "barely a few dozen in three 
pockets in the exclusion zone," he said. 
  UN officials have called for a meeting here with Bosnian 
Serb 
leader Radovan Karadzic to discuss the presence of around 150 
Serb forces in Gorazde. The Bosnian Government has demanded 
their complete withdrawal in compliance with an April 22 
ultimatum as a condition for their attending the talks, called 
to arrange an overall ceasefire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Late Thursday a UN military spokesman said the Serbs had made 
no move to withdraw from the exclusion zone, contradicting an 
announcement by UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi that they had 
begun their pullout. 
  "There is no evidence at all that the Serbs are 
withdrawing," 
UN Protection Force spokesman Dacre Holloway said in Sarajevo. 
"Our information is that the situation is exactly the same," he 
said, charging that the armed Serb forces had merely donned 
civilian clothes and were pretending to be refugees while 
continuing to carry guns. 
  Negotiations due to have opened Thursday were postponed when 
it became clear that despite pledges from Karadzic that they 
would retreat the Bosnian Serb units had remained in place. 
Akashi on Thursday evening said the Serb forces had launched 
their withdrawal. "I have received positive news," he told AFP. 
"They have started their evacuation, but there are still some 
places where they have not moved." 
  Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams, later added that about 
100 policemen had left the exclusion zone before nightfall. The 
reports were flatly contradicted by Major Holloway in Sarajevo. 
"The police and militia are wearing civilian clothes," he said. 
"But they are still carrying guns. They took their police 
uniforms off and claim to be refugees."

<F P=106> [Report by Fahrudin Bekcic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpt] Instead of withdrawing from the 3-km zone, as 
the UN Security Council Resolution No. 913 and the NATO 
ultimatum dictate, the chetniks around Gorazde have been 
changing their uniforms. First they were soldiers, then the 
civilian police, and now they are armed civilians. In the next 
stage one can expect that they will strip to the waist. 
  On 3 June at 1100 they occupied the same positions they have 
occupied for the last 40 days. The issue of the right bank is 
obscuring the fact that the chetniks have not withdrawn from the 
3-km zone on the left bank either. Thus, there is still a 
chetnik stronghold in Sjenokos which is 2.5 km from the town 
center. Last night and this morning frequent infantry 
provocations were exhibited from these positions. The defense 
lines in the northwest of the battlefield, on the free territory 
of Rogatica Commune, have been attacked by artillery since 
yesterday afternoon. It is the Muslim part of the village of 
(?Vrazovice) that has been targeted. Needless to say, the 
projectiles have been fired from within the 20-km exclusion 
zone. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, June 3 (TANJUG) -- The spokesman of the 
special U.N. envoy Yasushi Akashi, Micheal Williams, said Friday 
[3 June], quoting a telephone conversation with Gorazde, that 
the withdrawal of the Serb forces from the three kilometer 
exclusion zone around Gorazde, eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, had 
started but that it was still not satisfactory. Williams told a 
press conference that cease-fire talks would not go ahead until 
the last element of the Serb militia, army and the last armed 
civilian of Serb nationality leaves the three-kilometer 
exclusion zone around Gorazde. He also said that the latest 
situation in the region was presently being discussed by 
UNPROFOR commanders for former Yugoslavia General Bertrand de 
Lapresle and for Bosnia-Herzegovina General Michael Rose with 
the officials of the Bosnian Serb Republic President Radovan 
Karadzic and bosnian Army Commander Ratko Mladic. 
  Williams told the press that two formations of Canadian blue 
helmets were dispatched from Sarajevo to Gorazde Friday morning 
as reinforcements to ensure that the demands for the Serbs 
withdrawal from the three-kilometer diameter are being complied 
with. According to Williams, the premier of the Muslim-Croat 
federation and head of the Muslim delegation Haris Silajdzic was 
currently in Paris. He did not specify if he was there for 
consultations. The vice-president of the Muslim-Croat 
federation Ejup Ganic, and the delegation accompanying him, is 
on his way to Zagreb and is due to reach Geneva Friday evening. 
  The Muslim delegation conditions its participation in the 
cease-fire talks with the withdrawal of the Serb forces from 
around Gorazde. If the Serbs withdraw Akashi could reschedule 
the cease-fire talks for Friday evening or Saturday morning, 
Williams said. If the cease-fire talks start on Saturday, the 
meeting of the contact group on the territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between the warring Muslims, Serbs and 
Croats, scheduled for Saturday, will be postponed by 24 hours. 
  The meeting of the contact group with the Bosnian warring 
sides was initially scheduled for June 6 and 7 in Talloires, 
France, but the French Foreign Ministry Thursday postponed the 
meeting to June 4 and 5 in the French Embassy in Geneva. It 
could now be further postponed by another 24 hours.

  [Text] After a long period of truce, the Serbs launched 
another artillery attacks on Mostar. Ankica Posavljak has a 
report: 
  [Posavljak] The information center of Mostar reports that a 
general alert was sounded at 1259 in the town. We were informed 
by the Information and Political Service of the Croatian Defense 
Council for the Mostar operational area that 10 tank shells were 
fired from Serbian positions located at the foot of Mt. Velez. 
The Mostar suburbs of Cim, Orlovac, Ilici, and Zovnica in the 
western part of Mostar, which are under Croatian Defense Council 
control, were targeted. 
  A base of the Spanish UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
battalion in Mostar was also hit and several vehicles were 
damaged. There have been no reports of casualties, but 
considerable material damage has been caused.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 2 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs shelled a 
British UN base in central Bosnia-Herzegovina Wednesday [1 June] 
but stopped their attack after NATO planes swooped down, a UN 
military spokesman said Thursday [2 June]. The "close air 
support" was called in by the local UN commander, said Major Rob 
Annink for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). He said the 
Serbs fired seven rounds within five minutes Wednesday afternoon 
near the UN British base in the central town of Bugojno. One of 
the shells came down inside the base but caused only material 
damage. 
  The Serbs fired six more shells and two rockets into the 
town 
Wednesday evening after the UNPROFOR command had sent a protest 
letter to the Bosnian Serb headquarters and evacuated all 
non-essential UN personnel -- 220 people -- to the town of 
Gornji Vakuf, 15 kilometers (nine miles) away. 
  The UN commander in Bugojno requested close air support from 
the UNPROFOR commander for ex-Yugoslavia General Bertrand de 
Lapresle and special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi, Annink said. He 
said De Lapresle and Akashi authorized the flights at 8:50 P.M. 
(1850 GMT), while the Serb attacks were still under way. 
Shortly before that, UNPROFOR Chief-of-Staff in Bosnia General 
Adrian Van Baal called his Serb counterpart, General Manojlo 
Milovanovic, "discussing with him the possibility of close air 
support," Annink said. The UN planes were in the air over 
Bugojno and saw the tanks but did not use force because "they 
were not sure these were the tanks that were firing into the 
town," the spokesman said. But the attacks stopped a short time 
later, with Milovanovic confirming the shelling was over in a 
second telehphone call to Van Baal. 
  It was the second time in a week that the threat of close 
air 
support prompted an end to a Serb attack on UNPROFOR facilities. 
The other incident happened Tuesday [31 May] in the northern 
town of Tuzla, a UN safe area, when the local UN commander asked 
for close air support after Serbs shelled the Tuzla air base. 
The flights were not authorized in that case because the Serb 
shelling stopped after a phone conversation between Van Baal and 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic. Annink said the two 
incidents showed "that close air support is a good means of 
deterrence of attacks."

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Galic from Gracanica] </F>
  [Text] In the course of the night and early this morning 
the Chetniks have continued attacking in the zone of 
responsibility of the Gracanica Operative Group [words 
indistinct] 109th Doboj Brigade. The infantry attacks were 
accompanied by the shelling of our defense lines and suburban 
settlements (?Glokotici), (?Prisic), Lukavica, and 
(Lukavica-Rijeka). The chetniks were particularly active 
between 2000 and 2200 hours when over 200 projectiles of various 
calibers landed on our lines and the aforementioned civilian 
settlements. This was followed by a ferocious infantry attack. 
By resisting successfully this attack, our fighters have 
liquidated a great number of Chetniks, who were left between the 
lines and are still lying there, which says enough about the 
enemy's attitude toward their dead soldiers. 
  The late night saw a concentration of the Serbian forces and 
sporadic shelling. However, as of 0400 this morning the attacks 
have intensified. 
  The aim of these enemy attacks is to gain control over 
important elevations (?Pribevine), Oblic, and Banjic in order to 
widen the security ring around Doboj. As of 0900 a general 
alarm has been in force in Gracanica.

<F P=106> [Report by Vlado Trisic] </F>
  [Text] The information collected today by the Serbian 
intelligence circles in Bijeljina are the best proof of the fact 
that the joint state of the Muslims and Croats had been created 
with the clear aim of becoming a coalition bloc for countering 
the Serbs. According to these reliable military sources, there 
are nearly 50,000 soldiers in Tuzla at the moment, with new 
forces coming every day from the former Croat-Muslim front and 
from abroad. 
  It is known for sure, one is told in Bijeljina today, that 
Zagreb airport and the Split port are the main points for 
disembarking arms, military equipment, and volunteers from 
Muslim countries who are then, it is claimed, immediately sent 
to Tuzla, regardless of the complaints by Croats from some 
Croatian cantons. 
  According to what is said in the east Bosnian corps press 
center today, artillery pieces and ammunition has been 
disembarked from three ships in the Split port last week and 
seven NATO cargo aircraft landed on Zagreb airport. The 
disembarkation was closely followed by the regular Army of the 
Republic of Croatia and representatives of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Convoys that included UNPROFOR vehicles 
immediately set off toward Tuzla. 
  Apart from this sea port and airport, the Tuzla Dubrave 
airport has also been used for deliveries of military equipment 
recently, despite constant protests by the Serbian side that the 
airport should exclusively be used for humanitarian purposes and 
with Serbian representatives being present. However, all the 
demands made so far have simply been ignored by the 
international forces who are often using this facility for 
provocative purposes. 
  According to the announcement the east Bosnian corps of the 
army of the republic of Srpska issued today, all this that has 
recently been happening in the Tuzla region shows that peace is 
still far away in these territories and that the situation on 
the Majevica and Brcko battlefields has been nearing the boiling 
point.

  [Excerpt] Doboj, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- After several days of 
fighting on the Ozren-Vozuca front, the fiercest of which took 
place yesterday, forces of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army 
have been heavily defeated. Attacking from three directions in 
the Vosuca area, the Muslims attempted to take control of the 
Zavidovici-Banovici road, which passes through Vozuca, and in 
this way link the Zenica and Tuzla regions. Their attacks were 
repulsed by the defenders of Ozren and Vozuca, and the enemy 
suffered heavy losses. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Petrovac, June 3 (TANJUG) -- A member of the forces 
of the autonomous province of western Bosnia was killed Thursday 
[2 June] in attacks by forces loyal to Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic, local Muslim media reported. According to 
Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the capital of the province, 
the heaviest fighting was reported in the Liskovac region and 
the forces of the autonomous province tried to prevent 
Izetbegovic's forces from penetrating their defense lines. 
  The same source says that Izetbegovic forces continued with 
heavy shelling of Pecigrad. Muslims in the western part of the 
former republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina declared their autonomy 
last September standing up against the war-mongering policy of 
Izetbegovic and disassociating themselves from the decisions of 
the Muslim leadership in Sarajevo. 
  Since then, Western Bosnia-Herzegovina has been the scene of 
fierce intra-Muslim clashes, where Izetbegovic has sent his 
troops against his countrymen instructing them to stifle the new 
autonomy `with all available means'.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, June 3 (TANJUG) -- The first appearance on 
the international scene of the Muslim-Croat federation in the 
former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina has proved it to 
be a dead letter. After the Geneva conference was put off on 
Thursday, even those world analysts who are in favour of the 
federation, now admit that it is only a temporary political 
alliance with the two sides differing in all interests but one 
-- to fight the Bosnian Serbs. The Geneva peace conference, 
scheduled by special U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi, was cancelled because it was attended only by the 
delegations of the Bosnian Serbs, headed by their president 
Radovan Karadzic, and the Bosnian Croats, headed by the 
president of the Muslim-Croat Federation Kresimir Zubak. 
  The Bosnian Muslim delegation, headed by Prime Minister 
Haris 
Silajdzic, failed to appear. This has raised the question of 
who can the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation be represented by if 
not by its own president. It is apparently being represented, 
both in Bosnia-Herzegovina and abroad, by each of its 
constituents respectively. 
  This leaves the Bosnian Serbs at a loss of who they should 
negotiate with in the peace process? -- the Croats, Muslims or 
the Muslim-Croat federation's delegation. 
  The federation is practically being disregarded by its own 
constituents, which is evident from the fact that not even after 
its constituent assembly was held did any of its officials seek 
its international recognition. The Muslims and Croats are 
reluctant to do so because this would pave the way for an 
international recognition of the Bosnian Serb Republic too and 
bring into question Bosnia-Herzegovina's U.N. membership. They 
have complied with a sheer formality, deliberately evading to 
resolve one of the crucial issues -- territorial delineation. 
  Western analysts already portray the federation as nothing 
but a farce. This has recently been confirmed by Hans Koschick 
of Germany, the administrator of Mostar, who was appalled at the 
extent of the hate between Mostar's Muslims and Croats. After a 
year of bitter war over territories, the Bosnian Muslims and 
Croats, acting under strong pressure from the United States, 
agreed in Washington on March 18 to set up a binational 
federation, which would form confederal ties with neighbouring 
Croatia. 
  Political analysts assess that the federation was aimed at 
isolating the Bosnian Serbs and at pressuring them into 
accepting a peace settlement tailored to the needs of the West.

  [Text] In a letter addressed to the chairman of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Miro Lazovic, the Serbian Civic 
Council proposed that the next session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly includes a debate about the strategy toward the Serbian 
question and the constitutional position of the citizens of 
Serbian ethnicity on the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation. 
  The Serbian Civic Council proposes that the amendment to the 
constitution of the federation that was proposed at the last 
session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly forms the basis for 
the debate at the next session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly. The Serbian Civic Council believes that Legislation 
Minister Kasim Trnka, one of the authors of the Constitution of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and one representative of the 
Serbian Civic Council should speak about the position of the 
Serbs within the federation. It would be imperative to obtain 
the views and opinions of the constitutional commission of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and Government prior to the assembly 
session, is stated in a letter of the Serbian Civic Council to 
Miro Lazovic.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 2 Jun -- Special UN envoy Yasushi Akashi 
had two hours of talks behind closed doors this evening in 
Geneva's Hotel Intercontinental with the delegation of the 
Bosnian Serb Republic. The delegation consisted of President 
Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic, commander in chief of 
the armed forces. TANJUG learned of the meeting from its sources 
in the Serb republic. Also attending the meeting was General 
Michael Rose, commander of the blue helmets in Bosnia, . 
  The topic of the talks was the question of the withdrawal of 
Serb forces from the 3-km zone around Gorazde, something which 
is being insisted upon by the Muslim side as a condition for 
participation in the Geneva conference. The continued presence 
of Serbs in the zone, as claimed by UN officials in Geneva is 
the reason for the fact that the Haris Silajdzic-led delegation 
failed to turn up for the opening of the conference on a 
comprehensive cease-fire, which had been scheduled to open today 
in Geneva. 
  According to Serb republic sources, Karadzic and Gen. Rose 
should inform Akashi late this evening whether the Serbs have 
withdrawn, as Karadzic has promised. 
  According to a statement of the Serb Republic Foreign 
Minister Buha given earlier this evening to TANJUG, there are 
prospects that the negotiations initiated by Akashi might 
nevertheless begin tomorrow. According to Buha, the Muslim 
delegation has arrived in Geneva and is having talks with the 
Croat delegation on the territorial division of the cantons in 
the newly-formed federation. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Instead of the announced peace negotiations in 
Geneva, unofficial talks were held this afternoon between 
Radovan Karadzic, president of the Serbian Republic, and Yasushi 
Akashi, envoy to the UN secretary general. Let us listen to 
Dragan Bozanic reporting from Geneva: 
  [Begin Bozanic recording] The result of the two-hour 
unofficial meeting between Yasushi Akashi and his closest 
military associates, Generals de Lapresle and Rose, with Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, Vice President 
Nikola Koljevic, and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha could solve 
the dilemma over whether the negotiations on the cessation of 
hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina will resume or not. 
  After the Serbian delegation and the Croatian one, headed by 
Kresimir Zubak, had already arrived here in Geneva, the Muslims 
said they would not attend the talks until the Gorazde 3-km 
exclusion zone was allegedly entirely respected. 
  After the UN forces in Gorazde investigate these claims this 
evening, it will be known whether the meeting on the cessation 
of hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is to be held at 
all. However, we have learned from unofficial sources in the 
Palais des Nations that the problem of withdrawing a small 
number of armed Serbian civilians from three villages near 
Gorazde can be successfully solved and that the representatives 
of all three warring sides will, after all, sit at the 
negotiating table tomorrow. This would mean that the 
international mediators' plans could be fulfilled: Making all 
three armies, above all the Muslim one, accept the cessation of 
hostilities; then one could also resume the consultations on a 
general solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina in 
the French town of Talloires near Geneva, most probably on 6 
June. [end recording]

  [Text] Geneva, June 3 (AFP) -- Serb forces resumed Friday 
their withdrawal from the UN-declared exclusion zone around 
Gorazde in eastern Bosnia, raising hopes that truce talks 
stalled since Thursday would be able to get under way, UN 
special envoy Yasushi Akashi said Friday. Speaking after a 
meeting with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, Akashi said 
he hoped the Geneva talks, aimed at securing an overall 
ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, could start on Saturday morning.

of the [Bosnian] Croat delegation and president of the 
Croat-Muslim Federation [of Bosnia-Herzegovina], said he will 
not take part in the cease-fire conference, which was to have

  [Text] Our correspondent at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs has reported on the memorandum distributed at the 
Council of Europe [CE] in Strasbourg on 26 May in connection 
with Romania's observance of the pledges it made at the time it 
joined that body. The document replies, point by point, and 
makes topical all the pieces of information contained in the 
Koenig-Jansson report. 
  After taking note of the conclusions in the report that show 
appreciation for the favorable basis existing in Romania to 
further pluralist democracy and after acknowledging the toilsome 
efforts made by the rapporteurs, the document points out certain 
outdated pieces of information which have been overtaken by 
recent evolutions in Romanian society as well as certain 
inaccurate or distorted pieces of information stemming from the 
fact that the sources were sometimes one-sided. 
  The memorandum also contains a number of additional 
clarifications, such as the fact that on 17 May Romania's 
president promulgated the law ratifying the European Convention 
on Human Rights and its additional protocols and that Romania 
acknowledges the exceptional importance of its adherence to the 
European Convention on the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and 
Degrading Punishment or Treatment of Persons, a document which 
it signed on 4 November 1993. 
  The competent commissions of parliament are examining two 
draft laws on ethnic minorities, one elaborated by the UDMR 
[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania] and a second one 
elaborated by the parliamentary group of [non-Hungarian] ethnic 
minorities in the Chamber of Deputies. The education draft law 
currently being debated in parliament is based on the 
stipulations of the Constitution, which guarantee the right of 
persons belonging to ethnic minorities to study in their mother 
tongues and their right to education in their mother tongues. 
The aforementioned draft law, the memorandum assesses, 
surpasses the existing standards of the CE in the domain of 
education and training in the mother tongues of ethnic 
minorities. 
  The document elaborated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
also presents further information which has been made topical or 
supplemented, ensuring the CE that Romania's Government will 
make all necessary efforts to accomplish, as soon as possible, 
all the pledges made at the time of the country's adherence to 
that body. 
  In view of the fact that the procedures used in the process 
of verifying are still being discussed by the [CE] Committee of 
Ministers, the document assesses that the current system of 
reports, in its existent form, is an outdated method of 
verification.

  NEW BANKNOTE: The Bank of Albania has informed ATA that as 
of 27 April, it will be issuing a new 100-lek banknote. As of 1 
May, the old 100-lek notes that were printed in 1964 and 1976 
will be withdrawn from circulation. The deadline for replacing 
the old notes will be 1 May 1995. The Bank of Albania has 
reiterated that the deadline for returning the old 25-lek notes 
is 1 September. This notice was originally published last 
September. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  TIRANA-BOLOGNA AIRLINE: Another airline has been established 
between Albania and Italy. A direct line connecting Tirana and 
Bologna has been operating since last week. The inauguration 
flight was organized by the Albanian Airlines Association on the 
afternoon of 26 April. Paolo Foresti, Italian ambassador in 
Tirana, and other Albanian authorities were among the passengers 
on board. (Tirana ATA in English 1203 GMT 27 Apr 94) 
  EDUCATION PACT WITH SWISS: An agreement on cooperation in 
the 
field of professional education and the encouragement of 
small-industrial business in the Durres district was signed at 
the Ministry of Education in Tirana today. The agreement 
envisages a contribution of 1,895,000 Swiss francs to be 
provided for the realization of a respective project over a 
period of three years. For the Albanian party, the agreement 
was signed by Education Minister Xhezair Teliti and Minister of 
Labor, Emigration, and Social Assistance Dashamir Shehi, while 
for the Swiss party by Christian Hazbirt, charge d'affaires of 
the Swiss Government to Albania. (Tirana ATA in English 1758 
GMT 29 Apr 94) 
  SWISS RECONSTRUCTION ASSISTANCE: The spokesman of the Mining 
and Energy Resources Ministry reports that the Swiss Government 
has prepared a draft agreement for the reconstruction of 
hydropower stations built on the Drini River and the reduction 
of losses in the Albanian electric network. These two draft 
agreements were the focus of discussions between a Swiss 
delegation, headed by Daniel Staufaher, chief sector at the 
Ministry of Economy, and the Albanian side, represented by 
officials of the Ministries of Mining and Energy Resources and 
Finance and the Albanian Electro-Energy Corporation. The draft 
agreement for the hydropower reconstruction foresees a donation 
of 10.5 million Swiss francs, while the one regarding the 
reduction of electric network losses an amount of 3.7 million 
Swiss francs. (Tirana ATA in English 1000 GMT 30 Apr 94) 
  FARMERS BUY MACHINES: Farmers in the Has district, a 
mountainous area in northeast Albania, bought 145 mechanized 
agricultural implements last year. This was made possible by 
loans provided by the state to this area, which is one of the 
poorest in the country. Among various types of machinery, we 
can mention 50 belarus tractors and cultivators. Has was 
previously part of the Kukes district, but with the new 
administrative realignments carried out two years ago, Has 
became a separate district. Despite great difficulties during 
the transition period, particularly those related to the 
distribution of land to private farmers, agricultural production 
has increased due to the hard work of the farmers and the 
credits made available by the state. (Tirana ATA in English 
1004 GMT 30 Apr 94) 
  EXPORTS INCREASE: According to data from the Statistics 
Institute, Albanian exports reached an amount of 28,208,000 leks 
in the first quarter of 1994. During the same period last year, 
exports were only worth 1,469,000 leks. Among the principal 
commodities exported were minerals such as ferro-chromium, 
copper, and items manufactured using aluminum and chromium. A 
large number of medical herbs was also exported. Some 
commodities, such as oranges, lemons, fish, cognac, and 
kerosene, are both exported and imported. Reports from the 
Statistical Institute confirm that exports to Italy make up 67.9 
percent of the total, those to the United States 8.56 percent, 
and those to Greece 7.19 percent. Export figures were the 
highest in February, with a trade volume of 1,388,000 leks. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1006 GMT 30 Apr 94) 
  BUILDING SITES BOUGHT: In a recent article, the LAJMI I 
DITES newspaper considered the activity of companies acquiring 
construction sites directly from private owners to be an 
encouraging economic indicator. Data on state properties and 
those whose ownership needs to be juridically determined are 
still missing. With title deeds of so much land still 
uncertain, construction firms are hard pressed to find 
economically viable projects. A number of real estate companies 
have been opened in Tirana to assist investors in finding sites 
to establish their businesses. The companies assist with sales, 
purchases, and rentals of real estate. (Tirana ATA in English 
1201 GMT 30 Apr 94) 
  ASSISTANCE FOR MEDICAL SERVICE: The Dorkas Association, 
which 
has been working in Korce district for two and a half years, 
hopes to assist 185 medical centers in Korce, Pogradec, Kolonje, 
and Devoll through its project. The aproximately $1-million 
assistance consists of emergency equipment, surgical equipment, 
stethoscopes, and other facilities. The first contingents of aid 
reached Korce recently, thus marking the first stage of the 
project. During this stage, a new medical center of European 
standards will be built in Pojan in Korce. The project is being 
financed by the Belgian Government through Dorkas and will be 
carried out in cooperation with the Albanian Ministry of Health 
and Environmental Protection. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 2 
May 94) 
  BANK'S OPERATIONS: The Fier Commerce Bank last year provided 
credits to buy 170 autotractors of different types, without 
including here the agriculture machinery that was provided by 
the Aggro Commerce Bank. Kastriot Orizaj, the Fier Bank 
director, told an ATA correspondent that "the bank carries out 
2,000-3,000 operations a day worth 30-40 million leks, which 
ranks this bank as one of the most powerful in Albania." During 
last year, the bank realized a profit of 32.8 million leks. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1004 GMT 3 May 94) 
  PRIVATIZATION IN KUKES: Out of 120 trade units, only 46 so 
far are considered to be privatized in Kukes district. The 
units, which are not privatized yet, have been forcibly occupied 
by the former land owners, who are using them without being 
registered in the tax office. The storehouses of the state 
trade enterprise, worth 1.1 million leks, are not yet 
privatized, although all the necessary documents are ready. No 
one dares to buy them because they fear a possible conflict with 
the former land owners. (Tirana ATA in English 1006 GMT 3 May 
94) 
  PRIVATE SECTOR WORKERS: The number of workers employed in 
the private sector is increasing in Tropoje. Some 1,732 workers 
are actually working in the private sector, with some 40 percent 
employed in trade activity, 20 percent in artisanship, 10 
percent in construction, etc. Din Prengizi, chairman of the 
district tax office, told ATA that salaries in the private 
sector are higher than those given by the state. An average 
monthly salary for someone employed in the private sector is 
4,600 leks. (Tirana ATA in English 1007 GMT 3 May 94) 
  JOINT GAS VENTURE: Albpetrol and the Italian company "Api" 
SPA recently signed in Rome an agreement to create the 
"Albpetrol-Api" joint venture. The venture will fill and 
distribute liquid gas for heating and cooking from the Ballsh 
plant. Based on the contract, the Italian company will 
initially bring to Albania 10,000 gas bouteilles, together with 
necessary accessories and will systemize the equipment for 
filling with liquid gas at the Ballsh plant. The joint venture 
will also be involved in fuel distribution undertaking the 
reconstruction, within a 14 months period, of 6 distributors 
which now belong to Albpetrol. The total of the Api investments 
amount to 2.2 billion lire and the profits realized by the joint 
venture will be reinvested in Albania in conformity with the 
goal of its activity. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 3 May 94) 
  EU GRANT FOR PRISONS: Premton Gervalla, the European Union 
(EU) representative at the Justice Ministry, told ATA that "in 
the context of the PHARE (Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland 
and Hungary) program, the EU recently accorded a 1.2 million ECU 
assistance to improve the prison buildings in Albania. The 
amount will be given after both the Albanian and EU experts have 
completed the design phase, which will define the prisons where 
the assistance will be used. (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 3 
May 94) 
  TRADE UNITS INCREASE: Data from the Statistical Institute 
shows that in December 1993, Tirana had 15,000 trade units, 
compared to 900 in 1992 and 400 trade units and 230 instant 
trade services in 1991. In 1993, there were 2,000 companies 
with Albanian capital and 1,500 with joint capital. During the 
first three months of 1994, the number of trade units increased 
to 16,000, thus employing 35,000 workers. Small business covers 
83 percent of the units. The Statistical Institute confirms 
that the amount of money cashed in the state bank during 1993 by 
trade units was 3.3 times higher. During the first three months 
of 1994, the amount cashed by units was 20 percent higher. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1014 GMT 9 May 94) 
  TIRANA-DURRES HIGHWAY WORK: Construction work on the first 
Tirana-Durres highway began on 9 May. The government has 
invested $4,250,000 for its first 5 km. The construction work 
will be carried out by an Italian-Albanian joint venture called 
Euroteorema-Peqin. Attending the inauguration ceremony was 
Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, who laid the corner stone. 
Ministers, local government officials, World Bank 
representatives, and Italian Ambassador Paolo Foresti were also 
present. The first 5 km will be finished within five months, at 
which time other investors will provide for further construction 
of the highway. (Tirana ATA in English 1012 GMT 10 May 94) 
  PLANT TO CLOSE: The Agency for the Restructuring of 
Enterprises is going to initiate procedures to close down the 
Nickel-Cobalt Plant in Elbasan. Albanian and World Bank 
specialists have reached the conclusion that the plant is 
inefficient, with no possibility of being restructured in the 
future. In its 4 May meeting, the government granted permission 
to start the procedures. The Nickel- Cobalt Plant, known as the 
12th plant of the Steelworks Combine in Elbasan, has 
continuously been inefficient and has had many problems since 
its inauguration in 1979, which was clamorously appraised by the 
propaganda of the time. Specialists say that its technological 
byproducts have always been dangerous for the workers' health 
and that its products were of low quality. The state has made 
annual investments in the plant ranging from 20-70 million leks. 
The plant interrupted its production only at the end of 1990 
when the state did not subsidize it and when its efficiency 
faced the market economy. A negative consequence of the plant's 
work has been the environmental pollution caused by failures in 
the dust purification system and the leakage of poisonous 
liquids and gas. The smog created by the plant polluted the 
environment of Elbasan city and the Shkumbini River, which 
sometimes pushed the polluted water above the set norms. A 
group of Chinese specialists offered to help rebuild the plant, 
but an agreement was not reached because of its non-profitable 
nature. (Tirana ATA in English 1022 GMT 10 May 94) 
  TELECOM AFFILIATE RESTRUCTURING: Sokol Zotaj, acting 
director of the Tirana Telecom affiliate, told ATA that the 
restructuring of the Telecom affiliate in Tirana will consist in 
purchasing and operating computers, computerizing the process of 
preparing the bills, and changing the practice of sending 
invoices to telephone subscribers from the telephone paying 
offices to their homes. The new organization is expected to be 
able to solve the conflicts created between the Tirana affiliate 
and telephone subscribers, which have sometimes been sent to 
court. Subscribers do not pay their bills because they say the 
number of impulses has been manipulated. There are two 
alternatives that cannot be sorted out until everything is 
computerized, as there is a possibility of tapping onto others' 
telephone lines or irregularities in defining the number of 
impulses by Telecom. (Tirana ATA in English 1027 GMT 10 May 94) 
  BANK DEPOSITS: Artan Santo, deputy general director of the 
Savings Bank, told ATA that deposits by Albanians amount to 13 
billion leks since 1991. In 1991, deposits were 3.4 billion 
leks, while in 1992 they amounted to 5.6 billion leks. Although 
interest rates have been reduced from 33 to 24 percent, the 
number of depositors has been on the rise. Their number has now 
reached 600,000 people. In order to create facilities for 
depositing money, the Savings Bank plans to open 10 service 
centers in June. Installed mainly at customs points in Albania, 
the centers will also exchange other currencies. (Tirana ATA in 
English 1207 GMT 10 May 94) 
  TELECOM PLAN: Sokol Zotaj, director of the Tirana affiliate 
of Telecom, states that "Telecom is now getting down to 
business." Zotaj pointed out that by installing new phone 
numbers, priority will be attached to businessmen, officials, 
sick people, and former political persecutees. Based on a 
master plan that was prepared in early 1993, it is expected that 
there will be 12,000 phone numbers in 1996 and 33,000 in 2002. 
A commission with representatives from the Tirana affiliate and 
the Tirana municipality has been established because the 
affiliate is not able to meet all the citizens' demands for 
phone numbers. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 11 May 94) 
  LICENSES: According to the General Department of Minerals, 
very few companies so far have requested a license to use 
mineral resources. Meanwhile, there are several construction 
companies which, together with Italian partners, have set up 
equipment for producing inert materials. The law that was 
approved two months ago regards these materials as mineral 
resources, so those who do not have a license are obliged to pay 
a fine that varies from $3,500- 350,000 in conformity with the 
law. The construction companies have claimed that they are 
still "in the phase of preparing documents." (Tirana ATA in 
English 1012 GMT 11 May) 
  AIRLINE PLANS START: Arberia Airways, an airline company 
founded in December 1992, based in Tirana, and with an initial 
capital worth $1.5 million, is now ready to start flights from 
Tirana to Zurich, Geneva, Brussels, Hamburg, Dusseldorf, and 
Skopje, RILINDJA writes, citing a statement by Selaudin Sinani, 
the company's director. Some 40 tourist agencies that operate 
in Albania signed contracts for cooperation with Arberia Airways 
at the Makedonia Hotel in Tetova, having at the same time the 
opportunity to buy shares in the company. Another meeting to 
sign contracts was held in Germany and Switzerland one week ago, 
in which the participants agreed to cooperate. Besides Albanian 
Airlines, a joint venture with Austrian capital and Ada Air, a 
private company with French capital, Arberia Airways is the 
third company set up in Albania after the overthrow of the 
communist regime. (Tirana ATA in English 1030 GMT 13 May 94) 
  PLANT CLOSES: The Albanian Government recently authorized 
the 
Agency for Restructuring of Enterprises to close down the Soda 
Plant in Vlore. Its production was suspended three years ago 
due to a serious situation in the plant. The studies by the 
World Bank and the Institute of Studies and Projects of Chemical 
Technology in Tirana confirm that the plant has turned out to be 
ineffective and with no possibility for restructuring. During 
the last three years, the plant has recorded losses amounting to 
millions of leks. The Soda Plant was built in 1967 and its 
technology is Chinese. The plant was becoming a source of 
pollution for the environment of the Vlore coastal area, which 
is ranked as one of the best tourist locations in Albania. 
(Tirana ATA in English 1204 GMT 13 May 94) 
  FUNDS FOR MEDICINE, EDUCATION: Kudret Shalesi, chairman of 
the Tirana District Council, informed ATA that this year the 
council will receive funds from the state budget worth 
277,295,000 leks. The main part of the funds, some 172,705,000 
and 50,411,000 leks, will be granted to the medical and 
educational sectors respectively. Construction, trade, and 
agriculture will be granted increase, too. The education budget 
for the whole district will be 22 times higher compared to a 
year ago. The rise will mean an increase in teachers' salaries. 
At the same time, the expenses for the medical service will be 
45 times higher compared to last year. The council has set up 
another fund for the cultural sector, amounting to 870,000 leks. 
The funds for the Construction Ministry will be mainly used for 
cleaning, greening, maintenance of roads, drainage, and public 
fountains. The council has also foreseen a rise in funds for 
fisheries. (Tirana ATA in English 1010 GMT 14 May 94) 
  LICENSES FOR COMMERCIAL BANKS: The leading board of the 
Albanian National Bank approved new procedures to issue licenses 
to open commercial banks, which will include private banks with 
local and foreign capital, joint capital, and shareholding 
banks. The package of new regulations, which has been compiled 
by Albanian bankers in cooperation with foreign experts, 
complies with the key monetary principles in the present banking 
world. One of the fundamental requests for issuing the license 
is the existence of an initial minimum capital of $500,000. Also 
required for the license is the governing capability of bank 
initiators -- so that at least one of its main leaders has 
long-term banking experience and a good reputation -- as well as 
the introduction of a reliable business plan. (Tirana ATA in 
English 1030 GMT 14 May 94) 
  SHKODER AQUEDUCT: From this year's budget, the government 
has 
allocated $127,000 to restructure the Shkoder aqueduct. That 
will considerably improve the situation in the existing network 
of aqueducts so as to ensure greater supplies of drinking water 
to Shkoder inhabitants. The Projects Institute in Tirana will 
draft the restructuring project. Then a tender will be conducted 
to select the winner for the restructuring. All rehabilitation 
work is envisaged to be over in 1994. (Tirana ATA in English

  FOUNDATION ASSISTS FARMERS: Recently, the Albiran Foundation 
brought to Albania 25 75-horsepower tractors and other 
agricultural equipment, worth $1 million. Albanian 
Radio-Television cited the foundation managers as saying that 
the creation of the agricultural equipment base has a human 
character because, with the tractors, the farmers will carry out 
agricultural services at lower tariffs than those carried out by 
private tractor drivers. They also said that during September, 
the Albiran Foundation will invest another $1 million to improve 
the irrigation system in the Vore region, near Tirana. They 
will establish an agricultural repair shop and training center.

Coca-Cola company, which is the world's most renowned for the 
production of soft drinks, was inaugurated today. Franco Busi, 
president of the Busi Group, the main investing partner, said 
that "in the annual meeting of the company council in Atlanta,

at an age to know what revival means, and at present, Albania is 
at a stage in its revival." The factory is a joint venture of 
the Italian producer "Busi Group Acie," the Albanian Government, 
and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD]. 
The total investment value amounts to $9.5 million, of which 
the biggest part, 12 percent, is covered by "Busi Group Acie" 
and "Coca-Cola Company," whereas the Albanian party "Invest Pije 
Freskuese" possesses the land at an investment value of 6 
percent. For the time being, the factory will produce only 
bottled Coca-Cola for the local market. The factory's capacity 
will be 16,000 bottles per hour, at the price of 25 leks per 
bottle. At present, some 30 people have been employed in the 
factory, but this number will increase alongside the factory's 
capacity, amounting to 70 next month, and 100 later. (Tirana 
ATA in English 1047 GMT 19 May 94) President Sali Berisha said 
that "the establishment of the Coca-Cola Bottling Enterprise of 
Tirana is an important step in building industry and encouraging 
investment in a production facility in our country. We very 
much welcome the Coca- Cola company's development of this new 
facility." The modern bottling facility began production today 
and will initially bottle Coca-Cola in 200 cc -- refillable 
glass bottles in the famous contour shape. Production of Fanta 
and Sprite will start later. (Tirana ATA in English 1819 GMT 19

  ALBKROM VENTURE WITH GERMANS: The decision that the Albkrom 
Managing Board made recently once again testified to the 
priority of German investments in Albania. Out of four foreign 
companies, the Albkrom Corporation chose the German group BSE to 
continue final negotiations for the establishment of a joint 
venture. The selection was based on a cooperation platform, the 
estimation of Albkrom resources, and the investments the German 
group offered. The latter drafted a plan for modernizing the 
Bulqize Mine, as well as six other ambitious projects to invest 
in Albania. The spokesman of the Ministry of Energy and Mining 
Resources said that the German group will continue negotiations 
with Albkrom for a period of four weeks, before signing a 
contract. All prospects show that an agreement will be signed 
and a joint venture will start activity soon. (Tirana ATA in 
English 1021 GMT 23 May 94) 
  RADIO, TV ADVERTISING: Mirela Bezhani of the Marketing 
Department at Tirana Radio reported that income from 
advertisements doubles every three months. Tirana Radio, the 
only one in Albania, receives a new advertisement every week 
worth 7,000 new leks. The first advertisement was broadcast in 
1992 and cost 5,000 new leks. Since then, the radio has 
broadcast various advertisements, except for those of a 
political or religious character or those that advertise 
alcoholic and narcotic products. The advertisements are 
requested mainly by joint ventures. Payment is the same for 
Albanian and foreign companies. The TV broadcast its first 
advertisement after 1990. Azis Jata, chief of the Marketing 
Department, states that "advertisements occupy about 15 percent 
of the satellite broadcast program. We have so far settled the 
price according to supply and demand, but later it will depend 
on the size of audience, confirming that for 1993, the TV 
incomes from advertisements were 11 times higher than those 
during 1992." Thirty percent of the income goes to the state 
budget, while 70 percent is managed by the TV for 
administration, investment, and employees' salaries. (Tirana 
ATA in English 1212 GMT 23 May 94) 
  PRICE INDEX: Recent data from the Statistics Institute 
confirms that the retail price index amounted to 113.8 percent 
as against December 1993. Compared to March 1994, in April the 
index had a 9-percent increase. Compared to the same period 
last year, the rise is 32.8 percent. Such an increase was 
expected not only due to a price rise in retail goods, such as 
kerosene, electricity, and telephone tariffs, but also to a 
price rise in fruit. During April, the price of fruit increased 
by 17.4 percent. The prices of food articles had an increase of 
1.5 percent as compared with the previous month. As for 
alcoholic drinks, only beer had a considerable price rise -- 11

enterprise, and others. Many foreign investors, such as 
representatives from the German firm "Vogel Revizion Gmbh, the 
Vienna District Council, Slovene and Croatian firms, have come

energy, asphalt-concrete, gas, and the telephone network. Kusi 
confirms that foreign investors are welcomed in many industrial 
enterprises of Tirana, such as the Glass Factory and timber and 
handicraft enterprises, which possess abundant free productive 
capacities. (Tirana ATA in English 1029 GMT 25 May 94) 
  INVESTMENT IN COMMERCIAL BANKS: The package of new 
regulations that were recently adopted regarding the opening of 
new commercial banks, classifies them according to the sphere of 
bank operations. For the new banks to start activity, the Bank 
of Albania has defined an initial investment that varies from 
500,000 to $7 million. The banks that are supposed to expand 
their activity in over five districts will be called national 
banks, while those covering a smaller area will be called 
regional banks. (Tirana ATA in English 1031 GMT 25 May 94)

  COMPANIES TO BE PRIVATIZED: At a meeting in Sofia on 25 
April, the management of the Privatization Agency decided to 
offer for sale the Hemus Air Company and the Yugoplod canning 
plant in Khaskovo. 
  Hemus Air had an turnover of 63 million leva in 1993, and

  PROFITS AT BURGAS PORT: In 1993 the Port of Burgas netted 
profits of 17.7 million leva as a result of a 34-percent rise in 
the volume of cargo handled, compared with 1992. The port is 
one of the few such facilities in Bulgaria that invested in 
procuring modern cargo handling equipment. The business 
prospects this year are just as good, mainly because of the 
plans to handle 1 million metric tons of cargo for Macedonia. 
At the same time, Transport Ministry figures show that the 
annual profits of the other major Black Sea port, in Varna, are 
steadily declining. Varna earned mere 7 million leva in 1993, 
down from 26 million leva in 1992. (Sofia BTA in English 1113

fixed assets total 43.5 million leva, and the post-consolidation 
basic capital amounts to 551 million leva. The press reported

economy faces, foreign companies still depend upon their 
Bulgarian partners and seek expansion of contacts with them, 
Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev said when he opened the 
Spring '94 International Plovdiv Fair on 2 May. A total of 1,260 
companies are taking part: 742 from Bulgaria and 518 foreign 
companies from 34 countries. The Plovdiv Spring Fair

London-Sofia passenger service after a 12-year break. From now 
on BA will have three weekly flights on the London-Sofia-London 
route, which until now has been serviced only by the state-owned 
Balkan Airlines of Bulgaria. A delegation of high-ranking BA

the year and four were liquidated, DEMOKRATSIYA reported on 4 
May, citing official figures. These companies produced U.S.$5 
net profit per head of population, as against $9 dollars in 
Albania and 2 dollars in Romania. So far the inflow of foreign 
capital this year has been thin, contrary to expectations of 
high growth, following a favorable settlement of the foreign 
debt issue. DEMOKRATSIYA also notes that, according to experts, 
Bulgarian-Arab and Bulgarian-Greek companies importing mostly 
low-quality products into Bulgaria will account for the majority 
of joint ventures. (Sofia BTA in English 1118 GMT 4 May 94)

ex-executive director of the bankrupt Jess Air carrier. Jess 
Air folded owing its pilots and flight attendants 7 months' pay.

Phoenix Air a license because of Jess Air's debts, which are now 
the subject of legal proceedings. (Sofia BTA in English 1118

government institutions, will share in building the project 
infrastructure, Milenov told the press. The Defense Ministry 
will help attract other government departments to the project, 
establishing a special investment fund, presenting the project 
to foreign investors. The project consists of 450-500 apartments 
for servicemen's families and a number of other buildings on a 
4-hectare plot owned by the Defense Ministry. The housing

produced revenues valued at 65 million leva (U.S.$1.1 million), 
DUMA reported on 5 May in an article based on the annual reports 
of the five largest companies operating in the free trade zones. 
In 1992 the companies' revenues totalled 32.5 million leva. 
Last year the parliament adopted an act repealing the tax 
concessions granted to companies in the free trade zones, which

quotes Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov as saying that 2,400 
of Bulgaria's 250 brokerages and 3,000 foreign exchange offices 
are violating the foreign exchange regulations. According to 
DUMA, the minister said that exchange offices often open without 
a license from the Bulgarian National Bank and neither the bank 
supervision body nor the Finance Ministry are capable of 
exercising efficient control. He is further reported as saying 
it is not within the tax administration's powers to exercise 
foreign-exchange control, all the more that its officers lack 
the expertise required and are easily corruptible. (Sofia BTA

  JAPANESE TRADE INSURANCE: "The Japanese Government decided 
to reopen Trade Insurance of Japanese exports and investment in 
Bulgaria and to extend a credit-line amounting to 200 million 
dollars," Japanese Ambassador Buheita Fujiwara said at a press 
conference here today. Fujiwara explained that the decision was 
taken in connection with Bulgaria's successful multilateral 
agreement with the Paris Club on April 13. He stressed that 
Japan is reopening trade insurance before the completion of the 
negotiations between Bulgaria and the separate official 
creditors on the size of the foreign debt interests. Japan 
suspended trade insurance to Bulgaria in 1990 following the 
moratorium on Bulgaria's foreign debt payments. The acceptance 
of trade insurance is scheduled to start on 15 May. Japanese 
companies will pay fees and conclude insurance contracts with 
the Japanese Government for exporting goods and investment in 
Bulgaria and the government will compensate them should an 
insurance event take place, Fujiwara explained. According to 
him, the reopening of the system will make it possible for 
high-quality Japanese goods and equipment to enter Bulgaria and 
to update Bulgarian production. Fujiwara said that the 
Bulgarian Government too wants to establish its own system of 
trade insurance and Japan is ready to cooperate with Japanese 
experts and with the training of Bulgarian experts. (Sofia BTA

expected in the Sofia region, where the water in the Iskur dam 
is very low. Land ownership confusion, the need to urgently 
restore plundered pump stations and pipelines, the theft of 
water, and unpaid water supply bills are among the other 
problems that the Agriculture Ministry must solve to guarantee a 
normal irrigation season. (Sofia BTA in English 1349 GMT 17 May 
94) 
  OIL COMPANIES CONSORTIUM: According to the 24 CHASA daily, 
10 private oil companies plan to form a consortium. It is 
expected to include Eastern Petroleum, Multigroup-Bulgaria, 
MFI-Petroleum, Petromax, Elpida-3, Bulvaria, Omnitex, and 
others. The consortium will approach the Cabinet to ask for 
equal treatment of Bulgarian and foreign companies. It will 
also insist that at least 50 percent of finished oil products 
are sold on the domestic market. The private businessmen claim 
that the Neftokhim Oil Refinery in Burgas charges foreign 
companies half the processing fee paid by Bulgarian companies. 
The consortium also intends to develop programs for 
environment-friendly oil production. (Sofia BTA in English 1158 
GMT 18 May 94) 
  MAGNETIC DISC FOR RUSSIA: Arkadiy Golubko, head of the 
Committee of Information Science with the Russian President's 
Office, and Rafail Sarkisiyan, Executive manager of Disc Memory 
Storage Devices (DZU) of Stara Zagora, agreed to cooperate in 
the production of magnetic discs, TRUD reports today. DZU is 
fully capable of meeting the Russian market demand amounting to 
200,000 discs per year, the daily adds. (Sofia BTA in English 
0947 GMT 20 May 94) 
  APRIL PRODUCTION DECLINE: The National Statistics Institute 
(NSI) reports that industrial production declined by 6 percent 
in April 1994 as compared with a year previously, completely 
canceling out the zero decline recorded in March. About half of 
the recorded fall is attributed to the food and tobacco 
industry. In the first quarter of 1994 the output of the economy 
fell by 2.4 percent as compared with the same quarter in 1993. 
The NSI calculated inflation from the start of the year until 
the end of April at almost 42 percent: food commodities rose in 
price by 48 percent, nonfood goods by 41.3 percent, and services 
by 24.9 percent. NSI official Velichka Rangelova predicts that 
1994 inflation will exceed 50 percent in May. She explains that 
this means that even if the dollar exchange rate is maintained, 
which is doubtful, 1994 inflation will certainly be higher than 
in the previous year. If the dollar rises, inflation is likely 
to exceed 100 percent, which wOULD be a severe blow. (Sofia 
KONTINENT in Bulgarian 20 May 94 p 1) 
  G-24 GRANT: Finance Minister Stoyan Aleksandrov announced 
that at its meeting in Brussels the Group of 24 confirmed it 
will grant Bulgaria ECU 150 million in aid. Talks with the G-24 
will continue on 9 and 10 June in Paris to determine concrete 
investment projects will be discussed. Aleksandrov said that at 
the meeting in Brussels last week Bulgaria was reproached for 
the delay in the reform, the imperfections of legislation, and 
the slow pace of privatization. At the end of this month a group 
of G-24 experts will arrive here to work out an agreement on the 
first of the two envisaged tranches. This morning Finance 
Minister Aleksandrov returned from Athens where he attended the 
first international banking congress on the problems of 
cooperation between the countries of southern and Eastern 
Europe. (Sofia BTA in English 1051 GMT 25 May 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Ibolya Veres: "Bekesi: If the Prime Minister Is </F>
an Economic Expert, There Is No Need for a Deputy"] 
  [Text] With the approach of the government change, the 
question whether there will be an main economic ministry is 
becoming increasingly more important. What kind of 
reorganizations are the party that was victorious at the 
elections planning for the economic ministries? It makes a 
difference whether the government begins its operation by 
establishing a new state administration structure -- which takes 
quite some time -- or if it keeps the existing structure. We 
interviewed Laszlo Bekesi, the number one economic expert for 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], on this issue. 
  It is very important to have an economic policy center. It 
has to be achieved that the spheres of authority for 
decision-making and preparation do not clash, which requires a 
suitable institutional structure, Bekesi said. He considers the 
current system untenable because the spheres of authority are 
fragmented between the Office of the Prime Minister, the Finance 
Ministry, and sometimes the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Relations, or the Industry and Agriculture Ministries. 
According to Bekesi, all this is not satisfactory and, instead, 
integration is the main goal. 
  In his view, a threefold structure is needed. Based on the 
Finance Ministry, an main economic ministry has to be 
established to governs the macro-processes, the balancing 
processes, medium and long-term strategies, economic 
integration, and state finances. The finance minister who heads 
this ministry also has to be the leader of the economic cabinet. 
Bekesi believes that the view that the Finance Ministry should 
be turned into an office solely for tax and budget affairs does 
not correspond to the current Hungarian situation. This might 
be the future way, but it cannot be implemented at the moment, 
Bekesi claims. Should the finance minister responsible for 
economic control also fulfill the function of deputy prime 
minister? In Bekesi's view, this depends on whether the prime 
minister is an economic expert. If he is, then there is no need 
for the finance minister to be a deputy prime minister at the 
same time. However, if the prime minister is not an economic 
expert then the finance minister responsible for the economy 
must also be a deputy prime minister. 
  Another ministry will have to deal with the tasks of the 
economic branches, governing the real economic processes, market 
protection, concrete foreign economic relations, and technical 
development. This ministry has to be established on the basis of 
the current Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, by merging 
the Industry and Trade Ministry and some sections of the 
National Technical Development Committee [OMFB], Bekesi claims. 
  The third economic ministry will have to fulfill diverse 
tasks in the areas of infrastructure and regional-development, 
Bekesi believes.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Ejup Ganic, vice president of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, this afternoon held a news 
conference on the reasons the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation has 
not gone to the Geneva peace negotiations called by Yasushi 
Akashi. Here is a report by Mladen Bosnjak: 
  [Bosnjak] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressed at the outset that he wanted to 
comment on two issues: the first being the failure of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation to go to Geneva, and the second in 
connection with Tuzla airport, following reports today that 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] allowed a (?Serbian) observer to 
be present at the airport. Here is Mr. Izetbegovic explaining 
why the delegation did not go to Geneva. 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] Our condition was that 
Karadzic's Serbs withdraw from Gorazde. They had not withdrawn 
by noon today. We established this fact after talks with our 
representatives in Gorazde. This was also confirmed by UNPROFOR 
and Mr. Akashi [words indistinct]. The meeting has therefore 
been canceled and we are not to be blamed for it. 
  We even made a concession in Gorazde by agreeing that our 
soldiers not enter the so-called exclusion zone -- a zone of 3 
km under UNPROFOR control -- only our civilians may enter it. 
Since this has not been implemented thus far, we are 
withdrawing this concession and demand that Resolution 913 be 
fully implemented. 
  Regarding Tuzla airport, we were informed today that 
UNPROFOR, without our approval and knowledge, allowed the 
arrival of a Serbian liaison officer at Tuzla airport. We have 
stated in the past that we do not accept any Chetnik force 
presence or their representatives at this airport. Therefore, 
we demand that UNPROFOR remove the chetniks from Tuzla airport. 
If it does not care to do that, it should then gives us the 
airport back. [end recording] 
  [Bosnjak] Ejup Ganic, member of the Presidency, vice 
president of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the head 
of our delegation that was supposed to travel to Geneva, was 
also categorical. The peace negotiations have been canceled by 
Mr. Yasushi Akashi himself. 
  [Begin Ganic recording in English with passage-by-passage 
translation into Serbo-Croatian] Let me make a brief statement 
that we heard from Geneva that Mr. Akashi made an announcement 
that he is canceling the talks, because Karadzic's Serbs had not 
satisfied the condition that Mr. Akashi had set for (?these 
talks). [end recording] 
  [Bosnjak] The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation will travel to 
Talloires for the talks convened by the contact group. The 
topic of these talks will be decided upon in association with 
members of the contact group. Kresimir Zubak, president of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, will travel to Talloires. He 
will not negotiate in Geneva either. 
  We will insist that the aggressor forces leave the Gorazde 
exclusion zone according to Resolution 913 and the NATO 
ultimatum. All civilians, including Serbs, who can prove that 
they used to live there may return to their homes in the Gorazde 
region. If the aggressor observer is not removed, we will 
demand that Tuzla airport be given back to us within a 
reasonable period of time, according to our agreement with 
UNPROFOR. These were short and clear answers by Mr. Izetbegovic 
to journalists' questions. 
  Mr. Izetbegovic briefly said, in answer to the last question 
at today's news conference posed by a Swiss journalist, namely, 
what the reasons were that our delegation did not go to the 
peace talks: 
  [Begin Izetbegovic recording] You have probably not 
understood that it was Akashi who canceled the meeting, having 
established that the Serbian side did not meet its obligations. 
This was not our fault. It is clear that this was not our 
fault. [end recording]

  [Text] After everything that has happened, what are the 
chances of a peace agreement being signed in Geneva and 
conditions created for at least a partial lifting of the 
sanctions against Yugoslavia? This is the question that Milada 
Citovic put to [Bosnian Serb] president Karadzic. 
  [Begin recording] [Karadzic] The Muslims have so far done 
everything to sabotage every conference, and the United States 
has generally helped them in this. I am afraid that if any one 
of us Serbs thinks that this is a serious conference on peace 
and that the sanctions will really be lifted and that, in the 
international community, it is primarily the United States that 
is striving for peace, he is gravely mistaken. They can achieve 
peace whenever they want because the Muslims are entirely 
obedient to the ones who issue the orders, and it is a fact that 
the United States -- that is, certain circles in the United 
States -- has instigated this war and is prolonging it to the 
extent that suits it. To put it succinctly, we Serbs should not 
fool ourselves -- this is a war for the West's goals; these 
goals have not been achieved by a long shot because we have kept 
them at bay with our defense in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
for a full two years. They have not succeeded in achieving 
anything that they planned to do in Serbia, and they are 
dissatisfied with the effect. That is why they will do 
everything to make the war last longer. 
  [Citovic] The Serbian side is unconditionally for peace and 
has agreed to negotiate a cessation of hostilities. However, 
the Contact Group for Bosnia also met today, and territorial 
demarcation was discussed. This is illogical. First, 
hostilities have to cease, and then this can be discussed. 
  [Karadzic] That is also our position. The most important 
thing is to stop the war, because it will be easier to negotiate 
in peace. On the other hand, it seems that the Contact Group is 
comprised of people who do not have enough authority and who do 
not have adequate maneuvering space. Therefore, negotiations 
with the Contact Group are somehow barren. 
  Simply, it is the Muslim map that is being passed around -- 
that is, certain variants of it -- and the entire Contact Group 
is presenting itself as the representative of the Muslims' 
interests. We do not have a direct connection or influence on 
the creation of these maps, our representative is not included 
in this Contact Group, and we do not have unbiased mediators to 
take into account the interests of all three sides. To put it 
succinctly, the Contact Group was designed to put pressure on 
the Serbs. It is not a group for achieving an agreement between 
the three sides. [end recording]

  [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the talks on 
the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina held in Geneva 
under the auspices of the Contact Group, Momcilo Krajisnik, 
president of the parliament of the Srpska republic, said today 
that "those who drew the maps did not at all accept" the Serb 
side's suggestions. According to the maps, "western Bosnia, the 
Posavina area, and eastern Bosnia are all problematic," 
Krajisnik told Serb Sarajevo television and TANJUG journalists. 
  "They are trying to take away the largest part of the 
corridor -- the towns of Derventa, Bosanski Brod, Odzak, Samac, 
and Orasje. There are also aspirations toward considerably 
enlarging the territories of the Muslim enclaves in eastern 
Bosnia, almost the whole of the left bank of the river Drina and 
the right bank near Gorazde." 
  We explained why we cannot discuss those areas, Krajisnik 
said. We expressed concern, Krajisnik went on to say, because 
the division of 51 percent and 49 percent is being insisted 
upon, rather than the quality of the territory. We reminded 
them that the Srpska republic assembly in Pale had found it 
difficult to accept even the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which 
allocated 53 percent of the territory to the Serbs, and the rest 
to what has now become the Muslim-Croat Federation. 
  Speaking about the stance of the Bosnian Serbs, Krajisnik 
said that it was a problem to go to the talks with pre-set 
percentages. He believes that each area should be discussed 
separately and viewed in the context of its distinct 
characteristics. 
  According to the Serb delegation, "the Muslims are not 
playing their own game, but an entire bloc is trying achieve its 
interests through the Muslim-Croat Federation, and it is trying 
-- on behalf of the Federation -- to adjust the territories of 
future states to its strategic needs." 
  "We know why they are insisting on eastern Bosnia. They need 
it as a springboard toward Serbia. As for the corridor, we will 
never agree on it being merely a road, a corridor. It has to be 
a populated area, an organic entity linking a Serb state" -- 
Krajisnik said. 
  In reference to the constant delays in the negotiations to 
cease hostilities, Serb Republic President Karadzic told 
journalists that "consistent rumors are coming from 
well-informed sources in Europe that the Muslims are being 
constantly driven into a conflict first with the Serbs then with 
the Croats by the people who wish them harm, who hope for their 
total extermination." 
  Karadzic said that the "Muslim side has again demonstrated 
that it favors war and that it is not willing to accept a 
peaceful solution for a period of four to six months, thus 
helping in the efforts to extinguish the conflagration in 
Bosnia." "The Muslims are not undermining the conference at 
their own initiative. To their detriment, someone is advising 
them to choose wrong tactics" -- Karadzic said. 
  "No one will go before the international community to 
justify 
their attempt to undermine the conference, and I therefore 
believe that in the end, someone, most likely some circles from 
America, will try to bring them eventually to the negotiating 
table," the Srpska republic president said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [By Dragan Milosavljevic] </F>
  [Text] Geneva, June 5 (TANJUG) -- An atmosphere of 
uncertainity prevails at Geneva's Palais de Nations where the 
fourth day in a row is passing in the expectation of the 
decision by the Moslem delegation to finally take part in the 
talks on a ceasefire in the two-year war in the ex-Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At 10:00 a.m. local time, when the several-times delayed 
talks were scheduled to begin on Sunday, the Bosnian Serb 
Republic (RS) delegation arrived headed by President Radovan 
Karadzic and military comander General Ratko Mladic. Karadzic 
told TANJUG that the Serb side is willing to sign a ceasefire. 
  The spokesman of the special U.N. envoy for the former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Sunday morning announced at a press 
conference that Akashi would meet for consultations with 
Moslem-Croat Federation Vice-President Ejup Ganic. Shortly 
afterward Ganic told journalists that the Serb forces had 
allegedly failed to withdraw from the 3-km exclusion zone in 
Gorazde and that the conditions for the start of the talks have 
still not been fulfilled. He thus tried to deny reports to the 
contrary by U.N. monitors from this Moslem enclave in eastern 
Bosnia. Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams could not say what 
the chances are for the talks starting on Sunday. 
  At the U.N. Geneva headquarters there are many skeptics who 
doubt that the Bosnian Moslems are ready for serious peace 
talks. Some believe that the entire affair aims to undermine 
the authority of Japanese diplomat Akashi whom the Moslems 
persistently and unfoundedly accuse of siding with the Serbs. 
  Williams also said that, according to his information, the 
first round of talks, sponsored by the "Contact Group," on a 
comprehensive political solution and territorial division in 
Bosnia, has been completed at the French U.N. mission. 
  Sources in the Bosnian Serb delegation said that the Serbs 
are dissatisfied by the maps proposed by the "Contact Group" in 
Washington because they are a basis for a unitary Bosnia, as 
adovcated by Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic.

  [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- The delegation of the 
Srpska Republic left the Palais des Nations in Geneva after 
several postponements of the talks on a cease-fire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic 
refused to say whether the delegation would return. 
  Earlier at a press conference Karadzic accused the Muslims 
of 
continually sabotaging the conference. "This is a great 
humiliation for the international community which bears the 
responsibility for these actions. Before the negotiations we 
were asked not to set any conditions, and we stuck to that. On 
the other hand, we are witnessing constant blackmail by the 
Muslims. There will be no peace without a cease-fire," Karadzic 
said and left the Palais des Nations with his delegation.

  [Text] The Geneva talks on ending hostilities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have not yet begun because the Serb 
withdrawal from around Gorazde was not confirmed by 1400. Jozo 
Curic reports: 
  [Curic] There has been no change since the 1400 deadline, 
when the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] were expected to 
confirm that the Serbs had withdrawn from two more points around 
Gorazde. 
  The Croat and Bosniak delegations, President Zubak, Minister 
Akmadzic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Vice President Ganic met 
in the Richmond Hotel in Geneva. New reports from Sarajevo say 
that nothing has changed on the ground. Negotiations on a 
four-month cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina, initiated here in 
Geneva on 13 May by the foreign ministers of the great powers 
and the European Union, cannot begin. 
  Federation President Zubak and Vice President Ganic held 
talks this morning with Yasushi Akashi and Generals Rose and de 
Lapresle, who are unsuccessfully trying to get the talks 
started. The position of the joint Croat-Bosniak delegation in 
the talks was that UNPROFOR should present a report confirming 
there were no Serb forces in the 3-km zone around Gorazde. Vice 
President Ganic said that Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi 
Akashi had not presented a new UNPROFOR report from the Gorazde 
area to the Croat-Bosniak delegation by 1400. 
  Karadzic, Akashi, de Lapresle, and Rose held talks this 
morning, lasting for nearly an hour, but without any visible 
results. After the talks Radovan Karadzic said that the Muslims 
are sabotaging the talks on ending the hostilities. Intensive 
diplomatic efforts continue. UNPROFOR has confirmed the 
presence of Serb forces within 2,200 metres of the center of 
Gorazde.

  [Text] Geneva, June 5 (TANJUG) -- The delegation of Bosnian 
Moslems on Sunday torpedoed for the fourth straight day the 
effort by U.N. special envoy to the former Yugoslavia Yasushi 
Akashi to make the warring sides in the civil-war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina sign a cessation of all hostilities. 
Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams said this afternoon that 
the Moslem delegation, dissatisfied with the situation around 
Gorazde where they said armed Serbs still remained, was about to 
return to Zagreb. 
  The delegation's statement was understood among conference 
circles as a fresh blackmail rather than the definitive decision. 
  In the afternoon at the Palace of Nations, three news 
conferences were held at which Williams spoke about Moslems's 
fresh assertions about the presence of armed Serbs on a hill 200 
metres within the 3-km zone from central Gorazde banned for 
armed soldiers. The final destiny of the talks is most likely 
to be known around 7 p.m. when Akashi would speak to reporters, 
Williams said. 
  There are many who believe that the undermining of the talks 
so far had been a scheme aimed at harming the good name of the 
Japanese diplomat. 
  In Sarajevo, UNPROFOR (U.N. Protection Force) Commander for 
the former Yugoslavia General Michael Rose said on Sunday that 
the evacuation of Serbs from the Gorazde zone had been completed 
and that this fact was well known to the local Moslem commander 
on the ground because he was combing the zone together with 
UNPROFOR. 
  The French AFP news agency learned from General Rose's aides 
that two or three Serbs were still on a strategically 
insignificant and hardly accessible hill a few metres within the 
banned zone. Sarajevo UNPROFOR spokesman Major Baker Halloway 
told the AFP that these three Serbs were not a threat to 
Gorazde, an eastern Bosnian enclave designated a safe area. 
  On Sunday morning, the delegation of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic, headed by President Radovan Karadzic and Army 
Commander General Ratko Mladic, arrived at the Palace of Nations 
on time. Karadzic reiterated to TANJUG's correspondent that the 
Serb side was prepared to sign peace. 
  In the afternoon, leaving the Palace of Nations, Karadzic 
said the Moslem delegation's behaviour meant the Moslems' 
dealing a blow to the international public. In Karadzic's 
words, well-informed circles in Europe assert that those who 
want Moslems exterminated were in fact pushing the Bosnian 
Moslems into conflicts now with Serbs and at other times with 
Croats. 
  Karadzic believed that the Moslems were not sabotaging the 
conference on their own initiative but that they, to their 
detriment, were persuaded to choose a wrong tactic.

  [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- We have unofficially 
learned from sources close to the delegation of the Srpska 
republic that late tonight, in talks between Yasushi Akashi, UN 
special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and representatives of 
the Serb and Muslim-Croat delegations, an agreement was 
eventually reached in principle to resume talks on a total 
cessation of hostilities in Bosnia. 
  These talks, as Radovan Karadzic and Ejup Ganic agreed, 
should start tomorrow at 1000 in the Palace of Nations in 
Geneva, the sources of the Serb republic say. The only 
precondition attached to this is a confirmation that "armed Serb 
elements" have withdrawn from the security zone, i.e. 3 km 
around Gorazde. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is expected to arrive in 
Geneva tonight. Akashi is believed to have invited the UN 
secretary general to help him in saving the conference and the 
reputation of the UN which is mediating in the peace talks. The 
Muslim delegation has for four days been finding reasons to 
delay the opening of the conference. 
  In all his contacts with the press Radovan Karadzic, head of 
the delegation of the Srpska republic, has been constantly 
saying: "We have come here to sign a peace and we do not set 
any conditions." 
  According to statements by Akashi's press officer, the 
conference has on several occasions been on the verge of being 
canceled.

  [Text] Geneva, 6 Jun (TANJUG) -- The talks on an absolute 
cease-fire in Bosnia, which have been postponed since last 
Thursday, should begin in the Palais des Nations in Geneva soon. 
Yasushi Akashi's spokesman Michael Williams has officially 
confirmed that "all Serb elements have left the 3-km exclusion 
zone around Gorazde, as required by the UN resolution." 
  A joint statement confirming this has been signed in Gorazde 
by representatives of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and the 
Muslim side, Williams said. A meeting between Yasushi Akashi, 
the UN secretary general's special envoy, and the vice president 
of the Croat-Muslim Federation will be held in the Palais des 
Nations first. The talks between the warring sides should 
follow.

  [Text] Geneva, June 6 (TANJUG) -- U.N. envoy to former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi said on Monday morning that all 
conditions had been created for Bosnia's belligerents to sit 
down at the conference table after armed Bosnian Serbs had 
withdrawn from the last controversial ridge around the Muslim 
enclave of Gorazde in the east. 
  The latest reports from the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
Command in Gorazde said that Bosnian Serb troops have withdrawn 
from the exclusion zone around the town, said Akashi. He 
explained that available information seemed to indicate that the 
conference might begin on Monday morning. 
  U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali arrived in Geneva 
during the night, in an effort to use his authority to help 
surmount controversial issues and finally open the conference on 
a general cessation of hostilities in Bosnia. 
  On Sunday night, Akashi had separate meetings with the 
Bosnian Serb and Muslim delegations, and indicated a certain 
reconciliation of stands from which it appeared that the 
conference might be held after all, after four days of delay. 
He said, however, that the Muslim side was still making its 
attendance conditional on receiving a report from its observers 
confirming that "armed Serb elements" had withdrawn from the 
exclusion zone around Gorazde. 
  In his most recent statement, Akashi said that the three 
sides were coming to the talks with different positions, but 
were willing that the conference, called at Geneva's Palais des 
Nations, should finally begin.

<F P=106> [Report on a statement by the spokesman for the Foreign </F>
Ministry; place and date not given -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Commenting on the statement by Theodhoros Pangalos, 
Greek minister for European affairs, who said that it was not 
Greece's veto but that of the European Community [EC] that 
blocked the assistance to Albania and that the EC has done this 
as a punishment for the violation of Greek minority rights in 
Albania, the Foreign Ministry spokesman has stated: 
  This is a completely insincere statement, and Mr. Pangalos 
knows this better than anyone else. By making such a statement, 
he is trying to hide the hand that has thrown the stone. 
  The truth is that the European Union [EU] assistance for 
Albania's balance of payments has been approved on all EU 
Commission and European Parliament levels and was blocked by the 
Greek representative at the meeting of EU economy ministers in 
Brussels on 16 May. The Greek representative put forth the veto 
and did not call for a consensus on whether this assistance 
should be granted to Albania as stipulated in earlier 
projections. 
  Other Greek representatives maintained the same stance in 
the 
last meeting of technical groups that discussed this question. 
The representatives of EU member countries have not only 
expressed their surprise but also their nonapproval of this 
Greek stance, as many of them have voiced this to the Albanian 
representatives. 
  Regarding the claim on the alleged violation of the Greek 
minority rights in Albania, we stress that the Albanian reality 
and the repeated reports by the CSCE high commissioner, the 
European Parliament, the Council of Europe, and the U.S. 
Congress clearly testify that this minority enjoys all the 
freedoms and rights set forth in the Copenhagen document. 
  With his last statement, Mr. Pangalos, seeking to share the 
responsibility of his government regarding the blocking of aid 
for Albania along with the other member countries, hopes to 
freeze Albania's relations with the EU and its member countries. 
However, this attempt has failed because Albanians know quite 
well that embargoes and blockades for the purpose of 
nationalistic ambitions are alien to civilized and democratic 
Western countries. 
  We would like to tell Greece that, with the blocking of EU 
assistance, it has gone too far and cannot boast of being 
neither an old neighbor nor an EC president. On this occasion 
Greece has used an economic punishment even for the Albanian 
citizens of Greek origin who, determined to set up a democratic 
society in Albania, are not only penalized but are also left 
dissatisfied from this act and feel that others are abusing and 
manipulating them. 
  The spokesman finally stressed that Albania is confident 
that 
the European Union will not agree to the blocking of reforms in 
Albania and that it will not allow the money of noble European 
taxpayers to be used for purposes of destabilized and 
nationalistic policies or to serve geopolitical disequilibrium.

  [Text] The impossibility of the private sector becoming a 
strong enough economic basis to compensate for the destruction 
of the state-owned sector has by now become a concern. For 
Tirana, the population of which has reportedly reached 500,000, 
this problem has become rather pronounced. The figures made 
available to us by the Tariff Office of Tirana Municipality show 
that there are currently 2,322 Albanian companies employing 
9,028 people, 586 foreign companies with 4,109 employees, and 
1,007 joint ventures employing 4,100 people. In Tirana there 
are now 26,000 people employed in the private sector. There are 
also around 6,000 people trading a great variety of products 
from stalls that have sprung up on Tirana's pavements. 
  However, unemployment in Tirana amounts to around 60,000, 
not 
to mention the influx into the capital from other districts, 
which is estimated at 100,000 people. Yet, in this 
overpopulation with a high degree of social wounds, there is a 
lack of a regional development plan. This remains to be done 
perhaps in the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Dan Damian: "Romanian Companies Trade With </F>
Radioactive Material and Armaments From the Former Soviet Union"] 
  [Text] The changes that have taken place in the Romanian 
society after 1989 have enabled the small and large 
entrepreneurs that have emerged in the business world to amass 
capital. The expansion of business links in the wake of the 
opening of the borders of the former socialist camp has led to 
the emergence of a new sale market, where the relationship 
between the sellers and buyers is determined by the offer. 
  Aside from big deals, such as the import of infested sugar 
and corn and of other foodstuffs from the Middle East, a special 
place among the various products currently on offer is taken by 
the trade with arms and radioactive materials. 
<H5>  Armaments and Radioactive Materials Are Delivered From the </H5>
States of the Russian Federation 
  The dismemberment of the former Soviet Union in 1990 has led 
not only to the appearance of new political forces and of new 
concepts about whether to remake "Great Russia" or not, but also 
to the redivision of the huge military arsenal of the former 
USSR. 
  Part of this arsenal -- the nuclear part, which is deployed 
in such areas of the former USSR that were suitable, from a 
geographic viewpoint, for pointing missiles at capitalist 
targets -- are under the control of the Western powers and will 
be dismantled by 1996. The other part of this arsenal, which is 
active, can jeopardize life in Central Europe and throughout the 
world at any moment, not only because of the political 
instability prevailing in the area of the former USSR, but also 
because of the maintenance of various armed conflicts, which can 
generate true nuclear holocausts at any time. 
  In keeping with existing treaties on nonproliferation and 
nuclear disarmament, one portion of the nuclear charges 
resulting from the dismantlement of the nuclear weapons of the 
former USSR is earmarked for peaceful purposes, while the other 
part is meant to be securely destroyed, so as not to endanger 
human life and the environment. 
  Since the quantity of radioactive material resulting from 
the 
destruction of nuclear weapons is very large, a good part of it 
was sold for further use either to countries in the Middle East 
or to other countries currently interested in producing or 
acquiring nuclear weapons. Equally true is the fact that the 
former USSR countries possess mineral resources containing very 
many radioactive elements, such as radium, scandium, osmium, 
plutonium, and other strategic elements used in the manufacture 
of nuclear weapons. 
  The new trade in radioactive materials has attracted people 
from both the former USSR states and from the former Warsaw Pact 
countries, since the profits inherent in this trade are large 
and immediate. 
  Among the Russian companies involved in the sale of 
radioactive substances, we would mention just two: LUCH-3, 
whose owner is Sergey Alekseyevich Pushkin, and LEGION, 
represented by Russian citizen Klynchagov [name as received]. 
<H5>  Romanian Firms Are Involved in the Traffic of Radioactive </H5>
Materials 
  In a short period of time, several people from Romania -- 
including Niculae Costel, representative of several Romanian 
companies such as ROMBEL and SIRCOM, and Elisabeta Ana 
Stefanescu, owner and sole associate of TECHNOTOURS company -- 
have managed to establish contacts with Russian companies from 
the Russian Federation and with various firms in Romania. 
  Under the cover of ROMBEL company, Niculae Costel managed to 
contact several people and representatives of certain foreign 
companies, such as EURONOR BUSINESS PARTNER Ltd., with 
headquarters in Norway, DB FINANZ CONSULTING AG from Germany, or 
DHS MERGER-Alois Geissler, offering to deliver red mercury, 
osmium 192, radium, and scandium in quantities varying between 
15 and 200 kilograms, at a cost price of $73,000 per gram, which 
would be tantamount to a profit of $1 billion. 
  Throughout the 1992-93 period, Niculae Costel made several 
visits to Russia to decide on the ways and means of delivering 
the goods as well as on the amounts of hard currency to be paid 
into various banks. 
<H5>  Codes Are Used for the Transactions of Radioactive Materials </H5>
  The offers of the supplier of the respective commodity were 
sent by fax, with the analysis certificate attached. The 
analysis bulletins also specified the purity of the radioactive 
material and the density of the other component substances. 
  In order to ensure the secrecy of the transaction, the two 
sides used codes. The codes, containing various names such as 
"Sunshine," "Apple," "Stardust," or "Nautilus," were used to 
codify both the transaction and the product. For instance, the 
code "Nautilus" was used to denote osmium 187, while the code 
"red oil" was used for the red mercury-RM 20/20. 
  The letters of intent received from the party interested in 
buying the product always mentioned that the transaction can 
only take place after a sample of the respective material was 
submitted to chemical analyses that would attest to the purity 
and quality of the product. Only analysis certificates in 
accordance with the "Karpov" and "Frieberger" methods are valid 
for such radioactive substances. 

<H5>    The Transport of Red Mercury Samples Is Done With TAROM </H5>
Airplanes 
  Although red mercury is a nonactive substance, its 
characteristics can turn it into a very strong explosive when it 
merges with other chemical substances. As a matter of fact, red 
mercury RM 20/20 is used in the manufacture of the neutron bomb. 
  Using not only her imagination, but also her relations, the 
owner of TECNOTOURS company, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu used the 
Bucharest-Rome TAROM flight of 5 July 1992 -- which landed in 
Rome at 1415 hours local time -- to transport a sample of red 
mercury. 
  The red mercury sample was handed over to the airplane 
captain by Rosca Stanescu, deputy commander of Otopeni Airport. 
In Italy, the "small package" was handed over by the airplane 
captain to Florin Groman, head of the TAROM office in Rome. The 
package was then passed on to another man within the Rome 
Airport by Florin Groman himself, who was ostentatiously 
carrying a sign with the name of the individual supposed to take 
over the package, namely the Italian citizen Egidio Musso. 
  Once the transaction was completed, Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu 
told her Italian business partner, Egidio Musso, to open a 
dollar account for her at the Italian bank Credito Italiano, 
with herself as the only one entitled to withdraw money from 
that account. 
  Using the "Rosso" code for the red mercury, Elisabeta 
Stefanescu informed the Italian company OMNIA TECNO SRL, with 
headquarters in the town of La Spezia, that the "Rosso" sample 
was brought to Romania by an agent of an embassy empowered to 
deal with this affair. In the same message, Elisabeta Stefanescu 
-- who until 1989 had occupied various administrative posts at 
several foreign diplomatic missions in Romania -- expressed the 
fear that she had attracted "too much attention" at home. 
  For the same material, RM 20/20, Elisabeta Stefanescu used 
the code "992/LDEASGC/101-M" in a transaction involving 138 kg 
of red mercury for the MUELLER TREUHAND company of Zurich, 
Switzerland, asking for $340,000 per kilogram. She also made 
clear that the deal was concluded in Moscow with Russian 
partners, with the red mercury procured from the Russian town of 
Chelyabinsk. 
  In the July-December 1992 period, Elisabeta Stefanescu spent 
a "long vacation" in Italy, more precisely in Lerici town, 
staying at the most luxurious hotel in the region. On that 
occasion, she got in touch with the business connections in 
Italy and also established new contacts with people interested 
in purchasing radioactive material. 
  At the end of a prosperous business trip abroad, she 
returned 
home with two boxes full of jewelry, two fur coats, two Mercedes 
220D, a Nissan Patrol cross-country vehicle, and "small gifts" 
for her connections in Romania. In May 1992, Elisabeta 
Stefanescu moved out of her parents' home in Londra Street No. 
25 into a villa (number 45) in Snagov, which she is renting for 
500,000 lei per month. 
<H5>  From the Trade in Red Mercury to the Trade in Military </H5>
Technology 
  TECNOTOURS' business turnover, which in 1992 stood at 2 
billion lei, exceeded 23 billion lei in 1993, but registered 
zero profits??! All this was achieved with only three employees 
and a sole "single associate," Elisabeta Ana Stefanescu. All 
was made possible by expanding the company's sphere of activity 
to include the trade in military technology. 
  By establishing several contacts with the Russian citizen 
Anatoliy Ivanov, general director of the BIISIK [name as 
received] Ltd. company, and with Eduard Hiznicenco, director of 
the COMINET SRL company from Odorheiul Secuiesc, Elisabeta 
Stefanescu began offering the Middle East "market" a whole range 
of products from the Russian armaments industry: from AKM and 
AK-47 machine guns -- each costing $170, with some 3 million 
pieces on offer -- up to MI-26 and MI-35 helicopters, T-72 and 
T-80 tanks, and MiG-29 planes, with the prices varying between 
$19 million and $55 million. 
<H5>  The Use of Coded Messages and Other Codes in Arms </H5>
Transactions 
  Another private entrepreneur involved in the transactions 
with radioactive materials and armaments, Niculae Costel, 
representative of SIRCOM company, contacted the ROMTEHNICA 
company. 
  In a letter marked "confidential" and "ultra confidential," 
Niculae Costel informed Rear Admiral C. Raducanu, deputy chief 
of the Army Supply and Equipment Service, of an impending 
transaction, namely the confidential project "Yacht," whose 
destination was the Great Lakes region in Canada. The customer 
was demanding that the name of the vessel should be kept secret 
and that the Romanian crew should train the foreign crew during 
the voyage. In exchange, the customer was offering, in codified 
terms, "stinger, hot, and patrol" plus "some money." Meanwhile 
we have managed to identify the meaning of "stinger" and "hot," 
which stand for antitank missiles.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene Defense Minister Jelko Kacin by Samo </F>
Kobenter; place and date not given: "Lifting of Embargo Is a 
Must"] 
  [Text] [Kobenter] Defense Minister, how is the 
international arms embargo against the states of the former 
Yugoslavia affecting Slovenia? 
  [Kacin] Our job is to reduce the possibility of military 
conflicts on the territory of Slovenia to a minimum. This is 
only possible if we can also deter an opponent that is superior 
in strength. We would have to invest in the early detection of 
the enemy and in reconnaissance, that is, to buy radar 
facilities and develop our air defense. We will not get this 
equipment unless the embargo is lifted. The embargo is a 
political problem because, as a UN member, we have a duty to 
defend ourselves, but this organization deprives us of the 
opportunity. We are suffering from the embargo against rump 
Yugoslavia, although we are participating in it. Moreover, we 
cannot choose our neighbors. 
  We do not only have borders with states like Austria, but 
also with such as are involved in military conflicts. The 
lifting of the arms embargo is a must for our road to Europe, 
all the more so since Slovenia cannot threaten anyone by its 
size, but will only ensure its security. 
  [Kobenter] What would be the strength of a Slovene Army that 
is fit for military service? 
  [Kacin] It is very limited, we draft about 12,000 recruits 
every year. This number cannot threaten anybody, although our 
army would be stronger in the case of mobilization. (In the war 
of 1991 the territorial defense forces had about 60,000 men -- 
the editors) 
  [Kobenter] Could you imagine a neighbor like Croatia trying 
to solve its differences with Slovene by force of arms? 
  [Kacin] It depends on the parties involved. In 1991 we 
showed that we are very good at our defense tasks and we would 
do it again. However, something completely different is at stake 
for Slovenia: integration with Europe. Any conflict would be a 
step backward. In the next eight years we want to invest 1 
billion German marks in securing our airspace. 
  [Kobenter] Also in aircraft? 
  [Kacin] Yes. Twelve aircraft should be enough for us. But 
radar facilities and defensive systems should also be procured. 
  [Kobenter] ...which could also be bought on the black 
market. 
  [Kacin] No, by no means. First of all, we are only 
interested in the legal way of procurement because we consider 
ourselves a member of the international community of states. 
Second, you cannot buy aircraft on the black market. And, in 
view of the small amounts and our defense needs, the objections 
that our arms might turn up on the theater of war are an 
illusion. 
  [Kobenter] As a conclusion, you would also have to oppose 
the lifting of the embargo against Bosnia and Croatia. 
  [Kacin] As defense minister, I can only speak for Slovenia. 
I would welcome it if one of the states that developed from 
Yugoslavia's disintegration and whose name I do not want to 
mention were to sign the "Partnership for Peace" agreement. 
This would be a security guarantee. 
  [Kobenter] Are you also planning accession to the military 
alliance of the European Union [EU] in the long run? 
  [Kacin] It depends on the future restructuring of NATO and 
the Western European Union. If you look at Slovenia from 
Europe, you get a completely different view from the one you get 
if you look at it from the United States through the prism of 
Moscow. We have not set out on the road to Europe to persist in 
self-restraint like Albania. We want to develop more quickly 
and live better. 
  [Kobenter] What could future cooperation with Austria be 
like, also in view of Austria's efforts for entry into the EU? 
  [Kacin] We signed a cooperation treaty a year ago. Our 
soldiers participate in joint military competitions and we 
benefit from the exchange of experience. Later, we will also be 
able to talk about joint maneuvers.

<F P=106> [Article by Milica Knezevic] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia's economic 
recovery programme will be put to the acid test after July 24, 
when the National Bank of Yugoslavia (central bank) stops 
financing the state budget deficit. "The politicians have been 
told clearly that the state's fiscal deficit will no longer be 
made up from the central bank coffers. Let them take out loans 
on the capital market," says Dragoslav Avramovic, central bank 
governor and architect of the national economic stabilisation 
programme. 
  Measures which the federal government began implementing on 
January 24 have helped avert an economic and monetary collapse 
in conditions of a tight international blockade of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro). Avramovic explains that the programme began 
with consolidating the national currency and should end with 
balancing the budgetary revenues and outlays. Serbia's deficit 
is down to 45 percent of the plan, and the federal deficit, to 
75 percent. 
  Late last week, the Serbian Government said it had taken 
measures to ensure the financing of the total public 
expenditures from real sources, without incurring a budget 
deficit. Similar measures are being planned by the Montenegrin 
Government, according to competent authorities. The ball is now 
in the court of the Federal Government, which should balance its 
books by July 24, after which date all budgetary outlays will 
have to be covered from real earnings. In case of need, the 
state will be able to take out credits but only on the market, 
through issuing debentures, central bank experts explain. 
  Avramovic said on Saturday he would resign as governor of 
the 
central bank the moment he had to print money without gold and 
hard currency backing. 
  The new dinar, which has full gold and hard currency 
backing, 
was circulated on January 24 to replace the old dinar which had 
been devalued out of existence by an annual inflation of 116 
billion percent in 1993. Analysts say that, if he manages to 
implement his plan and put an end to the practice of 50 years of 
financing the budget deficit by printing money, Avramovic will 
create conditions for a lasting elimination of the chief 
generator of inflation.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Kuna Also in Serbia"] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb (HINA) -- As Radio Belgrade reported in its 
program dedicated to economic issues, Governor of "the National 
Bank of Yugoslavia" Dragoslav Avramovic has announced "a better 
economic and more open financial cooperation of the majority of 
Balkan states." Taking part in TANJUG's guest public tribune in 
Belgrade, Avramovic spoke of his recent visit in the United 
States and participation the conference on banking and business 
cooperation in Athens and said: "We have agreed on ways to 
trade with securities and interest was displayed in this sense 
for Croatia also to take part in the cooperation program that 
has already been agreed. Although there is resistance in 
Belgrade for allegedly ideological reasons, it is a long-term 
interest of our country to facilitate payment, purchase, and 
access to all West European currencies and thus also to the 
Croatian currency, regardless of what it is called. Any banker 
will tell you that money knows no borders, and any governor, if 
he is any good, can prove this.... 
  "There are many practical reasons for which Investbanka will 
facilitate the exchange of kunas for dinars. If people receive 
pensions in kunas then we must make it easier for these people, 
with a realistic exchange rate based on the relation to the 
German mark, to purchase goods in Serbia...." said the other 
participant at TANJUG's tribune Stojan Dabic, director general 
of Investbanka and the chairman of the federal securities' 
commission.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Bisenic: "Let Milosevic Assume Responsibility </F>
for Yugoslavia"] 
  [Text] A discussion on how the federal state is functioning 
should be held immediately, at an extraordinary session of the 
Federal Assembly. This has been suggested by Zoran Djindjic, 
president of the Democratic Party, explaining for BORBA the 
initiative according to which the top posts in that state ought 
to be held by the "most important people," while the state ought 
to become a federation in the real sense of the word. 
  "At this session, the government, which is only a `feather 
among whirlwinds,' should be voted out. It is necessary, 
without shrinking from it, to raise the question of the post of 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] President [Zoran] Lilic and 
establish what his role is, since he is only a political mask," 
Djindjic said. 
  According to Djindjic, this discussion should be held in the 
Federal Assembly among the parliamentary parties. They should 
establish whether there is a consensus on this and what the 
contentions issue are. "We already have two years of 
experience. This debate should be followed by federal elections 
at which the citizens would vote for a concept that the parties 
that win the majority of votes must put into practice. The 
citizens are now being deceived because they voted for a federal 
state, but, in essence, only got an illusory federal state," the 
leader of the Democratic Party said. 
  It is high time, Djindjic said, that the Socialist Party of 
Serbia explain its views on Yugoslavia, because the comedy of 
the federal state may be funny, but the consequences are tragic. 
Judged according to their importance, [President] Lilic, [Prime 
Minister Radoje] Kontic, Bozovic [chairman of the Chamber of 
Citizens], and Radulovic [chairman of the Chamber of Republics], 
as the four top officials of the state, cannot even be 
considered second-rate politicians. We demand that the ruling 
parties and these people say whether they really want a federal 
state, or whether they need it only as a front for the 
republican states. If they want the former, then they should 
find different persons for these posts. If they want the 
latter, then this is too expensive for the people. The crisis 
in the federal parliament is the right opportunity to find an 
answer to these issues. We as a party hold the view that the 
top posts in the top organs in a modern federal state should be 
held by the most influential politicians of Serbia and 
Montenegro. I do not see any reason why [Serbian President 
Slobodan] Milosevic should not assume responsibility for 
Yugoslavia, why [Montenegrin President Momir] Bulatovic should 
not be prime minister, why Djukanovic [Montenegrin prime 
minister and defense minister] should not be finance minister, 
why Marovic should not be chairman of the Chamber of Republics, 
and so forth. 
  Neither Bozovic, nor Sainovic, nor the other spent officials 
that were put on this sidetrack called the federal state have 
any influence on internal or foreign policy. Those who are 
indeed in charge of the policies should be in the posts from 
which they can do it legally, Djindjic said. Djindjic also said 
that one should discard the confederal elements and create a 
clear decisionmaking pyramid. These top posts should be filled 
with respectable politicians. 
  The Democratic Party proposed this initiative to other 
parties at the recent interparties meetings. 
  If the ruling parties reply negatively to this initiative, 
Djindjic said that this would be a kind of answer that is only 
prolonging this deception, torturing people, and discrediting 
the very idea of the state.

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Rakitic, 
head of the Depos [Democratic Movement of Serbia] deputies group 
in the Citizens Chamber of the Federal Assembly, told 
journalists today that a group of 11 Depos deputies are forming 
a political party that will retain the name of this movement but 
will operate independently. 
  The Democratic Movement of Serbia expelled from its ranks 11 
Depos deputies in the Federal Assembly's Chamber of Citizens 
after the last elections. However, on the basis of legal 
regulations, up to now they have retained their mandates as 
deputies. 
  The nucleus of the new party, its "interim president" 
Rakitic 
said, is at this moment made up of 11 Depos deputies in the 
Citizens Chamber, coalition deputies from the previous Serbian 
Assembly, distinguished members of the Main Committee of the 
Serbian Renewal Movement that are no longer in this party, as 
well as numerous nonparty people. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Protic] </F>
  [Text] The deputies of the former Depos [Democratic 
Movement of Serbia] coalition in the Chamber of Citizens of the 
Federal Assembly, led by Slobodan Rakitic, and former deputies 
in the republican assembly and prominent deputies who are no 
longer in the Serbian Renewal Movement, constitute the core of 
the new Depos party. They have chosen this name because they 
are obliged to do so according to electoral law. Speaking about 
the policies of the new party at a news conference in the 
federal assembly today, Slobodan Rakitic, stated that they are a 
democratic party whose program is based on Christian 
civilization. Stressing that the opposition has up to now been 
mainly saying what it does not want, rather than what it does, 
Rakitic said that the party supports everything that is good for 
the Serbian people. 
  [Begin Rakitic recording] Morality, traditional values, 
understanding, and tolerance that the Serbian people possess in 
their collective being should be the main program tenets of the 
reformed Depos. [end recording] 
  Presidency member Strahinja Kastratovic said that the time 
of boisterous parties, yelling, and outbursts of hatred is over, 
and that the new Depos favors a peaceful approach and 
cooperation with all political parties. Kastratovic stressed in 
particular that one should do everything possible to help the 
stabilization program and that the party supports Avramovic's 
program. The survival of the program is the precondition for the 
stability of the parliament. According to Kastratovic, this 
means that one should not insist on new elections but support 
the efforts of the federal and republican governments. 
  Regarding Depos' stand on peace in Bosnia, Kastratovic said 
that the interests of the Serbian people must be protected, as 
must international relations, taking into account the interests 
of the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serbian Krajina 
while not endangering the interests of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Pristina, June 3 (TANJUG) -- Vice-premier of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) Nikola Sainovic said on 
Friday that the F.R.Y. basic policy of peace, security and 
economic revival was being administered despite hardships, 
sanctions and war encirclement. In a talk with managers of the 
biggest enterprises in Pristina, centre of the southern Serbian 
province of Kosovo and Metohija, Sainovic emphasized that the 
Yugoslav economic program differed from those in other countries 
which have similar economic problems because it enables strong 
resistance to sanctions and economic pressures and essentially 
defends the country's economic independence. 
  Basically, said Sainovic, this model program means reliance 
upon one's own potential, and this holds good for the country as 
a whole and for the level of enterprises. The exit from the 
crisis, said he, is the same for the big business systems as 
well as small-sized enterprises. The two-year-old U.N.-imposed 
sanctions on Yugoslavia cannot be an excuse for any one within 
the economy any longer, because adequate solutions to such 
problems should have been found in the meantime, said Sainovic. 
  The program of reinvigoration of the Yugoslav economy, 
enforced early January, relies upon a restrictive monetary 
policy, a reform of the taxation system, amd the elimination of 
huge budgetary deficits. Sainovic said it was necessary to 
change an old habit of giving "special discounts" to the less 
developed regions and to certain public enterprises. 
  There are no such discounts any longer, but what has to be 
done is to work together and to jointly seek solutions to the 
problems, through assistance extended by other enterprises, said 
Sainovic in stressing that his present talks in Pristina 
entirely differed from the way talks were held in the past when 
this province had only been demanding aid from the federal 
budget. 
  Kosovo and Metohija, a region with abundant natural 
resources, in the former Yugoslavia had been heavily subsidised 
(as the least developed region with the highest unemployment 
rate) from the special fund for the country's less developed 
regions.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 4 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of 
the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Goran Percevic, said 
on Saturday that SPS is willing to open a dialogue with the 
representatives of ethnic Albanian parties from Serbia's Kosovo 
province on condition that they recognize the integrity of 
Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Even our most bitter enemies in the world and the fiercest 
opponents of the Serbian national interests do not question 
Yugoslavia's integrity and the Albanian alternative should be 
aware that this issue is not negotiable, Percevic told the radio 
of Jagodina, town in central Serbia. 
  A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades 
been active in Kosovo. The separatists have illegally 
proclaimed the `Kosovo Republic' and advocate its secession from 
Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation with neighbouring Albania. 
  Underscoring that the offer for a dialogue has remained open 
for some time, but that the ethnic Albanian parties are 
rejecting it, Percevic said that in the end they will have to 
accept it because they are also becoming aware that `their aim 
-- an independent Republic of Kosovo -- cannot be realized.' 
  British minister of state at the Foreign Office, Douglas 
Hogg, who was recently in Kosovo, also told the ethnic 
Albanians, national minority in Serbia and Yugoslavia, that they 
cannot count on their own state. 
  We had political contacts with some political parties from 
Albania but not with ethnic Albanian parties in Serbia which 
rally most members of this minority, simply because they refuse 
a dialogue with the legal Serbian and Yugoslav authorities, 
Percevic said. 
  Commenting persecution claims by ethnic Albanians, Percevic 
said that the `representatives of the Albanian minority are 
intentionally boycotting the rights they have been granted by 
this country's consititution with the aim of convincing the 
world to the contrary.'

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Robert Tamchyna in </F>
Prague on 3 June; from the weekly "Conversations at Lany" 
program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Tamchyna] Today I naturally have to open our 
interview with a question about a visit to the Czech Republic by 
Chilean General Augusto Pinochet. Our leading politicians have 
dissociated themselves from his visit. However, I have to admit 
that I perceive their repeated assurances that they have nothing 
to do with his visit as proof of their embarrassment and an 
attempt to shake off a certain share of responsibility. 
  [Havel] I do not think I am trying to shake off any share of 
responsibility. I am not the one who issues visas; I have not 
issued a visa for him. I have simply learned from newspapers 
that Mr. Pinochet is here. 
  He is not a man to my liking. He is simply the man who 
organized a putsch against a democratically elected government. 
On one hand, his name is linked to an economic miracle, but he 
is also linked to much cruelty and rages by secret police. This 
man is not to my liking. I have simply acknowledged that he has 
made a visit here, as on occasions a number of people I do not 
like will probably do. [passage omitted] 
  In this context I would like to say one more thing. I am an 
essentially nonideological or anti-ideological person. I do not 
think people should be assessed according to on which side of 
the barricade they are said to be standing. It has always made 
me angry to hear Communists saying that Stalin stood on the 
right side of the barricade, that he fought for a better world, 
and that he just made some small mistakes. It is the same when 
somebody says nowadays that Mr. Pinochet stood on the right side 
of the barricade and that he just made some small mistakes in 
the form of murdering and persecuting people. This is an 
ideological vision of the world that can, step by step, totally 
detach itself from the basic humanistic assessment of actions, 
from the basic respect for a state ruled by the law. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "(ina)": "Nechanicky in Charge of Interior </F>
Ministry's Inspectorate"] 
  [Text] Prague--[Interior] Minister Jan Ruml yesterday 
appointed Vladimir Nechanicky, a former prosecutor with the CSFR 
Prosecutor General's Office, the new director of the Interior 
Ministry Inspectorate, which investigates misdemeanors committed 
by police officers. 
  Nechanicky, who represented Otakar Kracik, one of the 
accused 
in the rum affair, is the fourth head of the Inspectorate in the 
almost two years that Ruml has managed the department. The 
Ministry's spokesman, Jan Subrt, justified the personnel changes 
by saying that the Inspectorate is returning to Ruml's 
management and will no longer be the responsibility of his 
deputy, Jiri Krizan. Krizan, however, will continue to manage 
the supervisory team that looks into the misdemeanors committed 
by the department's civilian personnel.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslava Ciznerova for the Czech Statistical </F>
Office: "Better Use for Our Products--1993 Results Seen in the 
Light of the Newly Introduced Selective Index of Import and 
Export Prices--The Index Includes 1,795 Items"] 
  [Text] The first results of Czech foreign trade last year 
showed a decline in average prices (values) of imported types of 
goods and, on the other hand, showed growing prices of exports 
involving domestic production. These findings regarding the 
development of average prices are based on data contained in 
customs statistics and capture not only price developments, but 
also changes in the quality structure of the assortment of goods 
involved. 
  The Czech Statistical Office, therefore, introduced a 
selective price index for foreign trade, on the basis of 
standard selection methods of price statistics, in which the 
influences of these changes are excluded to the maximum possible 
extent. 
<H5>  Simpler Conditions </H5>
  The price indexes for imports and exports make it possible 
to 
monitor pure price movements, the development of exchange 
relationships, and the impact of price developments upon the 
development of imports, exports, and the balance of trade. Price 
indexes of this type are available only in some countries and 
the Czech Statistical Office is thus similar to indexes that 
were worked out during the 1970's and 1980's, but under totally 
different -- essentially simpler -- conditions resulting from 
the monopolization of foreign trade. 
  The schematic of the selective index for import and export 
prices was designed during 1993 in accordance with the 
standardized system (of the customs duty rate table). In so 
doing, use was made of exhaustive data provided by customs 
statistics and a one-time unique selective investigation, which 
was carried out involving enterprises, joint-stock corporations, 
and corporations with limited liability which were of importance 
to Czech Republic foreign trade. Some 998 export items and 797 
import items, including products, raw materials, and materials 
which occupy a significant share in the overall volume of 
foreign trade and regarding which it is anticipated that they 
will be long-term objects of foreign trade activities, were 
included in the index. The selection is expected to undergo 
minimum changes in order to be able to show actual price 
developments in foreign trade. 
<H5>  Quarterly Determinations </H5>
  Prices are determined on a quarterly basis and reflect 
commercial parities and prices quoted as "all charges prepaid to 
border" of the Czech Republic for imports and prices quoted as 
"all charges prepaid to border" for Czech Republic exports. They 
are recomputed in terms of appropriate monetary exchange rates 
and do not contain value-added tax, nor consumer tax. But the 
price indexes do include the influence of changes in foreign 
exchange rates and the influence of changes in the composition 
of foreign markets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


  Those who did the indexes are aware of the fact that a 
selective index monitors net price movements only based on a 
limited representative quantity of selective products, whereas 
the index of average values captures the broader region of 
commercial commodities; however, the index fully meets the 
monitored goals. As can be seen from the data in the table, 
there are no significant differences between the index results 
for 1993. 
<H5>  Results of the Investigation </H5>
  From the indexes acquired, it is clear that price 
developments in 1993 were moving toward lower prices for 
imports; compared with 1992, prices declined by 0.3 percent; and 
there were mainly opposite trends in terms of exports, where 
prices rose by 4 percent, which is proof of the better assertion 
of Czech exports in foreign markets. 
  The investigation showed that, in 1993 imports, prices of 
mineral fuels specifically declined by 10.3 percent. This was 
mostly accounted for by oil, which is one of the most important 
raw materials in this group. The surplus in the amount of oil 
offered on world markets signaled a decline in petroleum prices 
last year. Also, prices of animal and plant oils declined by 
11.5 percent; the price decline in chemicals was more modest at 
4.4 percent; foodstuffs and live animal prices declined by 3.3 
percent. On the other hand, the prices of various industrial 
products rose by 8.7 percent; those of raw materials, with the 
exception of fuels, rose by 4.7 percent, and prices of machinery 
and transportation devices rose by 3.5 percent. 
  On the other hand, in exports, the prices of various 
industrial products rose by 16.1 percent, those of foodstuffs by 
10.9 percent, and those of machinery and transportation devices 
by 8 percent. But even here there was a decline--raw materials 
prices declined by 12.3 percent, prices of chemical industry 
products declined by 7.2 percent, and prices of mineral fuels 
declined by 4.8 percent. 
  In terms of current prices, the balance of trade ended up 
with a surplus of approximately 5 billion korunas [Kc]. Given an 
unchanged price level, in other words, in comparable prices for 
1992, last year's foreign trade activities ended up on the down 
side with a deficit of approximately Kc9 billion. The interyear 
development of price relationships thus resulted in 1993 
revenues of virtually Kc15 billion.

    [Editorial Report] A recent visit by Prime Minister Vaclav 
Klaus to major Latin American countries emphasized the continued 
efforts by the Czech Government to expand the republic's 
exports. Economics Minister Karel Dyba also promoted trade links 
during his late April visit to Taiwan. 
<H5>  Latin America Trip </H5>
  According to the 27 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, 
Klaus's visit, which included a large delegation of businessmen, 
confirmed the growing Czech interest in Latin America. As Klaus 
explained, "In this market we are achieving the highest sales in 
value-added products; three times more machinery and machine 
tools are going to South America than to industrially developed 
countries." 
  Milos Sklenka, a HOSPODARSKE NOVINY correspondent who 
accompanied the delegation, said that Klaus's tour of Latin 
America, as well as his visit to Mexico last year, demonstrated 
that the rapidly developing markets on the Latin subcontinent 
could be very advantageous to the Czech Republic. Sklenka noted 
that during Klaus's stay in Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile, and 
Brasilia, he proposed removing tariff and nontariff restrictions 
and increasing mutual trade, eventually leading to the 
establishment of a free trade zone. 
  Sklenka also reported on the Latin American hosts' reaction 
to the visit, pointing out that there was substantial interest 
in the Czech model of privatization and macroeconomic policy. 
Argentina appeared to be particularly enthusiastic about the 
proposal, asserting that it could be implemented within three 
years. Chile's response was relatively reserved, although 
Chilean leaders did not reject the proposals altogether. Brazil, 
meanwhile, appeared to be pressing for more regional trade 
liberalization. 
  According to Sklenka's report, Klaus's talks with the 
Argentine President Carlos Menem and Economic Minister D. 
Cavallo concluded with a memorandum of understanding between the 
two countries on preparing an agreement for a future free trade 
zone. The participants in the meeting expressed hope that it 
will eventually lead to free trade between Central European 
markets and the South American Mercosure (Argentina, Brazil, 
Uruguay, and Paraguay). New agreements are to be concluded on 
investment support and guarantees, dual taxation, and visa-less 
diplomatic travel. In the 22 April issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, 
Sklenka published an interview with Cavallo, who said that 
"while Argentina should become a gateway for Czech products to 
South America, we would like the Czech Republic to become a 
catalyst for the expansion of Argentine trade in Central and 
Eastern Europe." 
  In Chile, Sklenka reported, Klaus led the negotiations with 
President Eduardo Frei and Finance Minister Eduardo Aninate on 
greater trade liberalization between the two countries. During 
the last year, Czech exports to Chile ($5.6 million), which were 
three times higher than imports, consisted mainly of iron and 
steel, tractors, trucks, and textiles. Meanwhile, Chile exported 
to the Czech Republic mainly fruit and vegetables, but also some 
cotton, raw materials, and cattle feed. This trade had come to a 
virtual halt during the Pinochet government from 1973 to 1990. 
<H5>  Taiwan Trip </H5>
  Karel Dyba was accompanied to Taiwan by the president of the 
Industrial and Transportation Chamber, Stepan Popovich, and 
several industrial representatives. According to the 25 April 
issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Czech "industry captains" spent 
five days negotiating trade relations with the Taiwanese 
semigovernmental organization CENTRA, which provides assistance 
to Taiwanese foreign trade. It is expected that a text of an 
agreement with the Taiwanese CNFT (Chinese National Federation 
of Industry) would be approved. The agreement is to cover 
information exchange, support of business exchanges, mutual 
trade stimulation, and production cooperation. The Chamber vice 
president, Pavel Prior, stressed to the Chinese the advantages 
of investing in the Czech Republic and expressed hope that the 
Taiwanese would help them penetrate the Asian markets. 
  In the same issue of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Pavel Prior noted 
that competition in Asia is very keen. The Czechs recently lost 
a bid to build a metro for the Japanese, and apparently the 
Taiwanese expect better banking terms than the CSOB [Czech 
National Bank] seemed to be willing to offer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Economics Minister Stanislav Zalud by </F>
Marek Stonis; place and date not given: "Regional Policy Can Be 
Implemented Even Without Subsidies"] 
  [Text] It has become increasingly clear recently that 
some regions of the Czech Republic have greater economic 
problems than others. This is the result of many factors--their 
geographic position, a predominance of inefficient industry, 
etc. We discussed the method by which the Ministry of Economics 
is dealing with this fact with Stanislav Zalud, deputy economics 
minister (ODS [Civic Democratic Party]). 
  [Stonis] At the Ministry of Economics, you are responsible 
for the so-called development of regional activities in the 
Czech Republic. How can those activities be fulfilled without 
resulting in significant drawdowns of resources from the state 
budget? 
  [Zalud] The best way to realize regional policy is to 
support 
individual regional projects. It is not a matter of thinking up 
something in Prague--the regions themselves must decide 
regarding the speed and quality of realization of individual 
activities. A whole series of support systems exist--support for 
activities, for ideas, for programs or connecting various 
related matters. I frequently hear the question asked how we can 
implement regional policy when we have no means at our disposal 
for it in the budget. One can also achieve regional policy by 
proving capable of implementing it even on the basis of other 
resources. I do not require any of my own resources to initiate 
what I am trying to do. The value of the individual projects 
that are beginning to be realized in the individual regions lies 
in the fact that they are related. In that case, the expending 
of resources is efficient. 
  [Stonis] Can you be specific? 
  [Zalud] First of all, our ministry has established the 
Czech-Moravian Development and Guarantee Bank, which does not 
provide funds directly to entrepreneurs, but provides guarantees 
for individual projects. Furthermore, we are offering a broad 
pallet of programs supported by domestic or foreign resources. 
Of course, the efforts are joined by finances resulting from 
such programs as PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland 
and Hungary], Overtura, Ecos, and HGP [expansion unknown]. I 
consider it to be a success that the PHARE program has changed 
and will no longer mean only technical assistance, as has been 
the case thus far. Finally, for the first time, it is joining in 
with massive utilization of its resources for individual 
investments. We had lacked that thus far. The regions will be 
helped the most if an adequate technical infrastructure exists 
there--communications, energy network, etc. If this 
infrastructure will function, then entrepreneurs will also 
become active in the regions. Of course, a potential 
entrepreneur frequently comes to find out that if he wants to 
start a business and employ people he must, for example, first 
build a wastewater purification capacity and this results in 
financial ruin for him even before he opens his business. For 
us, for the time being, this frequently represents an 
insurmountable handicap. 
  [Stonis] Some political parties have recently drawn 
attention 
to the fact that the Czech Republic is beginning to break down 
into a rich Bohemia and a poor Moravia. Are they correct? 
  [Zalud] It is true everywhere in the world that the 
opportunities at the disposal of individual regions are not 
equal. This is given by the geographic situation, by the 
physical conditions, by the climate, etc. In this context, these 
are not new theses in any way. One of the tasks of regional 
policy is to balance these great differences. But not by 
expending great resources in individual regions which might 
disappear there like in a black hole. We are attempting to 
balance the chances at the disposal of regions, but not by the 
across-the-board use of subsidies. 
  [Stonis] Are there then actually some regions in Moravia 
which are actually poorer than regions in Bohemia? 
  [Zalud] I believe that it continues to be a matter of some 
kind of unresolved injustice, which is not always objective. I 
believe that Moravia has the means of being economically as 
successful as Bohemia. I anticipate, moreover, that it could 
show more self-awareness and develop greater activity. I 
frequently remind investors that, from the business standpoint, 
there are other towns than the city of Prague which are 
attractive. For example, Ostrava: I do not believe that it is 
only black, but that it is attractive from the business 
standpoint in many respects and has many opportunities, even 
when it comes to tourism. 
  [Stonis] Of course, some regions--for example, in the 
okreses 
of Znojmo, Bruntal, or Novy Jicin--unemployment continues to be 
relatively high. Do you believe that these regions have the same 
opportunity to be economically successful? 
  [Zalud] These regions are the subjects of extraordinary 
attention. Because they suffer from long-term and persistently 
higher unemployment than exists elsewhere, the state has 
invested certain resources in these areas. Now, it is only a 
matter of these resources being correctly utilized. It is 
important for okres offices, in collaboration with labor 
offices, to select those most advantageous steps. One can 
polemicize as to whether they have adequate resources for this 
or not. But these are resources which the state was able to 
release on an immediate basis. 
  [Stonis] Nevertheless, is this regional unemployment 
dramatic 
or not from your standpoint? 
  [Zalud] It is not. Together with the Ministry of Labor and 
Social Affairs, we have worked out some common material in which 
we have dealt in detail with unemployment in these regions. Last 
week, we had a basic meeting on redistribution of additional 
resources and unemployment in these regions has, in the 
meantime, quietly and imperceptibly declined. I want to say that 
the numbers are highly mobile and in no way dramatic. Just the 
mere input of a certain amount of resources, which would, in a 
certain way, solve transportation access to some locations, is 
contributing to an immediate improvement in the situation. 
  [Stonis] Your name is coming up in conjunction with the 
privatization of the former military area of Mlada-Ralsko. The 
press continues to carry occasional polemics as to whether the 
decision on utilizing this territory is correct. Do you believe 
that the dispute regarding this military area has definitively 
come to an end? 
  [Zalud] Privatization has definitively been decided on by 
government resolution. It is true that there is always someone 
in the press who is trying to create the impression that there 
is yet another method by which privatization could be 
accomplished. Perhaps he simply forgot the fact that the 
decision has already been made. But these are matters with which 
we are familiar. This happens with all large investment 
decisions--for example, regarding the building of a highway. 
They are long the subject of polemics and then a decision is 
made, the highway is traveled for six years and arguments 
continue to be heard regarding the fact that it could have taken 
another route. Regarding the military area of Ralsko-Mlada, this 
looks to me like the same problem. 
  [Stonis] What specifically will happen in this area in the 
immediate future? 
  [Zalud] In view of the fact that preparation of the actual 
privatization process, in harmony with the given procedures, 
requires a certain amount of time, the government approved the 
proposal made by our minister on 17 November 1993, with the 
exception of approving Resolution No. 404/1993, calling for the 
transfer of property to the city of Benatky nad Jizerou, Straz 
pod Ralskem, Vsejany, and Mukarov. A similar proposal, whose 
scope is essential to assure the continuing functioning of the 
community, has been worked out for the community of Ralsko. The 
actual procedure for transferring property within the areas of 
Ralsko and Mlada is realized on the basis of a schedule of tasks 
approved by the government on 22 December of last year. 
Preparation for actual privatization is being handled by the 
Privum budgetary organization, established by the Ministry of 
Economics. The initial proposals for part of the property in the 
area of Mlada have already been worked out and turned over for 
public announcement. Part of the privatization project in the 
above-listed areas also involves property operated by the Prague 
Military Forests and Farms, state enterprise, the predominant 
portion of which was already published on 8 April. 
  An essential condition regarding the territory of former 
military areas is the working out of the appropriate territorial 
planning documentation. The territory of Dobra Voda was handled 
within the framework of the territorial region of the Sumava. 
The territorial plans for Ralsko and Mlada have been worked out 
and have been discussed--currently preparations for their 
approval are under way.

closing speech, he said among other things that the party would 
have to maintain its current profile; the MSZP should remain a 
people's party, the party of Aunt Mary and Uncle Joe. 
  The congress unanimously decided to call on the SZDSZ 
[Alliance of Free Democrats] to start coalition negotiations 
with them. The letter containing this request has already been 
sent to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe. [passage omitted] The letter 
also states that the similarities of the programs of the two 
parties offer favorable conditions for the establishment of the 
coalition. The letter contains those subjects which the MSZP 
would wish to negotiate; they would assess the economic 
situation, negotiate the strengthening of democratic 
institutions, discuss the urgent measures of the new government, 
talk about the personnel composition of the government and its 
mode of operation, and discuss political and legal guarantees. 
Gyula Horn announced that they were ready for a compromise on 
all the essential issues. 
  The delegates, in their contributions earlier, called on the 
party and the party chairman to show greater tolerance and 
readiness to compromise. Gyula Horn too agreed with this. As 
he said: We cry and laugh together, we take the rap together, 
comrades. 
  Should the MSZP receive a favorable reply from the SZDSZ, 
coalition negotiations could begin at the start of next week.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by unidentified correspondent in Budapest on 4 June; from 
the "The Week" program -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] held an emergency congress. [passage omitted] We 
interviewed Gyula Horn, the party's candidate for prime minister. 
  [Horn] The important thing for me is that the MSZP is 
primarily the party of those living off their labor. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] If we look at the 209 deputies who got into 
parliament under MSZP colors, almost 90 percent of them are 
former members of the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party [MSZMP]. 
  [Horn] This is the first time I have heard the figures in 
this light. To the best of my knowledge about half of the 209 
newly elected deputies were members of the MSZMP, although I 
would not swear to it. [passage omitted] 
  How can you draw a parallel between this party and the old 
nomenclature, when the vast majority of our deputies are in the 
30- to 40-year-old age group? Even if they wanted to, they could 
not have filled any leading positions in the MSZMP. This kind 
of issue is not worth bothering about. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] What will happen if there is no coalition? 
  [Horn] It is not an impossibility. The MSZP received support 
from 54 percent of Hungarian society, so it is obvious we will 
use it. [passage omitted] 
  What is not clear is the new government's freedom of action. 
We do not know about the obligations made by the previous 
government. Prime Minister Peter Boross told me at our latest 
consultation that financial obligations pledged by the 
government regarding various transactions amount to some 200 
billion forints. I suppose he was informed thus by the Finance 
Ministry. However, according to my information, very tough 
obligations amounting to several hundreds of billions forints 
will put pressure on the new government. And what can it do? 
It has to take on the obligations previously undertaken by the 
government. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] At one of the lastest rallies you said that 
the PESTI HIRLAP and UJ MAGYARORSZAG, which at the moment can 
still be considered as government papers, will be closed down. 
A report said this morning that the PESTI HIRLAP will not 
appear next Monday and the editor in chief of the paper was 
dismissed during the week. What is your view on this? 
  [Horn] I find it very strange that while almost all of the 
written press has been privatized, a few papers enjoy support to 
the tune of several tens of millions forints so that they can 
follow a certain political line. No one can accuse PESTI HIRLAP 
or UJ MAGYARORSZAG of criticizing the outgoing government and 
praising the opposition. They worked along a rather one-sided 
political line. 
  [Correspondent] Will there be an opposition paper? 
  [Horn] [passage omitted] To my mind, real journalism can 
only 
take the form of opposition. I do not know of any serious, 
quality government-party journalism existing in the world, 
excerpt perhaps in dictatorships.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Hungarian Socialist Party </F>
Chairman President Gyula Horn by unidentified correspondent on 4 
June; place not given; from the "Newsreel" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] After delivering the closing speech, Gyula Horn gave 
an exclusive interview to Newsreel. The first question was 
whether the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] will be taken 
into consideration as a coalition partner. 
  [Correspondent] It was mentioned that the Fidesz might be 
invited in the coalition. 
  [Horn] Such a concrete proposal was not brought up at the 
congress. However, during our earlier deliberations it was 
brought up. So the raising of this question is not unfounded. 
But, in the end, the congress decided that we would put forward 
a concrete coalition proposal only to the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ]. Thus, on the basis of the congress's 
unequivocal decision, I sent a letter to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan 
Petoe about the coalition proposal this afternoon. 
  [Correspondent] How many and which ministries does the MSZP 
[Hungarian Socialist Party] insist on? 
  [Horn] This was not brought up at the congress since it gave 
a free hand, a full authorization, to the negotiating delegation 
in every issue of this kind. We have an eight-person 
negotiating delegation and I am the leader of it. We think that 
there is a possibility--at least if the creation of the 
coalition depends on this delegation--of reaching an agreement. 
  I can imagine an arrangement that--going somewhat beyond the 
election results--gives a greater opportunity for the SZDSZ 
concerning their participation in the government, than their 
election results will entitle them to. 
  Among the topics to be discussed--providing the SZDSZ gives 
a 
positive reply--the future government's structure has to be 
discussed by all means. For example, whether there should be 
deputy prime ministers, whether certain ministries should be 
merged or whether it is necessary, and which offices, state 
institutions, or ministries should be abolished. Well, I do not 
think it would be normal or correct for a party that puts 
forward a coalition proposal to decide all this beforehand. 
  As the congress spelled out, the MSZP insists on Laszlo 
Bekesi having a determinative role in the next government's 
economic policy. 
  There is a great need for a readiness to make compromises 
and 
reach agreements. This does not only apply to the possible 
coalition partner, the SZDSZ; I would like relations to develop 
between the next parliament's governing and opposition parties, 
which would facilitate the reaching of agreements in a lot of 
issues that are common causes. There are a great number of such 
issues.

  [Text] The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] has received 
an invitation from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] to begin 
coalition negotiations. The SZDSZ leaders may receive 
authorization at tomorrow's party convention to begin 
negotiations. Judit Laszlo reports on today's National Council 
session. 
  [Laszlo] The SZDSZ National Council has accepted the 
executive's proposal that tomorrow's convention should give 
authorization to begin coalition negotiations, said SZDSZ 
Chairman Ivan Petoe. However, the delegation--that consists of 
Ivan Petoe, Gabor Kuncze, Peter Hack, and Balint Magyar--can 
only sign a coalition agreement if it receives guarantees that 
on the one hand, the SZDSZ can substantively influence the 
government's policies, which are to be worked out jointly, and 
on the other, it can implement its 25-point coalition guidelines 
to an appropriate degree. 
  In line with previous plans, a subsequent convention will 
decide on the draft of the coalition pact--on its acceptance or 
refusal. The SZDSZ's Executive and National Council request 
authorization from tomorrow's extraordinary convention to begin 
the coalition talks because the trust that the voters put in the 
party obliges the party to do so, said Ivan Petoe, giving a 
reason for the decision. He also said that in accordance with 
the liberal parties cooperation agreement, the SZDSZ will inform 
the Federation of Young Democrats about beginning coalition 
talks with the MSZP. 
  It transpires from MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn's letter to Ivan 
Petoe that the political and legal guarantees of the coalition 
will also be discussed at the negotiations. The SZDSZ chairman 
said in connection with this that all this was in line with the 
SZDSZ's condition that the SZDSZ wishes to effectively influence 
the policy of the coalition government.

  [Excerpts] The convention of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] finished voting in the national sports hall in Budapest 
only a few minutes ago. Our colleague has arrived back with the 
interview she had with Gabor Kuncze [SZDSZ candidate for prime 
minister]. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Eighty 
percent 
of the delegates at the convention voted for starting coalition 
negotiations with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. How do 
you see this? 
  [Kuncze] The convention of the SZDSZ has authorized the 
executive body to accept the MSZP's invitation to start 
coalition negotiations. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] During the course of the afternoon there was 
discussion about the conditions that the SZDSZ would demand. 
  [Kuncze] [passage omitted] I think that one must not give 
details about the conditions now because the negotiating sides 
will have to decide in the knowledge of their respective terms. 
  What I consider to be important at this point is that in 
view 
of the understanding by both sides that this is not going to be 
a coalition formed on the basis of sentiments, it is not a 
coalition to be formed between natural allies, both parties must 
endeavor to reach compromises, to understand and take account of 
the other side's position, and to work to conclude a coalition 
agreement acceptable for the country. If this is achieved, then 
it will be possible to sign this agreement and the convention 
will be able to give its consent. 
  At the same time, it must be understood that if it were to 
prove impossible for either side to take into account the other 
side's concerns, then this coalition agreement will not be 
reached. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] There have been views expressed within the 
party -- and I am talking about the opinion of the membership -- 
that with this potential coalition agreement the SZDSZ might 
reach a compromise that will allow it to gain power within the 
coalition but which will endanger its base because a large 
proportion or a proportion of the membership does not quite 
agree to a coalition with the Socialists. 
  [Kuncze] I, on the other hand, think that this coalition 
agreement can be reached only by the voting support of the 
majority of the delegates who themselves had been mandated by 
the membership. If this supporting vote is there, then in a 
democratic party the minority universally accepts the majority 
view. Today I do not see such dangers. [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] At today's session of the National 
Executive [Valasztmany] of Fidesz [Federation of Young 
Democrats] all the important leaders of the party, including 
Chairman Viktor Orban, resigned. This is how they drew the 
lessons of the party's failure in the election. Correspondent 
Edit Nagy interviewed Viktor Orban. 
  [Begin recording] [Orban] National Executive Chairman Jozsef 
Szajer has resigned and so have I, from my post as party 
chairman. In effect, all the party officeholders have done the 
same -- including the deputy chairmen of the party. 
  [Nagy] Why did you make this decision? 
  [Orban] The party performed poorly at the elections--in 
terms 
of our expectations--and the responsibility for this must be 
borne by the party's highest-level elected officeholders, 
especially the chairman. 
  [Nagy] The congress will decide whether to accept the 
resignations. What do you expect? 
  [Orban] Until the next congress everybody will remain in 
place, in practice they will carry out their duties on a 
provisional acting basis, at least this is what I think. 
Tomorrow only the date for convening the congress will be 
debated, presumably sometime in June when--if the party thinks 
fit--it will be able to elect its new leaders.

  [Text] The joint venture initiating the Magyarsat program 
will have a starting capital of $50-60 million, which will be 
supplemented by international loans. The feasibility plan 
anticipates an income of $200 million during the satellite's 
11-year life span. 
  The joint venture founded by the Antenna Hungaria Company 
plans to start a satellite program called Magyarsat, we reported 
yesterday. The Hungarian regional telecommunication satellite 
could insure comprehensive and unified broadcasting and 
telecommunication in the region. 
  According to the plans, the light telecommunication 
satellite 
of the Amos family, weighing less than 1,000 kg, would be 
launched by the French carrier rocket Ariane. Currently in 
Europe, apart from international programs, two or three 
countries have their own national satellites. There is great 
demand on the market for free channels, largely because recently 
Eutelsat attempted to launch two new satellites, but the devices 
were destroyed. Magyarsat will be insured, so that investors 
would suffer no loss because of possible errors in the system. 
  The range of Magyarsat would completely cover Mid-Central 
Europe. Apart from broadcasting satellite television programs, 
it would aid business communication. Moreover, because it would 
cover the entire country, it could also alleviate telephone 
problems in areas which are hard to reach by cable. The control 
center of the satellite would be in Hungary, and Hungarian 
specialists would be in charge of its technical supervision. 
Viewers could receive the television programs using a satellite 
dish with a diameter of 70-90 cm.

  [Text] The price of gasoline will not change on 1 May, the 
price committee of the Hungarian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation 
[MOL] decided at its latest meeting. However, there will be an 
increase in price in the summer because there will be a 
considerable increase in the tax portion of fuel prices after 1 
July. 
  The April meeting of the price committee of MOL, which takes 
a monthly survey on gasoline prices on the world market, the 
effect of exchange rates, and other relevant factors, took place 
a few days ago. At its last meeting the group decided not to 
change gasoline prices on 1 May, Managing Director Gabor Jozsef 
told NEPSZABADSAG. 
  However, there will certainly be a price increase over the 
summer, possibly on 1 July when, based on a decision by 
parliament, the consumption tax portion included in the price of 
gasoline will increase. Thus, the consumption tax on leaded 
gasolines will increase from the current 33.10 forints [Ft] to 
Ft36.90, and the tax on unleaded gasoline will increase from the 
current Ft28.00 to Ft29.00. The tax on diesel fuel will increase 
to Ft26.20 from Ft23. (The 25-percent value-added tax is added 
to all this.) In other words, leaded gasoline will be Ft4.80, 
diesel fuel Ft4.00, and unleaded gasoline Ft1.50 more expensive 
because of the tax. At the same time, the actual price increase 
might be even greater because if summer seasonal factors or 
other reasons lead to an increase in oil prices, the oil company 
will obviously pass the increase on in Hungary as well.

  [Text] The Finance Ministry has prepared the draft of the 
bill necessary to establish building and loan associations. 
Hopes are that the new institutions will provide depositors with 
loans at less than 10-percent interest. 
  The head of the housing policy department of the Finance 
Ministry, Pal Cseh, told NEPSZABADSAG that 15 years ago, when 
youth savings accounts were introduced as a form of savings for 
a purpose, they were patterned on Western building and loan 
associations. By now it is possible to establish such 
institutions in Hungary as well. However, to be able to do so, 
the law on financial institutions must be amended. Banking 
experts have already developed concrete ideas. According to Pal 
Cseh, the bill can be submitted to parliament as early as this 
year. 
  The building and loan associations will be specialized 
financial institutions with special regulations on the 
management of depositors' money and on who, when, and after how 
many years of saving credit can be granted. 
  In this type of financial institution the participants 
finance each other, Pal Cseh emphasized. In other words, the 
depositors get low interest on their savings, but the conditions 
of the loans are also formulated accordingly. In the department 
head's opinion, the ideal would be if the interests on housing 
loans did not reach 10 percent. However, he said, it is not the 
task of the law to determine that. 
  Any bank already operating in Hungary will be allowed to 
establish building and loan associations but--as Pal Cseh 
pointed out--both the operation of these institutions and the 
regulations concerning them are very complicated, and therefore 
it will be beneficial to choose an experienced Western partner 
for their establishment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Ivan </F>
Rejecky; place and date not given: "We Need Cooperation With the 
Czech Republic!"] 
  [Text] No sooner was Jozef Moravcik named prime 
minister of the Slovak Republic [SR] than the newly established 
opposition began to come out with all kinds of rumors about his 
party past. However, the former dean of the Komensky University 
Law School and later minister of foreign affairs in Meciar's 
government is a level-headed person and untruths, as is evident, 
do not upset him. 
  [Rajecky] Mr. Prime Minister, although only a few weeks have 
gone by since you assumed your position as prime minister, can 
you tell us how you would evaluate the activity of the present 
government thus far, and what are, in your opinion, its greatest 
difficulties? 
  [Moravcik] Little more than one month is really a very short 
time to evaluate successes and failures. However, we created 
such conditions that will enable us to be successful and realize 
our announced governmental program. As an example, I could 
mention our successful negotiations with the IMF. A very 
favorable international climate has been created which the 
Slovak government could utilize for Slovakia's benefit. We are 
pleased that it is clear from the reaction of many citizens that 
at last a calm atmosphere reigns in our country. And what things 
did not work out? First of all, so far we have not succeeded in 
coming to an agreement on the funding of social programs. We are 
now looking for ways to make a correction in the budget, so that 
we do not keep increasing the deficit, but at the same time can 
free up a sufficient amount of money that would enable us to 
save primarily health care and education from collapse. 
  [Rajecky] The opposition accuses you, among other things, 
that by giving too many concessions to the Czech partner you are 
ruining everything that the previous government fought for and 
gained for Slovakia. According to some, it is even quite 
possible that you are endeavoring to restore the federation.... 
  [Moravcik] That is a very fallacious view on the part of the 
opposition. As far as relations with the Czech Republic are 
concerned, we have ideas on many issues about possible 
compromises that could give the impression that we are too 
accommodating. But matters must be judged from the viewpoint of 
their long-term impact and final results. Therefore, in this 
respect I consider the course of action the present government 
has taken prudent, consistently ensuring the realization of our 
goals. And as to the notion that we are endeavoring to establish 
a new federation--I believe that neither side takes the renewal 
of the federation into consideration. The creation of some kind 
of union would not bring the desired results either. But I would 
like to emphasize that I consider that idea an historically 
wasted opportunity. When the state was being split up, we could 
have, in my opinion, created a union and the disintegration of 
the federation did not have to happen. 
  [Rajecky] At present there is quite a lot of talk about the 
unresolved questions of the borders, division of former federal 
property, gold, and, most recently, certificates. Don't you 
think that some decisions of the Slovak Government, for example, 
precisely about certificates, could have an adverse effect on 
mutual relations? 
  [Moravcik] All the difficulties you mentioned have their 
specific, individual character. We could divide them into two 
groups--problems which remain from the time of the federation, 
and those which concern our future relations. I do not think 
that it is necessary to give a lot of attention to the first 
group. The second group is of more importance to us, especially 
as far as the certificates and the customs union are concerned, 
where, by the way, very close connections exist, because that 
cooperation also has its political aspects, even though the 
economic ones are dominant. What is important is that both sides 
have a political interest in maintaining mutual cooperation and 
mutual linkages minimally at the present level. But I do not 
rule out the possibility that we could have a situation where 
one side comes to the conclusion that cooperation in its present 
form is not to its advantage. Then we would have to look for 
other solutions. But I would not consider it a tragedy in any 
case, and for less a possibility that it would lead to a 
worsening of our mutual relations. 
  [Rajecky] There is a lot of work to do, and you do not have 
much time in which to realize your goals. Nevertheless--are you 
not planning a meeting with your Czech counterpart, Vaclav 
Klaus, in the near future? 
  [Moravcik] It is incumbent on politicians to meet with their 
foreign partners whenever it is useful. But I have to say that a 
meeting with Prime Minister Klaus is not being planned for the 
immediate future. 
  [Rajecky] You are said to be a reasonable, thoughtful, and 
hard-working person. Are you not upset, therefore, by some of 
the accusations leveled at you, for example, that while prime 
minister you became chairman of a new political party, which 
broke the coalition agreements, as the chairman of the Party of 
Democratic Left [SDL], Peter Weiss, asserted? 
  [Moravcik] If criticism is based on truthful arguments, it 
cannot upset me. But I admit that not even unsubstantiated 
criticism upsets me, although in Slovakia there is more of it 
than of the justified kind. It demonstrates the fact that 
political culture here is not always of the optimal level. As 
far as my chairmanship of the Slovak Democratic Union [DEUS] is 
concerned, Petr Weiss and I have already cleared the entire 
matter up between us. He appreciated the fact that it says in 
our bylaws that if the chairman of DEUS is named to a government 
position his function is perfomed by a statutory deputy. 
  [Rajecky] The opposition also criticizes you for the fact 
that although the main task of your government was to lead the 
country to early parliamentary elections, your plans extend well 
beyond the pre-election period. Do you expect, then, that your 
government will be here even after the fall elections? 
  [Moravcik] The measures that are adopted always must be of a 
long-term character. After all, not even laws are passed for 
just six months, but for four years, even decades. From this 
viewpoint, it would be very wrong if we were to concentrate only 
on the period before the early elections. And as to the duration 
of our mandate? That, after all, will not be decided by the 
opposition. We have a constitutional mandate and responsibility 
for executive power. We are not responsible to the opposition 
but to all the citizens of Slovakia. 
  [Rajecky] Let's go back to the international issues. There 
has been a lot of talk lately about the possibility that you 
will meet with the Hungarian prime minister, but you are said to 
have laid down conditions that are unacceptable to the 
Hungarians. At the same time, the solution of the "Hungarian" 
issue is vitally important for SR.... 
  [Moravcik] ...both sides insist that they are ready to talk, 
but so far a meeting has not taken place. But the truth is that 
only an unofficial meeting is under consideration, because 
official contacts should always produce some concrete result, 
some concrete document. I admit--such is not ready. But in any 
case, even an unofficial meeting has its value, because at the 
very least it provides opportunity for an exchange views and 
mutual consultations. At this time we are interested in an 
informal meeting with the Hungarian side. 
  [Rajecky] Isn't it something of a speculation on your part, 
that since there will be elections in Hungary before long, you 
would rather wait to negotiate with the new government? 
  [Moravcik] No, there is no speculation on our part. When it 
comes to the solving of serious problems, the question of 
elections really stays in the background. Hungary and Slovakia 
have formulated the basic features of their foreign policy 
concepts, and those do not change. 
  [Rajecky] In conclusion a question concerning your deputy 
prime minister and party colleague, Roman Kovac. The opposition, 
specifically the HZDS deputies' club in the SR National Council, 
demands his removal. What do you think about the reasons they 
give? 
  [Moravcik] They do not have concrete arguments, they use 
only 
general accusations. As I know the authors of these slanders, 
they are capable of making up most anything."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Educated Respondents Approve </F>
Meciar's Downfall"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--More than two-fifths of Slovak citizens 
(44 percent) accepted the removal of V. Meciar from the position 
of prime minister. Almost the same number of citizens (39 
percent) disagreed with Meciar's having to step down. That is 
indicated by the results of the opinion poll conducted by the 
Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic made public yesterday. 
According to the statisticians, almost one-fifth of those asked 
(17 percent) did not follow the events taking place in the 
parliament. 
  The results of the poll show that the more educated the 
respondent, the more often he or she approved the recall of the 
prime minister. The change was very well received by citizens of 
Hungarian nationality, entrepreneurs, employees and adherents of 
the newly formed parties of "dissidents" from Meciar's camp. The 
vote of no confidence given to Meciar was welcomed by 70 percent 
of those queried who came from the ranks of supporters of the 
Christian Democrats and the left. Disapproval understandably was 
predominant among adherents of the Movement for Democratic 
Slovakia, somewhat less so among supporters of the Slovak 
National Party.

  [Text] As we have already reported in our previous 
bulletins, the National Council of the Slovak Republic today 
rejected the so-called road sign bill initiated by the 
government. According to Deputy Speaker Peter Weiss, it was 
shown that extremists on both sides were incapable of reaching a 
compromise agreement. He went on to remark that the bill had 
taken into account all of the most important amendments, 
including those made by the opposition. 
  Tibor Cabaj, deputy for the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia, said that sound reason had prevailed. According to 
him, the bill had not been well prepared, and, when amendments 
that had been submitted to improve it had failed to be 
incorporated, the way the opposition would vote had been quite 
clear. On the other hand, Vladimir Miskovsky, deputy for the 
National Democratic Party, was of the opinion that the 
amendments submitted had improved the bill to such an extent 
that it ought to have accommodated all tolerant people, both the 
Hungarian minority and the Slovaks living in the south of the 
country. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Movement, saw the reason for the rejection of the bill in the 
fact that towns named after important Slovak figures had been 
excluded from the requirement to display bilingual signs. Pal 
Csaky, deputy for the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement-Coexistence, commented on the rejection of the bill by 
saying that the matter was serious and that the party would draw 
conclusions from the breaking of the coalition agreement. Arpad 
Duka Zolyomi, representing the same party, had envisaged that 
the coalition partners would ensure the implementation of the 
agreement reached in the coalition council. He said that it 
would obviously be necessary to hold discussions about further 
cooperation.

<F P=106> [Article by "bog, mh, rk": "Vojtech Bugar: Agreements Are </F>
Being Successively Fulfilled"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--According to a CTK report, Miklos 
Duray, chairman of the Coexistence Movement, said in Lucenec on 
28 May that Moravcik's government was not keeping the promises 
it had given the Hungarian political parties when it came into 
being. According to Coexistence representatives, the present 
government should sign the European charters on local 
self-administration and regional languages by September. 
According to Duray, if the government fails to sign the two 
documents, Coexistence will consider whether it wants to 
continue supporting the government. We have asked 
representatives of the coalition parties whether the agreement 
between the coalition and the Hungarian parties is being 
fulfilled and whether the commitment to sign the two 
aforementioned European charters forms part of the agreement. 
  Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement: It is true that we would be glad if 
the two charters were signed, and it does not matter whether 
this happens in September or October. However, this issue is 
not part of the agreements between the coalition and us. In 
other words, we cannot demand that the government sign the 
documents. The eight points of the agreement that we discussed 
during the government's formation are being successively 
fulfilled. They could be fulfilled quicker, in our opinion, but 
claiming that the government is not fulfilling our demands is 
too strong a statement. The passage of the law on [birth, 
marriage, and death] registers and the prepared law on bilingual 
signs furnish clear evidence of the fulfillment of mutual 
agreements. Even a blind person must see that. Therefore, I 
cannot agree with Mr. Duray's view published in the press. 
Ultimately, his words will be abused by the opposition and the 
mass media, which is unfortunate. This will complicate our 
efforts to prove that the ethnic Hungarian parties are capable 
of effective cooperation with the Slovak Government. We do not 
have the moral right to link the support of Jozef Moravcik's 
government to the signing of the aforementioned European 
charters because such an agreement simply does not exist. 
  Jozef Moravcik, chairman of Democratic Union: 
During the formation of the government, we held talks with the 
Hungarian parties and explained to them the government's coarse 
of action in matters that are of interest to them. The result 
of these talks was that everything on which we agree would be 
contained in the government's policy statement, which is what 
happened. There exists no other document, apart from the policy 
statement, in which we would commit ourselves to something. I 
see no reason for the Hungarian side to arrive at the conclusion 
that was suggested by Mr. Duray--that is, to stop supporting 
this government. 
  Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic 
Movement: The present government coalition's promise to the 
Hungarian parties was that we would meet the Council of Europe 
recommendations--that is, we would resolve the problem of 
Christian and family names and the problem of bilingual signs. 
We also agreed that we would not deal before the elections with 
the issue of alternative education and the territorial and 
administrative arrangement. At the same time, we have not 
abandoned these ideas. There exists no written document about 
all of this. The coalition did not undertake to sign the 
European charters on local self-administration and regional 
languages. It is true that the Coexistence Movement had 
proposed this in the initial phase of talks, but we did not come 
to an agreement on this issue. 
  Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the National Democratic 
Party-New Alternative: I was present at all talks that 
preceded the formation of the present coalition and declare that 
there exists neither an agreement with the Hungarian parties nor 
a relevant supplement to the original coalition agreement. 
Everything that had been agreed upon at these talks and that 
was approved by all of the coalition partners is being complied 
with and honored. Likewise, I do not know anything about a 
commitment adopted by the coalition to sign the charters on 
local self-administration and regional languages by September.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Christian Democratic Movement, by Roman Vegh; place and date not 
given: "Conditions for Three-Member Coalition of Ethnic 
Hungarian Parties"] 
  [Excerpt] [Vegh] The all-Slovak Council of the 
Coexistence Movement has decided to form a coalition with the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and the Hungarian 
Civic Party [MOS] for the fall elections. [passage omitted] You 
must be pleased with that decision. 
  [Bugar] I am not so enthusiastic about the decision. There 
are matters on which we had already agreed with Coexistence--for 
example, that the conditions for the formation of a coalition 
would not include a common club of deputies because it is far 
more advantageous to have two clubs than just one. When someone 
formulates this condition, nonetheless, and adds that, if the 
MKDH does not agree, there will not be a coalition, he is 
actually shifting the blame to us. I cannot agree with that. 
We have therefore resolved to inform the mass media about every 
meeting we hold on the formation of the three-member 
coalition--if, for no other reason, than to let the voters find 
out who is actually slowing down the formation of the 
three-member coalition and who is asserting only narrow party 
interests. When something like that happens, all of society 
must know about it. We cannot play a game in which the voter 
learns about the result but does not know anything about its 
course. We will not accept that. 
  [Vegh] How do you assess the conditions that Coexistence set 
for MOS? 
  [Bugar] So far, we only know about them from the press, 
which is why we have called for an early meeting with 
Coexistence to discuss them. It could very well happen that we 
will not agree with some conditions. As I have already said, 
even now we disagree with a common club of deputies. Moreover, 
I am curious whether MOS, too, will agree with the conditions 
that have been published in the media. Personally, I do not 
consider it appropriate to say in advance: Take it or leave it. 
That is an ultimatum that need not be accepted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister for Privatization Milan Janicin by </F>
Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not given: "HZDS Privatization 
Methods Cannot Be Used"] 
  [Text] Milan Janicin, deputy chairman of the National 
Democratic Party [NDS], was entrusted with the post of minister 
of privatization. He spoke with the Bratislava reporter of 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY about how he envisions his management of the 
ministry. 
  [Zabojnik] What were the conditions in the ministry when you 
took it over? 
  [Janicin] I'll repeat what I already said in response to an 
American journalist's question: What I appreciate about my 
predecessors is the fact that they did not succeed in alienating 
or firing all the able people in this ministry. 
  [Zabojnik] Have you also found some things about your 
predecessors that were on the borderline of legality, or even 
went beyond it in the feverish privatization before the change 
of government? 
  [Janicin] They may have been on the borderline, but in 
Slovakia there is still concern that some residuals may be 
brought back to life. People are still afraid and do not want to 
testify on certain matters. For example, I know without a doubt 
that in the case of the Piestany Spa there existed or still 
exists a silent partnership agreement concerning two former 
members of the government and one high legislative official. But 
I cannot make their names public because they refused to turn 
over a copy of the agreement to me. 
  [Zabojnik] What would give courage to people who have 
information not to keep silent and furnish the evidence? 
  [Janicin] I am convinced that after the elections, when it 
will be clear to everybody that Meciar will not be forming a new 
government, the evidence will see the light of day. 
  [Zabojnik] As far as methods are concerned, you took over as 
a kind of legacy the emphasis on employee-owned corporations and 
more or less a distaste for the voucher system of privatization. 
What concept do you intend to apply? 
  [Janicin] The management in those enterprises established in 
some instances the so-called employee-owned corporations. With 
various promises and sometimes even with pressure they obtained 
signatures of the other workers in the enterprise. Following the 
political line of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] 
and later also of the Slovak National Party [SNS] they made 
every effort to acquire the property. Then in the populist 
style "sold" it to the employees and these were the famous 
employee-owned corporations. As far as the voucher privatization 
is concerned, the method was declared marginal, because 
according to the HZDS the shares would have been sold below 
price in view of the weak Slovak resources, and according to 
that line of thinking foreign capital would easily gain control 
over the Slovak economy. Therefore, for example according to Mr. 
Huska, it is necessary to first and foremost enable Slovak 
entrepreneurs to acquire property in the privatization. I admit 
that for a certain time even I was, so to speak, blinded by such 
thinking. But when one ponders this matter, and most of all when 
one saw how it was being realized in practice, when for example 
the Vrutky Railroad Repair Shops with a book value of 950 
million korunas were to be sold for 120 million to party 
followers of the HZDS and the SNS, one's thinking necessarily 
had to change. 
  [Zabojnik] What conclusion do you draw from it for your 
specific course of action as minister? 
  [Janicin] I came to the conclusion that for Slovakia coupon 
privatization is at present obviously the quickest method for 
transforming ownership. Moreover, credit resources here are so 
exhausted that it would not be logical to use them to change the 
ownership structure. And there are also the social aspects. 
Coupon privatization is a certain positive step toward the 
social sphere. It is also related to the need for political 
stability in Slovakia, without which we shall not be able to 
join the developed countries. Therefore we can no longer afford 
any more experiments a la the HZDS.

[Czechoslovak Foreign Trade Bank], the state's deposits with 
international banks, the state's deposits in domestic companies, 
claims from financial assistance and realized guarantees, and 
securities and other claims--amounted to 99.3 billion Slovak 
korunas [Sk]. On the other hand, state financial 
liabilities--the state's liabilities with the NBS, the 
government's liabilities with foreign partners, the state's 
liabilities with commercial banks, liabilities abroad taken over 
from Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, and liabilities stemming 
from the issue of state bonds--amounted to Sk96 billion. Hence, 
the Slovak Republic's property and financial position was that 
of a creditor to the tune of Sk3.3 billion. 
  By the end of last year, the Slovak Republic's creditor's 
position turned into that of a debtor, with state financial 
liabilities exceeding state financial assets by Sk19.3 billion. 
(This sum includes the liability of Sk5.8 billion stemming from 
the clearing account with the Czech Republic.) The change, 
compared with the beginning of the year, between the level of 
state financial assets and liabilities represents minus Sk22.6 
billion. "This situation results chiefly from the Sk21.84 
billion rise in debts with the NBS and the Sk3.69 billion rise 
in debts with other domestic economic entities. In relation to 
foreign countries, on the other hand, the Slovak Republic's 
creditor's position has become even stronger," states the draft 
of the state closing account of the Slovak Republic for 1993. 
The draft continues: "On the side of state financial assets, 
the greatest growth was registered by government claims against 
foreign partners, which now constitute 56.5 percent of all state 
financial assets. The increase was due mainly to the crediting 
of interest and exchange rate differences to the account." 
  The increase in state financial liabilities, on the other 
hand, was caused mainly by the growth in the state's liabilities 
with the NBS, which financed the state budget deficit of 
Sk23.011 billion, the report states.

<F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Consultations on the Import Surcharge"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday's consultative meeting of 
economic ministers, which was held in the presence of IMF 
Executive Director Willi Kiekens, discussed the "Memorandum on 
Economic Policies." 
  At a news conference convened during the course of the 
meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova announced 
that matters have been closed 98 percent and that, apparently, 
they would not be reopened at today's government meeting. 
  In the social sphere, social payments will be targeted more 
specifically. The IMF mission demands that the government 
expeditiously discuss the import surcharge with GATT. The 
method of its introduction in March had not been consulted and 
was rather unusual. Moreover, there have been several changes 
compared with the version approved last summer. 
  In the memorandum, the government takes upon itself certain 
obligations concerning the economic development in 1995. The 
rate of inflation should be kept at 8 percent, but it could be 
slightly higher following price increases for electricity, heat, 
and gas. The government's intention is to keep a single-digit 
rate of inflation. The state budget deficit should be under 3 
percent of the gross domestic product [GDP], which is 1 percent 
less than anticipated this year. Following the zero growth of 
the GDP projected for this year, the GDP should grow 2 percent 
next year. Brigita Schmognerova said that the 1995 targets 
should serve as an important signal for domestic and foreign 
investors. 
  The continued provision of tax relief and tax holidays is 
being reconsidered. They will most likely be kept this year but 
should be abolished next year in the interest of the creation of 
a consistent environment. The need is also becoming apparent to 
abolish tax relief for purchases of State Treasury bills and 
other securities because these types of securities enjoy a 
preferred standing on the capital market. The effects of wage 
regulation, which should apply to loss-making companies and 
designated sectors, will be analyzed at the end of the year and, 
on the basis of this analysis, the continuation of wage 
regulation in 1995 will be considered. The intentions in the 
sphere of privatization are formulated quite specifically. The 
basic intention is to speed up the process, a fact that the IMF 
and the World Bank assess very positively. The government 
undertakes to deal more vigorously with the financial situation 
in the company sector and in commercial banks. This will 
involve mutually harmonized measures aimed at reducing 
interenterprise indebtedness and tackling bad loans and parallel 
activities by the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development and PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland 
and Hungary]. 
  Jozef Trojak, state secretary at the Ministry of Finance, 
provided information on debt servicing. This year, the state 
budget will have to spend 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] on the 
repayment of the principal and interest (of which the Slovak 
National Bank [NBS] will pay Sk12 billion); next year, debt 
servicing will increase to Sk40 billion (of which Sk9.6 billion 
will come from the NBS). This growth forces us to mobilize the 
generation of resources. A burden from the past is the debt of 
Sk54 billion resulting from the division of the debts of the 
federal budget. It is expected that, as in the Czech Republic, 
resources from the National Property Fund will be used to cover 
this debt.

<F P=106> [Article by CI, CTK: "Slovak Health Care on the Brink of </F>
Collapse"] 
  [Text] Bratislava (CI, CTK)--You cannot talk about a 
transformation of health care in Slovakia because today it 
hovers on the brink of collapse, Minister of Health Tibor Sagat 
said yesterday. He referred particularly to the "unfortunate" 
systemic measures of the previous government "introduced in a 
badly planned time sequence," incompetent changes in the 
management of hospitals, and the discontinuation of the 
transformation system of health insurance. The difference in the 
development of health care in the Czech Republic [CR] and in 
Slovakia after the division of CSFR is, according to him, the 
result of better leadership of the Czech Ministry of Health, 
which managed to provide cogent evidence in support of its 
needs. "That, unfortunately, was not the case here," he added. 
  Minister Sagat sees the greatest shortcoming of the former 
government of Vladimir Meciar in the neglect of the financing of 
health care, which led to an uneven indebtedness of health care 
facilities. According to him, health care needs 4 or 5 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk] more than is provided in the budget for this 
year (Sk15.7 billion). At the same time, the internal 
indebtedness of health care facilities amounts to, according to 
him, to as much as Sk50 billion. 
  As a possible source of needed additional funds, the 
minister 
mentioned an increase of the budget deficit, which the Slovak 
leadership is discussing with IMF representatives in 
Washington. Loans from some European as well as non-European 
countries should provide another source for the financing of 
health care. The minister expects that they will be granted by 1 
July this year at the latest, at which time he is planning to 
make some changes in the financing and economic management of 
health care facilities. 
  The foreign loans should create the "start-up" capital for 
insurance companies, which are unable, given the "irregular and 
variable" collection of insurance premiums, to cover the deficit 
in their own resources. In this connection he mentioned the need 
for the state to better meet its obligations. The state, 
according to him, provides only 10 percent for the health 
services to children and retirees, which is less than Sk40 per 
day. 
  Minister Sagat is in favor of separating the funds of health 
care and social services insurance in the National Insurance 
Agency. The fact that the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of 
Labor and Social Services did not come to an agreement on where 
health care insurance should belong, led to a compromise 
solution and the creation of the National Insurance Agency. But 
the six months of its activity did not bring the expected 
results, and the separation of the two funds is to be expected.

  [Text] Geneva, 4 Jun (TANJUG) -- The first round of the 
working consultations on the territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina between representatives of the three warring 
sides and the Contact Group has ended in the French Embassy in 
Geneva. 
  The maps, offered on the basis of drawings by a group of 
experts in Washington, are the maps for war, not for peace, 
Aleksa Buha, foreign minister for the Srpska republic, told 
journalists from TANJUG and Serb Sarajevo Radio-Television. The 
maps give 51 percent of Bosnian territory to the Muslims and 
Croats, and 49 percent to the Serbs, as proposed in the 
declaration adopted in Geneva on 13 May. But according to Buha, 
the talks should start with the percentage agreed upon within 
the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which is 30 percent for the Muslims, 
16.5 for the Croats, and 53.5 for the Serbs. 
  The maps currently on offer have turned the Srpska republic 
into separate unconnected areas, which suggests the Muslim 
concept of a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is absolutely 
unacceptable for the Serb side, Buha said. 
  Talking about the end of the first round of talks, Srpska 
republic president Radovan Karadzic said that during the 
exchange of opinions, it became obvious that the Contact Group 
favored the Muslim side. 
  The talks on the cessation of hostilities have not yet 
started in the Palais des Nations in Geneva. A Srpska republic 
delegation has arrived in the Palais and is waiting for the 
arrival of the Muslim and Croat delegations who have been 
invited to the meeting by UN Special Envoy Yasushi Akashi after 
the news that the Serbs had withdrawn from the 3-km zone around 
Gorazde.

  [Text] Ljubljana, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Slovene Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek has warned the Croatian leadership that Slovenia 
will make "some political moves" unless Zagreb accepts 
Ljubljana's demands for the resolution of the problem of the 
state border between the two former Yugoslav republics. 
  The Croatian Government last night rejected the Slovene 
Foreign Ministry's proposal that Slovenia take over full control 
of the Bay of Piran, and Croatia continue the building of the 
Secovje border crossing near Portoroz. On this occasion, 
Drnovsek threatened to cancel the official visit of Slovene 
President Milan Kucan to Croatia and place the Secovje border 
crossing down the list of priorities. 
  Despite the claims of Prime Minister Drnovsek that Slovenia 
is opposed to a further exacerbation of relations, the official 
cancellation of Kucan's visit to Zagreb, scheduled for 7 June, 
is expected soon. The failure of the Slovene president to 
depart for Zagreb would represent yet another diplomatic clash 
between Ljubljana and Zagreb, which until recently were firm 
allies, and mutual relations would fall to an ever lower level.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 5 (TANJUG) -- The vice-president of 
the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), academician Mihajlo 
Markovic, said on Saturday evening [5 June] he had not taken 
part in any kind of talks with the representatives of the 
Albanian minority living in Serbia's southern Kosovo province 
and that noone had given him such a task. 
  Last week the British press announced that Markovic had met 
in an embassy in Belgrade with the Kosovo ethnic Albanian 
representatives. 
  "The Kosovo Albanians are still unwilling to take part in a 
dialogue. They continue nurturing hopes that the big powers, 
primarily the United States, will give them their own state, but 
nothing will come out of that. The prevailing stand is that 
minorities cannot secede and this also refers to the ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo," Markovic told a meeting of young 
socialists in Jagodina, town in central Serbia. 
  He said that before long they (ethnic Albanians) will have 
to 
sit down at the negotiating table if they want something to 
change in their favour, because they have excluded themselves 
from the political and economic activities of Serbia and 
Yugoslavia. 
  A strong separatist ethnic Albanian movement has for decades 
been active in Kosovo. The separatists advocate the province's 
secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and its annexation to 
neighbouring Albania. 
  Since they refuse to accept Serbia as their mother country, 
the separatist leaders over the past four years pressured the 
people to boycott the parliamentary and presidential elections 
in Serbia. 
  The talks will take place, but whether they will be held in 
the form of informal and not-binding talks between 
intellectuals, or at the official level, will shortly be 
announced, Markovic said.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by an unidentified </F>
correspondent on 3 June; place not given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Havel] Analyzing the parliament's deliberations 
about the electoral law, analyzing it on the basis of all 
discussions preempting this issue, all discussions about this 
issue, I take the view that what is lacking here is the 
political will to form the senate and thus to comply with the 
Constitution. 
  I consider this to be a rather serious situation. In my 
view, either the existing Constitution, regardless of how much 
or how little we like it, is to be observed, with the 
constitutional system functioning normally, or--and this is the 
worse possibility--the Constitution has to be amended. In fact, 
the worst possibility is when the Constitution is valid but is 
not being complied with because this is an undemocratic state of 
affairs. I cannot imagine a democracy where, for instance, it 
would be impossible to dissolve a parliament--and this is the 
situation today because the senate does not exist. 
  If there is no will to have a senate, it is necessary to 
follow the second option, which is worse than complying with the 
Constitution but still better than the current state of affairs. 
In other words, it is necessary to amend the Constitution. 
However, if this is the case, it is not enough to simply delete 
the word "senate," as somebody has already suggested. It 
demands a full rethink of the respective three chapters of the 
Constitution and a rethink of all constitutional aspects, 
relations between individual constitutional officials, in order 
to form a functioning constitutional system. The senate had its 
essential role in this system, and it is not possible to simply 
omit it and think the system will function without it. 
  [Correspondent] In the context of what you have just said, I 
would like to mention today's proposal by the KDU-CSL [Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party], which calls for a 
parliamentary commission to initiate the amendment of the 
Constitution. The amendment would aim at abolishing the senate, 
some of whose powers would be transferred to the president of 
the Republic. 
  [Havel] I think this initiative is probably good and 
necessary because some action has to be taken. We cannot live 
forever in this untenable situation. The problem of how to 
divide the powers of the senate is another question. Probably 
some of them would have to be transferred to the head of state. 
This is possible, but it is a matter for the parliament to 
discuss. 
  [Correspondent] Is it possible to call the current situation 
a constitutional crisis, as some politicians have done? 
  [Havel] I would not say that we have found ourselves in a 
constitutional crisis. We have only found ourselves in a 
situation that would prevent us from solving a constitutional or 
political crisis if such a crisis arises. 
  [Correspondent] Do you think it is essential to solve this 
problem quickly? 
  [Havel] Yes, I do.

Horn as the MSZP's nomination for prime minister. 
  [Nagy] So there will be one candidate? 
  [Szekeres] Yes. Of course, I informed the presidium that the 
name of Laszlo Bekesi [author of the MSZP's economic program] 
had also been raised, as a minority opinion. By the way, we 
invited Laszlo Bekesi to the presidium session. He also outlined 
his views on political and personnel issues. 
  The presidium has confirmed that the MSZP program in 
economic 
as well as in other areas is the program we presented to the 
people during the election campaign, and it is on this program 
that we wish to hold talks with the possible coalition partners.

  [Text] The protesting miners of Dudar will not demonstrate 
after all in front of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The 
demonstration planned for today has been canceled because, 
through the mediation of the president of the Republic, the 
trade union came to an agreement with the State Property 
Management Corporation [AVRT], the owner of the Hungarian Power 
Plants Trust [MVMT], we learned from Antal Schalkhammer, 
president of the Interior Ministry Employees Trade Union [BDSZ]. 
  The BDSZ planned a protest because the Bakony Power Plant 
Corporation decided not to receive, as of April, the monthly 
5,500 metric tons of coal for the power plant which they 
contracted for with the Dudar Coal Mine because the demand on 
the Inota Power Plant decreased by half. After the contract was 
unilaterally terminated, the mine became insolvent; this, in 
turn, endangered the jobs of 340 miners. Furthermore, the 
situation of mining companies that were left out of the power 
plant-coal mine integration program established through an 
agreement between the government and the trade union in January 
became impossible. 
  "The affected mines, the BDSZ, and the AVRT agreed yesterday 
that with the help of independent experts they would prepare a 
joint analysis of the possibilities for financing mines," Antal 
Schalkhammer told NEPSZABADSAG. He added: In this way it will 
become possible for mines not included in the integration 
program to avoid being closed down. In the next two months, the 
experts will scrutinize the situation of the mines. Until then, 
the AVRT will help so that the miners can be paid. Furthermore, 
the property management corporation introduced a motion that 
requests submitted by mines to the Labor Ministry for personnel 
power management assistance be evaluated quicker. 
  "Because the jobs of several thousand people are on the 
line, 
as a last resort I appealed to President Arpad Goncz," the BDSZ 
chairman said. "Without the president's mediation, yesterday's 
agreement could not have been concluded," he declared.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ivan Horsky: "Signing of Stability Pact </F>
Within a Year"] 
  [Text] The timing of the Conference on Stability in 
Europe, which took place in Paris late last week, was by no 
means accidental. On 1 July, Germany will become the presiding 
country of the European Union, and, immediately thereafter, as 
of the new year, this role will be taken over by France. Paris 
supposes that, by the end of this year, French diplomacy will 
succeed, with Bonn's assistance, in pushing matters forward so 
that the Stability Pact can be signed. Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur, the author of the original idea, must score this 
success for a quite prosaic reason: He wants to become successor 
to President Francois Mitterrand and expects such an 
international triumph to greatly strengthen his chances. 
  For this reason, French diplomacy did everything it could to 
ensure the conference's success. This becomes most evident when 
we take a look at the changes that the original Balladur plan 
has undergone; it really has changed beyond recognition. 
  What Slovakia as well as other countries considered to be of 
the greatest importance was the acceptance of one of the major 
CSCE principles--the inviolability of the existing borders. One 
could even argue that, if this did not happen, the whole 
initiative would probably have gone down in the textbooks of 
diplomacy as one of the examples of abortive activities. 
  It needs to be said--without schadenfreude but, still, with 
satisfaction--that the results of the Paris conference signify 
the end of the hopes of certain circles in Hungary, and also 
abroad, that had hoped for possible revision of the borders with 
Hungary's neighbors and, thereby, for a precedent to be set. 
This disappointment was to be felt also in Paris in the speech 
of [Hungarian Foreign Minister] Geza Jeszenszky, for whom 
participation in the conference apparently was his swan song as 
the chief of Hungarian diplomacy. Still, even when we use 
moderate and diplomatic terms, his words startled and struck the 
audience by their confrontational tone, which also met with the 
appropriate response. In the end, the overwhelming majority 
qualified this as a last attempt to save political face in the 
face of one's own fiasco. 
  The focus of work in the forthcoming period will be on 
preparatory negotiations to determine the exact dates of two 
regional roundtables. The first will pertain to the Central 
European region and will involve Slovakia and Hungary. The 
other will involve the Baltic countries. Five areas of problems 
are to be discussed, but the agenda could be expanded if new 
issues emerge. 
  In this context, it needs to be stressed again that 
representatives of ethnic minorities will not be able to 
directly participate in these roundtables. This applies, in 
particular, to the Hungarian minority, whose representatives 
have demanded this possibility most vehemently, with Budapest's 
support. However, as Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik stressed 
some time ago and as has been confirmed by [Foreign Minister] 
Eduard Kukan, the Slovak Government is not only ready but also 
determined to not only brief the minority's representatives 
before and after the talks but also to consult them on problems 
concerning the minorities. The principle was adopted in Paris 
that relations between states are involved, in which only 
subjects of international law can participate. 
  One cannot but express the hope that the work on bilateral 
documents that will be a part of the pact, as well as the 
roundtables, will be marked by a constructive spirit, even if 
polemics cannot be ruled out in advance. However, Bonn and 
Paris will quite certainly try to prove their active attitude 
toward the problems of Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, 
we can expect a very rapid solution to any disputed problems so 
that the final document can be signed no later than in one 
year's time. Let us only hope that the signing will not be 
accompanied by problems such as occurred while taking the 
so-called family portrait, when the quite undiplomatic hustle on 
the wooden platform almost caused diplomatic and human tragedy. 
However, this was probably the French organizers' only serious 
mistake.

  [Text] Skopje, 2 Jun (TANJUG) -- Stojan Andov, president of 
the Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- 
FYROM] assembly, arrived in Tirana today on a two-day official 
and friendly visit to Albania, Radio Skopje reported from the 
Albanian capital. This morning Andov held talks for one hour 
with Pjeter Arbnori, president of the Albanian assembly. They 
exchanged views on the cooperation between the two assemblies 
and states and on the situation in the Balkans. 
  Arbnori said that Macedonia and Albania "cooperate well in 
many domains," and that "they are very good neighbors." The 
cooperation would be even better if the Albanians in Macedonia 
were granted "all rights," Arbnori said. 
  Andov said that there were "many problems" between the two 
states, but, he stressed, "a way of solving them has been 
found." According to him, the problems connected with the rights 
of the Albanians in Macedonia are dealt with in the institutions 
of the system in line with the highest European standards on 
minority rights, or even better. He expressed the hope that the 
Macedonians in Albania would be granted the same rights and 
freedoms. 
  The president of the assembly of the Former Yugoslav 
Republic 
of Macedonia today also had a meeting with Albanian President 
Sali Berisha. Berisha said that he expected this visit to 
contribute to the further development of cooperation between the 
two countries and that he was happy that what he had agreed on 
with President Gligorov during their meeting last month in 
Pogradec was being realized. The Albanian president welcomed 
the adoption of the law on the population census in Macedonia 
and noted the need to develop traffic links between the two 
countries, including the links with the port of Durres, which 
should serve the Macedonian economy as well. 
  During the talks, Berisha also mentioned the position of the 
Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija and spoke against forcible 
changes to the border. Berisha thanked Gligorov for his 
invitation to visit Macedonia and announced his visit to Skopje 
in the near future. 
  During his talks with Berisha, Andov said that "essential 
steps forward have been taken" in the cooperation between 
Macedonia and Albania and that "there are no obstacles to the 
development and strengthening of cooperation." According to 
Andov, Macedonia and Albania are "linked in terms of their fate 
and oriented toward one other."

<F P=106> [Article by A. Stafa: "Albania -- A Country With Higher </F>
Imports From the European Union] 
  [Text] According to statistical data extracted from 
special IMF studies on the import-export level of several 
Central European countries, Albania has the highest import 
figures from the EU countries, [words indistinct] leaving behind 
Poland, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and so on. Albanian 
imports for 1993 accord to the percent of its total 
international trade with these countries, i.e. of its total 
imports, whose percentage has grown from one year to another. 
According to the IMF's statistical data, from 31.4 percent in 
1989, this index reached 40.6 percent in 1990 and in 1992 it 
made its biggest jump of around 23 percent, reaching the figure 
of 63.2 percent of its total general imports. Thus, Albania has 
been among the first countries regarding imports from other 
Central European countries since 1992. 
  The liberalization of international trade, after a long 
period of restrictions, the establishment of acceptable and 
affordable tariffs, and the most favored nation status gained by 
many European countries during their transition periods, made it 
possible for 1990-1992 to become boom years in international 
trade. In the meanwhile, again according to the IMF's data on 
exports to the EU countries, Poland reached, at the end of this 
four-year period, the highest level, which accounted for 56.5 
percent of its total exports, while Albania was listed after 
Bulgaria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic with 38.2 percent of 
its total exports, leaving only Romania behind. 
  The Albanian parliament's lifting of customs taxes on 
commodity exports will further liberalize this sector and, 
according to the specialists, changes in the export-import 
growth level are expected, with exports growing faster than 
imports. The continued agreements among countries on free 
trade, on the lifting of double taxation, and on the creation of 
various facilities in international trade hold out hopes for the 
continuation of this international exchange and a high level.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec by </F>
Fernando de Sousa in Prague; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [De Sousa] What is the main aim 
of your visit to Portugal? 
  [Zieleniec] We feel that we are an integral part of the 
European continent, so it is natural and logical for us to 
communicate as if we were neighbors. Portugal belongs to the 
European Union [EU] and the Atlantic alliance. For us it is 
natural that the logic of our course tends toward those 
institutions. It is necessary to talk, as well as to exchange 
experiences and views on those realities, with a view to a 
mutual understanding. 
  In addition, bilateral contacts are very important. The two 
countries are of a similar size, trade must not be overlooked, 
and it is natural for it to become necessary to create 
conditions essential for trade. I will also be signing an 
agreement preventing double taxation -- one of the essential 
conditions for the sound development of economic relations. I 
would also like to recall that President Soares visited the 
country immediately after our revolution, in a very complex 
situation, and we regard this as proof of deep friendship and 
trust. 
  [De Sousa] Moreover, President Soares will be coming here 
again this year.... 
  [Zieleniec] Yes, this is planned, and he will have the 
opportunity to see how this country has altered, how Prague has 
changed its appearance. He will be able to see everything that 
has been done by us. So we are very glad to have the 
opportunity and the chance to welcome the Portuguese president 
again. 
  [De Sousa] On this visit to Lisbon, you will also have the 
opportunity to raise the Czech intention to join the EU and to 
explain that plan to the Portuguese.... 
  [Zieleniec] In our opinion, it is very natural that we 
should some day belong to the EU, because it includes the 
countries which are our family, with which we have had dealings 
throughout our history. So I believe that it will not be 
necessary to explain this aim. If the Czech Republic did not 
wish to join, then it would be necessary to give explanations.... 
  [De Sousa] In any event, one of the matters which will be 
raised by the member states such as Portugal during the 
membership negotiations when they are held will be the 
competition of countries such as the Czech Republic for 
Community funds, which at that time will have to be shared out 
by more European regions. Will this aspect also be broached in 
Lisbon? 
  [Zieleniec] I believe that it is possible to discuss every 
kind of issue linked to the membership process, but it is 
necessary to observe the changes in our country over the past 
four or five years and the dynamism of our economic development. 
  I believe that our republic will soon be in a position to be 
able contribute to the Community more than it receives. 
  [De Sousa] Do you believe so? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not think it is necessary to discuss the 
matter at this time, but if we are going to broach this problem 
in greater detail, what matters most is agriculture. We have 
problems with agriculture different from those occurring today 
in the EU. Our system of organization of agriculture is 
relatively liberal, and we would like to liberalize it to a 
level similar to that of industry -- that is, eliminate all 
kinds of subsidies and grants -- and we hope that with our 
joining the EU we will not have to change this. We hope that 
agriculture, as it currently exists in the EU, will tend more 
toward a market system. 
  [De Sousa] At what date do you hope formally to apply for 
EU membership? 
  [Zieleniec] We deem it important to send no wrong signals. 
What matters is that, above all, our country's citizens should 
know that the most important thing is not the date of the 
membership application but knowing how and how quickly we will 
be able to transform this country. 
  [De Sousa] And when do you hope for actual membership? 
There is talk of 2010.... 
  [Zieleniec] I believe this is all linked to a whole general 
view for central and eastern Europe. Those who visit our 
country soon acknowledge that it will in no way be a further 
burden for the EU. 
  [De Sousa] It has been stated that the reason for joining 
has to do with the desire to move closer to a Europe with which 
this country has historical ties, but is there not also a 
security concern, in order to provide against any form of 
instability in Russia? 
  [Zieleniec] I believe that if there is democracy and a 
market economy system in Russia, we will have nothing to fear. 
If there is none of that, you, too, will have to be be afraid. 
  [De Sousa] But in the event of a problem, the Czech Republic 
will be geographically closer to Russia. The perception abroad 
is that the countries of this region are seeking to move closer 
to the West in order to feel more secure.... 
  [Zieleniec] I do not believe that there is a particularly 
acute danger right now. Of course, in the medium and long-term 
perspective, it is important to know how this part of the 
continent will be organized. That is natural, but it is not 
good to analyze these matters from the viewpoint of the past. 
Europe was divided by conventional weapons during World War II, 
with the involvement of infantry and tanks -- not through 
nuclear missiles. All the developments today have other 
technical conditions. I do not believe that it is possible now 
to introduce the simple geometry of the forties into this 
problem. I can guarantee that an unstable and aggressive Russia 
represents a danger both for us and for the rest of the 
continent. That is why we are rooting so much for the Russian 
democrats and hoping that they will succeed in achieving what 
they want. 
  [De Sousa] Is there a Zhirinovskiy factor? Do you believe 
he is a danger? 
  [Zieleniec] Zhirinovskiy as a man, no, but the 26 percent of 
the votes which he won, yes. Where there is no political 
stability, where there are economic problems, political forces 
tend to adopt extreme stances. Hence the importance of 
political and economic stability in Russia. 
  [De Sousa] In light of that observation, do you believe that 
the Czech Republic will be more secure if it moves closer to the 
West? 
  [Zieleniec] Yes, of course, but we are already very close. 
  [De Sousa] How do you interpret the Partnership for Peace 
which you have now signed with NATO? Do you believe it is 
sufficient for your aspirations? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not know what you mean by "sufficient." It 
is natural that we would like to belong to the Atlantic 
alliance, because we feel that it contains countries with the 
same values that we uphold. The Partnership for Peace is not 
the alliance, but it is an area created in order to cooperate 
together. Of course we welcome this opportunity, and we will 
very actively take advantage of all the possibilities that it 
offers. 
  [De Sousa] But the final aim is to join NATO.... 
  [Zieleniec] That is clear. 
  [De Sousa] Let us talk a little now about the Czech 
Republic's evolution following the separation from Slovakia. 
What has economic and political life in this country been like 
in this new situation? 
  [Zieleniec] I do not think it is possible to make a 
comparison in those terms. Some problems, such as the constant 
arguments with Slovakia over the form of organization of the 
state, have disappeared. We have succeeded in establishing a 
stable parliament and government, and we have a well directed 
economic reform which is accepted by the overwhelming majority 
of our population. Political and economic stability is also 
extremely important from the viewpoint of cooperation with other 
countries. 
  We note considerable interest on the part of foreign 
investors, who can find considerable potential here. We have a 
large foreign trade surplus, and in the balance of payments we 
have sufficient currency reserves. 
  Our unemployment rate is just 3 percent. Our currency's 
exchange rate is stable, having hardly fluctuated in the past 
four years. And these are all signs of an economic boom and 
also a good basis for the favorable development of the whole of 
society. 
  [De Sousa] What is the current relationship between the 
Czech Republic and Slovakia? Are they friendly relations? 
  [Zieleniec] This whole process has been very painful for us, 
because from the psychological viewpoint it is very difficult 
for us to accustom ourselves to the idea that a state is 
dividing. We therefore adopted a pragmatic attitude and did 
what was necessary at the time. We sat down at the same table 
and discussed dozens and dozens of agreements. We can now say 
that there are reciprocal agreements between the two countries 
governing all aspects of our lives. There are no problems for 
the population. They can travel freely. They can live in 
either country; the problems of hiring, insurance, and social 
welfare have been resolved. A customs union has been set up. I 
am convinced that resolving all these problems created the basis 
for the whole process' success. When I look back, I can say 
that it was almost a miracle to have succeeded in maintaining 
the friendly relations which exist between us, despite this very 
confused and painful situation. Of course there are still some 
problems, which I hope will be resolved, but I am convinced that 
we will resolve them as we have resolved all the others. 
Relations, both between the two states and between the two 
nations, remain friendly, and we are very pleased that this has 
been achieved.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 2 -- The government of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia on Thursday instructed its Foreign 
Ministry to renew proposals to Albania for dialogue at the level 
of foreign ministers, the Foreign Ministry in Belgrade 
announced. So far Albania has rejected both dialogue at the 
ministerial level and bilateral contacts of the two countries' 
experts, even in spheres such as environmental issues. 
  Albania supports the separatist ethnic Albanian movement in 
Serbia's Kosovo province whose leaders have illegally proclaimed 
the "Kosovo Republic" and advocate its secession from Serbia and 
Yugoslavia and annexation with Albania. Albania is the only 
country to recognize the "Kosovo Republic."

  [Excerpt] Belgrade, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia has joined a small number of countries 
manufacturing tank laser range-finders. They are produced from 
local components and using state-of-the-art scientific and 
technical methods, Dr. Radovan Antanasijevic of the Zemun 
Physics Institute has said. 
  Dr. Antanasijevic, director of the center for applied 
Physics 
at the Zemun Institute, told a TANJUG correspondent that the 
Institute has developed and manufactured the tank laser 
range-finder within less than a year, despite the shortage of 
documentation and equipment. 
  The laser range-finder is a complex optical electronic 
system, used as part of modern combat equipment for defining the 
distance of the target quickly and with precision. The 
probability of hitting the target at first attempt is over 70 
percent, due to the application of laser and other 
state-of-the-art range measuring and information processing 
systems. 
  The range-finder produced in Yugoslavia measures distances 
of 
up to 10,000 meters, with an error margin of five meters.

    [Editorial Report] In articles published under the rubric 
"Fate of the Avram" in the 2 and 9 May issues of the Belgrade 
opposition news weekly VREME, journalist Zoran Jelicic examines 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's economic stabilization 
program, which was introduced in January 1994. Jelicic expresses 
concern that the stable dinar, which is pegged to the German 
mark and is a key element of the program, may not survive the 
inflationary pressures of the second phase of the economic 
recovery program and its plans for state support for key 
industries. (The stable dinar is nicknamed "Avram" after Bank 
Governor Dragoslav Avramovic, author of the stabilization 
program.) In addition, Jelicic charges that the Serbian 
Government's plan to establish coordinating groups for economic 
recovery which will be responsible to a Central Coordinating 
Team (CKT) is reminiscent of the central-planning, command 
economy of the post World War II era. 
<H5>  Inflationary Pressures </H5>
  In the 2 May article, titled "The Conception of Inflation," 
Jelicic argues that the contents of the second phase of the 
Program for the Recovery of the Yugoslav Economy introduced in 
early May make it possible to predict "more or less accurately" 
whether the dinar will remain stable or whether its "quiet 
erosion" will begin. Jelicic recalls that there was disagreement 
within the government over adoption of the "Avramovic Program" 
in late 1993: The word of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
was decisive in adopting the stability program, Jelicic writes, 
while most of those involved in the decision, including Federal 
Prime Minister Radoje Kontic and the majority of economists in 
Serbia, viewed hyperinflation as unavoidable as long as the war 
and sanctions lasted and favored a solution that would provide 
state "support for the most important sectors, from the army to 
medicine." Since January, however, the success of the Avramovic 
program and the stable dinar policy -- the disappearance of "any 
inflation whatsoever" on 24 January, maintenance of the 
dinar-mark parity for the most part, and increase of the state's 
hard currency reserves by 299 million marks -- and the resulting 
"rapid influx of money into empty state coffers," Jelicic 
writes, has "choked off disagreements on basic concepts" and 
shifted discussion to the "second phase of the economic 
stabliization program, `economic revival.'" 
  Judging from what has "leaked" to the public so far, Jelicic 
concludes, what the Federal Government has prepared points 
toward increased state spending. "Stimulus measures and more 
stimulus measures" have been announced for those producers "in 
which a state interest is ackowledged" and once again the 
economy is being divided into "essential and nonessential 
parts." Moreover, elements of a "policy of controlled prices" 
are beginning to appear, not only for individual products or 
services but for production factors (the cost of capital and 
labor), and commercial banks are being "leaned on to secure 
`necessary' means for clients," again for the "sake of reviving 
production, and so forth." 
  Jelicic contrasts recent statements by key officials on the 
government's approach. A recent Avramovic statement that a 
"healthy national currency is the best basis for economic 
expansion," Jelicic says, means that economic expansion is 
possible "only where there is no `revival' of monetary emissions 
without backing." Nevertheless, Jelicic points out, two vice 
presidents responsible for coordinating implementation of the 
recovery program -- Dragan Tomic of the Serbian Government (who 
is also minister without portfolio in the Federal Government) 
and Nikola Sainovic of the Federal Government -- were cited in 
daily newspapers as advocating increased state support during a 
recent visit to the Serbian industrial city of Kragujevac. Tomic 
reportedly stated that the government was "in a major offensive 
to stoke up the economy" and that "it goes without saying that 
we will support those who produce." Sainovic, saying that he 
"supported monetary stability," at the same time added: "We are 
in favor of the spirit of free market competition under the 
conditions of the sanctions, with special reference to those 
collectives in which the sanctions have caused especially 
negative consequences." Jelicic also cites newspaper reports 
that the Federal Government will draft a "special program" to 
increase the use of "`special-purpose' (weapons) production 
capacities." Jelicic implies that the Zastava firm in Kragujevac 
is a potential candidate, since its civilian sector will 
probably produce only 20,000 automobiles this year, thus 
operating at only 10 percent of its capacity. 
  Jelicic cites other evidence of pressure for state 
intervention, pointing out that Tomic -- longtime director of 
the Simpo firm in Vranje, a major manufacturer and distributor 
of furniture and other household products, and a member of the 
board of governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia -- has 
been best known for organizing regular weekly roundtables on 
state television that bring together representatives of various 
economic sectors to uncover ways to revive production "through 
mutual aid, but also with government aid." In one such 
discussion, Jelicic adds, an enterprise director said "with 
complete candor" that he was looking forward to the completion 
of the state budgets because "this would make possible more 
money and more work for his company." In short, Jelicic 
observes, the picture is very reminiscent of the early 
post-World War II era when Edvard Kardelj was in charge of 
economic policy or, "more precisely, of all times when, under 
various names, an economy without a sound currency was created." 
<H5>  Role of Coordinating Teams </H5>
  In his 9 May article, titled "The CKT as the CK [Central 
Committee]," Jelicic focuses on the proposed organizational 
structure of the recovery program -- drafted in the office of 
Dragan Tomic -- and warns that under this plan, the Serbian 
economy will find itself under an administration reminiscent of 
the state administrative-operational leaderships (AOR) of the 
central- planning, command-economy era of the late 1940's and 
early 1950's. The only differences, he says, would be in the 
name -- at that time the AOR's and today the SKT's (special 
coordinating teams) -- and in the fact that the SKT's, unlike 
the AOR's, are not subordinated to a ministry, but to the CKT, 
the "organizational center" for implementing the recovery 
program. 
  Describing the structure of the Operational Program, Jelicic 
presents an organizational diagram "drawn up by Dragan Tomic" 
which shows that the CKT is responsible directly to the Serbian 
Government and that SKT's for "branches of production" are 
subordinate to the CKT. The diagram explains everything, Jelicic 
states, warning that "one should not examine it superficially or 
interpret it lightly." The "center of centers," he says, is 
Dragan Tomic, the Serbian minister "responsible for coordinating 
the implementation of the Avramovic economic stabilization 
plan." Next in the hierarchy, within the CKT, are the 
"magnificent seven," identified by the plan as "the most 
competent specialists," who are ready to provide the 
prerequisites for the successful implementation of the recovery 
program. Other economic players in the republic -- regional and 
local governments, commercial banks, unions, scientific 
institutes, and production enterprises (companies) -- are also 
subordinate to the CKT, either directly or through the SKT's. 
Jelicic observes that enterprises are found at the bottom of the 
organizational diagram, several layers removed from the CKT, and 
that "judging by the diagram," the Serbian Government went as 
far as possible to "humiliate enterprises and businessmen." 
  The "main task" of the CKT, Jelicic writes, is to form 
specialized teams in production, trade, and the banking system 
and to establish a specialized bank or consortium of banks that 
will provide "indispensable financial support to carry out 
concrete plans of the economic recovery program." The basic task 
of the SKT's is to "implement the general policy and directives 
of the central team," and, within this framework, to draft and 
carry out their own operating plans. Another major duty of the 
SKT's, according to the plan, is to inform the public once a 
month "via special television programs and other means of 
information about the results of the recovery of production in 
various economic sectors on the basis of benchmarks for the 
successful implementation of the program (volume of production, 
number of enterprises rehabilitated, number of productive new 
employees, and so forth), as well as about planned measures and 
activities." 
  Subordinate to the SKT's are management teams, Jelicic says, 
noting that "their task is easier" because they do not have to 
report to the public, but only to those to whom they are 
subordinate, and "managers have been promised that they will be 
given special awards for their work in the form of various types 
of incentives." A footnote in the organizational diagram states 
that members of the management teams are drawn from specialists 
from "successful enterprises, chambers, institutes, faculties, 
and elsewhere." The management teams oversee "enterprises that 
are being given direct assistance to improve production." 
<H5>  Avramovic Defends Organizational Plan </H5>
  According to statements made in an interview aired 11 May on 
the Belgrade RTB Television Network, Dragoslav Avramovic 
apparently does not share Jelicic's apprehension about the fate 
of the currency nicknamed for him. Asked to comment on Tomic's 
plan to form coordinating groups for the recovery of the 
economy, Avramovic replied: "Well, this is an extraordinary 
initiative. We have been thinking about it, but not in terms of 
such concentrated and extensive efforts as he has undertaken. We 
expect all the best from it, as the key to our future recovery 
lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big 
companies. There could not have been a better initiative than 
the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care 
of the revival of production, further investments, and the 
resolution of all problems that some of our companies face."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Positive economic trends have given rise 
to optimism in government and business circles in the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. The Belgrade press agency TANJUG 
reported on 17 May that industrial output has been "steadily" 
increasing since the beginning of the year, the market is 
"reasonably" well supplied, the national currency, the dinar, is 
"completely" stable, foreign currency reserves have grown, and 
budget deficits are decreasing. 
  Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia and the architect of the economic recovery program, 
stated in an interview published in the 17 May issue of the 
Ljubljana weekly MLADINA that his program enjoys "wide" public 
support. He boasted that Yugoslavia had even accumulated a trade 
surplus in spite of the sanctions and that the "international 
financial police" has so far been unable to prevent it from 
doing so. "In the Balkans, smugglers have really mastered their 
trade," he told MLADINA, explaining that Serbian wine can be 
bought in the United States, Switzerland, and Germany. A shoe 
factory in Kraljevo, he said, is working "full steam" for the 
Italian market, and "planeloads" of money are being sent from 
Belgrade. Avramovic invited the reporter to the Belgrade 
railroad station to see 20-car trains loaded with furniture 
departing every day. After all, he concluded, "UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] itself is a huge smuggling operation," 
pointing out that each soldier in the newly arrived Russian 
contingent "will leave Yugoslavia with a good car." 
  Avramovic is convinced that sanctions against Yugoslavia 
"must fail," although he conceded that the country is paying a 
heavy price to circumvent them: It is paying 30 to 40 percent 
above world market prices for its imports while its exports sell 
for 30 to 40 percent below market prices. He is also concerned 
by shortages of petroleum and drugs. On the other hand, 
Avramovic said he is comforted by the fact that "the country can 
feed itself well," a "capable" light-industry sector, and a 
strong armaments industry. 
  Similarly, the 16 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA 
cited 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as telling U.S. journalists 
that "sanctions cannot do us any harm even if they last another 
thousand years." The same issue of BORBA carried a report on the 
opening of an agricultural fair in Novi Sad at which Federal 
Prime Minister Radoje Kontic recognized food producers and 
farmers "who not only managed to survive under the blockade but 
continued to work and share a major burden in the implementation 
of the stabilization program." After touring the agricultural 
fair, Milosevic also praised the accomplishments of Serbian 
farmers and declared Serbia an "agricultural and agroindustrial 
power," TANJUG reported on 20 May. 
  In a statement to Radio Moscow reported by the 18 May BORBA, 
Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said that "although 
sanctions have had a serious economic and social impact, they 
have neither politically destabilized the country nor made us 
sway from our principled policy." Addressing the participants of 
the International Conference of Journalists in Belgrade, 
Marjanovic recounted the effects of sanctions on the economy, 
estimating the damage at $30-40 billion. Nevertheless, he 
stressed the positive results of the economic recovery program, 
according to the 24 May TANJUG report. 
  A monthly opinion poll conducted by the Belgrade-based 
Market 
Research Institute showed growing optimism among Yugoslav 
businessmen, TANJUG reported on 25 May. According to the poll, 
63 percent of businessmen expect industrial growth to continue 
during the next six months. In a similar poll conducted a year 
earlier, TANJUG states, 60 percent of those surveyed expected a 
sharp fall in production. Sixty-four percent of respondents in 
the recent poll expect the business climate to improve over the 
next six months, compared to 31 percent of respondents to a poll 
taken in January. However, the TANJUG report notes, "experts" 
warn that an increase in industrial production might create 
problems, since low wages have weakened consumers' purchasing 
power to the point that "the population is struggling at the 
subsistence level" at the same time that UN sanctions are 
preventing exports.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 2 (TANJUG) -- The Serbian Academy of 
Arts and Sciences (SANU) warned Thursday of a dramatic 
deterioration in the demographic structure of the Yugoslav 
republic of Serbia which has a population of ten million. 
  Population experts say this is the result of a continuing 
drop in the birth rate and economic and social difficulties 
caused by the violent break-up of the former Yugoslav federation 
and the current international blockade of the new Yugoslav state 
which comprises the republics of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  The situation is especially dramatic in central Serbia and 
in 
the northern province of Vojvodina, which both have a negative 
birth rate. In the southern province Kosovo, on the other hand, 
the majority ethnic Albanian population has had a very high 
population growth for years. 
  The decrease in the birth rate of the Serb population in the 
breakaway Yugoslav republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, 
whose Croat and Moslem population does not encounter these 
difficulties, further aggravates the problem. 
  In Serbia, the major drop in the birth rate has been 
followed 
by what demographic experts describe as depopulation. This is a 
situation in which many young people leave the country, in which 
there are major migrations, resettlement of populations because 
of war and exposure to psychological and social stress. 
  All these factors have long-term negative effects on the 
biological reproduction of the population, population growth and 
the future of the Serb people, as well as on the psychological 
and genetic health of the new generations. 
  Experts say the roots of the problem are the unfavourable 
financial situation which does not allow families to have more 
children, unawareness of the dramatic proportions of the 
situation, social and economic measures which discriminate 
against families with children, and a low level of family 
planning activities where abortion seems to be the most popular 
birth control method. 
  The tendency of the dropping population growth in Serbia has 
been noted since the end of the Second World War. Negative 
population growth has been registered in 105 of 189 
municipalities in Serbia, according to data from 1991. 
  Municipalities with the highest population growth are always 
the ones with a majority ethnic Albanian or Moslem population. 
Not a single municipality in Kosovo has registered a negative 
population growth and even municipalities with a majority 
Serbian population have registered a population growth in this 
area. Population experts predict that by the year 2,050 almost a 
third of the total population of central Serbia and Vojvodina 
will be lost in relation to 1991. Serbia will have a population 
of 4.1 and Vojvodina of 1.4 million. Montenegro's population 
will be 600,00, a 10 per cent drop. 
  At the same time the population in Kosovo will reach 3.64 
million, population say. [sentence as received]

  The president of the most numerous Montenegrin opposition

<F P=106> [Article by Luko Brailo: "Montenegro Without `Black Gold'"] </F>
  [Text] Regarding the power industry, Montenegro has 
demanded that the joint state function on the federal principle 
-- that is, that Yugoslav oil and petroleum products be divided 
between both republics according to their needs and not just 
given to one republic. Yugoslav oil practically belongs to just 
Serbia, as it is produced only in Serbia -- Vojvodina -- so all 
products have previously ended up exclusively in Serbia. As the 
production in Serbia (in addition to stealing Croatian oil from 
Djeletovci) is considered Yugoslav in the federal balance of 
energy supply and consumption, the Montenegrins hold that this 
Yugoslav production must be divided as such. 
  "Montenegro did not get a single drop of oil or any other 
energy product from the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption, so the Government of Montenegro has reiterated the 
demand for solving the problem, which was presented to the 
Federal Executive Council a long time ago," said Montenegrin 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Miodrag Gomilanovic, 
Montenegrin minister of power industry, says that the situation 
regarding oil and petroleum products threatens to block the 
economy and lives since all reserves on all levels have been 
exhausted. He added: "We demand joint criteria for the 
distribution of oil -- that is, a priority list. The so-called 
first priority group should have the same criteria for consumers 
in Serbia and Montenegro." 
<H5>  Petrol Stations Instead of Pillboxes </H5>
  It is obvious that the federal Yugoslav balance of energy 
supply and consumption exists only on paper and is applied 
solely to priority consumers in Serbia following the old saying: 
"Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin." In other words, all 
petroleum products in "the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]" 
are produced by the "Serbian Oil Industry of Nis" and it is all 
distributed to priority consumers, except for some symbolic 
amounts for free sale, by the republic (Serbian) emergency 
committee. The so-called federal committee is only informed 
about the amount that is to be divided by the Serbian republic 
committee. Montenegro, therefore, requested (demanded) the 
right to buy a certain percentage of total production on the 
basis of former consumption ratio. 
  And while "the shirt and the skin" are not being treated as 
equal, Kotor "Jugopetrol" published the information according to 
which three metric tons of gasoline and eight tons of diesel are 
being delivered to the Montenegrin market daily, so that the 
present monthly balance of Montenegro amounts to approximately 
100 tons of gasoline and 250 tons of diesel. However, priority 
consumers need about 300 tons of gasoline and 1,800 tons of 
diesel. 
  The amount needed is acquired on the black market under the 
auspices of the state. For example, it is an open secret that, 
at the Bozaj border crossing toward Albania, Montenegrin customs 
officers charge one dinar per liter of gasoline to truck drivers 
whose trucks have additional, so-called expanded fuel tanks. 
Indeed, it is only done a couple of days each month, while 
"expanded fuel tanks" are usually tolerated the rest of the 
month. Otherwise, oil and gasoline are most often transported 
illegally by water, especially across Lake Skadar, which forms 
most of the borderline between Montenegro and Albania. Oil 
fever has spread to villages on both sides of the lake. In "the 
land of eagles," gas stations are being built along the borders, 
replacing the string of pillboxes. Researching those oil roads, 
correspondents of the Montenegrin independent weekly MONITOR 
found out that about 200 boats cross the imaginary borderline 
between Montenegro and Albania every day. The boats are used 
for smuggling everything from cigarettes to satellite dishes, 
but mostly for oil and gasoline. The profitability of the 
entire operation is substantiated by the following data: The 
Albanians are paid 0.7 German marks [DM] per liter of oil, which 
is later sold for DM1.2 -- the equivalent amount in Avramovic's 
dinars. Consequently, the profit is about half a German mark 
per liter, but since the state takes 70 percent of that, 
black-marketeers are left with about DM30 (dinars) per barrel. 
(It has become customary in these transactions to use standard 
"Skadar barrels," which contain 210 liters each.) In this case, 
a recently founded firm "Transport" of Podgorica presents a kind 
of authority, according to MONITOR, as it issues permits for 
black-marketing on behalf of the Government of Montenegro. Just 
as every other official document, that permit has serial number, 
name, surname, and photograph of the person to which it is 
issued. Black-marketeers point out that, on the arrival to the 
Montenegrin side of the lake, they can only deliver oil to 
certain authorized persons, otherwise the permit "is gone." The 
permit means so much, among other reasons, because its holders 
enjoy the protection of both the police and the army. 
  The busiest spot on the Montenegrin side of Lake Skadar is 
at the "Plavnica" motel. The former favorite weekend resort of 
Podgorica inhabitants, which, in the past couple of years, has 
been more frequently closed than open, has taken on a new life 
thanks to oil. The motel was leased for DM1,200 per month. The 
lessee rigged up a wharf and every cistern's approach to the 
so-called loading pad is charged DM200. Motel "Plavnica" also 
has an entertainment program featuring Russian strippers. As 
many as 10 cisterns with Serb and Bosnian license plates are 
filled up here every day. Some of them belong to a Belgrade 
firm "Pizon," whose owner is famous former soccer player for 
"Zvezda" [Belgrade soccer team] Vladimir Petrovic Pizon. Oil is 
being smuggled on the Bojana River, which connects Lake Skadar 
with the sea, as well as in Ulcinj, by means of a specially 
designed raft cistern that is towed by boat along the sea border 
between Montenegro and Albania. 
<H5>  Plastic Tube at the Bottom of the Bojana </H5>
  However, the oil warehouse at Plavnica has recently burned 
down. Some five acres of land was burned then, two cisterns, 
several hundred tons of oil, a dozen cars, and two tractors were 
destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Soon after 
that, the Albanian police, in collaboration with the World 
Organization of Customs Officers, discovered a plastic tube at 
the bottom of the Bojana River that was used to carry oil from 
Albania to Montenegro. The Ulcinj connection was also 
"unearthed." All those events, just as the recent confiscation 
of a tanker transporting oil for Montenegro, which was 
redirected to Brindisi by NATO and Western European Union 
forces, indicate that the "Skadar connection" is slowly running 
dry. Among others, the Albanian police have also been 
instructed by the international community and organizations that 
supervise the embargo imposed on "the FRY" to cover the entire 
area of Skadar and prevent further black-marketing of oil. It 
is an open secret that Montenegrin and Albanian black-marketeers 
have easily found a common ground in the business, and we must 
point out that every black-marketeer caught on the Albanian side 
had to pay a fine of DM10. 
  Those relations were soon strained as a result of the 
mentioned haggling over the federal balance of energy supply and 
consumption between Serbia and Montenegro, and there is no doubt 
that Montenegro will be getting the worst of it for a while. 
And so, the Belgrade economic circles will again start working 
on "dividing Yugoslav petroleum products from Serbia," but 
according to the already known principle. In other words, 
Montenegro should offer a certain amount of money to be used for 
research and production "of the very Yugoslav oil in Vojvodina." 
The thesis says that at least one part of the Montenegrin 
tourist pie will have to end up in the oil fields of Vojvodina, 
for it is senseless to demand federal rights without accepting 
federal obligations. Alleged equal status of Montenegro in the 
joint federal state is, therefore, still an ideal and the cry of 
Milo Djukanovic, one of the architects of "Zabljak Yugoslavia," 
[the meeting in Zabljak was held to confirm the preservation of 
Yugoslavia] does indeed seem grotesque. Oil problems are just 
the tip of the iceberg of the "joint" economy. The Serbian idea 
of a joint market is described by the case of importing 50,000 
tons of salt for the needs of Serbia. Meanwhile, there are more 
than 35,000 of tons of salt at the Ulcinj salt-works, so the 
amount of unsold salt threatens to have serious repercussions on 
the harvest this year.... In a nutshell, Montenegro is 
suffocating more and more every day.

<F P=106> [Interview with Iljaz Ramajli, chairman of the assembly of </F>
the republic of Kosova, by E. Azemi; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Azemi] The old structure of the assembly of Kosova 
is in exile. In the meantime, there have been multiparty 
elections for the assembly and president of the republic of 
Kosova. The new assembly has not been formed yet. How do you 
explain this situation? 
  [Ramajli] As you said, multiparty elections in the republic 
of Kosova were held on 24 May 1992. In those elections, in which 
there was a massive turnout of citizens of the republic of 
Kosova, the president of the republic of Kosova and the deputies 
of the new multiparty parliament were voted for and elected. On 
the basis of constitutional provisions, the president of the 
republic of Kosova took office, in a legitimate manner, five 
days after the elections, while the formation of the new 
parliament was supposed to take place on 24 June of the same 
year. For well-known reasons, the formation of the parliament 
did not take place on that date and it has not taken place yet. 
  During this time many preparations have been made for the 
formation of the new parliament but conditions and circumstances 
have not been created for doing this or for radically changing 
the situation in Kosova, that is, so that it will not lead to 
open conflict in Kosova. On the basis of information available 
to me, many of our friends from abroad have suggested that the 
holding of the constitutive assembly for the parliament should 
be postponed so that the situation in Kosova can be kept under 
control and so that conditions can be created for starting the 
discussions. 
  In my opinion, it is not good that we have not formed a new 
parliament. However, we should have no doubt that we have 
assured the continuity of action of the organs of power in the 
republic of Kosova through the institution of the president of 
the republic, who is legitimately carrying out his function on 
the basis of constitutional provisions, through the activity of 
the government and other organs of authority in Kosova which are 
operating in many fields, wherever present conditions and 
circumstances permit. From the formal constitutional and legal 
viewpoint, this structure of the assembly, which I head, covers 
the time up to the formation of the new assembly. However, the 
new composition of deputies of the parliament of Kosova has 
exclusive legitimacy to meet on and to decide any issue which is 
in the sphere of the assembly's activity. 
  I understand the concern of many people that the failure to 
form a parliament might cause us some damage! I believe that the 
many comments that various individuals have made in regard to 
this matter are well-intentioned; however, during their 
political appearances, each person must be careful about what 
they say, since any doubts about the legitimacy and legality of 
the multiparty elections in Kosova, even if these criticisms are 
unintentional, could pave the way for manipulations which our 
adversary could use to attack the legitimacy of the 
representatives whom the people of Kosova elected, with the aim 
of diminishing their position in any future discussions on the 
resolution of the issue of Kosova and its status. 
  [Azemi] It is almost four years since the proclamation of 
the Constitution of Kacanik. This high-level legal act had a 
profound influence on the political processes in Kosova since, 
on the basis of this, a parallel system of education, health, 
and social insurance was set up. It is possible that this system 
will be extended ever further and that we will develop other 
forms of institutional activity. 
  [Ramajli] After the proclamation of the republic of Kosova 
and the promulgation of the Constitution of Kacanik on September 
1990, the state organs of the republic of Kosova were 
restructured and their activity was adapted to constitutional 
provisions. The organization of these organs, from the 
government of the republic down to the communal organs, was 
adapted to the conditions and circumstances which exist in 
Kosova. The field of education has been better organized, with 
broader dimensions. In addition to carrying out its basic 
function, education has been one of the most prominent forms of 
resistance to the Serbian occupational authorities, and it is 
also highly regarded by the outside world. In addition, the 
fields of health, finance, culture, sports, social, assistance, 
and other areas have been organized to a certain extent. 
  I think that the results achieved in these areas are not 
satisfactory and that we have not done all that we could in all 
spheres of life in Kosova, in light of the fact that the 
citizens of Kosova and the organs of the republic of Kosova live 
and operate in conditions of total occupation and in the 
presence of the application of unprecedented police and military 
violence by the Serbian authorities. I think that this work 
should be continued in those areas which we have not organized 
well so far. We must take action in the judiciary so that a 
judicial system, as conditions and circumstances allow, will be 
put in place. In my opinion, a vital, priority issues is the 
preservation and expansion of institutional activity in Kosova 
so that we can show that we are able to organize life in Kosova, 
despite the situation of occupation which we have there. On the 
other hand, I am deeply convinced that will win more respect 
from the outside world if we develop forms of institutional 
activity. 
  [Azemi] Sensitivities are being raised in regard to the 
internationalization of the issue of Kosova. This matter has 
also been discussed in some important documents. On the other 
hand, the situation in Kosova remains the same. Has the fact 
that they are talking about Kosova in the world made any 
impression on the Serbian aggressor? 
  [Ramajli] It is true that the issue of Kosova, expecially 
recently, is discussed at every meeting of the international 
community and, one might say, it is present in every public 
appearance of every statesman. This is understandable in light 
of the fact that it is clear to all that, without the resolution 
of the issue of Kosova, there is no solution to the problem of 
the former Yugoslavia and there is no peace in the Balkans. The 
international community is currently concerned with the Kosova 
issue for the purpose of making it impossible for the conflict 
to spread from the territory of Croatia and Bosnia to the south. 
It is clear to all now that the conflict in Kosova cannot be 
kept under control within a certain territory, as is the case 
with the conflict in Bosnia and Croatia. This conflict would 
immediately involve many other states bordering on Kosova and 
the conflict would be expanded in the Balkans and perhaps even 
further. Since the European Union and the international 
community are not interested is seeing the conflict expand, 
these groups have recently been bringing up the Kosova issue as 
a problem which demands an immediate solution so that it will 
not get any worse. 
  Much pressure is being exerted on Serbia to begin to resolve 
the Kosova issue by means of discussions with the Albanians, and 
it appears that this pressure has begun to produce its first 
effects. This is evident in the fact that there are signs which 
indicate that the current Serbian government wants to begin the 
talks, under conditions and at a time when they will receive the 
best response. The activity of the government organs in Kosova, 
which rely exclusively on military police violence, gives the 
impression, as you say, that the international pressure in 
regard to Kosova is not making any impression on Serbia. In my 
opinion, this is not true; this attitude and the nervousness of 
this government give the impression that Serbia is not in a 
strong position in regard to Kosova and it believes that it will 
not be easy to keep Kosova under occupation for a long time. 
  There are other indications that the Serbs are calculating 
that they might be losing Kosova in the near future. This is 
seen, best of all, in the schemes that are being devised in 
regard to Serbian Krajina in Croatia and the insistence that 
there is a parallel between that area and Kosova. Now we also 
have the public appearances of many Serbian intellectuals, which 
were not characteristic earlier, who now are talking, without 
hesitation, about Kosova as a lost territory for Serbia and 
about the fact that it is better that this be understood now 
instead of becoming true by means of a conflict which certainly 
would be more fierce and more bloody than the one in Croatia and 
Bosnia. 
  [Azemi] Recently there has been talk about some kind of 
global plan for the solution of the problem of the former 
Yugoslavia. Some people quickly called this plan very hopeful 
while others expressed some skepticism about the resolution of 
the issue of Kosova. 
  [Ramajli] Yes, it is true that there is talk about some kind 
of global plan for the solution of the problem of the former 
Yugoslavia. But I think that, despite the many preparations 
which are being made by the international community for such a 
plan, conditions have not yet been created for this plan to be 
put on the table for discussion. In my opinion, a precondition 
for beginning discussions of this plan would be the achievement 
of a cease-fire in Bosnia which would end the armed conflicts. 
If this is not achieved, it would be difficult to have 
discussions on this plan. I think that the position of Kosova 
regarding this plan has its good and bad aspects. It would be a 
positive development if Kosova were included in this plan by 
taking our position into consideration; Kosova, according to the 
1974 Constitution, has been a constituent part of the former 
Yugoslavia. In my opinion, a negative element would be the fact 
that there is no doubt that this plan would try to draw a 
parallel between Kosova and the Serbian Krajina in Croatia, 
something which, basically, is not suitable for us. The drawing 
of this parallel must be opposed to the very end. 
  In any case, although we have opted for the solution of the 
problem of Kosova by means of discussions in the presence of an 
international factor, which would guarantee the agreements 
reached with the other side, the inclusion of Kosova in the 
global plan for the solution of the problem of the former 
Yugoslavia would satisfy, to some extent, our requirements in 
regard to the size of the presence of the international factor 
and the solution of the problem of Kosova; it would also rule 
out the possibility that the Albanians would meet only with the 
Serbs, which would mean that the issue of Kosova would not be 
internationalized and would be regarded as an internal problem 
of Serbia. 
  [Azemi] There is much talk in the media about a possible 
Albanian-Serbian dialogue. Some diplomats who visited Kosova 
recently talked about this possibility. On the other hand, 
president Rugova denied that a group had been formed to discuss 
the issues. Indeed, when would this dialogue be possible and 
under what conditions? 
  [Ramajli] In response to an earlier question, I stressed 
that there are signals that the Serbs would like to begin 
discussions with the Albanians about the solution of the problem 
of Kosova. They are doing this because of pressure from the 
international community and because of the situation which 
currently exists within Serbia. These signals, as you have said, 
have been given recently through various diplomatic channels and 
on the occasion of visits of foreign diplomats to Kosova. The 
clearest signal was given on the occasion of the visit of 
British Secretary Hogg to Prishtina. Other signals were given 
through the media from Belgrade. 
  I consider the talk about the formation of a group for 
discussions in Serbia with the Albanians, which president Rugova 
denied, as preparing the terrain for discussions and preparing 
opinion within Serbia for something which must happen soon. As 
president Rugova said, there has been no official announcement 
from the Serbian government about the beginning of the 
discussions or the formation of groups by one or the other side. 
The Albanian side has already proclaimed the conditions in which 
the discussions will begin and they have been the same and 
unchangeable from the very beginning. I think that the Serbian 
side is not yet prepared for this dialogue and that the dialogue 
will begin when the Serbian side believes that the conditions 
and the time are most appropriate for this. However, it appears 
that the dialogue on Kosova will more likely be imposed by 
international factors and by the situation in the region than by 
Serbia's readiness for talks. 
  [Azemi] After the democratization of Albania, a new quality 
of relations among Albanians found expression. The appearance of 
Albania in the democratic plane is redefining the attitude of 
international factors toward Kosova. 
  [Ramajli] I agree with your statement. After the 
democratization of life in Albania, especially after the victory 
of the democratic forces in the recent elections, there was a 
qualitative difference in the involvement of Albania in the 
problem of Kosova and of Albanians on the territory of the 
former Yugoslavia. Despite Albania's many domestic and foreign 
problems, the country has been greatly involved in sensitizing 
efforts to place the issue of Kosova on the international agenda 
as a problem which demands a rapid solution, so that it will not 
get any worse. Along with the involvement of the republic of 
Kosova, Albanian diplomacy could be said to be the motivating 
force in sensitizing the international community and raising the 
issue of Kosova in all international mechanisms. 
  The clear position of the president of the Government of 
Albania that Albania cannot stand aside in case of a conflict in 
Kosova obliged the international community to consider the issue 
of Kosova as a serious problem which requires an urgent 
solution. In my opinion, Albania is doing exactly what it can 
do, in accordance with its possibilities, so that the problem of 
Kosova will be resolved in accordance with the interests of the 
Albanians of Kosova. At this time and in the circumstances in 
the international community and in the territories of the former 
Yugoslavia, the support which Albania is giving to Kosova is 
irreplaceable. 
  [Azemi] Kosova is bounded by neighbors which once were 
members of the Yugoslav Federation. One of them is Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Can you 
characterize the Macedonia-Kosova relationship in the current 
circumstances? 
  [Ramajli] Currently, Macedonia, as an independent and 
sovereign state which was part of the former Yugoslavia, despite 
its international acceptance, is confronted by domestic problems 
of the transitional phase and by foreign problems which 
determine its position in regard to Kosova. The situation in 
Kosova and the course of events in regard to Kosova could 
involve Macedonia and other states in this part of the Balkans, 
no matter how they might develop. In my opinion, Macedonia's 
problem with Greece and the failure to accept Macedonia as an 
independent and sovereign state by the so-called third 
Yugoslavia are forcing Macedonia to maintain a neutral official 
attitude on the issue of Kosova. The recent interview by 
Macedonian President Gligorov with a foreign newspaper, in which 
he stressed the need for the installation of peacekeeping forces 
in Kosova so as to eliminate the possibility of an outbreak of a 
conflict in the south, satisfies the demands of the 
representatives of Kosova for such a thing. 
  [Azemi] In your opinion, what is the future of Kosova? 
Concretely, can you state briefly the goals of the organs of 
government in Kosova and other institutions? 
  [Ramajli] The goals of the organs of Kosova, beginning with 
President Rugova, the assembly, the government, and other 
organs, are stated in the documents which this assembly approved 
and which have been put into force by the referendum which was 
held in Kosova in which the citizens of Kosova defined the 
status of Kosova as a sovereign and independent state. 
Therefore, during the present time and in the future, all 
representatives of Kosova and of its organs will be committed to 
the realization of this goal. There has been no wavering from 
this goal on the part of any political party in Kosova or any 
individual who has a relevant influence on public opinion in 
Kosova. I am aware that the road to the achievement of this goal 
is difficult and long but the results will depend on the manner 
of organization and our commitment, first of all, and on the 
support of the international factor. For the achievement of this 
goal, we have chosen the peaceful option and the solution of 
problems by means of discussions which must be carried on, on 
our part, by the legitimate representatives of the citizens of 
the republic of Kosova who were identified by the multiparty 
elections of 24 May 1992.

  [Text] Although Yasushi Akashi, (?special) envoy to the UN 
secretary general, said that Serbian soldiers had withdrawn from 
their positions around Gorazde, the Geneva negotiations on 
general cease-fire on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina have 
not resumed. 
  The spokesman of the Zagreb UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
Command has (?however) stated that UNPROFOR representatives 
registered the withdrawal of Serb aggressor's forces from the 
western bank of the Drina near Gorazde, but that there are still 
no reliable data on whether the withdrawal (?has been 
completed). According to him, a final report should have 
arrived in the Command at about 1100. 
  It has just been reported at the Sarajevo Peace Forces 
Command that the commander of the units of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in Gorazde and the local UNPROFOR commander 
in the town had signed a joint document this morning which 
stresses that all remaining aggressor's policemen and armed 
civilians had left the 3-km zone around Gorazde. This 
announcement was immediately sent to Geneva where political 
negotiations on Bosnia-Herzegovina are expected to resume. We 
have not received any new reports from Geneva during [words 
indistinct]. 
  (Peric Buljubasic), commander of the East-Bosnian Operations 
Group of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
together with the UNPROFOR commander in Gorazde, visited the 
border lines in the exclusion zone and established that the 
chetniks had withdrawn from (?Sjenokosi) and [word indistinct] 
toward [word indistinct]. 
  According to a report by our correspondent in Gorazde, only 
a 
few ethnic Serb civilians have been left in the exclusion zone.

  [Text] Zvornik, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems have 
prepared a plan for the execution of Serbs captured in the area 
of Mt. Ozren in northeastern Bosnia, Bosnian Serb sources have 
told TANJUG. 
  The Bosnian Serb humanitarian aid organisation has apprised 
the International Committee of the Red cross (I.C.R.C.) office 
in Bijeljina about the planned execution of the Serbs captured 
on Mt. Ozren, and appealed to the I.C.R.C. officials to take the 
necessary steps to save the captives' lives. 
  In a letter to the I.C.R.C. office, the Serb humanitarian 
organisation says that Moslem extremists have brutally murdered 
and then mutilated the bodies of large numbers of captured Serbs 
in the course of this war, especially in the areas of Fakovici, 
Kamenica, Kravica near Milic, Brcko and elsewhere in eastern 
Bosnia. 
  In mid-1992, Moslem troops stormed and torched 43 Serb 
villages in eastern Bosnia, massacring 960 Serb civilians, 
mostly old men, women and children. 
  Serbs who have fled Tuzla with Croat help for 
Serb-controlled 
territories testify that the position of their ethnic kin in 
Tuzla is worsening, with the town's Moslem authorities evicting 
them from their homes and taking them away in an unknown 
direction. 
  In fear of their lives, Serbs in Tuzla are taking shelter 
with Croat families in the area, witnesses say.

  [Text] The chetniks are attacking the free Zavidovici 
territories with all means and (?manpower). They started by 
firing infantry and antiaircraft weapons at the defense lines, 
then they attacked (?Boscelovo), Bozici, (Lazanici), and [name

mortar bombs at Hajderevici from (Sunici) and 15 shells at 
Smailbasici from (Paljenici). (?Four) mortar [word indistinct] 
have been constantly pounding the villages of Bresevine and 
Tolici. A sniper is active at (Zebni Vrh). There are motor

  [Text] In the Gracanica Operations Group zone, the chetniks 
are not changing their tactics. They are still taking advantage 
of the night to bring in new manpower reinforcements and to 
[word indistinct] the arsenal of weapons in order to pound our 
defense lines, as well as to [word indistinct] set off into new 
infantry assaults that are successfully repelled by the heroes 
of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Although they failed to cause the slightest disorder or 
disorganization among our fighters, (?yesterday's) missiles, 
which have not been used on this section of the battlefield 
before, show that the chetniks are using their last trump cards 
to [word indistinct] the security zone around Doboj. 
  During the night, in the zone covered by the 109th Doboj 
Brigade and the 111th (?Gracanica) Brigade, apart from activity 
with various weapons of diverse calibers, the chetniks brought 
to the regions of (?Svjetlica), Radic, and [word indistinct] 
dozens of trucks with new chetnik forces and equipment. This 
certainly represents the latest replacement of forces that were 
crushed by our fighters during the chetnik eight-day infantry 
assaults on our defense lines. 
  In the shelling of civilian districts of Klokotica, 
Brijecica, Lukavica, and Lukavica Rijeka, eight people were 
seriously or lightly wounded yesterday, while the material 
damage is huge. 
  As I report, the chetniks are intensively shelling our 
defense lines, which is only a preparation for (?mindless) new 
infantry assaults. The great fighters of the 109th Doboj 
Brigade and the 111th Gracanica Brigade are firmly maintaining 
our defense lines and are determined not to permit chetniks 
[words indistinct].

  [Text] Zvornik, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslems on 
Monday continued their armed operations against the Bosnian Serb 
Republic, in what the Serb Army sees as an obvious attempt to 
jeopardize the convention and outcome of Geneva peace talks. 
  There are no armed Serbs within the 3-km exclusion zone 
around Gorazde, the Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, which the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has also confirmed, Bosnian 
Serb Army sources inform. The Moslems are continuing also to 
violate the ceasefire in the Sarajevo area, attacking from small 
arms the Serb localities of Ilijas, Vogosca, Ilidza, Nedjarici 
and Kasindol Street. 
  On the Ozren front, the Moslems mounted a combined artillery 
and infantry attack on the Serb defence positions on the 
southern slopes of Mt Ozren and in the Srbobran and Komar areas 
in the northeast, TANJUG learns. 
  The Bosnian Croat Army and the army of neighbouring Croatia 
are engaged in provocations along most of the lines of 
separation with Bosnia's Serbs on the Orasje front in the north. 
  Moslem operations against the Serbs are still going strong 
in 
the areas of Doboj, Teslic, Treabava and Vlasic in central 
Bosnia, and the Bihac and Krupa areas in the west. Moslems are 
provoking the Serbs also in the Sava River valley, especially 
around Brcko, which is situated in the neck of a vital corridor 
which links the east and west of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Serb 
Army sources say.
