  [Text] A session of the Presidential Council of Defense and 
National Security was held in the presidential palace today 
under the chairmanship of President Franjo Tudjman. The Council 
discussed the economic and other prerequisites for making the 
kuna a hard currency, the presidential office announced today. 
  Prime Minister Nikica Valentic told the Council that the 
monetary reform in Croatia has been wound up by the introduction 
of a new Croatian currency whose international code is HRK 191. 
The stable and convertible kuna is a prerequisite for the 
further development of the Croatian economy. 
  Valentic stressed that the government will continue to 
implement the stabilization program and to reform the Croatian 
economy. A significant production increase has been registered 
for the first time since 1987. The government will insist on 
financial discipline in payment transactions. Croatia has met 
all IMF conditions by implementing its economic program and is 
expected to sign a letter of intent with the IMF and conclude 
financial agreements with leading international financial 
institutions in the next few months. 
  The Council commended the government, Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic, and Pero Jurkovic, governor of the National Bank of 
Croatia, for their efforts toward the introduction of the kuna 
and creating conditions for overall international financial 
support and development and for Croatia's economic renewal. The 
Council also discussed some foreign policy issues and Croatia's 
international position. The Council was informed about the 
construction of the Altar of the Homeland, a monument erected on 
Mount Medvednica overlooking Zagreb in memory of heroes who fell 
for Croatia's freedom, the Croatian president's office has 
announced.

today, stated that the first phase of the goverment's 
stabilization program has achieved its most important goal, that 
being the reduction of the inflation rate to zero. 
Nevertheless, reports unconfirmed by the ministry state that 
the prices of agricultural products have risen around 20 
percent. Minister Jasic announced that negotiations with the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank could result in 
loans of $128 million for reconstruction, although IMF and World 
Bank sources say the talks are continuing.

in western Slavonia -- expound on their views both on the signed 
peace agreement and the economic potential and difficulties. 
They complied. The prime minister promised concrete progress 
regarding the revival of the economy, the cooperation of 
merchant banks, and the necessary input needed to ensure that 
this progress is as grand and as swift as possible. As far as 
the peace agreement is concerned, he informed those present that 
the security situation here in western Slavonia will be one of 
the points on the agenda at the session of the republic of 
Serbian Krajina's government, which is set for Tuesday, 7 June, 
in Knin. After ending this meeting in Okucani, the prime 
minister, accompanied by his ministers, went on to visit Pakrac, 
where he talked to businessmen and the inhabitants of this

  [Text] Zagreb, June 3 (AFP) -- The Croatian Government 
appealed Friday to the United Nations to take "effective" 
measures to end the "policy of genocide" being carried out 
against civilians in Bosnia-Herzegovina by Serb authorities. In 
a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Croatian 
Foreign Minister Mate Granic expressed his government's "deep 
anxiety and indignation" over what he called the Serbs' 
"systematic policy of ethnic cleansing" against the Croats and 
Moslems. Granic said the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) had 
"not taken adequate measures" to stop the abuse which had led to 
a "tragic exodus" of non-Serbs from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In all, Croatia is sheltering some 300,000 refugees from the 
conflict, with up to 250,000 others having additionally fled 
Serb-held Croatian regions. 
  A UN commission has concluded in an official report that the 
ethnic cleansing programme against the Moslems was a 
premeditated scheme. While all parties were responsible for 
acts of sexual abuse, most of the victims were Moslems, and most 
of the perpetrators were Bosnian Serbs, according to the report. 
In Zagreb, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees had expressed 
concern Thursday about the Serb pursuit of ethnic cleansing, 
which meant victims had no other choice than to flee. 
  Bosnian Premier Haris Silajdzic meanwhile said in Paris he 
was concerned at the continuing lack of a peace accord with the 
Serbs, who, he said, would not hesitate to extend the conflict. 
After meeting French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, Silajdzic 
pointed out his government had said at talks last week in France 
it was ready to compromise on territorial issues. 
  At the talks in Talloires, in the French Alps, an 
international contact group proposed to award 51 percent of 
Bosnian territory to the new Moslem-Croat federation, which is 
demanding 58 percent, and 49 to the Serbs, who control 70 
percent. But federation sources said the Moslems and Croats 
were prepared to negotiate. 
  Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic meanwhile arrived in 
Geneva 
reiterating he would not take part in ceasefire negotiations as 
long as the Serbs did not give an assurance they would evacuate 
their troops from around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Ganic 
said he would attend political discussions with the 
international contact group on Saturday but would only go to 
military talks if UN envoy Yasushi Akashi could verify the Serbs 
had left the area. But the United Nations warned in Geneva 
Friday it would cancel the peace talks if Bosnian Serb forces 
did not fully withdraw from around Gorazde by Saturday morning. 
  Talks on a truce should have begun in Geneva Thursday, but 
Bosnian Moslems refused to attend so long as Bosnian Serbs 
continued to occupy the UN-declared exclusion zone around 
Gorazde from which they had promised to pull out. 
  "As of 18:00 tonight there still remained about 20 to 25 
armed Serbs, mainly civilians it seems" inside the 
three-kilometer (two- mile) exclusion zone," said Michael 
Williams, spokesman for UN envoy Yasushi Akashi.

  [Text] The Political Department of the Croatian Army's 
Split operational zone issued a statement today in connection 
with yesterday's explosion in the military munitions depot at 
Kukuzovac, near Sinj, in which two Croatian Army soldiers were 
killed and one was wounded. The statement says that, following 
an investigation, a commission established that mines and 
explosive devices were stored in the depot in line with the 
regulations on keeping and storing such devices, so that the 
explosion did not spread. The statement also stresses that the 
explosion occurred outside the warehouse, and was caused when an 
explosive device of an unidentified type fell on the ground, 
most probably during transport. The device damaged about 20 
other mines. The Army's investigating judge is continuing the 
inquiry into the incident.

  [Excerpts] A ceremony has been held in the Croatian 
National Theater in Split to mark the third anniversary of the 
formation of the 114th Brigade of the Croatian army, the first 
reserve brigade. The ceremony was attended by families of dead 
Croatian defenders, invalids of the patriotic war, high military 
and civilian officials, and by Corps General Janko Bobetko, 
chief of staff of the Croatian Army. Sandra Stanic reports: 
  [Stanic] [passage omitted] Speaking about the beginnings of 
the brigade, Corps General Janko Bobetko stressed that many 
pages of Croatian history will be written by soldiers and 
officers of the 114th Brigade. There are many tasks ahead of 
us, the corps general added, and one of the fateful ones is to 
preserve what we have achieved, to return to Croatia every inch 
of the occupied land and to organize ourselves to be a model 
democratic and happy country. 
  [Begin Bobetko recording] We must thoroughly prepare our 
army 
and the Croatian people for the final task. If it is our fate 
to do that -- and we will do it with pleasure and 
conscientiously -- there will be no skirmishes, we will go to 
the end, to the last inch with all our force and all means 
available. We have let them know this very clearly. We must 
say and everyone must know that the Croatian state and the 
Croatian Army have the potential to do that. When and how they 
will use that potential, that is a question of decisions and 
estimates. Our task is to be prepared for it and to be up to 
the task. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Knin, 3 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel Lazo Babic, 
commander of the Western Slavonia Corps of the Serb Krajina 
Army, sent a protest letter to General Sharmi, the UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] commander for Sector West, over an incident 
that happened at a meeting of Sector West's commissions in Lipik 
yesterday. According to a statement by the Serb Krajina Army's 
Main Headquarters, Croatian General Dzanko threatened to arrest 
one of the official Krajina representatives at the talks, and a 
more serious incident was prevented only through UNPROFOR 
General Vergar's intervention. Voicing serious concern over the 
success of the upcoming talks and the safety of the Krajina 
negotiators, Col. Babic demands the Croatian general's apology 
over the incident that could have unforeseeable consequences. 
He also demands an increased level of security by UNPROFOR at 
future talks' venues.

<F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Radulovic: Is There a Rome-Knin Axis?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] The establishment of an open alliance between 
the Krajina Serbs and the new Italian political team headed by 
Silvio Berlusconi -- as Swiss paper JOURNAL DE GENEVE 
prognosticates, albeit without invoking any (un)official sources 
-- has reintroduced the story about Krajina-Italian connections 
and attempts so far at exerting diplomatic pressure on Croatia. 
[passage omitted] 
  The Swiss paper's forecast attracts attention since the 
current revival of Krajina-Italian relations ensued after a lull 
that was preceded by a case of open lobbying on the part of 
Italian senator Arduino Agnelli, favoring general Serbian 
interests on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  At the end of last September, Senator Agnelli attended a 
session of the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] 
and the Assembly proclaimed him an "honorary citizen of the 
RSK." At that time, the Krajina authorities suggested to 
Agnelli that he support Knin's initiative for Italians to 
mediate in solving disputes between Krajina and Croatia, and he 
promised to provide "good services." 
  "I hope that we will march into a liberated Zadar together. 
The Croats do not deserve to have such a lovely town," Martic 
thanked Agnelli. [passage omitted] 
  The announcements of a rapprochement between Italy and 
Krajina, if only in individual statements by more influential 
politicians, were followed by the phenomenon whereby the Italian 
question in Istria and Dalmatia became more topical. The Osimo 
agreement issue reemerged despite statements by some Italian 
parties and officials that these documents had become part of 
history for good. 
  The question is, of course, whether the Italians care so 
much 
about the status of Serbs in Krajina so that they would call 
into question their relations with their most important seacoast 
neighbor or whether they have also realized that Krajina is a 
favorable "political medium" through which one can articulate 
certain political interests more efficiently. 
  This dilemma becomes completely superfluous if one keeps in 
mind Italy's latest actions, which are aimed at hampering 
Croatian (and Slovene) admission to the European Union and 
include the Krajina card as part of the game. 
  By losing aggressive German support and with its general 
rating in the world falling, Croatia, analysts of international 
relations assess, has not only become "softer" regarding the 
possibility of Italy realizing a dominant position in the region 
of the Adriatic, but also a gratifying "issue" that Italy can 
use in order to more efficiently enter international games of 
solving the crisis on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. 
  As far as Krajina is concerned, its interest is mainly 
exhausted at a diplomatic-psychological level and therefore the 
attempt at creating a political Knin-Rome axis, although it is a 
good diplomatic move, cannot have long-term effects. Over the 
long-term, Krajina's position still depends on the 
Zagreb-Belgrade axis.

<F P=106> [Article by Nenad Ivankovic: "What Do the Americans Really </F>
Want in Bosnia?"] 
  [Text] Bonn (from VJESNIK's permanent correspondent) -- 
Does the United States see the Muslim-Croat federation as a tool 
to further its strategic-political interests in the Balkans, or 
is creation of the joint Muslim-Croat state only an attempt on 
the part of the mightiest world power to extricate itself from 
its moral and other obligations in the former Yugoslavia and to 
do so as painlessly as possible? At the same time casting the 
entire burden of the risks and uncertainty on the victims of 
Serbian aggression? 
  This dilemma is similar to the question: "Has the 
development 
of the events in Bosnia reached a phase that might be referred 
to as a new-Yalta delimitation in this part of Europe between 
Moscow and Washington, or is that only a forced construct that 
answers more to wishes than to geopolitical reality?" The 
questions and dilemmas suggest themselves spontaneously, 
especially since last week's negotiations in Vienna and the 
ministerial meeting of the United States, Russia, and the 
European Union in Geneva. In just a few days the United States 
has changed its own position, and has done so essentially to the 
detriment of the Muslim-Croat federation. Whereas in Vienna Mr. 
Redman, Clinton's special emissary for the former Yugoslavia, 
supported on behalf of the United States the demand for the 
future Bosnian federation to embrace 58 percent of the total 
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, U.S. Secretary of State 
Christopher suddenly reverted in Geneva to the European 
position, accepting division in a ratio of 51:49 to the 
advantage of the Muslims and Croats. 
  The Muslim-Croat federation was thus reduced by 7 percent in 
just a few days, and that makes the psychological-political 
damage from that U.S. loop-the-loop just that much worse. 
  Are the Americans backing the Muslim-Croat federation in any 
serious way, and are the promises and guarantees they have made 
to be believed? 
  1. There are reasons to believe that the U.S. commitment in 
Bosnia and in the Balkans as a whole is being overstated by a 
good bit. It is true that the Americans have made a stronger 
commitment (since the NATO ultimatum in Sarajevo), but basically 
the character of their commitment has not changed. It still does 
not occur to Washington to send ground forces to Bosnia nor to 
intervene seriously from the air in the events of the war there. 
There are several explanations for that, but two seem to be 
crucial: Since the disintegration of the socialist bloc and the 
bipolar division of the world, tendencies towards isolationism, 
one of the major constants and dilemmas of U.S. politics, has 
become stronger in the United States. At the same time, because 
the ideological and worldview confrontation with Moscow had come 
to an end and because of Russia's obvious economic dependence on 
the West, the Russian danger in Europe was reduced to a great 
extent. In that sense Europe had begun to lose a bit of its 
priority status for the United States. It would not be long 
before the Clinton administration would turn its foreign policy 
options and interests more towards Asia than the Old Continent. 
  What is more, aside from the moral and political obligations 
that arise from America's many years of support to the former 
Yugoslavia, Washington does not see its strategic and 
national-security interests in this part of Europe, at least not 
to the extent that perhaps was expected. 
  In one phase of his vacillating and frequently unclear 
Balkan 
policy, it is true, Clinton did attempt to explain strategic 
U.S. interests in terms of the need to protect human rights and 
freedoms, but that proved to be too weak a support for any 
serious commitment of the United States in this part of the 
world, especially since political conditions and relations in 
today's world are more and more like those in the 19th century. 
In his most recent book, which many say is his best, Kissinger 
in fact predicts that in coming years and decades there will be 
five or six great powers on the scene (instead of two blocs and 
ideologies head to head), among which a balance of power will 
have to be maintained in order to preserve global peace, and 
that means that policy based on interests, rather than a policy 
based on principles, will have to leap into the foreground. 
  Part of that vision proves to have been realized already in 
Bosnia: The principles and moral-political standards from the 
heroic period of the Cold War have been completely pushed away 
into the middle distance or background, and all that is left is 
harmonizing the interests of the key powers: the United States, 
Russia, Great Britain, France, and -- in an altogether reduced 
sense -- Germany. 
  2. Aside from the fact that U.S. national interests were not 
directly touched or threatened in the former Yugoslavia, 
limitations of Washington's involvement were also imposed by 
other circumstances, the relationship with European allies first 
of all. It has been no secret, neither yesterday nor today, that 
Great Britain and France have been supporting the project of 
creating a Great Serbia in one way or the other. Even back 
during the war in Croatia, that tendency was evident, but it 
took on its full physiognomy after the diplomatic recognition of 
Croatia and Slovenia. 
  Since Germany deserves most of the credit for diplomatic 
recognition, Paris and London tried in every way to conduct a 
policy which in the end-game would repair the damage done to the 
interests of those states by the disintegration of Yugoslavia. 
This is the line pursued not only by the subtle anti-Croat 
strategy, as a kind of substitute for a more open anti-German 
policy, but everything has been done to block any serious action 
that might halt the Serbian war of conquest. With his visit to 
Sarajevo and Bosnia, Mitterrand deliberately cheated the 
humanitarian commitment, which has blocked every other action, 
with the result in the end-game that the Serbs today hold under 
their control about 72 percent of the territory of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. 
  Those same factors have also frustrated every attempt to 
settle problems in the occupied areas of Croatia, without 
allowing Croatia even the possibility of solving that problem 
with its own forces. To be sure, the situation in France is 
today somewhat different than a few months ago. The 
intelligentsia are no longer neutral or pro-Serb, but have 
become fairly critical of Belgrade and Pale, which to some 
extent has diminished Mitterrand's own opportunity for open 
support to Serbia. But in essence France has not essentially 
altered its policy in this regard; it has only become more 
quiet. Finally, the most recent threats that Paris will withdraw 
its Blue Helmets from the occupied areas of Croatia, and perhaps 
also from Bosnia, are not aimed against the Serbs, but above all 
against Washington. Paris is dissatisfied with the fact that the 
United States did not put as much pressure on the Muslims as was 
necessary for them to accept the division of Bosnia, which 
basically guarantees Serbia recognition of the results of its 
war of conquest. 
  In Britain the situation is more unfavorable in the sense 
that the orientation of the intellectual elite (educated at 
Oxford and Cambridge) is still profoundly pro-Serb, 
pro-Karadjordjevic, so that one can hardly expect any movements 
towards a new policy there. The statements by former Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher are only the exception to the rule 
(incidentally, she does not come from the milieu of the 
Cambridge-Oxford intelligentsia). 
  So, if the Americans were to embark on an extremely severe 
course toward the Serbs in Bosnia and indeed in the former 
Yugoslavia in general, that would necessarily bring them into 
conflict with their European allies, with France and Britain 
first of all. That would also jeopardize the minimum consensus 
achieved in NATO already with the military threats to the Serbs, 
which would not have been possible without the active support of 
Paris. In a word: It is not possible at all to expect that the 
Americans would risk their relations with their European allies 
because of Bosnia, nor Croatia either, especially since this is 
nevertheless a European problem and a European conflict. 
  3. Third, relations with Russia are an equally crucial 
limiting factor. Even though the Clinton administration no 
longer looks so naively on Moscow as was the case before 
Clinton's visit to Russia early in the year, it nevertheless is 
interested in as much partnership as is possible, that is, in 
only as much confrontation as is inevitable. First, because it 
always could be worse with Russia and because Yeltsin has no 
alternative for the present. Anything else would make Russia 
still less predictable, and, given the huge nuclear potential 
which that country possesses, this could give rise to a global 
danger. In a dual sense: directly in the form of Russian 
military and political imperialism, and second, through the 
uncontrolled spread of nuclear weapons and technology even into 
the so-called "terrorist zones of the world." 
  Since Russia has up to now been standing behind Serbia, and 
no one doubts that it will continue to do so, and since indeed 
it itself has its own strategic interests in the Balkans, it is 
clear that any radical course toward the Serbs would lead the 
United States into confrontation with Russia. A confrontation 
which in theory the United States ought not to fear, but which 
Washington does not find sufficient national motives for and 
which Clinton is simply neither psychologically nor politically 
prepared for nor capable of. 
  4. All those limitations certainly do not mean that the 
United States does not have interests on the soil of the former 
Yugoslavia and will not attempt to pursue them. But certainly 
not in the fashion that the victims of Serbian aggression have 
at times imagined. 
  Washington objectively awakened from its Bosnian lethargy 
the 
moment when the Russians, following the Sarajevo ultimatum, 
"marched into Bosnia" uninvited. In the White House, which 
unfortunately is more preoccupied with U.S. health reform and 
Clinton's real or fabricated romances and financial dealings, 
they suddenly became aware of the fact that the Russians were 
right there and right then! From that moment on the United 
States has been attempting to halt that Serbian-Russian westward 
spread through some kind of a new Yalta, and doing so with 
methods and means that follow from the limitations and 
self-limitations of U.S. policy in the Balkans we have 
described. That is the moment when the idea was born of creating 
the Muslim-Croat federation and later the confederation with 
Croatia (which only then was becoming realistically possible!). 
  The goal in this, as can be seen, was for that Bosnian 
federation, Croatia, then Macedonia, certainly Albania and 
Greece, to fall into the western and U.S. sphere of interest, 
although the last of these is pro-Serb, but, most essential for 
the United States, it is a member of NATO. Although those states 
do not make up a compact geographic zone, they nevertheless 
guarantee U.S. control of the Mediterranean and indeed the 
Adriatic, since the Croatian coast has become intact. This 
actually frustrates the Russian outlet to the sea to a more 
serious extent, since Kotor Bay is no serious point of support 
in this respect, especially since everything else is under 
someone else's control. 
  5. At the same time this explains why the Americans were so 
yielding in Geneva concerning those 7 percent to the detriment 
of the Muslim-Croat federation. The problem of the Americans is 
not so much what is going to happen to a few thousand square 
kilometers as how to get the Muslims to accept a peace plan 
based on recognizing the results of the Serbian conquest without 
exerting great pressure on them. 
  For them the essential thing is for the Muslim-Croat 
federation to be large enough to survive and therefore perform 
the role which Washington has assigned it. In addition, at that 
lowest level of protection of Muslim-Croat interests in Bosnia 
it is also possible to achieve, without major confrontation, 
that accommodation with the Russians we have spoken of, as well 
as agreement with Paris and London, and, finally, with Belgrade 
and Pale. 
  Finally, the Americans have openly told Sarajevo that they 
do 
not intend to wage war on its behalf and that the solution must 
be found at the negotiating table. To be sure, there are signs 
that Washington would gladly remove the embargo on arms 
deliveries to the Muslims, as well as to the Croats, which in 
future would probably turn the situation to the advantage of the 
present victims of the Serbian aggression. But is difficult to 
believe that that will happen, since Paris and London are 
strictly against removing the embargo, and Moscow has already 
threatened countermeasures, which could particularly hurt the 
Americans in a region as sensitive for them as, say, the Persian 
Gulf. 
  6. Accordingly, we should not anticipate any greater U.S. 
commitment when it comes to helping Croatia integrate those 
occupied areas into its body as a political state. Today more or 
less all serious observers and analysts are cautioning that they 
see no way of forcing the Serbs to give up occupation and 
secession. Especially since it is in the interest of France and 
Britain for Croatia to remain "occupied" in this way. It is 
generally held that there are two realistic solutions. The first 
is for the occupied areas to remain a part of the Croatian state 
only formally, while in actuality and in future they remain 
under full Serb authority, that is, under Belgrade, with the 
possibility of subsequent annexation to a Great Serbia. That is 
why some of the observers hold that it is perhaps better for 
Croatia not to make any concessions to the Serbs in the 
direction of territorial-political autonomy, in hopes that in 
that way they might come into possession of their occupied 
areas. According to that version, it is better to keep things 
open and wait perhaps for other times. That of course carries a 
certain risk, especially with respect to possible pressures from 
outside and Serb military provocations. 
  The other solution, which observers inclined toward Croatia 
are afraid of, might be that in the end-game, as part of a peace 
solution for Bosnia and Croatia, Croatia would be compelled to 
give up its occupied territories, along with the minimal 
possibility of a correction to its advantage, which would be in 
the area of Osijek, western Slavonia, and the Zadar hinterland. 
The Americans would certainly be in favor of that correction, 
and it would guarantee integrity of the transportation system. 
  7. Kinkel's rather surprising demand, for the present the 
only one of its kind, that is, that Croatia be accorded reentry 
into the financial and business arrangements of the European 
Union because of its demonstrated cooperativeness, was mainly 
interpreted along those lines in Bonn. Minister Kinkel himself, 
who really is sincerely interested in Croatia recovering its 
occupied areas, seems to be realizing more and more that he 
cannot gain allies for something like that on the international 
scene. And Germany is unable to go it alone against all the rest. 
  It is for that reason, it is being said, that he wants to 
"bring" the European Union to compensate Croatia for the 
occupation with financial, i.e., economic, aid. Probably also 
with the muffled hope that solid financial injections into 
Croatia might perhaps have a sobering effect in the occupied 
areas. It is believed that Germany might succeed in that, and 
there are two reasons why. Most of the funds which the European 
Union would possibly donate to Croatia would be German anyway, 
since Bonn is paying the most into the Brussels treasury. 
Second, France and Britain would consent to this, since Croatia, 
and this is the most important thing to them, would still remain 
"occupied." 
  8. Of course, just as events are unfolding in the field, so 
political ideas and intentions are also subject to process. The 
situation for the present seems to be as we have described it. 
But that does not mean that this will necessarily still be the 
case in six months or even later. Especially since the Croatian 
position in the world has been strengthened and stabilized since 
the Washington agreement, above all in the sense that the Serbs, 
who bear the main responsibility for the war and the aggression, 
have themselves remained out in the international cold. To be 
sure, they still have fairly persistent and strong protectors, 
but, as we have said, things are never completely glued together.

<F P=106> [Article by Aleksa Crnjakovic: "Instead of Mesic -- </F>
Mihanovic?"] 
  [Text] It went exactly the way we forecast it: Dr. Franjo 
Greguric, Croatian parliament deputy and INA managing director, 
managed to convince all those whom it concerned that he would 
not be the right man in the right place, that is, the man to sit 
at the president's desk in the parliament's House of 
Representatives as a replacement for Stipe Mesic, who is now its 
president, but who is to leave that post since he has switched 
parties and cannot represent the parliament majority. Some other 
honorable deputies also had their names in the pot along with 
Greguric's, but, from what we have learned, the list has now 
been shortened to one man -- Nedeljko Mihanovic, member of the 
Academy. 
  Although Stipe Mesic has let it be known that he will not 
leave the post of president of his own volition, since he feels 
that as a member of another party he can defend the interests of 
the state, some parliamentary analysts nevertheless forecast 
that there will be a gentlemen's agreement. The fact is that the 
majority party has the right to choose the president of the 
parliament everywhere in the world. 
  As matters now stand, Mesic will withdraw, but he will not 
drop out of the race. It is assumed, that is, that his new party 
will nominate none other than himself as its candidate to oppose 
the probable candidate of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] -- 
Mihanovic. There are also those who think that the strongest 
opposition party, the HSLS [Croatian Social-Liberal Party], will 
offer its candidate as well, so that there would be three in the 
race. The winner would be whoever got 70 votes, or, if two are 
left, the one who gets one vote more than his rival. 
<H5>  Balloting -- Open or Secret? </H5>
  The fight for votes would be interesting. But the collection 
of signatures to qualify to run in the race would be equally 
interesting. The candidates must collect at least 30 signatures. 
In addition to his own 17, the Liberal candidate might perhaps 
also get two IDS [Istrian Democratic Conference] signatures, 
perhaps even a dissident or two from the HSS [Croatian Peasant 
Party], and an independent like Vladimir Bebic. In addition to 
his own 11, Mesic would also get six signatures of the SDP 
[Social Democratic Party], perhaps even a few votes from the HSP 
[Croatian Rights Party], and a few HND [Croatian Independent 
Democrats] members "if needed." 
  If there are several candidates in the running, the 
balloting 
may be secret. Nevertheless, if nine deputies seek an open 
ballot, the decision could be made to that effect. In that case, 
the opposition might demonstratively withdraw from the chamber, 
blackmailing the incumbent party and forcing it to accept a 
secret ballot. They are not after all electing the president of 
a soccer club, for God's sake, but the president of the 
parliament! 
  And in that case everything becomes uncertain for the simple 
reason that now the likely HDZ candidate does not enjoy enough 
confidence and prestige among the oppositionists for the outcome 
to be certain. If Mesic had been opposed by Dr. Greguric, there 
would not have been that uncertainty. 
  Dr. Nedeljko Mihanovic is not a politician; as he himself 
acknowledges, he simply wandered into politics because of his 
strong desire to help in bringing down the Yugoslav state, which 
he had always been against, and to help build Croatia, which had 
always been his dream. He entered the elections out of 
enthusiasm, simply in order to help the HDZ, in which he 
enrolled at the very beginning, in whose program he placed 
absolute trust, and whose leader he has followed. So, since he 
never had political aspirations, nor was he ambitious, and since 
he was pushed into political waters, Dr. Mihanovic, as they say, 
is not comfortable there. 
  Which is no wonder when you realize that he has spent his 
entire working life in the tranquil, shaded and apolitical 
chambers of the Institute for Literature and Theater of the HAZU 
[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts], as a consulting 
scholar. If he is nevertheless elected president of the 
parliament, he will not have an easy time of it. Academician 
Mihanovic is not young, and even by temperament he has always 
been known as a tranquil man attached to books, not a potential 
agile politician. 
<H5>  Life Among Books </H5>
  He was born on 16 February 1930 in Sitno Donje, near Split, 
to father Marin Mihanovic, a farmer, and mother Marija. His wife 
is a lawyer, they have a daughter. He has a Ph.D. in philology. 
In 1958 he went to the Institute for Literature, where he became 
director of the section for literature. "If I searched the world 
over for a better position than this one, I never would have 
found it. From this warm pillow of aesthetics and art, I put my 
head on the very volatile political pillow," he was to sadly 
acknowledge. He has been a reader of Croatian language at 
Hamburg University. 
  He has published a number of essays, criticism, and 
lexigraphical contributions, he has edited critical editions of 
the works of Croatian writers, for example, the poetry of Stanko 
Vraz, the poetic works of Vladimir Nazor, Govor Umjetnosti 
(The Language of Art), Oblikotvornost i smisao 
(Form and Meaning), Mjera i vrednost (Measure 
and Value). 
  He won on the slate of the HDZ in Medvescak Opcina in Zagreb 
and became a deputy in what then was the Chamber of Opstinas. He 
is today a deputy in the House of Representatives. "I tried to 
withdraw from politics right at the outset, but they said that 
the interests of the Croatian state and the Croatian people were 
at stake, and I am simply disarmed by that argument. I have an 
aversion to politics, to officialdom, but I would never stand in 
the way," says this literary historian, who is only afterwards a 
deputy. Will this man of the pen get his bearings behind the 
president's desk? 
  When you talk to Academician Mihanovic, you are aware of 
having a poetic soul opposite you. If he becomes president of 
the House of Representatives, how will he deal with the 
political wolves and foxes? Will he be able to react quickly, 
using every possible means? Or perhaps, that moderateness will 
have a good effect on the hot passions in the parliament?

<F P=106> [Text of interview with new Assembly President Dr. Nedeljko </F>
Mihanovic by Aleksa Crnjakovic; place and date not given: "I Do 
Not Crave Honor and Power"] 
  [Text] When you meet Academician Nedeljko Mihanovic 
in the corridor of the Croatian parliament, you always have the 
feeling that he is apologizing for being there. Although he 
gives an impression of self-denial and modesty, Deputy Mihanovic 
has always overcome a certain uneasiness just in advance of 
public speeches in the chamber. As a rule these are not speeches 
for the general public. They are full of associations, of 
historical reminiscences, of metaphors, quotations, a teacher's 
admonitions, and a poet's conceits. We stopped him in a 
"hit-and-run attack" to check out the stories circulating in the 
corridors of parliament that he will in fact become the 
president of the House of Representatives, to the surprise of 
many. 
  [Crnjakovic] If you are offered the post of president of the 
parliament, will you accept it? 
  [Mihanovic] I am not giving any thought to that at all. I 
have seen my name in the papers. I am not a man who craves pomp 
and power; I want to remain neutral. But if that would help to 
calm down the entire situation, to prevent a crisis from 
occurring, I would accept. I look on that position with awe, 
with great responsibility and to some extent with an inner fear 
in the face of that challenge. If there is a need for my person 
to fill a vacuum, I will always accept that burden for Croatia. 
<H5>  Trust in Common Sense </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Is there good reason to fear a possible 
parliamentary crisis? 
  [Mihanovic] I am convinced that there is not. I always 
believe in a certain awareness of people who could cause some 
possible trouble in the parliament. I believe that even Mesic 
will not accept that, and he is saying that they are sticking to 
the line of Croatian statehood, that they will not do anything 
which could harm the Croatian state. Changing leaders is a 
democratic proceeding. If they have left the party, they cannot 
obstruct the parliament. I believe that common sense will 
prevail with them. What must be done will be done according to 
democratic procedure. 
  [Crnjakovic] What needs to be done? 
  [Mihanovic] To resolve the issue of the presidents of the 
House of Representatives and the Chamber of Zupanijas, since by 
the rules of the game the leading party has the right to those 
posts. 
  [Crnjakovic] What if they do nevertheless remain in the way? 
  [Mihanovic] That would be very harmful for Croatia, since 
the 
parliament would not be able to enact laws, elections would have 
to be called, which means paralysis for at least six to eight 
months. Croatia would be marking time, it would be stymied, and 
I believe that is not in anyone's interest. Less money, lower 
output, a lower standard of living.... 
  [Crnjakovic] Perhaps someone intends just that? 
  [Mihanovic] That would then be sabotage, destroying the 
foundations of the young state, which is doing everything to get 
in the flow of Europe and the world, to resolve the issue of its 
occupied areas, which wants economic progress. Anyone who has 
such intentions would be working against his own Croatian 
people. I think that such an outlook will not prevail. I believe 
in the unity of Croatian consciousness when it comes to the 
interest of the Croatian state. I cannot understand anyone 
sitting in the Croatian parliament being against the interest of 
the Croatian people. 
<H5>  Some People in the HDZ Have Sighed With Relief </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] How do you evaluate the events related to 
establishment of the new party by people from your own ranks? 
  [Mihanovic] I do not think it was on constitutional grounds. 
Individuals felt that they had not been satisfied in their 
claims and vanities. They thought that they did not have enough 
power. Some perhaps thought that it was they who should be 
conducting the policy of the Croatian state from the positions 
they held. Why, then, did we elect a head of state?! With the 
help of the other instruments of power, he is conducting the 
policy of the state. A parallel policy cannot be conducted. Do 
you happen to know who is the president of the parliament in 
Germany? That post is important, but the president of the 
parliament does not shape the policy of the state. Some people 
have perhaps overstated the powers which they felt they should 
have in the positions they held, and then they took action, 
mistakenly judging that they could cause a breakdown. They 
thought it was enough for one strong man to leave the HDZ and 
the party would fall apart. 
  [Crnjakovic] What is the situation in the HDZ? 
  [Mihanovic] Very stable. There are no internal convulsions. 
Some even sighed with relief that we no longer have the 
tug-of-war between ultra-left and ultra-right, but are following 
a middle and moderate line in creating the state of the Croatian 
people. This is the only realistic program which will not take 
us into the extreme blocs. 
  [Crnjakovic] What will happen if President Mesic does not 
want to withdraw voluntarily? 
  [Mihanovic] The democratic procedure called for by the rules 
will be invoked, no one will be "removed" illegally. I think 
there will be no skirmish, since this will be done according to 
procedure. I think that these people will not cause any 
interference. The parliament will continue its work. 
<H5>  Statements Harmful to Croatia </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] Would it be less harmful to leave Mesic in 
place 
even though he belongs to another party? 
  [Mihanovic] You never know what kind of propaganda he might 
deliver from that post as a member of another party, an 
opposition party. You know that numerous foreign and domestic 
delegations visit him. A case might arise when he made 
propaganda harmful to Croatian state policy and harmful to the 
legally elected government, but to the benefit of his own party. 
The party which has the majority would not allow that in any 
country. Let us be clear, I do not preclude the possibility of 
his behaving correctly, but there are the rules of the game. In 
addition, his statements of alleged concentration camps and 
supposedly deliberate murders are harmful to Croatia. I am not 
saying that this has not occurred, but war brings with it 
horrible things which you cannot always control. In war 
prisoners are taken, they have to be put somewhere, but when you 
say "concentration camp," you automatically think of gas 
chambers, torture and other horrors. We did not have 
concentration camps. We did not kill people deliberately, we did 
not throw them into any Jazovkas. 
  [Crnjakovic] Will the balloting for president of the 
parliament be open or secret? 
  [Mihanovic] Why should it be secret? That is not necessary. 
If anyone is against, why should he be afraid of declaring it 
publicly? No one is going to discredit anyone in that way. I 
hope that we will preserve the democratic and tolerant spirit in 
the parliament. 
  [Crnjakovic] Does that exist now? 
  [Mihanovic] Yes. We can be satisfied with that. In this time 
of war, when passions are additionally intensified, we are 
behaving well. It is normal for there to be intolerant 
individuals in all parties, but the parliament as a whole is 
behaving in a civilized way. Perhaps at some points it might be 
more constructive and not try to obstruct the government. Mr. 
Valentic is committing his entire potential, intellectual and 
otherwise, to improving Croatia as much as possible, and so are 
his ministers. I was profoundly offended when Vladimir Bebic 
said of Dr. Granic, deputy prime minister, that he was a war 
criminal. That is horrible! And to say that of a man who by his 
title and his spiritual makeup is a humanist! This was said from 
the speaker's desk completely out of the blue and without 
evidence! For me that was the most serious incident in the 
parliament in these past four years. 
<H5>  I Have Known Tudjman for a Long Time </H5>
  [Crnjakovic] You are often defending the president of the 
state. Are you defending him personally, or the dignity of the 
office he holds? 
  [Mihanovic] It is not a question of any personality cult. I 
have known the president of the republic for a long time, since 
back in the 1960's when he worked in the Institute, when we 
worked together on certain programs. Even then I was surprised 
at the imaginativeness of the cultural policy he was pursuing. 
That was very brave. The Croatian line always followed from his 
conclusions, although it was not simple to pursue the Croatian 
option at the Institute for the History of the Working Class 
Movement. That was gratifying to all of us around him in the 
Institute for Literature, since we all had a Croatian 
orientation, we did not have a single party member among us. He 
pursued a wise and moderate policy. Since that time I have 
respected him as a sensible person, someone who always thinks 
out his reasons and all the consequences of a particular move. 
The HDZ Program was one of the clearest, that is why I committed 
myself to him. I do not believe in the collective consciousness. 
I believe that one man, if he heads a movement and a program, 
can accomplish much historically. No one will be able to dispute 
that Tudjman is the creator of the Croatian state. That is a 
fact which cannot be denied. Let us be happy that we have 
created the Croatian state. This is not an illusion, a 
phantasmagoria, it is here and now. Everyone takes it into 
account today. What its nature will be is now up to us. Italy 
has been functioning for 40 years, and you see what has happened 
there. Taking things all in all, I think that we have achieved 
the maximum.

<F P=106> [Text of interview with Silvije Degen, president of the </F>
Party of Socialists of Croatia, by Jovo Paripovic; place and 
date not given: "Tudjman Is Not Croatia, Nor Is Milosevic 
Serbia"] 
  [Text] Silvije Degen, president of the Party of 
Socialists of Croatia [SSH], is said in Zagreb to be one of the 
most charismatic figures on the Croatian political scene. He was 
a candidate for president in the recent elections in that 
republic. His involvement on all sides is more important than 
that. As a lawyer he seems not to have missed a single important 
trial in the former Yugoslavia. A fighter for human rights and 
freedom of public speech, he refers to the law-governed state as 
his basic objective, and from that follows the social welfare 
state, but not the one in which there is absolute equality of 
all people, but a legal and social equality within which every 
member of that state can achieve equal rights with equal work. 
  Silvije Degen is a descendant, as he likes to say, of a 
woman nostalgic for Austro-Hungary, and he comes from a family 
of "traditional urban leftists," so that he too is today on the 
Croatian left, but some people are inclined to say that he is a 
member of the so-called "fundamental left." Such people like it 
that his socialist ideas date from before Bolshevism and 
nationalism. That is why we began our interview with the 
question: What are the chances of the left in Croatia? 
  [Degen] The greatest need of the Croatian state as a whole, 
but likewise of every one of its citizens individually (except 
those who like things the way they are), is to finally bring 
about a more just society, true democracy, the rule of law, 
order, and security. That alone is sufficient for the conclusion 
that the left has great opportunities. 
  According to our assessment, a strong and clearly defined 
leftist party would today have no particular problem getting 30 
percent of the electorate. In its actions the present Croatian 
Government is doing everything to increase that percentage. Not 
only has it cast on the backs of the people who live from their 
wages and pensions, that is, from their labor, the entire burden 
of financing the war, but it has also made it possible for a 
small group of people from within the country and abroad to 
become rich at their expense. 
<H5>  The Disunited Left </H5>
  [Paripovic] Do you mean that life is difficult in Croatia? 
That the state is the one that in a sense is plundering its 
citizens? 
  [Degen] A foreign journalist recently asked me how people 
can 
survive at all with that kind of income. I replied that in 
Croatia people are not living, but merely surviving. He then 
asked me whether people are selling the "family silver" to buy 
food. I replied that the state has taken away from its citizens 
the "family jewels," that is, the economy, which was built over 
decades and is now being sold off for a song to the new rich, 
and then they call it privatization. That cannot be justified in 
terms of the war, nor the displaced persons, nor the threat to 
the Croatian state of the Serbian rebellion. Quite the opposite. 
This will in fact be demonstrated in the very next election in 
Croatia. 
  [Paripovic] There is ferment on the left, and there have 
been 
various games. How much will all that help, and how much will it 
hurt the Croatian left in taking its place on the political 
scene, which in your assessment offers exceedingly good 
opportunities? 
  [Degen] In Croatia today the left organized in parties is 
weak and disunited. I personally think that the ferment you 
mentioned (and those who wish can even refer to it as games) has 
been extremely worthwhile. It results in clearer definition of 
the parties, with each passing day it is becoming clearer who is 
for what, and that is making it easier for people to make a 
choice. This is a normal consequence of the changes and of the 
stratifications that have occurred in society. The party in 
power has define itself as the party of primitive accumulation, 
that is, as the advocate of the stratum that is enriching itself 
without any restraint and without any concern for the victims. 
The left must also defined itself from scratch. The worst-case 
scenario would be for everything to remain as it has been up to 
now. 
  [Paripovic] Mika Tripalo is spoken of as a man who would 
stand at the head of a united left. He himself sees the problem 
of how to create that united "left-wing bloc." How do you look 
on that? 
  [Degen] That problem has been overcome. We tried to unite 
all 
the left-wing parties -- I personally worked very hard on that 
--but without success. We were thwarted along the way by certain 
personal interests (usually referred to as "interests of 
leaders"), but also objectively by differing views of the policy 
which should be conducted. That is the reason for a certain 
polarization within the SDP [Party of Democratic Reform] 
(Racan's party -- author's note) and within the SDU [Social 
Democratic Union] (Horvat's party -- author's note). As things 
stand now, there could be a rallying of a substantial portion of 
people around the SSH, which I head. That is also the choice of 
Mika Tripalo, an honorable man, I repeat, who has great 
intellectual power and an indisputable reputation, who has been 
and has remained a true leftist regardless of his difficult 
experiences in life and politics. His commitment will help many 
people in Croatia to make a choice. 
<H5>  The Traps of Nationalism </H5>
  [Paripovic] If there is a unification of the left headed by 
Tripalo, what is the fate of Racan and the SDP? 
  [Degen] The Croatian voters will answer that in the next 
election. In the first election in 1990, in spite of all the 
communist baggage, the SDP got almost 30 percent of the vote. 
Two years later, it got between 5 and 6 percent. But that did 
not impact them in such a way as to change their timid policy of 
a "self-denying opposition" -- that is Racan's expression 
--which guards the government from itself, instead of fighting 
for the interests of its voters. I think that true leftists and 
sober people, and there are many of them in the SDP, have good 
reason to fear the next election. 
  [Paripovic] Socialists who have declared themselves to be a 
"left-wing force" are in power in Serbia. How willing are you to 
talk with those left-wing forces? What in general is your view 
of a linkup of left-wing forces on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia? 
  [Degen] The Serbian "socialists" are a party of war, of 
conquest, of blood and soil, and I do not see what I would have 
in common with them. In their arrogant plundering of their own 
citizens, they are much closer to the party in power in Croatia. 
I do not know Slobodan Milosevic's wife and her party, and I 
have no desire to. I am not willing to talk to them, at least 
not on terms of a leftist with leftists. In any case we have 
good and strong relations with many socialists in the world as 
well as with the Socialist International. We also have constant 
contacts with left-wing parties from the states which were 
formerly parts of Yugoslavia, for example, with the Bosnian 
Social-Democrats. We will certainly have contacts with the 
Serbian parties when the war ends, when there is mutual 
recognition (including internationally recognized borders), when 
the displaced persons are returned to their homes, and when real 
left-wing parties appear on the scene in Serbia. 
  [Paripovic] Croatia is having a hard time ridding itself of 
certain symbols which remind the objective observer of an 
unpleasant past, and fanatics are justifying themselves in terms 
of tradition and everything else. How do you look on the return 
of the kuna, the obstinacy concerning the Square of the Victims 
of Fascism, the renaming of streets, and the building of the 
"Altar of the Homeland" on Medvednica? 
  [Degen] In phrasing the question, you fell into a trap and 
equated Croatia with the party in power, or, more accurately, 
with the radical nationalistic segment of that party and with 
President Tudjman. They are not Croatia, just as Milosevic and 
his group are not Serbia. However, they are still strong enough 
to impose their will. But even when it comes to symbols, we 
should not fall into the traps of nationalism with the opposite 
sign. Croatia should not give up the checkerboard flag because 
it was flown by the ustasha criminals in a horrible period (not 
just "unpleasant"). Nor, certainly, will Serbia give up its 
historic crest because many chetnik crimes have now been 
committed under it. There is another thing in the examples which 
you have mentioned. I will repeat what I said in the speech at 
the citizens rally in Zagreb commemorating Victory Day (9 May). 
I referred to taking away the name of the Square of Victims of 
Fascism, 8 May Street (the date of Zagreb's liberation), the 
destruction of antifascist monuments, and so forth, and I quote, 
as "a barbaric act of the primitives in power." In speaking 
against the kuna [marten], I said in figurative terms that it is 
the "smallest but bloodthirstiest mammal on the globe." What 
else did you mention? The Altar of the Homeland? Let's get 
serious. The Croatian public is horrified at that and is 
laughing at it. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  The HDZ Spirit Will Not Last </H5>
  [Paripovic] The Social Democrats are in power in Europe, 
from 
Sweden southward through the continent. Will Social Democracy 
take advantage of the opportunity, or will the forces of the 
nationalistic bloc succeed in taking the people to the other 
side once again? 
  [Degen] It will not succeed. That is clear even now in 
Croatia. Provided of course that the state of war really comes 
to an end and the feeling of the national threat really 
diminishes. But even now there is a fierce stratification taking 
place. Even on the Croatian right they are divided over the 
question of whether introducing the law-governed state can be 
postponed until internationally recognized Croatian borders are 
established. "And what will there be until then? the HDZ 
spirit?" That was the reaction of one of the leaders of the new 
party that has arisen in the bosom of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union]. Croatia of course has the well-known problems 
of freedom of the media, equality of parties on the public 
scene, the election law -- but all that will not stand in the 
way of the changes which are inevitable.

    [Editorial Report] The following items on political and 
economic developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from 
periodicals published in the republic. 
<H5>  Controversy Over New Croatian Currency </H5>
  Croatian and Serbian newspapers have published articles 
condemning the introduction of the kuna (Serbo-Croatian for 
marten) as the new Croatian currency, mainly because it had 
heretofore been used only in the Independent State of Croatia 
(NDH--World War II pro-Nazi state ruled by Ante Pavelic). 
  "The replacement of the Croatian dinar with the Croatian 
kuna 
is primarily a political act.... The name kuna itself is pure 
politics, because it defines the origin of the current Croatian 
state differently than the Constitution does. Instead of the 
current name, derived from the Yugoslav dinar and originally 
from the Roman denarius, we are getting a name which the NDH's 
money bore.... Thus, the wishes and dreams of influential 
persons nostalgic for the NDH are being fulfilled," the 9 May 
edition of the Split weekly FERAL TRIBUNE writes, going on to 
cite Josip Manolic, vice president of the newly founded Croatian 
Independent Democrats and a leading critic of Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman, as saying that Tudjman personally gave the order 
which the HDZ majority in the Croatian Assembly "simply obeyed 
in a discipled manner." 
  The 5 May issue of the Zagreb weekly GLOBUS also published 
criticism by Manolic of the decision on the new monetary unit. 
The kuna has never been the Croatian currency, Manolic said, 
except during the time of NDH. Marten pelts, he noted, were 
merely a commodity used for bartering in the time before Croatia 
had currency, just as were seashells, leather, or sheep. The use 
of marten pelts was absolutely not a tradition, he added, in 
spite of what Tudjman and others who support the return of the 
NDH currency claim. 
  Manolic went on to say that numerous "pogroms" against 
minorities, and even against many Croats, were carried out 
during the four years the NDH existed. "We should be realistic. 
Neither the Jews nor the Serbs will be able to accept the kuna 
as their money," he continued, observing that the NDH was not a 
"shining" period in Croatian history and that nothing from that 
period should be linked to the present Croatia. "We cannot 
seriously consider the reintegration of the occupied territories 
with such things as the kuna," he concluded, according to GLOBUS. 
  "The introduction of the name kuna for Croatia's currency is 
a harmful political move, one of those that are renewing 
Pavelic's Independent State of Croatia," the 5 May issue of the 
Zagreb daily VJESNIK cites Branko Horvat, president of the 
Social-Democratic Union (SDU), as stating at an SDU press 
conference. Horvat went on to say, according to VJESNIK, that 
"the kuna has never been Croatian money; it was invented during 
the NDH, and there is no reason whatsoever to reintroduce this 
name. This is obviously a concession to the ustasha elements 
that surround President Tudjman, and this name offends the pride 
of cultured Croatian people." 
  Several Croatian politicians critical of the introduction of 
the kuna have also been cited in the Belgrade press. For 
example, Silvije Degen, leader of the Socialist Party of Croatia 
and renowned Zagreb lawyer and human rights activist, noted 
during an interview in the 21-22 May Belgrade daily BORBA, that 
"symbolically, the marten is the smallest but most bloodthirsty 
mammal on the face of the earth." 
<H5>  Share of Zagreb Brewery Sold to Belgian Firm </H5>
  With the signing of an agreement for the sale of 23.78 
percent of the shares of the Zagreb Pivovara (brewery), one of 
the largest privatization deals in Croatia to date, worth 40 
million German marks [DM], has been concluded, reported the 5 
May VJESNIK. The Belgian firm Interbrew immediately paid double 
the "nominal" value of DM9.7 million for the shares, and is 
planning to invest an additional DM21 million in the Zagreb 
brewery -- DM11 million immediately and DM10 million in a year 
-- VJESNIK reported, adding that the Belgian firm for the 
present has a minority stake but that its share will increase 
with the additional capitalization. The contract was signed on 4 
May by Ivan Penic, president of the Croatian Privatization Fund, 
and Hans H. Meerloo, president of the executive board of the 
Belgian firm. The privatization fund management board 
unanimously decided to sell the Zagreb Pivovara shares to the 
Belgian firm, which made the highest bid, VJESNIK added. 
<H5>  German Firm Becomes Majority Owner of Koncar </H5>
  The German firm EGE, through "additional investment" in the 
Rade Koncar firm in Slavonska Pozega, has become majority owner 
of this "relatively small but profitable export-oriented firm," 
according to the 5 May VJESNIK. During the capitalization 
process, which has been going on for almost two years, the 
German partner has invested DM7.3 million in Koncar. Production 
of tube heaters began in 1993, and this year funds were invested 
in the production of heating plates. Koncar-EGE director Zeljko 
Bohm told VJESNIK that annual production of about 2.5 million 
heating plates and 2 million tube heaters is planned. Most of 
the production is for export to Austria, Germany, and 
Switzerland, and production for the Italian market is especially 
significant. This year, 500,000 heating plates will be delivered 
to two Italian buyers.

  [Text] A sit-in began at 0600 this morning at the Katowice 
steelworks. Twelve thousand workers have joined the strike so 
far. All production and support sections of the steelworks are 
at a standstill. The strike is supported by most of the trade 
unions operating at the steelworks. The strike committee, 
appointed by Sierpien-80 [August-80] trade union activists, is 
demanding pay increases of 2,000,000 zloty per month, a 
30-percent bonus and a one-time payment of 3,000,000 zlotys to 
every striking worker. 
  The damping down of the iron blast furnace number 1 has 
begun 
and is expected to be completed by 1500. A rally of all staff 
is planned for 1300. 
  The steelworks' management is still of the opinion that it 
is 
impossible to meet the strikers' demands, as this would quickly 
lead to bankruptcy. The management has announced that it would 
rather resign than give in to the demands.

  [Text] Before his departure for Great Britain today, 
President Lech Walesa said that he sees an opportunity for the 
reconstruction of a political camp that would attain an 
electoral success similar to that of Solidarity five years ago. 
The condition for this is, however, that Solidarity politicians 
start to listen to him. Walesa stated that he is certain of his 
victory in the presidential election next year. 
  [Correspondent Maciej Sojka] Walesa feels that low ratings 
in 
public opinion poll surveys--in which he is led by several other 
candidates for the presidential chair--do not negate his chances 
of a second term in the Belweder Palace. 
  [Walesa] "That is why I am convinced I will win as 
president." 
  [Sojka] The president does not yet know whether he will sign 
the neo-popiwek law. He admitted that he sees no reason to 
hurry with this decision. 
  [Walesa] "Well, not much is taking place. I see certain 
people who have decent earnings, of 90 million, and these 
paupers who have a million--and we are so scared of them?" 
  [Sojka] Asked whether he will stand by his invitation to 
German President Roman Herzog to the commemorations of the 50th 
anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, the president said that he 
never goes back on his word.

  [Text] At a meeting that lasted one-and-a-half hours, 
Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of finance, 
presented Michael Deppler, the chairman of the IMF delegation, 
with Poland's economic strategy. 
  Let us recall that the IMF delegation has been in Poland on 
a 
two-week visit. The aim of the mission is to work out a new 
annual agreement with the fund. Following the meeting, Deputy 
Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said: 
  [Begin recording] [Kolodko] We have complete unanimity here 
that such a strategy was missing in the past few years, and the 
fund will, I believe, accept what we propose. But we would like 
to agree on a number of subjects, first and foremost on the 
reconstruction of the financial sector, as well as further 
progress toward macroeconomic stabilization. 
  [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] Sir, as new minister of 
finance, will you want to introduce any changes in agreements 
that we occasionally sign with the IMF? 
  [Kolodko] No. At the moment, we want to work out an 
agreement; we are hoping that the IMF board will accept them at 
the end of July or in early August. It will be the agreement 
establishing certain proportions for the nearest period. We 
have our own plans, and there is a question whether the fund 
shares the same opinion. We have established that essentially 
there is a far-reaching convergence of views. Therefore, there 
is no need to introduce any changes--just to work out an 
agreement the fund will accept. We will generally follow that 
line, which has been marked out in the strategy for Poland and 
which will be the subject of parliamentary debate on Thursday. 
  [Koziol] What significance will the conclusion of this new 
agreement with the IMF have for Poland? 
  [Kolodko] First and foremost, it will put our activities in 
order. It will also be confirmation by the outside world that 
our line of the economic policy that Prime Minister Pawlak's 
government, the Democratic Left Alliance, and the Polish Peasant 
Party coalition government has been implementing is accepted by 
international financial circles. It will also be an extra 
encouragement for additional influx of investment from private 
sources, which we are keen to obtain because our strategy 
envisages that we obtain a maximum of these resources. Finally, 
it will have a concrete meaning in the sense that we will obtain 
more resources from the IMF, which will help us finance certain 
plans, especially those connected with the balancing of our 
balance of payments in the coming period. 
  [Koziol] If I remember correctly, the resources we obtained 
came to about $600 million. Will the new agreement--that is, if 
we manage to sign it--promise a similar amount? 
  [Kolodko] No, the amount will be smaller, but we are already 
in a different phase. Today, we do not borrow money left, 
right, and center. As a result of our policies and strategies, 
our economy is on a growth path, and we will borrow money abroad 
only when it is really needed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by "dz": "GUS--How Much State-Owned Property?"] </F>
  [Text] According to the Central Office of Statistics 
[GUS], at the end of last year, just 39 percent of the employed 
worked in the public sector (formerly known as the "state-owned 
sector"). The highest numbers were employed in the health 
protection and education systems, where, according to official 
statistics, the role of the private sector continues to be 
minimal. 
  The prevalence of the public sector over the private one 
also 
continues to exist in transportation and industries, even 
though, when it comes to the latter, the public sector's role 
continues to decrease. The trade and construction industries 
have clearly been mostly privatized. 
  Within the so-called material production area, (without 
taking ownership distinctions into account), 5.9 million people 
worked in the last quarter of 1993, with the highest number (3.2 
million people) in industries. Out of the 2.8 million people 
outside of the material-production sector, 1.1 million were 
employed in the education system, 815,000 in health service, 
323,000 in state administration and the justice system, and 
241,000 in finance and insurance. 
  Salaries in the nonmaterial sector were lower by as much as 
11.1 percent than salaries in the material sector--that was the 
biggest difference in three years. The biggest differences were 
reported with regard to salaries in health protection and in 
education: They were lower by 15.5 percent than salaries of 
those employed in enterprises. On the other hand, average 
salaries in the state administration exceeded those in 
enterprises by 33 percent, but that means a relative 
deterioration of the ratios: In 1992, salaries of clerks were 
higher by almost 40 percent than the average salary paid out in 
enterprises. 
  In the fourth quarter of 1993, the average salary in the 
material sector amounted to 4.7 million zlotys [Z], while the 
average salary outside of the sector was Z4.1 million, including 
Z3.6 million in education and health services, and Z5.4 million 
per month in science. 
  In industries, where the average salary was almost Z5 
million 
per month, very big differences were reported between individual 
branches: Z9 million (without annual awards) in the excavation 
industry, but only Z4.3 million per month, on average, in the 
processing industry. Out of the material sector, the lowest 
salaries were reported in agriculture--Z3.5 million--while those 
in forestry were not much higher--Z3.7 million per month. 
  The average employee retirement pension was Z2.8 million 
before taxes and 2.3 million per month after taxes. Regarding 
agricultural retirement pensions, the numbers were Z1.5 million 
and Z1.3 million per month, respectively. Employee pensions 
[renta pracownicza] were Z1.7 million and 1.3 million per month, 
respectively. Last year, we had as many as 8.730 million senior 
citizens [emeryci] and pensioners [rencisci].

  [Text] In today's edition of the "Signals of the Day" 
program on the First Program of Polish Radio, Grzegorz Kolodko, 
deputy prime minister and minister of finance, denied the claims 
of certain economists that drift is the characteristic of 
economic policy, which in their view threatens the slowdown of 
the economic reforms. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] Of course, I do not agree with so 
critical a judgment. I can cite judgments that write with 
euphoria of the economic program of this government, which I 
regard as an exaggeration in the other direction. This is not 
drift. We are sailing forward fairly efficiently. We have 
caught the wind in our sails. It is difficult to gain control 
over certain processes. Others are altogether well controlled by 
us, which does not mean that there are not problems. 
  It is difficult to describe as drift a situation in which we 
have a growth of production over the five months of this year by 
10 percent in real terms. It is difficult to describe as drift 
a situation in which we have inflation over the first five 
months of the year that is all the time high [as heard] because 
there is no doubt that certain positive processes that are 
taking place in our economy are also the achievements of 
decisions and activities that were undertaken in the past. And, 
altogether, I would propose that we consider things less in 
terms of the category of the achievements of this or that 
government because these are, above all, the achievements of 
hard-working people. And, if the government will not hinder 
them in their work and will just create good conditions for 
them, which we are very concerned about doing, then I judge we 
will have cause for satisfaction. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 6 Jun--Writing in the NOWA EUROPA daily, 
Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol has announced plans to 
create special economic zones in this country. In his view, the 
creation of the first zones will ensue toward the end of this 
year, following the appropriate legislative process. Alongside 
the so-called multifaceted zones, in which we will be 
particularly concerned to attract investors with large projects, 
we wish to have zones oriented toward certain specific areas of 
activity, the minister announced. It will not be the level of 
investment that is most significant, but the content--that is to 
say, the know-how, the technological value of the project, and 
so on. 
  According to the head of the Industry Ministry, neither a 
lower nor a higher value threshold for investment capital is 
being set. On the other hand, the quality of the investment, the 
level of employment, and the ecological character of the 
investment will have a particular significance. As he revealed, 
the Mielec area is being considered, among others, inasmuch as 
it is one of the originators of this idea and an area that 
fought for it, and, in general, those areas in which there are 
concentrated large, unexploited assets; for instance, those for 
the reconstruction of the nuclear power station in Zarnowiec. 
  According to the minister, there is considerable interest 
among foreign investors. The greatest number of offers comes 
from the United States. There are also many proposals from 
Germany, Italy, France, and the Polish capital.

  [Text] Vranov nad Toplou -- The developments leading to 
the dismissal of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet, the causes of the 
dismissal, and the current political situation in Slovakia were 
the topics discussed by Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], at a rally with 
the citizens of Vranov nad Toplou yesterday. 
  He said that the Meciar government could not concentrate 
forces on completing its program because, among other things, 
"Slovak President Michal Kovac complicated the situation by his 
speech in parliament [on 9 March] when he confused his 
jurisdiction and started enforcing a tough policy." 
  The NRSR chairman went on to say that, with one or two 
exceptions such as the law on levying a value-added tax of 26 
percent on selected types of goods, which has been prepared by 
Jozef Moravcik's government, the laws being currently adopted in 
parliament were mostly prepared by Meciar's cabinet. He 
stressed that the current parliament is no longer able to make 
unanimous progressive decisions and that conflicts and 
disagreements prevail in it.

  [Text] The Press and Information Department of the Slovak 
Government Office has published its stance on statements made by 
Vladimir Meciar, the HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] 
chairman, about the coalition government. The department's 
statement says that Meciar's repeated statements about the 
existence of secret agreements within the current government 
coalition -- according to which the Jozef Moravcik cabinet is 
alleged to have assumed the obligation to fulfill the demands 
outlined in eight points by the political entities representing 
the Hungarian national minority -- have revealed that the HZDS 
is completely under the influence of demagogic lies. 
  In its statement, the Press and Information Department of 
the 
Slovak Government Office once again stresses that there are no 
secret agreements obliging the current government to fulfill the 
above-mentioned number of demands. What does exist is the 
government program statement adopted by the National Council. 
  The statement goes on to stress that the HZDS chairman's 
criticism of the course of privatization is equally self-serving 
and demagogic, as it was his cabinet that slowed down the 
transformation of the economy -- something that resulted in last 
year's results of the Slovak economy being worse than those of 
the Czech economy. 
  The Press and Information Department of the Government 
Office 
concludes its statement reacting to some statements by Vladimir 
Meciar by pointing out that his statements are creating 
preconditions for a radicalization of our society.

<F P=106> [Interview with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman by "the </F>
editors in chief of the Croatian press and HINA" at the 
Presidential Palace in Zagreb on 26 May, 1994: "`The World Also 
Needs a Stable Croatia'"] 
  [Text] On Thursday, the president of the Republic of 
Croatia, Franjo Tudjman, received the editors in chief of the 
Croatian press and HINA [Croatian News Agency] at the 
Presidential Palace. 
  On the occasion of Statehood Day, in a meeting which lasted 
for two hours, the president answered questions about most 
topical events regarding domestic and foreign politics of 
Croatia. 
  This (Unauthorized) interview with the president of the 
Republic of Croatia is published by VJESNIK in its entirety. 
  [Vladimir Vazdar, GLAS SLAVONIJE] Allow me to ask you the 
first question on behalf of my colleagues with regard to the 
upcoming holiday, Statehood Day. 
  Which events of the past four years would you say were 
crucial and confirmed the independence of Croatia, and which 
situation or event has threatened it most? 
  [Tudjman] In my opinion -- and I probably do have something 
to do with what you ask me -- the First Assembly of the HDZ 
[Croatian Democratic Community] was one of the most critical 
moments. 
  Why? Because at that point, I began implementing the program 
of fighting for the establishment of an independent, sovereign, 
and democratic Croatia at the time when not only the ruling 
party, the League of Communists, but also all other opposition 
parties -- as you well know -- considered the program dangerous, 
and when there was the danger that all those gathered around it 
would be arrested, not only myself, but all those around me. I 
think this was one of the most crucial moments. I thought we 
would not be arrested due to the situation in Croatia and abroad 
at the time and that it would be a decisive step in awakening 
the Croatian public to the program of gaining independence for 
Croatia. 
  Therefore, this was one of the most crucial dates in 
fighting 
for an independent, democratic Croatia. Of course, later on, we 
had to defend, preserve the established, declared independence 
of Croatia from the aggression of the Yugo-Communist army, 
Serbia, and Montenegro. May I remind you, ladies and gentlemen, 
that in 1991, both the domestic and international situations 
were adverse to an independent and sovereign Croatia. 
<H5>  25 September, 1991 </H5>
  Let me just remind you about two facts: On 25 September, 
1991, at the height of the rebellion of the Serbs in Croatia 
organized by the Yugo-Communist army and at the time when the 
Yugo-Communist army was on the offensive to overthrow Croatian 
authorities, not only to conquer Croatian territory in its 
entirety or achieve the minimalist program of 
Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag, but also to overthrow the Croatian 
authorities -- on 25 September, 1991, the UN Security Council 
adopted the resolution and imposed an arms embargo on Croatia, 
which was defending itself. 
  Naturally, the international factors that initiated the 
resolution knew Croatia was unarmed, and that the Yugo-Communist 
army, Serbia, and Montenegro had enough weapons for years of 
warfare. This resolution was imposed regardless of that, on 25 
September, and on 7 October the long-planned shelling of the 
Parliament Building, Presidential Palace took place, with the 
aim of making Croatia leaderless. 
  Therefore, those were critical days in fighting for the 
establishment of the sovereign and democratic Croatia. After we 
survived -- and may I remind you that some consuls general left 
Zagreb the day the parliament building was bombed, therefore 
they knew what would happen. [sentence as published] You have 
probably seen the fragments of shells and missiles, where they 
were made, which symbolizes the circumstances and conditions in 
which Croatia was being created. 
  After that -- to the surprise of many in the world and 
causing the astonishment of many at the fact that we survived -- 
the process of recognition began, and the real and formal 
recognition happened, as you know, at the beginning of 1992, and 
final recognition, in the real sense of the word, was achieved 
through the Washington agreement. 
  [Hloverka Novak-Srzic] Some, for example, say that the 
Croatian state has not yet been fully formed, for there are 
still international forces that harbor thoughts of various new 
unions. What do you think about that? 
  [Tudjman] I think this is a good question, based on facts. 
Some forces could not reconcile themselves to the fact that 
there was no more Yugoslavia, especially not to the creation of 
independent Croatia. 
  However, those forces are now marginal. Today, Croatia is 
recognized not only internationally and formally, its 
recognition is genuine, and today Croatia has friends and 
allies, from the United States, as the main superpower, which 
talks only about partnership with Croatia in all fields, to the 
most-populated superpower on the other end of the world, China; 
it has very good relations with most countries of the European 
Union; it has established good relations with Islamic countries 
as well, therefore, such intentions have no prospects at 
present, they have no realistic foundation for the realization 
of their plans, but they do exist. 
<H5>  Intricate Circumstances </H5>
  We must remember, however, that this world, Europe in the 
European Union, the main countries of the European Union, are 
not consistent with regard to the problem of former Yugoslavia 
in general, and therefore also with regard to Croatia, and then 
there are, of course, differences between European countries and 
the United States and Russia. Consequently, those circumstances 
are very intricate, but Croatia is, for the first time in its 
history, in a much better international position. 
  [Josip Jovic] The reputation of Croatia is improving, it is 
even gaining a certain economic stability; at the same time, we 
can even afford a political luxury: We are causing problems for 
ourselves, there are political conflicts, a parliamentary 
crisis, the disbanding of parliament is imminent, some say it 
will definitely happen. People wonder who [Stipe] Mesic and 
[Josip] Manolic [deputies who recently split from the HDZ] 
really are, and what they want. People do not understand that. 
  [Tudjman] Your question contains part of the answer: In 
these circumstances, we could really do without internal 
problems, the parliamentary and constitutional crisis; quite the 
contrary, we must remember that we need a stable Croatia. We 
needed, Croatia needed allies, it got them because of its 
democratic system, but international factors and our friends and 
allies also need a stable Croatia. 
  Therefore, the question of what Mesic and Manolic want and 
why is understandable. This is a problem that one could 
speculate about -- who needs to destabilize Croatia considering 
those circumstances -- and with regard to domestic politics, it 
is certain that Manolic and Mesic belonged to the so called 
left-wing of the HDZ. However, as we could see from many 
statements, particularly from those of Mr. Manolic, he never 
approached the central position of the HDZ from his communist 
positions, even positions of the service in which he spent most 
of his active political life. Differences exist in every party, 
and especially in the HDZ, which wanted to reconcile the divided 
Croats, and the sons of the Domobrani [Croatian wartime militia] 
and, globally speaking, the Ustashas extended their hands to 
Communists and partisans. Mr. Manolic has obviously not 
accepted that hand, but has even made statements, together with 
Boljkovac in particular, that those people who were born out of 
national ideas were pro-fascists, pro-Ustashas. 
  Manolic himself said -- I think he even connected it to the 
Washington agreement -- that this presents the final defeat of 
forces in the Croatian nation that were defeated already in 
1945. Consequently, this statement epitomizes the essence of a 
lack of understanding of the position of the Croatian nation and 
of the fact that we managed to establish Croatia because we 
formed such a movement that united the divided Croatianness, and 
that the Ustasha forces that headed the NDH [Independent State 
of Croatia] were defeated in 1945 for they tied their destiny to 
the fascist Italy and Nazi Germany and had pro-fascist politics 
that must be condemned. But we must never forget that hundreds 
of thousands of Croats were at Bleiburg, that those were not 
Ustashas, i.e. that there were least Ustashas among them, but 
that those were people from all parts of Croatia whose families 
were connected with the NDH as a Croatian state and not fascism, 
Nazism, and so forth. 

<H5>    Manolic Could Not Understand </H5>
  This is what he could not understand and he did not realize 
that most Croats wanted their own country at that time as well, 
nor the fact that the anti-fascist movement was stronger in 
Croatia than in other, not only former-Yugoslav country, but, 
ladies and gentlemen, we could even say that it was relatively 
the strongest in Europe, that this, again, stemmed from their 
yearning -- not from the communist orientation of the Croats for 
the idea of communism as such, but because the Communist Party 
fronted by Tito also had a program for Croatia as a federal 
state. 
  Therefore, this is a problem I talked much about and found 
proof of in historical facts, coming into conflict with 
greater-Serbian views long ago, not only with regard to 
Jasenovac and other cases. Furthermore, the program of creating 
a party-democratic program in Croatia, in developing Croatia, 
that I presented to the people they accepted in its entirety, 
which means Manolic and Mesic, as well as some of their 
followers, have not got used to that idea and that is why they 
dropped out. But, their dropping-out did not come as a 
surprise, especially considering the circumstances at the time 
when we were creating the HDZ and Croatia. 
  I think I have already mentioned this; nothing is new in 
history, and out of 12 apostles of Christ, one was a traitor, 
another failed him, and others, all but one, did not follow him 
on the Way of the Cross. All parties in the world, since their 
establishment, even in Croatia, were divided, and in the last 
century, Starcevic's Party of Rights was divided into pure 
right-wingers and Starcevic's right-wingers; the National Party 
was also divided, from an independent party to that of Radic and 
turncoats, and so forth. So turncoats -- Mesic, Manolic -- are 
no surprise in this group; they are a normal phenomenon in the 
transformation of the HDZ as a party that got the majority vote 
-- which in the beginning, was characterized as an all-national, 
democratic movement -- into a party, as we said at the Second 
Assembly, an all-Croatian, national party, not a narrow 
Christian-Democratic party, but a national party that bases its 
program activities on principles of Christian civilization, as 
we wrote and as I said at the Assembly. And that term is broad 
enough. 
  Generally speaking, people have realized that, and I can 
tell 
you -- among hundreds of letters of support I received from 
people, not only HDZ members, but also from ordinary citizens, 
ordinary citizens of all professions and all ages, from young 
people to college professors -- only one was negative. And I 
must admit it was a politically constructive letter. He told me 
he agreed with Manolic's decision to leave the HDZ. Why? 
Because the letter said he could not accept the program, 
decisions, and the HDZ leadership from the Second HDZ Assembly, 
because he could not accept the kuna as the Croatian currency, 
and because he could not accept a ditty like "God Save Croatia" 
as the hymn of the HDZ! 
  Therefore, this is the essence of Manolic's ideas and his 
followers. 
<H5>  Dragging Away Renegades </H5>
  I said less than 1 percent of party members would follow 
them 
as far as the party is concerned, and they have obviously failed 
to cause a rift in the parliament; rather by dragging away 
renegades, 10 deputies, the HDZ maintained its majority in both 
chambers. 
  And, ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you something -- 
stratification is good for every party, such stratification and 
turmoil are present everywhere and sometimes even amount to 
rifts. In the HDZ, therefore, there was no rift. It is good 
that parties are given shape, become stabilized, in this or that 
manner. However, it is good for Croatia to have a majority party 
in the parliament. 
  I claim the following: It would be easier for me, as the 
president of the country, not to be linked to any party. If I 
wanted to run for president at the next elections as well, my 
reputation is probably so good that my party affiliation would 
play no role in that. But the party I founded, to which I 
contributed its program and together with which I contributed to 
creating an independent and democratic Croatia, needs my party 
affiliation. As a historian, not only as the state leader of 
Croatia, I can say that if it had not been for such a majority 
party, we would not have had an independent Croatia; nor would 
we manage to establish it and defend it; nor would I be able to 
make decisions as we did in the times about which you partly 
spoke in your questions and in which we are still struggling. 
  Take other countries, from the Baltic countries to Poland, 
Slovenia, and Bulgaria, and you will see that the Communists 
have either regained power, or there are problematic coalitions 
that cannot make good political or economic decisions. Even the 
most serious economic experts from abroad, neutral to us, have 
said -- you have managed what you did in the field of domestic 
and foreign politics and economy because you had leadership, 
because you knew what you wanted, because the government could 
also rely on the majority. 
  Consequently, it is good that the parliamentary crisis 
caused 
by Manolic's and Mesic's defection preserved the situation in 
the Croatian Parliament, that the majority party is the party 
that won an overwhelming majority at the latest elections, that 
it is still in the majority, for Croatia's sake. 
  [Nenad Miculinic] Mr. President, as we speak, the 
parliamentary crisis is being aggravated. Last week, in 
Makarska, you said you were prepared, if there is no agreement 
between the HDZ and the opposition, to disband the parliament 
and address the Croatian nation. 
  Are you still prepared to do that, if no agreement is 
reached? Will you, then, disband the parliament and schedule 
early elections? Or, do you think it is possible to overcome the 
parliamentary crisis on the model that has lately been presented 
by the HDZ, so that the party that got the majority in the 
parliament, but that got about one-third of votes at the last 
elections, rules and does not even want to hear those 
representing other opinions, of parties that got the trust of 
the greater part of that same electoral body? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, there are a few things that are not 
true in your question. It is not true that the parliamentary 
crisis is getting worse. We have already overcome the 
parliamentary crisis. For, Manolic and Mesic, even those from 
the opposition who wanted to provoke parliamentary and 
constitutional crisis, have not managed to do that, but, as I 
said, the majority party has preserved the position that allows 
it to make decisions and secure the stability of both the 
parliamentary and executive authorities. And the second part of 
your question reflects, my dear sir, either your ignorance about 
the essence of parliamentary democracy or insufficient political 
education, or good intentions. What does it mean that the HDZ 
got one-third of the electoral body? How many people go to 
elections in the United States? About 50 percent or less, and 
the president is elected with 50 percent of those 50 percent of 
people who voted.... Do any Americans raise the question of the 
president being elected by only 25 percent of the electoral 
body? Only ignorant people and petty politicians raise that 
question in Croatia, those who have not yet accepted the 
reality; that Croatia became an independent, democratic, 
sovereign country and that the HDZ achieved that, together with 
people, and won the majority vote of the electorate that went to 
the polls, and the majority of the HDZ cannot be linked to those 
who voted both for the red and for the black [sentence as 
published]. That is not unity, the majority are those who 
voted, who gave their votes to one party. 
  Therefore, as I said, your question either reflects one of 
the above -- ignorance about the essence of parliamentary 
democracy, poor political culture, or a lack of good intentions 
-- or all of the above. 
  [Nenad Miculinic] No, it does not reflect any of that. The 
fact is, when we look at the results of the elections, the HDZ 
is.... 
  [Tudjman] You got the answer to your question. Let us 
proceed. 
  [Vladimir Vazdar] Allow me to ask you, can you comment on 
the contribution of Slavonia and the Slavonians in gaining 
independence and creating the democratic system of Croatia? 
  [Tudjman] Slavonia, particularly eastern Slavonia, is the 
one that suffered the first blow and that the Yugo-Communist 
army, i.e. Serbia too, wanted not only to conquer, but also to 
rob at all costs, and it was exposed to total ethnic cleansing. 
Slavonia gave an extraordinary contribution -- which is 
difficult to estimate at present -- to the preservation of the 
entire Croatia, to the fact that they did not succeed, in spite 
of the fact that they concentrated all their tank forces there, 
that they did not manage to conquer Vinkovci and Osijek; that 
speaks about the contribution of Slavonia, about the spirit of 
the Croatian nation in Slavonia, about our defensive war. 
  And, of course, the conclusion of that patriotic war, 
fighting for the liberation of eastern Slavonia will probably be 
the most difficult one, but there is no doubt in my mind that 
the Croats in Slavonia will then display both their maturity and 
readiness to do everything to integrate those parts, if possible 
without more casualties, with the help of the international 
community, but as I said, if necessary, also by using all 
available means. 
  [Vladimir Vazdar] With regard to that, let me mention 
hundreds of thousands of refugees and the fact that the key task 
of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in temporarily occupied areas 
has not been fulfilled. And this is still the reality 
preventing Croatia from assuming authority over its entire 
territory. 
  You have recently announced that the UNPROFOR mandate will 
not be extended. Do you hope the problem will be solved during 
the present mandate, or do you see another solution? 
  [Tudjman] You see, those Croatian areas under UN protection, 
which are actually occupied by the Serbs, also enable us to 
monitor the position of Croatia and international relations. 
  We should not turn a blind eye to the fact that the 
international community not only tolerated the aggression of the 
Yugo-Communist army and Serbia on Croatia, but that is was also, 
as I said, indifferent as to what would happen -- they simply 
thought Croatia was the main culprit for the collapse of 
Yugoslavia. Although, as far as the HDZ and myself are 
concerned, I have never said what Mesic wrote in his political 
wisdom "How I Was Breaking Yugoslavia." I knew that former 
Yugoslavia was a reality in the international system and that 
the international community was not inclined to doing away with 
that system, knowing what might result if it did. 
<H5>  If We Could Have Had Confederation... </H5>
  Therefore, my politics at that time proposed to solve the 
Yugoslav crisis by transforming federal Yugoslavia into a 
confederation. Consequently, my confederation proposal stemmed 
from my respect for international circumstances but, ladies and 
gentlemen, also from my desire for a sovereign Croatia, without 
losing lives. 
  For, if we could have formed a confederation, realize full 
sovereignty within a conferral union, without losing lives, then 
it would also accomplish the realization of Croatian, national, 
and democratic goals, for we could have made decisions about the 
future from the viewpoint of a confederation. 
  Consequently, when speaking about the problem of UNPA [UN 
Protected Area] zones, we must remember all those historic 
events from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, even remember that 
many international factors were and still are not completely 
inclined toward us. 
  But we have succeeded, we got the support of international 
factors; we have allies and the support of the main super power. 
We managed to get UN Security Council resolutions that 
guarantee our territorial integrity. And with regard to 
everything Serbia went through with sanctions, the hopelessness 
of its imperialistic politics to create a greater Serbia at the 
expense of Croatian territory, there is, I think, a 50:50 chance 
of beginning the process of normalization on the basis of the 
signed agreement on normalization. Again, we signed the 
agreement also because we were obliged to do so, from the Vance 
plan and the European Community, etc., because it was 
recommended to us by the latest Juppe-Kinkel proposal on a modus 
vivendi, for the proposal actually reverses my peace proposal; 
it obliges us to accept a political solution. 
  Therefore, we shall try to realize that normalization to 
which the representatives of Yugoslav and Serbian government and 
Milosevic have agreed personally by signing the agreement at the 
negotiating table in Geneva, not only in bilateral talks, but 
also at the negotiating table. They agreed to that, to have 
full normalization. Furthermore, we witnessed Belgrade arranging 
the elections in Krajina, around Hadzic, Martic, etc., and they 
even announced that Martic was elected to head the process of 
normalization, and now we witness Martic and Mikelic continuing 
to exacerbate the situation. 
<H5>  Simply Tactical Exacerbation? </H5>
  It remains to be seen whether that exacerbation will last or 
whether it is just tactical, connected with the situation in 
Bosnia. During talks on extending the current UNPROFOR mandate, 
we demanded the implementation of Resolution No. 769 on 
controlling borders between Croatia and Serbia, and Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the part of Bosnia-Herzegovina controlled by 
the Serbs. We were then told by our friends that the UN did not 
have enough forces to secure the borders at that time, but that 
they understood our proposals, that our demands were justified, 
and that they would be considered. 
  We will, therefore, do our best to see whether or not they 
want normalization. If they do not want it, we will take our 
demand to the United Nations and take other steps; the mandate 
will no longer be extended. You know that Foreign Minister 
Simic came to Zagreb and that our foreign minister was also 
supposed to visit Belgrade, but we said that would only happen 
after the road toward Belgrade is opened, i.e. the highway via 
Okucani, and when telephone communications are restored. They 
did not satisfy our demands and as long as they do not do that, 
until they really start the process of normalization, we will 
have to maintain an unbending attitude, because today we have 
250,000 refugees and we can no longer postpone solving their 
problem -- and we understand their personal and family problems, 
but there is also the problem of Croatian integrity, 
infrastructure, economic integrity, as well as integrity in 
terms of politics and security. 
  Anyhow, the world does not accept that the Serbs in Croatia 
have the right to self-determination, regardless of the fact 
that this demand of theirs is reiterated by not only their 
politicians, but also prominent intellectuals. The Serbs are a 
minority in Croatia, they are guaranteed all the rights of an 
ethnic community and we are prepared to give them territorial 
self-government in districts -- two districts where they had a 
majority before the war -- cultural autonomy throughout Croatia, 
we are prepared to make many concessions also partly as a result 
of their spreading rumors about the continuation of the NDH, 
etc. We are also willing to implement our Constitutional Law, 
the civic and ethnic rights of the Serbs, and have the 
implementation supervised by interested international factors, 
but with regard to that, let me tell you, as you are public 
persons who mold public opinion, in discussing the position of 
the Serbs in Croatia, people still mention the NDH in connection 
with those horrible figures that say at least 600,000 or 700,000 
Serbs were killed in Jasenovac. And the number of all 
casualties of all nationalities during World War II is less than 
that.... 
  Already in the 1950's, i.e. while I was in Belgrade, I 
objected to those lies and deceptions. Make an effort, take it 
to the press, to all the media, that there were not so many 
people killed in World War II in all of Yugoslavia; all 
partisans, Chetniks, Ustashas, Domobrans, in Jasenovac, in 
Bleiburg, and so forth, included. 
<H5>  Deceit as "Argument" </H5>
  Demographic loss is a different matter, I am talking about 
people killed during the war, and there were 597,000 of them, 
but I did not have that information while I was writing 
The Vastness of Historical Reality. Tell the public, 
publish that data in all your newspapers, dispel that myth and 
deception. For the Serbs base their allegedly justified Serb 
demands, fears, deceit, and so forth, on that. 
  [Josip Jovic] They will not negotiate, except outside 
Croatia. 
  [Tudjman] Knin will not see negotiations outside Croatia.... 
  [Josip Jovic] Those are their maneuvers.... 
  [Tudjman] Maneuvers... Lately, as opposed to the stalling 
of Martic and Mikelic and their unreasonable behavior, Milosevic 
has stated for Athens KATIMERINI that the solution is to solve 
the problem of the Serbs in Croatia like the problem of the 
Albanians in Kosovo. That is, so far, the most positive 
statement. Of course, we would immediately agree to giving the 
Serbs in Croatia rights equal to those of the Albanians in 
Kosovo. 
  [Branko Tudjen] To what extent is this vital and most 
painful problem of the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] zones related 
to the development and outcome of the situation in Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] It is extremely closely related, to the extent 
that our friends advise us to be patient and wait until it is 
solved. 
  The situation in Bosnia is bound up with the situation in 
the 
UNPA zones and many expect that the relations with the Serbs 
will change once the Bosnian question is solved within a 
framework of those draft proposals that are now being discussed, 
and that this will clear the way for making them give up their 
pretensions about annexing krajina to greater Serbia. 
  [Branko Tudjen] Do you think that Serbian imperialistic 
politics has now reduced its ambitions to what is being offered 
through Bosnia? 
  [Tudjman] I think -- and we were told that at the 
negotiating table as well -- that the world has realized there 
are 2 million Serbs on the other side of the Drina River and 
that the solution to the Bosnian problem would change the angle 
with regard to the problem in Croatia. I think they will accept 
the fact that the Serbs in Bosnia are one of three constituent 
nations. Consequently, they will also accept that the Serbs 
have a right to demand self-determination, but that they must, 
in turn, agree to solving the problem of the Serbs in Croatia on 
the basis of general principles of the international community, 
that national minorities and ethnic communities do not have the 
right to self-determination, but to civic and ethnic rights in 
accordance with international conventions. 
  [Mirko Bolfek] Mr. President, while we are on the subject 
of Bosnia, would you comment on current relations between the 
Muslims, i.e. the Bosniaks, and the Croats, and the fact that 
some say the Washington agreement is not entirely beneficial for 
all Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, i.e., on the fact that some say 
the agreement does not provide what it is supposed to provide 
for the Croats? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, regarding the Washington agreement, 
I must again point out that the signing of the agreement does 
not present a turning point in Croatian politics and my politics 
toward Bosnia-Herzegovina, but that it was exactly those 
politics that lead to the agreement and won over those allies 
that were not quite familiar with the situation. 
  I not only helped, but received several hundred 
representatives from all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina in this 
very building, and I told them to go to the referendum for the 
sake of Croatianness and Croatia. 
  Moreover, I not only accepted, but also initiated 
Cutilhiero's plan about cantonal solution. I initiated and 
contributed to the draft solution for provinces. You will 
remember that I dedicated days to some people who came to see me. 
<H5>  We Helped the Establishment of the Croatian Republic of </H5>
Herceg-Bosna 
  Of course they are against the secession of the republic of 
Srpska and oppose the view of a part of the Muslim leadership 
that if a unitarian Bosnia as a whole is not possible, they 
establish a separate Muslim state, that we helped the creation 
of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, and that it defended 
not only western Herzegovina and central Bosnia, but also other 
parts of Bosnia from the Serb aggression, and that Croat areas 
in central Bosnia be defended from the Muslim offensive, at the 
time when the Muslims were determined to create a Muslim state. 
[sentence as published] 
  Proof: After I signed both public and secret agreement on 
federation and confederation with Izetbegovic, he later on 
signed an agreement with the Serbs in which he said that if 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was to disintegrate, that real membership in 
the United Nations be transferred to the Muslim republic. 
  Furthermore -- I might have mentioned this already; I know I 
did, but I do not know whether it was published anywhere -- at 
one point Izetbegovic told me: "You can annex western 
Herzegovina to Croatia." I refused, for we wanted to defend the 
Croats in central Bosnia. 
  Consequently, the present agreement is beneficial for the 
survival of Croatianness in Bosnia. On the whole, it is more 
beneficial for the strategic interests of Croatia than if it 
simply joined western Herzegovina, but it is also causing 
problems due to the resistance and lack of trust on both the 
Muslim and the Croat sides, although generally speaking, we must 
admit that the agreement on the cessation of hostilities and on 
the implementation of the Washington agreement, regardless of 
the resistance on both sides, was, on the whole, accepted much 
better than we had anticipated considering our strained 
relations. 
  We can expect to encounter many problems, it will take good 
will on both sides to smooth over misunderstandings and regain 
trust. 
  I think most part of the Croatian nation and most 
responsible 
persons who lead that defensive war of Croatia in Bosnia will 
follow these politics and that the Muslims will also try to 
implement the agreement, simply because they realized that the 
world, both Western countries and the United States, were not 
well-disposed toward them. Not only that, they also rejected the 
idea about a unitarian Bosnia, for it is as impossible as 
creating a separate Muslim mini-state. They were advised -- to 
put it mildly, since I do not know what some of you will write 
-- to join the Croats, to connect with the Western civilization 
together with the Croats, that this was the only chance for 
their survival in these parts, and that this is in the interest 
of most Islamic countries as well. For most of them, as you 
know, have pro-Western governments -- actually 47 out of 51 
Islamic countries -- and it is in their interests not to have 
some extremist fundamentalist factions prevail in Bosnia, 
although there are, of course, such extremes in all Islamic 
countries, but, on the whole, they support the Croat-Muslim 
alliance in Bosnia and the confederation. 

<H5>    Overcoming the Historical Burden </H5>
  Between us, the Croats therefore have to overcome this 
historical burden of having been in a subordinate position or 
under hegemony in Bosnia all the time; both in the Muslim, 
Turkish, times and the Yugoslav times -- first under the Serb 
hegemony, and later under the Muslim. They have to learn to 
understand the reality that the U.S. professor, Dr. Boyd, 
presented -- he is said to be one of the top experts on 
international law, and he is paid by the Islamic countries and 
Islamic circles to be an advisor to Izetbegovic, that is, the 
Muslim leadership. After the Washington agreements he put 
together an analysis for Izetbegovic and the Muslim leadership, 
and called it The Memorandum. 
  There are 26 pages of text in this memorandum; it has 121 
items, and each sentence, item, or page, whatever you like, 
states that, with the Washington agreement, the new state 
formation, the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been put 
under the protectorate of Croatia by agreement, by the decision 
of the United States, Europe, and Russia. These are the words 
of this professor in this memorandum. Naturally, from these 
positions and certain Islamic points of view, he does not advise 
the Muslims to accept that. 
  The Croats must overcome that negative 
historical-psychological-political heritage; they must realize 
that, with this federation, they are really becoming equal, and 
they must learn to manage this federation on an equal basis, and 
learn that through the confederation, that is, the confederate 
relations with Croatia, they have full guarantees that they will 
not be tricked. 
  This is favorable for Croatianness in Bosnia as a whole, as 
over 90 percent of the Croats in Bosnia are in the federation, 
and, connected to Croatia, this is, from the geopolitical 
strategic point of view, in the interests of both Croatianness 
in Bosnia and the Croatian state, in the economic and every 
other aspect. We coordinated the interests of the Croat people 
with the interests of international forces on this issue, with 
regard to the eternal divisions of interest spheres in these 
areas. 
  As you know, Croatianness was suppressed in Bosnia in the 
demographic aspect too, and, faced with the population expansion 
of the Muslim population, this placed great demands on the Croat 
politics: the demand to know this strategic position, to know 
how to make us of it without letting the negative aspects 
prevail. 
  [Josip Jovic] The cantonal demarcation has stirred up 
discontent. Was it possible to gain more in these negotiations? 
  [Tudjman] For heaven's sake, we did gain.... The issue 
there was central Bosnia; we could have gotten the separate 
canton of Novi Travnik, Vitez, Busovaca, Kiseljak, Kresevo, but 
it would not have been connected with the other parts. This way 
we got both Jajce and Travnik into a mixed canton -- and 
everything we have listed -- and this way this canton borders 
with a purely Croat canton and a mixed canton. 
  The greatest noise was raised about the mixed canton of 
Mostar, the Mostar-Neretva canton, concerning Medjugorje. I 
said that it was precisely the fact that Medjugorje was going to 
be there that was proof to the Croats there, to us, and to the 
foreigners who are going to come there that it is not only a 
Muslim, but also a Croat canton -- more Croat, if you like -- 
and Mostar must have the main Croat institutions and the Croat 
university, the Croat theater, the Croat soccer club, and the 
institutions of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna until the 
federation comes into effect, and later of the canton, and the 
great county [velezupa]. The problem is us; we must know how to 
make use of it. This European Union management, headed by 
Koschnik and his team, will surely not oppose, it will not be 
against the Croat interests. 
  From the strategic point of view, this demarcation is 
therefore favorable for Croatia, but the Croats must accept 
their position; they are no longer subordinated, but they will 
be the ones who will participate in the management. 
  [Kresimir Fijacko] All this presupposes political stability 
in Zagreb. How do you see the way out of what has been 
happening with the parliament, which is surely not contributing 
to the stability? As president of the state, what can you do, 
what do you intend to do, and what do you think should be done? 
  [Tudjman] First of all, I said that this parliamentary 
crisis has in fact been overcome. At this table I said to all 
the party leaders, not only of the majority party, but also of 
the opposition, that Croatia has achieved a favorable 
international position in the present-day world with the 
stability, the democratic system, but also that the world needs 
a stable Croatia, and that everyone had their own share of 
responsibility in that respect. 
<H5>  Italian Imperialism </H5>
  The problem of the stability of Croatia is at present posed 
from a special point of view; that regarding the results of the 
elections in Italy, where the representatives of the parties 
that are at present in power made open statements about 
tutorship, about Istria, Rijeka, and Dalmacija having been 
historically and culturally Italian, which means that they have 
a right to them.... Therefore, it is particularly the gentlemen 
in the Rijeka NOVI LIST who should bear in mind that we are 
faced with the constant presence of Italian imperialism and 
irredentism, which are connected to the Serbian aspirations, 
with the visits to Knin, Baranja, and so on. 
  However, let us go back -- it is necessary to do everything 
for Croatia to remain a stable country with regard to its 
democratic system. The international community has not paid 
much attention to Manolic and Mesic's being renegades, because 
in fact they considered Manolic a proof that we have not done 
enough about decommunizing both the majority party and Croatia. 
  I believe that the crisis they wanted to provoke has in 
fact been overcome, that the majority party is prepared to abide 
by the agreement, which states that the majority party has the 
right to have its members as chamber presidents; they have been 
elected -- that is a fact -- and the majority party is prepared 
to have deputy presidents from the opposition, as has been 
stated. However, this agreement does not mean that nine party 
leaders can determine that -- it is unconstitutional, and does 
not comply with democratic parliamentary practice. 
  Let the majority party and the opposition parties nominate 
the candidates that the parliament as such will accept, and the 
majority party will not make proposals for these positions; it 
could impose its solutions, but it will not -- let the gentlemen 
nominate candidates that will win the majority of the HDZ 
representatives too, and vote according to their conscience and 
the responsibility to their voters. It seems to me that 
prudence will prevail and that the opposition parties will 
acknowledge the election of the chamber presidents that has been 
carried out, and that the parliamentary activities regarding the 
election of the chamber deputy presidents and the drawing up of 
the new rules of procedure on the parity basis, in the spirit of 
the democratic principles in the European and other countries, 
which will then be submitted to the parliament, will continue. 
An agreement on the new number and members of parliament 
committees, which we had agreed upon, was reached, and I think 
that sense will prevail among the opposition too -- though you 
know that they were not united either in their positions or in 
electing Manolic -- and that the parliamentary activities will 
continue under normal conditions. 
  At any rate, I can tell you this: There were even 
representatives from the opposition parties who said that they 
did not consider that important, that each parliament in the 
world is managed in a democratic way, on the majority basis. 
<H5>  The Majority Party and the Majority </H5>
  One of the opposition representatives said that if the 
majority party does not know how to make use of its majority, 
then it proves that it is not capable of ruling. We have 
received some similar statements from foreign observers too. 
  But I will tell you something, ladies and gentlemen. The way 
you have interpreted this parliamentary crisis in your media.... 
Croatia needs a stable democratic system to resolve its 
important problems, to liberate the occupied territories, and to 
be able to participate efficiently in the talks regarding the 
crisis and all the international positions; it does not need 
destabilization. 
  Instead of saying "parliament without opposition," you could 
have nicely said that a new parliamentary chairman has been 
elected, because he has indeed been legally elected. You are 
also responsible for creating public opinion in the sense that 
our people are able to understand what it means to have a state 
of one's own. 
  We can have internal differences, but we can not create the 
term "unstable Croatia." Who needs an unstable Croatia? 
Remember, gentlemen, this West, this democratic West has given 
billions of dollars to Yeltsin to establish the democratic 
system -- you know how, you witnessed the tanks aimed against 
the parliament and so on. Therefore, there are realities in 
international life, there are problems that the international 
community needs to solve to prevent a world conflict, or 
regional conflicts, and so on. 
  I repeat, it was because Croatia knew what it wanted, 
because 
it had a more stable system than any other former socialist 
country -- in which the Communists have been coming back, or the 
coalitions are inefficient -- that it has gained trust, but also 
because it was stable, because the world also needs a stable 
Croatia. 
  Therefore, I am asking you, not for the sake of the 
interests 
of the party, but for the sake of the interests of the Croat 
people. [sentence as published] For the consciousness of what 
it means to build a state and what needs to be invested in it, 
to prevail over the negative, centuries-old heritage in which 
even intellectual minds were forced to serve foreign masters -- 
from Venice to Vienna, Budapest, and Belgrade -- therefore, to 
build a democratic Croatia and this responsibility, that is 
truly not an easy job. 
  [Hloverka Novak-Srzic] In the context of the attempt at 
destabilizing Croatia that you spoke about, what is your comment 
on the fact that some of the critics of the Croatian state do 
not criticize the real problems -- the improvement of democracy 
and economy, or Croatia entering Europe -- as much as you 
personally? I am talking about the letter of the six, [former 
president of the Croatian Rights Party] Paraga's letter to the 
U.S. Congress, and the two letters that we have heard that 
Manolic and Mesic wrote. What is your comment on that; why is it 
so? 
  [Tudjman] If there were no Tudjman, there would be no HDZ, 
there would be no Croatia. Therefore, if the attempt on the 
Presidential Palace had succeeded, which it did not thanks only 
to circumstances, it is clear what would have happened. 
  [Miroslav Ivic] President Tudjman, war profiteering and now 
the irregularities in the transformation process have been 
irritating the public and stirring up disunion, which is 
contrary to what is necessary. Do you think that enough has 
been done to prevent this from spreading, and what is your 
assessment of the activities of the bodies in charge of that? 
  [Tudjman] You know that, during several government sessions 
that I chaired, I dedicated some special time to the problem of 
fighting all criminal activities, of eliminating the old 
bureaucratic remnants at all levels, but especially the criminal 
activities. Naturally, there are problems, and not enough has 
been done. 
<H5>  Inevitable Criminal Activities </H5>
  However, gentlemen, such things are inevitable even in 
countries that have never had any other systems but the free 
market system -- or capitalist countries, if you like -- and 
that had state management for centuries. 
  Let us be aware of the fact that it is precisely on the 
free market where the ruthless relations are in force, and that 
in legal conditions you also have people who can cope and those 
who cannot cope, and that there is underground mafia in any 
situation, even in the most normal countries, so to speak -- not 
only in Italy, but also Germany, the United States, Japan -- 
countries that have not undergone such turmoil as Croatia has. 
  Therefore, with the breakup of the former Yugoslav community 
a number of Yugo-unitarians, Yugo-integrationists were affected, 
and they remained in Croatia. The same goes for the breakup of 
socialism. A very large level of people was connected to the 
socialist structures, and they remained here, partly 
dissatisfied with the new situation. Even when they became 
involved in the structures of the democratic authorities, they 
were subversive and tried to use their positions for their 
purposes, for turning the wheel of history in the opposite 
direction again. 
  And then there was the transformation of the socialist, 
nobody's property -- state property -- into private property. 
This is a problem that humanity had never faced before, and it 
has not been completely resolved anywhere yet. As the free 
market was being formed, so was this capitalist society the 
wild-west way, the mafia, and so on. Were the Fords and all the 
other international magnates established by being clerks, 
sitting at their desks, like the others, the majority of the 
citizens? We must understand that; a much more stratified, more 
political, and more scientific approach to this problem should 
be taken. 
  On the one hand there is the fighting against criminal 
activities, and on the other we should see that in this 
transformation, the transition from the socialist system to the 
free market system, some people will inevitably become rich, and 
some will not. We must also understand that while we have to 
fight all the criminal activities, there will be no rich Croatia 
without rich Croats. We must understand that. 
  There is this very interesting phenomenon of the real 
mistakes being used for petty political pusposes, instead of 
seeing to the transformation being carried out as soon as 
possible, and achieving stability in that respect, both for the 
sake of internal development and external relations. 
  These old structures are a special problem, as are the old 
views, and the Yugo- and socialist resistance to the return of 
the Croat emigrants. We still do not have any information as to 
whether, at present, there are as many Croats abroad as there 
are in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, or at least two thirds of 
that number. 
  However, it was clear to me from the very beginning that a 
great part of the Croat people have been abroad from the last 
century, and that if we do not bring them back, the Croat people 
and Croatia will not be able to survive. If we let these people 
stay abroad, they will continue to pull away the others -- there 
is no house, no home, that does not have a relative abroad. If 
we do not create the conditions for these people to come back, 
they will continue to leave, and Croatia is depopulated as it 
is. Father Bakovic may get on some people's nerves, but there 
are more coffins than cradles in most of Croatia, if you please. 
  Therefore, the return of the emigrants should be facilitated 
through transformation. 
<H5>  Resistance to Emigrant Investment </H5>
  I must admit that I have not received much support in this. 
There has been some in the HDZ, but not in the structures that 
are in the opposition parties. There is so much resistance to 
the investments of our emigrants that they did not accept 
Luksic, the richest man in South America -- not only Chile, but 
South America -- and one of the 100 richest people in the world. 
After I had received him, after he had even sent his sons who 
are there, and after he had expressed his readiness to invest, 
they would still not take him. They resisted it so much that 
they almost threw him out. 
  And now this Geofizika [Croatian company]. There are three 
Croats from California who are willing to buy it for more money 
than Ina [Croatian oil company], which initially stated it was 
not interested, and now these structures in Ina -- which have 
been there since the Communist regime, you know -- are saying it 
is treason, and so on. Because there are three Croats who, 
between us, are doing similar things for us in the United 
States, they can not do it. So then it is said to be a crime of 
the party in power, and so on. 
  I received a letter from a man in Germany, who said he had 
three children, and that he had offered 1.75 million German 
marks [DM] for a company.... If we do not achieve that, Croatia 
will not exist in the future, for the reasons I have stated. As 
soon as this practise is abandoned, there are immediately 
announcements that this is underhand dealing or whatever. 
  This is a problem in which on the one hand we must fight 
absolutely for the rule of law, and against any crime, but on 
the other hand we must be aware of the fact that if this 
Zvonimir Boban [Croatian soccer player for AC Milan in Italy] 
has sold his legs for DM16 million or dollars -- German marks, 
and if he wants to invest that money in Croatia, it should be 
made possible. They have preventing him from doing so for a 
year, and labeled him a Herzegovinian, or whatever. 
  Therefore, this is an issue of a conflict between those who 
came from the former management that is holding the structures 
in certain companies, and even in the state management. We were 
at war, and if we had made changes in these structures, the 
Croat people would have become disunited, a civil war would have 
occurred, and so on. Therefore, we carried out the correct 
policy of non-revanchism, of unity, but even with these great 
difficulties we must overcome the resistance both to private 
enterprise and to emigrant investment, which to me primarily 
means the return of our people. We should bring them back, and 
not have them leave. 
  However, I think that this is a process that cannot be 
stopped. I personally know about 100 young people who were born 
abroad. Eventually, we managed to appoint Mr. Blazevic, who was 
born in Argentina, to be assistant to Penic, to put an end to 
this resistance. There have been some positive trends, but 
there have also been some negative ones. Some people who were 
in the state management, in some ministries, went back to 
Australia, so I brought them back, and there were some who were 
disappointed with the relations in the transformation process, 
so I had to make personal interventions over and over again, 
and, as you see, it is a difficult process. It also includes 
the denationalization problem. Other countries have not yet 
managed to resolve that either, but from the very beginning my 
position toward the denationalization problem -- which is the 
only correct one -- has been that we should return what we can 
immediately, but not do more injustice than has already been 
done. So, in the cases in which we cannot return the property 
we should offer adequate compensation, proportional to the 
possibilities. 
<H5>  We Are a Little Impatient </H5>
  This was clear to me in 1990, but, as you can see, it is 
difficult. We have in fact not yet made any significant 
progress in the issue of the new role of the Chamber of 
Commerce, which should be the moving force in all these issues. 
However, you all know that you and I are paying 0.8 percent to 
the Chamber of Commerce -- I do not know whether it is from 
gross or net income. I found it clear as early as in 1990 that 
this is not necessary, but none of the heads of the Chamber of 
Commerce have implemented this so far. The Chamber of Commerce 
must either be a chamber of tradesmen or industrialists, and 
they should make voluntary contributions, instead of us paying 
for this to continue.... This is an example of both 
authoritarian power and of a difficult problem to solve. You 
know, we are a little impatient, though. It all takes time, it 
takes a good law -- it cannot simply be copied. 
  [Josip Jovic] There are certain individuals, let us put it 
that way, who are very highly placed in the political sense, and 
are involved in various suspicious activities, and I do not see 
any reason why this is tolerated. I think they are also 
misusing your moral credibility. 
  [Tudjman] I had two ministers removed from office when I 
learned they were involved in such things. I am in favor of 
finding out about this, of throwing them out, and not only 
shaming them, but also taking them to court. But here things 
are politicized in such a way as to ask for [Defense] Minister 
Susak's resignation with no justification -- if the situation 
were normal, then he would have been replaced after the 
explosion at Duboki Jarak [near Zagreb; a military warehouse], 
not because he would be directly responsible, but for political 
responsibility. However, I know that there are about 10 other 
people there who are directly responsible for what happened, and 
I know that the demand for his resignation was not caused by 
this, but because I could carry out Croatian state policies in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina through him, which included organizing the 
resistance to both aggressions in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
removal of the people who had become obstacles to these policies 
-- and you know who they are. 
  You see, things are politicized, and given other meanings, 
or 
they are simply misused for petty political purposes. As far as 
Mrs. Girardi [minister of culture and education] is concerned, 
the organization of the teachers' strikes was connected to this 
entire destabilization action, to the provoking of the 
parliamentary and constitutional crisis, to what they intended 
to do later. So Minister Girardi was then held responsible for 
the whole affair. Anyone else could be better at any position, 
if only they could find such people. 
  The problem of liberating the occupied territories is not 
simple. You probably remember that I said that I did not receive 
support even from those people from Croatia and abroad who 
favored me. They threatened that the sanctions would be 
extended to Croatia if I started liberating Maslenica. I did so 
anyway, again on the basis of the judgment that they would not 
do it because they need us, and that we should prove that we can 
carry out independent policies. 
  We must solve the internal problems in as painless a way as 
possible; I have been saying that the instances of particularly 
heavy crime should be found out about and dealt with, but in as 
painless and efficient a way as possible, which is not easy. 
And then you have these reproaches to the authorities.... I 
said that the documentation on what the members of the majority 
party have gotten in the transformation and on what the others 
have gotten should be prepared, and it will be prepared, and all 
the information should be presented. 
<H5>  Consistent Observation of the Law </H5>
  Only when we have resolved the problem of the occupied 
territories, and when the war in Bosnia ends will we be able to 
start resolving the problems of consistent and absolute 
observance of the regularities and democracy, with all our 
forces and all our energy. 
  The courts made decisions on releasing Arkan and Hadzic, and 
I did not know about it, so those who now provoked the crisis 
must have known about it. On 17 August 1990, when I was 
returning from the track-and-field championship in Split, I 
heard that Martic [president of the republic of Serb Krajina] 
was there, so I ordered that a commando unit be sent to Knin to 
break up the meeting, and if they had done that, things would 
have been different -- I am not saying that they would be much 
different, but there would have been some difference. Those who 
wanted to provoke a crisis now are the ones who did that. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, managing the Croatian state in these 
circumstances is a very demanding job. However, I am not at all 
pesimistic. 
  [Branko Tudjen] Perhaps something else about the stability 
of the government: Will there be any changes? 
  [Tudjman] These are only petty political insinuations, 
they are an attempt to provoke, just like what the papers were 
saying at the time -- that Domljan, Greguric, and Valentic would 
join Manolic.... As you can see, the government is stable, 
prime minister Valentic is completely following my state 
politics, and there is no instability. There are no problems 
about whether there will be any changes, individual ones, 
because of some needs.... 
  [Nenad Miculinic] President Tudjman, since the issue of the 
Day of Statehood has been raised, and since the opening of the 
monument to Croatian freedom has been planned at Medvedgrad, I 
would like to ask you for a comment on the announcement of the 
church authorities, which says that the representatives of the 
church will not participate, and that no church ceremony has 
been planned for the occasion of opening the facility you have 
called "the altar of the homeland." The Catholic Information 
Agency issued the announcement last week. 
  [Tudjman] You do issue various sorts of information in your 
announcements.... To my knowledge, Cardinal Kuharic, as 
president of the Bishops' Conference, will be present on the 
occasion, and these are therefore only speculations about a 
conflict between the church and the state. I think that a 
misunderstanding has occurred, that some of the church people 
perhaps thought that this monument should not be called `the 
altar of the Croatian homeland,' because altars belong in the 
church.... 
  However, that is not true -- we primarily wanted a place at 
which honor would be paid to all those who lived and died for 
Croatia, and this is not an altar in the classical sense. You 
let all sorts of things be published, it is shameful. We have 
not only saved Medvedgrad in the most authentic sense, which is 
already known, but we also assigned a purpose to it, and created 
a place where, on the elements of the Croatian coat of arms 
[reference to the sculpture at Medvedgrad], the Croatian 
homeland would be honored by all the foreign statesmen and 
foreign delegations.... We thought that the most suitable name 
was precisely "the altar of the Croatian homeland." We also 
considered "the altar of Croatian freedom," but we finally 
decided, in a wider circle, during an intellectual, political 
consideration of the issue, that it should be "the altar of the 
Croatian homeland." Some may have thought that it was just an 
altar, but it is not. You have an altar in Rome and somewhere 
else too, I do not know the Italian word for altar, and there 
have been similar terms -- pro patria, for instance. 
<H5>  There Are No Residences </H5>
  We will have a special agreement on whether consecration is 
necessary, but it is not an issue, as the cardinal is going to 
be present. You will see that it will be a unique monument. We 
will revive this Medvedgrad, the appearance of which between the 
13th and 15th century nothing is known about. As far as the 
concrete support that they have been writing about is concerned, 
whenever you restore something, you put the concrete and the 
frame inside that could endure an earthquake, and on the outside 
the facing is done according to the authentic design. This is 
the case everywhere in the world. This will be a monument with 
a nice view of the capital, it will be a successful solution, as 
it will have been put to a purpose with much less money than is 
being talked about, and there are no residences there.... 
  We may differ in everything, but we must realize that we did 
not get a state in an easy way, nor will it be preserved if we 
do not know how to preserve it. States are like homes, 
families: They disintegrate and disappear, and we must realize 
that. From the point of view of our geopolitical position, we 
are where we are. Let me mention one more thing: The recent 
ideas presented by certain political circles -- not only the IDS 
[Istrian Democratic Congress], but also some others, regarding 
regionalism, the federal state of Croatia... for the first time 
in history we have achieved unity, and should we now, with the 
Italian irredentism for Istria, Hungarian for Medjimurje, 
proclaim regions of, say, Dalmatia, Slavonia, and give rise to 
speculation? 
  Somebody told me that we have been reproached for not having 
put Gaj [leader of the Illyrian Movement] or Strossmayer 
[bishop, promoter of Pan-Slavism] on the new notes. So, in 
relation to what has not been overcome, which I discussed 
earlier, now we should continue to spread the Illyrian Movement 
and Yugoslavianism! 
  Therefore, we have not made any strategic mistakes in that 
respect. 
  There have also been statements that the kuna will not be 
accepted. Who will not accept the kuna? Why were the names of 
the mark, lira, franc, and other currencies not changed then -- 
they were also used under occupation. The kuna was the means of 
payment in the Croatian lands from Slavonia to the island of 
Cres. Moreover, we have it [kuna -- marten] on the Croatian coat 
of arms of Slavonia, and Slavonia was at a time the state term 
for the whole of Croatia. 
  And now I am expected to give in on this.... 
  [Branko Tudjen] It is better to have a marten than a 
badger [in Croatian, badger is jazavac; the name of a satirical 
theater in Zagreb]. 
  [Tudjman] Have they changed the name of Jazavac? In Jazavac 
they prepared a blue night: return the holy name of Dinamo 
[reference to a play; Dinamo -- the former name of a soccer club 
at present called Croatia]. This is also part of the action 
aimed at destabilizing Croatia. 
  I told them in 1990 to change the name. My idea was to have 
it done right away. Then last year they said they would change 
it back. I said no. It will not be called Dinamo. In Dinamo 
lies the symbol of what Croatianness has gone through from World 
War II, from Bleiburg, when 100,000 Croat people were forced 
into death marches, to Jugoton, Jugoriba, Jugokeramika, 
Jugoexport, Jugovinil, Jugoplastika, Jugodugme [factories and 
industries]... in Croatia. 
  On the other hand, Dinamo was in all the socialist countries 
and in the West a synonym of the pro-regime, pro-KGB, pro-secret 
service clubs. There is still a Dinamo in Tirana and one in 
Pancevo. And we are supposed to change it back?! Try to 
explain what it means to these young men who do not know 
anything. As long as this Croatia exists, there will be no 
going back to Dinamo. 
  [Hloverka Novak-Srzic] The name was changed two weeks ago. 
  [Tudjman] Was it in Jazavac or in Kerempuh [a theater in 
Zagreb, originally a character of a Croatian poem]? 
  [Unidentified] In Kerempuh. 
  [Tudjman] The first performance of the play in which there 
appears the demand that the name be changed back to Dinamo was 
in Kerempuh. There -- you see, this is the state of affairs 
here.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 2 Jun -- Borislav Mikelic, prime minister 
of the government of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], today 
denied reports that representatives of the RSK and Croatia were 
going to resume talks in Athens, Greece. "We have not yet fixed 
a location and date for further negotiations between Knin and 
Zagreb. I am not sure how some news organizations have come up 
with reports that this is going to take place in Athens," 
Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio. 
  "Our attitude is known anyway; anywhere except in Germany or 
within Croatia's borders," Mikelic added. He stressed that he 
was waiting for the next meeting with cochairmen Owen and 
Stoltenberg which will probably take place next week in Geneva. 
"Only when we have presented our arguments and heard their 
opinion will we decide where to hold further negotiations," 
Mikelic said. 
  The RSK prime minister said that the dispute over where to 
hold talks "increasingly resembles a match that is under way." 
[as received] He accuses the three EU ambassadors who released a 
six-point statement in Knin in early May, thereby prejudicing a 
political solution, of stalling the negotiations. Asked by the 
Obrenovac Radio presenter about a possible alliance between 
Italy and the RSK, Mikelic said that he would soon meet Italian 
Prime Minister Berlusconi and that he saw no reason why Krajina 
should not cooperate with one of Europe's economic powers. 
  "At the moment Croatia should pay more attention to Dalmatia 
and Istria than to us. First, we are another country. Second, 
they should save whatever can be saved. Certainly, the Kuna 
will not save them but let Europe witness where Croatia has 
ended up under the leadership of the Croatian Democratic Union," 
Mikelic told Obrenovac Radio.

<F P=106> [Report by Wojciech Zaluska] </F>
  [Text] Lech Walesa is willing to be reelected but he 
has no political backing. Currently, he can only count on the 
weak Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms. And it is becoming 
increasingly clear that his rapport with the party makes no 
sense. A divorce before the elections is possible. 
  So far, Walesa's attempts to win the favors of "Solidarity" 
have come to nothing. The president blocked popiwek [enterprise 
tax on above-normative pay] but the trade union did not agree. 
And it may never. There are both enthusiastic supporters and 
fanatic opponents of Walesa in "Solidarity." The former are 
blocking the latter's measures, and so far -- successfully. 
  So what is the president counting on? Most probably, he is 
counting primarily on television. Through television, he wants 
to reach out to society ... over the heads of politicians. So 
he is fighting like a lion for access to television. 
<H5>  Competitors Are Waiting </H5>
  Walesa's most serious competitors -- Aleksander Kwasniewski 
with 16 percent and Waldemar Pawlak with 9 percent -- have so 
far not submitted their candidacies. They will definitely try 
to postpone the decision until the last moment. By declaring 
their participation in the race, they will initiate a war with 
the Belveder. The war will paralyze the government's routine 
proceedings, so the later it begins, the better. 
  Being front-page politicians, Kwasniewski and Pawlak do not 
have to rush things. They are popular, and they have strong 
party structures to back them. 
  Could they give up trying to win the presidency for 
themselves? Yes, they could. There are more candidates waiting 
in the back room: In the Democratic Left Alliance, it is Sejm 
Speaker Jozef Oleksy (3 percent), while in the Polish Peasant 
Party -- Deputy Sejm Speaker Jozef Zych. 
<H5>  Party Primaries </H5>
  Among post-"Solidarity" parties, the slogan of having just 
one candidate of the post-1980 August Poland is popular. But so 
far, not much has happened -- it remains just a slogan. 
"Primaries" are taking place in the parties and coalitions. 
  Only the Alliance for Poland (Christian-National Union, 
Center Accord, Peasant Accord, Movement for the Republic, 
Conservative Coalition) has come up with a candidate. It is 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Professor Adam Strzembosz (4 
percent). 
  In the Freedom Union [UW], two names appear most often: 
Leszek Balcerowicz (4 percent) and Jacek Kuron (4 percent). 
Each man has different ideas for reforms. By choosing one of 
them, UW members will choose the party's image. If they decide 
in favor of Balcerowicz, then UW will become a party of "friends 
of the market" while if they choose Kuron, then UW will become a 
party of "friends of the people." 
  It is a choice which a large part of UW members wants to 
avoid making. Balcerowicz is "too liberal" while Kuron is "too 
social democratic" for them. 
  So it cannot be ruled out that it will be... Hanna Suchocka 
again. It could also be Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Bronislaw 
Komorowski, or Andrzej Zoll. 
<H5>  Whose Names Does "Solidarity" Whisper? </H5>
  "Solidarity" is also talking about some candidates. The 
names of Zbigniew Romaszewski and Jan Olszewski are being 
mentioned. Both of them have been involved in establishing a 
"Solidarity"-type political party. Their campaign could help 
promote such a party. 
  But Marian Krzaklewski, the trade union's chairman, is not 
among enthusiasts of such a party. He is strong enough to 
successfully block both candidacies. Will he submit his own 
candidacy?

<F P=106> [Report by "J.T.P.": "Coalition Leads; CBOS on Local </F>
Elections"] 
  [Text] It can be concluded from a May poll conducted 
by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] that about 41 
percent of eligible voters will take part in the upcoming local 
elections. This would mean that this year's turnout will not be 
different from that of four years ago when 42 percent of the 
voters decided to vote. But because the poll was conducted a 
month before the elections, the situation may still change. 
  According to responses given by respondents in the first 
half 
of May, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] leads among the parties 
running in the elections, with 16 percent, followed by the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] (15 percent), the Freedom Union 
[UW] (12 percent), and the Union of Labor [UP] (10 percent). In 
the second half of May, 21 percent of those polled wanted to 
vote PSL, 12 percent for SLD, and 15 percent for UW. The 
remaining parties would gain fewer than 3 percent of the votes. 
But the largest group of respondents could not make up their 
minds regarding any party. When one compares that with results 
from the previous elections, one can conclude that UW and SLD 
have the most faithful electorates, with the Union for Real 
Politics and the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms having 
gained the greatest number of new supporters; from among the big 
parties, the highest number of new supporters was gained by UP, 
while the smallest number -- by UW. These results must however 
be approached with great caution since a big part will be played 
in the local elections by local election committees, with 
political parties being behind some of them. After taking into 
account the participation in the elections of local committees 
(for which many voters would prefer to vote instead of the 
parties), one can state that PSL should gain at least 10 percent 
in the elections, SLD -- 9 percent, UW -- 7 percent, UP -- 5 
percent, while the coalition with the participation of the 
Christian-National Union -- 4 percent. 
  So these results are different from some data on election 
preferences in parliamentary elections that were published in 
Tuesday's RZECZPOSPOLITA and that were collected by the 
Sopot-based Social Research Institute [Pracownia Badan 
Spolecznych]. If parliamentary elections were to take place 
today, they would be won by SLD, followed by UW, and PSL (which 
has the biggest chances for the local elections) coming third. 
It is obvious that both polls were conducted on different kinds 
of voters and they apply to different situations, and that is 
most probably how the differences came about. 
  Forty-five percent of those polled evaluated the performance 
of the outgoing gmina councils very well or just well (during 
the May poll), while 29 percent said their assessment was 
"rather bad" or "very bad." Local authorities have for a long 
time been the authorities institutions gaining the best public 
assessments of all. In an April poll, their performance was 
positively evaluated by 57 percent of those polled. Despite 
that, the biggest group of the polled will tend to vote in favor 
of changes rather than in favor of a continuation when it comes 
to personnel composition of gmina councils. They do not have 
high praise for the importance of local elections, either. 
  The poll was conducted during 7-10 and 19-23 May, using a 
representative random sample of adult residents of Poland.

  [Text] The government held its regular weekly session 
today. Some of the session was dedicated to relations between 
Slovenia and Croatia, especially in light of President Milan 
Kucan's announced visit to Zagreb. He is expected to travel 
there on 7 June. As it is customary, a news conference was held 
after the session. Our colleague Nadja Pengov was mostly 
interested in relations between Slovenia and Croatia: 
  [Begin Pengov recording] The government conclusions were 
explained by Foreign Ministry State Secretary Peter Vencelj, who 
said the following: Matija Malesic, Slovene ambassador to 
Croatia, yesterday met with Croatian Prime Minister Valentic. 
Nikica Valentic told our ambassador that Croatia will continue 
with the construction of a border crossing near Secovlje and 
that the border crossing will be finished before the beginning 
of the tourist season. Work is underway and should be completed 
by the end of the week. Nikica Valentic here also said that he 
was aware of the controversial nature of the construction, 
however, that Croatia can no longer wait for a resolution of 
this problem. The information received indicates that Croatia 
is not inclined to the Slovene proposal regarding Secovlje and 
sailing in Piran Bay -- according to which temporarily, until 
this issue is finally resolved, Croatia would assume the manning 
of the Secovlje border crossing while Slovenia would supervise 
all of Piran Bay. The final verdict on this will be given by 
the Croatian Government at the session that started today at 
noon. 
  Bearing in mind that the conclusions of the Croatian 
Government are not known at this moment, our government has 
decided not to make any decisions concerning President Kucan's 
visit to Zagreb for the time being. Whether the government will 
propose that President Kucan visit Zagreb or not will be decided 
by Prime Minister Drnovsek upon receipt of information on the 
Croatian Government stance on the Slovene proposal concerning 
the Secovlje border crossing and Piran Bay. [end recording]

  [Text] Ljubljana is hosting Austrian President Thomas 
Klestil who has arrived for a two-day official visit at the 
invitation of Slovene President Milan Kucan. Branko Maksimovic 
reports about the first round of talks with the top officials of 
our state: 
  [Begin recording] [Maksimovic] The great interest shown in 
Slovenia for the Austrian referendum on EU membership shows that 
this is also important for Slovenia, which will, in the case of 
a positive outcome, draw closer to Europe, too. This was the 
idea that Dr. Klestil emphasized at the first meeting with the 
reporters after one hour talks with President Kucan and after 
the meeting of both delegations, which also comprised Carinthian 
Governor Christoph Zernatto and Styrian Governor Josef Krainer, 
and Defense Ministers Fasslabend and Kacin. In his statement, 
President Milan Kucan rounded up the contents of the talks so 
far as follows: 
  [Kucan] The visit of President Dr. Klestil is the first 
official visit of an Austrian president to the independent 
Slovenia, a confirmation and a reflection of good relations with 
a long tradition, and affirmation of the trust that was formed 
during the process of Slovenia gaining its independence -- 
during the war for our independence and efforts for our 
international recognition. I view this visit as a part of 
intensified cooperation between the countries and the presidents 
of Central Europe, which is helping to strengthen the awareness 
about spiritual, cultural, and the civilization belonging to 
this region that is gaining importance in the new Europe because 
it is bringing its values to it. This visit also allows, in 
accordance with the tradition of good relations and the achieved 
mutual trust, the solution of some issues that have been 
accompanying our relations for many years. At this moment, this 
does not merely involve the questions connected with the 
expatriates' bureau [zdomska centrala] and the issue of economic 
cooperation and the deficit that Slovenia currently has in these 
relations, but also several concrete proposals of which 
President Klestil will speak with Prime Minister Drnovsek. I 
would like to emphasize here that we could not have avoided the 
problem of rights and the protection of the Slovene minority in 
Austria in these talks. In connection with this, we also 
discussed the fate of the Austrian State Treaty. 
  [Maksimovic] Let me add that, at the above-mentioned meeting 
with Slovene Prime Minister Dr. Drnovsek, the Austrian guest 
handed him a comprehensive memorandum containing concrete plans 
for economic cooperation. A charter on Austrian assistance in 
the education of the refugee children in Slovenia was signed at 
noon in the presence of both presidents. From the remaining 
program of today's visit, let me single out that President 
Klestil will, in approximately an hour, speak in the Slovene 
Parliament and at 1800 open the House of the Carinthian Slovenes 
together with President Kucan. [end recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, 2 Jun -- The charge d'affaires of the 
German embassy in Belgrade was summoned to the Federal Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs today. The reason was to deliver to him a 
sharp protest in connection with the stances contained in the 31 
May statement by the German Foreign Ministry concerning talks 
between the German State Minister Helmut Schaefer and Ibrahim 
Rugova, who was presented as "the most senior freely elected 
representative of the majority Albanian population in Kosovo." 
  The statement of the German Foreign Ministry contains "false 
information and an unacceptable assessment of Serbian policy in 
Kosovo-Metohija, and sets out the positive assessments of the 
German Government on Rugova's separatist movement," the demarche 
notes. 
  The Yugoslav protest stressed that the stances contained in 
the German Foreign Ministry statement "support in the most 
direct way the separatism of the leader of the Albanian national 
minority and are an impermissible interference in the internal 
affairs of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]." These 
stances are in contravention of the principles of the UN charter 
and the Final Act of the CSCE, the statement noted.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija 
Izetbegovic had talks today with a delegation of the U.S. 
Congress made up of senators Robert Dole, Joseph Biden, and John 
Warner. 
  Izetbegovic spoke about the problem of lifting the arms 
embargo imposed on the legitimate Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. 
Being aware of the fact that it is really unlikely to expect 
the embargo to be lifted, Izetbegovic proposed to the U.S. 
senators that, instead of supplying the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government with arms, the Serb heavy weapons should be seized; 
this would represent the implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 752. 
  Senator Dole stressed that the condition for the United 
States to send its troops to Bosnia is attainment of a 
comprehensive peace solution. Dole also said that a fair peace 
in Bosnia must be restored, and therefore in his mind it is 
wrong to speak about the percentages of territory as the primary 
issue rather than about the principles of that peace. 
  The U.S. senators brought to Sarajevo 750 kg of clothes, 
3,000 pairs of children's shoes, and a larger quantity of toys, 
books, and medicines. The U.S. delegation has left Sarajevo for 
Normandy where it is to take part in the D-Day celebrations.

  [Excerpt] Again no favorable news from Gorazde: As of this 
morning no withdrawal by the chetniks from their positions in 
the three-kilometer exclusion zone have taken place. On the 
right bank of the Drina River they are just a few hundred meters 
from the town, while on the left bank they are still within 2.5 
kilometers of the center of town. 
  The quibbling over whether these are soldiers, police, or 
armed civilians is more than pointless. When all is said and 
done uniforms have never killed anyone in this war. [passage

<F P=106> [Article by U.K., S.A.: "Will Promotion Help? Efforts to </F>
Enter Difficult Japanese Market"] 
  [Text] The meeting of both countries' economic 
committees demonstrated that, in many areas, cooperation is 
developing dynamically, while the Japanese Government's decision 
to unblock the granting of guarantees for merchandise contracts 
and investment activity in the Polish market may particularly 
enliven the cooperation, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak 
after a meeting with Toshikuni Yahiro, chairman of the 
Japanese-Polish Committee. 
  Polish firms have a chance to enter the Japanese market 
provided their products are qualitatively perfect and meet any 
standards observed in Japan, and that they know how to win the 
confidence of Japanese customers. How this should be 
accomplished was the subject of the second day of debates at the 
15th Session of Polish and Japanese Economic Committees. 
  The Japanese stressed that, in the new reality, Poland could 
occupy a central position in the region, being placed between 
Russia and countries of the European Union. But the Poles 
should learn to promote their merchandise because export 
capabilities and product competitiveness are a guarantee of 
commercial success in the international market. Marketing 
success depends on product quality--the Japanese have 
particularly high standards in that regard--and on price, 
distribution, and promotion, said Hideo Kimura of Sophia 
University. 
  The Japanese will help us with the promotion part. Hajime 
Yoshioka, director of the Tokyo International Fair, officially 
invited Polish firms to participate in the 1995 fair. Within a 
program of acceleration of economic reforms and development of 
the countries of Central and East Europe, we can also count on 
help in organizing the firms' stay in Tokyo and on product 
promotion provided by the JETRO Japanese Foreign Trade Agency. 
  Speaking about the sources of Japanese success, Hideo Kimura 
stressed the role of state interventionism and of management and 
collective decisionmaking. He emphasized that state policy and 
a specific strategy, as defined by multiyear plans, were being 
consistently implemented. 
  The role of corporations and holdings in the economy is also 
worth emphasizing. Only such strong 
industrial/commercial/financial organizations are currently 
capable of meeting the requirements of international markets. 
  But, due primarily to a big cultural difference, not all 
Japanese experiences can be directly implemented in Poland. 
Japan is a large and perfectionist market, while Polish 
products are often far from meeting the quality standards in 
effect in Japan, Wladyslaw Szczepankowski, chairman of the 
Agropol company, told NOWA EUROPA. But my company has been 
active in the Japanese market, and we score quite decent 
results--$80 million in mutual exchange. We sell mostly grocery 
products but also crystal and furniture. But it is hard to 
speak of promotion or marketing because that requires very high 
expenditures, which Polish producers simply cannot afford.

  [Text] Geneva, June 6 (TANJUG) -- U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, who arrived in Geneva late on Sunday, early 
on Monday conferred with his special envoy to former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi and Co-Chairman of the Conference on the Former 
Yugoslavia Thorvald Stoltenberg, it was said in the U.N. 
headquarters in Geneva. Akashi gave Butrus-Ghali a detailed 
account of the efforts made over the past four days in order to 
enable the beginning of a conference on a comprehensive 
cessation of hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, said a spokesman 
at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva. 
  Butrus-Ghali was pleased with the fact that Akashi's efforts 
were fruitful and expressed hope that this would pave the way to 
a comprehensive political settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Speaking on behalf of the mediators and the two negotiating 
sides (the Bosnian Serb republic and the Moslem-Croat 
federation), the spokesman has officially confirmed that the 
talks began at 11.15 A.M. (0915 GMT) on Monday with a meeting 
between Akashi and Vice- President of the Moslem-Croat 
Federation Ejup Ganic. 
  Butrus-Ghali especially thanked Akashi for providing a 
platform for the beginning of the talks and promised to give him 
his full support in the forthcoming negotiating process.

  [Text] Geneva, 6 Jun (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic president 
Radovan Karadzic has said that he is ready to sign a document on 
a permanent cessation of hostilities throughout the territory of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic 
stressed that the Serb side is in favor of a permanent, not 
limited, cessation of all forms of hostilities. 
  Early this morning, at a meeting between Yasushi Akashi, the 
UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and Muslim Vice 
President Ejup Ganic [title as received], the Muslim-Croat side 
insisted that it would accept only two months of a cessation of 
hostilities at the most. The Muslims and Croats believe that in 
that period an agreement on the basis of the contact group's 
proposal for the territorial division of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be reached. 
  Ganic told Akashi that "the Muslim-Croat side does not, 
under 
any circumstances, want the Geneva conference to freeze the 
current situation in former Bosnia-Herzegovina."

  [Text] The Serbs have withdrawn from their positions around 
Gorazde, thus breaking the stalemate in the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
cease-fire negotiations in Geneva. A Croat-Bosniak delegation 
presented its views on the cease-fire conditions, and Federation 
President Kresimir Zubak commented on the UN proposals. 
Croatian TV journalist Jozo Curic has a report from Geneva: 
  [Begin recording] [Curic] Can you explain in brief which 
parts of the UN proposals are unacceptable to the Federation and 
what the essence of the Federation's new proposal is? 
  [Zubak] We do not consider acceptable the parts of the 
proposal offered to us setting out that the cease-fire ought to 
last for four months, with the separation of forces 2 km from 
each side of the current front line, and the withdrawal of heavy 
weapons, over 12.7-mm, to a distance of 20 km from the current 
front lines. We do not consider good the proposal that the UN 
Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] should be deployed between us. We 
believe, on the basis of Croatia's experience, that this may 
freeze the present situation for a longer period of time, and if 
a political solution is not reached, then this solution would be 
a preparation for some other political solutions. 
  [Curic] What is the essence of the new proposal put forward 
by the Federation? 
  [Zubak] We are proposing that this cease-fire period should 
be for four to six weeks, and that intensive political talks in 
that period leading to a comprehensive resolution of the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a political agreement, should continue. 
We have likewise proposed that heavy weapons should not be 
withdrawn 20 km from the front lines, but should be collected at 
several points, just as in Sarajevo, and that UNPROFOR control 
over these weapons should be secured. We also consider that 
personnel should not be withdrawn 2 km from the current 
frontlines, and think that UNPROFOR should not be deployed 
between us; instead, UNPROFOR should be behind our backs and 
behind our enemies, monitoring from there whether we are 
observing the cease-fire agreement and to what extent. [end

  [Text] The cabinet of our country's president of the 
Presidency has released a statement explaining the position of 
the Federation and Republic state delegation at the negotiations. 
  The delegation demands that the cease-fire throughout the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina should be for a period of four 
weeks. Arms of 12.7-mm caliber and upwards must be concentrated 
far from the front lines, and have to be guarded and monitored 
by the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and NATO. The monitoring 
of the cease-fire and communication between the opponents would 
be secured by UNPROFOR according to the procedure coordinated 
with the legitimate authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation also insists on guarantees 
for the unimpaired passage of humanitarian organizations 
throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, the immediate release of all 
civilians held by the aggressor side, the unconditional and 
immediate opening of Tuzla airport for the delivery of goods for 
civilian purposes, the cessation of ethnic cleansing, and the 
effective implementation of all Security Council resolutions 
regarding the protection of security zones. 
  The negotiations in Geneva are not being conducted directly 
with the representatives of the aggressor, but according to the 
principle of separate rooms. UN representatives are acting as 
mediators for the proposals of the parties involved, reads the 
statement from the cabinet of the president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, June 7 (AFP) -- UN special envoy 
Yasushi Akashi said Tuesday that he would insist that Bosnia's 
warring parties accept a four-month countrywide ceasefire at 
peace talks that entered their second day here. Akashi, asked 
if he would be prepared to reduce the duration of the ceasefire 
as demanded by the Moslem-led Bosnian government and their Croat 
allies, answered firmly: "No, I am not." But, he added "our 
negotiation with both parties separately is proceeding 
exceedingly well. The atmosphere is businesslike, frank and 
friendly." 
  The duration of the ceasefire is one of the principle 
sticking-points in the ceasefire talks which began here Monday 
between Bosnia's Croats, Moslems and Serbs, UN diplomats said. 
[passage omitted] 
  Akashi said that although the ceasefire talks were "separate 
from a political settlement ... of course the two agreements 
have to be closely linked." Akashi said there were still "a few 
difficult questions which have to be resolved." But, he added 
"we will make every effort possible to anchor the agreement by 
tonight." [passage omitted] 
  Akashi was due to meet the Serb delegation led by Radovan 
Karadzic Tuesday morning for an hour before joining a meeting 
between UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the joint 
heads of the Bosnian delegation, Kresimir Zubak and Ejup Ganic, 
around 11:30 a.m. (0930 GMT). "Then we will see the Bosnian 
side and the Serb side and we will repeat this throughout the 
day," Akashi said. 
  The UN envoy said he did not envisage the Bosnian and 
Bosnian 
Serb delegations would sit at the same negotiating table except 
"for the signature" of an agreement.

  [Text] The discussion on the new charter of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP] has been going on for six hours now. 
Thus, the forecast of many delegates -- that the basic party 
document would be adopted without any problems -- has been 
proven wrong. According to our correspondents at the congress, 
the delegates have only adopted only one-third of the charter's 
articles so far. However, according to circles in the BSP 
Supreme Council, the basic work is still to come because the 
disputed articles related to the BSP Supreme Council's rights 
and prerogatives, its relations with the parliamentary factions, 
and the elections of the DUMA chief editor have not yet been 
discussed. 
  Our correspondents have predicted that because of the 
prolonged discussion on the charter, the 41st BSP Congress will 
begin the procedure to elect the new BSP leading organs and 
party leader late tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning. 
Different names of possible candidates for the post of party 
leader are mentioned in the corridors -- among them Zhan 
Videnov, Aleksandur Marinov, Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, and 
Georgi Pirinski.

<F P=106> [Report by Silviya Velikova from the 41st Congress of the </F>
Bulgarian Socialist Party in Sofia -- live] 
  [Text] Good morning from the National Palace of Culture. 
A little before midnight, after devoting almost three times 
longer than expected to the debate on the draft charter of the 
BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party], the delegates succeeded in 
adopting the new charter. Having concluded the debates on the 
section of the new charter that prescribes the procedure for 
electing the BSP Supreme Council, the All-Party Control-Auditing 
Commission, and the chairman of the Supreme Council, the 
delegates started discussing the candidates for posts in the 
supreme BSP organs. The voting went on for almost three hours. 
After the results are announced, the congress will go into 
another closed session to discuss the candidatures for the 
chairmanship of the Supreme Council. According to unofficial 
information, along with the present leader Zhan Videnov, Georgi 
Pirinski and Aleksandur Marinov are also in the contest. 
  The delegates also have to vote on the political resolution 
of the 41st BSP Congress. The main point in the resolution is 
that the Socialists call for early parliamentary elections in 
the fall of 1994. According to the resolution, power in the 
country can be stabilized only through new national elections. 
The congress continues.

  [Text] Zhan Videnov has been reelected chairman of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Supreme Council. According to 
the Election Commission, 688 delegates voted. Some 640 
supported Videnov. The delegates in the congress hall greeted 
this report with applause. Some 47 delegates voted against 
Videnov and one abstained. The results of the All-Party Control 
Commission election are expected in about 30 minutes. 
  Four prominent socialist deputies of the Alliance for Social 
Democracy failed to gain the minimum required votes -- 50 
percent plus one vote -- which is a condition for entering the 
BSP Supreme Council. Dimitur Yonchev, Velislava Dureva, Rosen 
Karadimov, and Elena Poptomova were not elected by the delegates 
who voted for the supreme party organ membership. Andrey 
Lukanov also failed in the election for membership in the BSP 
Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Svetlana Belousova: "Bulgarian Socialist Party </F>
Initiates Petition To Topple Berov"] 
  [Text] At the first sign of deterioration in the social 
situation in the country, Yuri Borisov will initiate a petition 
among the deputies of the Parliamentary Union for Social 
Democracy [PSSD] with the demand to propose a vote of 
no-confidence in Lyuben Berov's cabinet. The deputy informed 
journalists of his intention during the 29 May plenum of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. 
  At their two-day national meeting in Karlovo the members of 
the Socialist Youth Union [SMS] decided that their organization 
should leave the PSSD if a petition aimed at prompting a 
no-confidence vote is not immediately initiated, SMS leader 
Lyubomir Nikolov announced on 29 May. 
  The upcoming 41st BSP Congress should direct the party's 
activity toward holding early elections, while the PSSD should 
facilitate the adoption of the necessary laws by the end of the 
summer vacation, BSP leader Zhan Videnov insisted in the draft 
resolution he proposed at the plenum. Videnov also proposed to 
the PSSD deputies to reject changes in the cabinet which lead 
toward asserting a party character in this organ. In yet 
another proposal he suggested to the PSSD to deny support to the 
governmental program until September 1994, and seek 
possibilities of initiating joint activities with the trade 
unions vis-a-vis the cabinet and the social commitments it 
assumed. 
  In his statement he clearly implied that in anything related 
to amendments in the Constitution and the Election Law 
negotiations must be conducted only with the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS]. 
  At the plenum Ananieva explained the situation related to 
the 
confidence vote, requested by the prime minister on 26 May. 
According to Ananieva, Aleksandur Tomov [leader of the Civic 
Alliance for the Republic] was trying to organize the support of 
30 PSSD deputies for the idea of forming a pro-president 
government. The alternative of forming a caretaker cabinet had 
also been discussed, Ananieva said. 
  The young Socialist proposed a draft resolution calling on 
the PSSD deputies to carry out a vote of no-confidence in their 
chairman, but according to Videnov the proposal was not made in 
accordance to the correct procedure and was not discussed at the 
plenum because of its unserious character.

Dogan, leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], and 
expressed his intention to submit a proposal on personnel 
changes in the cabinet at the 8 and 9 June National Assembly

Minister Berov does not plan any structural changes in the 
Council of Ministers or new candidacies for the post of deputy

<F P=106> [Report by Galya Nikolova: "Discontented DPS Members Form </F>
New Party] 
  [Text] Former deputies of the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms [DPS] who left the parliamentary factions of the DPS 
and approximately 150 supporters established the Party of 
Democratic Changes over the weekend of 28-29 May. Mehmed Hodja 
was elected chairman, and National Assembly member Ismail Ismail 
and Sabri Hyusein, lawyer from Plovdiv, were elected deputy 
chairmen. 
  Statements made at the meeting voiced dissatisfaction with 
the DPS and its leaders. The new formation will seek an 
alliance with all non-communist forces and will reject any 
cooperation with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. The new 
party categorically dissociates itself from the manifestations 
of nationalism and separatism, reads the program that was 
adopted. The charter stresses that any member disseminating 
nationalist ideas will be ousted from the party. The new party 
will struggle against the practice according to which minority 
members only become members of parties formed on an ethnic 
foundation. The party considers itself to be on the right side 
of the political spectrum and supports the mixed election 
system. The first national forum will take place by the end of 
the year. Informed sources think that several local DPS 
branches will participate. 
  [DPS spokesman] Yunal Lyutfi described the new party as a 
new 
attempt to split the DPS and predicted that it will have the 
same fate as Adem Kenan's organization.

<F P=106> [Article by Krasimir Uzunov of the Balkan Agency: "Balkans </F>
Are Not Persian Gulf"] 
  [Text] The strong U.S. military presence in the Balkans 
during the last two years and the unconcealed and increasing 
appetites of the United States in the peninsula are well on the 
way to causing a huge row, which will certainly not be the last. 
  Albania's decision to hand over the Gjader air base in the 
vicinity of Tirana for the siting of radio monitoring equipment 
and the use of U.S. pilotless surveillance aircraft with an 
800-km range are two links in a chain that now has to be 
explained to the overtrustful Balkan peoples. In itself, the 
ASSOCIATED PRESS's disclosure of the U.S. spy plane flights over 
the Balkans would be merely worrying, if other facts were not 
notable by their absence. The readiness of the Albanian 
authorities to hand over air bases for combat aircraft in the 
event it becomes necessary to bomb Serbian positions, doubts 
about the building of a military base for the U.S. land forces 
in what was formerly the most up-to-date testing grounds for the 
Yugoslav People's Army at Krivolak in central Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the additions 
to the U.S. "blue helmet" contingent, the gradual replacement of 
Scandinavian troops with U.S. troops,... all these are only some 
of the steps being made to step up the military activities of 
the United States in the southern part of the Balkans, now that 
it is free of Russian influence. 
  Although the forces and hardware that have been 
concentrated, 
in the classical sense, in this region have their attention 
directed mainly toward the events in former Yugoslavia, our 
criminal insouciance as immediate neighbors may, at a certain 
stage of development, at the very least turn out to be a bad 
thing for us. 
  Judge for yourselves. The Democratic Party of [Albanian] 
President Sali Berisha and Eduard Selami, which sits firmly in 
the saddle in Tirana, chose the U.S. military presence as a 
means of settling accounts with Serbia in their dispute over 
Kosovo. On the other hand, Tirana managed to provide solid 
financial backing for itself by getting Albania, a country with 
a varied religious composition, accepted into the Islamic 
Conference Organization. 
  What is worse is that the troops who have come to monitor 
the 
Serbian border are casting their eyes more frequently toward the 
border with Bulgaria. One also notes that the military hardware 
that is transiting Bulgaria is suspiciously heavy-weight in 
nature, and that the white plane that infringed our airspace (in 
the region of Gyueshevo) last week was certainly not a 
Macedonian one, and was even less likely to be Serbian or Greek. 
  You may say, what then? With our knowledge and consent or 
not, the strata in the Balkans have begun to move and the 
"hunting reserves" are beginning to change hands. In other 
words, the United States is now a state with a firm footing in 
the straits, at the surviving Greek bases, in Albania, and in 
the newly restored Republic of Macedonia. The concluding stage 
of the realization of this great goal is associated with 
numerous moves of the most varied kind: Montgomery's readiness 
to amend our Constitution at a certain juncture; the U.S. 
patronage of the illegal Ilinden United Macedonian Organization 
and of Kamen Burov's Pomak Democratic Party; its interest in 
so-called artificial minorities; the location of the American 
University nowhere else than in Blagoevgrad; the articles about 
Bulgaria's territorial claims on Macedonia that have been 
appearing with surprising consistency; and the formation of a 
pro- American lobby among our politicians, who, to further their 
own careers, are ready to turn their backs on and betray their 
own country's national interests. 
  In the context of all this open and surreptitious activity, 
AP's allegedly sensational revelations of U.S. spy plane flights 
over the Balkans only mark the beginning of something far more 
serious that might shake the states established in our 
eruption-prone peninsula. If those of our statesmen that still 
nurture pro-American feelings have not yet realized our 
geostrategic situation, I advise them to spend an hour or two 
perusing the map. The Balkans are not yet the [Persian] Gulf, 
although some people are very keen on them becoming so. One 
thing, we have no oil, and another, not all of us are yet 
inclined to become Muslims.

<F P=106> [Interview with Oleg Lobov, secretary of the Russian </F>
Federation Security Council, by Georgi Aleksandrov; place and 
date not given: "In the Defense Industry It Is Illogical for 
Each of Us To Invent the Bicycle Separately...."] 
  [Text] [Aleksandrov] Mr. Lobov, what were the dominant 
issues in your talks with President Zhelyu Zhelev? 
  [Lobov] Most stress was placed on the joint documents we 
have signed that create a Bulgarian-Russian Intergovernmental 
Commission on Defense Industry Cooperation, the protocol on 
cooperation in military equipment, and the problem of the new 
transport link between Bulgaria and Russia. I gave Dr. Zhelev 
an oral message from the Russian president that confirms all the 
accords that the two leaders reached in 1992 during your 
president's visit to Russia. In his message, Boris Nikolayevich 
drew attention to the fact that, despite the well-known 
difficulties in our bilateral economic relations arising from 
the transition to a market economy, our mutual trade increased 
by 20 percent in 1993. Because our transportation and 
communications system had deteriorated and been interrupted, 
which you know about (we now have to pass through eight borders 
and customs posts between Sofia and Russia), the president and I 
discussed our proposal to find an overall solution for this 
problem by restoring the direct sea link between Varna and 
Novorossiysk. Dr. Zhelev showed great interest in the 
completion of this project. 
  [Aleksandrov] What problems did you discuss regarding 
regional security? What are the prospects for expanding (not 
only on paper) our mutually beneficial cooperation in military 
production? 
  [Lobov] Yes, our visit is mainly in connection with security 
and cooperation issues in the field of military defense 
production. Bulgaria created its army on the basis of Russian 
weapons and arms produced in its own military plants, mainly 
under licenses granted by Russian enterprises. Of course, your 
country has weapons even now that it produces itself, because it 
has its own specialists, engineers, and designers. However, Dr. 
Zhelev and I agreed that this cooperation in the military 
industry field can be continued and further developed on a 
mutually beneficial basis, insofar as our economic, financial, 
and human resources permit. You yourself realize that it is 
illogical for each of us to separately invest immense funds "to 
reinvent the bicycle" when it, or at least parts of it, already 
exists both in Bulgaria and in Russia. Accordingly, in view of 
this fact we should think about how to draw mutual benefit from 
it. There is no disagreement between us on this, that is, in 
the defense industry we can successfully develop mutual 
cooperation, and I hope to investigate the conditions for this 
during our visit to Bulgaria. 
  [Aleksandrov] Mr. Lobov, what concerns you in the Black Sea 
region? Bulgaria has signed the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, but Russia has yet to sign it.... 
  [Lobov] The problem is that the geopolitical situation has 
changed in the Black Sea region and the Balkans. We have to 
take these realities into account and consider them carefully, 
because we must maintain Russia's defense at a dependable level. 
This is why we want the Black Sea basin to remain a zone of 
peace, not a region for developing conflicts, and I believe that 
not only we Russians but also you people in Bulgaria have an 
interest in this!

  [Text] A protest rally was organized this morning by the 
Association of Romanian Revolutionaries in Bucharest's 
Revolution Square, in front of the headquarters of Romania's 
Senate. The protesters demanded the withdrawal of parliamentary 
immunity and the start of legal proceedings against Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor [president of the Greater Romania Party, PRM], 
Adrian Paunescu [vice president of the Socialist Party of Labor, 
PSM], and Valeriu Momanu [senator of the Social Democracy Party 
of Romania, PDSR], for, quote, their attitude and slanderous 
statements about the December 1989 revolution, the martyred 
heroes, and the revolutionaries, end quote. 
  The participants in the rally chanted slogans against the 
PRM 
and the PSM and against the reestablishment of the Romanian 
Communist Party [PCR], which they consider to be a slap in the 
face of the revolution and its heroes. 
  A communique from the National Confederation of Free Unions 
in Romania [CNSRL]-Fratia, signed by Executive Chairman Miron 
Mitrea, was read at the meeting. The communique expressed that 
confederation's support for the demands of the revolutionaries. 
  Throughout the duration of the rally, a group of PRM 
supporters was also present in Revolution Square. Small 
scuffles broke out between them and the representatives of the 
revolutionaries. The police troops present in the square 
intervened promptly and restored order.

  [Text] The Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] has faxed 
us a communique referring to the assertion made in Constanta [on 
3 June] by Corneliu Vadim Tudor [senator and chairman of the 
Greater Romania Party, PRM], during a news conference organized 
in that city by the PRM. According to the communique, the SRI 
press bureau has been authorized to publish the following: 
  The examination of the operational situation and the 
information available in the reference domain does not confirm 
the existence of any intention or real possibility of 
assassinating the Romanian president or restoring the monarchy 
in the near future. 
  The circulation of such news without the sufficient previous 
checking of its likelihood needlessly creates confusion and 
unrest or, on the contrary, it makes public opinion doubt the 
seriousness of such assertions. The SRI communique concludes by 
saying that, quote, however, if Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor is 
in possession of realistic information with respect to the 
aforementioned issue, we invite him to publish it, unquote.

<F P=106> [Report by Dan Andronic: "On His South American Tour </F>
Nicolae Vacaroiu Was Accompanied by the Representative of a 
Company Involved in Radioactive Materials Trafficking"] 
  [Text] After having published our article titled "Romanian 
Companies Trade With Radioactive Material and Armaments From the 
Soviet Union," now we can let you know that we are in possession 
of information proving that one of the members of the government 
delegation headed by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, which 
visited a number of Latin American countries, was the 
representative of such a company. 
  Thus, in Chapter 5 of the official list of the delegation, 
which contains the names of the businessmen accompanying the 
prime minister, one finds the name of Constantin Francu, 
director of the board of the Dunarea Ltd. company. 
  We consider it strange that the same person, Constantin 
Francu, was once caught at the Varsand border crossing point, in 
Arad County, trying to take over 10 kg of red mercury. It is 
noteworthy that this was the largest red mercury seizure ever 
made on the territory of Romania and that the place of origin 
was the former Soviet Union.

<F P=106> [Report by Andra Aurora Manta and Marcela Feraru: </F>
"Alexandru Oproiu, State Secretary of the Health Ministry, 
Falsified the Cirrhosis Diagnosis of Nicu Ceausescu"] 
  [Text] "The population of Sibiu feels pity and sympathy 
for Nicu Ceausescu, although according to the findings of the 
commission [investigating the 1989 December events], he was the 
one who called the terrorists to come to that town," Serban 
Sandulescu, senator for the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian 
Democratic Party] and a member of the commission investigating 
the 1989 December events, asserted during a news conference 
yesterday. 
  The cirrhosis diagnosis, on the basis of which Nicu 
Ceausescu 
today walks around as a free person, was established on the 
basis of an endoscopic examination that actually did not take 
place at all. Nicu Ceausescu was "submitted" to that examination 
by Alexandru Oproiu, state secretary of the Ministry of Health. 
According to the conclusions of Senator Sandulescu, Oproiu 
"deliberately falsified the diagnosis." 
  The PNTCD senator also said that he is in possession of a 
copy of the medical records on the son of the former dictator 
and that one of the physicians who had been in charge of tending 
to Nicu Ceausescu in the Colentina Hospital confirmed that the 
latter's cirrhosis "is merely a bedtime story for children." 
  Senator Sandulescu also stated that the bodies authorized to 
investigate the 1989 December events "did everything possible to 
conceal the truth and remove the traces." "Despite the fact 
that all the persons who were summoned to bear witness in front 
of the senators' commission swore to tell the truth, they 
actually lied," asserted Sandulescu.

  [Text] In talks today delegations from the Romanian and 
French Defense Ministries reviewed the current stage in 
bilateral relations and their perspectives and assessed the 
current situation in Europe and the tendencies of security 
structures at the continental level. 
  Romanian National Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told us 
that he had asked French Minister Leotard to urge the important 
French companies to come to Romania to cooperate both in the 
field of military equipment and in the civilian economy. 
  Similarly they assessed cooperation between Romania and 
France, as well as between the two armed forces, within the 
framework of NATO, in the context of the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, and within the Western European Union [WEU], where 
they noted Romania's status as an associate partner within that 
organization, a status granted to central European countries. 
  The talks also focused on the perspectives of strengthening 
European stability, the readiness of the two parties to 
cooperate in that domain, and the possibilities opened by the 
stability pact initiated by French Prime Minister Edouard 
Balladur. 
  The talks held this afternoon by the Romanian and French 
defense delegations proved to be a good opportunity to reconfirm 
the friendly relations between Romania and France and the two 
armed forces and the mutual desire to further those relations, 
in view of the need for cooperation to find the most favorable 
solutions to remodel the security context and common future of 
united Europe.

  [Text] Francois Leotard, French minister of state for 
defense, expressed his satisfaction with the political and 
military dialogue he had in Bucharest and termed those talks as 
very positive, report our correspondents Doina Saiciuc and Nicu 
Popescu, who attended the news conference organized this morning 
at the residence of France's ambassador to Bucharest. During 
the talks, the French defense minister said, they examined the 
problems of Europe's security architecture, regional security, 
and military cooperation. Leotard termed as very close the two 
parties' assessments of the Partnership for Peace initiative and 
the stability pact, which was initiated by French Prime Minister 
Edouard Balladur. 
  Leotard announced that he had proposed to the Romanian party 
that the French and Romanian navies should hold joint drills and 
that he had invited the Romanian minister of national defense to 
visit Paris. 
  Gheorghe Tinca, who also attended the news conference, said 
that he had accepted Leotard's invitation with pleasure and that 
his visit is to take place in the month of September, after 
which he emphasized that the Bucharest talks were the logical 
continuation of the talks held by the presidents of Romania and 
France, Ion Iliescu and Francois Mitterrand. 
  Tinca also noted the similar evaluations made by the two 
parties in the domains of regional and European security, as 
well as the readiness of the French party to cooperate with our 
country. 
  This morning Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu also 
held talks with Francois Leotard. According to our reporter, 
their talks focused on the principal geopolitical trends, with a 
special emphasis on the military angle. Besides recent 
evolutions in former Yugoslavia, Russia, and Ukraine, they also 
touched on the subject of the Partnership for Peace and the 
Balladur pact for stability in Europe. The French minister was 
also received at Cotroceni Palace.

  [Text] In the spirit of the agreement between the liberal 
parties, the leaders of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] 
have informed the leaders of the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] that in the coming days they will begin coalition 
discussions with the Socialists. All the signs indicate that 
this is the last act of the liberal parties' cooperation 
concluded before the elections. Laszlo Kover [head of the 
Fidesz parliamentary group] is at the microphone with Dora 
Adorjan: 
  [Begin Kover recording] [Fidesz Presidium member] Janos Ader 
and I received Gabor Kuncze [head of the SZDSZ parliamentary 
group] and [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto, who, in the terms of the 
agreement with the SZDSZ, informed us that they have received a 
request from the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] to take part 
in the coalition discussions and that, as is known, they were 
given the mandate for this by the delegates' assembly. 
  Apart from this, they inquired what would be Fidesz's 
possible reaction to a coalition invitation. To this we were 
able to reply by saying what we have already said, namely that 
we cannot reply to a nonexistent invitation. If an official 
request arrives from the MSZP, then the national board will 
satisfy the duties that devolve upon it from the statutes. It 
will discuss a possible invitation and decide on it. 
  If the SZDSZ raises this issue at the talks with the MSZP -- 
incidentally, although it has the right to do this, it can only 
do so on its own behalf -- we have asked them that in any event 
they should do it in such a way that it should be clear that it 
is their opinion and that they are not conveying some kind of 
message. [end recording]

  [Text] At the coalition negotiations which started today, 
the leaders of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats decided to set up 10 expert 
committees, Gyula Horn has told journalists. The MSZP chairman 
also said that the two parties want to draw up a coalition 
agreement to serve as the basis for a joint government by 24 
June. As a matter of fact, today's round of coordination talks 
was of a technical nature. The participants drew up a timetable 
for the next talks. On behalf of the MSZP, Imre Szekeres and 
Ferenc Baja are expected to head the committee dealing with the 
government's structure, and Gyorgy Janosi is expected to head 
the working group on the state of the media, our correspondent 
reports from the scene of the talks.

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Bekesi, economic expert of the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, by Pal Emod; place and date not 
given: "The Country's Foreign Solvency Might Become Endangered 
in 1995"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Emod] Would the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] be able to implement its programs on its 
own? 
  [Bekesi] Even if we assume that the MSZP will adhere to its 
program -- which in itself is brave, but I hope that this is 
what people voted for -- it is very dangerous to launch it on 
its own. It is true that we have a mathematical parliamentary 
majority, but the MSZP will have to keep this 54 percent, 
otherwise the one-party government will fail. Out of the 209 
deputies, 149 won in individual districts and it is their moral 
obligation to firmly assert the interests of their own district 
already at the beginning of the cycle. Therefore, they will 
make serious demands on distribution: area development and 
infrastructural demands, the need to support unviable 
enterprises, and so on. However, we do not have the resources 
for this at the moment, and will not have them in 1995, either. 
  [Emod] Can the trade unions also make similar demands? 
  [Bekesi] Obviously. In addition to this, a social pact will 
have to be drawn up. If the MSZP governs on its own then it 
will have to yield to the powerful trade union demands, whether 
it likes it or not, which will obviously lead to 
overdistribution. Therefore, it is possible that the MSZP will 
deviate from the program's line to preserve the majority -- in 
the wake of unavoidable, well-meant compromises. This can 
result in the country's ability to meet its foreign payment 
obligations becoming endangered by the end of 1995. 
  [Emod] Is it because this danger can only be avoided with a 
coalition that you will not accept a ministerial post in a 
one-party government? 
  [Bekesi] It is. In my view, the coalition is not simply a 
parliamentary requirement because there is no such thing. It is 
not a political exigency, either, because this does not exist 
either. The coalition is a strategic necessity for the MSZP, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the country, too. This 
is the reason I am saying that I do not see a guarantee for the 
program that I drew up to be implemented without a coalition. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Emod] The most serious dilemma has not been solved because 
the structure of state spending has hardly changed. Do you 
agree with this? 
  [Bekesi] Yes, nothing much has happened. The basis is the 
same; the budget is financing the same institutional system and 
tasks as in 1990. [passage omitted] 
  [Emod] If this is so then the question seems superfluous: 
Can the reform of state finances be delayed any longer? 
  [Bekesi] Not a minute, if we assess the consequences; later 
we can also look at the causes. The planned consolidated 
deficit of the state finances will be 330 billion forints. 
[passage omitted] As the population's savings will not be more 
than 220-240 billion forints even in an optimal case, a 
100-billion-forint gap can already be seen. As for foreign 
financing, let us look at the current payment balance. Data of 
the first four months show a $1 billion deficit, so a $3-billion 
to $4-billion deficit can develop by the end of the year. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Emod] I believe you wish to continue with the debt 
servicing, which is extremely high.... 
  [Bekesi] More than $4 billion. In other words, $4 billion 
plus $3 billion in fresh money has to be brought into the 
country this year whether we like it or not. If we presume that 
we can sell some concession rights, that the privatization of 
medium-size enterprises is started, and that foreigners even buy 
from the share packages of some banks, then we can bring in $2 
billion at best. Therefore we still have $5 billion which is 
nearly impossible to be brought in from abroad. 
  [Emod] Do you still maintain this if we manage to make a new 
medium-term agreement with the IMF? 
  [Bekesi] This is what I wanted to continue with. The new 
government will obviously announce a serious stabilization and 
modernization program. This is only realistic in the case of a 
coalition government because this is what the two parties 
represent, therefore, it can be the basis of the joint 
government program. On this basis, we can complete an agreement 
on financing a medium-term modernization with the IMF. 
Naturally, this can only be successful if we can make the IMF 
accept our 1995 and our longer-term economic program. 
  [Emod] In an optimal case, how much can we borrow from 
abroad in 1994? 
  [Bekesi] If the above conditions are met then we have a 
realistic chance to borrow $2 billion to $3 billion in the rest 
of the year. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In Budapest and in Heves, Fejer, Gyor-Moson-Sopron 
and Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok counties, bids will be invited for the 
privatization of approximately 50 pharmacies by 6 May, as 
announced at the press briefing following the meeting of the 
State Property Agency [AVU] Board of Directors. 
  Bids will be invited soon for the privatization of the 
HungarHotels Corporation. HungarHotels is the only hotel chain 
the privatization of which has not yet begun, although several 
units were separated from the firm earlier. The make-up of the 
corporation will be further modified on the basis of the latest 
decision in February. Bids will be invited for 15 Hungarian and 
two German hotels, as well as for four Budapest hotels in the 
near future. The corporation currently has a capital of 9 
billion forints [Ft], from which a business share worth Ft1.5 
billion will be separated. The AVU is hoping for a professional 
investor who is also expected to underwrite a credit guarantee 
of Ft1.1 billion. HungarHotels used to underwrite this guarantee 
as the former owner of the Club Tihany Corporation. 
  The AVU wants to invite bids for Club Tihany after the 
future 
of HungarHotels has been decided. The resort at lake Balaton was 
built from a Ft1.2-billion Austrian loan, and though it is 
profitable, the repayment of the loan is too great a task for 
the firm. 
  A decision was made about the dividend policy of the firms 
belonging to the AVU. Although the budget expects a dividend 
payment of Ft4 billion, the AVU would only take as much from the 
firms as would not hamper the functioning of the corporations, 
and is even willing to pay the budget less than the projected 
amount. 
  The first one of the firms owned by the Employee Stock 
Ownership Program, Aranypok [Golden Spider] Corporation, will 
appear on the stock exchange. The AVU still has a 10-percent 
share in the corporation which they are offering one-to-one for 
compensation vouchers. The underwriting can take place between 9 
and 13 May.

  [Text] According to Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav 
Pittner, the law on place-name signs will have to be resubmitted 
to the Bratislava parliament. Ladislav Pittner warns that, as a 
result of the bill's defeat on 3 June, irrendentism could become 
stronger. 
  The Bratislava paper UJ SZO has written that the reason the 
bill on bilingual place-names failed was that, among the members 
of the Miklos Duray-led Coexistence Movement, one had voted 
against the bill and two abstained. Because of this, 
Coexistence made sure that Slovakia would not get closer to 
Europe and that the Hungarians and the Slovaks would further 
distance themselves from each other, the Bratislava paper writes.

<F P=106> [Article by "bog, mh": "Voting on Amendment to the Electoral </F>
Law Will Probably Take Place on Thursday"] 
  [Excerpts] Bratislava--Virtually the whole day of 
yesterday's continuation of the 32d meeting of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR] was taken up by the debate 
on the draft amendment to the electoral law, which was put 
forward by a group of deputies. Because of the large number of 
proposed changes and to give the deputies time to study them 
thoroughly, the vote on the amendment was postponed until 2 
June, according to NRSR Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. [passage 
omitted] 
  The proposal to amend the electoral law was put forward by 
Deputy P. Hrusovsky (Christian Democratic Movement). He 
proposed that the provision be deleted from the law under which 
the ballot papers are delivered to the voters' homes. According 
to the amendment, the ballot papers should be handed out at the 
polling station. The amendment also amends provisions on the 
active right to vote of citizens of the Slovak Republic living 
outside the territory of the Slovak Republic. Until now, only 
Slovak Republic citizens permanently residing in the Slovak 
Republic had the right to vote. Under the coalition's proposal, 
they are to retain the right to vote even if they are not 
permanently residing in the Slovak Republic. To exercise this 
right, however, they must come to the Slovak Republic to cast 
their vote. The amendment proposes, furthermore, an increase in 
the number of candidates on the political parties' slates of 
candidates for the NRSR from 40 to 50. The coalition's 
proposals were opposed by deputies from the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS]. 
[passage omitted] Jan Carnogursky proposed that campaign 
broadcasts be permitted on private radio or television and not 
just on Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. Countering calls 
that the ballot papers be delivered to voters' homes, Interior 
Minister Ladislav Pittner said that "that which prevents 
manipulation in filling out the ballot papers is what is 
democratic." According to Pittner, the issuing of ballot papers 
on election day is customary in the neighboring countries. 
Besides, the citizen can familiarize himself with the 
candidates not only from the election campaign but also at his 
place of residence, where the lists of voters and electoral 
lists with the names of candidates and political parties will be 
posted 30 days before the elections. [passage omitted] 
  The deputies then passed an amendment to the law on the 
regulation of conduct of business with tobacco, salt, and 
spirits and on the abolition of state financial monopolies. The 
existing legislation awarded the exclusive--that is, 
monopoly--right to conducting business in these areas to 
state-owned enterprises, which was an obstacle to the 
development of economic competition. [passage omitted] 
  The NRSR bill on the social fund was put forward by P. 
Jakubik (Party of the Democratic Left) on behalf of a group of 
deputies. The bill was largely identical with the principles for 
the generation of the social fund that the government approved 
on 24 May. The only remaining disputed issue was the possibility 
of generating the social fund in loss-making companies (this 
idea was favored by the trade unions, while employers and the 
government were opposed). Ultimately, the deputies approved a 
version under which both commercial and nonprofit organizations 
will be obliged to set up the fund from 0.6 percent of the 
volume of wages or salaries paid out in the current year. This 
obligatory allocation will be included in the organization's 
expenditures (costs). Employers who made a profit [the year 
before] will also create the social fund from the company's 
costs. In the case of profit-making organizations, the social 
fund can amount to up to 1 percent [of the total wage bill]. 
The adopted law will come into force on 1 September 1994 for 
the production sphere and on 1 January 1995 for budget-funded 
and subsidized organizations. All contributions paid out to 
employees, in cash or in kind, will be subject to a special 
10-percent tax. The aim of the social fund is to grant employees 
certain material benefits, such as contributions to meals, 
transportation, or a supplementary pension insurance, and also 
the provision of nonreturnable social assistance. Of the 104 
deputies present, 67 voted in favor of the bill's passage, 17 
were against, and 18 abstained. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June 
and Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June both 
publish commentaries on waning support for Miklos Duray, 
chairman of the Coexistence Movement, among the Hungarian 
minority in Slovakia. 
  Bratislava SMENA in Slovak on 1 June on page 4 carries a 
500-word Milan Stanislav commentary entitled "A New Leader?" 
The commentator observes that, besides bringing a victory for 
the left, the Hungarian elections showed that Hungarian voters 
had rejected the "gaining of political capital out of 
nationalism." In Stanislav's opinion, this "signal" from 
Hungary is also likely to influence ethnic Hungarian voters in 
southern Slovakia. He continues: "Miklos Duray, in particular, 
has found himself in a difficult situation. In public opinion 
polls on trust in politicians, Duray has suffered the greatest 
loss of support, and Vojtech Bugar, who, by his moderate and 
realistic policy, has become the natural leader of the Hungarian 
ethnic minority, ranks above him by a wide margin. Miklos Duray 
also had to swallow a bitter pill at a meeting of the 
Coexistence Council when he had to agree to the idea of a 
three-member coalition that was advocated by Vojtech Bugar. Why 
did Mr. Duray oppose this idea? Most likely, he saw in the 
alliance of the moderate Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
[MKDH] with the liberal and level-headed Hungarian Civic Party 
[MOS] a strong competition for his own policy, which is marked 
by extremism. By trying to include the de facto nonexistent 
Hungarian People's Party in the contemplated `union of four 
[ethnic Hungarian] parties,' he tried to eliminate the influence 
of the MOS within this grouping. Because the idea of a union, 
based on the circumvention of the electoral law, did not meet 
with support, Coexistence sounded the retreat. Given the 
current distribution of electoral preferences within the 
Hungarian community, Coexistence would be risking a duel with a 
possible MKDH-MOS two-member coalition and would not have to get 
into parliament. Moreover, it also had to reckon with the 
Social Democratic bloc's campaign for the votes of Hungarian 
voters, who are influenced by the Socialists' victory in the 
neighboring country." 
  In conclusion, the commentator observes that Duray's 
"radical" statements "jeopardize dialogue between the minority 
and the government," which could threaten the passage of 
legislative norms benefiting the minority and strengthen the 
position of Slovak nationalist parties. 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 2 June on page 3 
carries a 600-word Emil Lopasovsky commentary entitled "Is Duray 
Losing Ground Under His Feet?" The commentator considers two 
recent incidents that, in his opinion, document a loss of 
support for the Coexistence chairman within the Hungarian 
minority. 
  First, Lopasovsky gives an account of a rally held in the 
overwhelmingly Hungarian community of Velka nad Iplom "late last 
week," which was attended by Miklos Duray. According to 
Lopasovsky, "Duray suffered a debacle" at Velka nad Iplom when 
the community's residents "ignored" his presence. According to 
the commentator, the company awaiting Duray consisted of his 
brother-in-law, his sister, the mayor of the community, and two 
journalists, who were subsequently joined by "a few elderly 
locals who had quickly emptied their mugs of beer in the pub 
across the street." The subsequent discussion reportedly 
demonstrated that Duray's "political steps and escalating 
demands are out of tune with the views of people about whom he 
pretends to be concerned." Particularly Duray's campaign 
against the so-called alternative education, whose aim is to 
improve ethnic Hungarians' command of the Slovak language, 
reportedly met with criticism. 
  The second indication of waning support for Duray, according 
to Lopasovsky, was the meeting of the Coexistence Council at 
Lucenec on 28 May, which advocated a coalition of ethnic 
Hungarian parties, in defiance of Duray's preference for the 
project of a union. Lopasovsky claims that "it was even rumored 
at Lucenec that Duray's chair in Coexistence is not quite 
stable."

    [Editorial Report] The 2 June 1994 issue of Bratislava 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak contains a four-page supplement 
entitled "HZDS" (Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) and 
subtitled "regular supplement of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia." On its front page, the supplement carries the 
following introductory statement by Dusan Kleiman, head of the 
HZDS Press and Information Section: "Esteemed readers. As of 
today, we are beginning to publish in the daily SLOVENSKA 
REPUBLIKA a regular HZDS supplement. In a situation when the 
attitude of the majority of the mass media toward the HZDS is 
more or less hostile, our possibilities of informing the public 
are limited. Our aim is to at least partly fill the gap this has 
created in the public. We want to brief you in some detail 
about developments within the HZDS and put across to you the 
HZDS positions on current developments in the sphere of 
politics, the economy, culture, the social sphere, and so forth. 
We hope to meet your expectations and to retain your favor." 
  The first issue of the supplement includes articles, 
interviews, and commentaries expressing HZDS positions on 
various recent developments (the motion of no-confidence in 
Privatization Minister Janicina, the Presidential Office's 
rejection of an HZDS-initiated referendum, the departure of 
Deputy Marian Kelemen from the HZDS group in parliament, the 
bill on conflicts of interest, the dismissal of district-office 
chiefs following their criticism of President Kovac, and the 
government's talks on the provision of an IMF loan). 
Contributors include members of the "shadow cabinet," such as 
former Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik, former Justice 
Minister Katarina Tothova, and former Transport and 
Communications Minister Roman Hofbauer.

<F P=106> [Article by Emil Bajanek: "Who Prevents Martin Engineering </F>
Works From Filling State Coffers? Incredible but True--the 
State Itself"] 
  [Text] Martin, the slimmed-down ZTS [Heavy Engineering 
Works] TEES Martin state enterprise, employs more than 4,800 
people today. After 1990, the company extended its civilian 
production program, in cooperation with the German Hanomag 
company, with bulldozers and belt loaders and introduced the 
production of Lombardini diesel engines under license. 
Nevertheless, the production of special technology still 
represents more than 50 percent of the engineering company's 
output. But let Engineer Jan Segla, the company's director, do 
the talking: 
  "In drafting our entrepreneurial plan for this year, we 
reckoned with two key matters--that we succeed in obtaining a 
government guarantee for the `India' contract and that we obtain 
a credit of 200 million korunas [Sk] to set the production of 
tractors in motion. So far, the government has not extended to 
us the guarantee for the contract, which involves the delivery 
of VT-72B retriever tanks worth $28 million for the Indian Army, 
and we also have not obtained credit to purchase material for 
the production of tractors, although the marketing of these 
tractors has been secured. These are exceptionally serious 
matters, the solution of which would permit us to make profit 
this year and to start properly fulfilling our duties toward the 
banks and internal revenue authorities. We had a singular 
chance to get out of the red, and about 20 percent of the 
company's employees would not have to be at home and collecting 
only a part of their wages, according to the Labor Code, as has 
been the case over the past few months." 
<H5>  Government's Sad Calling Card </H5>
  The contract for the delivery of 50 retriever tanks for 
India 
was signed in November 1993. Under the contract, the last tanks 
were to be delivered to India in January 1995. In keeping with 
the contract, by the end of January of this year, the Indian 
side deposited with Ceskoslovenska Obchodna Banka [Czechoslovak 
Foreign Trade Bank, CSOB] an advance payment of $5.6 million. 
Without a government guarantee, however, the bank cannot 
release the money for the ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise. 
After all, it is a state enterprise and not a private one. The 
Martin engineering company has Sk187 million deposited with the 
CSOB, which it badly needs to fulfill the contract. It is 
evident who benefits from this money. The previous government's 
promises about support for companies' export activities sound 
more or less grotesque in the face of this. Also, the new 
government is in no hurry to extend the guarantee. "If the 
government does not extend the guarantee soon, we are determined 
to stage protest actions," Frantisek Ladnak, chairman of the 
Kovo [metal workers] primary trade union organization in the ZTS 
TEES state enterprise, told us, and we could sense from his 
words that he meant it. 
  The people from Martin are honoring the contract, at the 
price of considerable sacrifice, and intend to fulfill it by the 
end of this year. Its total value is more than $28 million, 
and, so far, the company has invested more than Sk500 million 
from its own resources in its realization. Logically, it is 
short of this money when it comes to purchasing materials for 
civilian production. Incidentally, the Indian side is 
considering a fourfold expansion of the contract. 
<H5>  Invitation to Brno </H5>
  The specialized IDET exhibition [of defense industries] will 
be held in Brno this week. ZTS TEES Martin will display there 
the modernized version of the medium T-72 MI tank. It is 
equipped with a stronger engine, a reactive [reaktivna] 
protection of the turret, and installed aggregates [instalovane 
agregaty] that substantially improve its quality and combat 
specifications. Experts from NATO countries cooperated in the 
tank's modernization. Its selling price is $2-2.5 million. The 
production capacity enables the production of 120 of these tanks 
a year. Several armies of countries from so-called 
conflict-free regions have shown interest in purchasing the 
tank. The modernized tank will undoubtedly attract the interest 
of experts who will come to the Brno exhibition. 
  "We reckon with the production of special technology also in 
the future. However, it will not exceed one-half of the 
company's output," says director Jan Segla. During the visit to 
ZTS TEES Martin, we also learned that a new heavy tank is being 
developed, as well as a rapid-deployment small-armored vehicle, 
the Aligator, for army and police needs. 
  The development of civilian-production programs plays an 
equally important role in the company, however. The Martin 
company will continue expanding the production of diesel 
engines, road-building machinery, tractors, and other 
engineering products. Several foreign partners are contemplating 
establishing joint ventures with the Turec [region in north 
Slovakia, of which Martin is the center] engineering works. The 
company's privatization is becoming topical. Let us hope that 
the government will have a lucky hand in this case and, in view 
of the company's strategic importance, will not permit excessive 
fragmentation of its property. Foreign partners are following 
this with meticulous care. Only a smaller part of the factory's 
property should be privatized by means of coupons. The company 
should be gradually transformed into an employee-stockholding 
company and reorganized into the standard structure of a holding. 
  The ZTS TEES Martin state enterprise is going through a 
difficult period of its existence. It is owed some Sk3 billion 
by its customers; the Czech Motokov company alone owes it Sk900 
million. Following the federation's partition, some of the 
claims belong to the category of irrecoverable ones. One can 
identify with Engineer Jan Segla's view that, if the Slovak 
Government extended the aforementioned guarantee to the company, 
implemented the promised write-off of credit interest rates 
(Sk265 million), granted it a subsidy for conversion programs 
(Sk79 million), which had also been promised already, and 
allowed the company to sell off unnecessary property (Sk175 
million) by granting it an exception from the law, and if the 
company succeeded in obtaining from the bank a one-year loan of 
Sk250 million, ZTS TEES Martin could, as of next year, again 
contribute vitally needed resources to the state budget. The 
company does not need words about the protection of the domestic 
market and proexport policy. It needs the realization of 
systemic measures, the state's wise subsidy policy aimed at 
developmental programs, the alleviation of restrictive measures 
in the sphere of provision of financial resources, and an 
acceleration of the privatization process. In other words, it 
needs action from a government that cannot be indifferent to the 
prosperity of an enterprise that still belongs to the state. 
And someone should also seriously ponder the warning from the 
company's trade unionists.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Ivan Brozik; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brozik] You are currently 
holding talks with an Indian delegation visiting Slovakia. What 
are the plans of your government department in that country? 
  [Kanis] The Indian defense minister arrived on the basis of 
a cooperation plan, within the framework of previously concluded 
agreements. It is an official visit. Apart from holding talks 
on cooperation between the ministries of defense, the Indian 
guest will visit Slovak companies--[Tatra Sipox at] Banovce nad 
Bebravou, Konstrukta Trencin, ZTS [Heavy Engineering Works] 
Dubnica, ZTS Martin. Together, we will also pay a visit to the 
IDET exhibition in Brno. The Slovak exhibition will be our 
destination there. 
  [Brozik] Your reply suggests that these international talks 
and activities might be aimed at the recovery of our arms 
industry, to a certain degree. 
  [Kanis] I believe that the Slovak arms industry finds itself 
in its present problematic situation also because of the absence 
of an effective and sufficiently strong steering center in 
Slovakia. That is also why our manufacturers were unable to find 
their bearing when arms production was halted and the conditions 
for exporting arms deteriorated. The very change of the 
political line in the wake of the revolutionary changes did not 
have to bring about such a drastic weakening of arms production 
and such an enormous decline in arms exports. One only had to 
find one's bearing far more quickly and look for new customers. 
The number of potential new customers is fairly large. They 
are interested in weapons from Slovakia because of their quality 
and also because Slovakia, while being a small country, avails 
itself of a huge production potential. Many small countries are 
emerging in the world that are interested in building up an 
effective defense potential. In the long run, we have good 
chances in those countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Albino Cehic from the Croatian Government </F>
building in Zagreb] 
  [Text] Official talks between a delegation of the Romanian 
Government, headed by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and a 
delegation of the Croatian Government, headed by Prime Minister 
Nikica Valentic are under way here. Soon after his arrival in 
Zagreb, the Romanian prime minister laid a wreath at the 
monument to the Croatian homeland in Medvedgrad. As I have just 
said, the official talks are now underway. The talks are 
focused on economic issues. 
  After the high-ranking officials of the two delegations were 
introduced, Prime Minister Valentic informed his eminent guest 
about great changes in the Croatian economy. In his 
introductory speech, Valentic said that there are no political 
or economic problems between Croatia and Romania. The two prime 
ministers agreed that this is a precondition for doing more in 
the econmic sphere, because possibilities abound. In this 
respect, trade should be developed despite the fact that Croatia 
is not yet completely free. 
  The Romanian delegation will stay in Croatia until Wednesday 
[8 June], when agreements on marine transport and the protection 
of investments will be signed. 
  Talks between economic experts of the two delegations will 
soon open in the Croatian Economic Chamber. Later today the 
guests from Romania will visit the president of the Assembly, 
Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.

  [Text] Official talks between the Romanian and Croatian 
delegations, led by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu and his 
Croatian counterpart Nikica Valentic, started today in Zagreb. 
Mr. Vacaroiu emphasized that Romania is very concerned with 
developing the economic relations between the two countries and 
with creating the necessary legal framework for economic 
cooperation. 
  According to our special correspondent in Zagreb, the 
Croatian prime minister presented the development stage of his 
country's economy, which is in full swing of stabilization, and 
stressed that the Republic of Croatia is also using Romania's 
experience as a model. Both sides emphasized that the economic 
potential of the two countries facilitates good relations of 
cooperation in the spheres of investments, transportation, 
health, and scientific research. We are convinced that the 
visit will conclude with the envisaged results, the Romanian 
prime minister said. The Romanian delegation will be received 
by the parliament speaker and the mayor of Zagreb in the 
afternoon.

<F P=106> [Article by "joe": "People Interested in the Modernization </F>
of the Army of the Czech Republic Have to Wait"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Army is unable to secure a complex 
modernization of its arsenal by its own manufacturing and repair 
capacities. In view of the scope of the work on the 
modernization projects, it will be impossible to announce the 
future demands of the Army of the Czech Republic before the end 
of July, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said at a news 
conference yesterday. Priorities are already known, however. 
They are computer systems, communications, the unification of 
command, the modernization of T-72 and T-55 tanks, the 
modernization of the MiG-21 plane, the development of a light 
multipurpose plane, the L-159. Technical details have not been 
specified as yet. 
  The minister strongly emphasizes the modernization of the 
Army's technical equipment because the costs linked to 
modernization amount to 25-30 percent of the costs for 
developing or buying new technology. According to Baudys, all 
top firms in the world that are engaged in transforming older 
military technology into modernized versions or are 
manufacturers of this equipment have shown an interest in 
cooperation. When asked about the possibility of cooperation 
with Israel, Baudys described Israel as a country that has 
exceptional combat experience and whose philosophy of building 
the army and weapon systems is very close to ours, but he 
adopted a cautious stance on relations with Russia. "As regards 
cooperation with Russia, we were offered the possibility of our 
claims being compensated by arms deliveries. But, the Army and 
its arsenal cannot become dependent on a country whose 
development can be very complicated. Weapons systems, which are 
acquired for decades, have to be bought in countries that 
provide a guarantee of economic and political stability," the 
minister said.

made public that there are positively screened generals or 
colonels in some senior posts in the Army. 
  The minister refused to say, however, in what way and by 
whom 
exactly the law was infringed. It was only apparent from his 
statement that the law was infringed in the case of soldiers 
serving in posts held by colonels. "Certain inconsistencies 
were found, which, however, have already been cleared up. These 
were really individual cases and did not involve any army 
general. Nevertheless, this was a certain infringement of the 
law," he said, without specifying what has been done to remedy 
the situation. 
  Only a week ago, however, the minister denied that 
positively 
screened officers were serving in the Army. The director of the 
Defense Ministry's Personnel Department, Jaroslav Cuhra, also 
said that the Screenings Law was not infringed in the Army. 
Baudys had unequivocally discounted the possibility that anyone 
with a positive screenings certificate could currently be 
serving in a colonel's or general's post. 
  In connection with Generals Karel Pezl and Rostislav Kotil, 
who, according to some of the media, had been assigned false 
screenings certificates, the minister yesterday maintained that 
the two men comply with the conditions for executing their 
duties and that they have been accused wrongly.

<F P=106> [Article by Marta Stolarova: "It Is Possible To Capitalize </F>
Russian Debts"] 
  [Text] "We have worked out all of the possible 
alternatives, with the proviso that, if a solution in the form 
of deliveries of goods, capitalization, or barter operations 
fails, we would, in any case, pay our debt in freely convertible 
currency. The Czech side is thus being offered a wide range of 
promising opportunities, and we have naturally pledged our 
support to the accepted projects in every way." That is what 
the deputy finance minister of the Russian Federation, who had 
dealings in Prague regarding the repayment of the Russian debt 
to the Czech Republic, said yesterday in an exclusive interview 
for HOSPODARSKE NOVINY and Russian Television. "The Russian side 
has kept all of its promises. I have been empowered to sign the 
treaty in Prague. However, the treaty still has to undergo a 
certain approval procedure," he added. 
  When asked what portion of the liabilities could be 
capitalized, A. Vavilov replied that a large part of the debt 
qualifies for this solution, such as balance in transferable 
rubles and a part of other types of debt. "We assume that 
mainly the part of the debt that arose during trade exchange 
could be resolved in this form, but there is nothing on our side 
to prevent us from compensating the debt we have in free [volny] 
currencies in this way, too." 
  We were interested in whether there was already a list of 
appropriate enterprises. On this subject, Vavilov said that the 
State Property Committee of the Russian Federation 
(Goskomimushchestvo) was engaged in great activity in 
cooperation with Czech partners. "Works continue, but we would 
like to see them progress faster," he said. 
  In connection with the planned capitalization of claims, he 
pointed to Russia's efforts to create more favorable conditions 
for foreign investments. He mentioned the set of President 
Yeltsin's decrees on profit taxing in enterprises with foreign 
property participation. If the foreign capital share exceeds 30 
percent and the overall investment exceeds 200 million rubles, 
the enterprise does not have to pay taxes for two years and pays 
only 25 percent of taxes in the third year and one-half in the 
fourth; only in the fifth year does it pay a full federal rate. 
According to the deputy minister, it is possible to expect that 
regional authorities, too, will adopt similar conditions to 
attract foreign capital. 
  When asked by Russian television for which side the 
initialed 
treaty was more advantageous, Vavilov replied that "if it is 
initialed, it is anticipated that it is mutually beneficial; 
however, in case of debts, the situation is complicated." He 
admitted that, in any case, both the creditor and the debtor 
will get a clearer idea from the schedule of installments. "All 
of the agreements on restructuring its debt signed by the 
Russian Federation in the two most recent years are being 
precisely met. Debts of the former USSR are an exception and are 
the subject of regular discussion with the Paris Club, the 
London Club, and other creditors." 
  Russia is also an important creditor of a number of 
developing countries. The overall sum of its claims is 
difficult to determine precisely (estimate runs over $100 
billion) and realizing these assets is very difficult," Deputy 
Minister Vavilov said. "Specifically, in the agreement (with the 
Czech Republic), we are counting on the possibility of barter 
operations--that is, with swapping Russian assets in certain 
countries for the debt in the Czech Republic, which is currently 
negotiating its claims with, for instance, Asian debtor 
countries. Here, too, it is likely that we will find mutually 
acceptable alternative solutions," the Russian representative 
said.

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Storek: "The Government Assesses the </F>
Economic Trends Favorably"] 
  [Excerpt] The Czech Republic Government discussed a report 
on the fulfillment of the state budget during the first quarter 
of this year at its session yesterday. According to Prime 
Minister Klaus, it "used this debate to assess recent economic 
trends." 
  From the point of view of the state budget, altogether 
positive figures are involved, which, according to Klaus, "is 
very different from the state budgets of neighboring countries." 
The state budget's balance is, said the prime minister, in the 
black up to 31 May and amounts to 4.2 billion korunas. Klaus 
"makes no secret of the fact that the worsening clearing balance 
with Slovakia has contributed significantly to this." If this 
clearing is unfavorable, the state budget must grant it credit, 
and thus the development of the clearing balance "plays 
considerably into the hands of the Czech state budget and begins 
to make the life of the Slovak state budget complicated." 
Despite the fact that the report is not, according to Klaus, 
"exaggeratedly optimistic," "distinct shoots that provide a 
reason for calm and hopeful forecasts for the future" are 
outlined here, the prime minister summed up. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Spurny: "The Director General of the </F>
Arms Consortium Has Fallen From Grace"] 
  [Text] The RDP Group, the Czech consortium of arms 
companies, has been waiting six weeks to find out whether it 
will obtain permission from the government to trade in arms. It 
seems that it is waiting in vain. In accordance with the new 
law on foreign trade in military hardware, four 
ministries--Industry, Interior, Defense, and Foreign--have been 
making their views known on such requests since April. 
Meanwhile, it is apparent from unofficial reports that at least 
three of the aforementioned departments--Defense, Foreign, and 
Interior--do not approve of granting a license to the RDP Group. 
The Cernin Palace obviously cannot overlook the scandal last 
December when the chairman of the RDP Group board, Lubomir 
Soudek, offered Iranian fundamentalists not only conventional 
weapons but also components for their nuclear program. And, 
[Defense Minister] Baudys's department again has unsettled 
accounts with the consortium's director general, Jan Vlcek. 
  A definitive decision should be made next week. A great deal 
of money is at stake for the RDP Group's top brass, and, 
therefore, anxiety is increasing with the approaching date. The 
most recent development indicates that the company is still 
trying at the last moment to improve its image before state 
officials: On Friday, 27 May, Director Vlcek was recalled. 
<H5>  Half a Billion Dollars Into the Bargain </H5>
  At the end of January 1994, Jan Vlcek turned to Industry 
Minister Dlouhy with a request for support in a lucrative order 
for Iran: The RDP Group wanted to export a repair assembly line 
for tanks for $0.5 billion. Vladimir Dlouhy asked [Interior 
Minister] Jan Ruml, [Foreign Minister] Josef Zieleniec, and 
Antonin Baudys for their opinions on the contract. Of course, 
Vlcek's letter came at a time when the worldwide reaction to 
Lubomir Soudek's Teheran "atomic mission" had still not died 
down, so the ministers were very constrained and all of them 
objected to the deal. The Army was most acerbic: It was 
astounded that the RDP Group director had proposed a state 
military enterprise as the final supplier for the order without 
even consulting the Defense Ministry first. Thus, Vlcek, and 
his company along with him, acquired yet another inauspicious 
reputation on top of the incommodious contract: "In view of the 
consortium's reckless business activities, I consider its 
participation in Czech Army projects to be completely out of the 
question," wrote Antonin Baudys to his colleague Dlouhy. An 
arms company that cannot sell its products and services to the 
army of its own country has, of course, according to the 
experts, absolutely no chance in the market. 
  At roughly the same time that the RDP Group received a 
negative response from the Industry Ministry to its Iranian 
request, the consortium's management founded the RDP Group 
Marketing subsidiary limited company. "The explanation is 
simple," claims Jaroslav Skrobanek from the company's 
management. "Our founding documents were very vague about 
trading in arms, and this may not be enough in possible 
negotiations on a license for a specific order. Therefore, a 
subsidiary company was founded whose main function is commercial 
activity." According to the economic experts, however, another 
explanation is also possible: The subsidiary company is 
intended to detract attention from the RDP Group itself; its 
reckless activities "spread" among the public, and the 
consortium was faced with the risk that it would not obtain any 
license for trade in military material. In view of the fact that 
the RDP Group board alone controls the Marketing company and not 
the general assembly, possible business deals will become, on 
top of this, "more unintelligible" to the shareholders. There 
are now more than 40 of them; altogether, these are enterprises 
involved--to a greater or lesser extent--in arms production. 
<H5>  Cherchez la Femme </H5>
  So, instead of the RDP Group, its subsidiary company applied 
for general permission to conduct trade, as the new law 
prescribes for military hardware. Then, within the framework of 
other "purgative" measures, along came the aforementioned recall 
of Director General Vlcek. He was replaced by Viktorie Hradska, 
the former chairwoman of the Liberal Democratic Party and an 
unsuccessful candidate for the post of ambassador to Hungary. 
RDP Group representatives have described her "ability to 
conduct negotiations" as the new director's main qualification 
for the job. 
  Whether these modifications to improve the company's 
battered 
reputation will suffice will become apparent in the very near 
future. The head of the department for special materials at the 
Industry Ministry, Josef Gregr, who is responsible for granting 
licenses, already has at his disposal all of the points of view 
from the key departments. At the moment, in view of the 
continuing administrative proceedings, he is refusing to divulge 
any information about the future of the RDP Group Marketing 
limited company.

  [Text] In connection with a statement made by Serbian 
Radical Party Chairman Vojislav Seselj in Novi Banovci, that all 
Croats ought to be evicted from Serbia, the Democratic Alliance 
of Vojvodina Croats issued a public statement today saying: 
  The Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats vehemently 
protests against Seselj's statement and appeals to all Croats in 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to not be afraid, as Seselj 
is only providing the International War Crimes Tribunal with new 
evidence against himself. Seselj is simplifying consequences of 
the disintegration of the communist system and is offering 
solutions through ethnic cleansing, i.e. genocide, in order to 
reopen the circle of violence and conflicts and thus prolong the 
time in which violence would rule over reason, ethics, and 
morals, says the statement of the Democratic Alliance of 
Vojvodina Croats that was made public in Subotica today.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Government's Analyses of </F>
Stabilization Processes"] 
  [Text] The stabilization program of the Macedonian [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Government is 
globally being realized. The achieved economic results are 
within government expectations. This was published in the 
Ministry of Development's report on realization of the 1994 
government's stabilization program in the first months of this 
year. This is immediately followed by references to several 
unexpected moments, more or less neglected at the very 
beginning. The Greek embargo is the central such problem, along 
with all of its harmful consequences. The inability to purchase 
raw materials, increased transportation costs, inability to 
distribute products to foreign markets -- all contributed to 
reduced production and even closing down of certain factories. 
Lower production figures resulted in lower supply, decreased 
ability of financing the current production and public sector, 
and, finally, increase in deficit, especially in the economy. 
The country's balance of payments is also disturbed as 
Macedonia is not able to make use of the credits agreed on with 
the World Bank, previously realized through import of equipment 
and raw materials. 
  The economy continues to be highly insolvable and under a 
blow of high bank interests rates not duly coordinated with the 
fall of inflation. All of this presents a danger of wider 
social unrest and failure of the stabilization program. 
  On the other hand, limited wages, along with the stable 
course of the denar and restrictive monetary and public 
expenditure polices, kept prices down. The inflation is in 
rapid decrease ever since the beginning of the year -- February 
market prices fell to 6.8 percent and to 2.4 percent in March 
and April -- and all this is far below the inflation predicted 
with the stabilization program. The government is also 
satisfied with public expenditure figures -- the adopted fiscal 
regulations announce lowering in deficits. The finances 
required for public needs were 11.8 billion denars in the first 
three months of this year, which is a real increase of 39 
percent as compared to the same period last year. The budget 
income has increased by 47.6 percent and that of social funds by 
26.2 percent. Nonetheless, the dynamics of income was not in 
accordance with the outcome. Positive results were reached only 
in the pension fund, the deficit for which was lowered from 367 
million denars in January to 215.4 million denars in February 
and only 57.9 million denars in March. But the government 
neglected the personal tax. 
  The total monetary mass in the first three months was in 
coordination with financial transactions and demand for cash. 
As for the foreign currency sector, courses of hard currencies 
are stable, although this is achieved at the cost of imports, 
which the government is aware of. The exports decreased by 13.1 
percent in the first 3 months, whereas the imports increased by 
8.7 percent. 
  The government mostly criticizes its program for slow 
implementation of structural reforms in the real and financial 
sectors. The planned reconstruction of 25 firms with biggest 
losses is slowed down by slow privatization and control over it, 
and overstepped deadlines for privatization. 
  The government is making efforts to be ready for unexpected 
problems in the social welfare. It is preparing 8,000 denars 
aid for citizens who will lose jobs, as well as increased aid 
for the 50,000 families receiving welfare. For this purpose, 
the government is raising funds now, so that it prevents wider 
social unrest.

CSO 

  [Editorial Report] On 29 April the Macedonian-language 
Skopje daily NOVA MAKEDONIJA publishes on page 4 a report by 
L.K. on the 28 April news conference of the Constitutional Court 
of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). Jordan 
Arsov, chairman of the Constitutional Court, told reporters that 
the year 1993 stands out because of the great number of cases 
involved and because of the "peculiar" atmosphere in which the 
court had to function. Reviewing the court's activities, Arsov 
said the court had reviewed 76 laws and 42 regulations, that is, 
twice as many as in 1992 and, in fact, the largest number of 
cases in the court's 30-year history. Cases involving the 
defense of the rights and liberties of individuals and citizens 
had grown significantly. There had also been initiatives 
contesting the constitutionality of the programs and statutes of 
three political parties. 
  The news conference brought out the fact that the court had 
ruled 13 laws unconstitutional; these related to the sale of 
socially owned housing, the republic's judicial council, the 
public prosecutor, public control over prices, basic rights to 
pensions and to disability insurance, expropriation of property, 
games of chance, defense, radio broadcasting, protection and 
utilization of farmland, the cabinet government, tax on turnover 
of goods and services, and the reassignment of common premises 
in housing. Because the court questioned the compatibility of 
some laws with the Constitution, it ordered an appraisal of 
these laws. The most significant laws involved in this ongoing 
process concern internal affairs, criminal procedure, energy, 
preschool and primary education, preventive medicine, housing 
relationships, forests, and the Chamber of Commerce. To uphold 
the Constitution, the court also produced 50 intervening 
decisions; among these 47 were repealed and seven were annuled. 
This represents 42 percent of the total number of cases appealed 
to the court during the year. This type of activity constituted 
30 percent of the court's cases during 1992. From this increase, 
NOVA MAKEDONIJA's reporter says, one can conclude that there 
have been significant constitutional and legal infringements. 
  According to the NOVA MAKEDONIJA reporter, the journalists 
used the forum to ask about the court's recent decision that 
license plates would have to have Cyrillic, rather than Latin, 
letters. The justices refuted the "epithets" made about this 
decision by Minister of Interior Frckovski at his news 
conference. They emphasized that the decision had been made 
unanimously. In the ensuing discussion, the justices explained 
some aspects of the court's operation and expressed concern over 
the lack of cooperation on the part of some legislators.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic 
returned from Geneva to Sarajevo this evening. He stated that 
the international mediators have been trying to impose a 
take-it-or-leave-it solution by exerting pressure on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, stressing that the contact group said it 
would put forward its proposal in a week or two. We are not 
pleased with the proposal of the territorial division in eastern 
Bosnia, and there are no instruments of coercion. Therefore, we 
are wondering how any kind of agreement would be implemented, 
Silajdzic added. He also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina demanded 
that NATO offer guarantees for the implementation of the 
agreement and secure Bosnia-Herzegovina's borders in case the 
peace agreement is accepted. Bosnia-Herzegovina also demands 
specific plans for the return of refugees and clear guarantees 
that reconstruction aid will be provided. Silajdzic announced 
that members of the contact group would visit Sarajevo in 
approximately 10 days to resume negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kresimir Zubak, president of the Federation </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by S. Lovrenovic, place and date not

  [Text] After his election as the first president of the 
Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we asked Mr. Kresimir Zubak to 
give his first interview to VECERNJI LIST in his new post. 
  [Lovrenovic] You have just been elected president of the 
Federation. What is your first task in your new post? 
  [Zubak] The first thing is that, in the capacity of 
delegates of both the Federation and the state delegation of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we are supposed to negotiate in 
Geneva with the representatives of the Serbian people regarding 
the cease-fire, and then on 6 and 7 June, in Talloires, to 
continue negotiations on the political part of resolving 
relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina, that is, establishing a final 
peace. 
<H5>  Two Initiatives </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Why have the negotiations now been split 
between Geneva and Talloires? 
  [Zubak] Two initiatives are involved here. One, in Geneva, 
conducted by Mr. Akashi, has as its aim the establishment of a 
cease-fire, while the other is an initiative of the contact 
group member countries, whose aim is to mediate between the 
warring factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to attain a 
final peace, that is, to finally define the political and legal 
relations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Lovrenovic] What are the tasks connected to the functioning 
of the Federation? 
  [Zubak] As far as the Federation is concerned, Mr. [Vice 
President Ejup] Ganic and I -- within the framework of our 
authority -- should undertake everything to commence the 
implementation of the provisions of the Federation Constitution, 
and that concretely means that we should launch an initiative 
for the establishment of bodies of authority. In this respect, 
one of the first tasks is the establishment of the Federation 
Government. 
  [Lovrenovic] Are we essentially talking about a 
reconstruction of the existing Bosnia-Herzegovina Government? 
  [Zubak] At the last meeting of the Constituent Assembly, 
when we adopted the Constitution of the Federation, we also 
adopted a constitutional law in which we stipulated that, 
instead of two governments, the government of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which should have continued working -- and 
the Federation Government -- as a new body of executive power in 
the Federation -- should be reconstructed as the government of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina so that it is, at the same 
time, the government of the Federation. 
  We agreed that Mr. Ganic and I should appoint the government 
within 15 days, and then the Constituent Assembly, acting 
pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution, should ratify it 
and proclaim the Federation Government. 
<H5>  Changes to the Federation Constitution </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Will the new "Vienna maps" be staunchly 
insisted upon and the Constitution of the Federation changed, or 
will you wait for the development of negotiations with the third 
side? 
  [Zubak] At the last session of the Constituent Assembly, an 
initiative was launched for the amendment of the Federation 
Constitution, since the present solution -- that is, the 
solution that we achieved in the course of the Vienna 
negotiations on the establishment of two mixed cantons -- 
requires that the Constitution is first amended, because we have 
envisaged that in the cantons, authority should be organized 
according to the principle of the organization of authority on 
the level of the Federation, which presupposes amending the 
Constitution. That is why we launched the initiative yesterday. 
According to the Federation Constitution, a period of 15 days 
must elapse during which the Constitution is amended, and only 
then can a new session of the Assembly be convened and the 
amendments to the Federation Constitution either adopted or not. 
  [Lovrenovic] The Vienna maps caused quite a stir, there were 
protests; how do things stand now? 
  [Zubak] The Constituent Assembly passed a decision on the 
adoption of the Vienna agreements. This means that on the basis 
of the Vienna agreement, in addition to the Constitution 
amendments, we also need to pass laws on the cantons, grand 
duchys [velezupe] that is, their territory, and so forth. This 
is a long process and I believe that we will be able to define 
the territory of the cantons only after the entire peace process 
is completed, that is, when an agreement is reached with the 
Serbian side. 
  [Lovrenovic] You and Vice President Ganic have called on the 
Serbs to join you either within the framework of the Federation 
or some other union. What other variants exist? 
  [Zubak] We have several variants. One of them involves 
establishing a loose, very loose community -- based on a 
constitutional arrangement -- between the Federation and the 
part of the territory on which the Serbs are now a majority. 
According to another variant, on which we insist, we are 
offering that the Serbs join us under the same conditions as the 
Croats and the Bosniak-Muslims. Between these two extremes 
there exists the possibility of several variants. 
<H5>  I Am Against Haste </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] With your election, the Federation should begin 
to function, but authority is still divided on the ground, there 
are refugees, expelled persons; not much seems to have changed. 
  [Zubak] Although they insisted that a six-month limit should 
be allotted for the complete implementation of the Federation 
Constitution, I was skeptical about this. I had quite a few 
reserves because I know and I believe that I can objectively 
assess the situation on the ground. The most essential thing 
for me is to maintain the established cease-fire, to avoid fresh 
conflicts, and to gradually implement each segment of the 
Federation. I am against haste. This means that the Federation 
will not cease to exist if we do not implement everything that 
we have envisaged within six months. 
  [Lovrenovic] Who is going to represent Bosnia-Herzegovina 
before the international community? 
  [Zubak] This is a somewhat complicated situation. Namely, 
in transitional periods everywhere, and in similar situations, 
there is always duality and quite a vacuum in the legal system. 
It was simply impossible to cut short the situation, to say 
this that has existed until now is no longer valid, and 
something new is valid now. This novelty cannot immediately 
come into effect because the legal system and the bodies of 
authority need to be introduced gradually. The provisions of 
the Constitution clearly state that the Presidency and the 
Government of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina retain all 
authority in accordance with the existing Constitution until the 
final peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina is implemented, 
providing this authority does not influence any of the 
government's authority established by this Constitution. The 
formulation is a bit clumsy, but it is obvious that the 
Presidency and the bodies of authority of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should not encroach on the authority of the 
Federation's bodies of authority that have been organized 
according to the Constitution of the Federation. This is 
somewhat complicated, but we must solve all these problems 
through agreements, negotiations. After all, the agreement on 
the compositions of the delegations for negotiations is one such 
concrete example of how things should be done. Namely, this 
delegation is simultaneously the delegation of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. We 
shall have to do many things in this way in order to secure 
legitimacy in accordance with both constitutions and to avoid 
possible fresh conflicts. 
<H5>  Herceg-Bosna Until the Establishment of Cantons </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] There was specualtion in a part of the press 
that this Federation has been imposed on the Croats and the 
Bosniaks. What is your view of this? 
  [Zubak] Some people claim that these agreements are 
exclusively to the advantage of the Croatian people. Others 
believe that they are exclusively in the interest of the 
Bosniak-Muslim people. I believe that the Washington Agreement 
is, objectively, in the interest of both peoples. We have 
accepted it as such, therefore, the solution has not been forced 
on us, we only had a mediator, the U.S. Administration in this 
case. This is not a forced solution, but the U.S. 
Administration did apply certain pressure to achieve the 
agreement as soon as possible. 
  [Lovrenovic] You have mainly been negotiating with Dr. 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris] Silajdzic. Now Dr. 
Ganic has been elected vice-president. Have you had any 
contacts? 
  [Zubak] I have talked to him on several occasions. I had 
some contacts earlier and based on this I can say that I have 
concluded that this is a person who knows how to argue and 
defend his position and represent the interests of his people, 
but at the same time I believe that he is a person who wishes to 
and knows how to take into account the interest of the other, in 
this case, the Croatian people. 
  [Lovrenovic] You are also the president of the Presidential 
Council of the Croatian community of Herceg-Bosna. Will you 
remain in this post? 
  [Zubak] Yes. This will continue to function as a 
transitional solution, until the cantonal bodies of authority 
are established. 
  [Lovrenovic] Will relations with the Serbs be solved at the 
"green table" or on the front? 
  [Zubak] I believe that we should try to negotiate with the 
Serbs as well, because it is in our interest not to have any 
more casualties and losses. It is in everyone's interest. 
However, if we propose solutions and such solutions are 
accepted by the international community as objective, realistic, 
and suitable for the third people, yet their leadership rejects 
them, then we have the legitimate right to employ other ways and 
means -- including arms -- to protect, that is, realize our 
rights.

<F P=106> [Report by the Information Service of 107th Knightly </F>
Motorized Brigade from Gradacac] 
  [Text] A fierce artillery attack on Gradacac has been 
underway since early morning. At 0400 the aggressor began an 
all-out attack. So far today, more than 30 of the 
largest-caliber howitzer shells from Skugric have struck at the 
town center. At the same time, tanks in Turic [words 
indistinct] and Bucje are attacking the town and the surrounding 
area, while 120-mm mortars are literally showering the 
industrial zone and the access roads. Bearing in mind that the 
defense lines, especially in the region of Novalic, Sibovac, and 
Mionica are being attacked from 82-mm mortars together with 
intensified fire from antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft 
guns, and infantry arms, this morning has been one of the most 
dramatic of late. 
  While Serbian politicians are supposedly championing peace 
[words indistinct] the fascist policy are savagely attacking the 
civilians of this town. At the time of this dispatch, Gradacac 
is veiled in smoke caused by grenades of the largest calibers. 
For the time being we do not have any reports on possible 
casualties of this attack, which is still underway.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Snipers from the 
Moslem-held part of Sarajevo on Monday [6 June] continued to 
fire at Serb parts of the city, violating the agreement on a 
ceasefire on the Sarajevo battlefront, the Sarajevo-Romanija 
Corps of the Bosnian Serb republic army said on Monday. Snipers 
from the Moslem section of Dobrinja-Five and Stupsko Brdo were 
firing at the Serb section of Nedjarici and the Kasindolska 
Street, while they were opening fire from Browning machine-guns 
at the Serb section of Hadzici from their stronghold on Mt. 
Ormanj. 
  Moslem units also contimued to fortify their positions in 
the 
sections of Mojmilo and Debelo Brdo. On Monday, the Moslems 
went on with their attacks launched eight days ago on the 
defence positions of the army of the Bosnian Serb republic 
around Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf), said the 1st Krajina 
Corps of the Bosnian Serb republic army.

  [Text] Brcko, June 6 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croats on Monday 
evening shelled from multiple rocket launchers civilian targets 
in the Serb town of Brcko in the north, TANJUG's correspondent 
reports. 
  An all-out alert has been sounded in the town. 
  According to incomplete reports, the attack was launched 
from 
the Croat positions at Vucilovci around Orasje, some seven 
kilometres northwest of Brcko. There are no reports on 
casualties, but material damage is extensive. This was the 
seventh artillery attack on Brcko in the past four weeks, and 
the fourth launched from Bosnian Croat positions. In all four 
attacks, the Croats used 128-mm shells. The Moslems mostly use 
tank shells. The first six attacks left seven people dead and 
40 wounded, including several children. 
  U.N. observers, who have been deployed in Brcko since May 7, 
have conducted their own investigations into all the attacks on 
Brcko, which is situated at the neck of the vital corridor 
linking the eastern and western parts of the Bosnian Serb 
Republic. 
  The Serbs on May 7 proclaimed a unilateral truce in the 
Brcko 
area and reached agreement with U.N. peacekeepers on the 
deployment of U.N. observers in the town. Early in May, the 
local Croat commander in Orasje announced an all-out attack on 
Brcko by the combined Croat-Moslem force whose only aim, he 
said, was to cut the Serb corridor along the Sava River.

  [Text] Zvornik, June 5 (TANJUG) -- Although Bosnian Moslem 
forces, assisted by Bosnian Croats and troops of the regular 
army of the Republic of Croatia, are continuing attacks on the 
territory of the republic of Srpska all Serbian defence 
positions are completely stable and Bosnian Serb army troops 
will continue to resolutely prevent any violation of the 
territory of the republic of Srpska, Bosnian Serb army officials 
said on Sunday [5 June]. 
  Armed provocations by Croats are most frequently reported in 
the valley of the river Sava in north-eastern Bosnia, said the 
sources. The Serb side does not react to provocations but when 
the other side launches offensive actions it uses its legitimate 
right to self-defence, they said. 
  Bosnian Serb forces effictively repulsed several Moslem 
artillery and infantry attacks in the region of Teslic in the 
north-eastern part of Bosnia and one on Mount Ozren. They also 
prevented infiltration of a Moslem terrorist group. Serb parts 
of Sarajevo, especially Ilijas, again came under fire from 
Moslem positions in Sarajevo, said the sources. 
  The ceasefire agreement for the Sarajevo region is also 
being 
violated by continuous sniper and small arms fire from the 
Moslem part of Sarajevo on the Serb suburb of Nedzarici and from 
the central party of the city on Ozren Street, said the Serb 
army sources. 
  Moslem snipers in Sarajevo on Friday severely wounded a 
Russian and a French member of the United Nations Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) but UNPROFOR has so far not reacted to the 
incident.

<F P=106> [Report by Borisav Djuric] </F>
  [Text] After a fragile lull of several days, the Muslims 
have continued their attacks on the Srbobran [Donji Vakuf] 
front. Members of the 7th Corps of the Muslim army early this 
morning carried out a fierce artillery-infantry attack on the 
Koscani plateau. The fighters of the Army of the Serbian 
Republic were ready for this attack. After fierce fighting, the 
Muslims were repelled, suffering major losses in manpower. On 
the Serbian side, several fighters were wounded slightly. NATO 
aircraft were again the allies of the Muslims, flying low over 
the combat area. 
  It was quieter on other parts of the Srbobran front. In 
fact, this is only a brief lull before a new advance by Islamic 
fundamentalists. It is completely clear that the Muslim 
offensive, which started exactly seven days ago, will continue. 
Although the enemy suffered a large number of casualties in the 
first part of this offensive, the 7th Corps is persistently 
trying to take hold of Serbian territories, even if it means 
over the dead bodies of its soldiers. 
  Although an air raid alarm has been sounded, the enemy 
artillery in Bugojno has not been pounding Srbobran today.

  [Ttext] Brcko, June 5 (TANJUG) -- Moslem and Croat forces 
are continuing attacks on Serb positions and settlements in 
northern and central Bosnia-Herzegovina despite U.N. efforts to 
reach a comprehensive ceasefire at the Geneva talks. Bosnian 
Serb sources announced on Sunday that local Bosnian Croat troops 
and units of the regular Croatian army from the Orasje region 
(northern Bosnia) on Saturday evening used tanks, 60mm mortars, 
anti-aircraft guns and infantry weapons to attack Serb positions 
eight km south and southwest of Orasje. The attacks failed to 
cause any damage and the Bosnian Serb army held their fire. The 
Moslems continued offensive actions in the region of Srbobra 
(former Donji Vakuf), and Mt. Vlasic (central Bosnia) where they 
are also regrouping and massing reinforcements. In the Vlasic 
front, the Moslems used 128mm light rocket launchers and heavy 
mortars.

Federation President Zubak said: We have completed the first 
round of talks, during which we presented to Mr. Akashi our 
proposal for an agreement which would mean the cessation of 
hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The essence of our proposals 
is that the deadlines and modalities of establishing a 
cease-fire should not lead to the freezing of the current 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President Zubak said. 
  Federation Vice President Ganic added that he expects a new 
round of talks at 1700, not with [Bosnian Serb leader] Karadzic 
but with Akashi and his team of military experts who are 
supported by cochairman Stoltenberg and a UN team. 
  Secretary-General Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Akashi 
had a meeting in the Palais des Nations this afternoon. They 
discussed the modalities and deadlines for a cease-fire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The United Nations is hoping that the 
cease-fire negotiations will begin today.

  [Text] Some 45 foreign and 255 Bulgarian journalists 
covered the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress, which 
opened today. Our reporter Lilyana Yancheva, who will summarize 
the first day of the congress, was among them. 
  [Yancheva] I would like to say that the report that party 
leader Zhan Videnov read today was well-received by the 
delegates, despite the fact that statements made during the 
afternoon debate were rather critical. This is precisely what I 
want to ask Mr. Videnov, who is sitting next to me: What do you 
think were the most essential and critical elements in the 
statements of the delegates who came to the congress from all 
parts of the country. 
  [Videnov] I think that it is too early to say precisely what 
the focus of the discussion was, what the basic conflict it 
engenders is, and what direction the possible resolution will 
take. I think that the congress will determine the country's 
political calendar for the current year, and our resolution will 
contain the opinion of the Bulgarian Socialists regarding the 
tests that lie ahead. The fact that the congress agenda was 
amended today proves this. Now it contains the BSP election 
platform. 
  A dispute broke out regarding the question of whether the 
democratic character of the transition will be guaranteed if a 
governmental and parliamentary crisis develops; guarantees were 
sought for a future leftist or leftist-centrist government, 
including listening to the opinions of our present and potential 
coalition partners. I think that this subject will unfold 
tomorrow, during the second day of the congress. 
  [Yancheva] There were some very interesting statements on 
the part of Roma delegates to the congress; they voiced 
interesting claims. 
  [Videnov] The Bulgarian Romas have the right to present 
claims to all political forces, state institutions, and public 
organizations. They have an exceptionally unequal social 
status, and they are also subject to serious discrimination, 
against which Bulgarian society as a whole and its institutions 
do not fight. Thus, I think that each party should think about 
this, and our party will certainly do so.

  [Text] The Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) 
[PD(FSN)] today issued a declaration which states, among other 
things, that together with the entire Romanian public opinion, 
the members of that political party who participated in the 1989 
December revolution express their resolute protest and condemn 
with all the strength lent to them by their faith in the values 
of liberty and democracy the slanderous assertions by Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor [senator and chairman of the Greater Romania Party 
-- PRM], combined with a language lacking any trace of decency, 
and addressed to the persons who, by their exemplary courage and 
spirit of sacrifice, defying death, fought to remove the 
totalitarian communist regime and to forge a new destiny for the 
Romanian nation. 
  The PD(FSN) declaration continues by saying: With 
indignation we reject the diversion with respect to the 
so-called plot for the toppling by use of force of the current 
regime, President Ion Iliescu, and the installing of King Mihai 
before 17 June 1994. Mr. Ion Iliescu was among us during the 
revolution, in the struggle fought for its victory, and, 
regardless of our political stances, which may vary, his merits 
cannot be denied, as no one can deny the legality and legitimacy 
of his having been elected as head of our state. 
  The declaration in conclusion requests that the Romanian 
Senate withdraw parliamentary status both from Corneliu Vadim 
Tudor and, quote, from all people who, by their deeds, promote 
views that are particularly dangerous for the country, the 
law-governed state, and the opus of national reconstruction, 
unquote. The declaration is signed by the PD(FSN) Steering 
Collegium.

  [Excerpts] [Announcer] At this time President of the 
Republic Arpad Goncz is giving a news conference in the 
parliament house in Budapest to announce the date of the 
inaugural session of the new National Assembly. Over now to the 
parliament building: 
  [Correspondent Forro] Good morning. This is Evelin Forro, 
reporting from parliament. The president of the Republic has 
now taken his seat and you can now hear his announcement: 
  [Goncz] My dear friends: This meeting will not be very 
exciting. I will announce a few things which will obviously not 
surprise you. 
  Today I held discussions with Gyula Horn [chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] and then with the chairmen of 
the parliamentary parties. The topic of the discussions was the 
preparation of the inaugural session of the National Assembly. 
The expected date of the inaugural session is 28 June 1994. 
Its task, the task of the inaugural session, will be to examine 
the mandates, to elect officials, to determine the order of 
sessions, and to elect members of the standing committees. 
  At the inaugural session I intend to announce my proposal 
for 
prime minister, Gyula Horn. So what you are hearing now is not 
an official announcement, and the reason for this is very 
simple: Until the inaugural session the country still has a 
government. After the inaugural session the present government 
will transform itself into a caretaker government. That is the 
natural time when I must announce my recommendation for the post 
of prime minister. 
  I have asked Gyula Horn whether he will accept my nomination 
and he has replied in the affirmative. 
  The issues that must be decided at the inaugural session 
require preparation, political and professional coordinating 
discussions between the parliamentary parties. These 
coordinating discussions will begin on 9 June. 
  Obviously, the order of importance will be determined -- 
incidentally, I will not interfere in this -- by the fact that 
the decision about the functions is to a certain extent also 
contingent on the coalition discussions. Discussion of the 
practical issues, of procedural issues, at the level of experts 
can, (?in my view), begin even earlier. There is a huge number 
of tiny practical tasks that will have to be performed by 28 
June. 
  It was about these things that we conferred with the party 
chairmen, and at the same time I asked them to inform me about 
the results of their talks at their....[pauses] at our 
discussion 20 June 1994. 
  I would also like to inform you that this week I will 
conduct 
one-on-one discussions with the chairmen of the parliamentary 
parties, taking them nicely one by one so that I might hear 
their opinions about the country's economic and political 
situation. Perhaps it will interest you to know that we will 
begin with the smaller parties and proceed upwards, so 
that....[sentence incomplete as heard] 
  [Forro] [passage omitted] After meeting with Gyula Horn, the 
president received the leaders of the parliamentary parties 
together. In addition to Gyula Horn there were Ivan Peto, 
chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats; Laszlo Surjan, 
chairman of the Christian Democratic People's Party; and Jozsef 
Torgyan, chairman of the Independent Smallholders' Party. Peter 
Boross, the outgoing prime minister, represented the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum instead of [party Chairman] Lajos Fur. Viktor 
Orban, chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 
is in the hospital having a knee operation. Laszlo Kover, head 
of Fidesz's parliamentary group, represented him. [passage 
omitted] 
  Arpad Goncz said he wants a stable and balanced government 
which is capable of functioning and which is based on a broad 
consensus. I asked the president on behalf of Hungarian Radio 
how he will be able to cooperate with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, 
the probable prime minister. Arpad Goncz said: I hope we can 
cooperate well since we have known each other for a long time.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by </F>
Antonia Vymazalova and Milan Rusko; place and date not given: 
"Lest We Become a Dumping Site"] 
  [Text] A new regime is being introduced on the 
Slovak-Czech borders as of today. We spoke with Slovak Republic 
Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner about the changes and their 
consequences. 
  [PRAVDA] Sir, what does this measure mean in practice? 
  [Pittner] As of 18 May, we started conducting passport 
controls on all of the 15 road border crossings that have been 
guarded by the Czech Republic so far. We are going to engage 
several hundred people to conduct checks at these border 
crossings. We still have to solve a problem with seven railway 
border crossings. For this to occur, however, we need to append 
an appropriate supplement to the treaty between the Czech 
Republic and the Slovak Republic on passport and customs control 
of people transiting these border crossings so that the 
Immigration Police--that is, an armed force--is permitted to 
enter the territory of the other country when the train transits 
from the Czech Republic to the Slovak Republic, or in the 
opposite direction. 
  [PRAVDA] Will this affect our people? 
  [Pittner] No, they will still be permitted to travel with 
the documents provided for in the existing treaty. The 
objective is to accelerate clearance at the border crossings. 
By conducting controls on our territory, we will have the 
opportunity to learn about third country nationals and take 
legal measures against illegal immigration. 
  [PRAVDA] What will be required from your people? 
  [Pittner] We had to begin relocating police officers from 
other border crossings than those with the Czech Republic. We 
are retraining them while gradually complementing our personnel 
by several hundreds of police officers. This also means an 
increase in funds needed to perform the service. Some 80 
million korunas will be involved. 
  [PRAVDA] Why has the Slovak side adopted this regime now? 
The previous government had objections against enforcing such a 
regime. 
  [Pittner] Their objections were probably based on the fact 
that they wanted the borders to be perceived liberally after two 
independent states were established. Until the last moment, 
they tried to stress this liberal situation at the border 
crossings. The problem lies somewhere else, however. 
  Slovakia, the Czech Republic, and all of Central and East 
Europe have become a transit area for people immigrating through 
our territory from East Europe, the former Soviet Union, as well 
as India, China, and Pakistan, and desiring to enter Western 
countries, particularly the Federal Republic of Germany. This 
is why the German side was interested in signing the readmission 
treaty between Germany and the Czech Republic. On the basis of 
this treaty, the Czech Republic is obliged to readmit the 
refugees who made it to Germany from the Czech Republic. The 
German police are very strict and efficient in this respect. 
The Czech police, of course, used to transport those people 
back to Slovakia because they tried to prove that, on their 
immigration route, the refugees had entered the Czech Republic 
from Slovakia and, from there, Germany. Because we did not guard 
our borders, it was difficult to prove that they did not come to 
the Czech Republic from Slovakia. Therefore, we became a 
dumping site, collecting also those returned migrants who 
possibly had not entered the Czech Republic from Slovakia at all. 
  On the one hand, the former government, in an effort to show 
the people that it did not have this strict idea of guarding the 
borders, stressed a kind of liberal attitude toward the borders. 
On the other hand, because our borders had not been guarded, we 
could not prevent so-called illegals--that is, third country 
nationals who do not have a residence permit in our 
country--from moving around here. 
  [PRAVDA] In a German journal, there was an article recently 
on immigrants in Europe, saying that 26,000 official 
applications for asylum have been submitted in Slovakia and that 
50,000-100,000 people with expired visas or no visas at all are 
present illegally on the territory of our Republic. How do you 
view this situation? 
  [Pittner] The director of the Immigration Police gave me 
information that, in Slovakia, we have some 18,000 legal 
foreigners who are legally registered here and whose presence 
here was legally extended for various reasons. However, even 
more serious is the fact that there are 10,000-20,000 foreigners 
who are here illegally; this information was provided not by the 
Immigration Police but by other services. They are probably 
here temporarily. It is likely that they are waiting for the 
right time to move to Western countries. However, we also have 
information that they are here because of organized crime, for 
which they perform specific services--for example, car thefts, 
drug-trafficking, or violent crimes that are seemingly 
inexplicable. I mean, murders without a familiar motive, 
threats, extortion, etc. 
  [PRAVDA] How can the police intervene with people whose 
residence has not been legalized? 
  [Pittner] The police are in a very difficult situation. 
Immigrants from Pakistan, India, Southeast Asia, and also former 
Yugoslavia destroy their personal documents before entering this 
country. We get needed information only by interrogating them, 
and we proceed depending on the countries with which we have 
concluded treaties for readmission of these refugees. 
  [PRAVDA] With which countries do we have treaties? 
  [Pittner] We have treaties with Ukraine, Romania, Hungary, 
and the Czech Republic. The problem is that, until recently, we 
could return only Romanian citizens to Romania, but not third 
country nationals. Now, we are trying to amend the treaty in 
that respect. 
  So far, we have not succeed in concluding a treaty on the 
readmission of third country nationals with Hungary, not even a 
treaty that would allow us to deport such people by road or 
railway transportation, at our own expense, trough Hungarian 
territory to the country of their destination. Recently, 
however, I have received unofficial information that the 
Hungarian side is willing to sign such a treaty on the 
readmission of people to third countries with us. 
  [PRAVDA] The asylum law is closely related to immigration 
problems. In Switzerland, they adopted a law in March according 
to which they can put illegal migrants in jail for up to three 
months if they are unable to prove their identity--if they do 
not have their documents. A stricter asylum law is in force in 
Germany, France, and other democratic states. Are we, too, 
considering adopting a law on the same principles? 
  [Pittner] In view of the enormous number of the laws that we 
consider exceptionally important, the government does not 
anticipate that such a law would be included in the plan of 
legislative tasks for the time being. When conversing with 
ambassadors from Western countries, we draw their attention to 
the fact that, if the Western countries do not change their 
attitude toward Russia, Ukraine, and postcommunist countries, in 
general, even the strictest laws and measures may fail to 
prevent possible mass immigration to the West of people 
dissatisfied with the economic situation. I mean, after the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact and the entire former Soviet 
bloc, the West stopped spending huge sums on armament and 
defense programs but is not sufficiently active in supporting 
these countries with some kind of Marshall Plan. Economic 
tension can lead, in some countries, to an existential crisis 
and even to the possibility of civil war. In such a case, no 
police corps would be able to stop this immigration. 
  [PRAVDA] You mentioned that there are 10,000-20,000 illegal 
immigrants in our country. Do we know where they are, what they 
are doing....? 
  [Pittner] We do not have the kind of control that was normal 
under the former regime because many laws have been abolished 
and there is no registration duty--that is, no registration with 
the police. Even if such laws did exist, the control mechanisms 
that existed under the former regime have ceased to exist, and 
it is difficult to imagine that the record could be kept in this 
way. The police have no right to enter apartments if there is 
no well-founded suspicion that crime is being committed there. 
However, if someone is suspected of committing a crime, it is 
possible to shadow such people using available means, and, after 
verification, launch criminal proceedings. However, the police 
have lost--thank God!--certain tools they used to have under the 
former regime. I believe, however, that this problem is not to 
be solved by repressive bodies; rather, there should be a 
worldwide solution to this problem. I do not believe we should 
use repression but that we should eliminate the reasons for such 
immigration.

<F P=106> [Unattributed "special report": "What Klaus Actually Said </F>
on NOVA Television"] 
  [Text] On Monday 30 May, NOVA Television recorded its 
regular "Why?" program, whose guest was Prime Minister V. Klaus. 
As we have reported, NOVA announced via CTK that it would not 
broadcast the program with Klaus due to a "technical error." In 
fact, this was not due to a "technical error" but because Klaus 
reacted acrimoniously to some of the questions from L. Beniak, 
and the program, according to RUDE PRAVO's information, was not 
aired at the request of the prime minister. The RUDE PRAVO 
editorial office has managed to obtain a recording of the 
program and, in view of the fact that the whole issue has 
meanwhile become politicized, it considers it necessary to 
fulfill its obligation to keep the public informed and to 
disclose some of the prime minister's replies. The NOVA 
management was still insisting yesterday evening, under the 
threat of legal action, that RUDE PRAVO not publish anything 
from the recording. We are publishing some excerpts that 
document the course of the interview. 
  [Beniak] I asked my friends abroad to send me all of the 
newspaper clippings possible in which they write about you. I 
found a couple of characteristic features in them: He has the 
talent to say terrible things in the most amiable way; he has an 
unfortunate aptitude for making enemies of people who support 
his policy; and he does not suffer in silence when he has to 
deal with people whom he regards as fools, including reporters. 
And, there are adjectives such as "virulent," "gruff," 
"hurtful," "contemptuous," "aggressive," and "arrogant." What 
affect does this have on you when they write that you are 
arrogant? Do you let it pass, or does it annoy you or bother 
you? Do you have the nasty feeling that someone does not 
understand you? 
  [Klaus] I think these are only some of the clippings. I 
think we could bring in completely different clippings. That 
was one tendency in these clippings, and it has become a 
definite cliche. I think that, when a reporter does not know 
what to write, does not know what to say, has no arguments, and 
so on, he resorts to these facile and unidirectional judgments, 
when it is not the substance but something superficial that is 
being assessed, and I really disagree with this. I do not 
believe that this is true. 
  [Beniak] Nevertheless, you are perhaps the only politician, 
or the only politician accessible to us, who, for instance, does 
not forgive reporters if they do not ask a question properly. 
You are certainly the only one. You immediately feel the need 
to point out that it is imprecise. Others react, let us say, 
politely, let it pass, and then answer. 
  [Klaus] We each have some proclivity. I have to admit that 
sometimes I chose this one, sometimes another. That I always 
correct reporters if it seems to me that the question is wrong, 
again I have to say that it would appear otherwise; this is 
simply not true. I repeat and I insist that sometimes a person 
chooses one technique and strategy and sometimes another. 
  [Beniak] Karel Hvizdala, when he wrote a book with you in 
1992 called First Report, reminded you that, in reply 
to a question on what you consider to be your weakness, you once 
said: a lack of credence in opinions held by someone else. You 
said this on 4 April 1990 in an interview that I recorded with 
you and that you authorized. Do you think this was, shall we 
say, a slip of the tongue...? 
  [Klaus] Of course, I cannot, over four years, remember every 
single word that I said. I certainly could not have meant this, 
I could not have said.... I said that there may be a tendency 
toward this, or that there may be in this respect, if I were to 
measure it on scales, then I would say in a ratio of 51:49, that 
there may be a certain problem. However, there is no question 
that this would be an absolute judgment, and I simply do not 
think it is. 
  [Beniak] Sometimes you definitely encounter manifestations 
of antagonism--let us say, you are asked questions to which you 
reply that their resolution is not within your jurisdiction. 
Typical questions: Will you increase the price of something 
else? I mean the kind of antagonism in PRACE, for example, when 
it published an interview composed of questions readers had sent 
to the editorial office--it was very noticeable there. What 
affect does this have on you? 
  [Klaus] You are choosing only negative questions, and now 
you are forcing me to go on the defensive. I will not accept 
them, Mr. Editor. I do not accept this. The world is not like 
this, not at all like this. It is quite different. Another 
motif prevails absolutely. I will not accept these questions. 
I do not accept them; do not be angry with me. I do not accept 
them. Why do you not speak about other issues? Why do you 
choose one random interview? Why do you interpret this 
interview in this way? The world is simply not like this. It 
is not a view of the world that I accept exists like this. 
  [Beniak] I am unable, in the course of 20 minutes, to ask 
questions from which it is possible to put together... 
  [Klaus] You are the one who is asking that we do something 
like this... I am not desirous of it. 
  [Beniak] I have spent several days reading your interviews 
and books... 
  [Klaus] Something else is paramount, right? 
  [Beniak] I am trying to ask questions that you are not 
normally asked or that you evidently do not like to answer... 
  [Klaus] They are asked constantly, these questions. If the 
day before yesterday I had a one-hour interview on Radio 
Frekvence 1, the questions were about nothing other than this. 
I simply do not understand where these questions can lead, how 
it is possible to answer them. I cannot imagine this at all. 
  [Beniak] I am saying--and you know this from sports--that a 
person reveals himself most when he is under pressure, when he 
has to respond to something that is unpleasant for him. 
  [Klaus] Then, the only possibility is if he accepts this 
pressure, if this pressure is fair, if this pressure is correct 
or incorrect. 
  [Beniak] Do you think my questions are unfair? 
  [Klaus] No; the issue does not involve fairness. I am 
surprised by their selection, by their range. I do not 
understand where it can lead and where it is leading. You had 
better ask; this is probably a waste of time for your viewers. 
  [Beniak] What kind of leader of the opposition would you be? 
  [Klaus] What kind of question is that? What do you want to 
say? If we are ever in opposition, then, undoubtedly, we will 
act somehow. 
  [Beniak] What kind of opposition would it be--good, bad? 
  [Klaus] What could the answer possibly be to that question, 
an answer that would satisfy you a little, at least a little? I 
could now start asking you questions and you would be under 
pressure. It does not seem to me that these questions add 
anything; they lead to an opening being created for something, 
they lead to a possible answer, they lead to a situation in 
which a person could somehow reveal something that is not known 
about him. I do not believe this, I simply....

    [Editorial Report] The following items on developments in 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were drawn from recent Serb 
and Montenegrin periodicals. 
<H5>  Banks Having Liquidity Problems </H5>
  The 5 May issue of the Belgrade daily POLITIKA reported that 
13 banks had negative balances in their "giro" (non-savings) 
accounts during the first few days of May. That banks are having 
problems with liquidity is nothing new, POLITIKA said, but up to 
now "only" five to seven banks operated in the red on any given 
day. Bankers are not concealing their lack of liquidity, the 
paper observed, adding that the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
[NBJ] had threatened to block Investbanka's giro account 
completely because of Investbanka's shortage of dinars if it did 
not sell the NBJ foreign currency. Investbanka settled its debt 
with the central bank and continued to work undisturbed, 
POLITIKA noted. 
  The daily reported liquidity problems of the following 
banks: 
  -- At Beobanka, the largest Serbian bank, deposits decreased 
by 20,000 dinars, and the bank did not have enough money on 4 
May to conduct all of its transactions. A Beobanka official 
explained to POLITIKA that the money shortage is most likely due 
to the fact that salaries paid out by enterprises just before 
the l May holiday "had not yet returned to the money channels." 
  -- Jugobanka also had problems with liquidity but covered 
its 
negative balance by selling foreign currency to the National 
Bank. 
  -- The JIK bank had a negative balance for only one day. The 
bank's spokesperson said that the bank had enough cash to make 
all the payments to its customers but does not have enough money 
in the giro account for all its credit activities. 
  -- "One of the most stable banks," the Vojvodjanska Bank, 
had 
a negative balance on 4 May. POLITIKA learned that this was due 
to the bank's payment of pensions. This resulted in the bank's 
halting the issuance of credits to businesses. 
  -- The vice governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia 
maintained that the situation is not as bleak as it looks and 
that, of the 13 banks which had a negative balance on 4 May, 
three banks--Vojvodjanska, Panonska, and Novosadska--"accounted 
for 95 percent of the shortage." 
<H5>  Belgrade Construction Firm Operating in Russia </H5>
  Miroslav Subotic, president of the Belgrade construction 
company Komgrap, said in an interview in the 20 April Belgrade 
daily VECERNJE NOVOSTI that his firm continues to work on 
building sites in Russia, where 600 of its engineers, 
technicians, and laborers are employed. He noted that one 
advantage of a construction company is that it can work under 
"someone else's name." Subotic revealed plans to sign such a 
contract under "someone else's name" for an additional 1,000 
Yugoslav workers, pointing out that the firm enjoys a 
competitive advantage by already having construction sites and 
equipment worth "tens of thousands of dollars" in Russia. 
  Subotic noted that as a result of the UN-imposed sanctions 
on 
Serbia and Montenegro more than $10 million due the firm for 
projects it had completed in England, Austria, Libya, Angola, 
and Russia have been frozen abroad. "We were able to recover 
some of the money with the help of Centrokop, which was given 
permission by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to import 
foodstuffs." 
<H5>  Irregularities in Podgorica Aluminum Combine </H5>
  A "Commission for Monitoring the Work Process," established 
by the workers' council of the Podgorica Aluminum Combine, has 
issued a report alleging "numerous irregularities" in one of the 
largest collectives in Montenegro. The 20 May issue of the 
Podgorica weekly MONITOR reported that the commission has 
established that about 10,000 metric tons of aluminum worth over 
$12 million are unaccounted for. The commission obtained this 
figure, MONITOR said, by comparing the total annual production 
of 38,000 tons claimed by the combine's management with data in 
the combine's annual balance sheet. The commission also 
determined that large quantitites of equipment and other 
inventory are missing. 
  According to MONITOR "sources," the Aluminum Combine's 
general director, Danilo Vuksanovic, is awaiting appointment to 
another position, and "it is intended to conceal the entire 
issue from the public." The commission has turned over its 
findings to "relevant state authorities" for further 
investigation, MONITOR stated, adding that the commission had 
also found irregularities in the Podgorica firm's foreign 
currency business transactions and in the declared value of 
aluminum in the Zetatrans, Mosor, and Port of Bar warehouses. 
Based on the firm's business operations report, the warehoused 
aluminum is worth $1 per ton, while the world price of one ton 
of aluminum is about $1,100, MONITOR reported. 
<H5>  Polemic Between Patriarch Pavle, Bishop Artemije </H5>
  The 21-22 May issue of the Belgrade daily BORBA reports that 
a polemic largely unnoticed by the popular media has broken out 
in the pages of SVETI LAZAR, the journal of the Raska-Prizren 
eparchy, between the bishop of that region, Artemije, and 
Patriarch Pavle. The polemic was started, said BORBA, by Bishop 
Artemije's criticism of a sermon by Patriarch Pavle, in which 
the patriarch reportedly declared that Serbs, Croats, and 
Muslims had been suffering equally in Bosnia-Herzegovina and all 
needed peace because "we are all God's children." Bishop 
Artemije categorized the patriarch's position as "untenable from 
the Orthodox point of view." In response, Patriarch Pavle 
declared that he would "leave to people of goodwill and to 
all-knowing and all-seeing God to judge whatever I do." 
  According to the BORBA account, Bishop Artemije, "who is 
viewed as one of the most radical people in the Orthodox Church, 
answered without hesitation" in the next issue of SVETI LAZAR 
that similar statements could increasingly be heard from 
religious figures whose only intent was to give the impression 
of being "broadminded" and "democratic." In defense of his 
position, Artemije cited an 11 February 1950 letter written by 
Bishop Nikolaj Velimirovic "in response to similar positions 
which existed after World War II." In that letter, Bishop 
Nikolaj wrote that he often had to "correct my priests when they 
said to the people--God is the father of all the people. This is 
not so. God is the creator of all the people, but God is the 
father only of those people who believe in the Son of God and 
the concept of sonship.... This difference between Christians 
and non-Christians should especially be emphasized in the 
present era of vulgar propaganda that all religions are the 
same...." It was in this context, Bishop Artemije concluded, 
that Patriarch Pavle's statement that "we are all God's 
children" was untenable from the Orthodox perspective. 
  Patriarch Pavle, answering Bishop Artemije in a subsequent 
issue of SVETI LAZAR, cited passages from the Old and New 
Testaments to support his view that all people are "sons of God 
and brothers." Stating that it would be up to the people and God 
to judge the reasons for his empathy with the suffering of the 
peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina--"especially those who are the 
most powerless and most innocent, not only among the Serbs, but 
also among the Croats and Muslims"--he added that he was trying 
to make his believers understand that in the end "God will judge 
us by how we behaved and acted toward our weaker brothers."

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F>
Renaud Girard in Paris; date not given: "Silajdzic: `Europe 
Scorns Our Right To Legitimate Defense'"] 
  [Text]Haris Silajdzic is an energetic man in his 
forties, with simple and direct ways who speaks excellent 
English. Just as much at ease in an international forum as he 
is on the streets of Sarajevo, he embodies the new generation of 
staunchly European Bosnian politicians. He was appointed prime 
minister last fall from the post of foreign minister, and since 
then has constantly demanded that Europe respect its commitments 
toward the aggressed Bosnia. Passing through Paris, he held a 
long meeting late on Friday afternoon [3 June] with Alain Juppe 
at the Foreign Ministry, then with President Mitterrand at the 
Elysee. 
  [Girard] In your opinion, what is required for there to be a 
long-lasting cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Silajdzic] We want Serbian troops to withdraw completely 
from the Gorazde safe area, as the United Nations and NATO have 
requested. Only then can we start negotiations on putting a 
stop to the hostilities. 
  [Girard] Do you think that your troops have any chance of 
cutting off the Brcko corridor? (linking Serbia with the areas 
of western Bosnia and Croatia that have been conquered by the 
Serbs.) 
  [Silajdzic] We are not concerned today with cutting any 
corridors, but rather with obtaining a real cease-fire that will 
enable us to begin negotiations. To be able to talk, there must 
first be an atmosphere of peace. The problem with the 
negotiations we have had in the past with the Serbs is that they 
were held in an atmosphere of constant attacks on our towns by 
Belgrade's forces. 
  [Girard] But the Bosnians are no longer on the defensive. 
You now have a real army which the Serbs, who are good gunners 
but bad infantrymen, are increasingly afraid of. Why do you not 
seize on this advantage? 
  [Silajdzic] I trust you are not being serious! Your question 
implies that the aggressors, who have ravaged half the country, 
destroyed our towns, killed so many civilians, opened 
concentration camps, and systematically raped, have now become 
the victims. The facts speak for themselves. Serbia is the 
aggressor. The Serbian infantry is armed to the teeth, backed 
up by tanks, artillery, and ground-to-ground missiles and 
anti-aircraft guns -- all weapons that we do not have. There is 
no offensive in Brcko or Bosnia. There is fighting, to resist 
aggression. Our resistance cannot be described as an offensive. 
  [Girard] What are your conditions for a political solution 
to 
the conflict? 
  [Silajdzic] First, that the areas where genocide has taken 
place, that have seen ethnic cleansing, are not handed over to 
the perpetrators of these crimes. The Serbian militia that have 
invaded these areas must return home and their leaders, who 
orchestrated the ethnic cleansing operations, should be tried 
and sentenced as war criminals by an international tribunal. 
  [Girard] There was a war crimes tribunal in Nuremberg 
because 
there were victors capable of setting one up. However, in the 
current situation, how can we practically reconcile political 
settlements and a war tribunal? 
  [Silajdzic] I do not accept the equation that justice equals 
strength. If you say that we can only see that justice is done 
if we are victorious, then it is a return to the stone age. We 
want to obtain both the political settlement of the conflict and 
the setting up of a war court. Innocent people have been 
killed: There must be a court. These days, when you kill a 
man, you are put in prison or you are sentenced to death by 
lethal injection, like in the United States. If you kill a 
dozen people, you are called a "serial killer" and you are sent 
to a psychiatric prison. If you kill 200,000 people, you are 
cordially invited to Geneva... 
  [Girard] Where the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
concerned, what percentage have you demanded for the 
Croatian-Muslim federation and what percentage of the occupied 
territory would you agree to leave to the Serbs? 
  [Silajdzic] Which Serbs are you talking about? We believe 
that those who orchestrated this fascist project for a greater 
Serbia, based on ethnic cleansing, are a small minority of the 
Serbian people. 
  Most Serbs have left the country because they do not approve 
of this criminal policy. We still have with us some 200,000 
Serbs, loyal to their country, Bosnia, and to its government. 
If the Serbs want to live separately and among themselves -- 
inside the sovereign state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course -- 
then they may do so, but only in those areas where they were in 
the majority before the conflict began. 
  [Girard] Which means what percentage? 
  [Silajdzic] We are not talking in terms of percentages here, 
we are talking about a principle. For example, the federation 
we have founded with the Croats does not include a single 
village which had a majority of Serbs before the war. For their 
part, the Serbs occupy many towns that did not have a Serbian 
majority, but they want to acquire these regions for themselves. 
We will not accept that. 
  [Girard] I note that you are not opposed to areas where the 
Serbs could live among themselves. What percentage of the 
country does that represent? 
  [Silajdzic] We said that before the war, 58 percent of the 
country was inhabited by a Bosnian or Croatian majority or quite 
simply by Bosnians. The problem is that any idea of division or 
partition is itself a criminal idea because, in my country, 
people were living together, and not just in the same town, but 
in the same street, the same building, the same house, and often 
sharing the same bed. How can you divide that up? What do you 
do with the children of mixed couples, who are neither Serbs, 
Croats, or Bosnians? To my eyes, dividing people up like that 
is a crime in itself. That is why we disagree with certain 
Western governments, since they would let this happen. 
  [Girard] How? 
  [Silajdzic] By giving practically carte blanche to the 
fascist regime in Belgrade to kill and hunt defenseless people. 
We can respect a decision of non-intervention, or even of 
strict neutrality. But there is no longer any neutrality when 
we are prevented from arming and defending ourselves, and if a 
blind eye is turned while the Belgrade regime conquers all the 
land it wants. Now the Serbs are claiming that the status quo 
should be maintained, and many Western governments are ready to 
give in to them. Some even say to us: If you do not accept the 
peace plan, we will withdraw our blue helmets! Europe is 
scorning our right to legitimate defense. 
  [Girard] What is the situation with your alliance with the 
Croats? 
  [Silajdzic] We have lived with the Croats for centuries. Of 
course, we are two separate regions, but we share the same 
culture and the same literature. 
  Why did we fight against the Croats in 1993? After the 
Serbian aggression of April 1992, everyone began to fight to 
survive. It is true that one of the Serbs' greatest 
achievements was to provoke this fratricidal struggle between 
Croats and Bosnians. Now, we enjoy good relations with Croatia 
and, on this issue at least, I am optimistic about the future.

<F P=106> [Article by Ewa Kaszuba and Kazimierz Groblewski: "Who Will </F>
Back Walesa, What Chances Does He Have? He Would Lose Today, 
but..."] 
  [Text] If the elections were held today, Lech Walesa would 
not win them. On this point, the politicians of the government 
coalitions and the opposition fully agree. However, the 
elections will be held in over a year, and a lot may happen, 
they say. 
  According to them, whether or not Walesa will have greater 
chances at that time than he does today depends on how he 
fulfills his official duties during this last period. 
  Our interlocutors, both the members of the coalition and of 
the opposition, predict that the presidential elections will not 
yield final results in the first round, and another round will 
be indispensable. In line with the Constitution, the second 
round will be held if in the first round none of the candidates 
obtains more than half of all of the votes cast. It would be a 
competition between two persons with the largest numbers of 
votes. 
  Today it is still not known how many candidates will 
represent the "Solidarity side." Henryk Wujec of the Freedom 
Union [UW] told us that his party will certainly field its own 
candidate and will certainly not back Walesa in the first round. 
Thus, it looks like, apart from Walesa, at least one more 
Solidarity candidate will run in the first round. If the right 
wing neither backs Walesa nor agrees on a joint candidate with 
UW, there will be several candidates. 
  Politicians predict that in this situation Walesa may have 
great difficulties passing to the second round. If he does 
manage to do so, his chances in the second round will increase. 
In that round, he will probably meet with a candidate of the 
Polish Peasant Party [PSL] or the Democratic Left Alliance 
[SLD]. In such a case, he may receive the support of 
postsolidarity groupings. 
  Therefore, it looks like Walesa's chances to reach the 
second 
round will be largely decided by the first round. Today, only 
the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR] declares that it 
will support him. It is important how Solidarity behaves; the 
way it acts will be followed by some of the rightist groupings. 
The rating of Walesa in the union is rather low today. There 
are rumors that the union may field its own candidate (the name 
of Marian Krzaklewski is mentioned, even though he announced 
several months ago that he would not run). It seems highly 
unlikely that Walesa will be backed by one of the rightist 
coalitions: Alliance for Poland [Przymierze dla Polski] 
(Christian-National Union--ZChN, Center Accord--PC, Conservative 
Coalition, Peasant Accord--PL, and Movement for the 
Republic--RdR), or the alliance of the Union for Real 
Politics--UPR, Christian-Peasant Party--SLCh, Party of Christian 
Democrats--PChD, National Party--SN, and Conservative Party--PK. 
It seems relatively most probable that Walesa might be backed 
by the RdR and the PL from one coalition and by athe SLCh from 
the other. 
  However, both within Solidarity and in the rightist parties, 
there may be attempts at internal "pro-Walesa" coup d'etats 
before the presidential elections. It is most likely that a 
pro-Walesa policy will be adopted by the ZChN, and least likely 
that such a policy will be pursued by the PC. 
  "It is not for the first time that President Walesa is 
showing that he is a courageous man who is not afraid of taking 
risks," believes Tomasz Nalecz of the Labor Union. However, 
because he has antagonized many milieus (not keeping promises, 
acting disloyally to aides, shifting of responsibility to 
others, refusing to take on responsibility), it is difficult to 
predict who might form an alliance with him. He believes that 
Walesa might be seriously threatened only by a politician who 
would guarantee to fulfill the fundamental role that should 
today be fulfilled by the Polish president--the role of an 
arbiter. 
  "Unfortunately, Lech Walesa resembles... 
<H5>  A Child in a Sand Pit </H5>
  ...who merely keeps throwing sand at his mates' eyes, 
causing 
conflicts and tensions. We need a peacemaking person, someone 
who would ease tensions. If a grouping or a nonparty group 
manages to find a generally respected person with an impeccable 
past, a person who would defend his stance, it will place Lech 
Walesa in a dead position," Nalecz says. 
  Two politicians of the governing coalition, the SLD's 
Zbigniew Siemiatkowski and the PSL's Jan Bury, both agree that, 
if the presidential elections were held in a few days, Walesa 
would have slim chances of even getting to the second round. 
According to Bury, these chances will increase in a year's 
time; according to Siemiatkowski, "a lot may happen." 
  "The president will at any price want to... 
<H5>  Stand at the Lead of the Disgruntled </H5>
  Therefore, what should be expected are bows in the direction 
of Solidarity, which is emerging as the main oppositional force 
and the advocate of the way of thinking favoring demands. The 
president will probably make himself heard again when the 
enterprise tax on above-normative pays (popiwek) and the next 
budget are discussed; he will try to present himself as the 
defender of the prosocial policy. Another element of the 
campaign, which is becoming increasingly clear today, are the 
slogans of calling certain people to account, combating crime, 
and corruption. Walesa will want to persuade the people that he 
is the only one who has clean hands, claims Siemiatkowski. He 
does not exclude the possibility of dramatic personnel changes 
in the entourage of the president. 
  The president's decision did not come as a surprise to Jan 
Bury. After the parliamentary elections, it became clear that 
Walesa was the only person... 
<H5>  Able To Attract </H5>
  ...to himself the scattered postsolidarity groupings, 
despite 
all of the differences. Because, as he predicts, the first 
round of the elections will not be final and in the second round 
Walesa will compete most probably with a candidate of the left, 
the forces of the Solidarity origin will not have much choice 
and will back him. The church will not have much choice, 
either. Because the president is known for his ability to 
surprise everyone, Bury expects that, during the campaign, he 
will submit so many new proposals that one of them will 
certainly be catchy enough. He will be able to criticize any of 
his countercandidates for not keeping promises. 
  Such criticism is also expected by Siemiatkowski, who claims 
that we will have a black presidential campaign. This is why 
serious candidates are not hurrying to make their intentions 
known. 
  "Even the best candidate will not endure a full year and a 
half of slander. He will wear out." He believes that the real 
candidates will be known only next spring. 
  "The Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN] will 
almost certainly field its own candidate. Most probably, it 
will be me," says KPN head Leszek Moczulski. He adds, however, 
that an official decision has not yet been made. Moczulski 
allows for the hypothetical possibility that the KPN would not 
field its own candidate but would back Walesa--in a situation 
when there would be fears that the second round might turn out 
to be victorious for the candidate of the left. 
  "If the elections were held today, Pawlak would have the 
greatest chance," Moczulski believes. If he met with Walesa in 
the second round, he would win. However, today Walesa might 
have trouble... 
<H5>  Reaching the Second Round </H5>
  However, we have so much time before the elections that 
discussing them is like talking about the hair color of a child 
that is to be born in a year and a half. 
  "I personally think it is rather unlikely, if not 
impossible, 
that our coalition and my grouping will support Walesa," says 
Stanislaw Michalkiewicz of UPR, a party that makes up the 
alliance along with the SLCh, the PChD, the PK, and the SN. The 
issue has not been discussed yet. "I evaluate Lech Walesa's 
presidency as a presidency of unused chances. For us to support 
him, something would have to happen that I cannot even imagine 
right now." 
  Michalkiewicz believes that most of the people who supported 
Lech Walesa in 1990 are his firm opponents today. 
<H5>  "I Cannot Really See... </H5>
  ...anyone who would vote for him." According to him, if 
Walesa gained any new supporters during his presidency, there 
were not many of them, a fact that was proved by the electoral 
result of the BBWR (in the last parliamentary elections, the 
BBWR was backed by approximately 700,000 people--editor's note). 
  "Walesa's chances are slim; however, they exist. All of this 
depends to a great extent on the further course of his 
presidency," says UW's Henryk Wujec. "I do not think that the 
new president will be known in the first round; the second round 
will be decisive. It depends on who will reach it. He has 
enhanced his chances by submitting his candidacy already. His 
potential supporters may be already grouping around him. He 
would not win the elections today, but, in a year's time... 
<H5>  Things May Look Different </H5>
  Walesa has a permanent group of supporters, which, I 
believe, 
is approximately 20-25 percent of the voters. It is a fairly 
large group, but it is certainly too small to ensure him a 
positive result. Today it does not look like any of the serious 
postsolidarity groupings would be willing to back him. UW will 
certainly not support him because it will field its own 
candidate. I still do not know who it will be. I also think 
that, if both our candidate and Walesa reach the second round, 
many UW supporters will not back him because they are 
disappointed with his presidency." 
  On 4 June, before his departure to Normandy, Lech Walesa was 
asked to comment on the public opinion research, showing that 
his popularity in on the wane. The president said that he is 
convinced that he will win next year's presidential elections. 
He believes that there is a chance to form a new "team." 
"There is only one condition--obey Walesa," he stated.

  [Text] Poland does not want to turn its back on the east 
and wants to maintain good relations with all of the countries 
that have emerged since the demise of the Soviet Union, Foreign 
Minister Andrzej Olechowski said at the opening of a two-day 
conference on Poland's eastern policy in Warsaw. Minister 
Olechowski emphasized that the building of democratic structures 
in the east is a lot more difficult and that delays in the 
process are inevitable. 
  When asked by journalists whether certain developments in 
the 
situation in Russia could constitute a danger to Poland, 
Minister Olechowski replied: 
  [begin Olechowski recording] From that direction--often say 
this--neo-imperialism, if it was stepped up; we do not 
overdramatize this in any way [sentence as heard]. We can also 
see very positive signals coming from that direction. One 
should mention, for example, Russia's role in the recent 
Ukrainian conflict or the role played in the internal Ukrainian 
difficulties. One could mention the Latvian-Lithuanian Treaty. 
We are awaiting a similar treaty for Estonia. It will be an 
important litmus test for us. 
  Chaos and further economic disintegration are certainly bad 
for us. If the situation were to deteriorate even further, it 
would obviously make our lives very difficult. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Edward Krzemien: "Olechowski Could Leave"] </F>
  [Text] It would take 10 minutes for the Council of 
Ministers to adopt a new statute of the Foreign Ministry [MSZ]. 
But, for six weeks now, the issue continues to be deleted from 
the agenda. The new statute is the first step in the reforms of 
the ministry proposed by Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  If the government does not adopt a new MSZ statute within 
two 
weeks, Minister Andrzej Olechowski could resign in protest, the 
minister's associates say. 
  The draft of the reform was prepared by Jerzy Kozminski, who 
has been brought into the MSZ by Olechowski to take the post of 
secretary of state. Kozminski was regarded as an excellent 
organizer and was Leszek Balcerowicz's closest aide in 1989-91 
and then an adviser to Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka. 
<H5>  To Wait Through Kozminski Stage </H5>
  After completing work on the reform, he was nominated 
Poland's ambassador to the United States and was supposed to 
leave for Washington as soon as the changes in the ministry took 
place, and, most importantly, only when an appropriate candidate 
had been found to replace him as the future secretary general, 
the second post in the MSZ after the minister. It seems that 
was precisely one of the reasons for procrastinating with the 
reform. The Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] decided to 
"wait through the Kozminski stage"--Kozminski cannot 
procrastinate too much in his departure for Washington--and only 
then to begin negotiations concerning the filling of the post. 
  In a desperate defense move, Olechowski decided that Jerzy 
Kozminski would retain for the moment the post of secretary of 
state apart from the ambassadorial post (according to diplomatic 
protocol experts, such things are practiced around the world). 
Such a solution gives Olechowski plenty of time for coming to 
an agreement with Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  Apart from Andrzej Wieczorkiewicz, the prime minister's 
adviser, Kozminski's place could be taken over by Marek Siwiec, 
who is being promoted by the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]. 
<H5>  Siwiec Worse Than Konarski </H5>
  However, according to our information, Pawlak does not like 
Siwiec's candidacy. Siwiec is politically associated with SLD 
leader Aleksander Kwasniewski, and he will not be very useful to 
URM. That is why the prime minister would prefer another SLD 
member, Sejm Deputy Wlodzimierz Konarski, who, by the way, is 
supported by part of the SLD leadership and who was mentioned 
earlier as the SLD's candidate for deputy foreign minister. 
  Konarski, a longstanding diplomat in Jaruzelski's and 
Rakowski's times, was a representative of the Polish People's 
Republic [PRL] in the CSCE during the martial law period. 
Skubiszewski's entry in 1989 ended his diplomatic career. In 
the Sejm of this term, he is one of the main forces behind the 
famous subcommission for personnel review in the MSZ, in which 
he cooperates with Tadeusz Samborski of the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL] (also a former MSZ man). Samborski is regarded by URM as 
the person who "incites" Pawlak against the MSZ and Olechowski. 
<H5>  Who Will Be Shot Down? </H5>
  The subcommission accuses Skubiszewski of 
"deprofessionalization" of the foreign service, meaning getting 
rid of PRL experts of the Konarski kind, and demands that the 
qualifications of all of the "new" ones be verified. 
  On 25 May, ZYCIE WARSZAWY revealed a letter from Tadeusz 
Iwinski of the SLD and Tadeusz Samborski of the PSL addressed to 
the director of the MSZ's personnel department, on behalf of the 
Sejm subcommission for MSZ personnel issues. The authors of the 
13 May letter demand "information on the qualifications, the 
course of professional career, and the fulfillment of 
requirements defined in specific provisions concerning 
diplomatic and consular service" regarding 23 persons, among 
them two deputy ministers, directors of key departments, and 
some ambassadors and consuls. 
  Neither Pawlak, who is chief of his party's parliamentary 
club, nor (which is strange) SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski 
has distanced himself from the list. Thus, it is beginning to 
function within the MSZ as a list of people whom the coalition 
wants to "shoot down." 
  This situation causes a feeling of insecurity and danger 
among the MSZ cadre. There are plenty of forecasts that a 
"crisis is approaching" and that an exodus of the best diplomats 
will begin. Every one of them will easily find a job in both 
Poland and in international institutions for salaries that would 
be several times higher. Salaries in the MSZ continue to be one 
of the lowest in the central administration, an official said. 
  In addition, neither the PSL nor the SLD has any personnel 
reserves whatsoever with whom it could replace the 23 diplomats 
questioned by the subcommission.

<F P=106> [Article by Ma.S.: "Trust Toward Establishments and </F>
Organizations; Radio In the Lead"; table not included] 
  [Text] As far as establishments and organizations are 
concerned, public radio is enjoying the greatest trust. In 
rating support, the government is only slightly ahead of the 
Sejm, and trust in the president is the most unsteady. 
Evaluations of three of the 15 establishments examined by the 
Center for Research on Public Opinion [OBOP] are worse than the 
evaluation of the president: "Solidarity '80," "Self-Defense," 
and private banks. 
  For the first time, the ranking of trust has included public 
radio as an independent establishment (before that the 
television and the radio were treated as one). Right at the 
beginning, it gained a considerable advantage over other 
"competitors." A comparison of opinion polls conducted between 
May 1993 and May 1994 shows that support for television is the 
most stable and at the same time very high. 
  Between March and May, there was a decrease in trust toward 
all establishments, with the exception of public television. 
The drop was not great--about 2 or 3 percent--with two 
exceptions: Support for the Independent Self-Governing Trade 
Union "Solidarity" plummeted by 8 percent, and support for the 
government fell by 7 percent. It is worth recalling that, in 
April, we witnessed the strongest wave of strikes in recent 
times. Thus, both sides lost as a result of this conflict. 
  Nevertheless, the president is the record holder as far as 
the greatest trust decrease is concerned. Within four months, 
trust in him went down by 12 percent. The greatest supporters 
of Lech Walesa are the inhabitants of rural areas and the 
largest towns and cities, believers and churchgoers, and those 
who declare that their views are rightist or center rightist. 
There are no great differences resulting from age. 
  In the course of one year, most noticeable is the increase 
in 
trust toward the Sejm, and, only to a slightly smaller degree, 
in trust toward the government. The Sejm, where the coalition 
of the Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party is 
in a definite majority, is trusted more than twice as much as 
its predecessor.

1,107-person sample.

<F P=106> [Article by A.Sl.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F>
RZECZPOSPOLITA on Inflation, Wages, and Unemployment; Faith in 
the Government Increases Along With Incomes"] 
  [Text] Only 20 percent of adult Poles believe in the 
government's promises that inflation will be decreased to less 
than 10 percent by 1997 and that the number of unemployed will 
be limited to 2.7 million people. Slightly more--27 
percent--believe that the real wages will be rising at the 
announced rate of 1.5 to 2 percent a year. These are the 
results of a poll carried out by the Public Opinion Research 
Institute [PBS] in Sopot. 
  People with higher education more frequently than others 
believe in the plans for decreasing unemployment and increasing 
real wages (23.5 percent and 34 percent, respectively). However, 
they are least convinced about the promises of limiting 
inflation (17 percent). Generally, the research suggests that 
various social, professional, and age groups have extremely 
varied views regarding the wage increase and unemployment 
limitation. Opinions concerning the lowering of inflation are 
similar. It is also difficult to say that one group trusts the 
government promises more than other groups do. Least skeptical 
about the promise of decreasing inflation are people employed on 
farms (25 percent believe in it), and about the promise of 
limiting unemployment--the employees of private companies (25 
percent believe in it). The promise concerning higher real wages 
convinces the budget sphere the most (36 percent). The material 
situation does not greatly influence opinions concerning 
inflation. However, there is a certain pattern in the evaluation 
of plans concerning an increase in wages: The trust increases 
along with higher incomes. Among persons with less than 700,000 
zlotys [Z] per capita, this trust amounts to only 21 percent; 
among persons earning over Z3 million, to 42 percent. A similar 
pattern can be observed in the evaluations of the forecasts 
concerning unemployment: The optimism increases along with 
incomes. 
  Most skeptical about an increase in real wages are peasants 
(18 percent believe in it), and the group that believes in it 
the most are managers--39 percent. Plans for limiting 
unemployment seem feasible primarily to private entrepreneurs 
(31 percent); housewives are most skeptical about it--only 13 
percent believe in it. School and university students constitute 
the group that believes in decreasing inflation the most--23 
percent; housewives--14 percent. It is worth noting that each 
time the greatest number of undecided people is among peasants 
and farm employees--from 35 to 41 percent. 
  Is faith in the government's promises of a political nature? 
This question can be answered after an analysis of the results 
and the political sympathies of the respondents. The 
government's promises concerning decreasing inflation is least 
trusted by the supporters of the Confederation for an 
Independent Poland, the former Liberal-Democratic Congress, and 
the Center Accord (10 in each case). Those who trust those 
promises the most are the voters of the Non-Party Bloc in 
Support of Reforms (as many as 41 percent). For the sake of 
comparison, among the supporters of the governing coalition--the 
Polish Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance--faith in 
limiting inflation is 22 and 24 percent, respectively. 
Supporters of the Union for Real Politics and of the Coalition 
for the Republic are those who most strongly believe in plans 
for limiting unemployment. Voters of the Labor Union believe in 
this promise the least. 
  The research was conducted by PBS in Sopot on 14 and 15 May 
on a 1,010-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of 
Poland. 
  In line with the government's plans, in 1997 inflation is 
supposed to drop below 10 percent. Do you believe that the 
government will put its plan into effect? 
  60 percent--No, I do not. 
  18 percent--Yes, I do. 
  22 percent--It is hard to tell. 
  The government claims that real wages will increase by 1.5 
to 
2.5 percent a year in the coming years. Do you believe that the 
government will put its plans into effect? 
  People with not more than Z700,000 per capita: Yes--21 
percent. 
  People with Z701,000-1 million per capita: Yes--23 percent. 
  People with Z1 million-1.5 million per capita: Yes--24 
percent. 
  People with Z1.6 million-2 million per capita: Yes--31 
percent. 
  People with Z2 million-3 million per capita: Yes--27 
percent. 
  People with over Z3 million per capita: Yes--42 percent.

<F P=106> [Article by "U.K.": "Wieslaw Kaczmarek on the Strike in the </F>
Katowice Steelworks: `Meeting the Demands Endangers the 
Enterprise'"] 
  [Text] Since 1 June, an occupation strike has been 
in progress in the Katowice Steelworks, which was begun by the 
"August 80" trade union and was joined by a significant portion 
of the employees. Meeting the demands of the striking workers 
would cause a loss of the enterprise's financial liquidity and 
make it impossible for the enterprise to meet its obligations, 
including salary obligations. The Katowice Steelworks would 
then end the year with a 720 billion zloty [Z] deficit and with 
an increase of salary costs amounting to Z130 billion, Ownership 
Transformations Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek told journalists on 6 
June. 
  The Ownership Transformations Ministry has also conducted 
estimates of two other possible options. The first one envisages 
further activity by the steelworks, without changes in the 
salary situation. Under that option, the company would have a 
chance to end the year with a surplus of Z160 billion. Under a 
second scenario, where it is assumed that agreements signed on 
31 May by six trade union centers would be implemented, the 
steelworks would end the year with a deficit of Z86 billion, 
with salary costs having risen by Z45 billion. 
  Because of the enterprise's particular significance for the 
country's economy (steel pig-iron) and a network of cooperative 
ties, the strike's impact will be felt not just by the 
steelwork's employees. If there is someone who is deliberately 
leading the enterprise to disaster, he should be aware of the 
consequences, Minister Kaczmarek said. He added that, in this 
situation, it will be the government's duty to have the 
necessary imports of steel for domestic industries, even though 
he would not like to threaten anyone with that. 
  Katowice Steelworks lived through its worst crisis in the 
1991-92 period. The year 1993 showed the first symptoms of 
overcoming the crisis--the steelworks ended the year with a 
positive result of Z590 billion and a net profit amounting to 
Z180 billion. At the same time, conciliation proceedings with 
banks were conducted as a result of which the steelworks' debt 
level was reduced by 30 percent. The remainder is to be repaid 
in 18 installments by the end of 1994. The company also 
received governmental guarantees for an investment in a 
continuous steel-production division. These measures created a 
chance for a better future for the enterprise. The current 
situation creates the danger of wasting what has already been 
achieved. I am afraid that the outcome of this will turn out to 
be dangerous for many companies in Poland that will have nothing 
to produce with. Already at this stage, trains with steel 
pig-iron are being prevented from leaving, and that is called 
anarchy. 
  I am hoping that the strike organizers will come to their 
senses. In addition, all measures should be undertaken within 
the confines of the law, Minister Kaczmarek said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Krystyna </F>
Szelestowska; place and date not given: "Can We Pass Up China?"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Szelestowska] However, you 
still have not answered my question: What did the talks of the 
Sejm delegation concerning human rights in China look like? 
  [Oleksy] Whenever I was talking about our standards of 
democracy, the hosts stressed that other countries should not 
impose their own rules on anyone. They kept saying that they do 
not agree with our interpretation of human rights, because, for 
China, a country populated by 1.2 billion people, the most 
important rights consist in supplying food, clothing, shelter, 
and other things to the people. Democratization is not one of 
the priorities. The chairman of the Chinese parliament asked me 
the following question: Is the world aware of the possible 
international consequences of a breakdown of the situation in 
China caused by famine or an outbreak of social dissatisfaction 
and rebellion? 
  [Szelestowska] What did you say to the hosts? 
  [Oleksy] I said that public opinion is concerned about the 
limitation of freedom in China, that we will be satisfied with 
any progress in this area, and that we have not changed our 
opinion on this. 
  [Szelestowska] Despite the great differences in the approach 
toward the issue of human rights, we are making every effort to 
have good relations with China... 
  [Oleksy] This is decided by the importance of China, which 
will soon become the greatest market. China is characterized by 
the fastest development rate in the world--over 17 percent last 
year. Right now it is going down to the level of 9 percent; it 
is doing this consciously, for fear of overheating the economy. 
  The Chinese are living with the future, reforms, and 
openness 
to the world. They are making very profound analyses of the 
mistakes of the past centralized socialism, the several year's 
experience of the postcommunist countries, as well as their 
mistakes, the consequences of those mistakes, and the 
difficulties of Western states. They want to transfer what is 
best for their policy of reforms and openness. On many 
occasions, they repeat the thought of Deng Xiaoping: "Capitalism 
has its planning, and socialism can have its market." This 
individual, third path of development is yielding good results. 
  [Szelestowska] You said that our turnover should reach $1 
billion. We reached this level in the past, in 1986. However, 
is it possible to reach this level now? 
  [Oleksy] I believe it is. China perceives Poland as the 
greatest country in Central Europe that is familiar and 
increasingly closely linked to the European Union and that, at 
the same time, knows well the reality of East Europe. The hosts 
stressed that there are no conflicts between our countries. 
Bejing has no reservations concerning Poland's integration with 
Western Europe or its membership in NATO. It wants to cooperate 
with us; however, this cooperation will to a considerable degree 
depend on ourselves. If we perceive China exclusively as a 
country with prisons full of dissidents, inhabited by 
yellow-complexioned, slant-eyed people eating dogs, if we wait 
for a revolt to break out, we will pass up our chance. Business 
favorable to us can be conducted already now. This has been 
noted by the businessmen who accompanied the Sejm delegation on 
its visit to China. 
  [Szelestowska] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [From the press review of GAZETA WYBORCZA] </F>
  [Text] Warsaw, 6 Jun--Boleslaw Sulik, one of the members of 
the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council [KRRiT], 
returns to the controversy around the activity of this body. We 
experienced the first serious conflict with politics in 
November, as a result of Wieslaw Walendziak's nomination as 
chairman of the new public television, Sulik recalls. In his 
view, it is an excessive simplification to perceive the conflict 
that then began as a war between Lech Walesa and the National 
Council. There are a number of other strategists and tacticians 
at the Belweder Palace and elsewhere who are personally engaged 
in this rather one-sided war. At its roots there lies the 
characteristically Polish shock of discovery that a 
constitutional body, born from a law that is democratic in 
letter and in spirit and as an independent body, may behave and 
function independently. 
  It transpires irrefutably from the reaction of the Belweder 
Palace that our decision disappointed their expectations, Sulik 
claims, referring to the granting of the nationwide broadcasting 
concession to "PolSat," and stresses that the preferences of the 
president and his people were never specified by name. It is 
possible to presume, from incidental evidence, that they would 
look with favor upon the continued presence in Poland of 
"Polonia 1" and UFY, that is the German concern of Bertelsmann, 
now associated with Marian Terlecki's "Antena 1." 
  Instead of having a serious critique of the council's 
decision or a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the 
various applications, we have a campaign of insinuations, 
denunciations, and defamation. It is Sulik's judgment that, 
over a year of activity, the council has surely committed not a 
few errors, but, in the state's interest, it has bravely 
skirmished and continues to skirmish with the greedy and 
ruthless pursuit of personal interests. Sulik appeals to his 
countrymen who feel anger, if they have maintained the 
capability to do so, at glaring cases of cynicism in political 
life, which is how democracy is functioning.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jacek Kuron, Union of Freedom activist and </F>
former labor and social policy minister, by correspondent 
Andrzej Sondej; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Sondej] How do you assess the Union of Freedom's 
position on the political stage? After all, just before the 
unification of the Democratic Union [UD] and the Liberal 
Democratic Congress [KLD], some people said that a union with 
the Liberals would cause the UD to shift to the right. 
  [Kuron] When discussing the position of various political 
groups on the left and right sides of the Polish political 
stage, we must first determine where the front and back of that 
stage are placed. That is why I do not use the left-right 
criterion for defining political positions. For me, the basis 
for such a definition is a given group's attitude to the tenets 
of the market economy and to public expectations and ambitions. 
As a result of the transformations that have taken place in the 
country to date, two camps have emerged, which can be 
designated, in jest, as the friends of the market and the 
friends of the people. UD was characterized by considerable 
sensitivity to social issues, while the KLD attracted a large 
number of pragmatists who understood very well that no one can 
introduce free market principles against the wishes of the 
population. The unification itself could, of course, lead to a 
reinforcement of promarket sympathies and a weakening of social 
concerns. In other words, friends of the market will gain 
domination over friends of the people. This can happen, but it 
is not inevitable that it will happen. 
  [Sondej] Are you not afraid that the Union of Freedom has 
lost a proportion of its electorate, the one hailing from UD, 
and that, consequently, competition for councillors' seats in 
the forthcoming local government elections will end in a failure 
for your new party? 
  [Kuron] I believe that the unification itself will not have 
affected our chances too strongly. Electoral coalitions were 
formed in individual parishes prior to the UD-KLD fusion. What 
is more, in some parishes the Liberals would not have gone to 
the polls alongside the UD activists in any case. Certainly the 
change of the party's name will to some extent do harm to our 
chances in the election. It is as if, immediately after a major 
promotion campaign to advertise the "Mazowszanka" mineral water, 
I were to change its name to "Warszawianka." Nevertheless, at 
the local level, the majority of contending parties have adopted 
their own names in the elections, and the Union of Freedom name 
and logo will not influence them in any decisive way. Even so, 
we must always calculate which move will be more advantageous. 
Politicians must be aware of the possibility that, even if 
their vision gains acceptance, they may still lose the 
elections. We must recognize this possibility: It is the 
fundamental duty of every person who chooses to be involved in 
politics. 
  [Sondej] But you yourself decided not to put down your name 
as a candidate for a position in the national leadership of the 
united party. Some members of the Union of Freedom leadership 
team maintain that you intend to run for the presidency in the 
proposed 1995 election. 
  [Kuron] Not at all! I am not interested in winning the 
president's seat. I want to continue to be actively involved in 
politics, and I have a program that will make it possible for 
Poland to overcome the present crisis. Consequently, I want to 
be prime minister. It is a natural thing for a politician who 
is active in the political arena to want to become prime 
minister: If he does not, it means that he chose the wrong 
profession. I have a vision of creating a kind of "politicians' 
roundtable" at which people committed to politics would together 
work out a compact on the ethical principles of their policies. 
Social dialogue should constitute the foundation of Polish 
politics. Only in that way can we accomplish the task of 
transformations in our country. I believe that this vision 
could lead me to the prime minister's position--although that is 
not inevitable. I will not take umbrage and go away sulking if 
someone else is chosen to realize my program. The president 
embodies the dignity of the Republic's statehood and is 
therefore obliged to strive for the stabilization of the 
political arena. He must not in any circumstances engage in 
pursuing active politics. 
  [Sondej] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Union of Labor Chairman Ryszard Bugaj by </F>
correspondent Henryk Sroczynski; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Sroczynski] What place would you designate for 
your group on Poland's political stage? 
  [Bugaj] Our place on that stage has remained unchanged for a 
long time now. On the other hand, the Democratic Union [UD], 
which used to occupy the center position, has now clearly moved 
to the right, while the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has moved 
at least to a center position. 
  [Sroczynski] Are you trying to say that you are now the most 
left-oriented party? 
  [Bugaj] Indeed, that is what we are. With one reservation, 
however: that the political scene in Poland is, as a whole, 
somewhat right-oriented. 
  [Sroczynski] There was a time when you hoped to win over a 
proportion of the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ] deputies 
who were members of the Democratic Left Alliance Parliamentary 
Caucus. These calculations did not materialize.... 
  [Bugaj] The SLD leadership is firm and, as you saw for 
yourself during the budget vote, it decided to expel from their 
parliamentary club anyone who dares to vote against their 
instructions. However, there are many people there who 
articulate the issues which were on the agenda during the 
election campaign. On the other hand, there are also the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP] activists delegated to 
operate in the trade unions. I do not know what their 
proportional numbers are. 
  [Sroczynski] The differences which already existed between 
you, Waldemar Pawlak, and Aleksander Kwasniewski have deepened 
since the time when you negotiated with them the possibility of 
your joining the parliamentary coalition. Why is that? 
  [Bugaj] We have not noticed any marked changes in their 
stand on social and economic issues. Nor do we conclude from 
Mr. Kolodko's public statements that such changes are about to 
take place. The second area in which we have reservations about 
their positions concerns questions of personnel appointments: 
An increasing number of figures from the past have been 
appearing on the scene. The third bloc of contentious issues 
entails relations with the President's Office. The president's 
actions can hardly be defined as constructive. Why was the 
situation allowed whereby certain ministries come directly under 
the president's decisions? Why was the concept of a 
"presidential ministry" created at all? There are also certain 
matters on which, it seemed, there were no appreciable 
differences between ourselves on the one hand and the SLD-PSL 
bloc on the other. I am thinking here of our proposal for a 
constitutional referendum. By now it is more and more often 
that we can hear them say: We do not know.... Let us wait and 
see.... 
  [Sroczynski] How do you assess the opposition in the Sejm? 
Do you not think that it is weak and contributes very little? 
  [Bugaj] Indeed, it is weak. There are two reasons for its 
weakness. First, the coalition is far stronger because it 
commands a large number of seats in parliament; second, despite 
the many accusations being leveled against it, the coalition is 
relatively well consolidated. On the other hand, the 
opposition, which is to be found both on the left and the right 
side (although I do not quite know where to place the 
Confederation for an Independent Poland), is certainly rather 
weak. That is why it has a very limited chances of standing up 
successfully to the government and opposing its plans. 
  [Sroczynski] Perhaps the Sejm itself is too weak? 
  [Bugaj] If you are referring to the political elites' level 
of competence in discharging their brief, I would agree with 
that proposition. It is equally true of the parliamentary 
parties representing the government coalition and the opposition. 
  [Sroczynski] We will soon see the launch of the presidential 
election campaign. Consequently, we can surely assume that 
there is much discussion in your party on your future candidate 
for the president's office. In your opinion, who should run for 
the presidency from your group? 
  [Bugaj] I would like to see a candidate representing a 
center-left orientation, and, most importantly, offering a 
guarantee of a serious attitude to the discharge of his duties 
and an unconditional respect for the constitution. So far, a 
candidate combining these qualities has not materialized. 
However, I am still hopeful that we will find him. 
  [Sroczynski] What do you think of the chances of candidates 
proposed by the right wing? The right is, after all, about to 
become consolidated and create a united confederation. 
  [Bugaj] I have become accustomed to situations whereby, if 
you hear a public statement from the right-wing camp on a 
Monday, you can be certain that it will be disclaimed on 
Tuesday, that something entirely new will be announced on 
Wednesday, and that by Thursday it will be back to the original 
Monday statement again. Consequently, I cannot tell with any 
certainty what will happen in the right-wing camp in the near 
future and, to tell the truth, I am not particularly interested. 
  [Sroczynski] But let us assume that every major political 
group nominates its own candidates to the office of president. 
Who will stand the best chance then? 
  [Bugaj] I believe that in the first round the chances will 
be even, and by the second round the presidential election will 
become a lottery. 
  [Sroczynski] In other words, you believe that certain 
related political groups should come to an agreement and 
nominate their presidential candidate jointly? Would your party 
be willing to participate in such an agreement? 
  [Bugaj] I hope so.

<F P=106> [Article by Wlodzimierz Gnarowski, chief designer of the </F>
I-22 Iryda aircraft: "Iryda With New Capabilities"] 
  [Text] At the Mielec airport, Engineers Tadeusz 
Lechowicz and Grzegorz Warkocki, test pilots at the Aviation 
Institute [Instytut Lotnictwa], have performed their first 
flight on an M-93 Iryda, with modern aviation equipment that has 
been integrated by a French firm named SAGEM. 
  The flight was the first step in the implementation of a 
joint demonstration program by the Mielec Polish Aviation Plant 
[PZL- Mielec], SAGEM, and the Aviation Institute. The main goal 
of the program is to present the plane's expanded capabilities. 
  The development of aviation technology in recent years was 
to 
a large extent possible because of the introduction on board of 
aircraft and helicopters, of modern electronic systems called 
aviation electronics. Microprocessors, computers, radars, 
lasers, and electronic meters have been widely applied in both 
civilian and military aviation. The solutions used thus far 
with regard to onboard systems of Iryda training/combat aircraft 
were largely based on equipment coming from the former USSR, 
which was a logical consequence of using the equipment in combat 
planes of the Polish Air Forces and of the practical 
accessibility of that type of equipment. Currently, it is 
possible to modernize Iryda quickly by introducing aviation 
electronic systems produced in Western countries. It is not 
possible to design or manufacture domestically a wide array of 
equipment required in the plane, within time limits set by the 
user. So there is a need to rely on foreign producers, while 
not giving up domestic designs for the future, in those cases 
where it is justified economically. 
  The Aviation Institute and PZL-Mielec have jointly 
considered 
offers of some leading foreign producers of aviation 
electronics. They have chosen the SAGEM company for the 
implementation of the demonstration program, during which modern 
aviation electronics were placed into and integrated with the 
aircraft. The equipment installed includes, among others, 
precise systems of inertial navigation [nawigacja 
bezwladnosciowa] and satellite navigation, computers 
facilitating the carrying out of precisely-targeted attacks, as 
well as electronic meters that describe flight parameters and 
that make it easier to perform tasks. 
  As a result of this work, the M-93 Iryda aircraft was born, 
which will make it possible to train pilots and trainees (during 
flights and during performance of air-to-air and air-to-ground 
combat tasks) while using modern equipment, which, in a way, 
reflects the performance of those tasks using combat aircraft 
during ordinary and difficult weather conditions, both at night 
and during the day. The Inertial Navigation System (INS) makes 
it possible to train a pilot under conditions that approximate 
war conditions, regardless of the infrastructure on the ground. 
  The solution adopted is open to possible further 
modernizations, depending on the needs of the aircraft's 
developmental versions. Among others, the navigation/targeting 
computer can be adapted to navigation depending on terrain 
features, while the entire system can be supplemented by a 
FLIR-type device whose goal is to fight targets with no 
visibility and to conduct reconnaissance tasks.

<F P=106> [Article by "P.S.": "Bank Credits; So Far, No Revival"; </F>
accompanying diagram not included] 
  [Text] The recent lowering of the central bank's 
interest rates caused credits offered by Polish banks to get 
cheaper, often times significantly. Economic growth and a 
revival in economic activity causes an increased need for 
financial means. NOWA EUROPA has asked the representatives of a 
few banks which are leaders among credit-providers, about the 
level of interest in credits on the part of potential 
customers. 
  The lowering of interest rates took place only recently, so 
it is too soon to talk about trends, Andrzej Dorosz, director of 
Pekao SA's Credit and Guarantees Department, told NOWA EUROPA. 
One should also not draw too far-reaching conclusions after a 
few months of this year. But one could mention an increased 
level of interest shown by large economic units in high 
investment credits. Measures for providing credits to the 
population are also developing--the bank introduced that service 
relatively recently. These are standard loans which are 
dependent on salary levels. 
  Polska Kasa Opieki-Bank Panstwowy [PKO BP] is Poland's 
largest credit-provider (almost 60 trillion zlotys last year). 
Faced with an increased interest in credits on the part of both 
enterprises and the population, as well as faced with growing 
competition, the bank has been widening its array of offers more 
and more. For instance, in the case of housing credits, PKO BP 
is most eager to see those customers, who need money to complete 
their investments. We have an asymmetrical credit portfolio 
which is dominated by multi-year housing credits of a specific 
nature, Janusz Ostaszewski, PKO BP's press spokesman said. We 
have not reported a revival since the beginning of the year. 
Providing credits is not an area where changes would take place 
fast. A lowering of interest rates does not cause an immediate 
increase in the level of interest shown in these interest rates. 
With installment purchases by the population in mind, noncash 
credits have been prepared. Credit repayment for purchasing 
cars has been extended to four years. 
  The large portfolio of Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej [BGZ], 
is 
a result of the difficult situation in agriculture and in the 
processing industry, rather than being a result of economic 
expansion, said Leszek Wisniewski, BGZ's deputy chairman. The 
situation has been imposed on us--we have no intention of 
extending the measures to those sectors of the economy which are 
not the strongest ones. I am not optimistic when it comes to 
those sectors. True, there are several stronger sectors, but 
the majority is weak, for instance the sugar industry, or the 
grain and milling industries. We report no revival, and the 
level of interest in investment credits is very minor. It is 
the same case with preferential credits--loans for buying out or 
restructuring farms, or for modernization of the processing 
industry, have interest rates which are as low as 23 percent. 
  During the first four months of this year, the structure of 
credits granted by the Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy in Lodz, has 
changed, said Bogdan Jachowicz, the bank's press spokesman. The 
contribution of central investments increased from 77.7 percent 
at the end of the year, to 79.4 percent. The number of credits 
for socialized enterprises has decreased slightly: from 10.8 
percent down to 10.2 percent, and when it comes to nonsocialized 
enterprises, the decline was from 10.5 percent to 9.3 percent. 
Credits for the population increased by 0.1 percent--up to 1.1 
percent.

<F P=106> [Interview with Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol by </F>
Maria Nowak; place and date not given: "Opening Doors for 
Business Community; Special Economic Zones Will Be Established"] 
  [Text] [Nowak] Around the world, several hundred special 
economic zones [S.E.Z] are in operation. They are also called 
industrial zones, free customs zones, or industrial bases. They 
are regarded as a way of achieving economic growth that has 
passed its test, and they are to be established also in Poland. 
Recently, the government adopted a draft law on S.E.Z.'s. Mr. 
Minister, when will the idea be actually implemented? 
  [Pol] The government will approve the final version of the 
draft law in June. Then, it will be submitted to the Sejm and 
one should expect the parliament to adopt the law in October. 
Which means we will begin establishing the first S.E.Z.'s by 
the end of the year. 
  [Nowak] At the stage of working on its concept, why did the 
Industry and Trade Ministry use the experience of an Irish firm 
called Development Ireland? 
  [Pol] The choice of the firm was determined by an auction, 
and also by the fact that the firm succeeded in establishing one 
of the best functioning S.E.Z.'s in the world, that is the 
Shannon zone. Among others, highly processed production is 
concentrated in the zone. 
  [Nowak] The draft law envisages economic preferential 
treatment for investors, as well as the easing of procedures. 
What will these entail? 
  [Pol] The most important point will be a tax break when it 
comes to income tax, which in the West is known as corporate 
tax. We envisage a complete waiver from the tax for half of the 
period for which a particular S.E.Z. will be established, while 
in the other half of the zone's existence, we envisage a 
50-percent tax break. What does this mean? If we establish a 
S.E.Z. for a period of 20 years, then some units--the most 
attractive ones which we will be most eager to have--will be 
able to gain a waiver from corporate tax for a period of 10 
years, which is really an enormously significant advantage. 
  Apart from that, we envisage breaks on real estate taxes, an 
accelerated depreciation, as well as a possibility of deducting 
investment expenditures from costs. And I think the easing of 
customs and bureaucratic procedures, are also important. We 
want to have the kind of situation where investors operating in 
a S.E.Z. would concentrate on the process of producing whatever 
they want to produce, while the area's manager will be obliged 
to secure property and all kinds of services for the producers, 
for instance telecommunications services. We intend to minimize 
the cost of manufacturing merchandise and services, in order to 
increase their competitiveness. 
  [Nowak] Who will make decisions on the establishment of the 
zones? 
  [Pol] Only the government will be authorized to make such 
decisions. 
  [Nowak] Supposing some territorial authorities are not 
interested in a particular S.E.Z. because the advantages gained 
from its establishment will not compensate for the loss of 
income revenue. What will happen then? 
  [Pol] We will not force anybody to do anything--such is the 
general rule. But it is true that we are granting waivers, we 
give up on collecting some taxes, but the state will receive 
personal income taxes at the same time. And if people work 
instead of collecting unemployment benefit, then for the state 
budget, that means revenue instead of expenditures. We also 
have the VAT tax since production is growing. These are revenue 
sources and we are basing our concept of S.E.Z.'s on such 
principles, while also taking into account the need to make the 
regions more active generally speaking. After conducting a 
global analysis, one will see that it really pays to have a 
S.E.Z. in a particular region. 
  [Nowak] Who will represent the State Treasury's interests in 
such a zone? 
  [Pol] Primarily the industry and trade minister. But I also 
want to be clear that this does not exclude the finance 
minister's right to exercise supervision, nor does it exclude 
the foreign economic cooperation minister's involvement for 
instance in issues of customs law. 
  [Nowak] Will foreign investors be authorized to conduct 
economic activity in these S.E.Z.'s, or will it be restricted to 
companies with foreign capital? 
  [Pol] Anyone will be able to conduct economic activity. We 
envisage no limitations whatsoever, neither when it comes to the 
kind of capital, nor regarding its source. We need both big and 
small investors, both Polish and foreign ones. We also intend 
to introduce no distinctions when it comes to tax breaks and 
other procedures. We introduce the same rules for all firms. 
  [Nowak] Could the scale of investment have an impact on the 
size of tax breaks? 
  [Pol] Yes, but this is not just about the investment scale. 
The idea of S.E.Z.'s is much more comprehensive than that. 
Apart from so-called multifaceted zones where we will be 
particularly eager to see investors with big projects, we will 
also want to establish zones geared toward some specific fields. 
In such cases, the size of the investment is not as important 
as its content [preceding word published in italics], meaning 
its know-how [preceding two words published in English], the 
project's technological value, and so forth. Apart from that, 
there is a need both for someone to produce a product, and also 
for someone to provide service to the investor in question. 
  [Nowak] Since the size of the capital that was invested, 
among others, is to determine the size of the breaks granted, 
what will be the capital's minimum value required? 
  [Pol] We envisage neither an upper nor a lower limit. 
Investment quality, employment size, and the project's 
proecological nature, will be of particular importance to us. 
  [Nowak] Conducting economic activity in S.E.Z.'s would also 
facilitate the establishment of a duty-free area. Is this being 
taken into account? 
  [Pol] Absolutely yes. It is our ambition to have a 
duty-free area in each S.E.Z. It is a very important issue. We 
even want to take things so far--and we will cooperate with the 
Foreign Economic Cooperation Ministry and with the Main Customs 
Office on that issue--as to have each S.E.Z. have its own 
customs office. Along with customs officials, we would like to 
set up modern customs services procedures to make activity 
easier, and not to be an obstacle. 
  [Nowak] Foreign investors may be interested in purchasing 
land or real estate in the area of the S.E.Z.'s. Will they have 
a right to do so? 
  [Pol] Yes, they will. They can both buy and lease land. We 
envisage all possible kinds of mechanisms--after all, some like 
to work on their own property while some others do not, since 
their involvement is on a short-term basis only. That is why we 
must be flexible. 
  [Nowak] Waivers for firms having to sell foreign currency 
acquired from the sale of merchandise and services manufactured 
in an S.E.Z. to currency banks, could be a strong investment 
incentive. 
  [Pol] We are trying to get the National Bank of Poland and 
the Finance Ministry to issue such a currency permit to the 
firms. But I cannot say at this stage whether we will succeed 
since this is a strategic issue, linked with the state's 
financial security. We think our idea could be regarded as an 
experiment. 
  [Nowak] Will every unit be able to conduct activity in a 
S.E.Z., or do you perhaps envisage auctions or other types of 
measures? 
  [Pol] Generally speaking, we regard auctions as an excellent 
way of selecting the best. In case the auction procedure is not 
used, the industry and trade minister will determine who will 
have the right to conduct economic activity. 
  [Nowak] How many such areas are being planned in Poland? 
  [Pol] We do not want to create a multitude of such areas 
throughout the country. We want to approach the concept with 
caution in the beginning. We will begin with a pilot zone 
[strefa pilotazowa], followed--within two to three years--by two 
or three more, and then we will see how they function in 
practice and how profitable they are. Depending on the outcome, 
we will either be opening up the door, or closing it. 
  [Nowak] Does the ministry already have specific ideas as to 
where exactly it would like to initiate the experiment? 
  [Pol] At this stage, I would rather not mention all the 
regions being considered by us. I will just speak briefly about 
Mielec. The town was one of the initiators of the whole 
concept, and it has fought for its implementation. It is an 
area of aviation industrial monoculture, with a high 
unemployment rate but also with a very highly skilled cadre and 
an excellent infrastructure. After all, there is an airport on 
the territory of the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant, on 
which any aircraft can land, including a Boeing 777. There is 
also a railway network--both narrow-track and wide-track--so 
this could for instance be a place for reloading shipments from 
the Far East (going through the former USSR) to West Europe, and 
vice versa. There is also hot and cold water, electricity, 
assembly halls and modern equipment. Planes are manufactured 
there, and the company cooperates with the Boeing concern by 
producing aircraft doors for Boeing--that is proof of what the 
plant is capable of. Mielec's location is also an asset--it is 
close to the eastern border, and if one wants to take some time 
off after work, Bieszczady Mountains are just around the corner. 
  Generally speaking, we will first take into account those 
regions where a big potential has been accumulated but it has 
not been fully used up to now, for instance the construction 
site for a nuclear power plant in Zarnowiec. 
  [Nowak] Do foreign investors show an interest in our zones 
about which there has been much publicity for the second year in 
a row? 
  [Pol] Yes, they do. Actually, they show a very big interest 
but I am not authorized to disclose trade secrets. 
  [Nowak] Could you at least tell us what countries these 
investors represent? 
  [Pol] The largest amount of offers came from the United 
States, perhaps because so-called industrial parks [parki 
przemyslowe] are very popular there, and businessmen know that 
it is simply good business. We also have many proposals from 
Germany, Italy, France, and also from our domestic capital, 
which is a particular reason for joy. 
  [Nowak] Mr. Minister, can you tell us what kind of economic 
activity do they want to conduct? 
  [Pol] They are interested in the production of passenger 
cars, trucks, and various kinds of building materials which are 
often very complicated. We have also received offers that take 
the skills of the Mielec crew into account--this is, among 
others, the plastic treatment of metals.

  [Text] The main hearing at the trial of Dusko Tomic, 
secretary-general of the 1st Children's Embassy, will begin on 
11 June, Bosnia-Herzegovina Press reports. It is suspected that 
Tomic has cooperated with the aggressor and he is considered the 
one most guilty for the inadequate organization of a convoy 
carrying food from Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], which eventually ended up in the 
aggressor's hands in Pale.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Dr. Muhamed Filipovic, </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to Switzerland and deputy chairman 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Academy of Sciences, by Luisa Ballin 
and Nefail Maliqi; place and date of interview not given: "The 
World Must Not Allow the Formation of Greater Serbia"] 
  [Excerpts] [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] We talked to Professor 
Dr. Muhamed Filipovic, author of 15 scientific and political 
works, deputy chairman of the Academy of Sciences of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and currently Bosnian ambassador in Bern, 
Switzerland, about the current situation in the former Yugoslav 
lands, especially about the two-year war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
the factor and role of the Albanian people in the Balkans, 
Yugoslav crimes and criminals, about Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], and about many other 
problems related to the former Yugoslavia. First of all, 
Ambassador, what is your view of the two-year interethnic 
conflict, or rather, what is your view of the current situation 
in the former Yugoslav lands, especially in Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Filipovic] I was actively involved in political life in the 
former Yugoslavia. I was also in the dissident opposition. 
During recent years, since 1967, I carefully monitored Bosnian 
life and life in the former Yugoslavia in general. I said in 
1978 in Cavtat that Yugoslavia, such as it was, would have to 
collapse. I said this because I beleived that the communist 
system, which Yugoslavia had at that time, had completed its 
role in history. It was a system which put society into a 
dictatorial and totalitarian social system. So because of this, 
in my opinion, Yugoslavia no longer exists. The 1974 
Constitution represented some views, but some peoples were 
unhappy with it; first of all the Albanians, who, although they 
enjoyed a certain autonomy, were discriminated against in all 
spheres of life. The pressure continues now and it is direct 
pressure. 
  When I talk to Albanians, I emphasize that I believe that 
the 
Bosnian Muslims are subject to the same situation, since, as you 
can see, they are permitted neither national nor religious 
emancipation. The aims of Serbia in regard to Bosnia are clearly 
seen here. 
  The situation with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
is another case. It takes the form of a controversy in regard to 
the autocephalous church of Macedonia but, in essence, it is a 
question of the nonrecognition of the people and the recognition 
of Macedonia as a some kind of state subject so that even today 
Macedonia is considered in actuality to be part of Serbia, a 
territory of southern Serbia. 
  Let us return to Bosnia. We know well from history that 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has existed for some time, like Albanians and 
Macedonians who have carried out a broad national emancipation, 
and that it once had its own state. But with the formation of 
Tito's Yugoslavia, the rise of nationalism began. The Serbs were 
the most aggressive in their nationalism, which the current 
situation proves. [passage omitted] 
  Much has been said about the fact that the Serbian aggressor 
appeared most fierce in Bosnia. People ask why. We know that 
Bosnia is the key to the existence or the nonexistence of 
"greater Serbia". Therefore, when the Serbs achieve victory in 
Bosnia, they will realize their age-old dreams. I think that 
they are very far away from this but that this is utopia for the 
Serbs. 
  Since the Serbs hate us as a people, they circulate 
propaganda inside and outside the area, saying that we are a 
primitive people, without culture and tradition and without a 
strong army. We should know the clear truth that the Bosnians 
and not the Turks controlled Bosnia for 300 years. No one can 
deceive us by saying that the Bosnian people have a weak army 
and do not have a combat tradition. The Serbs are victims of the 
propaganda line that says that the Turks defended Bosnia. 
  It is true that, during recent days of the war, the Serbs 
caused us great losses, more civilians than soldiers. As for our 
losses during the war, some 90 percent of those killed were 
civilians. 
  According to accurate information, about 56,000 Serbian 
soldiers have died in the Serbian-Muslim war while we Muslims 
have lost 12,800 soldiers. It is true that they have caused 
great losses, not only in lives but also in material goods. But 
this also means that this is the first time that the Serbian 
army is on the losing side. [passage omitted] 
  The war in Bosnia will last until the international 
community 
approves of and decides to create a "greater Serbia", a 
totalitarian state in which all non-Serbs or non-Slavs are 
subjected to such terror. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Peace talks began a long time ago, 
along with the war in B-H, but who knows when this 
incomprehensible war will end. 
  [Filipovic] We can say that this peace process is one of the 
strangest processes in the world up to now. [passage omitted] 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] In the European media and in 
international circles, there is talk about dividing Bosnia into 
three cantons. In your opinion, will Bosnia continue to be 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or will it be cantonized? 
  [Filipovic] Bosnia will continue to be the community of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. But as of now, we still do not know what 
form this state will take. Bosnia will remain a state which did 
not begin its existence just now, but which has existed since 
the eighth century; it was the first Slavic state in this 
region. It had and has its own scientific continuity. It has 
more stable borders than any other state in the Balkans. 
[passage omitted] 
  I welcome the agreement with the Croats for the union of the 
two states. I think that this action by the two parties is very 
positive and that from now on all the Serbian teritories taken 
by force in Croatia and Bosnia will be considered to be 
terrotories occupied by Serbia. Then we will ask the Serbs if 
they want to keep fighting or if they want another solution. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] During an interview with S. 
[Suleyman] 
Uglanini [chairman of the Mulsim National Council of Sandzak] we 
were told, in response to a question, that if Bosnia is divided 
we would demand Sandjak [Sandzak] and unite it with our mother 
country. What is your comment on this? 
  [Filipovic] We consider that, historically, Sandjak is a 
territorial part of Bosnia. Certainly, earlier in its history 
Sandjak belonged to the vilayet of Bosnia and the Bosnian state 
of King Cerka. We are not in favor of changing the boundaries 
with the former Yugoslavia but I would like to say that the 
Bosnians should demand in Serbia everything that the Serbs are 
demanding in Bosnia. 
  Therefore, since the Serbs are demanding some kind of 
autonomy, a republic or whatever we call it, in Bosnia and 
Croatia, Sandjak should also receive full political autonomy 
with the right to unite with Bosnia. Thus, we are demanding 
reciprocity with Serbia. Thus, residents of Sandjak will have 
the same status in Serbia as Serbs will have in Bosnia. This is 
our policy. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Recently some media organs and some 
circles have been saying that when the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is over, the Serbian aggressor will continue the conflict in 
Kosova [Kosovo] and Macedonia. Mr. Ambassador, what do you think 
about this? 
  [Filipovic] I do not think that there will be a war in 
Kosova. I say this because the Serbs will not be able to achieve 
their aims in Bosnia. But, if the war in Bosnia concludes in 
accordance with the Serbs' plans, then the torch of this war 
will extend not only to Kosova but also to Macedonia. Serbian 
plans against the Albanian people in Kosova did not begin in 
1981, but earlier than that, with Cubrilovic, Andric, and 
Garashanin, and continued with the present-day new chetniks, 
such as Milosevic, Arkan, Seselj, and others who have always 
kept their eyes on Kosova for the purpose of plundering it and 
cleansing it of Albanians. What is happening now with the 
Bosnians, with more than 1 million Bosnians outside the country, 
immigrations which are the result of ethnic cleansing by Serbs 
in Bosnia so that they can integrate Bosnia with Serbia, as a 
part of Serbia -- I am afraid will also happen with the 
Albanians in Kosova, where the Serbian regime has begun, by 
means of repression and provocations, to expel some of the 
Albanian population from their ethnic lands. 
  Thus, let me say once again that Bosnia-Herzegovina is the 
key to the existence or nonexistence of "Greater Serbia". 
Therefore, with the division of Bosnia, the chauvinistic Greater 
Serbian aims will be achieved and the conflict will be extended 
to other areas of the former Yugoslavia which are not involved 
in the war. However, I think that the Serbs are very far from 
achieving the age-old idea of a Greater Serbia and that such an 
idea is utopian. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] You have said that there are many war 
criminals in Switzerland. On what do you base your opinion? 
  [Filipovic] We have a list of 70 persons who are suspected 
of 
having committed war crimes and having taken part in criminal 
acts of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Some of them have directly 
participated in massacres, ethnic cleansing, murders, rapes, 
looting, and the demolition and destruction of housing units. 
Another person served as a concentration camp guard. These 
people, who are suspected of being war criminals in the former 
Yugoslavia, many of whom have taken refuge in Switzerland, must 
be brought to justice. We have informed the appropriate organs 
of the Swiss Government about these cases. But that is not all. 
These people are being trained, recruited, and mobilized here in 
Switzerland, voluntarily or against their will, to prepare for 
combat in Bosnia. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] How many dossiers have you compiled 
so 
far, what will you be doing about this in the future, and where 
are these individuals located? 
  [Filipovic] On our initiative, we have exposed persons who 
are currently living in different parts of Europe, such as 
Germany and Switzerland, especially in the German part of 
Switzerland, in places like Zug, Saint Gall, Basel, and Zurich. 
So far we have compiled 10 dossiers and, when the information is 
verified, we will hand them over to the federal organs in 
Switzerland. A number of Swiss lawyers have offered us 
assistance in pursuing these criminals because these suspects 
might leave Switzerland before they can be arrested. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] So far the United Nations secretary 
general has not named the prosecutor of the International Court 
who will be responsible for sentencing the war criminals of the 
former Yugoslavia. Do you think that the United Nations has the 
sentencing of war criminals in mind? 
  [Filipovic] In this direction, there is a lack of political 
will to fulfill the obligations resulting from United Nations 
conventions since 1948 and the resolutions approved by the 
Security Council in regard to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We have confidence that the organs of the countries in which 
the war criminals reside will pursue them and will react 
immediately because these states have all the legal elements for 
such a mission. However, it is disturbing that the International 
Court, at the initiative of the United Nations, is confronted 
with another serious problem: Will it be satisfied with the 
sentencing of small or low-level criminals, or should it also 
bring to justice those who truly deserve to be sentenced for 
ethnic cleansing, which is also considered to be a crime. 
  Slobodan Milosevic, Dobrica Cosic, Ratko Mladic, and Radovan 
Karadzic must be sentenced. They have the main responsibility 
for a policy which has used ethnic criteria to divide peoples 
who have always lived together. 
  [FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT] Does this mean that you are ready to 
demand than the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, 
be arrested and sentenced, where he lives or in Switzerland? 
  [Filopovic] I am presenting the example of Radovan Karadzic 
to you because he launched the idea of ethnic cleansing so that 
they could create a state on ethnic bases, an ethnically pure 
state, using an aggressive logic against a state which is 
recognized by the United Nations and other international 
circles. At the same time, this case is also an example to 
convince individuals and public opinion, in general, to use 
violence and to put ethnic cleansing into practice.

<F P=106> [Report by 3d Corps Press Center] </F>
  [Text] The chetniks were not calm on the battlefields in 
the area of the 3d Corps of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina yesterday again. The most persistent attacks 
were in the free territories of Doboj and Tesanj, as well as at 
our defense positions that the chetnik artillery had fiercely 
turned on. There was no peace on the other battlefields either. 
The increasingly frequent movements by motor vehicles, the 
bringing in of new forces, and the enemy's regrouping are a sign 
of the intensification of the offensive. The chetnik artillery 
pounded Doboj-Tesanj villages and defense lines all the time 
yesterday. A howitzer at Stanovi pounded Putesici and 
Kalosevici, tanks at Sinanovici Guvno and Brze Grane pounded 
Zmajevac, and a Bofors gun at Siljato Brdo was firing on Peliva. 
A chetnik Bofors gun was active at Plane and a B-1 gun from 
(Tomic) Brdo kept destroying Kriz. 
  In the meantime, four buses full of chetniks arrived at the 
Stankova Kosa-Ambariste-Strizijevica line. Chetnik artillery 
occasionally fired at Zavidovici battlefields. Mortar activity 
was registered at Hajderovici. Much more than that, they used 
infantry and antiaircraft weapons to shoot at our defenders 
positions. More than 20 trucks and other motor vehicles have 
arrived in the Zavidovici region. The replacement of forces, 
bringing new ones, and the regrouping accompanied by armored 
transporters along the Lukici-Sjenokos and Podsjelovo-Stog lines 
are a sign of new chetnik strikes. Infantry, antiaircraft, and 
mortar fire, particularly at Privije and Stolac Brdo, marked the 
day yesterday in the Seric-Teslic region. 
  Therefore, there is not as much as one day of the chetniks' 
cease-fire on the 3d Corps battlefields.

  [Text] Doboj, June 7 (TANJUG) -- A woman was killed and her 
daughter wounded in the Serb village of Puracic near Doboj in 
northern Bosnia in the renewed Moslem shelling of the Doboj area 
on Tuesday morning [7 June], Bosnian Serb military sources 
report. The intensive shelling of Doboj in the past two months 
has left 20 civilians dead, five of them children, and more than 
60 wounded. The shelling is a prelude to an all-out Moslem 
attack on that Serb town, which has been openly stated by the 
Moslem commanders, with the aim of cutting the vital corridor 
along the Sava river which links the western and eastern parts 
of the Bosnian Serb republic. 
  The Bosnian Serb army on Tuesday repelled three heavy 
combined artillery-infantry attacks by the Moslems on Mt. Ozren 
in northern Bosnia. The Moslem attack was backed by U.N. 
Leopard tanks, Bosnian Serb military sources say. On April 30 
in the region of Moslem-held Tuzla in northeastern Bosnia, 
Nordic U.N. troops for the first time backed a Moslem ground 
attack on Serb positions which left nine Serb soldiers dead and 
five wounded. The Bosnian Serb army says that the Moslems have 
also been attacking Serb villages in the Mt. Ozren area. 
  In the area of Teslic, Bosnian Serb troops have neutralized 
a 
Moslem commando team, it adds. The Moslems are launching a 
major offensive on the Bosnian Serb republic while their leaders 
are negotiating a general cessation of hostilities in Geneva.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Excerpt] The 3-km exclusion zone from the center of 
Gorazde has still not been cleared of chetniks. UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] neither wants nor has the means to implement 
the NATO ultimatum or UN Security Council Resolution 913. At 
approximately 1800 last night, one fighter of the Bosnian Army 
was seriously wounded in the head inside the 3-km zone. He was 
fired at from the direction of (?Sjenokosa). He was in a 
position that could have only been fired on from inside the 
exclusion zone. UNPROFOR is allowing the Serbs that are not 
carrying any arms to freely enter the suburbs of Fazlagici, 
(?Huljderi), and Zubcici to loot what is still left in these 
settlements. Some 90 Serbs came to (?Huljderi) yesterday. They 
looted houses and loaded everything on tractors. After that, 
they freely passed by the blue helmets. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The situation in the Gradacac region was reported 
to be particularly grave this morning. 
  [Correspondent] Tank, howitzer, and mortar projectiles are 
landing on the central part of the town, the industrial zone, 
suburbs, and the surrounding villages. The most active 
aggressor's stronghold is most certainly that on Gornje Krecane, 
from where the aggressor is firing all types of weapons, 
including hill guns. They are targeting Rajska and Lukavac. 
The greatest number of projectiles has landed on civilian 
houses, which were also subjected to the fiercest barrage fire. 
The aggressor is thought to have fired more than 400 shells. 
According to the latest report, three persons were wounded. 
This morning, Gradacac was subjected to the brutal and wild 
chetnik artillery attacks, which were witnessed by the 
representatives of the international forces.

  [Begin recording] [Bosnian Serb leader Radovan] Karadzic's 
chetniks carried out provocations with infantry weaponry and 
antiaircraft weapons along all lines in the zone covered by the 
[Bosnian Army's] 5th Corps, and particularly in the Bosanska 
Krupa section of the front. Members of [self-proclaimed leader

weapons and heavy machine-guns along all lines of separation 
throughout the night and this morning. They indiscriminately 
shelled (?civilian) villages in the [word indistinct] regions of 
(Strbac), Pecigrad, (Lickovac), and (Skodrovo). Shots and bomb 
explosions could be heard throughout the night on the 
(Strbac)-(?Sturlic) line, which clearly shows that what is 
involved are new clashes between Fikret Abdic's mercenaries and

  [Text] We have heard what the situation is like in Tuzla; 
now let us see what is happening in Bihac. The increasing 
resistance to fundamentalist policy and demands of the 5th Corps 
for offensive actions are causing a mutual settling of scores 
between individual armed groups. It has been learned that the 
greatest number of clashes, killings, and the burning and 
destruction of houses is being directed against progressive 
Muslims, who are advocating a cease-fire with [self-proclaimed 
leader of autonomous province of western Bosnia] Fikret Abdic. 
  Well-informed sources have learned that in Bihac there is 
real chaos. Anarchy and criminals are everywhere, and war 
profiteers are taking up key positions of authority. Refugees 
from Prijedor, Novi, and Krupa are refusing to take further part 
in the fighting because their commanders are pushing them to 
take up the hottest positions, while locals are engaged on 
secondary tasks or are exempt from military service. 
  In keeping with orders from Sarajevo, the command of the 
Fifth Corps is preparing an offensive against Serbian-held 
areas. As a result, the inhabitants of the villages of Sturlic, 
Nisici, and Hale have already been evacuated. 
  However, problems in connection with certain tasks have 
caused clashes within the command of the 5th Corps, and as a 
result several officers have been dismissed. All these problems 
and clashes are continuing with undiminished intensity and are 
causing a very difficult and uncertain situation in the Cazin 
region.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Jovanovic, Dusko Vujadinovic, Goran </F>
Sinadjinovic, and Pedja Bozovic: "The Comeback of Write-offs"] 
  [Text] The latest military successes of the Bosnian 
troops on many fronts, particularly Mount Majevica, and the 
final subordination of the Croatian brigades under the command 
of the central authority in Sarajevo, speaks more and more for 
the likelihood that the war will be settled by operations in the 
field. The agencies are reporting the formation of the joint 
General Staff of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina [BH Army], 
headed by Generals Fikret Muslimovic and Ante Roso. This is, in 
fact, the result of the mission by U.S. General John Galvin, who 
organized and directed many meetings between the Bosnian and the 
Croatian generals. 
  It seems that at the strategic level the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] still has some autonomy: the chief of HVO General 
Staff, General Milivoje Petkovic, said recently in Mostar that 
the HVO units positioned near Orasje would be receiving his 
orders in the case of clashes in Bosanska Posavina [Sava River 
basin], but also that the 107th and 108th HVO brigade, which are 
located in the area of responsibility of the 2d Corps of the BH 
Army are under the direct command of the Bosnian officers. The 
tension is easing in Mostar, while the occasional incidents 
between the Bosnian and Croatian forces no longer have serious 
consequences. It is believed that the Croatian seaports, in 
particular Split and Ploce, are gradually opening for arms 
imports, which are accumulating on the Tuzla front, near the 
northern corridor. What do the troops of the Bosnian new 
federal army have at their disposal at the moment? 
<H5>  Ethnic Diversity </H5>
  The "old" Bosnian army (without the HVO) had some 70,000 to 
80,000 effective soldiers (meaning well-armed), and more than 
100,000 men in reserve forces. They are organized in six corps 
and two independent brigades, which are organized according to 
operational zones. The (JANE'S) SENTINEL agency believes that 
the Bosnians have 85 tanks and around 100 large caliber cannons, 
while there are also, as MONITOR found out, at least 14 
helicopters concentrated in the regions of Zenica (because of 
clashes on Mount Vlasic) and Tuzla (see box). 
  The Bosnian Army's forces are ethnically diverse, and 
correspond to the national makeup of the territory controlled by 
the central government. At least 10 percent of the Bosnian Army 
are Serbs. There is only one unit composed exclusively of Muslim 
soldiers, namely the 7th brigade, which involves volunteers to a 
certain degree as well. 
  The HVO is organized according to the territorial principle. 
The arrangement is according to operational zones, and one such 
zone is made up of six to eight brigades. In the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina the HVO has some 45,000 soldiers (making up a 
total of 22 brigades), five independent regiments, two armored 
motorized platoons, and one special unit with 1,000 
diversionists. 
  One HVO brigade has around 1,800 people (that number used to 
vary from 500 to 2,500), while each of the brigades contains the 
command post, three infantry battalions, and one military police 
platoon. 
  The regiments number around 1,000 fighters. In western 
Herzegovina and the Neretva basin there are 20,000 HVO soldiers, 
in northern Bosnia there are around 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers, 
6,000 to 8,000 soldiers in central Bosnia, some 2,000 soldiers 
in the region of Sarajevo, as much in Bihac, and a quite 
insignificant number in the enclaves of eastern Bosnia. 
  The Croatian forces in central Bosnia are organized within 
the 5th operational zone, while in northern Bosnia the 102d, 
103d, 105th, 107th, 108th, 115th, and 139th brigades are 
deployed within the 4th operational zone. According to Western 
assessments, the HVO has at its disposal 105 tanks (mostly T-54 
and T-55), while as for rocket launchers, it has RPG-7, 
Maljutka, Zolja, Osa, and Ambrust types. Of the multi-stage 
rocket launchers, the HVO has Oganj and Plamen (128 
millimeters), and the manual BM-21. As for cannons these are 
mostly 76 millimeter caliber, and 105 millimeter howitzers. 
  The controversy over a plane loaded with explosives and 
(perhaps) ammunition at Zagreb airport -- it was supposed to 
strengthen the war logistics of the Bosnians -- is not of much 
significance, and is probably aimed at achieving propaganda 
goals. The explosives factory in Vitez -- now controlled by the 
HVO -- is merging with the Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik 
(which was attacked by Serbian Galebs [seagulls] on 28 
February), which produces rockets, cannons and howitzers, as 
well as with the rocket fuel factory in Bugojno and the 
lightweight infantry weapons factory in Konjic. 
  Serbian military sources believe that at the moment the 
Bosnians most need tanks and armored vehicles (which is logical, 
in view of their offensive character), and claim that there is a 
plan for such equipment to be transported by C-5 Galaxy and 
C-141 Star-Lifter heavy transport planes either to Sarajevo 
Airport or Tuzla Airport. 
<H5>  Generals and Politicians </H5>
  Who are the commanders of the new Bosnian federal army? 
General Colonel Ante Roso started his military career in the 
French Foreign Legion, where he worked his way up to the rank of 
colonel and commander of the 2d parachute brigade. At the 
beginning of the war in Croatia he commanded the ZNG [People's 
Guard's Corps] units in Slavonia, and organized the Croatian 
guard brigade in Vukovar. He was commander of the Croatian 
special units (Zrinjski and Frankopan units), after which he 
went to Bosnia, where he became chief of the HVO Staff. 
  Later he gave up that post to General Milivoj Petkovic (then 
commander of the 113th HVO brigade). Thereafter General Roso 
was relocated to the command area of Split, where, together with 
Generals Janko Bobetko and Zeljko Tomljenovic of the Croatian 
Interior Ministry, he organized the raid on the Serbian position 
around Maslenica bridge in January last year. After that he 
returned to Bosnia, and took over the post of commander in chief 
of the HVO Staff from General Slobodan Praljak. 
  General Fikret Muslimovic is a former officer of the 
Yugoslav 
People's Army, who -- at his own request -- was demobilized 
early in 1992, but the circumstances remain unclear. On the eve 
of the war he was selling books in Bas-Carsija [Sarajevo old 
town]. Some claim it was a gesture of his determination, while 
others say it was just a camouflage covering the fact that he 
was a KOS [Counterintelligence Service] officer. As a matter of 
fact, General Muslimovic was the head of the security service of 
the then Sarajevo Corps, although he actually graduated from the 
Military Academy, which is to say, his qualifications are those 
of a "combat" officer. 
  In the BH Army he was chief of the military secret police. 
Many people believe he was involved in the affair regarding the 
removal of the former commander of the BH Army, namely General 
Sefer Halilovic, but this has never been officially confirmed. 
He enjoys President Izetbegovic's support, whereas to a lesser 
extent that of Haris Silajdzic's. Some people with whom MONITOR 
spoke believe that by his appointment as chief of the BH Army 
Izetbegovic is trying to strengthen his control over the 
military structure, because so far the top officers have always 
been more devoted to Silajdzic. 
<H5>  Strategic Direction </H5>
  General Tudjman [Croatian president] stated on Saturday that 
Croatia had no intention of extending the mandate to the blue 
helmets in the UN protection areas, which expires in September. 
The matter is probably that the revival of military efforts 
aimed at placing Krajina under the Croatian control is being 
prepared. An introduction into this is probably a possible 
escalation of the war in Bosnia, particularly the battle for the 
strategic jugular -- the northern Serbian corridor. 
  From the point of view of the Bosnian military forces, 
Izetbegovic's statement about an acceptable truce lasting two, 
rather than four months, sounds logical, since the estimates 
about the time needed for the consolidation of the Bosnian and 
the Croatian forces to be completed largely correspond to his 
demand. Still, it is believed that the task of organizing joint 
units that is awaiting the two sides, will be very difficult, 
since the existing forces do not meet the conditions necessary 
for the formation of relatively strong armored battalions -- 
which are indispensable for offensive operations. In addition, 
the lack of larger mechanized infantry units capable of 
providing adequate support to tank units while operating in 
lowlands and uplands around the northern corridor (from 
Semberija to Doboj) is very conspicuous. 
  The Serbian military circles are convinced that the basic 
strategic direction of the latest activities of the Bosnian 
forces is -- Brcko. This attitude is disclosed by several 
statements made by people in the Serbian military and political 
leadership. The Serbs have piled up an enormous force on the 
60-kilometer wide front to the south of the Sava, in the wider 
area of Brcko, but except for several artillery attacks by the 
BH Army, there has not been any real raid on Brcko. Our 
estimates say that such a raid will hardly happen, because the 
Bosnians are hardly capable of holding Brcko, if the fighting 
for the northern corridor happens to be concentrated on Brcko 
only. 
  The Bosnians have tied the Serbian forces to the Brcko 
front, and thus forced them to stretch their lines. The Bosnian 
forces are keeping up pressure on other fronts, while through 
their linear disposition of troops, their activities are still 
not disclosing the point of a key attack. As a matter of fact, 
this attack will hardly happen, if the Croats fail to guarantee 
that they will bring in the mass artillery support from the left 
bank of the Sava. However, this would involve the risk of 
possible revival of clashes in Krajina, to which a possible 
introduction may be the recent interruption of the negotiating 
process between Zagreb and Knin and Belgrade. 
  Nevertheless, it seems that the clashes going on at Mount 
Majevica at the moment have perhaps the greatest importance: 
U.S. reconnaissance planes have discovered a strengthened 
accumulation of Serbian artillery on the mountain. The news 
agencies claim that the commander of the European military 
sector south, NATO Admiral Layton Smith, has sought UNPROFOR's 
permission to attack the Serbian positions. 
  The entire matter is still so confusing, particularly 
because 
of the undefined position of the blue helmets in Bosnia, as well 
as the announcement of their possible withdrawal. Still, it is 
unlikely that the withdrawal will come about. The crisis 
regarding the issue has probably been caused by the confusing 
attitudes of the U.S. Administration. The announced partition 
of Bosnia in the form of a tripartite union does not sound 
acceptable either to the Bosnian side, or to the Serbian side, 
and that situation could possibly be resolved by an eventual 
military defeat of one of the rival armies.

  [Text] Podgorica, Yugoslavia, June 7 (AFP) -- The only 
road link between Albania and Montenegro has been closed to 
traffic for five days, a local daily reported Tuesday. The 
Albanian authorities have forbidden any vehicles from crossing 
into or out of Montenegro -- which together with Serbia forms 
rump-Yugoslavia -- at Bozaj, said Lazar Jankovic, spokesman for 
the Yugoslav Commission for Border Incidents, quoted Tuesday by 
the local daily POBJEDA. The road is open to pedestrians. 
  The Albanian authorties apparently took the action after 
Albanian truck drivers had blocked the border because, Jankovic 
said, they were "unhappy at the changing criteria imposed by 
Yugoslav customs officials." Since a total embargo was imposed 
on Yugoslavia two years ago, the Bozaj border-control post has 
become the focus of traffic in oil and other supplies for the 
Yugoslav market. Several Montenegrins were arrested recently by 
Albanians for trafficking oil, according to rumours which 
Montengrin authorities refuse to confirm. 
  PJOBEDA said it had learnt from unoffical sources that six 
policemen and a Montenegrin customs officer were being 
questioned for their role in the trafficking.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Defense Minister Safet Zhulali </F>
by Amalia Dhamo in Tirana on 7 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Announcer] A high-level military delegation led 
by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali left for the United States 
today. The delegation will visit the National Guard in South 
Carolina and will hold special meetings with high-level 
officials at the Pentagon and U.S. State Department, including 
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry. Our correspondent 
interviewed Mr. Zhulali before his departure: 
  [Dhamo] Mr. Minister, at the invitation of the National 
Guard of South Carolina you are leading a high-level military 
delegation on an official visit to the United States. What do 
you hope to achieve during this visit? 
  [Zhulali] The goal of this visit is to further strengthen 
the extremely good relations that exist between Albania and the 
United Sates in the field of defense. There is an 
infrastructure of political and economic relations between 
Albania and the United States, and we can now add relations in 
the field of defense, which were implemented with the signing of 
a memorandum and other developments between our two armies. 
  In return for the visit paid by the delegation of the 
National Guard of South Carolina and upon their invitation, we 
are visiting the United States to aquaint ourselves with their 
experiences in organization, drills -- mainly with reservists -- 
the training of noncommissioned officers, and the possibility to 
profit from them in all the activities they organize, which are 
of a wide variety. We also want to learn about the fields of 
organization and legislation. 
  My visit to the United States could be divided into two 
parts: The first part is in South Carolina and the second part, 
which constitutes, shall we say, the political part of the 
program, includes very important meetings at the Pentagon with 
political and military officials, including Defense Secretary 
William Perry, and meetings at the State Department with 
congressional representatives, senators, and various politicians. 
  I plan to inform them about the successful development of 
reform in Albania, the further consolidation of democracy, the 
close relations between Albania and the United States, the 
further support that Albania asks from the United States to 
consolidate democracy, and the progress of the reform. We will 
request the same from our military colleagues, who, seeing the 
good progress of the reform in the Army, have supported it. 
However, we think they should give more support for the 
Albanian Army, which, just like all our state structures, plays 
an important role in the peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Report from Tirana by Takis Dhiamandis] </F>
  [Text] Nothing has been happening with the Greek minority 
situation in the last few days, according to Americans who 
visited Gjirokaster to check on the charges made against a large 
number of witnesses last week. "The numbers mentioned are 
totally unverified," a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, and added: 
  "There is talk about 40, 60, or 70 people, but I only know 
about 25." The same spokesman said that what actually happened 
was that the witnesses were summoned normally and according to 
the law, except for a few cases where certain persons were 
summoned by the police. 
  These remarks give rise to reasonable questions even among 
the Albanian opposition, whose leading members claim openly that 
the shadow of some U.S. secret agencies hovers behind the 
Albanian Government's actions. 
  Commenting on [Albanian President] Sali Berisha's policy, 
Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of 
Albania, sarcastically said yesterday that "one can find many 
good things about Berisha, but ideas are not among them." He 
added: 
  "No matter how crazy Berisha might be, he cannot possibly 
act 
alone." As he explained, it is impossible for the policy of 
Berisha and the Albanian Government not to be guided by other 
foreign powers and primarily the United States. However, he 
stressed: "We should know, however, that the U.S. policy toward 
Albania is not unified. There is congressional policy, State 
Department policy, and the secret agencies' policy." 
  Pellumbi added that things in the political field recently 
seem to be changing as the U.S. Embassy is slowly approaching 
the other political parties, even the Socialist Party. 
  Leading members of other Albanian parties agree with this 
assessment by Servet Pellumbi and they also maintain that this 
means a change in the stance of Americans toward Albania. 
However, this view is not shared by a foreign diplomat in 
Tirana, who said that the Americans' opening up to all the 
Albanian parties shows precisely their determination to be 
regulators of domestic affairs in Albania--and in a broader 
sense of its foreign relations--for a long time. 
  According to a statement to a Greek correspondent by Servet 
Pellumbi, the Socialist Party of Albania insists on the path of 
dialogue with Greece and not the escalation of tension. 
Pellumbi made it clear that this position forms the basis of 
criticism that the Socialist Party of Albania makes against the 
government and President Seli Berisha on the issue of 
Greek-Albanian relations. 
  At the same time, Pellumbi expressed satisfaction at the 
cool 
and reasonable stance maintained by the Greek Government during 
the recent crisis in the two countries' relations and stressed 
in particular the fact that the Greek side did not play its card 
of Albanian immigrants as the Konstandinos Mitsotakis government 
had done in the past. He added that the latter fact had a 
favorable effect on the Albanian people and it is something 
which, as he noted, Berisha himself did not understand. 
  On the subject of the Albanian president, Pellumbi said that 
he has no cohesion in his policy whatsoever and that he seems to 
like Europe but his mind is really elsewhere. 
  However, referring to Greece, the socialist leader said that 
there are some chauvinistic circles from which he believes the 
Greek Government should be cut off and moreover that Greece 
should respect the autocephalous status of the Albanian Orthodox 
Church and not link it to the Albanian state from which it was 
already separated as of 1928. 
  Pellumbi also condemned the ugly incidents during Easter and 
stressed that "unfortunately, the two countries' governments 
became involved in them afterward." 
  In conclusion, Pellumbi stressed that until now the U.S. 
Embassy in Tirana has supported the Albanian Government's 
policy. Concerning Europe, he said that "for Berisha it 
constitutes the font in which he will be pardoned for all the 
violations of political and human rights in the name of the 
internal and external `dangers' facing Albania and which 
nevertheless are the result of the lack of capability of Berisha 
himself and his government."

<F P=106> [Report by Tirana special correspondent Marina Vikhou] </F>
  [Excerpt] In an interview with Greek correspondents, 
Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of 
Albania, said that "the U.S. policy in the case of Albania is 
not unified. The State Department follows a different policy 
from that of the CIA and the Pentagon." 
  Explaining his position, Pellumbi said that "the U.S. State 
Department initially favored the fall of the communist system as 
well as the technical support and democratization of Albania. 
At the same time, there are U.S. military interests in the 
Balkans and Europe that are separate and are expressed by the 
Pentagon." 
  Pellumbi also pointed out that "Albania is being 
strengthened 
by the United States more militarily than economically. 
However, this causes concern to the other Balkan states. The 
Socialist Party has supported from the very beginning that since 
we participate in the `Partnership for Peace' we should tell the 
people the whole truth." 
  According to the Socialist Party vice chairman, "no 
permission can be given to U.S. spy planes to use Albania as a 
base for their flights over the former Yugoslavia unless the 
Albanian people are informed in advance, unless some referendum 
is held to tell them the pros and cons of such a decision." 
  However, Pellumbi expressed his optimism that "recently the 
State Department's stand has been more positive, their 
statements are more objective. They give us to understand that 
they will defend the forces that are based on the people. The 
U.S. Embassy in Tirana has until now been unreservedly 
supporting the policy of [Albanian President Sali] Berisha. 
However, I think that with the arrival of the new ambassador in 
Tirana in September, the situations will improve." 
  Pellumbi's position on the relations between the Berisha 
regime and Europe was interesting. He noted that "the biggest 
problem facing the Albanian Government is its relations with 
Europe. 
  "Europe calls the Tirana government the `Berisha regime.' 
With the escalation of tension he applies to Greek-Albanian 
relations, Berisha wants to tell Europe `look, here are our 
country's stability and security in danger and you are dealing 
with human rights and democracy.'" [passage omitted]

  [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Foreign 
Minister Aleksa Buha said on Tuesday morning [7 May] that an 
agreement on a cessation of hostilities throughout 
Bosnia-Herzegovina might be signed at another meeting, probably 
at Sarajevo airport, rather than at the current talks in Geneva. 
This is a prediction based on the rather modest results 
produced by bilateral contacts held on Monday by U.N. envoy to 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi with Bosnia's warring Moslems, 
Serbs and Croats, Buha told TANJUG. He stressed that, in its 
latest proposal submitted to Akashi, the Bosnian Serb delegation 
had offered a cessation of hostilities for a year, whereas the 
Moslem-Croat delegation had asked for a ceasefire of between 
four and six weeks, but not longer. 
  With the widely differing positions the delegations are 
embarking on the second day of the Geneva conference and what 
they hoped late on Monday would be a meeting in plenum. Akashi 
told reporters on Monday evening that a ceasefire agreement 
might be signed on Tuesday, with luck. 
  Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic said on Monday that 
the Serb delegation was in favour of a permanent cessation of 
hostilities and was willing to endorse Akashi's plan for a 
four-month ceasefire with slight modifications. Akashi's 
spokesman Michael Williams said he expected the Geneva talks to 
end on Tuesday, but indicated they might continue if agreement 
were not reached.

  [Text] Obrenovac, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, 
chairman of the Srpska republic assembly, told Radio Obrenovac 
that "despite Mr. Akashi's great hopes and expectations that the 
agreement will be signed today," the Serb side is "nowhere 
nearly that optimistic." "This means that we will not be 
surprised if the agreement is not signed. The reasons are 
obvious -- the Croat-Muslim side has been using all means to 
obstruct the agreement," Krajisnik said. 
  "The Muslim demands are not insurmountable as far as we are 
concerned and this fact deprives them of their last trump card," 
Krajisnik said, adding that this "automatically brings into 
question any further support by those who suggested obstruction 
to them." 
  Asked about the reasons for his doubts about the successful 
outcome of the negotiations, Krajisnik recalled that similar 
indications of an early accord were seen before and that 
everyone knew how they ended up. 
  "The fact that the Muslim delegation does not include the 
military commander who should sign the agreement shows that this 
situation today resembles earlier unsuccessful attempts," 
Krajisnik said, adding that in view of this and other details 
the Serb side came to the conclusion that "they have no 
intention of signing." 
  "However, they came to Geneva for fear of condemnation by 
the 
international public. Even if they sign the agreement I doubt 
that they will respect if implemented. To put it simply, it 
seems that at this moment they believe that they can use the 
military option to achieve more favorable solution; but this 
only means a continuation of the war," Krajisnik told Radio 
Obrenovac.

  [Excerpts] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Bilateral 
consultations between Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for 
former Yugoslavia, and the heads of the warring Bosnian sides' 
delegations resumed in Geneva today. [passage omitted] 
  At about noon Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Muslim-Croat 
Federation, told reporters at the Palais des Nations that his 
delegation "insists on a one-month cease-fire." This means he 
does not accept the proposal for a four-month cessation of 
hostilities outlined by the contact group in its declaration 
issued on 13 May. 
  The delegation of the Srpska republic, headed by President 
Radovan Karadzic, met with Yasushi Akashi in the Palais des 
Nations. There have been no reports about the details of their 
consultations.

  [Text] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic president 
Radovan Karadzic says that there is a possibility of a document 
marking the end of the war being signed this afternoon in 
Geneva's Palais des Nations. Following his talks with Yasushi 
Akashi, UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic 
said at a news conference: "We have conducted difficult but 
constructive talks. Our suggestion about a general 12-month 
cease-fire was not accepted." 
  Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska republic 
assembly, 
said to a TANJUG correspondent: 
  "We expect that a document will be signed on an 
all-encompassing four-month cease-fire, but we still have to 
wait for the Muslim side's reply. Yasushi Akashi is expected to 
meet the Muslim delegation this afternoon. Afterwards, a 
plenary session may take place and, eventually, documents may be 
signed. Everything is still uncertain, though."

<F P=106> [Statement by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Federation </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Geneva; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] The talks with Butrus Butrus-Ghali were very 
interesting because Europe is celebrating D-Day, the day when it 
united itself against fascism and against Hitler. 
Unfortunately, we here in Geneva are holding talks with those 
who have started fascism, and I think the United Nations should 
draw a parallel between these two days, today and the day that 
is being celebrated in Europe -- this is very euphoric -- the 
day when all forces united against Hitler. However, they have 
allowed the Belgrade fascism to promote its ideas here in the 
heart of Europe. 
  Butrus-Ghali said that the United Nations has had many 
problems recently. Problems are appearing everywhere. Of 
course, we have stressed that this is, above all, the 
responsibility of the United Nations, which did not act 
preventively and did not stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide 
in Bosnia. They have verified and bred the virus of ethnic 
cleansing that is now spreading throughout the world. I think 
the situation is very alarming and that the United Nations must 
demonstrate consistency in Bosnia; it must stop fascism to 
somehow regain its credibility and do something in other parts 
of the world. 
  The talks are continuing. Of course, the aggressor is using 
the tactics of freezing. It wants the United Nations to protect 
the territories that it has captured as well as its trenches on 
the front lines; its soldiers are tired and are demanding to be 
replaced. However, we will not agree to that. The negotiations 
are still going on.

  [Text] Federal Deputy Prime Minister Zeljko Simic held 
talks with Yasushi Akashi, the UN secretary general's special 
envoy, in Geneva today. Here is how Deputy Prime Minister Simic 
commented on these talks in a statement for Radio-Television 
Serbia. 
  [Begin Simic recording] Mr. Yasushi Akashi is resolved to 
persevere in his post of completely objective and unbiased 
mediator -- or better yet, negotiator who is not inclined to 
give in to pressure and ultimatums of any one factor on the 
international political scene, including those who consider 
themselves to be absolute arbiters and interpreters of new 
regulations in international relations. 
  In these talks, he quite directly stressed that he was 
against employing force to solve any type of conflict and that 
he would remain a consistent advocate of all diplomatic and 
political means at his disposal for calming the malignant 
tensions in the civil and religious war in the former Yugoslav 
republic. In this respect, he also spoke about the topical 
problems between Knin and Zagreb and stressed quite openly that 
the war option would not only be hasty and precipitant, but that 
it would also be absolutely unacceptable for the international 
community. According to him, all the known problems should be 
solved in three phases: first, the establishment of a lasting 
and unconditional cease-fire; second, the revival of 
indispensable communication that would pave the way for finding 
a just, pragmatic political agreement acceptable to both sides. 
[as heard] 
  When we acquainted him with the continued efforts that the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been undertaking for 
restraining the winds of war that, due to the open and very 
dangerous aid extended to the Muslim extremists, are threatening 
to escalate into a conflict of greater proportion with 
unforeseeable consequences, Akashi retorted that, without 
Yugoslavia's active mediating role, neither the war in the 
former Yugoslavia nor the crisis on the entire Balkan peninsula 
could be solved. What is more, he added that the agreement that 
was signed in Belgrade at the initiative and under the patronage 
of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was decisive for the 
continuation of negotiations on the cease-fire and for the 
revival of the entire negotiating process. 
  We remarked that it was difficult to expect more from a 
country that is not involved in the civil war and that is, above 
all, defending its survival while burdened with the repressive 
sanctions. Akashi answered that he agreed with our assessment 
but that the international community's approach to the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia was a lot more balanced and objective 
precisely because of the policy of peace that it is conducting 
and that is absolutely transparent to all the participants, so 
he said. 
  Since the talks were joined by the chief of the UN 
Protection 
Forces [UNPROFOR] civilian sector, (De Mallo), also discussed 
were the Yugoslav delegation's serious remarks regarding the 
behavior of certain members -- or better said, certain parts of 
UNPROFOR -- and evident violations of the principles of 
objectivity and unbiased approach, which, in our opinion, could 
be extremely dangerous to the international community's fate and 
to its role in international relations. 
  It is understandable that the talks with the economic 
working 
group, headed by academician Kosta Mihajlovic, were overshadowed 
by the negotiating events that I have just discussed. According 
to the chairmen, the Yugoslav Government has taken a series of 
positive measures toward reviving the market economy. [end

  [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Special U.N. envoy for 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi on Tuesday evening started a 
new round of bilateral talks with Bosnia's warring parties after 
which he would decide whether or not to continue the Geneva 
conference on the cessation of hostilities in that war-torn 
former Yugoslav republic. 
  Visibly exhausted by futile attempts over the past five days 
to establish communication between the belligerents and create 
conditions for talks, Akashi said on Tuesday afternoon the 
conference might be continued in Sarajevo and in Pale. 
  The international mediator is currently meeting for the 
third 
time in a single day with vice-president of the Moslem-Croat 
Federation Ejup Gapic to persuade him to accept a platform on a 
four-month general ceasefire proposed by the contact group on 
Bosnia. 
  The Bosnian Serb delegation has indicated it may accept the 
platform, and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has stated 
that an agreement to that effect may be reached by the evening. 
  The start of the talks was delayed for four days because the 
Moslems claimed all armed Serbs had not left the three-kilometre 
exclusion zone around Gorazde in eastern Bosnia as set out in 
U.N. Security Council Resolution 913. 
  The Moslems on Monday attempted to seize the territory 
around 
Gorazde from which the Serbs had withdrawn, a U.N. spokesman in 
Sarajevo said on Tuesday. 
  The plenary session of the Bosnia peace talks has had to be 
postponed for three times because the Moslem-Croat delegation 
remains firm in its position that a ceasefire can be signed for 
a maximum of four to six weeks.

  [Excerpt] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Late this evening 
Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic said after yet 
another round of talks with special envoy Yasushi Akashi that 
the Muslim side wanted war and not peace. "It is also obvious 
that someone is supporting them from the outside," he pointed 
out. 
  Before leaving the UN headquarters, Karadzic said that the 
Serb delegation would remain in Geneva until tomorrow to see if 
the Muslim-Croat delegation would soften its stand according to 
which it would accept only a four-week cease-fire. [passage

  [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG)--Ejup Ganic, vice-president 
of the Bosnian Moslem-Croat Federation, retained his inflexible 
position after a third round of talks with special U.N. Envoy 
Yasushi Akashi in Geneva on Tuesday evening that the Federation 
could only accept a four-week-long ceasefire for war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Proceeding from a declaration adopted by 
the contact group on Bosnia on May 13 in Geneva, Akashi has been 
insisting on a four-month truce. 
  In Ganic's view, everything else but a four-week ceasefire 
would imply retaining the status quo from which only the Serbs 
would benefit. He also reprimanded reporters at the Palais des 
Nations for ignoring his accusations of the Serbs. 
  "I have seen all the papers and my statements are nowhere to 
be found. 
  "Today I told (U.N. Secretary-General Butrus) Butrus-Ghali 
he 
is chiefly to blame for the spreading of the ethnic cleansing 
policy in the world," said Ganic aggressively. 
  Regardless of his fervent anti-Serb campaign, Ganic is no 
longer able to hide from the reporters the simple truth that the 
conference is being undermined by the Moslem-Croat side. 
  Early in the afternoon, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
said the Serbs were prepared to accept Akashi's suggestion for a 
four-month ceasefire and that some results conducive to peace 
would be achieved in Geneva after all. More bilateral talks 
will be held in the evening.

  [Text] Geneva, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Special United Nations 
(U.N.) envoy for former Yugoslavia [words indistinct] said at 
the U.N. headquarters in Geneva late on Tuesday evening that the 
talks on a ceasefire in Bosnia-Herzegovina would continue 
tomorrow, despite great difficulties. Akashi also announced 
meetings with the Moslem-Croat delegation and with Bosnian Serb 
President Radovan Karadzic on Wednesday. This means that a 
plenary session will again not be held on Wednesday, in all 
probability. 
  Akashi confirmed to reporters that Bosnian Serbs had 
accepted 
a four-month ceasefire as proposed in a declaration adopted by 
the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13. 
The latest Moslem proposal for a ceasefire is four weeks plus 
four weeks, Akashi said, but did not elaborate on the stand of 
the U.N., which is the mediator in the peace talks, regarding 
these proposals.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Wroblewski from Washington: "Peasant </F>
Activists' Secret Diplomacy"] 
  [Text] Behind the back of the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry [MSZ], Prime Minister Pawlak is getting ready for a 
visit to the United States. The trip, to take part in a session 
of the Congress of American Polonia [KPA], is being organized by 
Franciszek Mleczko, Pawlak's adviser. The Polish Peasant Party 
is hoping to get the support of the KPA in the future 
presidential election. 
  Chairman Edward Moskal has confirmed that he invited Prime 
Minister Pawlak to come to the United States. The invitation was 
tentatively accepted during Moskal's recent visit to Poland. 
Franciszek Mleczko, adviser to the prime minister, has gone to 
Chicago. He is supposed to make preparations for the prime 
minister's visit during a KPA anniversary session in October. 
  In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, Chairman Moskal did 
not rule out that Mleczko's visit and the subsequent visit by 
Pawlak during the congress in Buffalo will be used in electoral 
political games and that they could be interpreted as KPA 
support for the extreme left wing. "That is always possible," 
Moskal said, but he immediately added: "I have been called a 
communist before, and my advice to them is to watch what they 
say when they call people communist." 
  During martial law [introduced in 1981] and the period of 
official boycott of agencies of the Polish People's Republic by 
Polonia, Chairman Moskal was accused of maintaining personal 
contacts with communist diplomats. Accusations even appeared in 
Polonia newspapers, regarding Moskal's trade ties to communists 
consuls in Chicago. 
  Mleczko is to be the main speaker at KPA's board of 
directors 
session scheduled to begin today. When Moskal was asked by 
ZYCIE WARSZAWY how he managed to reconcile Mleczko's left-wing 
views and communist past with the traditionally anticommunist 
positions taken by KPA activists, he replied: "Our forum is 
open to people of many ideologies and with different pasts." 
  Up to now, representatives from no other party have been 
invited to the congress or to the Chicago meeting of the board. 
Chairman Moskal says that this is explained by the fact that 
Mleczko is in Chicago as Prime Minister Pawlak's and the 
government's representative, not as a representative of "his 
party." Neither the embassy in Washington nor the MSZ in Warsaw 
has been officially notified about the prime minister's plans or 
Mleczko's visit. 
  In a conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY, KPA activists and 
directors, who asked to remain anonymous, expressed their 
complete surprise and concern over the intentions of the KPA 
chairman.

<F P=106> [Article by krzem, irem, PAP: "premier@urm.gov.pl; Mr. Prime </F>
Minister on Computer"] 
  [Text] If you have a computer, a telephone, and a modem 
and pay 1.5 million zlotys [Z] to open an account on the 
Internet and Z1.5 million a month in subscription fees, from 
today on you can send your opinions to Prime Minister Pawlak. 
  It will be enough to put the following address: 
premier@urm.gov.pl. You can also write it in 
English--primeminister@urm.gov.pl.--and it will reach the 
addressee as well. 
  The prime minister gave these addresses yesterday in the 
government's holiday center in Lansk, during the Forum of the 
Association for the Development of Open Systems, which was held 
in Lansk. Pawlak is the second high-ranking politician who has 
revealed his address on the Internet. The other one is U.S. 
President Bill Clinton, who made his address available on the 
Internet a year ago: president@whitehouse.gov. The first 
message Prime Minister Pawlak sent was greetings to President 
Clinton. 
  How does it work? All of the computers in the Office of the 
Council of Ministers [URM] (including the ones that are on the 
desk of the prime minister) are linked to one another by a 
so-called network. Their users can send messages to each other. 
  Yesterday, URM joined the world Internet system, a huge 
computer network that already includes 65 countries (such as the 
U.S., Canada, the countries of Western Europe, Japan, and, for 
over a year--Poland). In America, increasingly more companies 
give not only their fax numbers but also their addresses in the 
computer mail (so-called e-mail). 
  Where did the Internet come from? More than 10 years ago, 
the Pentagon tasked research institutes and armament enterprises 
with creating a system of computer communications. One 
university after another joined the system so the network became 
available to all scientists. Recently, it has even become 
available to every owner of a personal computer, a modem, and a 
telephone. 
  In Poland, the users of this network are mainly universities 
and institutes--35,000 people in 220 institutions. The 
installation costs are covered by the Scientific Research 
Committee. Other users (a few dozen, including GAZETA) must pay 
Z1.5 million to open an account in the network, and a monthly 
subscription fee of Z1.5 million. The system is installed by 
the Warsaw-based company ATM.

first six days of the strike, the plant suffered losses 
amounting to 40.78 billion zlotys [Z]. According to her, each 
subsequent day of the strike will result in further losses of 
about Z10 billion. 
  Late last night, the strike committee began talks with the 
board of the steelworks. The talks are not being conducted 
face-to-face but, rather, through mediators from the Ministry 
for Ownership Transformations. There are signs that an 
agreement can eventually be reached.

the Slovak Minority in Poland"] 
  [Text] Warsaw--An estimated 15,000-20,000 Slovaks live in 
Poland at present. But the number of those who no longer 
identify with their Slovak origin is twice as large. However, 
the Slovak minority in Poland does not represent a problem on 
the scale, for example, of the Hungarian minority in Slovakia. 
"During the reform of the entire state administration, we were 
practically left to our own devices. We do not have any rights 
guaranteed by the Constitution and a law on minorities does not 
exist in Poland," Lubomir Molitoris, secretary of the Central 
Committee of the Cultural and Social Association of Czechs and 
Slovaks in Poland, said about the present position of the Slovak 
minority in Poland. 
  Some protection is somewhat noticeable in the sphere of 
education, where a Ministry of Education decree is in force on 
the principles of minority education and maintaining a national 
identity.

<F P=106> [Article by "SAR": "A Sluggish Campaign; Not Much Time Left </F>
Before Self-Government Elections"] 
  [Text] On 19 September [date as published], local 
communities will elect 52,000 local council members. Research 
conducted so far indicates that the level of interest shown in 
the elections is not too high, especially in rural areas and 
small towns. 
  It is precisely in those areas that the deadline for 
registering electoral lists has been postponed because there 
were no volunteers to be candidates to the gmina [small 
administrative unit] councils. It seems that coalition 
politicians are showing moderate interest in the election 
campaign and that they leave its implementation up to local 
activists. Most probably they thought that they had carried out 
all possible propaganda measures for the sake of their parties 
earlier in the Sejm. On the other hand, the efforts of 
extraparliamentary right-wing parties are concentrated precisely 
on the elections and on warning the voters against an impending 
disaster which, according to those right-wing parties, a 
potential postcommunist victory would be. 
  Kazimierz M. Ujazdowski, leader of the Conservative 
Coalition, says that the left-wing program is directed against 
self-government, while a left-wing victory in the elections may 
mean a return to power of people with shameful pasts. He added 
that the main goal of the right-wing camp in the communal 
elections is to prevent postcommunist forces from taking over 
local authority in Poland and an effective fight with the 
policies of gmina socialism. These declarations are 
characteristic of the election campaign being conducted by the 
right wing. 
  Donald Tusk, deputy chairman of the opposition Freedom Union 
[UW], is less emphatic in his warnings against the dangers of 
policies of the governing coalition, and he assures that UW will 
become a party that will be able to stop state-controlled 
socialism, which is resurgent in Poland today, while, in the 
self-government elections, UW will demonstrate it can achieve 
victory instead of just declaring ideas that are correct and 
wise. 
  Janusz Korwin-Mikke, leader of the Union of Real Politics, 
has decided to present a specific program in the campaign, which 
his local council members promise to implement in the gminas in 
which they expect to score a victory. He is calling for a 
repeal of the inheritance tax [podatek spadkowy] and an 
enfranchisement of residents of communal apartments. All 
religions of the world unanimously prohibit robbing widows and 
orphans. The inheritance tax is nothing but an outright 
immorality, says Korwin-Mikke. 
  The Democratic Left Alliance, as Aleksander Kwasniewski said 
recently, wants to score electoral success through persistent 
implementation of the electoral program, which is about striving 
for political stabilization, a reform of social policies that 
entails an active battle against unemployment, and using the 
international situation for Poland's joining European 
organizations. A majority of electoral programs by parties and 
coalitions has been voicing slogans that are equally abstract 
and hardly intelligible to the voters.

  [Text] At a meeting today, the Council of Ministers is 
discussing a socioeconomic program for Poland for the next three 
years. Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of 
finance, describes the most important guidelines of the program, 
which has been given the title "The Strategy for Poland." 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] We want to dramatically step up 
the 
growth rate, finalize the macroeconomic stabilization, stabilize 
the system, and considerably improve living conditions. This is 
economic growth based mainly on investment and export expansion. 
The aim of the program is to reduce not only the rate of 
inflation but also the level of unemployment. By 1997 we want 
to reduce the unemployment level to less than 14 percent. As 
early as 1996, we want to reach a monthly inflation rate of not 
more than 1 percent, and, in 1997, we want to reduce the annual 
level of inflation to one figure. 
  The question, above all, is what is our target? We want to 
increase national income by about 22 percent over a four-year 
period. It is clear that almost all Poles should benefit from 
this rate of growth because the level of consumption will grow. 
This, I think, has gained us the support of the trade unions 
for the program. The investment capability of Polish economy 
will also increase, which, I believe, will be supported by 
business circles. 
  I am generally pleased that the Strategy for Poland is 
gaining support from both the working people and businessmen. I 
really think one can conduct an economic policy in this way, 
with support for what we want to do coming from both directions.

<F P=106> ["Text" of a "synthesis" of the "Strategy for Poland" </F>
economic development program, released by the Government Press 
Office on 7 June] 
  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jun--(1) Poland, opening up to the world, 
is continuing along its road toward democracy, toward a social 
market economy, and toward free enterprise by property sectors 
with equal rights. The distribution of the costs of 
transformation and the sharing out of their still limited 
results give rise to reservations. This is the spirit in which 
the public expressed itself during the last elections. 
Consequently, a reduction in the social costs of the reforms is 
a key issue for the government. 
  (2) Poland particularly needs a longer-term perspective 
today, a strategic conception of economic development that sets 
three objectives: rapid economic growth, institutional and 
macroeconomic stabilization, and an improved standard of living. 
That is precisely the kind of program the government is 
presenting to society, which is going to be implementing it in 
its own long-term interests. It is Strategy for Poland that 
opens a new phase of Poland's transformation. 
  (3) One of the fundamental values on which Strategy for 
Poland is based is the principle of distribution of results of 
labor through negotiation. 
  In principle, conflicts of interests in the economy occur 
between various social groups rather than between groups and the 
state or the government. The government proposes solutions that 
establish a partnerlike system of labor relations and wage 
regulation. This means a decentralized wage regulation 
mechanism based on negotiation, in which representatives of 
employers and employees conclude collective agreements, while 
the state plays the part of an arbitrator that settles disputes. 
  (4) Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the 
gross domestic product [GDP] in 1994-97 of about 22 percent; 
that is an annual average of about 5 percent (in constant 
prices). A speeding up of the current positive trends will be 
furthered through a policy of mobilizing national savings and, 
in addition, through foreign investments. An improvement in the 
efficiency of utilizing these resources will be assured through 
improved administration of the state assets, including the 
following: 
  --owner supervision exercised by the State Treasury, which 
will gain a separate institutional identity; 
  --widespread use of management contracts and agreements 
between state enterprises and tax offices; 
  --continuation of ownership transformations, including 
privatization and the State Investment Funds program. 
  Consolidation of development trends will be furthered 
through 
investment in human capital, especially in improving staff 
qualifications and employee retraining, as well as in scientific 
research and health care. 
  (5) Macroeconomic stabilization and institutional stability 
will meet the expectations of economic entities. 
  Its first aspect is the need to reduce the rate of growth of 
the public debt so that, prospectively, the debt does not exceed 
60 percent of the GDP by 2004. This will be ensured through an 
increased domestic product and mainly through successive 
reductions of the budget deficit, which should fall to about 2-3 
percent in 1997 from the level of more than 6 percent in 1992 
and approximately 4 percent in 1994. 
  The debt will also be reduced through the use of mechanisms 
that turn some of it into shares in privatized state property. 
This will also lead to an acceleration of structural changes 
and an influx of foreign investment. 
  The second aspect of the policy of macroeconomic 
stabilization is the reduction of price inflation under the 
conditions of complete liberalization of prices. The financial 
policy is directed at reducing inflation to single figures in 
1997. Reducing the rate of price increases, with a simultaneous 
policy of maintaining positive rates of interest in real terms, 
will promote a growing trend toward savings by all entities, 
stimulate investments, contribute toward growth in productivity, 
and reduce the costs of servicing the public debt. 
  The third aspect of macroeconomic stabilization is gradual 
balancing of the balance of payments and the current turnover 
account so that, in 1997, the continuing negative balance of 
this account should reach the level of 1.5 per cent of the GDP. 
  The government is consistently stabilizing the principles 
of economic play and the expectations of the entities that take 
part in it. 
  (6) Improving the standard of living is the social backbone 
of Strategy for Poland. Its successful implementation will make 
possible an increase of nearly 11 percent in the average real 
wage in 1994-97 and a perceptible increase in the purchasing 
power of the average old-age or disability pension after their 
increase by about 7 percent in real terms in 1994. The 
distribution of earnings has to guarantee for all at least an 
elementary sense of social safety, the loss of which in recent 
years has been the main cause of public frustration. 
  The government is undertaking the difficult and complex 
reform of the system of social protection that has been 
continually postponed for several years now. The realization of 
the intentions in the field of economic growth creates an 
opportunity for an effective and least painful implementation of 
this reform. 
  A program of active countermeasures against unemployment has 
been launched. Unemployment should decrease from nearly 16 
percent now to under 14 percent at the end of 1997. We are 
gradually entering a phase during which new--and often modern 
and competitive--jobs will be created more quickly than old jobs 
disappear. 
  (7) In the longer term, the international competitiveness of 
the economy is a measure of economic success and a source of 
cultural progress. Export production, as one of the forces that 
stimulate the economy and a source of financing for imports 
expenditure and efficient servicing of foreign debt, will be 
given institutional, especially financial, preferences. 
  One of the policy instruments improving the Polish 
producers' 
competitiveness will be an increased influx of foreign capital, 
especially of direct private investments. 
  (8) Poland is and always has been a part of Europe. 
Consequently, its striving for early membership in the European 
Union is natural. The realization of Strategy for Poland will 
bring us closer to this objective, especially as its direction 
is compatible with the long-term European Union program "Growth, 
Employment, Competitiveness." 
  The integrational experiences of the past three years, 
despite the financial assistance provided to Poland, have not 
been completely satisfactory. The time has come when our 
striving to participate in the European Union should be met with 
a greater opening of its markets. We, for our part, are 
intensifying adjustment activities, especially in agriculture. 
  (9) Reform of the economic center is a precondition for the 
realization of Strategy for Poland. A reform of the economic 
center will be carried out, consisting, among other things, of 
the establishment of a strong State Treasury, with a separate 
institutional identity, a Ministry of Economy, and a Ministry of 
International Economic Integration. 
  (10) Historical experiences of the countries that have 
already scored successes in the economic field clearly show that 
the sources of success were hard work by society and enlightened 
policies by those in power. 
  We also need lasting social peace. In time, the results of 
Strategy for Poland will ensure such peace themselves. Today, 
however, we also need the goodwill of all proreform forces. 
These store tremendous social energy. This has to be focused 
on creative efforts directed to the future. 
  An integral part of Strategy for Poland are 10 crucial 
programs. These are directed at specific issues and operations. 
Apart from these, the government package contains sets of 
sector and departmental programs, as well as economic and social 
policies, the implementation of which are the responsibility of 
specific ministries. By assigning specific tasks to economic 
ministries, Strategy for Poland itself focuses on the crucial 
problems and a macroeconomic and macrosocial approach.

<F P=106> [Article by Ina Boruszewska: "Council of </F>
Ministers--`Strategy for Poland'; Government Approved Kolodko's 
Economic Program"] 
  [Text] "Kolodko's Plan" envisages an increase in the 
GDP by about 22 percent over three years, a drop in inflation to 
below 10 percent, longer retirement pensions for the elderly, 
and longer education for the young. Yesterday, the government 
approved the program. 
  The strategic economic program of Grzegorz Kolodko, finance 
minister and deputy prime minister, forecasts that, within three 
years, rapid economic growth will take place and will bring 
about an improvement in living conditions. "Negotiation 
principles of the distribution of the results of labor" were 
declared as a "fundamental value" of the program. This is 
supposed to decrease the social cost of the reforms. So a 
partnershiplike salary system is being proposed through new, 
collective labor agreements that would be in accordance with 
standards of the European Union. General decisions will be made 
during sessions of the Trilateral Commission for Socioeconomic 
Issues (government-trade unions-employers), whose legal status 
is to be defined shortly. 
  Rapid economic growth should lead to an increase in the GDP 
by about 22 percent by 1997. "Mobilization of domestic savings, 
foreign investments, and efficient management of state-owned 
wealth" will be conducive to that end. For the purpose of 
managing state-owned wealth, an Agency of State Treasury 
Property is to be established, which will supervise ownership of 
state-owned enterprises transformed into Commercial Law 
companies. The National Investment Fund Program is to be 
continued, but Kolodko's program does not include a single word 
on reprivatization. A governmental draft law on reimbursements 
got stuck at the stage of "interministry negotiations." 
  To Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, macroeconomic 
stabilization 
is the most important thing. It is linked to the need to reduce 
the rate of increase of the public debt (so that it does not 
exceed 60 percent of the GDP by the year 2004) and to reduce the 
budget deficit (from 4 percent in 1994 to 2-3 percent in 1997).

<F P=106> [Article by Finance Minister Grzegorz W. Kolodko under the </F>
"Answers and Questions" rubric: "Situation Used To Be Worse"] 
  [Text] As it is opening up to the world, Poland is 
proceeding on its road to democracy, to a social market economy, 
and to the free enterprise of sectors with equal rights. To 
strengthen this process, we now need a strategic concept of 
long-term economic development. We have lacked such a concept 
for years; the economic policy, especially the financial policy, 
which was supposed to resolve only short-term problems, in fact 
resolved only some problems, while at the same time creating new 
ones. Today these problems are stacking up so much that we need 
a new complex approach. Otherwise, the achievements of the 
transformation made so far will be seriously jeopardized. 
  One might pretend that it is still possible to increase 
unemployment or the internal public debt, that all foreign 
credit can easily be accepted, and that the present system of 
social insurances does not have to be changed. It might be 
assumed that economic growth will be maintained without 
reinforcing the people's tendency to save money, that simply 
giving state property to people is the road to an 
efficiency-oriented privatization, that there are not very many 
poor people, and that all the rich people are doing nothing but 
trying to get hold of the finance minister to pay him their 
taxes. Things were and still are different from that. This is 
why we need an active economic and social policy that would 
provide a foundation for the creative work that will have to be 
done by all of us. The directions of this policy are presented 
in the Strategy for Poland, which will find its way to the Sejm 
this week. 
  We are entering a new phase of transformations. Its main 
characteristics are: lowering the social costs of the reforms, 
adding dynamism to the economy, and effecting systemic 
stabilization. An economic strategy is also necessary to make 
the growth trends lasting and balanced. To achieve this, it is 
indispensable to lengthen the period during which the economic 
policy is carried out. Transforming work relationships, 
reforming the social insurance system, mobilizing the country's 
savings, granting equal rights to all ownership sectors, 
establishing a higher level of international competitiveness, 
improving the security of the economic turnover--these are the 
key elements of such a strategy. It stresses the establishment 
and development of institutions supporting a modern and 
functional market economy. So far we have reached a paradoxical 
situation in which public opinion places greater trust in 
"Solidarity '80" and "Self-Defense" than... in private banks. 
  The people feel lost. This is because the reality is 
changing from the vision that appeared five years ago. The 
people still do not have a clear picture of their future and do 
not know the path that leads to it. Statements concerning the 
lack of a so-called third road (actually, there are more than a 
dozen) suggest only a sharp alternative: either a return to the 
rejected past or simple continuation, ostensibly leading to 
capitalism at the cost of humility and subordination to the 
wisdom of those who call the shots in both politics and finance. 
Therefore, the people need an even more credible strategy of 
development over a longer period. When one wants to resolve 
problems that have piled up over generations, he cannot rely on 
short-term programs. The lack of a strategic approach in the 
past is one of the reasons for the current difficulties. 
  However, the people, who have for some time now been most 
frequently called "the electorate," which should make them 
protest, can make evaluations. Exactly five years ago they 
proved this in the elections, which, along with the results of 
the Roundtable, gave rise to a new stage in history. It seems 
that we were able to draw the right conclusions from that--not 
only in Poland. We should bear in mind, however, that 
government policies have already been evaluated several times 
since that breakthrough--in the following elections. Such a 
perception of the Polish process of transformations will 
probably be seen in the coming self-government elections as 
well. This is what this means, particularly in the context of 
economic and social policies: 
  First, it proves a lack of approval for the method of 
transforming the economy, the excessive costs of this process, 
and the distribution of these costs. One cannot try to persuade 
oneself and others that social dissatisfaction is caused by a 
wrong perception of the people, who cannot see that the 
situation is already better. Even if that were the case, what 
counts here is the state of social awareness, and it cannot be 
underestimated. The conviction that the situation has 
deteriorated emerges in this awareness only now, which is a 
clear delay. In other words, even though the real incomes and 
the level of consumption have been on the increase recently, the 
people are still comparing their living standards over a longer 
period. It is with a certain delay that they respond to the 
deterioration or improvement of those standards. 
  Second, the process of transformations is accompanied by an 
enormous redistribution of incomes and reserves. For most people 
this means poverty, for the minority--wealth. However, everyone 
is complaining, including the greatest material beneficiaries of 
the transformations. Recently only 7 percent of the people have 
admitted that their material situation has improved over the 
past year, whereas more than 50 percent claim that it is worse 
than it used to be. Material and social facts, unlike pieces of 
bad luck, do not happen at the same time. 
  Third, the state of dissatisfaction is caused by comparing 
reality with excessively aroused expectations. Today it turns 
out that even considerable economic growth--close to 10 percent 
in 1993 and 1994--and good prospects for the future are not only 
unable to offset the nearly 20-percent decrease in the GDP 
between 1989 and 1991 but also unable to wipe out the bad 
impression that was given by false declarations concerning the 
prospect of growth after only a six-month recession, or by empty 
promises, made several times, about lowering monthly inflation 
to less than 1 percent. The authors of these irresponsible 
declarations pretend that they have not been made at all; 
however, the people have not forgotten them. One cannot forget 
that, between September 1989 and September 1993, prices 
increased 40 times, and particularly that enormous 
redistribution was made by mechanisms that have still not been 
accepted and that for many people are not even understandable. 
Only now have we been able to make a decision on decreasing the 
face value of the Polish zloty at the beginning of next year. 
This is an expression of the conviction that we will not swerve 
from the path of lowering inflation. 
  The view that in the transformations made so far it was 
possible to achieve more at a smaller cost no longer raises any 
serious doubts among independent observers and experts. The 
argument that in some other countries of the region the 
situation is worse than in Poland does not change either this 
evaluation or the conclusions resulting from it. If somewhere 
else the situation is worse, it is because the conditions are 
and were different there, and primarily because even more 
mistakes were made there, which is not a great comfort for us. 
Frankly, I do not fully understand why those who should be 
praised for their achievements and criticized for their mistakes 
keep rejecting this obvious conclusion. One must go hand in 
hand with the other, also in the future. Subjecting oneself to 
constructive criticism is an indispensable condition that offers 
a chance to avoid some potential mistakes in the future. I 
would like my presence on the hospitable pages of POLITYKA to 
serve this purpose.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] In a move that could forecast similar 
actions by other foreign oil companies investing in Poland, 
Amoco was reported in the 26 April RZECZPOSPOLITA, based on 
"unofficial sources," to be planning to withdraw from its 
agreement with the Polish Republic signed 2 October 1992 ``to 
explore and exploit'' oil and gas deposits following initial 
borings that located only ``small amounts of gas.'' The Warsaw 
daily further reported that Amoco had purchased land parcels 
south of Lodz and also in the southeast of Poland near the 
border with Ukraine for $8 million. Amoco also planned, 
according to the report, to invest a further $22 million, a fact 
that was unofficially confirmed by Polish Oil and Gas 
Engineering (PGNiG). That information was seemingly 
contradicted by Eryk Mistewicz's article in the 15 May WPROST, 
entitled ``Poland for the Poles,'' which reported that Amoco 
was ``suspending'' a much larger sum, ``several hundreds of 
millions of dollars'' worth of investments. 
  A second contract, allowing Amoco to search for methane in 
the hard-oal deposits of Upper Silesia, was, until recently, 
praised as the Ministry of Environmental Protection's ``greatest 
accomplishment.'' WPROST noted that the company ``retains the 
right to withdraw'' from the second contract, although it is not 
clear if it indeed intends to do so. WPROST asserts that Amoco 
``had planned'' to extract 5 billion cubic meters of methane 
annually, ``with reserves estimated at 1.2 trillion cubic 
meters''--which would mean an investment of $2-3 million ``in 
each of the 400-square kilometers of surface awarded in the 
concession,'' according to head geologist Michal Wilczynski. 
Sejm Deputy Radoslaw Gawlik of UW (Freedom Union) complains 
that, if Amoco withdraws from the contract, ``the losses would 
be obvious,'' forcing Poland to continue reliance on Russian 
imports, amounting to ``almost 7 billion cubic meters'' 
annually. The Upper Silesian area would also get none of the 
``ecological relief'' promised by Amoco production. 
<H5>  The Tax Exemption Issue </H5>
  ``Officially,'' Amoco representatives say one reason for 
their withdrawal is the issue of the ``all too-short'' tax 
exemption, RZECZPOSPOLITA reports, based on ``well-informed 
sources.'' The current law, dated December 1988, allows 
companies with foreign capital up to three years tax exempt 
status. The world standard for oil companies, however, is to 
allow a period of seven to 10 years before expecting a profit. 
Nor was Amoco pleased that it was not exempt from the VAT 
[value-added tax] during the exploration period. While a June 
1991 amendment to the law allowed companies formed under the 
1988 law--including Amoco--to retain their tax exempt status as 
originally granted, a new condition was added at the beginning 
of this year, forfeiting the tax exempt status of any company 
formed under the 1988 law that had not yet begun economic 
activity nor had, by 31 March 1994, conducted its first 
commercial transaction. Forfeiture could be avoided if the 
company met at least two conditions: The contribution of the 
foreign party to the statutory capital had to exceed the 
equivalent of 2 million ECU's, and the company had to either a) 
undertake its activity in regions of high unemployment, b) 
ensure implementation of new technology, or c) sell at least 20 
percent of its goods and services for export. 
  In accordance with the 1991 law, the tax relief cannot be 
higher than the value of the acquisition or the assumption of 
shares by the foreign entity. Thus, the exemption from income 
tax cannot be higher than the amount committed by the foreign 
entity to purchase the company's capital. RZECZPOSPOLITA notes 
that, on the basis of its information, there was no deviation 
from that principle. The entities now benefiting from tax 
exemptions either received them on the basis of the earlier 1988 
law or have not exceeded in tax benefits the amount of their 
capital involvement. 
<H5>  Blaming the Government </H5>
  The 15 May WPROST article viewed the Amoco situation less 
from an economic situation than from a political one, 
attributing it to a ``three-part'' ping-pong game between Amoco, 
the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection. While the ministers of finance in each of the 
governments since the agreement was signed acknowledged that 
demands for tax exempt status were valid and assured Amoco that 
``necessary decisions'' were forthcoming, Amoco ``continued to 
wait.'' WPROST further placed some of the blame for Amoco's 
departure on the resignation of Finance Minister Marek Borowski 
(a member of the Democratic Left Alliance), quoting the Amoco 
director in Poland, Karl F. Arleth, as saying the day after 
Borowski's resignation that ``we no longer felt welcome'' in 
Poland. According to WPROST, Amoco ``understood'' that ``all 
previously enacted settlements would no longer be respected'' 
and quoted Arleth that the company never expected special tax 
consideration but only ``to be treated in accordance with the 
rules of the oil business throughout the world.'' Indeed, 
WPROST reports that, while Amoco expected to ``wait a while'' 
for results, it later ``warned'' the Ministry of Environmental 
Protection that it had no intention of negotiating the 
conditions for the already signed contract ``for eternity.'' 
  WPROST asserted that ``directors of other companies have 
also 
expressed their disillusionment'' and elsewhere notes that 
``today, British Gas, Exxon, and Shell have the same problems in 
Poland and are not advancing in their work.'' An unnamed ``head 
of one of the oil comapnies represented in Poland'' is quoted as 
saying that, in both Poland and Russia, ``not much'' has 
happened, ``despite many contracts having been signed.'' 
``Everyone always wants more time,'' he said, but added that 
``after all, Poland simply does not have the number of deposits 
that Russia has.'' RZECZPOSPOLITA, in turn, notes that British 
Gas is currently drilling in the Lodz area and that ``Exxon 
Shell'' intends to drill in the area east of Poznan. 
<H5>  A General Downturn </H5>
  In addition to the small deposits located in Poland thus 
far, 
RZECZPOSPOLITA offered a less politically involved reason for 
Amoco's departure: Last year, international oil suffered a 
``serious drop'' in profits as a result of lower prices for 
crude oil. Citing FORTUNE magazine, it noted that oil companies 
around the world have dropped in the Fortune 500 list of major 
corporations, including Exxon, Elf Aquitaine, and the Spanish 
Repsol, which, RZECZPOSPOLITA noted, had also considered 
investing in Poland but decided against it. With Amoco dropping 
from 12th to 13th place in the list of leading oil companies, 
``it is very likely that, because there was little chance of 
making a big profit, Poland was simply crossed off the list.''

  [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jun--A Czech and a Slovak delegation have 
been on a visit to Poland at the invitation of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade. The purpose of both visits is to resume 
cooperation between the arms industries of Poland and the Czech 
Republic [CR], and Poland and the Slovak Republic [SR], the 
ministry's press office announced today. 
  The Czech delegation, headed by Deputy Defense Minister 
Miroslav Kalousek, includes representatives of the Army and the 
arms industry, while, from Slovakia, only representatives of the 
arms industry have come to Poland. 
  As a PAP journalist learned unofficially, the Czechs are 
particularly interested in cooperation between the aviation 
industries. Both delegations will visit manufacturing plants 
including Unimor, Radwar, Bumar Labedy, Mesko in Skarzysko 
Kamienna, and Lucznik in Radom.

  [Text] President Milan Kucan talked to Croatian President 
Franjo Tudjman in the presidential residence in Zagreb this 
morning for more than two hours. Slovene Foreign Ministry 
adviser Ida Mocilnik and Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic 
also participated in the talks. Let us listen to a report by 
Nadja Pengov: 
  [Begin recording] [Pengov] We established that the 
relations have been stagnating for a long period of time, 
President Kucan said in a statement for the public, and we had 
to ask ourselves whether this was in the vital interest of 
Slovenia and Croatia: 
  [Kucan] We have established that this is not in our interest 
and does not suit the vital interests of any of the countries, 
and that we must thus find solutions, even if they prove to be 
demanding and difficult ones. Our discussion was very frank, 
fierce, and in some points also very hard, which means that 
these problems cannot be solved by silence, without a constant 
dialogue and capability for dialogue. 
  [Pengov] We are convinced, President Kucan continued, that 
such an assessment will also be adopted by the incumbent offices 
of our states and agreed that unilateral and imposed solutions 
do not contribute toward the deepening of trust between the two 
countries. 
  The international community also does not want members who 
cannot negotiate. Some international circumstances have 
changed, Kucan continued, while we have been receiving 
discouraging news from our western neighbor [Italy]. Also: 
  [Kucan] Mr. President and I both concluded -- which makes me 
particularly happy -- that our statements and conclusions about 
the need for good relations alone are not sufficient if they are 
not followed up by concrete actions. 
  [Pengov] Now to Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman. 
There is a high degree of consensus in the views on essential 
issues despite open questions. There are no such problems in 
the relations between the countries that could not be resolved. 
  [Tudjman, in Croatian fading into Slovenian translation] 
Numerous reasons exist for our governments to accelerate the 
resolution of open and controversial problems, President Tudjman 
said and especially emphasized the importance of refraining from 
exaggeration of problems in the public. He spoke in favor of 
the relations that will help both sides. 
  In his statement he also warned of the neo-Fascists 
appetites 
for the Slovene and Croatian territories, even though he 
expressed hope that the new Italian Government will pursue its 
old policy in its relations with neighbors. He also warned of 
some tendencies for the formation of a sort of new Yugoslavia. 
  Regarding the relations between the countries, he said the 
following: There are no territorial demands, he said. The 
issue of Trdinov Vrh [Sveta Gera], Piran Bay, and the Phyrn 
highway [Sentilj-Zagreb] need to be resolved as quickly as 
possible. The economic relations must be developed on the basis 
of a deeper cooperation and we are interested in taking a joint 
path toward European integration, he said. [end recording]

  [Text] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Serb Krajina President 
Krajina Milan Martic today told the TANJUG reporter in Geneva 
that negotiations on economic issues between Croatia and the 
republic of Serb Krajina would be held on 16 and 17 June in 
Plitvice. 
  This has been agreed with the Croatian side, Martic said. 
This afternoon he talked in the Palace of Nations with special 
UN envoy Yasushi Akashi and cochairmen of the Conference on the 
Former Yugoslavia Owen and Stoltenberg. Martic said that in 
Plitvice, talks will take place on economic issues regardless of 
the unresolved political problems with Croatia. He confirmed 
that there was full solidarity between the people of the 
republic of Serb Krajina and their brethren in the republic of 
Srpska and added that the Sava corridor was of vital importance 
to them. The president of the republic of Serb Krajina also said 
that his delegation might talk to UN Secretary General 
Butrus-Ghali tomorrow in the Palace of Nations in Geneva. 
  At a later news conference, Owen and Stoltenberg described 
today's talks as a small step in the right direction and added 
that the next round of talks with the leaders of the republic of 
Serb Krajina would take place on 30 June. They did not specify 
the site or the agenda.

  [Text] Knin, June 7 (TANJUG) -- Prime minister of the 
republic of Serb Krajina Borislav Mikelic on Tuesday [7 June] 
assessed as positive the talks with a United States (U.S.) 
non-government delegation and said he was confident that its 
members would leave with quite different opinions about the Serb 
people of Krajina than they had as a result of the anti-Serb 
proganda abroad before their arrival. Mikelic met with the U.S. 
delegation in Krajina's political center of Knin on Tuesday. 
The delegation included many prominent former U.S. ambassadors 
to the United Nations, influential diplomats and representatives 
of the U.S. mass media, headed by the editor-in-chief of Time 
magazine. 
  Mikelic and national security advisor to the Krajina 
president General Mile Novakovic informed the visitors about the 
current political situation in Serb-Croat relations and about 
the genesis of the armed conflicts in the territory of former 
Yugoslavia. The purpose of this visit was to review the 
realization of the ceasefire agreement with Croatia and the 
withdrawal of forces, and the conditions, efficiency and type of 
work done by the members of the United Nations peace force in 
the field. 
  The republic of Serb Krajina was formed in 1991 in 
Serb-populated parts of former Croatia in answer to Croatia's 
secession from former Yugoslavia and attempts to reduce the Serb 
people to a national minority. Since March 1992, Krajina has 
been a U.N.-protected area, which however, did not prevent 
Croatia from attacking the area on four occasions, razing some 
twenty Serb villages and killing more than a thousand civilians. 
  The agreement on a ceasefire and separation of forces, which 
was signed by Krajina and Croatia at the Russian Embassy in 
Zagreb in late March, became effective on April 4.

  [Text] A fully constructive approach and complete openness 
has characterized the coalition negotiations today. This was 
stated by Gyula Horn at a press briefing after the talks. Ivan 
Peto also said that what was achieved is very promising. The 
two sides agreed on most issues. Kata Peli Nagy reports on 
today's coalition negotiations. 
  [Begin Peto recording] What is behind us suggests a very 
promising and effective negotiation process over the coming 
days. We thought virtually identically about the majority of 
issues. [end recording] 
  [Nagy] This is how Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of 
Free Demicrats [SZDSZ], and Gyula Horn, his Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] counterpart, assessed briefly the first round of 
government coalition negotiations this morning. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Begin Horn recording] I must say that a fully constructive 
approach and complete openness toward each other has 
characterized the talks this morning, and we were able to come 
to an agreement very quickly. Naturally, tough and long debates 
can be expected on questions of content, but we agree -- and we 
agreed on this too -- that the date for convening the National 
Assembly is a firm framework for us, to which we would like to 
adhere under all circumstances. [end recording] 
  [Nagy] This means that work in the expert committees must be 
completed by 20 June. The two sides would like to conclude the 
coalition agreement before 24 June. In this way there is a 
chance for the new government to be formed at the end of the 
month.

  [Text] According to the most recent reports, the coalition 
talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which began this morning, 
will continue on 9 June. If everything proceeds according to 
the schedule just accepted, and if the sides are able to agree 
on the details, the new Hungarian Government could be set up by 
the end of the month. Here is a report by Kata Peli-Nagy on the 
press briefing by [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn and [SZDSZ 
Chairman] Ivan Peto. 
  [Begin Horn recording] We agreed that we would set up 
experts 
committees for the purpose of coordinating, working out, and 
finalizing the individual topics. [end recording] 
  [Peli-Nagy] In accordance with the announcement made by the 
MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, Gyula Horn, the coalition 
talks begun today will be continued and the government agreement 
will be prepared in 10 committees. The MSZP and the SZDSZ each 
charged one leading expert with continuing the discussions. 
  The leaders of the working group dealing with economic 
policy 
issues are Laszlo Bekesi [MSZP] and Marton Tardos [SZDSZ]. The 
leaders of the agricultural committee are Laszlo Lakos [MSZP] 
and Pal Juhasz [SZDSZ]. Those heading the committee dealing 
with health and social issues are Pal Kovacs [MSZP] and Andrea 
Szolnoki [SZDSZ]. The leaders of the committee on cultural, 
minority, and church policy are Gyoergy Janosi [MSZP] and Gabor 
Fodor [SZDSZ]. The discussion of issues concerning public law 
and safety will be led by Zoltan Gal [MSZP] and Peter Hack 
[SZDSZ]. Ferenc Baja [MSZP] and Ferenc Wekler [SZDSZ] are 
dealing with self-government issues. Laszlo Kovacs [MSZP] and 
Istvan Szent-Ivanyi [SZDSZ] are dealing with foreign and 
security policy; Mrs Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs [MSZP], and Tamas 
Bauer [SZDSZ] are dealing with social interest coordination. 
  A separate committee will discuss the government structure, 
and it will be headed by Imre Szekeres [MSZP] and Gabor Kuncze 
[SZDSZ]. Imre Szekeres and Balint Magyar [SZDSZ] will discuss 
the coalition agreement guarantees. 
  The leaders of the committees are not the individual 
parties' 
minister-designates. The work could involve experts too. This 
was said by Gyula Horn, and then he added: 
  [Begin Horn recording] We would like the experts committees 
to schedule their work so that the first version of the 
coalition agreement will be prepared by 20 June, so that we can 
put the final touches on it, and so that it will be ready for 
signing, at the latest, by 24 June. I must say that this 
discussion was characterized by a fully constructive approach. 
We thought in a virtually identical manner concerning the great 
majority of issues. [end recording] 
  [Peto] I would also like to highlight what Gyula Horn said 
-- 
that what we have experienced indicates extremely encouraging 
and very effective talks in the future. Naturally, tough and 
long debates can be expected in the questions of content, but we 
agree -- and we agreed on this too -- that the date for 
convening the National Assembly is a firm framework for us to 
which we would like to adhere under all circumstances.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, acting parliamentary group </F>
leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Anna Dano; place 
and date not given: "It Is Not Worth It for the Power Alone -- 
What Are the Guarantees of Cooperation?"] 
  [Text] On 5 June the convention of the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] made a decision behind closed doors and gave 
authorization to the executive body to start talks on forming a 
government with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. When the 
coalition talks are completed, the SZDSZ will decide at another 
convention whether to approve the draft coalition agreement. We 
interviewed Gabor Kuncze, a leading member of the SZDSZ, on the 
conditions set by the Free Democrats. 
  [Dano] Do you still see yourself as a prime ministerial 
candidate? 
  [Kuncze] After the second round of elections, the Free 
Democrats do not have a chance to name a prime ministerial 
candidate. 
  [Dano] Were there any concrete facts in the Socialists' 
offer for negotiations? 
  [Kuncze] There were not any. However, we assume that both 
sides are open and ready to make compromises, and that they are 
thinking in terms of the whole negotiating package. Within 
this, we have to have detailed talks on the program of 
governmental cooperation and the elements of efficient 
governmental and parliamentary work, and we have to decide on 
personnel and the distribution of the ministries. 
  [Dano] Is it possible that the person filling the 
presidential post will also be discussed? 
  [Kuncze] If this issue is raised then the SZDSZ insists on 
Arpad Goncz. 
  [Dano] Do you disregard the SZDSZ's former statement that 
[MSZP Chairman] Horn's nomination for prime minister might stop 
the SZDSZ from entering the coalition? Generally, can any of 
the MSZP's offers make the SZDSZ accept Horn as prime minister? 
  [Kuncze] The SZDSZ has not yet withdrawn this statement but 
the situation is fundamentally different. The MSZP gained an 
absolute majority and we have to take this into consideration at 
our talks. 
  [Dano] Can the MSZP give guarantees for a liberal economic 
policy? 
  [Kuncze] It is not worth partaking of power for power's sake 
alone. The stake of the negotiations is whether the SZDSZ can 
receive guarantees that make it possible to implement elements 
of our ideas -- naturally, through compromises. If these 
guarantees do not exist then the SZDSZ must not enter the 
coalition because, in this situation, it would only be given 
various positions. A guarantee could be if the principle of 
majority voting cannot automatically prevail in the coalition. 
My meaning is that the SZDSZ's effective influence in the 
governmental work must not become doubtful. Therefore, at the 
negotiations, both sides will have to show a large degree of 
willingness for compromise, and empathy, and the talks will have 
to be conducted with absolute openness and goodwill. 
  [Dano] Do you think it possible that the economic ministries 
will be merged in the new government? 
  [Kuncze] The governmental structure will be an issue at the 
coalition talks. According to the SZDSZ, one person has to be 
responsible for the economic policy within the government. One 
kind of economic policy is needed, rather than three kinds that 
characterized the previous government's activities. The 
question is whether the economic top minister should be 
responsible for the economic ministry or the finance ministry. 
  [Dano] Do you insist on having one of the economic 
ministries to yourselves? 
  [Kuncze] Again, we can only answer this during the 
negotiations. The size of the MSZP's majority cannot be 
questioned. This has to be accepted and the ministries have to 
be distributed accordingly. On the other hand, the MSZP 
obviously accepts that it is only worth for the SZDSZ to enter 
into a coalition if it can also be given important ministries. 
These can also be economic ones. 
  [Dano] You mentioned that you will reconsider the 
governmental structure at the negotiations. Is it possible that 
establishing a position of deputy prime minister will be raised? 
  [Kuncze] This position might be created. If it is then the 
constitution has to be amended because this position is not in 
it. If this position is created then the deputy prime minister 
will also be responsible for the activities of other ministries, 
but he will not have the right to instruct other ministers. 
  [Dano] Do you require any of the ministries of armed forces? 
  [Kuncze] It would not be fortunate to insist on anything in 
advance. However, the SZDSZ would be capable of supervising the 
Interior Ministry. 
  [Dano] What are your views on the suggestion that the MSZP 
would subordinate the civil secret service to the Interior 
Ministry? 
  [Kuncze] Numerous versions are possible. For us it is 
inconceivable that a minister without portfolio should continue 
to be responsible for this area. However, it is not certain 
that the Interior Ministry is the best place for the secret 
service. It might be better placed in the Justice Ministry. 
  [Dano] Would you ban government party deputies questioning 
the ministers in parliament? 
  [Kuncze] This cannot be banned because this ensures the 
independence of the deputies. However, we would not like the 
government party deputies to question the ministers in 
parliament and take the opportunity away from the opposition 
deputies. Questions to ministers are the most important tool of 
the opposition. However, the government party deputies have to 
be given the opportunity to turn to the minister in a given 
situation and the minister has to be compelled to give an answer 
within a certain period of time. If the minister's reply cannot 
be accepted then the problem has to be dealt with in the 
parliamentary groups.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula </F>
Horn by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: 
"`The Parties of the Right Have Failed'"] 
  [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Mr. Horn, your serious car accident 
is quite obviously still bothering you a lot. 
  [Horn] I am much better now, even though this appliance, 
which weighs 7 kg, does create certain difficulties, 
particularly in bed. But let us talk about politics. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] What Hungary's goulash communism failed to 
accomplish in decades in power was achieved by the first freely 
elected conservative government: With their first election 
victory, the former Communists are now more popular than ever. 
  [Horn] What can be so bad about 54 percent of Hungarians 
having cast their vote in favor of us Socialists? The 
overwhelming majority of voters are salary-earners and 
employees; all in all, the election result reflects the reality 
of the structure of Hungarian society. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Does this not sound like the former Lenin 
disciple Horn, who, although he cut through the barbed wire at 
the border with Austria in 1989, thus making it possible for 
thousands of GDR refugees to leave the country, has stuck to 
socialist ideas at the same time? 
  [Horn] By asking such a question you are ruling out that man 
learns from experience. My process of rethinking did not only 
start yesterday or the day before. I was one of those who 
sought and found contacts with West European social-democratic 
parties as early as in the mid-seventies, primarily with the 
Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]. Therefore, in the 
course of the years, we went through the school of social 
democracy, studying in practice the social market economy, 
pluralist democracy, and the thinking that is guided by free 
enterprises.... 
  [DER SPIEGEL] And then you forfeited the people's trust. In 
1990 people voted against the old system without knowing the new 
one, while now the Hungarians seem to be longing for the old 
days. 
  [Horn] I do not want to rule out that our success does not 
have to be attributed in parts also to a certain longing for the 
past security people had in their lives. Yet the people do not 
want to return to state ownership or the one-party system, they 
only want competent experts now. The current government has 
speeded up our victory through its stupid policy. This is what 
highlighted the contrast between what we stood for and the 
anachronism of these politicians even more. The Hungarian right 
even tried to arouse a nostalgia for the arch-conservative 
Horthy regime instead of meeting the challenges of our time. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] You do not have any problems with turncoats 
and old single-party cliques? 
  [Horn] Of course, we also have them in Hungary. I have 
heard of people who now all of a sudden address others with 
comrade again, while only one year ago they would have protested 
against it. But any deal requires two persons. It depends on 
the party whether we will tolerate nepotism and whom we rely on 
for support. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Corruption is also widespread in Hungary. Can 
you say with a clear conscience that there were no 
irregularities in the way the assets of the former Communist 
Party were dealt with, and that you are morally legitimized to 
control these machinations? 
  [Horn] Excuse me -- the Socialist Party has given account of 
the former party assets to the very last penny. This has been 
confirmed by both the state prosecutor and the Audit Court. 
Apart from that, I can promise only one thing: We are firmly 
determined to fight mercilessly against any form of state 
corruption, and to depose from office anyone from among the 
ranks of our party who is even faintly suspected of corruption. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Four years ago the conservatives made similar 
promises; a little later the reforms got stuck. Everyday life 
became dominated by the shadow economy and Mafia-like 
structures. Is there not a danger that the Socialists could 
suffer the same fate? 
  [Horn] Despite the absolute majority, we intend to rule in a 
coalition. I am starting from the assumption that we will 
submit an offer to this effect to the Alliance of Free 
Democrats, since our programs are similar in many points. A 
social-liberal coalition might create a wide democratic basis. 
We want to enter into vivid dialogue with society, and practice 
a new political style. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will Hungary's relations with its neighbors 
change, relations that have been tense for a long time as a 
result of Hungarian minorities? 
  [Horn] What we will not change in our foreign policy is 
Hungary's Western orientation, in which I would like to give 
priority to Hungarian-German relations. Should I become prime 
minister, my first journey will probably take me to Bonn. 
Hungary's further fate will depend to a large degree on whether 
we manage to intensify relations with Germany. Moreover, we 
need a better associate membership agreement with the European 
Union [EU]. Then we must also seek a new beginning in our 
relations particularly with Romania and Slovakia, countries with 
which our problems have deteriorated regarding the Hungarian 
minorities. 
  [DER SPIEGEL] Will Budapest give the signal for further 
victories by reformist Communists in the former East bloc? 
  [Horn] I do not think that the voters in any country will 
look to their neighbors for election results. There is not a 
trend toward the left in eastern Europe; the only thing that 
matters is that the right-wing conservative parties have failed 
everywhere in this part of Europe. This should really be their 
problem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Konya, interior minister and deputy </F>
chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Jeno Balasko; 
place and date not given: "With a Free Spirit and an Open 
Heart"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Balasko] What changes do 
you see as necessary in working out the new policy of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? By this, I mean the modernity 
of Jozsef Antall's views and the presence of possible different 
desires. Can we expect theoretical-principled conflicts within 
the MDF, as well as contradictions regarding the methods? Can 
we also expect possible personal conflicts? 
  [Konya] This is a complex question. Of course, various 
demands for change, realistic or unrealistic endeavors -- 
including individual ambitions -- and a seemingly easy cure-all, 
as well as realistic proposals emerge after such a serious 
defeat. I know that the MDF should feel neither despair nor 
hope in the existence of a cure that will allow us to avoid the 
slow and tough work that is absolutely necessary for victory in 
the next elections. I declare that this is an attainable goal. 
I also declare that the MDF could benefit from its new position 
in opposition because, slowly overcoming the big social shocks, 
the MDF must become a party open to all strata of our society. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Balasko] Where is the MDF heading? 
  [Konya] The voters who probably did not vote in favor of one 
party or another out of conviction are somewhere in the center. 
Most such voters, about 30 percent, constantly fluctuate between 
various parties, depending on which group has a lesser 
aggressive effect on them both economically and rhetorically. 
We must win these people over. So, openness also means the 
widening of our support, but it also means that the the circle 
of MDF members and sympathizers should be based on a wider 
strata if possible. We can achieve all this if we get rid of 
the exaggerated ideological limitations. People who become 
paralyzed from the constant declaration of values also have a 
place among us. [passage omitted] 
  Apart from compromise, there is no other alternative for the 
MDF parliamentary faction. In order to the win the majority, we 
have to become a bourgeois center party that conducts a policy 
along national interests and is also open to every citizen, a 
party that authentically represents those we call the silent 
majority. The members of the expected government coalition have 
already signalled their intention to modify or legislate at 
least 200 laws in Parliament as soon as possible. Most people 
who are members of the MDF parliamentary faction are practical 
experts. Obviously, a pragmatism that brings a concrete 
legislative activity instead of seemingly ideological debates 
will have to be really asserted in Parliament. In the course of 
this activity, we will have to create a steady coordination and 
close daily cooperation with the other opposition factions. We 
should not play a negative role in Parliament; on the contrary: 
With the limited means of the opposition, we must endeavor to 
continue to contribute to Hungary's development and its catching 
up with the developed world.

<F P=106> [Report by Endre Hann] </F>
  [Text] On 29 May the voters gave an absolute majority to 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. The past week was noisy 
with the speculations and explanations of politicians and 
political analysts. However, after a few days, what is 
society's view on its own decision and what does it expect from 
the winners? The Median Public Opinion and Market Research 
Institute sought the answer to these question in a public 
opinion survey carried out on 1 June, which showed expectations 
in connection with the MSZP and an immense desire for a 
coalition. 
  Three days after the second round, a sweeping majority (95 
percent) of electors was aware that the MSZP had won the 
elections. The majority of people were also familiar with the 
size of the victory: Nearly one-third (30 percent) of the 
electors precisely named the proportion of mandates at 54 
percent, and one-fifth (22 percent) was almost exactly aware of 
the proportion (51-53 percent). Only 12 percent estimated the 
MSZP's result below the absolute majority, and 16 percent 
presumed a bigger majority than the actual result. 
  The absolute majority of the public was surprised by the 
final result of the elections. A significant majority of only 
the MSZP's voters (who had voted for the MSZP list on 8 May) 
claimed that they had expected such a large victory, but even 
among them, every third person admitted that he was surprised by 
the result. A similar division can also be seen in qualifying 
the MSZP's victory: As opposed to three-quarters of the MSZP 
voters, only one-quarter of the other parties' supporters 
believed that the result was "good for the country." 
  A significant section of society has great expectations, 
almost illusions, toward the MSZP government. Almost two-thirds 
of citizens expect that the Socialists will sooner or later 
increase pensions, and almost half expect wage increases, price 
reductions, and relatively quick results in solving other social 
and economic problems. Among the MSZP's voters, the proportion 
of optimists reaches the absolute majority in the case of all 
tasks. 
  At the same time, the majority of the public is thinking in 
terms of a coalition, rather than a one-party MSZP government: 
Three out of four people would like a multiparty government. 
Some 82 percent of the latter named the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] as a desirable coalition partner, and 25 
percent would also welcome the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] and 14 percent the Independent Smallholders Party in 
the new government. 
  Regardless of their party affiliations, the majority of 
people are in favor of coalition, a small difference only exists 
in the proportions: "Only" 70 percent of the MSZP voters "wish 
for a partner," while 91 percent of the SZDSZ voters believe 
that their party should be in government. 
  While society is almost united in supporting the idea of a 
coalition, it is much more divided about the most suitable 
person to become prime minister. It might not be surprising 
that, after the decline preceding the elections, [MSZP Chairman] 
Gyula Horn again enjoys the support of a relative majority, 
however, it is noteworthy that two "candidates" approach his 
popularity. It is especially interesting that [former Prime 
Minister] Miklos Nemeth still has significant support and he 
even has a slight lead over [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate] 
Gabor Kuncze. Apart from "nostalgia," this, of course, has 
other reasons, too: According to 77 percent of the people 
questioned, "it is important for the prime minister virtually to 
be an economic expert," and only 23 percent saw this as a 
negligible factor.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Albanian Parties Requesting </F>
Postponement of Census"] 
  [Text] In order to provide an objective and realistic 
implementation of the census, the government is asked, provided 
it assesses that there are objective difficulties in meeting the 
legal conditions, to undertake an urgent initiative for changing 
and supplementing the Census Law by prolonging the term set for 
the census. This was jointly requested by all Albanian 
political parties and movements in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  At their recent meeting, it was concluded that the 
representatives of the Albanian political parties address the 
president of the republic, the government, the state commission, 
as well as the expert group determined by the European Council 
to monitor the census, with the stance that a successful 
implementation of the census cannot be expected if all defects 
are not eradicated from the beginning to the end. 
  In the announcement issued from the meeting of the PDP 
[Party 
for Democratic Prosperity], the NDP [People's Democratic Party], 
and the ADS-Liberal Party (Albanian Democratic Alliance-Liberal 
Party) it is concluded that a range of important conditions for 
the implementation of the legal provisions are not being 
realized at all, while the census deadline is approaching. It 
was also assessed that a great part of the population has still 
not obtained its personal documentation necessary for the census. 
  The Albanian parties also believe that the public 
competitions for census takers and instructors are also being 
announced and organized with a delay and inappropriately, 
whereby, contrary to the legal provisions, they do not comply 
with the proportional principle of representation, according to 
the structure of the population. 
  The agreement for appropriate hiring of expert personnel at 
the Republican Bureau for Statistics from the ranks of the 
Albanian population, as an important condition for the 
fulfilling of its true function, is not being realized to any 
extent. The question regarding the interpretation of Article 30 
of the Census Law in regions where the population is not mixed, 
is once again raised. It is believed that it is unnatural for a 
census taker, a Macedonian, to unconditionally take part in such 
mixed regions, while for pure Macedonian regions the census 
takers to be exclusively Macedonians.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mirka Velinovska: "A Finger in the Hole in </F>
the Dam Wall"] 
  [Text] Although official Athens impressively insists that 
the "change in the attitude of the United States toward Greece 
on a range of questions of great importance for Greek interests" 
must not be correlated with the visit of [Greek Foreign Affairs] 
Minister Karolos Papulias to Moscow, it was not difficult, 
nevertheless, for analysts of Balkan politics to predict the 
timing of the visit, even the meeting itself. Namely, over half 
a year ago, Greece marked its reserve trump card with which it 
"threatened" its European and U.S. partners in the political 
poker game that it would start bargaining if it is left in the 
lurch. Now Greece wants to decrease the supposed suspicion in 
its intentions by emphasizing that the "relations with the 
European Union and the United States are still of greater 
priority compared to the relations with Russia," on the one 
side, and that there is a "much greater space for enhancing its 
relations with Moscow, which should not distress Washington," on 
the other. 
  One of the points of approach has been the repeated thesis 
of 
the threat or "attack against Orthodoxy and Hellenism from 
coordinated Turkish action through Skopje and Tirana, with some 
unidentified non-Balkan forces" -- as Greek Prime Minister 
Papandreou said. It is exactly in that light that we must 
observe Greece's chairing of the European Union last month and 
the expectations of the Athenian political circles that Russia, 
through its cooperation with Greece, may, in the future, 
contribute to the solution of some disputes in the southern 
Balkans -- explicitly noting Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Albania, as well as that, in 
future, a greater contribution from the Russian diplomacy is 
expected in the dispute between Greece and Turkey. Of course, 
this will be of special importance if it comes out as a serious 
part of the Greek Prime Minister's statement that the "problem 
with the name [of FYROM] will be ultimately left to the Security 
Council." Nevertheless, I take the liberty of having certain 
reserves regarding such an outcome. At least not in the form in 
which the Security Council can agree to change the name of a 
state with a resolution, particularly because two of its members 
(Russia is the one) have recognized our country by its 
constitutional name. The second matter on which we should have 
reservations is the fact that the Security Council resolutions 
are mainly not implemented and accepted by the country they are 
dedicated to. 
  One would say that everything is in its place and in 
conformity with Papandreou's policy, who obviously doubts the 
promptness of Washington in meeting his wish -- in the dispute 
with Macedonia -- and making him a national hero and a 
diplomatic winner. Evidently, the formula of Clinton's policy 
-- without winners or losers in Balkan disputes, is not a result 
desired by the old Greek fox, and therefore he reaches for his 
reserve card. 
  After the two controversial statements of the Greek prime 
minister, one after the other, given in the course of only 24 
hours, and related to the "Macedonian case," the current dispute 
has hardly become more clear. Nevertheless, while we are 
expecting [U.S. presidential envoy] Matthew Nimetz's visit to 
Skopje and Athens, and the new round of [FYROM Foreign Minister] 
Stevo Crvenkovski's discussions in New York, we are able to make 
assumptions founded on the known information: 
  1. Papandreou's statements, repeated several times, that he 
"will never recognize a state with the name of Macedonia," and 
that the "dispute is practically on the eve of a solution," only 
seem to be contradictory. We can suppose, for instance, that 
Greece will accept the Irish formula for the solution of the 
dispute, which will provide Papandreou and his government with 
an alibi for the Greek domestic public -- that he really did not 
accept a state with the name of Macedonia. In all this, the 
rest of the world will be left aside. 
  2. If we talk about finesses, we should then examine the 
tension in relations with Albania in that light. The sharp 
turns and stresses of the Albanian-Greek political dispute in 
the last two weeks can be interpreted in the light of the known 
Serbian formula: Close a problem, open another with the aim of 
distracting the attention of the people. Actually, following 
the seasoned Greek formula for conducting a national policy, 
this case is also being followed in meetings in Salonika, this 
time against Albania. The people have been allotted a new 
cut-off time, and Papandreu has been left with some breathing 
space. 
  3. The situation with Albania was strained just after the 
shock the north [FRY] and south [Greece] neighbors had after the 
informal meeting between [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov and 
[Albanian President Sali] Berisha in Podgradec [Albania] and 
Ohrid [FYROM]. Therefore, the easing of relations with one 
country causes tensions with those following the other plan, 
particularly because strategies and practical political steps 
founded on false theses have been abandoned. Moreover, if Sali 
Berisha remains consistent in his claim that the Kosovo problem 
will be solved pragmatically -- that is that the Albanian 
president has accepted the existing borders with Serbia -- it 
will be difficult for Greece to accept that relaxation in the 
southern Balkans and rejoice in it openly. 
  4. Meanwhile, following the Greek political pulse and the 
same timing, Serbia has also strained relations with Macedonia 
in the past few weeks. We have already commented on the 
statements of Serbian Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic 
regarding the recognition of Macedonia by Serbia and Montenegro, 
which are continually becoming more radicalized. Now comes the 
time for warnings from the Serbian army for the transfer of some 
watchtowers on the Macedonian-Serbian border or.... The timing 
has been set, and the threatening "or" will be enforced when the 
census in our country begins. 
  It seems that, in a range of consequentially linked 
reactions 
in the Balkans (including the reinforced Bulgarian campaign for 
proving the Bulgarian character of Macedonia, as well as of 
those "realists" who accept the "existence of Macedonianness as 
armor for the protection from alienation, but not the Macedonian 
national recognition") the key position is occupied by the 
census that has to begin in a few days. This event, always and 
everywhere considered to be an ordinary and necessary 
statistical operation, except in this region -- particularly in 
Macedonia -- is becoming a primary event for many known and 
often elaborated reasons. 
  [Text] That is why the state was expected to play a more 
active role in this act. If a party is calling on the 
Macedonian people to boycott the census and protest, if the 
operation depends on "how the wolf will count the sheep," if the 
editorial houses have received information that the political 
parties in Western Macedonia are making propaganda and 
pressuring the Macedonians to declare themselves as Serbs, if 
large groups of retired and active Serbian officers have, just 
now, chosen to come to our country for recreation and on 
week-ends, it does not look too good and it should be succeeded 
by a more serious process. 
  One must bear in mind the assessment of Defense Minister 
Vlado Popovski, transmitted by REUTER, that the increased 
activity on the Serbian-Macedonian border, and similar activity 
that is also to be expected in the south, certainly toward 
Albania, can be understood as open pressure and threats. 
Nevertheless, it can also be taken as a danger sign, indicating 
how the political leaderships of friendly Serbia and Greece view 
the solution of problems in the southern Balkans. That is 
exactly why it is necessary to follow the growing tensions with 
the neighbors and the reverberations that will certainly be felt 
in our domestic political life in the next two weeks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cooperation Through Joint Scientific </F>
Projects"] 
  [Text] Branko Crvenkovski, prime minister for Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FRYOM], yesterday 
received an Albanian Government delegation headed by the 
president of the Committee for Science and Technology, Maxim 
Konomi. 
  The meeting emphasized the satisfaction with the action 
taken 
to promote cooperation between the two countries through the 
Agreement on Scientific and Technological Cooperation that will 
be signed by Macedonian Science Minister Aslan Selmani and 
Konomi. 
  It was concluded that this agreement was very important for 
promoting cooperation in the area of science as a basis for 
cooperation in more important areas of mutual interest for the 
two countries. The possibilities for cooperation envisaged in 
the agreement open the road to bilateral and multilateral 
cooperation between the two states, as well as cooperation among 
the countries in the Balkans, Europe, and the world. Regional 
scientific projects are the main projects for which financing is 
envisaged by the European Union and the United Nations, above 
all traffic, economic, energy, information, and ecology programs. 
  Yesterday, the Albanian delegation also had a meeting with 
the president of the Macedonian Academy of Science and Arts, 
Ksente Bogoev. Interest in cooperation between the two 
academies was expressed, as well as general readiness to 
organize a meeting of the delegations of the academies in Skopje 
and Tirana. Cooperation can be also implemented by organizing a 
scientific symposium on the ecological protection of Lake Ohrid, 
which is of great significance for both countries. 
  Frederika Popovska-Pavlovska, vice president of St. Cyril 
and 
Methodius University and responsible for international 
cooperation, informed the guests from Albania about the 
organization in our universities. She expressed interest in 
cooperation at university level, and also at the level of 
particular faculties and scientific institutions, which will 
enable cooperation on the level of teaching and scientific 
personnel through joint scientific projects. Interest was also 
expressed in including the two countries in the TEMPUS and 
KOPERNIKUS programs, which involve cooperation among higher 
educational institutions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F>
correspondent Zuzana Stukovska; date and place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Stukovska] To attain a political compromise, 
European Union [EU] experts have recommended to Slovakia an 
increase in the average inflow into the old Danube River bed at 
the Gabcikovo Dam to 800 cubic meters a second. Is this 
proposal acceptable to the Slovak Government? 
  [Kukan] The EU commission's recommendation to increase the 
inflow in the old Danube River bed to 800 cubic meters a second 
is a proposal for a political solution that is not acceptable to 
the Slovak Government. We think there are a sufficient number 
of other technical measures to attain the aim put forward by 
Hungary; we are also interested in achieving an agreement on 
this. We are presenting these technical proposals and would 
like to discuss them. 
  We would like to explain to the EU that our approach to this 
issue is serious. However, its expert group's recommendation--it 
gave us a number of proposals and all were acceptable to us 
except this one, which seems to us to be a political 
solution--we reject, and we reject any political pressure to 
have it accepted. 
  [Stukovska] Obviously there will be talks with Hungary. At 
which level should they be conducted? 
  [Kukan] We are interested in continuing the talks on 
temporary water management with Hungary. You, however, know the 
current situation in Hungary: A new government is being 
constituted, a new parliament has been elected. We have certain 
positive signs that the Hungarian position might be changing. I 
am a realist and will wait and see what happens. We are having 
continuous diplomatic correspondence with the Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry. To answer your question, These talks will be 
technical talks between experts dealing with the issues linked 
to temporary water management. 
  [Stukovska] Can you tell us, at least approximately, when 
they might be held? 
  [Kukan] It depends on when a new government is formed in 
Hungary.

<F P=106> [Article by "jo, jc": "Are We Under the Control of the </F>
Russian Mafia?"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The day before yesterday, we published 
a report on the deliberations of a U.S. Senate subcommission 
that dealt with the expansion of Russian organized crime on the 
territory of the United States and the whole of Europe. As 
reported by the U.S. press, at the meeting, Federal Bureau of 
Investigations (FBI) Director Louis Freeh expressed, among other 
things, the view that the Russian mafia has already seized 
control over the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. In 
view of the steadily growing number of signals about the import 
of international organized crime to our territory, we asked 
Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner and Nikolay Trutsuk, 
councillor at the Russian Federation Embassy in Slovakia, to 
comment. 
  L. Pittner: The Slovak Ministry of Interior 
recently signed an agreement on cooperation with the Russian 
Ministry of Internal Affairs. It did so for the very reasons 
that have prompted the FBI to seek the signing of an analogous 
agreement. Indeed, there exist serious indications that the 
Russian mafia (or mafia from the republics of the former USSR) 
operates also in Slovakia. This finds its expression in 
activities such as drug-trafficking and the theft of automobiles 
and their transfer to the eastern parts of Europe and other 
areas, about which we have only signals from intelligence 
sources thus far, which makes it difficult to be more specific. 
The findings of the interior ministries of a number of 
countries show that the operation of these mafias is becoming a 
problem, with which not only the United States but also the 
whole world, in fact, will have to deal with all due 
seriousness. As for the formulation that the Russian mafia has 
seized control over Slovakia, it is, I think, too strong a term, 
which is perhaps also due to a certain "journalistic 
inventiveness." The situation cannot be characterized in that 
way. However, the existence of certain indiciations about the 
mafia's operation is a fact. 
  N. Trutsuk: First of all, I would like to object 
to the term "Russian mafia," which is being used in the local 
press more and more frequently even if the authors of the 
relevant articles usually have in mind criminal elements from 
all of the Commonwealth of Independent States republics. I am 
able to state with all responsibility that, according to our 
statistics and findings, citizens of the Russian Federation or 
of Russian nationality represent a negligible fraction of the 
foreign nationals who commit criminal activity on the territory 
of Slovakia. As regards the alleged statements by the FBI 
director, I dare claim that it is probably another journalistic 
hoax, similar to the one fabricated recently by the 
correspondent of a certain news agency about the alleged 
statement by a World Bank representative regarding the situation 
in four Slovak banks. Had some international mafia really 
seized control of Slovakia, your authorities responsible for the 
security situation in the country would have sounded the alarm a 
long time ago. If they have not, it apparently means that they 
have no reason to do so.

<F P=106> [Article by "vg": "Hungarian Civic Party: Coexistence Offer </F>
Is a Belated April Fools Joke"] 
  [Text] K. Petocz, secretary of the Hungarian Civic Party 
[MOS] for foreign relations, yesterday described as a belated 
April fools joke the Coexistence Movement's offer for the 
conclusion of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition 
without the participation of MOS leadership members on the 
common slate of candidates. "This cannot be a serious political 
gesture," he said. MOS Chairman L. Nagy assesses [Coexistence 
Chairman Miklos] Duray's movement's attitude as an attempt to 
eliminate a competitor. "It is like cutting off an athlete's 
arms and legs and putting him on the starting line," he said. 
At the same time, however, he conceded that, so far, MOS has 
not been informed through official channels of the conclusions 
of the Coexistence Republic Council's meeting [at Lucenec on 28 
May], which it knows only from media reports. According to 
Petocz, Coexistence representatives should finally start 
behaving like politicians and stop acting like offended persons. 
Otherwise, he stressed, it might happen that the Hungarian 
minority will not be represented in parliament at all. "And 
that would mean an additional 20 deputies for Meciar and the 
Slovak National Party," he said. MOS Chairman Nagy observed in 
this context that not only the Hungarian minority would be 
placed at a disadvantage in that case but also the whole of 
Slovakia, which, owing to the irresponsibility of a handful of 
people, would acquire the reputation of a country that is 
intolerant toward ethnic minorities.

within the framework of the first stage of implementing the 
Concept of Building the Army of the Slovak Republic up to the 
Year 2000. This change should be carried out this year but no 
later than next year, Major General Julius Humaj, commander of 
the Army of the Slovak Republic, told the TA SR yesterday. 
Following experience with a similar arrangement of West 
European armies, the change will mainly affect internal 
organizational structures. General Humaj described the 
formation of the Army Command as one of the mistakes made in 
drafting the concept and structure of the newly established 
Republic's armed forces.

  [Excerpts] The UN Security Council is currently considering 
introducing sanctions against the Democratic People's Republic 
of Korea. [passage omitted] 
  In connection with the Czech Republic's membership in the UN 
Security Council, Czech radio has asked Ambassador Karel 
Kovanda, our country's permanent representative to the executive 
body of the international community, what the Czech position is 
on the adoption of the sanctions. 
  [Begin Kovanda recording] The possibility of introducing 
sanctions against North Korea is a very complicated matter. On 
the one hand, the issue is that some countries do not at all 
regard sanctions as a good instrument of international politics. 
North Korea itself has said on several occasions that it would 
respond to possible sanctions as a declaration of war. One of 
the countries that never believes in sanctions and never accedes 
to them is China, which almost always abstains from each 
resolution regarding sanctions. So far, China has been very 
much against any indications of sanctions on the part of the UN 
Security Council. 
  The next development will depend on the behind-the-scene 
discussions between the Big Five, the five permanenent members. 
The main role will be played here by the United States and 
China. The side role, outside the UN Security Council, is being 
played by Japan and South Korea. I dare say that, in this 
matter, the Czech Republic will very unanimously support any 
measures to which the U.S. mission to the UN Security Council 
decides to resort. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by correspondent </F>
Lucie Weissova in Prague on 7 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Weissova] Mr. Prime Minister, in the past few 
days we were able to follow the impressive celebrations of the 
50th anniversary of the Allies' landing in Normandy. The 
celebrations were, however, not without blemishes. The greatest 
and most criticized fault was probably the failure to invite 
representatives of Russia. Is the importance of opening the 
second front overrated, at the expense of the role the USSR 
played in the war? 
  [Klaus] Look, I do not want to comment on absolutely 
everything because, if I do, I am most often criticized from all 
sides. I am, therefore, speaking with some embarrassment. 
Nevertheless, I have been living for decades in a world where I 
thought--I am overstating this slightly--that it was only the 
Red Army that fought in World War II and that the war in the 
West was only a shadow war that was utterly irrelevant with 
regard to the final result of the war. Naturally, I knew that 
this was nonsense. If, however, the impression is now being 
made that the exact opposite was true, then I am, in principle, 
against this sort of interpretation of history that swings from 
one extreme to the other. It really seems to me to be 
substantially false. [passage omitted] 
  [Weissova] On 6 June, the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] 
executive, among other things, dealt with the proposal for new 
parliamentary procedures. The ODS cabinet members have been 
authorized to try to ensure that there is no change in the 
relations between the government and parliament. According to 
you, some proposals for the new parliamentary procedure seem to 
go in this direction. Can you specify what they are? 
  [Klaus] [passage omitted] What I am really concerned about 
is 
the fact that a specific interruption has occurred in the 
interaction between the government and parliament. We have 
grown accustomed to certain methods of interaction. They became 
a habit. We have--all of us--mastered these methods to some 
extent. It seems somewhat useless to pull them down. 
  The interaction between the government and parliament is a 
process triggered by the government putting forward an idea and 
embodying it in a so-called proposal of principles for a 
particular law. This is not a fully worked out document. 
Really, it contains only rough ideas, concepts by which we tell 
ourselves and the parliament that this is probably the way and 
these are the basic outlines of the law. Parliament, 
parliamentary committees, discuss this material. The government 
then is given back the document, and the bill is then drafted on 
this basis. After this stage, the document will be submitted to 
parliament again. 
  It seems to me that this ping-pong, this interaction, is 
successful. Moreover, we have grown accustomed to it, and I 
think that it is working error free. 
  The stage of debating main ideas of a bill is now 
disappearing from the new procedures, and the government is 
being asked to submit a bill directly. This means that the 
dispute, the debate, the mutual enrichment while working on the 
bill will be missing. I consider this to be a specific 
weakening of the mutual relations between the government and 
parliament. [passage omitted]

the course of this dialogue, we explain specific matters to each 
other. I reject the claim that there is any kind of 
discontinuity. I reject the idea that up until now we have not 
talked to each other and that a D-Day will come when we will 
draw a new line and say: Czech-German dialogue is starting as of 
this moment. That is a fiction being created by individuals on 
both sides, regrettably, and I think that this kind of 
discontinuity does not exist. [passage omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Milan Uhde and Jan Kasal, chairman and deputy 
chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, met the CDU-CSU Bundestag 
foreign policy spokesman, Karl Lamers, in Prague today, too. 
They explained to the guest why it was impossible to fulfill 
the demand that the Benes Decrees [expelling Sudeten Germans 
from Czechoslovakia after World War II and confiscating their 
property] be abolished. They explained that raising and 
repeating this demand had a negative effect on Czech-German 
relations.

<F P=106> [Article by ("kp"): "The Problem of German Names of </F>
Communities in the Czech Republic Supposedly Does Not Exist"] 
  [Text] Prague--The draft treaty on easing border customs 
clearing in railway, road, and river transportation between the 
Czech Republic and Germany does not contain names of villages 
and cities, and, therefore, there is no problem with their 
German translation. RUDE PRAVO learned this from well-informed 
circles participating in the drafting of interstate treaties 
with the Federal Republic of Germany. 
  According to the RUDE PRAVO source, the planned treaty on 
state borders between the Czech Republic and the Federal 
Republic of Germany contains no names of villages or cities, 
either. However, it has transpired from the negotiations 
presently under way that the problems linked to names in other 
planned treaties have a good chance of being resolved. For 
instance, in the Czech version of the treaty on limited border 
traffic or the intergovernmental agreement on establishing 
tourist routes on the state borders, only Czech names for Czech 
communities are to be used. This also applies to the German 
version, but the German equivalent would be given in 
brackets--for example, Cheb (Eger). According to the RUDE 
PRAVO source, this might be acceptable to the Czech side. 
Originally, the Germans pushed for a solution according to 
which the Czech villages would be given German names established 
under the influence of the German historical settlement in Czech 
border regions. They wanted the Czech names of the villages to 
be given only in brackets. The Czech side has rejected this 
demand.

<F P=106> [Article by Premek Houzvicka: "The Number of Classified </F>
Facts on the Activity of the Interior Ministry Has Declined 
Since 1991"] 
  [Text] The amount of classified data on the activity of 
the Interior Ministry, to which the law on official and state 
secrets applies and which cannot therefore be published, has not 
increased over the past few years. On the contrary, their 
number has declined since 1991. For instance, information 
regarding the work and location of individual departments of the 
ministry is still being kept secret for the time being. 
  This is what Jan Subert, Interior Ministry press spokesman, 
said at a news conference yesterday. But, he added, the 
situation in the Interior Ministry's car pool (amounting to 
11,599 official cars and 7,729 passenger cars at present), 
general information on the arsenal of Interior Ministry members, 
and the management of financial funds from the state budget are 
neither secret nor top secret information. 
  "A complex report on the ministry's conduct of economic 
affairs, containing roughly 600 pages of text, has been 
presented to deputies," Deputy Interior Minister Jaroslav 
Kopriva said. "Of all this material, only about 2 percent can 
be considered secret information," he added. He also said that, 
according to him, the Interior Ministry's economic management is 
not unintelligible, but it contains a lot of individual items. 
  According to Jan Frolik, archive worker at the Interior 
Ministry, the state secrets act applies only to information, the 
classification of which is in the interest of the state. [The 
obligation not to divulge] official secrets can also be applied 
to some parts of the public administration, such as the police, 
counterintelligence, the courts, or the state attorney office. 
The Interior Ministry will also consider publishing a so-called 
white book, which should contain all information about the 
activity of the Interior Ministry that has not been declared 
secret. "The coordination of the work between the ministry and 
journalists could also improve that way," Frolik added. 
According to Frolik, publishing a white book has proved to be 
very useful in some Western countries. On the subject of 
lifting the vow of secrecy regarding various aspects of the 
Interior Ministry's work, Frolik said that it could be lifted 
during court proceedings, for example, but that does not mean 
that the person's obligation not to divulge secrets would be 
lifted in general. "This person's vow of secrecy was lifted 
only to the benefit of specific bodies," Frolik added. 
  Press Spokesman J. Subert refused to comment on the question 
of whether Czech intelligence members are active abroad at 
present.

  [Text] A news conference held in Usti nad Orlici today was 
dedicated to the alleged production of virological and 
bacteriological weapons in Techonin, East Bohemian region. Our 
correspondent Zdena Cela filed this telephone dispatch: 
  [Cela] The military Immunology and Bacteriology Research 
Institute in Techonin in Usti nad Orlici district has never 
produced, developed, or stored military bacteriological weapons. 
This is what Dr. Jiri Beran, dean of the Hradec Kralove-based 
Military Medical Academy, who is in charge of scientific work, 
told the news conference today. Development of a combat 
biological agent is, above all, a matter for top scientists in 
the sphere of gene handling and genetic engineering, Beran went 
on to say. The point is that all of the agents have been 
identified [zmapovat], and, if one wants to develop a new agent, 
a new part of a genetic information [carrier] would have to be 
inserted [in the already identified agents]. No work has ever 
been done on this subject at the Military Medical Academy. 
  Dr. Beran explained the attacks waged by CESKY DENIK in 
March 
of this year by saying that editors have little knowledge of the 
subject and are unwilling to look deeper into the problem. 
  The matter is being investigated by the Defense Ministry 
inspection team and an interministerial commission.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F>
Krejci; place and date not given: "The Decline in the Balance 
of Trade Is a Peripheral Occurrence"] 
  [Text] [Krejci] Following the government session, you 
said that the majority of economic indicators are favorable. 
However, according to the Czech Statistical Office's figures, 
the balance of trade--that means the difference between exports 
and imports--is worsening. This means that the export and 
import curves are more and more divergent. In your view, what 
has caused this occurrence? 
  [Klaus] This is merely a partial occurrence. Last year, we 
had an absolutely enormous and unexpected increase in exports, 
which far outstripped the increase in comparable countries and 
the increase in exports in Europe, where stagnation continued. 
Compared with the large increase in 1993, the figures for 1994 
are positive, it is true, but, in view of their immense starting 
point, they are far lower than last year. Moreover, the balance 
of payments and other elements of our financial, commercial, and 
other exchanges abroad--and not only as far as goods are 
concerned--are a more important indicator than the balance of 
trade. You know very well that tourism plays a major role. 
There are countries in which it is so strong--Austria, for 
example--that their imports are always greater than their 
exports. This difference is covered in the long term by income 
from tourism. So, in my opinion, it is wrong to infer any more 
far-reaching conclusions. 
  [Krejci] In this context, views are being expressed that the 
government's approach toward supporting exports should be 
changed. 
  [Klaus] We have discussed this in the government many times, 
and it is not the majority view. This involves a quest by the 
exporters, who are lobbying and going around all of our 
institutions to obtain certain further advantages for exports. 
I do not know of any export company, however, for which the 
state could in some fundamental way conjure up a place in the 
sun so that, on this basis, it can gain a foothold on world 
markets. It is primarily the company itself that must do this, 
and the role of the state in all of these matters really is just 
a peripheral and supplementary one. This is the fantasy of 
enterprises that in the past were used to something else. 
  [Krejci] The government has discussed an amendment to the 
banking law. You have said, in this context, that the matter of 
insuring bank deposits is a secondary issue that should be 
resolved only in the future. Why? 
  [Klaus] I did not say "a secondary issue." The draft 
amendment had two elements. The first concerns the extent to 
which the central bank may intervene directly in the 
independent, private commercial banks. The second concerns 
whether and how to start insuring deposits. In this connection, 
I said that we consider the issue of the banks' possible 
supervision and regulation to come first and that of insurance 
to come only second. 
  We really see no reason to stitch together a law with a hot 
needle because we had a problem with a few small banks. 
Insuring deposits is a problematic issue, because, in 
principle, it is up to the individual to decide where to deposit 
his money. This forms part of the decisionmaking of each of us, 
and the simple and guaranteed insurance of deposits would mean 
wiping out an individual's responsibility for where he has 
deposited his money. 
  Second, this would mean a massive reduction in the 
responsibility of bankers as such. For them, not only the fact 
that they lose some of their capital is a punishment. The fact 
that they cause difficulties for thousands of depositors is also 
a punishment. Such bankers are consequently written off for 
good, and they have not the slightest chance of ever again being 
able to operate in this branch. It is necessary to put extra 
pressure on bankers. That is, they behave far more 
circumspectly if they do not have the certitude of the generous 
insurance of deposits and have to strive at all costs themselves 
to bolster the finances entrusted to them. On the other hand, 
there is an undertaking to protect the citizen-saver. And, 
somewhere on the borderline between these two interests, it is 
necessary to find a perfectly balanced form of insuring deposits. 
  [Krejci] As far as supervising the Czech National Bank is 
concerned, the point was that the ownership rights of private 
people could have been infringed. What kind of guidelines 
should there be here? Where should supervision extend, and 
where should it not extend? 
  [Klaus] We do not want to infringe the rights of private 
entities. Therefore, we are a little reluctant about giving any 
extraordinary powers to the central bank. However, making money 
is something completely different from making watches or ties. 
When the tie manufacturer fails, nothing happens. When the 
money-maker fails, this has serious consequences for the whole 
of society. In this case, it is very difficult to find the 
right borderline. The fact that we have not approved the 
amendment to the banking law does not mean that we do not want 
to get tough and deal with this issue. 
  [Krejci] The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak 
People's Party [KDU-CSL] has called upon the other governing 
parties to discuss the situation within the coalition, with the 
proviso that this would involve a kind of assessment after two 
years of coalition government. How do you or the Civic 
Democratic Party [ODS] view this proposal? 
  [Klaus] If I want to conduct an assessment, I have to begin 
with myself. The KDU-CSL would do well to think about how much 
it contributes to the coalition squabbles or how much someone 
else contributes to it, inasmuch as whatever unsettles the 
public and the coalition are the issues that this party drags 
out. I would begin here, and I would not ask for a sweeping 
assessment. The ODS decided at its political board meeting that 
of course it accepts this activity by its coalition partner and 
that it will attend such meetings. Nevertheless, it itself will 
not prepare any written material on this subject in advance. We 
do not feel the need for such an assessment, and, moreover, we 
feel that improving relations within the coalition does not 
depend on whether we put something down on paper. That is to 
say, I do not know how such a paper can erect a dam against the 
various utterings of the gentlemen deputies from the Civic 
Democratic Alliance, the KDU-CSL, or the Christian Democratic 
Party.

"Presidential Campaign; Loneliness of a Long-Distance Runner"] 
  [Text] Lech Walesa has announced that he will run in 
next year's presidential election. Why did he do it so soon? 
  It could be just an accident. The journalists asked, so he 
replied. The president is an impulsive man; he likes fast 
responses.... But he is also capable of waiting. He has proved 
that many times, like in the 1980's, for instance. So one could 
assume that his statement to PAP was made deliberately. 
<H5>  Candidates' Worries </H5>
  Walesa has to start off his campaign very early. An enormous 
amount of work is ahead of him. A year and a half before the 
elections, he has neither political backing nor popularity. 
Without appropriate structures, he will not be able to collect 
money or organize rallies or put up posters.... He will not win 
without the electorate's support. He needs time to bounce off 
the bottom. 
  Aleksander Kwasniewski, who is leading in presidential 
popularity polls, has a completely different worry on his mind: 
His problem is to maintain the popularity and not to allow the 
voters to get bored with him. That is why he is dragging his 
feet, and he does not want to begin the campaign yet. 
<H5>  Stocktaking of Supporters </H5>
  By announcing his decision, Walesa is trying to force 
Kwasniewski and other competitors to disclose their 
intentions...and to make mistakes. After all, the candidates 
will be under the particularly watchful eye of the mass media 
and the voters. Currently, it is the president's blunders that 
get the biggest publicity. 
  Walesa also most probably wants to conduct a "stocktaking" 
of 
his supporters. He wants to check whether he can count on the 
support of someone else apart from the Non-Party Bloc in Support 
of Reforms. 
  True, it is known widely that he has supporters in different 
parties (for instance, the Christian-National Union, the Peasant 
Accord, and Solidarity), but it is also known that these 
supporters are few and far between. Perhaps by submitting his 
candidacy the president wants to force them to be more active. 
He is probably thinking: "Even if they fail to win their 
parties for me, they could at least prevent them from coming up 
with countercandidates." 
<H5>  He Abuses People and Then He Dumps Them </H5>
  Do such tactics have a chance of being successful? For the 
moment, rather not. Unfriendly feelings toward Walesa within 
the post-Solidarity camp are just too high. He is regarded as a 
high-risk investment, as a politician who "abuses people and 
then dumps them." A right-wing leader recently compared the 
president to a coachman who, while fleeing to escape wolves, is 
giving more and more of his passengers to the prey of the 
wolves, one by one. Is it any wonder that nobody wants to ride 
Walesa's coach? 
  The style of his presidency--that is, the policy of constant 
"wars at the top"--also arouses enormous reservations. If 
Walesa wants to dream of a big political camp, he must change 
his style. And perhaps he also must change the composition of 
his chancellery. But will he agree to sacrifice [presidential 
aide] Mieczyslaw Wachowski in return for his reelection? And 
will that be enough? 
<H5>  Directly to Voters </H5>
  If the parties turn their backs on Walesa, he will address 
the electorate directly. He will tour Poland, he will organize 
rallies. He feels best as a people's tribune. Nobody talks to 
crowds better than he. 
  He will definitely not give up on television, either. He 
will be launching attacks on the National Radio and Television 
Council and [Television Chairman] Wieslaw Walendziak. He will 
try to replace them or to force them to be obedient. 
  The campaign of a lonely Walesa will be more populist. It 
will definitely be anticommunist. But will it also be 
antimarket? So far, two slogans have been hanging above the 
president's bed: First of all Walesa, and second of 
all--capitalism.

  [Excerpt] Top-level Slovene-Croat talks have been held in 
the Presidential Palace in Zagreb. The presidents of the two 
countries, Franjo Tudjman and his guest Milan Kucan, who arrived 
this morning for a working visit to Croatia, made brief 
statements following their talks. The Slovene president's visit 
to Zagreb is being covered by Andjelko Perincic: 
  [Perincic] Speaking to the press, President Kucan described 
the talks as tough, polemic, and open but imbued with mutual 
understanding nevertheless. 
  [Begin Kucan recording, in Slovene with superimposed 
Serbo-Croatian translation] I believe, as the talks 
demonstrated, that unilateral solutions do not facilitate mutual 
understanding and the development of mutual trust between the 
two countries. The talks were held under different 
circumstances from those surrounding the process of securing 
Slovene and Croatian independence when there were intense 
contacts. [end recording] 
  Kucan also said life demands solutions to problems and the 
establishment of new political relations can be endorsed only by 
concrete steps. Croatian President Franjo Tudjman also spoke to 
the press. 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] Many international factors prompt 
both Croatia and Slovenia to coordinate their policies. The 
rise of neofascist claims in today's Italy against Slovene and 
Croatian territory explicitly point to this. Understandably, we 
hope the Italian Government will continue the democratic 
policies pursued by the previous governments and the policy of 
friendly relations with our countries. At the same time we must 
not ignore those forces that are openly extolling fascism, 
including everything this fascism brought about on the soil of 
Slovenia and Croatia. [end recording] [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F>
unidentified correspondent; date and place not given; Kucan 
speaks in Slovene with superimposed Serbo-Croatian translation 
-- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Mr. President, your visit to 
Croatia and your talks with President Tudjman are taking place 
at a time when Croatian-Slovene relations have been assuming 
more positive forms. Can you compare the state of relations 
between the two countries at a time of their struggle for 
independence, and today when these relations are not as idyllic 
as they used to be four years ago? 
  [Kucan] I cannot see much improvement in our relations. They 
are simply stagnating. This is a bad thing and does not reflect 
the fact that we are two countries. It does not reflect our 
interests and is far below the level of both countries' vital 
interests. It is true, as you say, that our relations had a far 
more glittering past, which was more beneficial to both 
countries. This was at the time of dissociation and our nascent 
independence when the two countries set their standards of 
international conduct. These standards were based on the 
realization that a peaceful way was needed, that arguments were 
needed, as well as respect for others, that dialogue was needed. 
All of this facilitates coexistence once it has been 
established that living together in a shared state is no longer 
possible. At that time, by these standards, both countries 
established their recognizable individuality in international 
relations. They managed to prove the fundamental validity of 
their decision to exercise their right to self-determination. 
It is then justifiable to ask: Why are they not capable now 
of meeting these same standards in their mutual relations? Why 
has their will decreased? Why do they not find the resolution 
of these issues a priority? Why do they rather find priorities 
elsewhere? To some extent we can justify and understand this as 
a result of the different circumstances surrounding Slovenia, as 
opposed to those surrounding Croatia. Given both countries' 
ambitions, I am referring to their European ambitions. It is 
nevertheless a short-sighted view that the issue of mutual 
relations are not a priority. Countries that are incapable of 
resolving their shared issues along European criteria -- without 
creating difficulties for others and without shifting their 
responsibility to others -- will not be welcomed by the family 
of European nations. 
  Among other things, this demonstrates the need to establish 
first, whether there is a political will to really start 
resolving these problems. In other words, this is not a matter 
of parading a nonexistent idyll which is of no use to anyone, 
but the realization of the true gravity and importance of these 
problems, which must be geared to resolving conditions along the 
border. This is something which directly affects peoples' lives. 
  In this context, the economic sphere must also be mentioned, 
as it directly affects the quality of life in both countries. 
My principal task during my visit to Zagreb is to find out 
whether there is such a will on the part of Croatia, something 
that, in my view, is impossible to do without talking to Mr. 
Tudjman. 
  [Correspondent] I will mention some outstanding issues: the 
state border, the Ljubljanska Bank, Krsko nuclear power plant, 
property relations. In your view, how much are these issues an 
expression of the real state of affairs, and how much is there a 
need for both countries to confirm their internationally 
recognized independence on these issues? 
  [Kucan] Unfortunately, the reality does not allow a strict 
separation of internal and foreign policies. One is in the 
service of the other. Each democratic and wise policy has to 
take into consideration not only the affirmation of the state in 
the first place, but also whether it is able to organize life in 
the state in a bearable way, and whether it is able to organize 
it in such a way that it does not infringe on the equal rights 
of other states and other nations. 
  The problems that you have just mentioned have been 
inherited 
from our life in the former Yugoslav state. In part we are able 
to resolve them through bilateral talks and negotiations; in 
part they need to be settled, for principled reasons, within the 
framework of the succession of the former common state. We 
should not forget that part of the succession issue is in 
connection with other states that have been created, or are 
being created, on the territory of former Yugoslavia. I would 
not set them out as a condition, that only after these issues 
have been resolved -- even though I am not underestimating their 
seriousness -- it would be possible to resolve other issues. 
  The biggest difficulty for Croatia and Slovenia is the 
decline in economic cooperation. As regards Slovene exports, 
Croatia is the third economic partner, and as regards imports it 
is in fourth place, and is declining. Unfortunately, this trend 
is continuing this year. We can partially justify it with the 
fact that Croatia lives somewhat according to the logic of a war 
economy. However, that is not the right answer. Property 
issues have not been settled, in addition to a series of other 
things, which in the long run -- at a time when the situation in 
the Balkans went this way -- are falling to a completely 
different level of economic exchange [as heard]. This huge 
decline does not just represent a decline in quantity, but also 
a decline in the quality of relations. 
  Slovenia has concluded agreements on free trade with 
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and an agreement with 
Poland is being prepared, and as regards the option of 
concluding such an agreement with Austria -- given its specific 
nature because of Austria's admission soon into the European 
Union -- we are thinking about Austria and Croatia. We have 
only signed a declaration on reaching such an agreement. This 
is not to mention those that need to be signed, such as the 
avoidance of double taxation, an agreement on securing 
investments, which would show good will and an understanding of 
how much our economies are linked. But for the time being we 
have not talked about it. [passage omitted] 
  The problems of transition are very complex. Everyone is 
solving them in line with their specific conditions; what 
everyone has achieved as regards long-term and wise results. 
The only way in which it is possible to look at these problems 
is that each result would have to be a success for all of us. 
Otherwise, Europe will remain divided, and not just 
politically. It will also be divided into its developed and 
underdeveloped economic parts. This is precisely where Croatia 
and Slovenia should ask themselves where they will find a place 
in that division, and how much they themselves will be to blame 
if they remain behind the border signifying the economically 
underdeveloped part of Europe. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Slovene and Croatian politicians agree that 
good-neighborly relations require respect for the interests of 
both sides. To what extent is this commitment being influenced 
by some radical views held by a certain part of Slovenia's 
political public? Can they decisively interfere in the creation 
of far more positive relations between Slovenia and Croatia? 
  [Kucan] Individual radical views certainly do not contribute 
toward better relations. They do not contribute toward the 
belief that there is a will to regulate mutual relations, such 
mutual relations that are based on the equality of both states, 
on recognition of the principle of justice and mutual benefits 
in resolving the most sensitive and disputed issues, such as 
those you have already mentioned. 
  However, an integral part of pluralism and democracy is the 
peoples' right to express their views and opinions, including 
the most extremist and most radical ones. The question of state 
policies is whether to accept these as a fact or to oppose such 
extremist views with the arguments that a state policy must 
have. To base a policy on extremist views is, of course, a 
short-sighted thing. So is basing a state's approach to another 
state on extremist standpoints. The real force that can change 
the current strained relations between Croatia and Slovenia is 
certainly not in the hands of extremists. The real power in 
Croatia is in the hands of the legitimate bodies of government 
and parliament, and President Tudjman. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] As far as European integration processes are 
concerned, we must of course mention relations between Italy, 
Slovenia, and Croatia, and the Ossimo agreement. Certain 
political circles in Italy want the agreement to be revised. 
Can such demands change the EU's [European Union] basic 
criteria, which are vital for democracy in the EU and all other 
states, and can they change the EU's relations with Slovenia and 
Croatia. 
  [Kucan] Slovenia, Croatia, and the entire democratic Europe 
are justifiably worried by the outcome of the Italian elections. 
My opinion is that the outcome is an expression of the will of 
the people of the Republic of Italy. Therefore, this is a fact 
which we have to accept and respect. What will be the policy of 
the Italian coalition government, including the neo-fascists? 
This will be reflected in the government's standpoints and in 
its specific measures to implement them. This is the only 
relevant thing when making a political judgment. We base our 
standpoint solely on this. Any prejudged condemnation or 
suspicion would be a sign of immaturity in international 
relations. It is true that Italy has blocked Slovenia's 
participation in the east-west group negotiations in Warsaw. It 
is true that it has prevented Slovenia from being one of the 
nine states discussing a stability pact in Paris. I hope that 
it will not use its veto to prevent Slovene negotiations with 
the EU. 
  All these things require an adequate response once they have 
taken place, a response based on European principles, on the 
principles which the EU complies with, primarily on the 
principles of the Helsinki and the Paris declaration, which are 
the mainstay of the CSCE. 
  Our relations with Italy are formally regulated under the 
Ossimo treaty. Slovenia insists on being a successor to this 
treaty, while the Italian Parliament has recognized this. This 
does not mean that all our relations are regulated or that they 
are regulated in the best possible way. It is 10 years since 
these agreements were signed. 
  Some problems which have not been resolved by these 
agreements or which could be solved better, require good will, 
mutual trust, and, just like in relations with Croatia, justice 
and mutual benefits. We cannot tolerate a situation in which 
unresolved bilateral relations are used as blackmail, for 
instance as an obstacle, a condition attached to Slovenia's 
participation in multilateral relations. I do not believe that 
the EU will tolerate this, either. 
  As far as fascism is concerned, Slovenia is totally 
explicit in this respect. Some xenophobic and fascist-style 
phenomena in Slovenia must be met with condemnation on the part 
of the democratic public. The Slovene people must be aware that 
in World War II they were on the side of the victorious 
anti-fascist coalition. It is precisely today that the 50th 
anniversary of the invasion is being celebrated. Regrettably, 
Slovenia has been unjustly left out. Slovenia is not there. 
However, regardless of this, Slovenia's position during World 
War II in the anti-fascist coalition is the Slovene people's 
most convincing historic argument in Slovenia's international 
relations. 
  [Correspondent] As far as the area of former Yugoslavia is 
concerned, the question inevitably arises of resolving the 
Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in 
Croatia. What is your view of the Washington agreement? In your 
opinion, does it mark the real beginning of the end of the war 
in this region? 
  [Kucan] First, I would like to say that everything that is 
going on now is a matter of redressing some initial mistakes and 
some initial underestimation of the gravity of the reasons 
behind, first the Yugoslav, and now the Balkan crisis. I 
believe that as yet no one has a realistic notion of how to 
solve this crisis as a whole, and of how to turn the Balkans, as 
an area of permanent instability, into an area of relative 
stability -- relative in terms of today's stability in Europe. 
  Every contribution, of course, which replaces the military 
framework of the conflict with a diplomatic search for a 
solution is welcome and worthy of every effort. From this 
viewpoint the Washington agreement is also a precious 
contribution toward ending the war. On the other hand, it shows 
the futility and absurdity of the military conflict between the 
Croats and Muslims. In my view, the most damaging consequence 
of this conflict is the fact that it obscured the true nature of 
the conflict, that it obscured the identity of the aggressor and 
what its ambitions were in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  You see, the world is not talking about a war waged against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, but about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 
other words, it is talking about a civil war, something that is 
a far easier issue in terms for international politics. Such a 
policy inflicted a great deal of damage on Croatia, in 
particular. 
  During my international meetings and talks, I have been 
protesting against attempts at putting an equals sign between 
Croatia and Serbia, and their respective motives, ambitions, and 
goals. I particularly protested, not very long ago, when 
sanctions against Croatia were being discussed. From this 
viewpoint, healthy relations between Croatia and Slovenia would 
considerably reduce this risk. Hence, the Washington agreement 
is a very important step, but I cannot see it as the last move 
in resolving the crisis. 
  [Correspondent] The Washington agreement mentions the 
possibility of setting up a confederation between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and Croatia. Is a new Yugoslav 
integration possible in this area? 
  [Kucan] No. A confederation between the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation and Croatia is possible, should both countries be 
interested in it, be genuinely interested in it, not giving in 
to the imposed interests of some other states that wish to 
simplify the situation and change the acute phase of the 
conflict into a latent one, with the possibility of this latent 
phase becoming an acute one again. 
  I cannot see any fundamental reasons or arguments for the 
recreation of a Yugoslav federation, confederation, or 
association, at least as regards Slovenia. Should it suit other 
countries that were created or are being created on the 
territory of former Yugoslavia, Slovenia will raise no 
objections. That is for them to decide. 
  Slovenia is, by its spiritual, cultural, and civilizational 
tradition, a central European state. It has European ambitions, 
as I have already mentioned. They cannot be realized in a 
package, or with the states of the former Yugoslavia, or with 
the states of the Visegrad group with which we have developed 
good cooperation, or with a central European group, but through 
gradually fulfilling conditions set forth as criteria for making 
a decision on whether Slovenia fulfils conditions for being 
admitted to the European Union. Slovenia is immensely 
interested in cooperating with all states, primarily with its 
neighbors, with states in central Europe, and also with the 
states of former Yugoslavia, according to the circumstances, 
when the war stops there, when the process of transition starts, 
and when they display the will for joining the European 
integrations. 
  As part of the search for solutions to the Balkan crisis, 
all 
these states need to be given the opportunity to seek prospects 
in Europe. Their isolation will serve to exacerbate the crisis, 
and will do nothing for the stability of the region. 
  So, the quality of relations is not to be found in the 
nature 
of the association, but is the result of objectively formulated 
interests and the possibility of realizing these interests on 
the basis of equality and mutual benefit. In other words, the 
nature of relations will differ considerably from relations in 
the former common state. They will in no way be different from 
the nature of Slovenia's relations with other states. This is 
where our prospects are, and it has nothing to do with any 
institutional links with the states emerging on the territory of 
former Yugoslavia, or whether it suits others or not. Slovenia 
will not oppose any attempt to set up something that is or was 
similar to the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Correspondent] According to information at our disposal, 
or rather, according to reports by the Slovene press, there will 
be no meeting with President Tudjman on the one hand, but on the 
other you will meet with President Tudjman [as heard]. How much 
would this meeting contribute toward the efforts to more 
speedily resolve the existing problems between Croatia and 
Slovenia? 
  [Kucan] My view is that it is not up to the presidents to 
tackle specific problems. They must ascertain if there is a 
political will in both states to resolve the problems of 
bilateral cooperation. It is sad that there has been no 
dialogue between us for almost 20 months, despite our agreement 
on the need for annual meetings. It is also sad that there has 
been no dialogue at a governmental level. This could lead to 
the conclusion that, in fact, there is no interest or firm 
strategy, or idea of what importance both Ljubljana and Zagreb 
attach to relations between the two states. 
  Responsibility for the failure to tackle issues cannot be 
laid squarely with one side. Each side must be made aware of 
its responsibilities. If this was the case, a cement mixer at 
the border crossing in Plovanija would not be of vital 
importance for determining the nature of the relations, or for 
resolving the problems, and for whether we are prepared to 
resolve them or not. It should not depend on this whether or 
note I meet with President Tudjman. 
  In other words, under Slovenia's constitutional order, it 
was 
normal for me to ask the Foreign Ministry whether, in such 
circumstances, we should accept the invitation. The Foreign 
Ministry replied affirmatively. After that, and in view of the 
unilateral move inside the disputed territory -- and this 
territory is disputed because Slovenia believes firmly that it 
is its own -- it was necessary to get the Slovene Government's 
view. The Government judged the reply by Croatian Prime 
Minister Valentic as satisfactory, and that the construction 
work had been discontinued. This was a good reason for testing 
Zagreb's interests and willingness to cement our relations, and 
to intensify efforts to resolve our bilateral relations. 
  This is the main task of my visit. This is a working and not 
a protocol visit. Ahead of me are extensive talks with 
President Tudjman. As far as I know, he also thinks that time 
is not the main reason behind the talks, but a need for a 
profound exchange of views and arguments. I expect us to reach 
the common conclusion that unilateral moves are not the way 
toward finding solutions. Sound relations, in particular in the 
economic sphere, and increased cooperation provide the framework 
for resolving the problems much easier. However, isolated 
problems and insistance on tackling them alone reflect a lack of 
desire to resolve other problems. To what extent such views are 
wrong and fateful, that is something I have spoken about before. 
  [Correspondent] Mr. President, thank you for the interview.

  [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac returned home this 
evening from Great Britain and France, where he took part in the 
50th anniversary celebrations of the Allied landings in Normandy. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. 
President, 
the purpose of your visit was, above all, to honor the memory of 
those who fell during the historical event of the Normandy 
invasion. However, how do you assess the importance of this 
visit and your meetings with many important politicians from the 
foreign policy angle? 
  [Kovac] It was an opportunity to establish personal contact 
with a whole range of state representatives, mainly with those I 
had not met until now. [passage omitted] Of course, it was also 
an opportunity to deepen still further those contacts that 
already exist. I have in mind the meeting with President Bill 
Clinton. I had the opportunity to listen to their interest in 
Slovakia. They wanted to know what is happening in Slovakia. 
They expressed an understanding of our policy. They were 
interested to see the continuation of the Slovak transformation, 
of building friendly relations with neighboring states, and they 
want Slovakia to contribute toward the stability of the Central 
European region. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Cvijetin Milivojevic: "Is Karadzic Milosevic's </F>
Rival?"] 
  [Text] If it is the political elimination of Slobodan 
Milosevic to which Bill Clinton referred while speaking about 
necessary changes in Serbia, the Serbian opposition should 
really be concerned about its chances to win in the possible 
early elections. So-called well-informed circles have connected 
the attitude of the U.S. President with the alleged statement by 
a high official of the government in Pale, who, according to the 
same source, said that it would best if Milosevic withdrew and 
gave up the function to a politician like, for instance, Zoran 
Djindjic or Vojislav Kostunica. 
  With these speculations about possible "castling" in the 
leadership of the greatest of all Serbian states the proposal 
made by the cochairman of the London conference on former 
Yugoslavia, namely Lord David Owen, could easily fit in as well, 
since he asked [former FRY President] Dobrica Cosic in a way to 
return to public (political) life, for that would give an 
impetus to the peace process. 
  Until now, the Serbian opposition has, as a rule, clung to 
any unfavorable remark by the West addressed to the current 
president, seeking in it indirect support of the great world 
powers for its own political attitudes. This time, however, the 
greatest part of the opposition has passed over in silence 
Clinton's position on lifting the international blockade against 
the FRY. Moreover, the chairman of the Democratic Party has 
demanded from the ruling parties in Serbia and Montenegro that 
the key positions in the federal state be occupied by the most 
powerful among the Montenegrin and Serbian socialists, which 
also suggests Milosevic's moving in the Palace of Federation. 
  However, even more indicative is the statement made by 
Radovan Karadzic, whom the nationalistic part of the Serbian and 
Montenegrin opposition considers to be Milosevic's only serious 
rival in some imaginary all-Serbian elections. Last weekend the 
leader of the Bosnian Serbs diplomatically said that nobody 
would deny any opportunity to Milosevic even to formally become 
the leader of all Serbian states. The chairman of the Serbian 
Democratic Party [SDS] of the Serbian states is obviously 
realistic in estimating his own chances in a political match 
against Milosevic, but the very fact that the state-run 
television ignored Karadzic's performances in Subotica and Novi 
Sad speaks enough for how bothersome a riddle Karadzic is for 
the Serbian socialists. 
  Undoubtedly, Karadzic's efforts are aimed at long term 
effects. In the international public he is presenting himself as 
a peacemaker, imitating Milosevic's turn toward peace, and just 
like the president of Serbia, whenever he negotiates a strategic 
withdrawal or unpopular surrender of territories in Bosnia, he 
pushes his aides in the focus of attention. 
  On the inter-Serbian plane the president of the republic of 
Srpska mobilizes the nationalistic opposition bloc that, under 
the deceitful disguise of the SDS, is spreading more and more, 
annihilating the monopoly of the Socialist Party of Serbia 
[SPS]. The socialists have also felt this danger, and therefore 
they are announcing the foundation of the SPS of all the Serbian 
states, which could take place as early as on the holiday of 
Vidovdan [28 June]. Karadzic's party platform (SDS as a 
tranquilizing and stabilizing force whose only ideology is the 
welfare of the Serbian people and all those who remain to live 
in the Serbian states) appears attractive, all the more since 
for the most part it is Djindjic's and Kostunica's democrats, 
Serbian populists, and even Seselj's Radicals who are standing 
behind Karadzic. Besides, Milosevic's currently strongest rival 
is more popular among the church representatives and other 
national institutions as well. 
  This trench warfare, garnished with exchanges of smiles and 
also with the obvious lack of emotions despite benevolent, "too 
strong words" on the part of Karadzic, will probably last until 
a political settlement for Bosnia is signed. No doubt that as 
soon as that happens Milosevic will be offered by many sides 
what for the time being is openly proposed only by Djindjic, but 
it is also certain that some charismatic prime minister of a 
unified Serbian state (the first candidate would precisely be 
Karadzic) would be constantly undermining the position of the 
president of such a state. 
  Now it is Milosevic's turn to act, and he will probably 
weigh 
up until the last moment whether it is better for him to make a 
start in the possible all-Serbian state from the position of the 
indisputable president of Serbia, or from a less secure position 
of the head of the FRY. Therefore, the changes in Serbia 
mentioned by Clinton may refer in the first place to a possible 
revision of competences of the federation and those of the 
republics. According to the criteria of the majority of Serbs, 
Milosevic has done his job. Now it is executive bodies, 
cartographers, and even less soldiers who are on the move, and 
when speaking of giving up certain territories in Bosnia, for 
instance, Milosevic cannot exert any decisive influence on the 
matter any more, even if he would genuinely want to. And such a 
half-ceremonial position in the current situation perfectly 
suits Milosevic the politician, just as a break.

  [Text] [Announcer] Albanian political parties and other 
institutions in the republic of Kosova continue to react against 
fabrications regarding Albanian-Serb secret talks in Belgrade 
and against the individuals who are promoting such fabrications. 
Here is a report by Ramadan Mucolli from Prishtina: 
  [Mucolli] All the reactions of political parties and other 
Albanian bodies in Kosova against the Serb fabrications on the 
alleged secret talks between the Albanian and Serbian sides 
stress that only the legitimate Kosova representatives, freely 
elected by the people, have the mandate to hold such talks on 
the question of Kosova. 
  It is reported that a meeting of the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance [LDK] Branch Presidency in Gjakove stressed that the 
membership of this party in this commune is aware of the fact 
that only those who have the mandate of the people can talk 
about Kosova's political status. 
  On this occasion, they stressed that the position of the LDK 
and other Albanian political subjects on the solution of the 
Kosova question rely on the political will of the people 
expressed through a referendum and that the dialogue with 
Belgrade can be developed only on this basis and with the 
participation of international organizations. 
  The Kosova Liberal Party has also turned down offers by 
several Serb politicians for some individuals to participate in 
talks between Kosova and Serbia. 
  A public statement issued by this party states that Serbia 
is 
attempting to concoct a Serb-Albanian dialogue characteristic of 
the communist regime and of a modified and perfidious 
methodology. This party stresses that, by attempting to profess 
to the world that it allegedly supports dialogue with the 
Albanians, Serbia wants to select only the Albanians with whom 
it can find a common language to continue the slavery of the 
Albanian people in Kosova, but also to disqualify the legitimate 
representatives of the Kosova people elected in the free 
elections of 24 May 1992. 
  Regarding a solution on the question of Kosova, the Union of 
the Independent Trade Unions of Kosova has stated that it 
recognizes and supports only the legitimate representatives of 
the Kosovar people, who have the mandate to fulfill the 
determination of the people for Kosova as an independent and 
sovereign state. 
  In a conversation with a Dutch delegation, Dr. Hajrullah 
Gorani, chairman of these trade unions, stressed that the talks 
of individuals who represent no one are not serious and cannot 
solve any problem and, as such, they do not have the support of 
the people or the trade unions. 
  Branches and sub-branches of political parties and other 
Albanian associations in Kosova have also reacted to the Serb 
fabrications on these so-called secret talks.

<F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepi on news conference held by Rexhep </F>
Gjergji and Fatmir Sejdiu, members of the presidium of the 
Kosova Democratic Alliance, in Pristina on 27 May: "Encouraging 
Signs for the Albanian Political Movement in Kosova"] 
  [Text] President Rugova is successfully continuing his 
visit to several West European countries. After his visit to 
Denmark, he is now in Norway. His high-level reception and the 
understanding shown for the Albanians' demands are encouraging 
signs for the Albanian political movement in Kosova. On the 
first day of his visits president Rugova met the speaker of the 
Norwegian parliament, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, the parliamentary groups, and representatives of 
charities, who gave their full support to the peaceful policies 
of the Albanians and promised Norway's full commitment to 
helping to settle the question of Kosova in accordance with the 
Albanians' demands. With these comments, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, 
member of the presidium of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK], 
opened yesterday's news conference in Prishtina. 
<H5>  Voices That Initially Discounted the Elections </H5>
  Rexhep Gjergji went on to stress that the recent meeting of 
President Berisha and Gligorov in Poeradec was conducted as part 
of a commuted Albanian policy to settle through democratic means 
all the outstanding problems of the region, especially those of 
the Albanians in Macedonia. Gjergji then hailed the start of 
the daily publication of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT and 
the initiative to increase the amount of Albanian-language 
broadcasting on Macedonia Radio-Television, to expand the 
secondary school system, and to open a teacher-training college. 
Achieving state-forming status for the Albanians in Maoedonia 
means full equality with other citizens of this republic. Only 
in this way will Macedonia be stable and a factor of peace in 
the region. 
  Talking about the elections of 24 May 1992, Rexhep Gjergji 
said that in these first multiparty elections the electorate 
gave their votes for their own deputies and president. These 
elections were and will remain historic for the nation, for 
democracy, and for the Republic of Kosova. Serbian military and 
police forces have impeded the Constitution and operation of the 
parliament. Nevertheless, the elections have lost nothing of 
their importance. They gave legitimacy to the representatives 
of Kosova and of the Albanians and showed who has the right to 
decide and to speak on behalf of the people of Kosova. We 
consider the demands for the parliament to be constituted for 
the most part reasonable, as demands to further the formation of 
our institutions. However, there are also occasional voices 
that discount the elections. The parliament of the Republic of 
Kosova will be constituted at the most favorable opportunity and 
will operate freely, and nobody can decide anything about Kosova 
before this is done. 
<H5>  Weapons Campaign </H5>
  During last week too, the weapons campaign was widespread in 
the communes of Prishtina, Podujeve, Vushtrri [Vucitrn], 
Skendera, [Srbica], Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic], Gllogovo, 
Malisheve, Suhareke [Suva Reka], Ferizaj [Urosevac], Lipjan, 
Viti, Kline, etc. There were acts of barbarism on the part of 
the Serbian police, citizens were brutally beaten, and there 
were acts of destruction and vandalism. The Serbian police also 
entered the Kosova Chamber of Commerce and arrested everyone who 
was present, including its chairman Ismail Kastrati and 
secretary Sulejman Ahmeta. The chairman and secretory are still 
being held under arrest. There were also police interventions 
in schools, while the most provocative incident was the blockade 
of Prishtina market on the eve of Kurban sajram [Muslim 
festival, on whose eve believers buy sacrificial lambs]. Thus 
the Serbian regime demonstrated its vicious restrictions on 
religious freedoms. The weapons collection campaign and the 
forced recruitments of young Albanian men in the Serbian Army 
have been accompanied by the plunder of large sums of money from 
Albanians. There is plenty of evidence that can be published 
about these incidents. 
  Rexhep Gjergji and Fatmir Sejdiu, members of the LDK 
Presidium, went on to reply to journalists' questions. Asked 
what would be the keynote of Dr. Rugova's speech to the UN 
General Assembly, Fatmir Sejdiu said that Rugova's positions are 
familiar, and they will be placed before this important 
assembly. He will set forth his own standpoints, which are at 
the same time those of the people. 
<H5>  Vacillations of the International Community </H5>
  In reply to a question, Rexhep Gjergji said that FLAKA E 
VELLAZERIMIT had made an important contribution toward affirming 
the demands of the Albanians, especially in raising their status 
to a constituent element in the state. Meanwhile, commenting on 
President Clinton's statement about "tightening the measures 
against Serbia and Montenegro," he said that this was in 
accordance with our stand that the easing or removal of the 
sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro must be conditional on 
quenching the hotbeds of crisis in the former Yugoslavia, of 
course including the problem of Kosova. The demands of the 
congressmen too, Rexhep Gjergji went on, approximate to our 
stands, and it is probable that an ever-increasing number of 
congressmen will support our cause. 
  Rexhep Gjergji added that the main factor causing these 
crises and horrors in Europe is Milosevic and his gunmen. 
However, the international community has vacillated in its 
attitude toward him, and some of its measures have even 
emboldened him.

  [Text] The trumped-up trial of the 13 Albanians who were 
charged with impersonating leaders of the Defense Ministry 
[words indistinct] of Kosova will resume on 20 June. The trial 
began on 18 April but was postponed because of complaints by the 
attorneys, who are demanding that the prosecutor and deputy 
prosecutor of the Serb Prosecution Office for the Prishtina 
region be removed from the trial. 
  The attorneys have confirmed that the trial will continue, 
even though a request for defense has not been approved. The 
attorneys of the accused have denied the charges and consider 
the trial to be a politically trumped-up one against the 
Albanians in Kosova.

  [Excerpt] Pristina, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- The District Public 
Prosecutor's Office in Pristina today charged seven Kosovo 
Albanians with the criminal act of threatening the territorial 
integrity of Serbia and Yugoslavia. 
  Charges were filed against Fehmija Ljestrani, Skeljzen 
Bajrami, Ljuan Heta, Nedzmedin Sadriju, Becir Muljeci, Isni 
Franc, and Bajram Galapani. According to the indictment, during 
the second half of 1992 and last year, while in the Republic of 
Albania, the group "in cooperation with other persons, plotted 
and carried out actions aimed at helping the secession of Kosovo 
and Metohija, and other parts of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia populated with members of the Albanian minority with 
the ultimate aim of setting up a separate state, and its 
integration with neighboring Albania." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by C. Ibishi: "A Nightmare Life From Tortures"] </F>
  [Text] Anybody who sets off on the road to a village in 
Shala wonders in terror how he will pass the police checkpoints 
at Tunel i Pare and Stanterg. That is where the maltreatment 
begins, concluding with savage tortures in the Serbian police 
stations. Many buses are stopped at these sensitive points, and 
their passengers checked. Cars are also inspected, and the most 
eagerly expected are those with license plates from other towns. 
  All this is done on the pretext of searching for weapons and 
to create tension. During these checks, according to the mood 
of the police, travelers are beaten and then sent to the police 
station, where the police continue their "urgent" mission with 
beatings and manhandling of the harshest and most inhuman kind. 
Teachers also pass these checkpoints, and are taken in for 
questioning and asked where they are going and why. 
<H5>  Houses Raided, Men Tortured in Police Stations </H5>
  Raids on houses in the Shala region have recently 
intensified. Not a day has passed since the new year without a 
house being searched, supposedly for weapons or young people who 
have not been sent on military service. Heads of families are 
beaten in front of members of their family, and grown-up sons 
are tortured. The police go wild if they do not find weapons. 
They are not content with rubber truncheons, fists, kicks, and 
punches; there have been cases of men tied behind tractors and 
beaten on the back with spades. In some cases, teeth and ribs 
have been broken, and some people are still bedridden as a 
result of injuries caused by the police. Such beatings have 
occurred in Stanterg, Bare, Bajgore, Vidishiq, Rashan, Zabergje, 
Magjere, and recently in Vllahi and other villages. 
  Many men have been issued with summons to appear at the 
police station. Stanterg has for many months been a scene of 
torture, where the inhabitants of Shala wait in line to be taken 
in for questioning. If they do not hand in weapons, they are 
beaten and tortured by policemen now notorious for their 
barbaric lack of restraint. If the police wear themselves out 
beating Albanians, those waiting outside have to come back the 
next day to be subjected to police tortures. It has been common 
for dozens of village houses to be raided on the same day, with 
dozens of men and boys being taken to police stations to be 
beaten and tortured without scruple. The Serbian regime wants to 
sow fear in this region so that the population will move, with 
the younger generation setting off for the big wide world. 
<H5>  Heads of Households Beaten and Manhandled </H5>
  Police violence and torture take place not only in the 
villages of Mitrovice, but in those of Leposaviq and Vushtrri 
[Vucitrn]. The Albanians are mainly beaten over weapons. Old 
men say that these tortures are worse than those of 1956, 
because then only the heads of households were beaten, whereas 
now any male the police come across may be beaten at home in the 
presence of the rest of the family. Even women can be beaten, 
as in cases in Bistrice, Stanterg, Sllatine near Vushtrri, etc. 
This filthy campaign is being led by a certain Velovic, Kandic, 
and one Vucina from Vushtrri, who at one time pretended to be 
the Albanians' friends. Velovic has forgotten how he used to 
talk 10 years ago in front of delegations that came to Trepca, 
saying, "It is a pleasure to see Serbs, Albanians, Dalmatian 
Croats, Montenegrins, Romany Gypsies, and Latins living together 
at Tunel and Stanterg, helping each other....

  [Text] Tirana, June 5 (ATA) -- Some 13 witnesses testified 
yesterday in the trial against the ten former high communist 
functionaries. Witness Qazim Zelko, former secret police 
employee in the Sarande Secret Police sentenced in 1994 for 
abuse of office, testified on the kinds of operation ways by the 
secret police, especially in controlling the correspondence. 
Asked by prosecutor Fana if they used to control only the 
correspondence of the persons against whom had already 
investigations, witness Qazim Zelko said the former secret 
police controlled even before the penal case had started. 
Witness Sirjan Caci, former Army officer in the border, former 
instructor in the Spaci camp, and former commissar in the 
educating camp in Sarande, testified also on the control of the 
correspondence. 
  Witness Mihallaq Ziqishti testified on the initiators of the 
anti-religion campaign. Zeqishti, former functionary of the 
Ministry of Interior Affairs and first secretary of the former 
Communist Party in Korce and Durres, has been condemned by death 
sentence during the Second World War and charged with anti- 
revolutionary activity and sentenced with 25 years imprisonment 
together with the group of Mehmet Shehu, former communist prime 
minister accused of espionage activity. Witness Ziqishti said 
that "Rita Marko could take this initiative (anti-religion one) 
even without approval of the `most important.'" The witness 
also said that Enver Hoxha had ordered to open a museum in which 
they would keep all the icons and religious relics. The 
initiative was of the party, Ziqishti said, and the party was a 
state one. 
  Agron Tafa, former interior minister during the 1975-1984 
period, testified on the revolt of the Qafa e Barit camp. Asked 
by prosecutor Fana if there were special police forces for 
pressing the revolts, Tafa said "yes," but he added that those 
forces were in the competence of Deputy Interior Minister 
Zylyftar Ramizi. 
  Ded Miri, former political prisoner in the Qafa e Barit 
camp, 
testified on the incident in this camp, the circumstances and 
the conditions which brought about the revolt, and the 
consequences of the intervention of the special police forces. 
On behalf of those who suffered in the prisons, he said, the 
persons who committed the crime should be punished. "We do not 
seek to take revenge but we ask for justice," witness Miri said. 
  Witness Ismail Skeja, former director for the borders in the 
Interior Ministry, said the most difficult period for the 
borders have been the first seven months of the 1990. 
  For health reasons, defendants Manush Myftiu and Adil 
Carcani 
were not present at yesterday's seance. Their defence was made 
by their attorneys. The next seance resumes today at 1200.

  [Text] Tirana, June 6 (ATA) -- In yesterday's sitting of 
the trial of 10 former senior officials of the Albanian 
communist system, five witnesses, former employees of the 
Interior Branch of Sarande, gave testimony on the practices used 
in guarding the sea border, the way of realising the imitation 
and procedures carried out to transport drowned corpses who had 
attempted to cross the border. 
  Mithat Bala, Luan Zani, Reiz Maksuti, (non-commissioned 
officers), confessed before the jury that the order for the 
transportation of corpses on board of the motorboat and their 
demonstration was given by the former chairman of the district's 
interior branch, Defendant Veiz Haderi, to show in this way "the 
vigilant guarding of the border." 
  Witness Maqo Como, political prisoner, and former deputy and 
minister, bore testimony of the history of his family in prisons 
and internment, a history which bears the seal of the 
Expulsion-Internment Commission. 
  Zvetllana Marku, the daughter of General Gjin Marku executed 
by the regime of dictator Hoxha, testified to the injustices and 
intolerance of this commission.

  [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- "The border point of Hani i 
Hotit has not been closed," confirmed the spokesman of the 
Albanian Ministry of Public Order, refuting a report from the 
Automoto League of Former Yugoslavia according to which 
"Albanian bodies do not allow the entry of cars with Yugoslav 
number plates to Albania." The spokesman said that there is a 
strict border control in Hani i Hotit due to the fuel 
trafficking. Several Albanian and Montenegrin citizens involved 
in the traffic have been detained. Control is being made mainly 
for vehicles but this does not hinder the movement of citizens 
from both sides of the border.

  [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- Peter Boross, prime 
minister of the outgoing government, held talks with Alliance of 
Free Democrats (SZDSZ) Chairman Ivan Peto and acting SZDSZ 
parliamentary faction leader Gabor Kuncze. In the May general 
elections, the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum garnered 9.59 
percent of the vote and the opposition SZDSZ, 18.14 percent. 
The SZDSZ is expected to enter into a coalition with the 
victorious Socialist Party, who received 54.15 percent. 
  Boross briefed Peto and Kuncze on what kind of information 
he 
is to provide the next cabinet when handing over governmental 
affairs, and what measures he deems necessary for a smooth 
change in government during the remainder of the year. 
  Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Kuncze said that 
Boross had listed tasks arising from the transfer of government, 
outlined affairs involving state guarantees, and discussed 
privatization. Both sides agreed on a need for changing the 
previous relationship between ruling parties and the opposition, 
Kuncze said. 
  Boross asked for the SZDSZ's opinion on the possibility of 
Gyorgy Szabad staying on as speaker of parliament. Peto told 
the press that his party holds the idea to be improper, because 
in their view the agreement reached after the 1990 elections, 
that the strongest ruling party is to name a speaker of 
parliament, should be applied again this time. 
  Regarding the coalition talks beginning on Tuesday [7 June] 
between the the Socialists and the Free Democrats, Peto said 
they would probably discuss technical matters and select topics 
for future negotiations. The SZDSZ chairman presumed that it 
would take at least three years [as received] to formulate a 
joint position on the most important questions.

  [Text] Budapest, June 4 (MTI) -- At its one-day closed-door 
session on Saturday [4 June], the National Board of the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] discussed parliamentary 
election experiences and the party's internal situation. A 
statement issued to the press after the conference, party 
chairman Lajos Fur announced the resignation of the MDF 
Presidium at the party's next special national convention, the 
date for which will be set later on. The statement says, "The 
board considers it necessary to thoroughly examine both the 
party's unsatisfactory election result and its future policy." 
  Spokesman Karoly Herenyi told journalists that the board 
meeting heard over 30 contributions on reasons behind the 
election failure and ways of proceeding ahead. The MDF, 
adapting to current conditions, should shape its policy in a 
different style as an opposition force, it was stated at the 
session.

  [Text] Budapest, June 5 (MTI) -- The 26-strong 
parliamentary group of the Independent Smallholders Party [FKgP] 
has elected party chairman Jozsef Torgyan faction leader on 
Sunday [5 June], the first day of their Budapest statutory 
meeting. The FKgP took fourth place -- 6.74 per cent -- among 
the six parties that got into Hungary's National Assembly in the 
May general elections. 
  Asked by MTI, Torgyan said he was elected parliamentary 
faction leader unanimously. The rules of operation will also 
have to be discussed and approved at the meeting, he added. 
  Commenting on the Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] special 
Saturday [4 June] congress nominating party chairman Gyula Horn 
for premiership, Torgyan said he was not surprised at the 
decision as he had always considered Horn the most likely 
candidate for the post. Horn's personal contribution to the 
MSZP's overwhelming election victory is indisputable, he said. 
It would have been total negligence of the voters' will if 
somebody else had been nominated for the prime ministerial post, 
Torgyan said. For the same reason, the Alliance of Free 
Democrats is almost certain to say yes to a coalition, he added. 
  The FKgP is preparing to provide a forthright opposition to 
the next government. "This is the only party that has repeatedly 
made it clear-cut from the very beginning: It will not 
cooperate with the Socialists in any way," Torgyan said.

  [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- At the request of Gyorgy 
Rasko, who ran for parliamentary deputy on the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) ticket in the 6th constituency -- 
Gyor-Sopron County -- and received 10 fewer votes than Gyula 
Varga of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in the run-off 
elections on May 29, the National Election Committee checked the 
342 invalid votes cast in the constituency and found 68 to be 
valid. 
  Of these, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor Simon of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), and 16 to Varga. In this way, 
Rasko moved to first place with 9,417 votes, ahead of Varga, who 
thus had 9,412 votes. Simon received 21 additional votes, but 
even so he remained third, with 8,200 votes. 
  At Rasko's request, on Thursday [9 June] afternoon the 
committee will re-examine all 26,000 votes cast in the 
constituency. The MDF would thus send 38 and the SZDSZ 69 
parliamentary deputies to the 386-seat parliament.

  [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- "I sincerely hope that 
Hungary's new government will not forget its obligations towards 
ethnic Hungarians beyond the border, that it will use all 
possible means -- including international forums -- to further 
their interests, and that it will hold preliminary discussions 
on all related political moves with legitimate leaders of 
cross-border Hungarian organizations beforehand." 
  ``I also hope that the new government will require that 
policy on ethnic Hungarians abroad be invariably based on a 
consensus between parliamentary parties. 
  "I shall be in a position to warn my successor in the post 
of 
prime minister of this obligation," says a letter from Peter 
Boross to Oradea Bishop Laszlo Tokes, which was released by the 
Government Spokesperson's Office to MTI on Monday [6 June]. 
  Boross was replying to Tokes's open letter, published in the 
Budapest daily MAGYAR NEMZET on April 11, asking for Hungary's 
political support for Transylvanian Hungarians, urging the 
conclusion of a bilateral cooperation accord between the 
Hungarian Government and the Hungarian Democratic Federation of 
Romania, and calling for political and economic assistance to 
curb the emigration of Hungarians from Transylvania.

  [Text] Budapest, June 6 (MTI) -- Concerning the 
correspondence between Peter Boross and Laszlo Tokes, the 
Government Spokesperson's Office sent the following position to 
MTI: 
  ``The government of the Republic of Hungary believes that 
one 
of the most important aims of the recently-launched process is 
the adoption of practical measures in East-Central Europe that 
will bring genuine improvement in the position of national 
minorities living here. 
  ``The purpose of the series of negotiations is to help 
strengthen political and legal commitments, which -- when met -- 
will increase the region's stability and improve cooperation 
between states. 
  ``This would benefit both the concerned minorities and the 
broader community. 
  ``The initiative of the European Union is intended to set 
off 
a process, in which two neighbouring countries will hold 
bilateral talks with EU presence and mediation, and subsequently 
conclude good-neighbourly agreements with knowledge and in 
consideration of minority interests and opinions. 
  ``Start of a continuous dialogue between the concerned 
minority and the government with EU mediation towards settling 
questions of dispute by mutually satisfactory agreements is a 
key factor of these talks. 
  ``Although the Hungarian Government cannot formally 
represent 
ethnic Hungarian citizens of other countries, it considers it 
indispensable for representatives of the concerned minorities to 
be able to express their views and comment on the agreements 
reached during the process. 
  ``This is equally in the interests of minorities, 
governments 
and all conference participants, since lasting stability can 
only be ensured by accords accepted by the minorities as well. 
  "Hungary is ready to discuss the above issues on a bilateral 
basis within the framework of the process, and welcomes EU's 
active participation and its willingness to provide moderator's 
assistance to the concerned parties in every phase of the 
negotiations."

  [Text] Budapest, June 3 (MTI) -- The chairman of the 
Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians (VMDK) in Serbia, 
Andras Agoston, recently accused the Hungarian Government -- in 
press statements carried in Hungary -- of having tried to split 
the VMDK. 
  Ministry officials said the Foreign Ministry has always 
accepted the VMDK as the legitimate representative of Hungarians 
in Vojvodina. In this spirit leaders of the Foreign Ministry 
held talks with the VMDK delegations in Hungary, and in the 
course of official and unofficial visits to Yugoslavia. The 
Foreign Ministry and the Hungarian diplomatic corps has done 
much to make the problems of Vojvodina Hungarians known in the 
world, mainly in the international organisations trying to 
settle the South Slav crisis. 
  Hungarian foreign affairs leaders, including Foreign 
Minister 
Geza Jeszenszky, State Secretaries Andras Kelemen and Janos 
Martonyi, firmly supported the VMDK during their visits to 
Yugoslavia in the past years, agreeing to appear at events 
organised by the VMDK, and backing the VMDK publicly. 
  Hungarian foreign affairs leaders continually pressed for 
the 
VMDK to be accepted as a political negotiating side by Yugoslav 
partners, and for negotiating the issues they raised. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry has also provided concrete 
financial support to the activity of the Vox Humana Humanitarian 
Service, set up with encouragement from the VMDK. Alongside the 
VMDK, Hungary helped ease the winter hardship for Vojvodina 
Hungarians, Foreign Ministry officials told MTI.

  [Text] Budapest, 7 June (MTI) -- The Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry follows with sympathy the efforts of the Slovak 
politicians who take a genuine stand for fulfilling the norms 
accepted at the time of their country's membership in the 
Council of Europe, spokesman for the Hungarian Foreign Ministry 
Janos Herman said today. Herman made the comment at his usual 
Tuesday [7 June] press briefing in answer to a question on how 
Hungary received the fiasco of the so-called "sign bill" in 
Bratislava's parliament. The bill would have made it possible 
to use road and village signs in the Hungarian language. 
  Herman stressed that Budapest is highly appreciative of the 
fact that Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik indicated his 
government's intention to re-submit the bill on the use of 
Hungarian signs to Parliament as soon as this becomes possible 
under the Slovak constitutional framework. 
  Herman also said the text of the Hungarian-Slovak 
deportation 
agreement has, in effect, been completed, and now only requires 
an agreement on the date for signing it.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 2/6/1994 -- Appreciative 
statements about Romania's position to the crisis in the 
Yugoslav space made by several high-ranking officials of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have been clustered by the daily 
newspaper DIMINEATA in its today's issue. 
  Radoje Kontic, prime minister of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, said that Romania's position relative to the complex 
situation in the area of former Yugoslavia, including its stance 
in the question of the economic sanctions instated against 
Serbia and Montenegro are remarkable by their being "poised, 
objective, and principled." Romania, he said, "has and is 
playing a realistic and constructive role in the crisis 
affecting former Yugoslavia," by making itself available any 
time to be one of the initiators of negotiated settlements 
pursuing the suspension of the economic sanctions and as a 
country which, after Yugoslavia, has been most affected by these. 
  Momir Bulatovic, president of the Republic of Montenegro, 
showed that between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, of which 
Montenegro is a constituent part, and Romania the relations have 
always been friendly and cooperative in various fields. "We are 
happy that now, in the difficult situation we are confronted 
with, we have found in Romania and its people feelings of true 
friendship and full understanding. We hope for an as fast as 
possible settlement of the crisis in our zone, so that we can 
resume these relations," Bulatovic said. 
  The prime minister of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, assessed 
that once the sanctions suspended, the conditions would be put 
in place for a direct Romanian-Montenegro cooperation, for the 
mutual benefit of the sides, in sectors like tourism, 
machine-building, ecology, and agriculture. 
  Under the current circumstances, as Milan Grubic, director 
of 
the press department of the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry remarked, 
in its relationships with all states, Romania included, 
Yugoslavia makes efforts to reach a balance between each 
country's role and interest in the zone of former Yugoslavia. 
The best experience gained to this effect was in relationship 
with Romania, Grubic said, the ties with this country being "an 
example of communication between two good neighbors. We have 
never been in conflict, we have been bonded by true friendship. 
In our relations with Romania, we started from the principle 
that `ideologies are transient, peoples permanent.'"

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 4/6/1994 -- Romania's Foreign 
Affairs Ministry issued a memorandum providing its viewpoint 
with regard to the memorandum submitted to the Council of Europe 
[CE] by rapporteurs Gunnar Jansson and Friedrich Koenig on the 
honoring of the commitments entered into by Romania on its 
accession to the Council of Europe. 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it had taken notice of 
the 
conclusion in Paragraph 35 of the rapporteurs' memorandum 
reading as follows: "The discussions with the representatives 
of the political parties and of the press showed us that Romania 
is a pluralistic democracy and that the basis for development in 
many respects is present." 
  According to the Romanian Foreign Ministry, the 
Jansson-Koenig memorandum "contains a number of information 
already obsolete due to the recent developments in the Romanian 
society, as well as some other inaccurate or biased ones, the 
latter due at times to the unilateral sources of information on 
which the conclusions of the memorandum were based." 
  The Romanian Foreign Ministry sought to bring some 
additional 
clarification through its memorandum. Following are excerpts of 
this memorandum: 
  "On 17 May 1994, the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu, 
promulgated the Law on the Ratification of the European 
Convention on Human Rights and the additional protocols thereto" 
which "fully accounts for Romania's determination and readiness 
to honor the obligations deriving from the most relevant 
instrument of the Council of Europe." 
  "The ratification procedures of the General Agreement on 
Privileges and Immunities of the Council of Europe and the 
protocol thereto are high on the Parliament's agenda. 
Preliminaries for the signing of the European Charter on Local 
Self-Government and of the European Convention of Trans-Frontier 
Cooperation are well under way." 
  "On 4 November 1993 Romania signed the Convention and the 
two 
protocols which are now at the parliament pending ratification." 
  "The reference made to the prefect of Cluj, Mr. Grigore 
Zanc, 
is not sustained by facts. The prefect has taken no measure at 
all that may be considered as discriminatory towards Romanian 
citizens of Hungarian origin." 
  "The specialized commissions of the parliament are examining 
two draft laws on minorities, one submitted by the UDMR 
(Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) and the other by the 
parliamentary group of the national minorities in the Chamber of 
Deputies." 
  "The draft law on education is also included on the 
parliament's agenda for examination. This draft law was drawn 
up in keeping with the provisions in the Constitution 
guaranteeing the right of the persons belonging to national 
minorities to be taught in their mother tongue and the right to 
education in their maternal language." 
  "This draft law goes well beyond the current standards of 
the 
Council of Europe in what regards education and training in the 
languages of national minorities." 
  "The setting up and preserving of bilingual signs pertains 
solely to the competence of the local authorities." 
  "The Government of Romania undertook no action whatsoever to 
remove bilingual signs across the country." 
  "Medical and vocational training, as well as the teaching of 
history and geography have always been held in Romanian, the 
national language of the country. Therefore it is not a matter 
of imposing restrictions on the education for the minorities." 
  ``Issues, such as the opening of new border crossings 
between 
Romania and Hungary, the potential inauguration of a Hungarian 
consulate in Cluj, or the elimination of taxes for border area 
inhabitants are considered within the normal context of 
bilateral Romanian-Hungarian relations. Such issues are in no 
way related to the commitments entered into by Romania on its 
accession to the Council of Europe. 
  "All persons of Hungarian origin granted pardon by the 
president were released." 
  "As concerns Mr. Pal Cseresnyes, he does not belong to the 
group of eight ethnic Hungarians pardoned by the president." 
  "At the time the pardon decree was issued, none of the 
members of the former [Romanian Communist Party] Central 
Committee were imprisoned, all of them being released on medical 
grounds and the carrying out of their sentences temporarily 
halted." 
  "The former president of the Bucharest Court of Justice 
[Cornel Turianu] was dismissed by the minister of justice from 
his administrative office as court president and not from his 
position as magistrate." 
  "The minister of justice, in a letter addressed to the head 
of the Legal Affairs Division, has requested the expertise of 
the Council of Europe with reference to Article 19 of the law on 
the organization of the judiciary in Romania." 
  "The draft law on the ombudsman was forwarded to the 
parliament, where it will be discussed soon." 
  "The statement that, with the exception of the prosecutor 
general and his deputy, `all other prosecutors are army men,' is 
not based on truth. Actually, the overwhelming majority of 
prosecutors are civilians." 
  "The Law on the Organization and Functioning of the Romanian 
Police adopted by the parliament during the month of April, the 
current year, comprises entirely new juridical standards as 
compared to the previous regulations, rules allowing for the 
transformation of this body into one of the basic institutions 
of the state of law." 
  ``As to the previous law stipulating that the police 
personnel consists of military staff and civilian personnel, the 
recent law of the Romanian Police stipulates that 'the personnel 
of the police consists of policemen and civilian personnel.' 
Actually, the institutional-organizational structures of the 
police are entirely distinct from the typically military ones. 
  "Concerning the allegations on 'telephone tapping,' the 
situations involving interception of communications concern 
strictly such actions infringing upon the national security of 
Romania. According to the law, it is the specially appointed 
prosecutor who is sole and only authority entitled to allow the 
interception of communications." 
  "The activities of control of the Romanian Information 
[Intelligence] Service (SRI) exerted by the Romanian Parliament 
are ruled by a clearly specified and efficient frame aiming to 
protect the service against any political interference and to 
prevent any trespassing as to the prerogatives it was granted by 
law." 
  "With reference to the subject of nationalized property 
(buildings,) a juridical solution is under study, by means of 
which, while postulating the rights of the former house owners 
and of their heirs, the effects of such a solution on the 
hundreds of thousands of persons affected by the restitution, 
should be taken care of." 
  "As to land property, the matter is solved according to the 
Law on Land Property, which was passed by the parliament in 
1991." 
  "The draft law related to the profession of lawyer, passed 
by 
the Senate in 1993, is on the agenda of the Chamber of Deputies 
and will be discussed depending on the break-down of priorities 
faced by the chamber." 
  "The process of revision of Article 200 in the Romanian 
Criminal Code related to homosexuality is practically completed, 
the Romanian legislation allowing thus the jurisprudence of the 
European Court of Human Rights in the matter." 
  "The reason of the temporary suspension of the accreditation 
[to the presidential headquarters] of the journalists of the 
daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI is determined by the fact that they have 
repeatedly and blatantly spread misleading news concerning the 
activity of the presidential institution and have systematically 
avoided to publish the due denials when confronted with the 
proof of their bad faith." 
  "Immediately after the conclusion of each press conference 
of 
the president or of his spokesman, all media have unrestricted 
access to the full transcription of the recording of the 
respective conference." 
  "The decision according to which printed matter can be 
mailed 
abroad only from one post office has been revoked." 
  "The rapporteurs of the [Council of Europe] Parliamentary 
Assembly were erroneously informed as to the so-called 
nationalization of the SOTI television channel. In order to be 
nationalized, the second channel of the Romanian television (on 
which SOTI is currently broadcasting) should have previously 
been a privately-owned channel. Channel 2 has never been 
private, it has always been a public service channel. SOTI 
station has obtained the frequency channel 57 by public bidding." 
  ``Freedom of faith is fully granted in Romania. The issue of 
the restitution of the ecclesiastical property was constantly 
approached during talks between the different established 
religions in the country and also during talks with the 
government authorities. The scarcity of financial means with 
which the confessional education is confronted does not spare 
the education system in general during this difficult period of 
transition and economic restructuring. 
  ``The memorandum includes the summary of a document directly 
handed over to the rapporteurs by the trade unions. The 
statements, which were not previously checked, such as the one 
according to which trade union members risk losing their jobs if 
there is evidence that they act as leaders in their trade union. 
[sentence as received] 
  ``The statement that 'the parliamentary majority hinders the 
implementation of the reforms' should be reconsidered taking 
into account the fact that in a state based on the rule of law, 
such as Romania, the parliament itself is an essential source of 
the legitimacy of the reform, and it is precisely this majority

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 2/6/1994 -- Deputies endorsed by 
vote on June 2 Article 8 of the Education Bill, which stipulates 
that education of all grades shall proceed in Romanian. It was 
also established that the study and learning of the Romanian 
language as the official language in the state shall be 
compulsory for all Romanian citizens, irrespective of 
nationality. 
  After contradictory discussions, the deputies rejected the 
amendments promoted by Varujan Vosganian (Armenians' Union of 
Romania) and Benedek Nagy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania) protesting the introduction of this article, which 
belongs to the general principles of expressing provisions on 
the education in the mother tongues of the nationalities and in 
the languages of international circulation [sentence as 
received]. The amendments were assessed as "overzealous," 
especially considering that by the same article the deputies 
voted in favor of guaranteeing the right of persons belonging to 
ethnic minorities to study and get instructed in their mother 
tongue, and the education bill gives special attention to this 
issue in other articles.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 3/6/1994 -- "Mass privatization 
will begin by 1 September 1994," said Mircea Cosea, head of the 
Governmental Council for Economic Coordination, Strategy, and 
Reform. 
  "We have reached a phase when some successes in the 
macro-economic stabilization have been obtained through monetary 
instruments," said Reform Minister Mircea Cosea, cited by the 
daily ADEVARUL. 
  The reform minister said that these "fragile" successes must 
be consolidated through "substantial measures in the real 
economy" with privatization as the most important one. 
  Privatization will lead "not only to the change of the 
ownership structure, but also of the economic structure, of the 
industrial structure in the first place," said Minister Cosea. 
  Beginning 1 September, the ownership certificates previously 
granted to the people may be exchanged for shares in commercial 
companies. 
  According to the privatization law, the aggregate value of 
the ownership certificates represent 30 percent of the aggregate 
nominal capital of all Romanian commercial companies, so far 
owned by the state. 
  The public will have the alternative of keeping these 
certificates with the Private Property Fund (FPP) that are going 
to act as fund manager, caring for dividend payments. 
  The public can also chose to sell these certificates on the 
market. 
  The mechanisms of this economic-financial process will be 
actuated as soon as the summer with an advertising campaign 
meant to introduce to the public the 3,000 companies whose 
shares will be offered to the public in exchange for ownership 
certificates. 
  "The most delicate problem is the setting of a value to 
these 
certificates," said Minister Cosea. At the time being, the 
"value" of the certificates is understated on the black market 
as well as by the Private Property Fund, opined the minister. A 
value closer to reality can be obtained through an accurate 
evaluation of the nominal capital of the companies as done by 
the end of 1993.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 3/6/1994 -- The average monthly 
inflation rate for the first four months of the current year was 
6.3 percent, that is a decrease from the 9.7 percent average 
monthly inflation rate recorded in the first four months of 
1993, said Romania's National Statistics Board. In April 1994, 
the non-edibles' prices rose by 6.3 percent, the highest rate in 
the economy while the economy's average inflation rate was 6.1 
percent. Conclusions from these figures are hard to draw. The 
population did not perceive any sensible improvement in its 
living standard. Salaries rose in April by 12.1 percent compared 
to March, but the increase is still below the 13 percent rate 
established by the government, which is a sign that many 
economic companies failed to comply with the indexation measures 
called for by the government. If the purchasing power of the 
population did not rise sensibly, it seems that the households 
have some chances to make savings. The 9.1 percent fall of the 
aggregate sales in April seems to point in the same direction, 
indicating that the population increased its savings. The 647.4 
billion lei worth of sales in April were by 27.5 percent less 
than the sales in April 1993. The aggregate sales for the first 
four months of the current year totalled 2,423.2 billion lei. 
While the aggregate indices do not tell very much of the 
inflation impact on the living standard of the individuals, the 
average salary with various sectors are more telling: 294,121 
lei in the financial and banking sector, 211,792 in the mining 
industry, 91,671 in the light industry and 98,895 lei in 
education.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 6/6/1994 -- "Despite the drought 
severely affecting a number of 13 counties in Eastern and 
South-Eastern Romania, we still believe in a normal farm year, 
real possibilities being in place to achieve good results at the 
main crops," Ioan Oancea, minister of food and agriculture told 
the government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  According to estimations, the wheat crop could be at least 
at 
the level of 1993, with chances to top some six million tonnes, 
"which exceeds the domestic consumption needs," the Romanian 
minister said, referring to the "extremely good crops in Western 
Romania". Mentioning that the spring sowing programme has been 
fully completed, Minister Oancea considers that Romania can 
count finally on a cereal production of about 18 million tonnes. 
  For the sugar beet crop, although sown on a smaller surface 
as initially foreseen, but however exceeding the past year's one 
by 50,000 hectares, during a normal agricultural year crops 
would actually cover the current domestic needs. As for the 
sunflower crop "it is looking very good, so we can count on a 
surplus of edible oil that could go on foreign markets," the 
minister said. 
  Referring to the harvest campaign, Ioan Oancea said that the 
situation is extremely difficult, for agriculture is not 
equipped with enough farm machinery, for the necessary credits 
failed to be ensured for purchase of spares due to which repair 
works were delayed. To cover this deficit "we have in view 
cooperation actions with units in neighboring countries such as 
Hungary, Moldova, Bulgaria, that would provide services on a 
contract basis". 
  According to Minister Oancea, priority in this period are 
the 
irrigation works. "At the beginning of this month, irrigation 
works were performed on less than 500,000 hectares," the 
minister said, as a result of indiscipline in administering farm 
equipment.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament 
today rejected the bill on place names which would enable the 
use of bilingual (Slovak-Hungarian) names for towns and villages 
in which the ethnic minority populations make up at least one 
fifth of the population. One of Slovakia's commitments towards 
the Council of Europe remains thus unfulfilled and the 
government coalition suffered a serious break. 
  Although the coalition supported by the Hungarian minority 
parties had a majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for 
the law, 61 deputy voted against it and 6 deputies abstained 
from voting. Only one vote more was required for the law to be 
passed. 
  Two of the 14 Hungarian deputies present abstained from the 
vote and one even voted against. These three deputies from the 
Egyutteles movement were dissatisfied by the change in the 
initial government bill banning the use of Hungarian names in 
the case of villages named after Slovak historical figures, such 
as for example Sladkovicovo and Hurbanovo. 
  The failure was also due to the absence of a part of 
coalition deputies and the negative stand by former supporters 
of the Slovak National Party (SNS) who have come over to the 
government camp. The SNS was a coalition partner of Vladimir 
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, until the 
government was dismissed in mid-March. 
  The parliament rejected proposals for changes in the bill, 
but approved a compromise proposal by Lubomir Forgas from the 
government Democratic Left Party (SDL) to ban names from the 
period of Magyarisation and Hortyite occupation of southern 
Slovakia in World War Two. The proposal would also make it 
possible to change the names stated in the minority's language 
on the basis of local referendum. 
  This was a second attempt to comply with Slovakia's promise 
to fulfill recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE) last 
June when Slovakia was admitted as a CE member. 
  In January this year the parliament rejected a bill 
submitted 
by Meciar's government, also due to negative votes by Hungarian 
deputies, because the bill would have allowed bilingual road 
sign posts only in communities in which the minority constitutes 
at least 30 per cent of the population. 
  The two-day heated debate has confirmed that the nationality 
question has been a topic of political struggle before autumn 
elections (September 30-October 1). The opposition did not 
hesitate to argue with fears of Magyrisation, irredentism and 
Hungarian territorial autonomy in the south inhabited by a 
Hungarian minority of more than half a million. 
  Hungarian deputies did not conceal their disappointment at 
the government's failure to fulfill its promise made to the 
Hungarian coalition (Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement, MKDH -- 14 out of a total of 150 
parliamentary seats). 
  MKDH group's chairman Pal Csaky told CTK that "it would be 
premature to speak about a coalition crisis, but it (the bill's 
rejection) will have serious consequences. We will not go over 
to the opposition in any case, this would be short-sighted." 
  Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles said that "the government 
coalition has failed to keep its word... The situation can 
assume the proportions of a crisis." But he added that "union 
with the opposition is ruled out." 
  He said that the Hungarian groups had supported the bill 
even 
in the changed form because it would have allowed 480 
communities to use Hungarian names. He added he did not think 
that the different stands by three Egyutteles deputies could 
affect the Hungarian coalition's unity. 
  Peter Weiss, chairman of the strongest coalition entity, 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), said "the (failed) vote on one bill 
cannot be considered an expression of difficulties in the 
government coalition. I do not see the ensuing situation as 
dramatic." 
  He said that HZDS and SNS deputies had not had the will to 
agree to an acceptable compromise, but added he was convinced 
that "any government will have to submit such a law sooner or 
later" because of the commitment made to the CE. 
  "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak 
National Party do not have any other but the nationality card 
for their voters and they want to base their campaign on 
provoking the feeling of danger," Weiss said. 
  Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS group, said: "We could not 
support the bill since our proposals improving it were not 
accepted. The project solved only the demands of the Hungarian 
minority and did not take into consideration the others. 
Moreover, it directly forced (on communities) bilingualism 
while our proposal left it up to the communities to decide." 
  "The law was not approved because of the absence of deputies 
from the government coalition," chairman of the Democratic Union 
(DEUS) group Vladimir Bajan admitted. 
  He added that the expected the negative stand by deputies 
from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) of 
Ludovit Cernak to have "repercussions" in the coalition. 
  "The compromise character of the law was so strong that it 
was impossible not to approve it. The revivalists (Slovak 
historical figures) have only caused problems. It will probably 
be necessary to call an extraordinary coalition meeting," Bajan 
said.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- Matica Slovenska 
[Heritage Foundation], the Slovak cultural organization which 
fosters national legacy, has welcomed that the law which was to 
allow the bilingual place names of the towns and villages 
inhabited by ethnic minorities had not been adopted today. 
  "The bill wanted to base the place names in the ethnically 
mixed Slovak territory on the old Hungarian and 
Horthyite-Hungarian names. In doing so, it would provide a basis 
for the official and territorial autonomy and further directive 
Magyarisation of the Slovak south, regardless of the views of 
the local people, including more than one million of Slovaks," 
Stanislav Bajanik, a Matica secretary, told radio today. South 
Slovakia was annexed by Hungary between 1938 and 1945 when 
Admiral Miklos Horthy ruled in Hungary. 
  Bajanik said it was a satisfaction to Matica's activities 
that the law had not been passed. He praised the deputies "who 
understood the causes and consequences of the 
Magyarisation-aimed steps." According to Bajanik, Matica is 
ready to help settle the language order in Slovakia as it has 
prepared a draft law on protecting the state language which 
would resolve the rights and duties of the Slovak and minority 
languages.

  [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament 
today passed an amendment to the Election Law with 69 deputies 
of those present voting for the law, 51 deputies against it and 
2 deputies abstaining from the vote. The amendment does not 
change the basic provisions of the federal Election Law which 
has thus far been valid in Slovakia. For example, it preserves 
the requirement of 5 percent public support for a party and 7 
percent for a coalition to enter parliament. 
  The government coalition prevented the inclusion of a 
provision into the amendment according to which parties' lists 
of candidates should be sent to voters three days before 
elections as this would create the danger of manipulation. 
Parties' slates will be available at election rooms and only 
information about candidates will be sent to voters. 
  The amended Election Law was passed in something of a hurry 
as can be seen from the fact that an hour's break was taken 
before the final vote during which the parliament leadership 
looked for ways to replace "Czechoslovak Republic" into "Slovak 
Republic" in the law. The amendment does not allow election 
campaigning on commercial radio stations. 
  Deputy Pavel Hrusovsky from the Christian Democratic 
Movement 
(KDH) said that the amended law did not give an unambiguous 
answer to whether a Slovak citizen living abroad can vote in 
Slovakia. The contradiction between the provision which allows 
voting only by citizens with permanent residence in the Slovak 
Republic and that which allows voting by citizens without 
permanent residence in Slovakia will apparently be solved only 
by the Interior Ministry or an election commission. 
  "Slovak citizens with permanent residence in the Czech 
Republic could be stripped of their active voting rights," 
Hrusovsky told CTK. However, other deputies believe that it 
will be enough for a Slovak citizen living in the Czech Republic 
just to come to Slovakia during the election to be able to vote. 
  The amendment sets down that parties that receive at least 3 
percent of voters support will get from the state 60 crowns for 
each voter instead of the initial 15 crowns.

  [Text] Komarno, west Slovakia, June 5 (CTK) -- "Those 
Slovaks who want to have a stake in the future have to prevent 
the sale of Slovak national interests carried out by Premier 
Jozef Moravcik's government, reads a Slovak National Party (SNS) 
statement given to CTK today [no closing quotation mark as 
received]. The SNS will run the autumn early election campaign 
in coalition with twelve small parties, according to a decision 
by delegates at the 6th SNS conference yesterday. 
  "In (ex-premier Vladimir) Meciar's opinion it will be better 
if the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will run on its 
own and other nationalist parties will form a coalition with the 
SNS," SNS Deputy Chairwoman Eva Slavkovska told CTK on Saturday 
[4 June]. Although HZDS popularity dropped five percent from 
April, a May opinion poll showed it to be the most popular party 
with support running at 21 percent. 
  The SNS is not afraid of competing for nationalist votes 
against the HZDS since the two parties had agreed on a correct 
line, something that would make post-election cooperation 
easier, Slavkovska said. 
  The coalition bloc, provisionally called the Slovak Popular 
Bloc (SLUB), is to include the Christian Social Union (KSU), the 
Slovak Soldiers' Association (ASV), the Confederation of 
Political Prisoners (KPV), the Slovak National Democratic 
Movement (SNDH), and other nationalist parties and movements. 
  Father Anton Hlinka, a former VOA and RFE employee who 
returned to Slovakia after the November 1989 revolution, and 
Julius Binder, who led the construction of the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric project, have lobbied for the 
bloc. 
  The conference decided to abolish honorary chairmanships of 
Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jozef Prokes, who, unlike 
the SNS Chairman Jan Slota, favor a coalition with the HZDS. 
However, the decision was not influenced by Slota, Slavkovska 
said.

<F P=106> ["Summary" in English: "Program Declaration of the Slovak </F>
Government"] 
  [Text] In 1994, the government wants to 
achieve zero growth of GDP, to keep inflation between 10 and 13 
percent, unemployment under 17 percent and maintain budget 
obligations. An increase in pure foreign exchange reserves is 
presumed so that the internal convertibility of the currency and 
positive payment balance would be maintained. The government 
will try to obtain a stand-by loan from the International 
Monetary Fund to enhance macroeconomic stability. The government 
also plans to create conditions that will facilitate the wider 
use of foreign sources toward developmental aims. 
  In 1993, the GDP in Slovakia dropped by 4.1 percent compared 
to the previous year. The state budget deficit grew to Sk23 
billion ($697 million), representing 6.8 percent of GDP. 
Compared to 1992, exports have fallen by 11.5 percent and 
imports have risen by 15.4 percent, despite the devaluation of 
the Slovak crown. This leaves Slovakia with a passive balance of 
trade valued at Sk26.7 billion ($809 million). 
  The clearing exchange with the Czech Republic accounted for 
Sk5.8 billion ($176 million) of the passive foreign trade 
balance. Unresolved financial obligations in the public sector 
including health care, transport and education were not included 
in the state budget deficit in 1993, thus adding Sk6 billion 
($182 million) to the 1994 budget. 
  In 1993, the increase of prices climbed to 23.2 percent 
which 
in comparison to price increases of 1992 is more than double. 
Unemployment rose to 14.4 percent by the end of 1993. 
  The previous government did not take definite steps for 
stabilization and support in small business development, 
resulting in 57.5 percent companies in the red at the end of 
1993 with a total loss of Sk42.5 billion ($1.29 billion). The 
previous government also is responsible for weakening foreign 
investment, particularly by not securing the necessary economic 
stability. At the end of 1993, the amount of foreign investment 
was Sk10.8 billion ($327 million), which was Sk4.2 billion ($127 
million) more than in 1992. But excluding the capital of Czech 
investors, the increase was only Sk3 billion ($90 million). 
  During the six-month mandate period, the government wants to 
speed up the process of economic transformation, especially 
regarding ownership matters. Privatization will be renewed with 
the previously successful voucher privatization process, which 
has earned the trust of citizens. 
  The government considers the renewal of trust in the 
privatization process to be of utmost importance for both 
citizens and foreign investors. By the end of the second wave of 
voucher privatization, more than half of all properties under 
state ownership should be in private hands. 
  The government will provide for the fairness of 
privatization 
methods among the participants and make the process clear for 
all. As opposed to the previous government, which considered the 
voucher privatization a residual method and delayed its 
preparation, the current government will approach it as an equal 
to other privatization methods. All branches of the economy will 
participate in voucher privatization, including many attractive 
investment opportunities. 
  The government will try to hasten the sale of shares held in 
the portfolio of the National Assets Fund (FNM). The FNM should 
only passively execute ownership functions in companies which 
have major private shareholders. 
  The government released this declaration with full knowledge 
that it has only a six-month mandate.

<F P=106> [Article by Kevin Drew: "Last-Place Slovakia Is Hoping to </F>
Gain Ground in Foreign Investment"] 
  [Text] Bratislava -- If foreign investment is seen as the 
engine of growth for the post-communist countries of Central 
Europe, Slovakia has sputtered in a wobbly start. 
  The republic lags far behind the other Visegrad countries 
(Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic) and Romania in the 
total amount of foreign investment it has attracted since the 
revolutions of 1989. And tiny Slovenia, a former member of the 
Yugoslav federation, is quickly catching up with Slovakia. 
  By the end of 1993, 10.8 billion Slovak crowns (Sk), or $366 
million, in foreign capital had come into the country. More than 
half that -- $220 million -- was made while the republic was 
part of Czechoslovakia. After the Czechoslovak split at the 
beginning of 1993, foreign investment dropped by 10 percent 
compared to the previous year. 
  All of this is despite the fact that Slovakia offers a 
well-trained labor force that is 10 percent cheaper than the 
Czech Republic's and 40 percent cheaper than Poland's. 
  Slovakia's problem is the image of political instability and 
stagnating economic reforms that have been created by widespread 
bureaucratic inefficiency and accusations of corruption in the 
privatization field that arose during the regime of recently 
ousted Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Government attempts to 
woo foreign investors by offering tax incentives and favoring 
trade sales over voucher privatization have not solved those 
problems. 
  But a new wave of optimism is filling the offices of 
government ministries. Many here hope that a turnaround in 
foreign investment can be put on track by year's end, thanks to 
a new government, headed by Jozef Moravcik, that has made 
economic reform the centerpiece of its policies. 
  "A lot of people thought our economy would collapse by now," 
said Anna Jostiakova, deputy minister in charge of foreign trade 
in the Economics Ministry. "It hasn't, and we think we're about 
to bottom out and begin to go forward." 
  The Moravcik administration's program makes foreign 
investment a cornerstone of its economic policies, said Marcela 
Sajtlavova, director of economic strategy and policy for the 
Economics Ministry. And to increase foreign investment, more 
companies must be privatized and released from government hands. 
  "The new economic program will be difficult to follow, but 
it 
is our best chance to attract foreign investors," she said. 
  The new government will get a chance to show off its 
programs 
in June, when about 20 leading U.S. business executives will 
tour the country under the auspices of the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. (OPIC), a semi-official U.S. agency aimed at 
spurring investment in developing economies. 
  Until now, Slovakia's biggest investors have been its 
closest 
neighbors: Nearly half of all foreign investment comes from 
Austrian and German enterprises, and the Czech Republic and 
Italy have invested more money than the U.S. into the republic. 
  The portfolios differ by country, as well. Austrian 
investment has for the most part focused on small and 
medium-sized enterprises. Most of the American money comes from 
the retail giant Kmart. 
  "The countries closest to us know us the best," said Michael 
Mraz, sales executive for the Slovak National Agency for Foreign 
Investment and Development. "The further away businessmen are, 
the more swayed they are by the country's image." 
  Mraz said foreign investors are beginning to consider doing 
business in Slovakia again. "The quantity and quality of 
foreign inquiries has been improving the past four months," Mraz 
said. "Investors are looking at long-term projects that will 
mean jobs for Slovaks." But Mraz added that despite the 
government's commitment to more foreign business, his office is 
painfully understaffed, causing a backlog of foreign inquiries. 
"We can't sit here in Bratislava and write letters and hope 
investors will come. If we are to attract the world, we will 
have to go to it."

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Not Enough"] </F>
  [Text] Bruntal -- It is a dark blemish on the otherwise 
sparkling economic performance of the Czech Republic. Isolated, 
undeveloped and depressed, the small north Moravian slice of 
land known as the Bruntal district has the highest level of 
unemployment in the country. 
  "It's desperate," said 18-year-old Jarmila Kuzelova as she 
stood outside the employment office of Moravsky Beroun, a 
deathly quiet town at the southern end of the district. "It's 
just catastrophic." 
  After graduating from school, Kuzelova worked as a waitress 
for 800 Kc ($27.50) a month, but quit that job when she realized 
she could be receiving monthly welfare payments of 1,300 Kc 
instead. But now she's had enough and wants out. Together with 
her husband, Kuzelova is moving to Mainz, Germany, where she has 
found work as a waitress. 
  "There's nothing here. I just want to leave," she said, 
echoing the pessimistic view of many people in the district. 
  In February, Bruntal's unemployment rate reached 9.4 
percent, 
a sharp contrast to the national rate, which remains a low 3.5 
percent. By the end of this year, the Bruntal employment office 
predicts a jobless rate of 11.16 percent. For more than two 
years, the largely agricultural Bruntal -- a district with only 
about 110,400 inhabitants -- has had the highest unemployment 
level in the country. Measures that have brought rapid economic 
growth to the rest of the Czech Republic have had little effect 
on this isolated region. 
  Hampered by a lack of basic infrastructure, such as a 
telephone connection to the outside world, the area is linked to 
the rest of the country only by a circuit of tortuous highways 
that wind through the region's rolling green hills. The 
exposure to a free market has bludgeoned Bruntal with massive 
layoffs at state farms and textile factories. 
  It was recently named one of four regions to receive a 150 
million Kc ($5.17 million) emergency job-creating state subsidy 
largely aimed at developing infrastructure and small business. 
To the skeptical people of this region, however, the subsidy is 
laughably meager. "Don't ask me if it's enough. Of course it's 
not enough," said Stanislav Navratil, the district chairman of 
Bruntal. 
  Sitting in his elegant wood-paneled office, Navratil added 
that he is suspicious of the economic development schemes 
hatched by Prague bureaucrats who know very little about the 
region's problems. A case in point is the Economics Ministry's 
plan to install a mobile telephone system in the district. 
  "These are political solutions. As a gesture it's fantastic, 
but it's not systematic," he said. Navratil worries that without 
a proper cable system, the mobile line will become jammed by 
people trying to phone outside the region. 
  As far as private investment is concerned, the region has 
fallen far behind the rest of the country, not only because poor 
infrastructure makes it highly unattractive to investors, but 
also because of unresolved and muddied ownership relations. 
Restitution in the district has been slower and more complex 
than almost anywhere else in the country. The root of the 
problem lies in Bruntal's recent history. Up until the end of 
the World War II, the region had a large Sudeten German 
population that had lived there for centuries. 
  When the postwar Czechoslovak government deported most of 
the 
Germans, so-called "gold miner" Czechs swept into districts like 
Bruntal to claim the deportees' property and homes. These 
people weren't familiar with the land, however, and the district 
quickly became a backwater of Moravia. 
  Today returning land to the Sudeten Germans is out of the 
question, and the mass migrations of people around the region in 
the postwar period has hopelessly entangled the process of 
restoring nationalized property to its original owners. The 
Order of German Knights, a charity organization comprised of the 
former nobility, has had its claim on large tracts of land in 
the district shuffled around the courts for months. 
  Added to this is the peculiar farm system used by the 
communist government in Bruntal. With low-quality land and a 
small, dispersed population, the typical collective farm system 
proved all but impossible to set up in the area. Instead a 
series of state-run farms was introduced, each saddled with 
managers from outside the region. That resulted in colossal 
losses as managers tossed money all over the region, confident 
the state would bail them out every time. 
  Today those state farms are stuck in limbo, because no one 
is 
willing to invest large sums of money to develop or modernize 
them before the crucial question of ownership is resolved. 
  Jaroslav Soural, an opposition deputy for the constituency 
of 
north Moravia, said at least some of the blame must also be laid 
on the current national government. "The Economics Ministry has 
turned its back on systemic solutions and has instead reacted to 
individual problems as they arise," said Soural, a member of the 
communist Left Bloc coalition. The first step, he said, would 
be the introduction of a responsible regional government system 
that would put elected officials in charge. Thus far, Prague has 
dragged its feet on establishing regional governments as called 
for by the Constitution. So Navratil's office functions like a 
bureaucratic department of the central government. 
  For all its problems, both Soural and Navratil see potential 
in the region once the restitution problems are set aside and 
real investment can begin slowly creeping into the region. 
Navratil talks of a "renaissance" in the local textile industry 
and of reviving the region's wood craftsmanship tradition, which 
was interrupted by the deportation of the Sudeten Germans. 
  He is also excited by a recently-signed cooperation accord 
that links the district with the German region of Wettrau. 
"We're saying that we are ready to take far more responsibility 
for our own development," he said confidently. 
  But out in the dozens of small towns and villages that dot 
the district, a different mood has begun to take hold. 
  "Everything is going downhill," said Jiri Bartu, a 
28-year-old resident of Moravsky Beroun. Bartu runs his own 
trucking company, but lately he has had difficulty getting some 
of his local customers to pay their bills. 
  "And I don't believe it will somehow turn around for the 
better. On the contrary, it will just continue going downhill."

<F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Too Many Jobs"] </F>
  [Text] When Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus told industrialists 
April 10 that one of his "post-transformation" goals is to see 
unemployment rise by about 0.1 percent per month, he most 
certainly had in mind Prague, where employers have been loudly 
complaining that they can't find help. 
  At the same time, Klaus' government was putting together 
rescue packages for less economically advanced regions of the 
country that are being crippled by the opposite problem: rising 
unemployment. 
  Bridging the gap between these extremes, while making the 
job 
market more competitive by raising overall unemployment, will be 
one of the major tasks of the Czech government and business 
leaders over the next few years. 
  The Czech Republic's remarkably low overall unemployment 
rate 
has long been the envy of all Europe. Currently at about 3.5 
percent -- representing 180,000 people -- the rate is expected 
to rise to between 4.5 and 5 percent by the end of 1994. 
  The statistics are telling. In March, unemployment in Prague 
stood at 0.3 percent, with the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs estimating that for every worker in the city there are 
eight job possibilities. But in the most depressed areas outside 
the capital, unemployment has exceeded 8 percent, and the 
government has recently been compelled to offer a program of 
state subsidies for local industry and infrastructure in the 
country's four worst-hit regions, three of which are located in 
Moravia. 
  The phenomenon of an east-west imbalance in national 
employment is not a new one. According to Vladimir Rudolf, 
deputy director of employment policy at the Ministry of Labor 
and Social Affairs, in the Czechoslovak First Republic 
(1918-1938), the areas of fullest employment were also in the 
western and central parts of Bohemia, close to the centers of 
Czech and German industry and trade. The poorest regions have 
always tended to be in the east, close to the Polish and Slovak 
borders. 
  Investment is now generally following this traditional 
route, 
which has its source in the wealth of Germany and Austria. Many 
areas of eastern Moravia remain in dire need of support, while 
the Bavarian border is a veritable flood plain of German 
affluence, lined with plush new restaurants, high-tech gas 
stations and shops. A Czech-German agreement allows Czechs to 
seek better-paying jobs in Germany within a 50-kilometer strip 
along the border. For the Bavarians, this constitutes a cheap 
but legal source of imported labor. 
  The same phenomenon has an equal and opposite effect on the 
Czech-Polish border, where Czech entrepreneurs find cut-rate 
workers from nearby Polish industrial cities. In these areas of 
stagnation, where unemployment sometimes reaches 20 percent, 
Poles and Ukrainians find good work for good wages, by their 
standards. Meanwhile, an increasingly dejected local population 
cannot get to work because of rising transportation costs, poor 
bus and rail connections and the collapse of communist-era 
single-factory communities. Agricultural regions have also been 
hard-hit by foreign competition and modernization. 
  Rudolf said that Czech psychology also plays a role in the 
stagnation of various regions. 
  "For many decades, Czechs were unaccustomed to relocating to 
be near their workplaces, as Americans regularly do," he said. 
"Now inhabitants of Kladno prefer to pick up welfare checks 
rather than come to Prague to work." He admitted that, due to 
the chronic housing shortage in Prague, provincial victims of 
unemployment find moving to the capital nearly impossible. 
  The increasingly difficult situation on the country's 
eastern 
borders is forcing people to re-evaluate their lifestyles. Now 
many Moravians are starting to migrate west, renting holiday 
cottages in the resort-heavy Sumava and Krkonose areas, near the 
German border, and working across the border. 
  The former East German border is less desirable, with 
unemployment as high as 10 percent in the old socialist state. 
The Austrian border is also less inviting: Relations between 
Prague and Vienna remain tense, with no signed guest-worker 
agreements and an Austrian law limiting to 10 percent the ratio 
of foreigners in the work force. 
  For the fortunate minority of unemployed, benefits start at 
60 percent of the average income for the first three months, 
then go down to 50 percent for the second three months. If the 
claimant is still jobless, means testing is applied to determine 
the sum for state support, with a minimum amount set at 2,300 Kc 
($79) per month. As part of the government's plans to kick start 
depressed areas, this benefit will be paid directly to employers 
using previously jobless workers. 
  "We prefer active, preventive measures to passive support of 
idle workers," said Rudolf. 
  An employee at the Economics Ministry said that the need to 
bolster the regions economically had forced Klaus to detour from 
his oft-stated policy of laissez-faire economics, because the 
high rate of unemployment in the country's four worst-hit areas 
seemed likely to induce nostalgia among voters for a command 
economy. 
  The ministry worker said he thought that the 150 million Kc 
($5.2 million) recently earmarked for regional development in 
the Moravian areas of Bruntal, Novy Jicin, Znojmo and the north 
Bohemian city Louny represents an important first step in 
rejuvenating local economies but will not be enough in the end. 
"We would need to invest at least four times as much," the 
ministry employee said. 
  Jana Petrova, spokeswoman for Klaus' Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS), the main member of the government coalition, said the 
amounts reserved are not optimal, but are all that can be spared 
at present. She said that the Czech Republic is too integrated 
to be split by uneven regional development. 
  Rudolf also said he is confident that the recovery package, 
called the Region Program, constitutes a good start. But one of 
its drawbacks may be that it only deals with areas exceeding 8 
percent unemployment, he said. 
  "There are unfortunately another nine areas with 7 percent 
or 
over," he said. "These could be jealous of those areas targeted 
for aid." 
  If the scheme proves successful, it will lessen the 
geographical divide that is threatening to cleave the country on 
an east-west basis. If the regional economies cannot be brought 
more closely in line, experts warn that the Czech Republic 
could, like France, develop a head that is too large for its 
underdeveloped body. 
  But in Prague, with its job surplus, the unemployment 
problems seem as far away as the moon. Ludmila Hilova, personnel 
manager at Krone, one of city's largest department stores, faces 
a special set of problems with the store staff about 80 workers 
short. 
  The problem goes beyond simple city-wide overemployment: 
Some 
small stores are overpaying employees by up to 1,000 Kc ($34) 
per month, Hilova estimated. Some of these can afford to do so 
because they have had buildings restituted to them and have few 
overhead costs to cover, while others deal in the abundance of 
contraband, duty-free goods that regularly enter the country. 
  But Hilova said the costs of higher wages have caught up 
with 
many bigger businesses. "Large, reputable stores cannot afford 
to do this, although we have the advantage of being more stable 
in times of economic hardship."

  [Text] Prishtina, June 4 (ATA) -- The recent campaign of 
barbarian attacks of the Serbian authorities and violence 
against the Kosova institutions and against all the Albanian 
organizations, accompanied by detention, imprisonments and 
sentences have caused indignation and protest all over Kosova. 
  The common message of all those protests and reactions is to 
continue the work and the activity of institutions in the 
republic of Kosova against the persecutions, violence, grave 
conditions under the occupation and to continue persistently the 
development in other new fields of the institutional 
organization of the life. 
  The protests emphasise that the Serbian tendency for 
discriminating the activity of those institutions by calling 
them illegal and parallel only because they are legal and 
opposite to the violence organs, is unacceptable and fleeting. 
The organizing of the political, state, and institutional life 
in Kosova finds a complete support in the legal and natural 
right which is the political will of the Kosova people expressed 
in a democratic way by the referendum for independence, first 
pluralist, parliamentary, and presidential elections, as it is 
said in the reactions.

  [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- Representatives of the 
Albanological Institute received a letter from the so-called 
prefect of the Kosova circle, Milosh Simovio, addressed to the 
director of the institute Dr. Sadri Fetiu. The letter says that 
the decision on the conditions and sequestration of the building 
of the institute have been re-examined and as a result the 
previous decision taken is invalid. According to the letter, 
the present user of the building of the Albanological Institute 
should evacuate the building until June 10 this year to hand it 
to the Kosova circle. 
  After the building was sequestered from the institute and 
the 
Serbian violence, the Albanological Institute of Prishtina 
continued its work in a private building.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nikolic] </F>
  [Excerpts] On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the 
Allied operation in Normandy, a celebration was held in the 
Central Club of the Yugoslav Army. Vladimir Nikolic reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Nikolic] The festivities were attended 
by Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic, Federal Foreign 
Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, Federal Defense Minister Pavle 
Bulatovic, members of the federal, republican, and city councils 
of the Federation of Associations of Veterans of the People's 
Liberation War [SUBNOR], and the military attaches of the 
British, French, and Russian Embassies in Belgrade. Although he 
was invited, the military representative of the U.S. Embassy in 
Belgrade failed to show up. [passage omitted] 
  After the gathering ended, we asked Foreign Minister 
Vladislav Jovanovic to assess this year's celebration of the 
Allied operation. 
  [Jovanovic] According to my feelings for history, this 
should have been the place to reaffirm -- in a very graphic and 
demonstrative way -- the unity in the struggle against fascism 
and all forces that participated in the struggle against fascism 
should have been here. That is why the back door invitation, so 
to speak, (?extended) to the SUBNOR representatives is not how 
the Yugoslav victims -- fighters against fascism -- deserve to 
be treated by the allies of yesterday, who have now become our 
opponents. On the other hand, not inviting Russia as the 
successor of the former Soviet Union is not very convincing. 
  [Nikolic] We also asked Minister Jovanovic to comment on the 
progress of the Geneva negotiations so far. 
  [Jovanovic] Everything is clear, everything is on the table. 
What we have been saying for a year, if not longer, has finally 
come to light. The Muslim side in Bosnia -- or more precisely, 
its fundamentalist leadership -- simply does not want the end of 
the war or peace. It wants war, or the peace that it would 
achieve through war. This means they are insisting on a unitary 
Bosnia and the full domination of the Croatian-Muslim element 
over the Serbs in Bosnia. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Miroslav Pisarevic] </F>
  [Excerpts] The 12th Congress of the Association of 
Independent Trade Unions of Yugoslavia has begun in Novi Sad. 
The motto of the congress is work, income, and social security. 
In addition to 200 delegates and some 50 domestic and foreign 
guests, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic 
also participated in the morning session. Miroslav Pisarevic 
reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Pisarevic] The congress began with the 
strains of The International and was opened by Grozdana 
Miljanovic, president of the 2-million-member organization. She 
stressed that the federal trade union had -- in the period 
between two congresses -- focused on the needs of the working 
masses and their families. The trade union has supported the 
program of the country's economic revival, said Miljanovic. 
[passage omitted] 
  The congress was also addressed by Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia President Zoran Lilic. He stressed that the congress 
is taking place at a time when our country is exposed to strong 
pressure, blackmail from abroad, and the economic blockade. 
  [Lilic] We have been punished by a complete blockade and an 
attempt at absolute international isolation because we have 
chosen negotiations as a way out of the crisis in the former 
Yugoslavia, because we have chosen a political solution and 
peace, rather than the way of terror and violence. A way which, 
unfortunately, has in many ways been paved by the international 
community itself, with its diffidence and inclination toward the 
extortionist demands of the Muslim fundamentalists. The 
unjustified and inhuman sanctions -- which, alas, we must always 
mention, and this gathering here today is no exception -- such 
as have never been implemented against a single country in the 
international community, have been imposed against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia based on false accusations. Today, many 
former politicians that directly participated in the breaking up 
of Yugoslavia openly admit this and justify it by saying that it 
was carried out under pressure and without an objective 
assessment of the realistic situation in the former Yugoslavia. 
  [Pisarevic] The economic situation in the country was 
particularly difficult toward the end of last year. However, we 
soon successfully started implementing the new economic program, 
President Lilic said, and added. 
  [Lilic] I would venture to say that the program, which was 
already discussed here a short while ago, is proof of our 
strength, our perseverance, and our vitality. A growing number 
of countries throughout the world are showing interest in the 
Yugoslav program and the results that have been achieved so far. 
The people that imposed the sanctions expected a breakdown of 
the political, economic, cultural, scientific, and all other 
life in Yugoslavia. To put it succinctly, they expected complete 
capitulation. Instead, something unprecedented in economic 
theory has happened. In place of the desired chaos, we have 
attained a firm dinar, eliminated the hyperinflation, pared the 
money emission down to realistic [word indistinct], and 
stabilized the prices and the realistic exchange rate of the 
dinar. The Yugoslav dinar on the world exchanges -- and I 
especially want to stress this here today -- is a language that 
the Western world, particularly the Western business community 
on which the world rests, understands very well. 
  [Pisarevic] We are glad that we can defend the sovereignty 
and integrity of Yugoslavia with a strong dinar, stressed Lilic, 
and added. 
  [Lilic] The most important thing for our economic and every 
other form of prosperity is to turn our attention to work and 
knowledge and first search here for solutions to our problems. 
That is why the implementation of the program is our collective 
work and mutual responsibility. More order and more work in our 
economy, in these complex circumstances, and the mobilization of 
all forces for reviving the economy, as stipulated by the 
program [sentence as heard]. It is only through our work and 
knowledge, and the rational and effective use of our own 
potential, that we can attain the position that is rightfully 
ours among the countries of the world. The basic thing is to 
believe in ourselves, to know what we want, and to have the 
strength to actually achieve it. [end recording]

  [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- The trial of ten former 
senior officials of the Albanian communist system accused of 
misappropriation of the state property in great proportions in 
cooperation and of abuse of office still in cooperation, 
continued on June 3 with questions to the witnesses. 
  Only eight out of 137 witnesses brought their testimonies 
before the court on June 3. Their testimonies were related with 
the "incident" in the Russian Embassy, an event for which the 
communist government executed without trial 22 intellectuals and 
imprisoned scores of others unjustly. They also spoke about the 
way the commissions for deportions and concentration camps 
functioned. 
  The first to be interrogated from the witnesses was the 
former attorney general in 1951, Siri Carcani. "I have only 
signed what was brought to me from above, without knowing 
anything concretely," Carcani declared. 
  The other witness, Rasim Dedja, former deputy chairman of 
the 
Second Interior Branch, said that the lists of those to be 
executed or imprisoned for the "incident" in the embassy were 
formulated by the premier of that time, Mehmet Shehu. 
  Former judge of the Supreme Military Court of that time, 
Vangjel Kocani, in the capacity of a witness, declared in the 
court that under instructions from senior bodies he had only 
signed the court decision after the 22 intellectuals had been 
executed. 
  Notes from the meeting on the incident held by the 
government 
at that time, Qemal Ceka, former stenographer, said at the 
court, are not mine but they are notes taken by the former 
secretary general of the Council of Ministers, Adil Carcani 
himself. 
  Former member of the CC [Central Committee] of the PLA 
[Albanian Workers Party] and former general director of the 
radio and television and later editor-in-chief of the newspaper 
ZERI I POPULLIT, Todi Lubonja, sentenced to 15 years of 
imprisonment by the communist regime for his liberal viewpoints, 
expressed his regret for the arrest of defendant Ramiz Alia. He 
said in his testimony that on the instruction of Alia, former 
reporter Xhelil Gjoni had written the first article against 
religion in Albania. (this article opened the way to 
anti-religious move in Albania in 1967.) 
  Due to their grave health problems, defendants Adil Carcani 
and Manush Myftiu asked through their attorneys to leave the 
courtroom, and their request was accepted. The next session of 
the trial will continue on June 4 with the questioning of other 
witnesses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of economic </F>
coordination, strategy, and reform, by Gheorghe Cercelescu; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Cercelescu] Mr. Minister, the government has 
finally decided to accelerate the process of privatization, 
which in Romania has been lagging behind quite a bit. What has 
led to the abandonment of the temporizing policy practiced thus 
far? 
  [Cosea] Both the slow pace and the shortcomings to date in 
the privatization process have obviously influenced our 
decision. But what made us act now was the desire not to let 
the opportunities of the moment go unused. We have reached a 
stage whereby we managed to score some results in the overall 
stabilization of the economy, thanks to certain monetary 
measures. However, these results are very fragile and their 
consolidation cannot be ensured without key actions in the real 
economy. 
  In our opinion, the most important measure in this respect 
is 
the privatization, which will lead to changes not only in the 
form of ownership, but also in the structure of the economy, 
primarily industry. Without such a change, we cannot relaunch 
production on sound bases. We also took into consideration the 
fact that the acceleration of the privatization process will 
consolidate the progress already made and will also help us make 
further headway. Through such an action we leave out a good 
part of the state sector -- which is a frenetic user of public 
moneys -- from the 1995 budget. The results thus obtained will 
allow us to direct our attention to other sectors of the reform 
-- such as education, health, and culture -- which we have 
failed to tackle so far because of the lack of financial means. 
  [Cercelescu] How is the mechanism for speeding up 
privatization conceived? 
  [Cosea] Our program relies on two pillars, namely involving 
the population in the process of privatization of the 
enterprises through ownership certificates and large-scale 
privatization. More than two years ago, the people received 30 
percent of the state's assets free of charge, but only on paper. 
Now, the holders of these certificates are going to change them 
into shares and thus effectively become owners of the respective 
enterprises. Some 3,000 trade companies will be privatized in 
1994. They will be presented to the public not only nominally, 
but also through a "visit card," which we will issue in order to 
enable everybody to form an opinion about each and every 
enterprise. Therefore, the citizens will be able to acquaint 
themselves with the social capital value of the respective 
enterprise, its business turnover in the past three years, its 
export activity, its main field of activity, the nominal value 
of a share, the overall number of shares, and the profit levels 
as a function of the business figures and social capital of that 
enterprise. 
  The citizens have 30 days to choose their preferred 
enterprises. Their choice will be written down in a printed 
option form, which will be directly sent to the respective 
company. The active personnel and the pensioners of the 
respective enterprise have priority at the exchange of 
certificates for shares. The shares will not be printed on 
paper, but we will use -- as everywhere else in the market 
economies -- dematerialized shares, that is computer-registered 
shares. However, the people who have exchanged their 
certificates for the shares will receive a written document 
attesting to the fact that they are shareholders. 
  In this connection, I would like to make the following 
clarification: The exchange of certificates for 30 percent of a 
given enterprise's shares will not bring money to the respective 
enterprise. The only way in which the privatized enterprises 
can acquire further capital is by selling the rest of the 70 
percent of their shares, which thus becomes part of the 
large-scale privatization -- whereby the employees and 
pensioners of the respective enterprises again enjoy priority in 
the acquisition of shares. 
  [Cercelescu] Certain developments have taken place between 
the time when the people received these ownership certificates 
and the time of their utilization, something which has 
substantially influenced both their value and distribution. How 
will these abnormal situations be solved? 
  [Cosea] The most delicate problem is that of the value of 
these certificates. We now have two values: The value given by 
the nonorganized market, which is between 10,000 and 15,000 lei 
for each certificate, and the value given by the Private 
Property Fund [FPP], which is in excess of 170,000 lei. In both 
cases, the value is underestimated. This can be easily proved. 
For example, if we just take the 170,000 lei value of the 
certificate, the total number of certificates does not cover the 
30 percent of the social capital, but much less -- according to 
certain calculations, it only covers 8-9 percent of it. We have 
a very simple method to calculate the value of a certificate as 
closely as possible to the current situation prevailing in the 
economy: We divide the 30 percent value of the social capital 
as it was on 31 December 1993 by the overall number of 
certificates issued. We will thus obtain a much higher value 
than is the case now and, what is more, it will be the same for 
everybody. 
  As a matter of fact, the acceleration of the privatization 
process will be achieved by granting equal changes to everybody, 
from the very beginning, in the most open way possible. This is 
what we had in mind when we established the principle of one 
certificate per person and enterprise. There have been many 
social complaints about the inequalities created by the 
concentration of an important number of certificates in the 
hands of certain persons or legal entities. In order to reduce 
inequalities, at least in the current stage of the process, a 
citizen can only choose one certificate per enterprise. If he 
has more certificates, he can go to other companies, but also 
with a single certificate, something which will disperse his 
capital. 
  [Cercelescu] Some of the enterprises put out for 
privatization will be very profitable and most of the people 
will be attracted to them, rather than go to the other ones. 
What will happen if the exchange options exceed the 30 percent 
free-of-charge part? 
  [Cosea] At the enterprise level, one will be able to go up 
to 50 percent of the social capital, following that the State 
Property Fund [FPS] and the FPP should agree on mutual 
compensations, so as to maintain the proportion of 30 to 70 
percent in the overall economy. I would like to add that there 
are also other ways of utilizing the ownership certificates. 
One is to entrust them to the FPP, which will administer them 
and pay dividends. Another possibility is to negotiate the 
certificates on the bonds market, which will appear concurrently 
with the start of the action of changing the certificates into 
shares. On such a market, the certificates can be sold or 
bought at prices fixed by the offer and demand. At the same 
time, one should take into consideration a possible second wave 
of privatizations scheduled for the start of next year -- on the 
basis of the same procedure -- when further enterprises will be 
privatized, as well as those enterprises left untouched by the 
first wave. Until then, the list of the 3,000 enterprises 
scheduled to be privatized in the first wave will be finalized 
in June; the media will disseminate the action throughout July; 
the offer will come out in August; and the exchange of the 
ownership certificates will begin on 1 September. We hope that 
a good part of the economy will be privatized by the end of the 
year, so as to be able to proceed more rapidly along the road of 
reform.

Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] 
  [Text] The monetary mass is also put under special 
pressure by its totally unequal distribution among the various 
categories of the population, that is, by the accentuated 
polarization of the money. One of the poles consists by a 
restricted number of physical and, especially, juridical 
persons, who over the past four years have accumulated a huge 
amount of money. Above all this refers to state-owned public 
corporations and companies, various private firms, certain 
producers, and various Romanian and foreign businessmen. There 
are a few dozen billionaires and several tens of thousands of 
millionaires. Anticipating the catastrophic collapse of the 
leu, they placed their money into hard currencies, buildings, 
real estate, automobiles, and various other highly valuable 
goods. A significant part of the money they invested in such 
goods has never returned to the economic circuit. 
  The other pole is represented by the almost 20 million 
people 
owning no money reserves at all, who can hardly afford to buy 
the most necessary things they need (food, clothes, shoes, and 
so on). Thus, all other goods manufactured by domestic industry 
are not intended for these layers of the population and 
therefore they cannot be sold, as they are not attractive for 
the rich either. This also aggravates inflation. The 
polarization of the money explains the paradox represented by 
the fact that there was a large monetary mass on the market, 
which meanwhile has been turned into goods, while the majority 
of the population still went down to the limit of absolute 
poverty. 
  The polarization of money also caused the polarization of 
assets. The polarization of money is a factor causing the acute 
growth of inflation. As the indexation of salaries and pensions 
cannot keep pace with the rate of inflation, the polarization of 
money is intensifying dramatically, which generates social 
tension the consequences of which are hard to be predicted. 
  The executive ignores this grave phenomenon of polarization 
of money and assets. The "evil" thing is not the fact that some 
persons have become billionaires or millionaires who could 
invest their money in productive activities, thus absorbing a 
significant part of the unemployed coming from the state-owned 
sector. The "evil" thing about it is the existence of 20 
million people living in poverty, which was caused by stagnation 
in industrial production, agriculture, and investments. Thus, 
the polarization of the money is the consequence of the economic 
blockage, which permanently generates a financial and monetary 
blockage as well. 
  The state budget deficit is a source of inflation, which it 
generates by spending money that is not properly covered by the 
state's incomes. Even if later they find ways to cover the 
deficit, until they do it the deficit makes them have uncovered 
money, that is, money printed without any economic foundation. 
  Spending for consumption beyond the limits of the state 
budget is directly causing inflation, as the money they issue 
never returns to the circuit of production. Such is the case of 
the subsidies granted to the mining sector. 
  The indexation of salaries made from the state budget (in 
the 
administration apparatus, education, health, culture, and so on) 
increases the state budget deficit, as the state has no other 
appropriate income sources to cover up for the money. 
  The exceeding of the limits established in the state budget 
in areas other than that of investments also causes inflation. 
The negative consequences of such spending upon the monetary 
circulation can only be annihilated when the projects begin 
producing, which usually happens several years after the money 
was invested. This is the case of the Krivoy-Rog project, in 
Ukraine, in which over $600 million were invested until the end 
of 1992 and for which, in 1993, a further 120 billion lei and, 
in 1994, a further 120 billion lei were allotted. A similar 
situation is to be found in the case of the Bucharest--Constanta 
freeway, for which they spent 17 billion lei from the budget, 
after which work was halted owing to lack of funds. This will 
delay the inauguration of that freeway and, implicitly, the 
return to the economic circuit of the money that was already 
invested. 
  The originally expected budget deficit of 430 billion lei in 
1993, which was later modified to 800 billion lei, also means 
inflation. Regardless of whether one has to deal with the 
initially expected budget deficit, the modified one, or the one 
actually registered in the end, in all instances the state 
budget deficit causes inflation. Currently it is even the 
principal source of inflation. This is why both the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank watch the 
evolution of the state budget deficits of the countries they 
offer assistance to so closely, including Romania. The state 
budget deficit is a key performance criteria reflecting the 
actual stage reached in the recovery of the economy or in its 
degradation, as in the case of Romania. 
  The programmed deficit over 1994 amounts to 1.9 trillion lei 
and this continues to generate inflation. This is why it is not 
recommendable that parliament should try to further augment the 
budget deficit. 
  Over the second half of 1993, the executive took certain 
measures that also increased inflation. First, they 
reintroduced the initial customs taxes, thus eliminating the tax 
reductions and exemptions on certain products. This made the 
price of those products go up. Beginning with 1 May 1993, even 
staple foodstuffs were subject to high customs taxes, usually 25 
percent, which increased costs and their retail price. Let 
alone the fact that they also introduced customs taxes for 
products that are not manufactured in the country at all, which 
is clearly an aberrant thing. 
  An important increase in costs and retail prices was caused 
by the introduction, beginning with July 1993, of the 
value-added tax [VAT]. In the case of a great number of 
products of services that previously used to be subject to 
turnover taxes of 1, 3, or 5 percent, the VAT, which amounts to 
18 percent, significantly increased their costs and prices. 
Previously, under the circumstances of a 1-percent turnover 
tax, if a product changed hands five times, the total sum of 
taxes amounted to 5 percent. Even if the turnover tax amounted 
to 3 percent, in the end it amounted to 15 percent, which is 
still less than the VAT applied only once. The introduction of 
the VAT for imported products, including foodstuffs, made their 
prices skyrocket, thus aggravating inflation. 
  The introduction of increased customs taxes and the 
subsequent introduction of the VAT had an inhibiting effect, as 
customs taxes of 25 percent plus the VAT amounting to 18 percent 
made the price of imported goods increase by 43 percent, which 
discouraged imports. Considering the current state of economic 
regression, the 18-percent level of the VAT is totally 
exaggerated, let alone the introduction of VAT in the domain of 
energy and fuel imports, which is wrong, as it further increased 
their already high prices so that both companies and the 
population find it increasingly difficult to pay for them. 
  The same inflationist effect was caused by the introduction 
of very high profit taxes in the case of a large number of 
important products. 
  If one added the 45-percent profit taxes to the customs 
taxes 
and the VAT, one will clearly see that the tax policy applied by 
the Vacaroiu government is a repressive, rather than a 
stimulating one. 
  The grave consequences of the measures taken in 1993 are 
quite obvious, because as a consequence of them, the price of 
the great majority of products and services increased two or 
three times. Such products are: meat, sugar, edible oil, rice, 
wheat flour, coffee, cigarettes, electric power and heating, 
public transportation, and interurban transportation. In the 
years 1990 to 1992 there was no similar shock. For the 
population this was tantamount to a genuine disaster, as the 
50-percent indexation of salaries and pensions could not 
reimburse the 300-percent increase in the prices of products and 
services weighing heavily on their household budgets. It was 
admitted unanimously that inflation got out of control beginning 
with the second half of 1993. As a matter of fact, a proportion 
of over three quarters of the 320-percent inflation registered 
in 1993 occurred during the second half of that year. 
  By applying such measures, the state budget was partially 
salvaged, as the state income became higher. However, this was 
possible only by the unprecedented increase of prices that made 
the standard of living drop drastically and that impoverished 
large categories of the population.

<F P=106> [Fourth of five installments of article by Alexandru I. </F>
Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] 
  [Text] Recent recommendations of the International 
Monetary Fund [IMF] and the World Bank laid a special emphasis 
on the reduction of the arrears. These are unpaid and overdue 
debts over many months, sometimes even years. Besides hindering 
production, the arrears cause great delays in the paying of 
debts toward suppliers, banks, the state budget, and so on. 
  Over the past years, the overall amount of money blocked in 
this way in our economy varied between 1 and 3 trillion lei. 
This is a monetary mass parallel to the monetary issue proper. 
The discount documents issued for money that has never been 
cashed in are actually unproductively piled up money. This 
artificially created monetary mass generates inflation because 
the initially blocked companies, as well as those subsequently 
blocked in a kind of a chain reaction resort to anti-economic 
steps in order to overcome the situation: They reduce 
production, personnel, and salaries, prefer to manufacture goods 
solely for export, and hoard the hard currency they earn. All 
this generates inflation. 
  Arrears are a breeding ground for inflation, because the 
money they represent, regardless whether they are debts to be 
paid or debts to be cashed, never returns to the monetary 
circuit. This is money that is actually buried in a genuine 
cemetery of dead money. The covering of arrears of any kind by 
taking or granting further bank loans represents inflation 
caused by inflation. It is tantamount to a genuine financial 
disaster. We resolutely assert this so that the grave mistakes 
made over the past years should not be made again. Because it 
is not the money that makes the economic situation recover, but 
rather the other way round, that is, a betterment can only be 
achieved by economic measures, above all by restructuring and 
re-equipping the economy. 
  Besides the state budget deficit and the arrears, the most 
grave current aspect of Romania's finances is represented by the 
huge volume of the so-called current bank loans, which cannot be 
paid back. This is a source of catastrophic inflation. 
Currently, the overall volume of bank loans amounts to 4 
trillion lei, which greatly exceeds the maximum limit 
established by the IMF, a limit which is considered by them as 
one of the performance criteria they expect us to comply with. 
That criteria was not imposed whimsically by those 
international financial and banking bodies, but rather by force 
of the objective fact that the loan bleeding also means 
inflation, as such money never returns to the circuit of 
production. 
  Out of the total amount of loans, worth 4 trillion lei, over 
3.5 trillion, that is, about 90 percent, was granted to the 
state-owned economic sector. Some of the public corporations 
and the state-owned companies that perform badly, lose money, 
produce for stockpiles, or work at low efficiency are unable to 
repay the loans they were given. In despair they plunge further 
into the red, because they take newer loans that are 
increasingly expensive. This may be regarded as a genuine 
cemetery of loans, which is continuously growing, and to which 
also the due interest ought to be added, which currently amounts 
to about 250 billion lei per month. 
  The growth of inflation, as well as the danger of being left 
without capital made the BNR [Romanian National Bank] increase 
the interest rate of loans granted in auctions to 120 percent 
and the interest rate of the so-called overdraft loans to 250 
percent. The other banks cannot reactivate the loans taken 
previously and therefore they are compelled to take new loans 
from the BNR at a 250 percent interest rate, which they cannot 
possibly pay back. Under such circumstances, the latest 
restrictive measures and the increase of the interest rates 
block economic activity more and more severely. 
  Currently all ways to finance economy by means of loans are 
quite discouraging, because the loans granted in auctions are 
offered for merely a few weeks, while in case of the overdraft 
loans obtained from the BNR, the commercial banks apply an 
interest rate amounting to 260 percent. Under such 
circumstances, merely a few hundred million lei's worth of loans 
at a 260 percent interest rate were taken, which is very little 
compared to the companies' desperate need for funds. 
  Worried by the rate of inflation, not only companies, but 
also banks began to invest their own financial resources in 
buildings, automobiles, and other highly valuable goods, which 
further reduced their resources to be used to offer loans. The 
banks' fear of losing their capital is a far graver phenomenon 
than the paralyzing of the economy by prohibitive interest rates 
and the cessation of new loans owing to the lack of capital. 
  Under the circumstances of the rampant increase of the 
inflation rate, the excess amount of money existing on the 
market cannot be absorbed by the issuing of state bonds or other 
similar things, such as the shares of privately owned companies. 
This is why the state failed when it issued bonds trying to 
borrow money from the population and companies in an attempt to 
cover the budget deficit to curb inflation. Each time they 
tried, they failed because only a handful of persons were 
willing to invest money in slips of paper the value of which was 
continuously dropping and their refund date for which lies years 
away. 
  Besides, why should the citizens and the companies trust the 
correctness of the state's policy, after they got used to their 
hard currency being confiscated, the leu's exchange rate being 
arbitrarily established, and their salaries and pensions being 
indexed in a proportion that by far does not cover the price 
hikes and the increase in taxes, fees, and the suffocating 
interest rates? Those who today own bonds issued in the 
previous years by the state are currently struggling to regain 
their money, as the amounts they invested have depreciated 
gravely. The same lack of confidence of the citizens and 
companies made the National Road Administration refrain from 
issuing bonds so that it could pay back to the state the 
14-billion-lei loan it had been given from the state budget for 
the initial works on the Bucharest-Constanta freeway, although 
Government Decision No. 472 of 29 August 1993 stipulates the 
issuing of such bonds. 
  In order to make bonds more attractive, not only the 
interest, but also the invested money should be periodically 
indexed on the basis of the evolution of the lei-dollar exchange 
rate. But who would venture to do such a thing over many years 
in the name of the state, which is accustomed to always gaining 
and never losing money in its economic relations with companies 
and citizens? 
  The shares issued by certain privately owned companies also 
have a limited scope, first because, in our country, there is 
still no stock exchange market where one can trade one's shares 
freely; second, because the stock companies do not offer 
sufficient shares because they cannot offer annual dividends 
that exceed the 100 percent interest rates paid by the BCR 
[Romanian Commercial Bank] or the Agricultural Bank. 
  Generally speaking, bonds and shares, regardless of whether 
they have been issued by the state, private companies, or banks, 
cannot absorb the inflation. 
  The fact that bonds and shares, under the circumstances of 
the decline of economy, are inefficient means to curb the 
aggressive growth of inflation is also proved by the fate of the 
so-called property vouchers, which were handed out to the almost 
16 million adult citizens of Romania. Considering the value of 
140,000 lei attributed by the state to each of those vouchers, 
the whole amount exceeds 2.2 trillion lei. However, owing to 
the fact that the vouchers cannot be used as shares of very 
profitable companies, their actual value is much lower than the 
one attributed to them by the state. This is proved by the fact 
that in railway stations and markets people offer them for sale 
for a few thousand lei. Let us not deceive ourselves: We have 
always been and continue to be owners of mere slips of paper. 
The ridiculous dividend amounting to 400 lei offered for each 
share of the Cluj-based Ursus company -- the first company that 
ever issued shares to the population -- clearly reveals the fate 
of the property vouchers when they are turned into company 
shares.

Mihail: "Concerted Fire Upon the Leu"] 
  [Text] Owing to the fallacious economic-financial policy 
conducted over the past four years, currently, and in the near 
future, the leu is under the pressure of a mass of over 10 
trillion lei. This inflationist mass has been caused by the 
1993 budget deficit which exceeded 800 billion lei to which the 
budget deficit of 1994 may be added, programmed to rise to 
almost 1.9 trillion lei. The same kind of inflationist money is 
represented by the over 350 billion lei's worth of nonperforming 
loans granted over 1990 that was transferred to the public debt. 
That was another antireform measure intended to further 
weakened the leu in an attempt to continue to protect the 
state-owned economic sector. 
  The leu is also under the pressure of the major part of the 
4 
trillion lei worth of loans which have been granted to 
state-owned companies. These companies have their hands full 
trying to buy raw materials and pay for the energy, fuel, 
salaries, and so on, while the money they earn by selling their 
products is totally insufficient to pay back the loans. Aside 
from this, a part of those loans was and still is used to 
manufacture goods that are sold at a loss or remain unsold, on 
stocks. This is a genuine cemetery of loans that paralyzes 
economic activity, because the banks are unable to regain and 
reuse that money. The recommendation recently made in Bucharest 
by the head of the IMF delegation to reroute a part of the loans 
currently held by the state-owned sector to private companies 
may be followed only if a significant number of state-owned 
companies are closed, an inconceivable thing for the executive. 
  Another thing that is exerting pressure upon the leu is the 
continuation of the production for stocks, which is proved by 
the fact that over the first four months of 1994 the stocks of 
unsold goods have increased by 10 percent. 
  Arrears (unpaid investments and debts among companies) worth 
about 2.8 trillion lei may be added to all this as buried money 
that has been taken out of the monetary circuit, which is a 
direct source of inflation. The salaries paid by state-owned 
companies, which lack the necessary financial resources to do 
so, also belong to the category of inflationist money. 
Furthermore, pressure is being exerted upon the leu also by the 
hard currency amount of about $800 million currently existing 
throughout the country (for which lei were spent) and which is 
hoarded up in the country or abroad by the companies that fear 
that the leu will further devaluate or that their money would be 
confiscated. A total mass of 10 trillion lei is thus putting 
the fragile leu under a tremendous pressure. As a matter of 
fact, the inflation rate of almost 230 percent registered in 
1993, which was 4 to 5 times higher than expected, fully attests 
the inflationist monetary mass currently existing in the country. 
  Parallel to all the aforementioned direct and immediate 
factors, our national currency is submitted to a latent and 
long-time erosion by the fact that poor quality products at 
exaggerated prices are still being produced (shoes, clothes, 
cosmetics, alcoholic beverages, cigarettes, soft drinks, radio 
and color television sets, and so on) that are surpassed by 
similar foreign-made products. The same goes for the extremely 
expensive and totally unsatisfactory quality of the services. A 
special pressure is exerted upon the leu by the high costs of 
energy, heating, telephone, and so on, which, together with the 
high food prices, exhaust the incomes of the large majority of 
the population and prevents it from buying non-edible products. 
  A similarly great pressure is exerted upon the leu by the 
avalanche of taxes, fees, the taxing of taxes, interests, 
commercial taxes, and so on, which artificially increase the 
price of products and services, at the same time also hindering 
economic activity. The accentuation of the polarization of money 
and assets, as a consequence of the economic blockage, turns a 
great number of workers, public servants, pensioners, and so on, 
into an immense mass of non-consumers of non-edible products. 
  The leu is also under the pressure exerted by the tremendous 
financial effort made to reimburse the due installments and the 
interests for the loans taken from abroad. The fact that the 
Romanian National Bank has been buying dollars for that purpose 
has a double inflationist effect, first because it is paying 
over 1,600 lei for $1, and second because thus it deprives the 
companies of the hard currency assets they would need for 
imports so that they can produce for export. 
  Such being the objective terms of our current 
economic-financial situation, the optimistic assessments made on 
the occasion of the signing of the accord with the IMF with 
respect to the efficiency of the measures intended to achieve 
economic restructuring and the boosting of privatization, 
including the measures to improve the tax and the banking 
system, lack any real basis. Our industrial potential, which 
has not been re-equipped over the past 20 years and which was 
further destroyed and submitted to decay over the past four 
years, cannot be mended within a few months. Promises made 
regarding the recovery of economy and the increase of our 
standard of living over the second half of 1994 lack any grounds. 
  In 1994 the Romanian economy needs about $7-8 billion for 
the import of the absolutely necessary quantities of energy, 
fuel, raw materials, equipment, and staple foodstuffs, as well 
as for the reimbursement of foreign loans and the payment of the 
interest. The Romanian economy is unable to produce that much. 
One feels powerless and bitter thinking that countries such as 
Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, South Korea, and so on, 
achieve exports worth $7-8 billion within only a few weeks! 
Whereas we are running about asking to be lent a few hundred 
million dollars, which momentarily eases our situation, but, in 
the long run, will be a new burden. In this context it seems at 
least strange the way in which the executive appreciates the new 
foreign loans we have been granted, while actually that money 
will make the situation even more difficult because our foreign 
debt will increase by about $1 billion. 
  On the other hand, we will be unable to comply with the 
objective criteria imposed by the IMF and the World Bank, namely 
the growth of the gross industrial product, the freezing of the 
state budget deficit at the established level, the observation 
of the established inflation rate limit and that of the total 
amount of money handed out as loans, the substantial reduction 
of arrears, and the diminishing of the deficit of the foreign 
trade balance of payments by making exports supersede imports 
and not by taking further foreign loans, as is being currently 
done. 
  The fact that we become indebted and have to pay hundreds of 
millions of dollars in order to partially better the balance of 
foreign payments, that is, to refund other debts and to 
consolidate the hard currency reserves of the country, is 
actually a failure, rather than a success. 
  After almost four years of great phrases about economic 
reform, today, everyone realizes that all these things cannot be 
achieved unless large-size state industry is privatized and 
unless foreign capital is attracted to re-equip our economy and 
make large-scale investments. The re-equipment of the industry 
alone would cost more than $20 billion. This requires a radical 
change in the current conceptions and legislation. Because no 
one wants to buy the assets held by the large state companies, 
which currently are assessed to be worth over 20 trillion lei, a 
value that with each new appraisal will continue to grow on 
paper, but not in reality. Besides this, great Western 
companies will never invest in Romania under the circumstances 
of the aggressive devaluation of the leu and the current 
regulations guaranteeing the security of the investment, land 
property, the recuperation of the investments in hard currency, 
and the duration of the recuperation. 
  However, the current authorities (the parliament, the 
presidency, and the executive) finds such radical changes 
inconceivable. Those authorities are also doing everything they 
can to block private initiative and property and to maintain and 
strengthen state property and the involvement of the state in 
the economy. That is why reform is not progressing at all, as 
the current authorities are unable to implement privatization 
and to achieve the restructuring of the economy, which are key 
elements of the reform. The [IMF] memorandum will appear in 
front of our eyes more like a mirage, because each day we are 
getting farther away from it, despite all the optimistic 
statements made by the executive. 
  The principal obstacle hindering the recovery of our economy 
is the lack of capital, and this problem will persist, because 
as long as there are no other cheap resources available, and 
depositors are paid 100-percent interest, our commercial banks 
will be unable to cut down the interest rates of the loans they 
grant, unless they are prepared to run the risk of losing their 
capital. Prices will continue to grow, inflation will increase, 
and the leu will not recover. Over the future months, they will 
partially or totally close down a great number of industrial 
units, as it will become impossible to provide them with energy, 
fuel, raw materials, and so on, because neither further 
subsidies from the state budget, nor further bank loans will be 
available for them. Even the companies that still have money 
and raw materials will be unable to sell their products for want 
of purchasers. The number of the unemployed will grow and the 
amount handed out to them as allowances will become merely 
symbolic. Owing to the lack of capital and clients and 
suffocated by high taxes, fees, and interest rates, numerous 
privately owned companies will cease activity. 
  All layers of the population will be affected, both the 
employees working in the state or private sectors and the ones 
working in the state administration, education, health, culture, 
and so on. Owing to lack of resources, it will become 
impossible to merely partially index salaries and pensions, as 
used to be done until now. 
  The year of 1994 will doubtlessly be the most difficult one 
of the transition period, with large-scale social convulsions 
caused by the accentuation of the economic crisis and general 
pauperization. All this will happen regardless of who holds 
power, as there are no short-term solutions to make the national 
economy and currency recover. The blocking of the reform costs 
and will continue to cost a great deal.

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Momcilo 
Perisic, Yugoslav Army chief of general staff [CGS], held a 
working meeting today with representatives of the Yugoslav media 
in the central Yugoslav Army Club. 
  "I am not asking you to depict the situation in the Yugoslav 
Army as being better than it really is," General Perisic told 
the correspondents. He urged the building of better mutual 
trust through various forms of cooperation. General Perisic 
recalled that not a single member of the Yugoslav Army is 
outside Yugoslav borders, except for diplomatic and consular 
missions of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia abroad. He added 
that the Yugoslav Army is not causing any incidents on the 
border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. These incidents, he explained, 
come as a consequence of an undefined internationally recognized 
border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. 
  The Yugoslav Army CGS also stressed that the process of 
depolitization of the Yugoslav Army has been completed, and 
spoke about the Army's high technical and technological level 
which has been maintained despite the sanctions.

<F P=106> [Article by M.M.: "Something Is Floating in the Water"] </F>
  [Text] The series of incidents in the parliament here was 
enriched last week (on Wednesday, 18 May) by the scandal in the 
parliament involving the spilling of water, shoving, and curses 
referring to the opponent's communist mother. When Drasko 
Markovic, deputy of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said 
something concerning the reputation of Dr. Radovan Bozovic, 
president of the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly of Yugoslavia 
-- more accurately, when in proposing an item on the agenda he 
mentioned Bozovic's involvement in the so-called ministerial 
scandal (stealing on a large scale involving two ministers of 
the Serbian Government, headed by Dr. Bozovic), which is still 
dragging on in the courts -- the latter turned off the 
microphone at the speaker's stand. 
  In the next scene, the president of the Citizens Chamber 
gestured to the Radical deputy to leave the speaker's desk, and 
the latter took a glass of mineral water (it must have been 
"Karadjordje!") and spilled it on the president's desk, but not 
so violently that it would splash the president of the Chamber. 
  Bozovic then obtained from the Chamber permission to eject 
the deputy from the Chamber. (Up to now deputies have been 
ejected without a vote.) 
  The chastised deputy first headed for the exit, and then, at 
the suggestion of the party's leader, he sat on a bench. The 
Radicals surrounded their colleague and did not allow the 
Assembly security to eject Markovic from the Chamber. There 
began a test of strength based on credentials--the Radicals 
referred to immunity, and the security personnel referred to the 
official order of the president of the Chamber. One security 
officer shouted: "Mr. Deputy, allow me to discharge my duty!" 
Seselj answered: "You are not going to discharge your duty!" 
  In the fistfight that ensued, Radical Deputy Filip 
Stojanovic 
got a bloody ear. Seselj shouted in a strong voice: "You have 
drawn the man's blood, damn your communist mother. To hell with 
Sloba Milosevic!" He advised his deputy to display his bloody 
handkerchief, and then, raising the temperature, he said that 
"half a liter of blood has been shed"; throughout the entire 
Chamber, he called to Radmilo Bogdanovic, chairman of the 
Security Committee: "Radmilo, see what your police are doing!" 
The latter, after sending a long and significant look in 
Seselj's direction, left the Chamber! 
  When passions cooled, the Radicals left the session, and the 
next day (Thursday, 19 May) they did not attend the debate 
concerning the new rules of the Assembly, when everyone was 
talking about the "dignity of the Assembly." 
  Incidentally, on two occasions before this incident Bozovic 
has left the session when Dr. Vojislav Seselj mentioned his 
involvement in criminal scandals. Exactly a year ago, an 
incident occurred in which Bozovic took the opposite tack. When 
Radical Deputy Vakic dealt a knockout blow to Deputy Mihajlo 
Markovic, Bozovic reacted in a manner well-disposed to Vakic. 
The Socialists were tolerant for a long time, they approved Dr. 
Seselj or encouraged him to do outrageous things in the Serbian 
and federal assemblies. Recently, they have been getting a 
little annoyed.

<F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Jovanovic: "Lack of Veneration"] </F>
  [Text] The murder of two soldiers of Serbian nationality 
the week before last, committed by Saban Bajram, an Albanian, 
only heightened the tensions and intensified the dilemmas over 
whether young men of the ethnic minorities should or should not 
be called up to do their required military service in the Army 
of Yugoslavia [VJ]. These questions are not, of course, anything 
recent, but the general development of the situation indicates 
that advocates of an ethnically pure (Serbian-Montenegrin) army, 
in view of recent tragic events, are gaining more and more 
adherents. The problem, however, is by no means a simple one: 
The FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Constitution 
establishes this as a civil state. And what is called 
"depoliticization and deideologization" of the Army is taking 
place, but what is happening is that one "belief" (brotherhood 
and unity) is being replaced by another (the ethnic belief). 
  It seems that the new Army also has problems in its 
inability 
to replenish its ranks solidly with military conscripts, which 
detracts essentially from combat capability. Speaking recently 
in VOJSKA about the "intolerably undermanned peacetime units," 
General Jevrem Cokic, commander of the 1st Army, says that the 
reasons are these: "The lack of veneration for the military 
calling, the poor functioning of the law-governed state, and the 
failure to take appropriate steps against those who have not 
discharged their civic duty, the departure of inductees abroad 
without the knowledge or approval of the competent regional 
military commands, evasion of the serving of the summons for 
induction, dishonest work by the PTT [postal, telegraph, and 
telephone service] as the entity responsible for delivering 
induction notices, uneven performance of the requests of 
regional military commands to apprehend draft dodgers by certain 
components of the MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], and 
draft-dodging by Skipetars and some Muslims and Hungarians. 
  Estimates of how many young men have evaded the draft by 
going abroad from Serbia and Montenegro go as high as 300,000 
"deserters." For a time, there was talk in "patriotic circles" 
about prohibiting these people from returning to the country. 
The situation, however, is no better here either: In the same 
statement, Gen. Cokic complained of the insufficient reporting 
of conscripts for military exercises, which in the 1st Army 
(Sumadija and Vojvodina) averages 36 percent; the general 
referred to Belgrade as "the weakest" within the territory under 
his jurisdiction--at a disastrous 17 percent! 
<H5>  Belgrade </H5>
  It seems that an attempt was made to resolve the issue of 
the 
draft by recruitment under contract, but there are many 
indications that this is going badly. In late 1993, they did a 
two-day analysis of annual operation in the command of the 
Podgorica Corps in which that corps' chief of staff, Colonel 
Momcilo Damjanovic, was to say: "There is an appreciable lack of 
interest on the part of some of the soldiers under contract, and 
256 such soldiers have been discharged in the past year on those 
grounds." 
  According to what many have said, this "lack of interest" 
consists of more frequent fights and drinking bouts, i.e., a 
considerable loss of discipline when soldiers under contract 
arrive. This makes it more difficult to maintain the already 
shaky authority of the officers. 
  One of the problems, it seems, is the food. Mento Mentovic, 
M.A., chief of the Food Service Department of the VJ, said 
recently in VOJSKA: "If regular inflow of budget funds is not 
furnished to feed the fighting men, there will be a further drop 
in the quality of the food.... Today, the energy value and 
biological value of the soldier's meal is on the lower limit of 
tolerance, and any further drop would adversely affect the 
health of the soldiers. 
<H5>  Bosnia </H5>
  But what perhaps disturbs the families of VJ recruits the 
most are the increasingly frequent stories about VJ forces 
crossing the Drina and taking part in the war in Bosnia. There 
is mention of death notices in the daily press, nighttime 
transports of bodies in metal caskets, overflowing hospitals in 
towns along the Bosnian border, and other details. There have 
been no official confirmations that such activities are taking 
place. It is thought, however, that the balance between the 
Serbian and Croatian "regular" participation in the Bosnian war 
certainly exists, and that there is a certain "threshold of 
tolerance" on the part of the western governments. 
  At least three questions arise with the most recent crisis 
around the northern corridor: Will the FRY enter the Bosnian war 
even officially, who would issue the order for such a move, and 
what would be the objectives of waging war in such an operation? 
Absolute chaos prevails here: The federal and Serbian 
Constitutions are at variance with respect to decisions on war 
and peace. Affairs of defense and warfare are the concern of the 
Serbian and federal presidents, the Defense Ministry, the 
Supreme Military Council, the federal government, and the 
parliament. In addition, of course, to the General Staff. 
  Additional confusion has come from the statement of Mr. 
Radmilo Bogdanovic, vice president of the Chamber of Republics 
and Provinces of the FRY Assembly, who many consider the 
unofficial chief of the Serbian police--who said that "a 
possible attack on Brcko would be proclaimed aggression, because 
that is a free Serbian city." But he did not go so far as to say 
whether the response would be the entry of Serbia and Montenegro 
into the war. 
  A possible mobilization in that connection, of course, would 
from the outset be deprived of the participation of the Muslims 
from the FRY and probably that of members of other ethnic 
minorities as well. On the other side, the response of the 
"Orthodox" population is also under a big question mark. The 
experiences of the war in Slovenia, and even more in Croatia, 
provide best evidence of that. 
  The uncertainty is great and the "manning of peacetime 
units" 
would perhaps be better if those who were suspicious saw that 
the wartime tasks of the VJ, that is, defensive tasks, end on 
the right bank of the Drina. The prospects of that are not great 
so long as there is shooting on the other side of the Drina.

<F P=106> [Text of interview with Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of </F>
the National Bank of Yugoslavia, by Jasna Kesic; place and date 
not given: "Monetary Projection Is a Devilish Thing"] 
  [Text] Very little is known about the monetary policy being 
conducted by the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia] these past 
months. Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, professor, has now been 
governor of the NBJ for two-and-a-half months, but it is 
difficult to escape the impression that during the whole time he 
has been much more concerned with carrying out the economic 
program than with his job as governor. That is why we asked him 
at the outset whether a projection of monetary policy had been 
adopted for the second quarter of this year, since half of that 
period has already passed. 
  "Let me say first that it is true that I have been involved 
with all kinds of things, but my legal responsibility is here in 
the NBJ, and any careful newspaper reader will see that I am 
very much involved in credit policy, in foreign-exchange policy, 
and so on. There are certain matters that I cannot fail to be 
involved with in the light of earlier history, and all those 
issues are related. You cannot examine credit policy without 
looking at budget policy, since these are two conflicting 
requirements," Dr. Avramovic explained. 
  "As for the projection of monetary policy, it was made last 
Tuesday evening in the federal government, but I am not at all 
enthusiastic about any projections. Monetary projection is a 
devilish thing, it depends on the rate of circulation of the 
money, and no one knows what the rate of circulation is. 
Accordingly, decisions on this have to be made from week to 
week, since our total supply of money in circulation is only 7 
to 8 percent of the national income. That is about 1,200,000,000 
dinars, of which about 360,000,000 have gone to the state to 
cover the budget deficit, about 300 million to buy foreign 
exchange, and all the rest to the economy." 
  [Kesic] Can this monetary policy which you are conducting be 
called "restrictive"? 
  [Avramovic] I have tried not to make it restrictive for the 
economy. We have managed to drop the interest rate from 30 
percent at the beginning of the program's implementation to 9 
percent. We will be restrictive when it comes to granting loans 
to the state, but monetary policy will be absolutely open when 
it comes to granting loans to the economy. 
  [Kesic] You announced that beginning in July the NBJ will no 
longer use primary note issue for credit to finance the deficits 
in the federal and two republic budgets. 
  [Avramovic] There is no primary issue for the state any 
more! 
Budgets will be replenished by borrowing on the capital market, 
but those amounts will be relatively modest. We want to put the 
state on notice that the NBJ cannot be its permanent banker. We 
have asked government bodies and agencies to prepare their 
projections for May, June, and July, and then we will see how to 
cover those deficits which they have, especially with respect to 
using commodity reserves. We are not going to kill the state, it 
is not a question of that, but it is a question of general 
priorities. I think that our credit policy should bring about a 
growth of production of 30 to 40 percent, and that will provide 
a solution to the budget problem, since fiscal revenues will 
increase 30 to 40 percent. That is the best way of replenishing 
the budget, not through direct deficit financing. 
  [Kesic] How independent is the NBJ in conducting monetary 
policy, especially when we know that the Serbian finance 
minister is a member of the bank's board? 
  [Avramovic] O.K., those are now new things which have come 
about. The most recent appointments in Serbia have altered 
relations on the board. It is obvious that now we must think 
about what we are going to do here next. But so far I have not 
had problems when it comes to the independence of the NBJ. 
  [Kesic] Is the NBJ board, which conducted monetary policy at 
the time when we had the highest inflation in the world, at all 
capable of conducting a policy of a stable exchange rate of the 
dinar? 
  [Avramovic] That is a hypothetical question. They were not 
the only people making decisions about monetary policy, there 
were general circumstances which brought that about. And you 
will understand me if I do not answer your question now. I can 
only say that Avramovic is independent in conducting monetary 
policy and that the NBJ is independent.

<F P=106> [Text of interview with Dr. Djordje Djukic, member of the </F>
Board of Governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, by Zoran 
Jelicic; place and date not given: "Justice and Economics"] 
  [Text] In the issue before last of VREME, we informed our 
readers of certain ideas launched in the closed meeting of the 
Economic Council of Serbia, including the fact that Dr. Djordje 
Djukic, member of the Board of Governors of the National Bank of 
Yugoslavia, spoke about the needs and opportunities for a 
partial revision of losses and gains to hyperinflation. Dr. 
Djukic felt that his presentation was incomplete, and was 
therefore inaccurately interpreted, so with this interview VREME 
is giving readers an opportunity to acquaint themselves with 
Djukic's ideas. The conversation naturally began with a question 
about the content of the proposal itself. 
  [Djukic] This is an idea that I think deserves serious 
consideration. One of the key issues in the context of 
hyperinflation is how to treat the question of the immense 
redistribution of income that occurs in the national economy. 
This idea is not new. The same dilemma has forced itself upon 
other countries that have gone through hyperinflation, for 
instance, in Germany in 1923, although hyperinflation there was 
less destructive, because their maximum rise of prices was 20.9 
percent per month. 
  First, it is normal that under the conditions of mixed 
ownership there should be a much greater intermingling of the 
interests of socialized firms, which, being debtors, want there 
to be as large a volume of outstanding credit as possible, 
while, on the other hand, as depositors they naturally want 
their deposits to preserve their real value to at least some 
extent. Look what happened at the level of the entire banking 
system and within the individual commercial banks. At the 
general level, it is obvious that dinar capital is melting away: 
In January of last year, the share of dinar lending in total 
bank lendings was 45.28 percent--while at the end of that year 
it had fallen to 7.56 percent. That dinar subbalance was the 
basis for redistribution between debtors and creditors, but that 
is only a minor portion of the total redistribution. This means 
that small and medium-sized dinar savers have lost that property 
once and for all, that is, that they have been additionally 
impoverished, and it implies that the group of main users of 
credit--especially those in a position to quickly obtain 
information about primary note issue -- were in a situation to 
quickly take advantage of the effects of those loans, were in a 
position to realize immense gains as debtors. In the third 
quarter of last year, which was not horribly hyperinflationary, 
the user of credit from primary note issue returned 1.4 percent 
of the funds borrowed. Those figures give you an idea of what 
happened in the last three months of last year, that is, you can 
conclude that every loan was in practice a gift. 
  [Jelicic] Are you actually proposing some kind of 
compensation because of the government's erroneous policy in 
view of the fact that the principal users of credit from primary 
note issue were precisely those business entities which the 
government, both Serbian and federal, was supporting? 
  [Djukic] The essence of it is this: The discount rate of the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia and the rate of interest on the 
money market were far below real interest rates. The essential 
thing is not who was the greatest beneficiary at that moment; 
the essential thing is that the melting away of capital in the 
banks occurred because of hyperinflation and the administrative 
prescription of interest rates. Those circumstances pushed some 
banks into heavy losses, while others were purchasing foreign 
exchange through their enterprises and thus preserving the value 
of their capital--precisely that portion which need not be on 
the balance sheet in our country, but in some foreign account. 
  If you look at this from the standpoint of the state, then 
you see two general negative lines: The first is the extensive 
melting away of bank capital, and the second is the unfair 
approach to individual banks by the very fact that the customers 
of those banks were given differing treatment by the state. 
Thus, a redistribution of power among stockholders occurred 
within the commercial banks. 
  [Jelicic] In what direction should the adjustment of 
hyperinflationary profit go if the "good" banks were the ones 
that sheltered dinars in foreign exchange and thereby preserved 
the property of their customers, and the "bad" ones were those 
which to the end extended credits to the economy and thus left 
their stockholders with worthless stock? 
  [Djukic] There are both coercive and voluntary mechanisms 
for 
that. For instance, insisting on the quota would mean 
concentration and merger of the banks. That is what they are 
doing in Slovenia, and it is possible for the state to 
consistently defend all the criteria prescribed for the business 
operation of the banks. That brings us back to an issue we 
cannot get away from, and that is the conditions under which the 
banks operated last year: Those which bought foreign exchange 
with the credits from primary note issue will easily meet the 
minimum of $1.5 million, but the banks which did not do so are 
now in a position of either merging with some other bank or 
looking for new payments into the bank's capital from the old 
founders or from new ones. It is clear that the old founders 
might well ask whether they should do this again, although they 
have probably offset the loss to their subscribed capital 
through the use of inexpensive credits from primary note issue. 
However, the word is that it cannot be left at that if we want 
clean balance sheets, that is, if we want restructuring of the 
banks. 
  [Jelicic] Are you thinking also of the public, and not just 
of the business community, in connection with the professional 
assessments that this state has "relieved" the public and the 
economy of about $2.5 billion through last year's hyperinflation? 
  [Djukic] I am speaking about all the users of credit and 
investors, but I do not know how that sum was calculated, 
although it confirms my thesis of the immense redistribution in 
our country. I repeat, everything is getting more and more 
complicated in our country because of the multiple forms of 
ownership, so that it is not possible to discover all the flows 
of primitive accumulation of capital, as I call it. It is 
impossible, and it would be unnecessary, to attempt to calculate 
all the hyperinflationary losses and gains, so that I advocate 
only a partial compensation of the greatest changes. 
  [Jelicic] How much would that "partial" be? 
  [Djukic] It would be logical, as far as the banks are 
concerned, for the users of credit to have to bring bank funds 
at least up to where they were before hyperinflation. That would 
at least offset the changes within the bank.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Decision of the Federal Government"] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade -- In its meeting yesterday the Federal 
Government adopted a decision to sell 50 million dinars worth of 
federal commodity reserves in May and June. That sum is to be 
used to cover the federal budget deficit during this period. 
This move was not possible earlier, since the necessary legal 
basis was created only in the last session of the Assembly, Dr. 
Radoje Kontic, federal prime minister, informed newsmen. 
  The deficit in the federal treasury has remained unchanged, 
but in practice this means that foreign-exchange reserves will 
be used to cover 335 million dinars of the federal state's 
deficit and the sale of some commodity reserves, another 180 
million dinars. 
  It was explained to newsmen that 23 million dinars will be 
realized from the sale of farm products, about 5 million from 
energy products, and 17 million from the sale of industrial raw 
materials.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Opposition parties in 
the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia -- the Democratic Party and the 
Democratic Party of Serbia -- on Wednesday welcomed the signing 
of the agreement on a one-month ceasefire in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, but underscored that this should 
be just the first step towards a lasting truce. 
  Assessing that even a brief truce was better than a 
continuation of the conflicts and that the Bosnian Serb 
delegation has once again shown, by accepting the agreement, 
that it wants the war to end, the Democratic Party pointed out 
that the best solution would be the acceptance of the Bosnian 
Serb delegation's proposal on a permanent ceasefire. By 
insisting on a one-month ceasefire, the Moslem side has shown 
that it is not interested in a serious negotiating process, 
because it is clear to everyone that a peace accord cannot be 
reached in such a short time, the Democratic Party said in its 
statement which was sent to TANJUG. 
  According to the ceasefire agreement which was signed on 
wednesday by special United Nations envoy for former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi and Vice-Presidents Ejup Ganic of the 
Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nikola 
Koljevic of the Bosnian Serb Republic, the warring sides have 
pledged to refrain from all military activities for one month as 
of 12:00 hrs local time on June 10. 
  Akashi had proposed a four-month ceasefire agreement, the 
Bosnian Serb delegation had been for a lasting ceasefire, but 
the Moslem- Croat side had insisted that the maximum period be 
four weeks. 
  In a statement sent to TANJUG, tha Democratic Party of 
Serbia 
assessed that the signing of the Geneva agreement was still far 
from lasting peace, but that it should nevertheless be applauded 
as the fwrst step towards an end to the human suffering. From 
the diplomatic aspect, it is good that the Bosnian Serb 
delegation, despite the evident concessions to the Moslems who 
have always so far undermined the peace process, has once again 
shown flexibility and signed the document which can lead to a 
lasting ceasefire and a demarcation process, the Democratic 
Party of Serbia said. The Democratic Party of Serbia has 
understanding for the Serb side's dissatisfaction in Geneva, but 
diplomatic patience is necessary at this time which will be 
certain to bring lasting peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
statement said. 
  The Democratic Party, underscoring that the Bosnian Serb 
delegation has shown once again by accepting even such a short 
ceasefire that it is taking the peace talks seriously and that 
it wants the war to end. The Democratic Party pointed out that 
it is therefore all the more surprising that Yugoslav President 
Zoran Lilic should have said that the Bosnian Serb leaders were 
not constructive, thus weakening their negotiating position at 
the time when the agreement was being signed. The Democratic 
Party of Serbia also criticized Lilic for this in a statement 
released earlier today. Lilic on Tuesday said that Yugoslav 
citizens cannot be hostages of any one leader or part of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or the Bosnian Serb Republic, or 
the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia.

<F P=106> [Report by B. Cani: "Defection or Theft of `Brains'?"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Belgrade -- "The emigration of experts from our 
country has assumed worrying proportions recently. We would 
like to establish the exact number of those who have left the 
country, try to reduce this number, and create the conditions 
for their return." This was stated yesterday by Ratko Uzunovic, 
assistant republican minister for science, technology, and 
development at the consultations devoted to this problem at the 
Institute for International Politics and Economy. 
  According to the information collected by this institute, 
1,060 scientists have left the country in the last 15 years. 
However, as Dr. Vladimir Grecic said, this figure is not 
definite. There are many institutions and organizations that 
have not filled out the questionnaires that were sent to them. 
It is estimated that some 1,400 experts have left the country. 
These experts were mainly at the age considered to be best for 
creativity; 251 of them hold PhD's, 215 hold masters degree, and 
another 594 hold various degrees. The greatest number of those 
who have left are experts for electronics, physics, mathematics, 
chemistry, and medicine. [passage omitted] 
  The largest number of experts has gone to the United States 
(277), followed by Canada (194), Australia (82), Switzerland, 
Austria.... As stated yesterday, particularly worrying are the 
indications that some countries will increase the number of 
entry visas for experts in certain fields. According to the 
representative of the republican Ministry for Education, this 
represents additional (deliberate) form of sanctions against 
Serbia and Yugoslavia. It should be mentioned that Canada, for 
instance, has announced that it would grant around 10,000 
immigration visas this year.

  [Excerpt] The supply of gasoline will improve, but the 
prices of derivatives will not decrease for the time being, said 
Zivko Soklovacki, director of the Public Liaison Office of the 
Serbian Oil Industry [Naftna Industrija Srbije -- NIS]. Vesna 
Tenjovic reports. 
  [Begin recording] Owing to great pressure, it is diesel that 
is mostly produced at the moment. The production is progressing 
according to plan and it should remain at last year's level. 
Rationalization within the oil industry has led to a decrease in 
expenses, which has created conditions for a 4.5 percent 
decrease in prices. However, owing to problems that arose in 
the earlier period, NIS believes that the price of derivatives 
should not be decreased immediately, but rather after the 
company has been consolidated. A decrease in taxes would also 
create leeway for decreasing prices. NIS is also preparing a 
program of rationalization and reorganization of the company, 
but the changes probably will not be great. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Dragan Djuric: "False Hopes"] </F>
  [Text] They have already begun to beat the band about the 
success of the second phase of the Avramovic 
program--invigoration of production. The key argument used is 
the figure of no less than a 21.3-percent increase in Yugoslav 
output between February and March. 
  In Montenegro, however, the "first successful results" are 
proving to be a pure illusion. That is, whereas in Serbia the 
March level of output really was 22.6 percent higher than in 
February, the Montenegrin economy is continuing to record a drop 
of about 6.5 percent. 
  The program for the country's monetary reform and economic 
recovery, recalls Miodrag Causevic, vice president of the 
Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce, was commissioned as a project 
by the Serbian Government and the president of the Republic of 
Serbia, and only later, on grounds that it was the best of all 
the stabilization programs that have been requested, was it 
submitted to the federal government and almost thrust upon it. 
Even Prime Minister Kontic did not immediately accept it with 
open arms, while the Montenegrin Government, Causevic recalls, 
made a number of objections, suggestions, and warnings. On the 
so-called team of some 40 experts headed by Dr. Avramovic, there 
was only one man from Montenegro--Dr. Janko Radulovic, secretary 
of the republic Secretariat for Development. The objections of 
the Government of Montenegro pertained above all to the need to 
respect specific structural needs and interests of the 
Montenegrin economy, which had no place in the Avramovic 
program. In that connection, they particularly accentuated the 
problems of the maritime industry and tourism. 
  "The main reasons why the Montenegrin economy has not felt 
more essentially the favorable aspects of the functioning of the 
Avramovic program up to this point," Causevic says, "lie in its 
more pronounced dependence on exports and the dominant role of 
the heavy industrial sectors." 
  The best example of the impotence of any measures of an 
internal nature is offered by the situation in maritime 
shipping. In the best of times, this industry brought Montenegro 
about one-fifth of its total inflow of foreign exchange. Its 
importance to this republic can also be seen from the fact that 
if Montenegro were viewed as an independent state, it would be 
the strongest maritime power in the world if the size of its 
maritime fleet were compared to the size of the country! Today, 
its fleet of 38 vessels, with a total capacity of almost 1 
million metric tons, is tied up and captive, with immense daily 
costs, which are becoming more and more difficult to cover. 
  Radomir Mugosa, secretary of the general association of the 
maritime industry in the Montenegrin Chamber of Commerce, points 
out that two companies--Jugooceania of Kotor and Prekookeanska 
plovidba of Bar--although before adoption of Resolution No. 820 
they were registered under a foreign flag, were literally caught 
in the mousetrap of the sanctions. Not a single vessel is 
sailing, some have been anchored by the banks as a guarantee for 
collection of debts, others are tied up at the dock under the 
pressure of the sanctions, while almost half of the fleet "hid" 
in China, which it dares not leave. 
  Last year, these companies had to sell four vessels in order 
to cover current costs. At the same time, the empty docks in the 
port of Bar, with a capacity for handling almost five million 
tons of cargo a year, and the shipyards in Bijela, which can 
repair about 100 vessels a year, are gloomy. One part of the 
port has been taken over by the fleet of the Yugoslav Navy, and 
the launches with which the Italians are carrying on a smuggling 
operation (mainly tobacco) with Montenegro are repaired from 
time to time in the shipyard. And that is all. 
  There is no chance at all, Mugosa explains, for this branch 
of the economy, which has immense importance to Montenegro, to 
get on its feet unless the sanctions are removed. 
  The electric power industry, which has a share of 22 percent 
in total Montenegrin output, coal production, which accounts for 
15 percent of output, and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, 
that is, the Niksic Steel Mill and the Podgorica Aluminum 
Combine, whose share is greater than 20 percent, are also 
suffering great troubles. In the Montenegrin Chamber of 
Commerce, they point out that the Avramovic program helps these 
industries only indirectly and that some growth of production 
might be expected only if small alternative production programs 
are started, using unsuccessful capacity that already exists. 
  The Podgorica Aluminum Combine, for example, has managed to 
maintain production at about 40 percent of capacity, while at 
the heart of the combine, the electrolysis operation is 
operating at only one-fifth of capacity. The value of the 
aluminum produced and held in inventory is estimated at about 
$100 million. The need for alkalies, resins, and petroleum coke 
(all imported) is so great that it is almost impossible to 
obtain them through the usual smuggling channels. What is more, 
there is also some doubt about obtaining alumina from Zvornik 
the because of exceptional increase in shipping costs since 
adoption of the new dinar. If we include in this survey Obod of 
Cetinje, which is operating at about 15 percent of capacity and 
importing all of 70 percent of components for production, then 
we get a clearer idea of what it means to say "dependence of the 
economy on imports," and therefore the significance of isolation. 
  Increasingly frequent charges are also coming from the 
largest Montenegrin firm to the effect that instead of 
cooperation in carrying out programs for economic recovery, they 
are encountering disloyal competition on the part of firms in 
Serbia. For instance, at the Niksic Steel Mill they say that 
firms from Serbia are importing more and more steel on the basis 
of various compensation deals, although the Niksic collective 
has on inventory more than 13,000 tons of various types of 
quality steels. At the same time, scrap iron is being exported 
from Serbia more and more, although Niksic is shutting down more 
and more frequently and for longer and longer periods of time. 
  Anton Kastrati, director of the salt plant at Ulcinj, 
explicitly accuses Serbia of importing 50,000 tons of salt in 
violation of a contract and thus jeopardizing this year's salt 
production. And the warehouses are full. 
  At Jugopetrol in Kotor they also have objections. It is 
extremely difficult to obtain fuel abroad, and it is not 
uncommon for it to cost sixfold more than it would have 
otherwise. Customs duties are added to that, so that intolerably 
high fuel costs are being imposed on the economy. It is as 
though Yugoslav sources of petroleum do not exist for 
Montenegro. Recently, none other than Prime Minister Milo 
Djukanovic said that Montenegro was not getting even a drop from 
domestic production. 
  All in all, the Montenegrin economy is on its knees. For 
years now, its production has been dropping faster and faster 
and farther and farther. If the 1992 level of output is taken as 
the basis of comparison, then what was achieved in the 
relatively peaceful year of prewar 1989 would stand at 76, and 
last year's results at minus 60. The level of output at the 
moment, compared to March of last year, which was disastrous, is 
down about 20 percent. To be sure, the statistics show that some 
industries with a total share of less than some 10 percent in 
output have nevertheless come to life. 
  In spite of Avramovic's optimism, the Montenegrins are 
worried about how to keep production from dying altogether.

  [Text] Pristina, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Kosovo District leader 
Milos Simovic, and provincial information secretary Bosko 
Drobnjak had talks in Pristina today with Jonathan Moore, head 
of the State Department desk for Serbia and Montenegro, about 
the political situation in the province, the position of 
national minorities, and the possibilities for restoring 
dialogue. 
  According to a public statement, Simovic said that the 
political and security situation in the province is better this 
year because more ethnic Albanian citizens have been meeting 
their obligations toward the state. This was clearly influenced 
by official statements by a number of diplomats and 
representatives of the European states who, while visiting 
Kosovo and Metohija, presented their governments' clear stand 
regarding the inviolability of the borders of the Republic of 
Serbia and Yugoslavia. 
  According to the statement, Jonathan Moore stated that his 
country is abiding by the stance which rules out the possibility 
of secession by any one part of the Republic of Serbia and 
Yugoslavia. Milos Simovic stated that even though it has not 
been officially registered as a party with the relevant 
republican ministry, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo has not 
experienced any obstacles nor pressures in freely performing its 
activities, despite the fact that it has been at the forefront 
of the anti-Serbian campaign. 
  The talks were also attended by Matthew Palmer, a 
representative of the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade.

  [Text] [Announcer] The Serbian regime continues to 
concoct new trumped-up trials against Albanians. Meanwhile, the 
pursuit of Kosovar youths with the aim of forcefully sending 
them to the army of the Serbian aggressor do not cease. Mehmet 
Haziri reports from Prishtina: 
  [Haziri] The Serbs installed in the Prishtina District Court 
filed a suit against a group of Albanians who had allegedly 
received out special training in Albania during 1992-93. 
According to the articles published today by the Serbian 
newspapers JEDINSTVO and BORBA, this group is made up of Femil 
Estrani, Shkelzen Bajrami, Nexhmedin Sabriu, Lul Heti, Beqir 
Muleti, Hysni Oranca, and Bajram Galapeni, inhabitants of the 
communes of Gllogovc, Shtime, Istog, Ferizaj, and Lipjan. They 
are accused of having allegedly prepared, in collaboration with 
several other persons, the violent secession of Kosova [Kosovo] 
and other areas in former Yugoslavia that are inhabited by 
Albanians in order to form an independent state or to annex it 
to Albania. 
  The indictment also stresses that this group of Albanians, 
on 
the initiative, as it is claimed, of the illegal government of 
the Republic of Kosova and even of its prime minister, Dr. Bujar 
Bukoshi, had allegedly taken part in a special intelligence and 
military training in Lac and Labinot near Elbasan. 
  The fabrications by the Serb Investigation Office and Court 
also stress that wearing the uniform of the Albanian Army, these 
youths from Kosova, after taking the oath, had allegedly been 
trained to use all kinds of arms and explosives, as well as to 
utilize all the military skills to carry out, as asserted, 
diversionist and terroristic acts. 
  The Serbian mass media state that all the members of this 
group had nick-names and acted in full conspiracy. The 
trumped-up trials of Albanians on charges of having received 
military training in Albania have recently been held in Gjilan, 
Peje, and in several other centers of the republic of Kosova.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, president of the Democratic </F>
Community of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Zuzana Serences; place and 
date not given: "Agoston Discusses Vojvodina Autonomy"] 
  [Text] Visions of the "Bosnian syndrome" in Vojvodina are 
not new. At one time Mr. Nenad Canak said that there was a 
danger of the conflict being carried over into Vojvodina if the 
DZVM [Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians] persisted 
and continued to seek realization of the concept of three-tier 
autonomy for Vojvodina Hungarians. This is now being repeated by 
the president of the Reform Democratic Party of Vojvodina 
[RDSV], says the leader of the DZVM, Andras Agoston, in 
commenting on objections to their concept of Hungarian autonomy, 
which contend that this represents an extreme danger to the 
stability of this region and could result in a conflict such as 
we have in Bosnia, as Dr Dragoslav Petrovic warned recently in 
BORBA. Agoston responds to his "critics": 
  "The essence of the mistake both of them make is that the 
`Bosnian syndrome' in fact requires that both sides be armed. 
The Hungarians in Vojvodina are not armed. Accordingly, there 
can be no conflict, but only atrocities, that is, violence 
against one collectivity, difficult situations caused by an 
irresponsible approach of paramilitary units, or certain other 
forces. There can be no question here of the kind of conflicts 
that are involved in Bosnia and certain other parts of the 
former Yugoslavia. We think that the concept we are examining is 
a model acceptable to Europe which makes it possible to achieve 
equality of parts of nationalities in a particular region. We 
are prepared to fight for that, but in a political struggle and 
in a contest of arguments." 
  [Serences] What do you say in response to the assessments of 
the RDSV president that the DZVM is actually "serving" the SPS 
[Socialist Party of Serbia] with its neutral position on certain 
essential issues, thereby weakening the opposition movement, 
waiting for revenge? 
  [Agoston] We have always said, and it has been borne out 
several times, that the opposition is not united and that one 
cannot speak of it as a coherent force. Aside from that, the 
DZVM has been presenting its demands to the Parliament and 
Government of Serbia, seeking three-tier autonomy, and it must 
be borne in mind that achievement of that concept is not 
possible with the consent of just one party. What is essential 
to us -- that is the essence of this democratic demand -- is the 
support of forces in Parliament, since only in that way can we 
expect the concept to be realized in practice, can we expect a 
development in international relations, which will help to make 
it clear to all the leading political forces in the country that 
the DZVM concept is actually democratic and pulls all of us out 
of this crisis. It is with that in mind that we have always 
addressed Parliament, the government, and the presidents of the 
state, aware that only a certain kind of political consensus can 
bring us results. Incidentally, with respect to the democratic 
fight to change the entire system, we will always participate on 
the side of those who strive for that, consistent with our 
political strength. However, we nevertheless think that only the 
Serbs can adopt democracy for Serbia and Serbs, that is, those 
large political parties which have sufficient prestige and 
political legitimacy within that nationality. 
  [Serences] With respect to the DZVM, what is the situation 
inside the organization? On the eve of the recent election 
conference in Senta, there was a danger that the DZVM would 
split. 
  [Agoston] The most important thing is that in Senta we 
arrived at a democratic decision to support the democratic 
course pursued up to now by the DZVM, the essence of which is to 
constantly repeat demands for autonomy and at the same time the 
desire to enter into dialogue with the bodies of government and 
political forces which can take us to that goal. We received 
more than two-thirds of the vote, and this political movement 
has absolute legitimacy. In addition, and this is at least as 
important, we managed to get free of problems of a financial 
nature and to defend ourselves against an attempt to exert 
political influence on the DZVM from outside, meeting the 
challenge when financial resources were offered. 
  [Serences] Your recent statement in Budapest, in which you 
allowed the possibility that perhaps that autonomy might not be 
achieved and that could then be grounds for a fairly large-scale 
expulsion of the Hungarians here, evoked considerable response. 
  [Agoston] Our fundamental belief is that autonomy will come, 
since this is the only realistic solution based on principle. We 
also can see this from positions taken by the highest 
representatives in the U.S. Administration. But we are realists, 
we can also imagine a situation in which recognition of the 
autonomy of Hungarians simply does not happen. Since we consider 
autonomy the legal framework for preserving the ethnic identity 
of Vojvodina Hungarians, we think -- if that should not occur -- 
that probably a large number of Hungarians would think that 
there is no point in staying here. Of course there always is 
that worst-case scenario, the disastrous one: a general 
conflict, if war flared up even in these parts, and there would 
be atrocities against Hungarians in Vojvodina. We cannot 
preclude that possibility, but we are not reckoning on those 
dangers, we don't think them realistic, and we are aiming our 
political struggle towards democratic achievement of our 
objective. 
  [Serences] Was the recent answer from Mr. Lilic, president 
of 
the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], to your written 
request for the DZVM to be included in preparation of the new 
law on minorities the first time any letter of yours received an 
answer from the top level of government? 
  [Agoston] Yes, the first time. 
  [Serences] And did Mr. Lilic's response result in the actual 
inclusion of the DZVM in preparation of the law? 
  [Agoston] We were not included in the proceedings. But that 
does not worry us too much, since the international factor is 
not looking to see whether such a law exists or not, but is 
looking specifically at the situation and listening to the 
legitimate representatives of the minorities. We think that no 
one can evade us on this issue since we are legitimate 
representatives of the Hungarians in Vojvodina, nor can any law 
be adopted without involving us essentially, and that means 
politically, in its adoption. We are continuing to seek dialogue 
with the authorities in Serbia and in Yugoslavia, and we believe 
that only on that basis will there be solutions satisfactory to 
both sides. 
  [Serences] We hear rumors that you are preparing to leave 
the 
country with your family? 
  [Agoston] Such rumors have not reached me, but, no matter, 
my 
answer is this: I am staying, and I believe that we will get our 
autonomy in the foreseeable future and that all these political 
conflicts will die down, and that we will live beside one 
another peacefully, and, I hope, contentedly.

  [Text] The Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] Foreign Ministry reports that Foreign 
Minister Crvenkovski met with the U.S. special envoy in the 
Greek-Macedonia dispute, Matthew Nimetz, in Ohrid yesterday. 
Today, Nimetz is to be received by President Gligorov. This 
was the official announcement on the Crvenkovski-Nemitz meeting, 
with no details on the contents of the talks, which gave space 
to various media speculations. One such supposition even claims 
that Greek diplomats also arrived in Ohrid, along with Nimetz, 
and took part in the talks. The Greek prime minister bitterly 
refuted this. The A1 Television finds out from sources close to 
Papandreou's cabinet that Nimetz will probably not go back to 
Athens, as the Greek government wishes not to heat up the 
atmosphere four days before the elections for the European 
Parliament. Unofficial sources also point out that even if 
Nimetz does go back to Athens, there will be no one to receive 
him. Papandreou did not receive Nimetz even last Monday, and 
Papoulias left for Iran yesterday, and will afterward attend a 
NATO ministers' conference in Istanbul. 
  Officially, the Greek government spokesman Evangelos 
Venzelos 
categorically denied all scenarios on new proposals by Nimetz, 
pointing out that such speculations are harmful, rather than 
useful for his country. He also underlined that the Macedonian 
question would not be brought up at the coming EU prime 
ministers' summit in Corfu. 
  Meanwhile, the media in Athens report on the talks in 
Athens, 
making no comments, and with a general conclusion that the 
progress at the talks now depends entirely on Skopje. Thus, TA 
NEA claims that Nimetz's aim was to put pressure on the 
Macedonian leadership, while the Greek Foreign Ministry is 
somewhat optimistic as to a way out of the dead end. 
  President Gligorov is of the opinion that there will be no 
essential progress in the negotiations, despite latest 
continuation in indirect talks under Nimetz's mediation, THE 
DAILY TELEGRAPH wrote yesterday. MAKFAX reports that the 
British paper concludes that the Greek embargo has considerably 
damaged the Macedonian economy, already at losses as a result of 
the sanctions against the Federal Yugoslavia. THE DAILY 
TELEGRAPH points out the economic crisis is an additional source 
of instability and could lead to a war, which would include 
Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, and Albania, with Turkey as a patron 
of Tirana and the Turkish minority.

  [Excerpt] Skopje, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- In Skopje today, 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
President Kiro Gligorov today received Matthew Nimetz, the 
special U.S. envoy in the Greek-Macedonian dispute. Their talks 
lasted for more than two hours. Nimetz arrived on a two-day 
working visit to the FYROM yesterday ahead of the resumption of 
negotiations between Skopje and Athens in New York on 13 June. 
  In a press statement following his talks with Gligorov, 
which 
were also attended by Macedonian Foreign Relations Minister 
Stevo Crvenkovski, Nimetz said that he spoke about the topics of 
great importance for regional developments. According to 
Nimetz, it is inappropriate to give any forecasts as regards the 
outcome of future negotiations. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Mladen Stancic] </F>
  [Text] Skopje, June 9 (TANJUG) -- Businessmen in The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are paying an 
increasingly high price because of the "southern traffic 
pocket", created by the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on 
Yugoslavia and Greece's trade blockade of the FYROM. The 
transport of goods, raw materials and semi-manufactures via the 
roundabout east-west corridor has resulted in a drastic rise of 
business costs and, according to FYROM businessmen, will require 
an additional 40 million U.S. dollars by the end of the year. 
As a result, an increasing number of companies are facing 
bankruptcy, while others have been forced to halt production. 
The ban on transit through Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) was 
introduced in April 1993, when the U.N. sanctions imposed in 
late May 1992, were tightened. 
  The Greek authorities closed their border and imposed a 
trade 
embargo on the FYROM last January after some E.U. countries 
recognized it as an independent state. Athens strongly opposes 
the FYROM being recognized under the name of Macedonia, 
explaining that this name is closely linked with the Greek 
history and that it indicates FYROM's territorial claims. The 
anti-Yugoslav blockade has so far cost the FYROM three billion 
U.S. dollars. 
  Two million U.S. dollars have been earmarked for the "south 
wing" of the so-called customs corridor, i.e. for the widening 
of two bottlenecks at the border crossings Deve Bair (to 
Bulgaria) and Chafa San (to Albania). That, however, has only 
dimmed the essence of the problem. 
  Shipping agents in the FYROM are aware that the corridor 
through Bulgaria and in particular the one through Albania 
cannot be compared to the routes towards Europe via Serbia. 
  Although the distance between the border crossing Chafa San 
and the Albanian port of Durres is only 148 km, trailer trucks 
need over nine hours to cover that section because it is in a 
very bad condition. Moreover, they are in constant fear from 
road bandits or police "controls." The port of Durres, which 
gained in popularity after the Thessaloniki port was shut down 
to goods from the FYROM last February, is unable to meet all 
requirements. 
  While transport charges in the world amount for 5-12 per 
cent 
in produce costs, the transport of FYROM goods to Europe via 
Albania and Bulgaria hikes up these costs to as much as 50 per 
cent.

  [Text] "The state police is against democracy in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and is 
using all means possible to stay in power, which is a severe 
blow to basic human rights as this involves methods of 
manipulation with the public and police intervention in the 
spheres of inalienable civil rights." Peter Gosev, leader of 
the Democratic Party said at yesterday's press conference. 
  As arguments for this, Gosev stated frequent and 
long-lasting 
blocking of the work of parliament, not by the opposition, but 
by the ruling party, which refuses to attend sessions or limits 
debates on "inconvenient" subjects. He also spoke of increased 
influence of political parties over the institutions of 
democracy, through unscrupulous party interfering into judicial 
matters, covering up for criminal charges against high state 
officials, and not starting bankruptcy proceedings in certain 
firms. 
  "The highest police officials are leading a politics of 
destroying the opposition." Gosev said. In order to do this, 
according to Gosev, they are increasingly using satellite 
parties and individuals known to have been informants for former 
intelligence services. He also said the interior minister was 
turning into a Stalin-type policeman.

  [Text] The President of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov yesterday received 
the leadership of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity]; 
the President Ljupco Georgievski, the Secretary General Boris 
Zmejkovski, and the Vice-President Dosta Dimovska, at their own 
request. They explained that they wanted to inform him about 
the attitude of the State Security Service toward the 
opposition, and to hand him document proof of that. Namely, 
according to their assertions, they have evidence of wiretapping 
and an operative action of the Service for State Security 
involving several VMRO-DPMNE deputies. 
  According to the announcement from President Gligorov's 
cabinet, at the beginning he emphasized that in accordance with 
his constitutional and legal competence and authorization, he 
had no jurisdiction to directly investigate the accusations of 
involvement of the State Security in the internal-party 
relations. In compliance with the clear constitutional and 
legal authorizations, Gligorov expressed full conviction that 
questions of this type should be raised and settled within the 
framework of the determined legal procedure. 
  In that sense, President Gligorov underlined that the only 
competent place, according to the Constitution, which should 
deal with any kind of realizations or suspicion regarding the 
attitude of the State Security Service toward VMRO-DPMNE is the 
Commissions of the Macedonian Parliament for control of the work 
of the Security Service. Also, a procedure should be initiated 
before the competent organs -- the public prosecutor sand the 
appropriate Court, in relation to any kind of document 
concerning that. That is the only way to avoid any kind of 
speculations or mystifications regarding such serious 
accusations. Also, that is the only way to maintain the 
principles of democracy, the respect of the laws and the 
functioning of the government authority in the Republic. 
  President Gligorov added that the building of a democratic 
atmosphere and the respect of the laws, as a lasting political 
orientation, had a special important in the present pre-election 
period in the Republic. That will contribute to the 
strengthening of the feeling that the basic national interest 
are respected, both in the country and abroad, and that the 
integrity of our country will be protected, both from internal 
conflicts and outside aspirations. The VMRO-DPMNE leadership 
agreed with the President on these points.

  [Text] [Announcer] Esteemed listeners, at this moment we

vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, on the 
line. Mr Ganic, please inform our listeners about [words

  [Ganic] The negotiations yesterday lasted late into the 
night. (?This morning they) resumed at 1100 and at this moment 
-- it is approximately 1500 -- we are still here in the UN 
building. (?The UN) team, which is lead by Yasushi Akashi, came 
out with (?an entirely new) proposal by which [words 
indistinct]. This is a sort of proposal that envisages [words 
indistinct] sides. This is first. Second, it [words 
indistinct] a plan to gather heavy arms and naturally a more 
permanent cease-fire that would be a result of perhaps wider 
talks and elaboration of the details that (?are accompanying) 
the negotiations, which assumes [words indistinct] exchange of 
prisoners and exchange of information about missing persons. 
The UN Protection Force agrees to further supervise and monitor 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, in brief this 
is a UN proposal (?aimed at) halting military operations for the 
period of one month, with the commencement of [word indistinct] 
time. 
  We informed Mr. Akashi that as concerns us such a proposal 
is 
acceptable on the condition that it will not slow down the peace 
process. As regards our side, that is, the state delegation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mr. Akashi is satisfied with our stance, 
that is to say, [words indistinct] UN are satisfied with our 
stance [words indistinct] (?formulated by UN). Therefore, this 
involves [words indistinct] a month.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (AFP) -- Following is the full text 
of the proposal drafted by UN special envoy to the former 
Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and signed at talks here on Wednesday 
by both sides to the Bosnian conflict, the Bosnian Serbs and the 
Moslem-Croat federation. 
  1. As a first step towards a comprehensive cessation of 
hostilities throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina, both sides in the 
conflict agree not to engage in any offensive military 
operations or other provocative actions of any kind for a period 
of one month starting from June 10, 1994 at 1200 hours local 
time. 
  2. This period of military stabilization is required in 
order to give time for reflection leading to a resumption, 
within the next several days, under UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Forces] auspices, of negotiations on a comprehensive 
cessation of hostilities. Meanwhile, the immediate and complete 
release of all persons including prisoners of war, and of all 
information already available on persons whose whereabouts are 
unknown, as soon as possible under the supervision and in 
accordance with the plan of action of the ICRC, will be 
implemented. 
  3. UNPROFOR will continue to monitor and report all military 
activity along the present line of conflict. 
  Signing the agreement for the Serbs was Vice President 
Nikola 
Koljevic. For the Moslems it was Vice President Ejup Ganic and 
for the Croats Mile Akmadzic. Akashi also signed the accord.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (TANJUG) -- U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali described as relative success the accord on 
the one-month cessation of military activities in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina signed in Geneva Wednesday. This document 
came as a compromise which at the last moment saved from fiasco 
the conference which the Moslem-Croatian delegation for the 
first four days boycotted and then blackmailed to the end. 
  According to a U.N. spokesperson in Geneva, Butrus-Ghali set 
out that the accord was only the first step towards achieving 
lasting cessation of hostilities and finding a generally 
acceptable political solution in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Head of the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) delegation Radovan 
Karadzic said prior to the official announcement on signing the 
accord that the Serb side has once again demonstrated its sense 
for reaching compromise, but expressed doubt this would set the 
Moslems on course to peace and understanding.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb Republic 
(R.S.) President Radovan Karadzic said Wednesday that partial 
solutions, such as the signing of ceasefire accord for one 
month, pushed towards war and did not represent a basis for 
peace in Bosnia- herzegovina. He told reporters that the Serb 
side was once again not treated equally. 
  The accord -- signed Wednesday by U.N. special envoy Yasushi 
Akashi and Vice-Presidents of the Moslem-Croatian Federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Ejup Ganic and the Bosnian Serb Republic 
(R.S.) Nikola Kolrevic -- envisage the two sides refrain from 
engaging for a period of one month in any military activity 
beginning June 10 at noon local time. 
  The signed document, as set out in Geneva, in no way 
(?completed a platform) with which, under Akashi's proposal, the 
conference opened and according to which an accord was to have 
been signed for four-month ceasefire period, as the basic 
pre-condition in finding a comprehensive political solution to 
the Bosnia crisis. 
  The Serbs have from the outset of the conference requested a 
lasting ceasefire, while the Moslem Croatian delegation first 
boycotted for four days the talks, under the pretext that armed 
Serbs did not leave the three-kilometer exclusion zone around 
Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia, as set out in the 
U.N. Resolution No.913. When the Moslem observers and U.N. 
members on the spot confirmed that armed Serbs have left the 
said area, Ganic said he would accept only talks on a four-week 
ceasefire. 
  The signed accord, clearly designed to suit the Moslem side, 
was taken in Geneva as the first step towards a comprehensive 
cessation of hostilities, something, as set out, about which the 
warring parties would continue discussions over the next few 
days. All this, of course, on condition the Moslems indeed 
intended ever to join in earnest talks on peace and adhere to 
the signed documents, including this one signed Wednesday in 
Geneva. 
  The accord envisaged the warring sides carry out an exchange 
of prisoners and release all captured persons on their 
respective territories as well as submit to the Red Cross lists 
of missing persons. This process is to be scrupulously 
supervised [word indistinct].

  [Text] Following the conclusion of the Geneva negotiations

following statement for Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and TV: 
  [Begin Ganic recording] The delegation acted in accordance 
with the Assembly guidelines. We fought in a diplomatic way for 
the principles laid down by the Assembly. A few days ago, 
Karadzic's troops withdrew from the 3-km zone around Gorazde -- 
these were soldiers, armed civilians, police, all his army in 
various shapes and forms. Having seen that this condition had 
been met, we began talks and a cease-fire agreement was reached 
which rules out any offensive operations for a one-month period. 
  I must say straight away that huge pressure was exerted on 
our delegation for days to sign a four-month cease-fire, or for 
an even longer period. However, we did not agree to free the 
Serbian side from the obligation to negotiate peace, while on 
the other hand we did not agree to sit and wait for winter. 
Huge pressure was exerted on us. We fought with arguments -- 
we only had foreign journalists on our side. 
  Every day we made public statements and we compared the 
situation: Our citizens know that several days ago Europe 
celebrated D-Day, when the allies landed in Normandy to have a 
showdown with Hitler, a showdown with fascism. I said that 
nowadays we, the unarmed Bosnians, are trying to have a showdown 
with a resurrected fascism. I called on the European public to 
unite as they united then against fascism. We cannot do that 
job unarmed. That virus of ethnic cleansing and genocide, which 
the international community has nurtured in Bosnia by ignoring 
the aggression of Serbian fascism, is now spreading throughout 
the world, causing real chaos. 
  In other words, a parallel was drawn between what happened 
during the Normandy landing and the final showdown with fascism, 
and these negotiations here. Many correspondents were in fact 
on our side, interpreting our stands, so an agreement on a 
four-week cease-fire was finally reached, as we proposed in the 
beginning. 
  A new stage in the negotiations -- a new kind of talks 
directed at reducing the military potential in Bosnia -- will be 
formulated soon. This primarily regards the removal of heavy 
weaponry, in the event the embargo on arms sales to Bosnia's 
Muslims is not lifted, then -- if the world believes that too 
many weapons cause too much war -- the formula less weapons, 
less war, should be applied, which means that the Serbian regime 
and its army should be disarmed. We shall be formulating a new 
[word indistinct] for such talks in a couple of days, and this 
has been agreed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ruzhdi Demiri: "The Darling of Europe </F>
Destabilizes the Balkans"] 
  [Text] As international bodies step up their efforts to 
solve the disputes that have arisen as a result of the bloody 
wars among the Slavic peoples inhabiting the area of what was 
Yugoslavia, and as optimism grows among the United Nations, the 
EU, and NATO for an end to the war in Bosnia, certain Greek 
political circles are becoming increasingly short-tempered. 
Politically, this has been evident in rising political tension 
in the region, an embargo and blockade against Greece's 
neighbors, the toleration of acts of aggression on neighboring 
territory such as the case of Peshkepi near Gjirokaster, and the 
training of Kurdish terrorists for action on Turkish territory. 
The last two represent acts of aggression against sovereign 
states. Most recently, there have also been serious threats of 
a possible Greek-Albanian war from Greek politicians on both the 
governments and the opposition sides, as the Greek politician 
Militiadis Evert said. The question arises of wily, despite the 
Commitment of international bodies (of which Greece herself is a 
member) to ending the war in the Balkans, every move by Greece 
conflicts with this commitment. In fact, Greece has used all 
its resources, through various forms of covert action, to 
exacerbate regional tensions and to create the kind of relations 
that could lead to open war with its own neighbors of Albania, 
Macedonia, and Turkey. 
<H5>  What Makes Greece So Tetchy? </H5>
  Many commentators and analysts have seen the Greek 
Government's decision to suspend dialogue with Albania and to 
cancel the preparatory meeting for the talks between the two 
Greek and Albanian foreign ministers as part of Greek 
cooperation with the official policy of the Serbs, who aim to 
distract attention from their brothers in Bosnia to the south of 
the Balkans: Serbian policies are also, with Greek help, 
destabilizing Macedonia, which is not developing regional 
cooperation to the taste of Athens and Belgrade. Those who make 
such claims may be quite right. 
  However, if one thinks of Greece's position in Western 
institutions such as the MU and NATO and the status and 
economic, political, and diplomatic benefits that flow to Greece 
from membership in these institutions, it is difficulty to 
believe that Greece does not have its own strategic interests, 
not necessarily connected and coordinated with Serbian strategic 
interests. The question arises of why Greece is so tetchy at a 
time when a model for solving the question of Bosnia is being 
formed, and, second, why Greece always expresses this tetchiness 
whenever the issue of Kosova is broached, as now when there is 
so much talk about the start of Albanian-Serbian talks and about 
international bodies opening their files on Kosova? 
  It is interesting to note that after the statements by 
Berisha and Rugova about talks with Belgrade in the presence of 
an international third party, after Berisha's visit to Turkey 
and Bulgaria and his recent meeting with Gligorov, Greece has 
been intensifying its destructive tendencies toward her 
northwestern neighbor. Greek policies and their interests are in 
accordance with the current expansionist policies of Serbia. 
However, the repeated creation of crises with Albania, in 
cyclical form, by the Greek state and Greek political groups of 
all colors leads one to suspect that Greece, in the strategic 
sense, is not always in accordance with the policy of Belgrade. 
The possibility of a start to solving the Kosova question 
represents something still more serious for this anachronistic 
Greek policy, and the possibility of even a formal rapprochement 
between Serbia and the Albanians terrifies both members of the 
government and the opposition in Greece. 
  In Serbia, despite the prevailing chaos, chauvinism, and war 
fever, various statements have been issued here and there 
calling for a revision of Serbian policies toward the Albanians, 
such as the recent statement by Dr. Ratko Markovic, the compiler 
of all Milosevic's constitutions in recent years, who spoke of a 
possible reorientation of Serbia toward the Albanian factor 
through economic cooperation on the Adriatic highway. 
Intellectuals who were standard-bearers of the idea of Greater 
Serbia, from Cosic to Ljubomir Simovic, are also calling for a 
revision of megalomaniac Serbian policies. Simovic has come out 
in favor of "a new, real, and objective definition of 
ourselves," and for a realistic position for the Serbian nation 
in the represent time of general national realignment. 

<H5>    Fear of Solitude </H5>
  There may be full justice on the side of those who think 
that 
Greece is frightened of a major Serbian turnaround after the 
issue of Bosnia is solved, a turnaround that will result in 
Serbia's return to cooperation and a Serbian demand for 
integration on the East-West axis, an axis in which the new 
Italian prime minister Berlusconi explicitly expresses ltaly's 
interest as he received Macedonian Prime Minister Crvenkovski. 
Greece appears to be worried at the possibility of being "left 
by itself." 
  Thus, when the international community discourages Serbia is 
its aggressive policies Greece attempts to embolden Serbian 
aggression again, even more than the interests of the Serbs in 
this direction demand, by tolerating terrorism and enforcing 
blockades and embargoes against her neighbors. This is what the 
Greek Government has done in its anti-Albanian decision to block 
35 million ECU's from the EU, which were earmarked for Albania's 
financial policy. This is what Greece has done in Evert's 
threats of war, and so forth. 
  All these things mark out Greece as the most destabilizing 
factor in the Balkans after Serbian militarism, and a factor 
that could ignite the spark of a war that would be the overture 
to a general Balkan conflagration. The question is how long the 
international community will tolerate Athens' duplicity. In all 
probability, a general opening up of everybody toward everybody 
else in the Balkans will not suit Greek ruling circles for their 
own internal reasons. It is well known that Greece in recent 
decades received largescale economic aid from the West as a 
bulwark against communism in the East. However, the Greek 
ruling families like those of Papandreou, Venezilos, Mitsotakis, 
and Kalderis have still not accounted for how all this aid was 
spent and where it went, when the Greek economy is known not to 
be in terribly good shape even today. 
  If there is any truth in these opinions, Greece, thanks to 
its own government and ruling circles, might be left out in the 
cold, with or without its current ally Serbia, when the Balkans 
are redirected and integrated into the new world order and when 
the exploitation of the East-West axis begins. The second 
variant, more beneficial to the Greek people and state, would 
involve Greece's integration in intra-Balkan cooperation, in an 
area in which no visas would be required and there would be 
unrestricted movement of goods, people, and ideas. However, for 
the almost feudal Greek families who still hold sway, this would 
mean accounting for the profligate expenditure of the 
large-scale Western economic aid and for the political and 
diplomatic errors that resulted in the loss of Cyprus and the 
creation of hatred and tension between the Greek people and 
their neighbors, which could have repercussions for decades to 
come. Greece can no longer threaten the existence of any state 
in the Balkans, thanks to the new balance of power that is in 
greater equilibrium than at any time during the last seven or 
eight decades. On the contrary, it can only weaken its own 
position and hasten the decomposition from within of the Greek 
state, in which Macedonians' Bulgarians, Vlachs, Albanians, and 
trucks have now begun to demand the affirmation of their own 
national characteristics. 
  Neither Macedonia with its flag of Philip of Macedon nor 
Albania, "friend of the United States, Germany Turkey, and 
Italy," pose a danger to the future of the Greek state, but only 
Greek state policy itself, which, as we have seen, is 
detrimental to the citizens of Greece itself, as far as the 
borders with Greece's neighboring states are concerned, and with 
its toleration of the racism of different political groups 
toward neighboring peoples. Albania and the Albanians may for 
the moment be prevented from receiving $30-40 million of 
European aid, but it is the Greek people themselves who will 
eventually pay the price for Greece's feudal government, as they 
paid in Cyprus and elsewhere.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Who Is the American, a Spy Linked </F>
to `Omonia'?"] 
  [Text] By the end of last week, RTSh [Albanian 
Radio-Television] said six "Omonia" [political organization of 
Greek minority population in Albania] activists -- in actual 
fact the official communique said five -- were not charged with 
anticonstitutional offenses, but with espionage activities in 
favor of Athens. Strangely enough, this announcement had its 
roots in the U.S. State Department, whose spokesman turned up 
before the journalists and made known his country's stance 
toward the controversy between Albania and Greece. 
  The strangest thing though was to hear the same spokesman 
declare that a U.S. citizen was enmeshed in these espionage 
activities linked to the Greek intelligence service, and that 
the U.S. Government gave the Albanians a free hand to treat him 
without the slightest hesitation according to their laws. 
  RTSh has been manipulating this event in a disgraceful way, 
trying to show that the United States is so close and friendly 
to us that it cares neither for its old ally -- Greece -- nor 
for its own citizen. This is a shameless bluff. In actual 
fact, there is no U.S. citizen at all embroiled in the 
sensational "Omonia" affair. "The U.S. citizen," victimized by 
Washington, first and foremost is an Albanian citizen who has an 
Albanian passport, because he was born and grew up in this 
country. Second, he has a Greek passport because, by 
nationality, he belongs to the Greek minority in Albania, and 
finally he is a U.S. citizen because, a year ago, he was issued 
a passport of that country, where he has stayed perhaps less 
than a month altogether. This is the man, Mr. Theodhori 
Bezhani, whom the State Department's spokesman said Albania 
could treat according to its law. This the reason why now it 
turns out that there are six and not five "Omonia" arrested 
activists, because Th. Bezhani is alternately counted now as 
Albanian and now as American (in fact he should have been 
counted also as Greek, but it would have boosted the number to 
seven). 
  Now everything is O.K. with us, because even spy networks 
are 
to be discovered for us by the United States, and there is no 
need for any of us to work in this direction....

<F P=106> [Interview with Dashamir Shehi, minister of labor and social </F>
welfare, by A. Manaj in Tirana; date not given: "`Shock Therapy' 
-- Albania's Economic Revival!"] 
  [Text] [Manaj] Mr. Minister, recently Mr. Berlusconi 
announced, in the name of the Italian Government, the creation 
of 1 million new jobs. What would you say about our 
government's plans in terms of employment? 
  [Sheqi] For the year 1994, the government has planned to 
employ around 60,000 people who are at present jobless or 
receiving social assistance. Speaking about planning, we do not 
have in mind the outdated plans of the centralized economy. For 
example, this year 13 billion leks have been earmarked for 
public investments, 4.6 million of which come directly from the 
state budget and the rest is funded by foreign investors and 
international bodies. The aforementioned figure originates from 
the 10-percent economic growth envisaged for this year. It is 
equal to last year's growth, when 60,000 vacancies were filled 
in the private sector alone and public investments accounted for 
only 4 billion leks. 
  Also, the employment structure, which is the most important 
thing, will change this year. Last year, the largest number of 
vacancies was in the private sector and the rest in the 
production sphere. By contrast, quite the opposite is happening 
this year. It highlights the fact that this is the first year 
when, after a long-running break in production, we will witness 
an increase in industrial production, as a result of small- and 
medium-size privatization of state-owned enterprises. 
Meanwhile, as planned, unprofitable enterprises will continue 
to be closed down. 
  [Manaj] What does the new employment structure involve? 
  [Shehi] Highway construction is one of our labor fronts, but 
despite its considerable value, during this construction period 
it will not be the most important. The main stage in creating 
new jobs will begin after completion of the highways with the 
setting up of petrol supply points, motels, hotels, restaurants 
and factories like the brewery and Coca-Cola factory recently 
opened in Tirana, and so on. By and large, there is a new 
climate favoring employment. Our government's plans offer a 
relatively large number of alternatives. 
  [Manaj] What would you say about the 100-percent inflation 
indexation approved at the recent government-BSPSH [Union of 
Independent Syndicates of Albania] meeting? 
  [Shehi] We reached agreement on this problem, and within 
this framework work is under way for setting up a working group 
that will go into the indexation details that will take the form 
of a law or an agreement. As far as our government is 
concerned, it is, in this respect, in favor of an agreement. 
  [Manaj] How do you see prospects for our county's 
northeastern area, regarding economic growth and employment? 
  [Shehi] We see this as being closely linked with the plans 
that various international economic organizations have to 
alleviate the hardship of this poor rural area, whose problems 
are actually aggravated as a result of the secluded political 
aura in which it is shrouded. In this respect, we see the 
improvement of its road network, and the development of its 
timber industry and geology -- as for the latter we can mention 
here our government's recent agreements on the creation of the 
"Albakri" [Albanian copper] joint venture -- as possibilities 
offered to this area for the solution of a number of its 
economic problems. Likewise, on this front, we are continuing 
negotiations on the establishment of the "Albkrom" joint 
venture. As for the BSPSH leader's request to the government to 
pass a law alleviating the impact of electricity price hikes, in 
this region it is not a matter of general measures but of a 
specific one related to the coal branch. By this measure, the 
government returns some kind of support to this branch. 
  [Manaj] What stage has the work of drafting the labor 
legislation reached? 
  [Shehi] We have entered the final stage of working out the 
Labor Code, and we are looking forward to passing it on to 
Parliament for approval before the summer vacations. The labor 
legislation, however, cannot be considered complete, unless 
several groups of legislation, for various reasons, are 
consolidated, and it will take a considerable time to do all 
this, including the contracts in the state budget sector and 
those dealing with the status of state employees. We think that 
Albania will have the basic part of its Labor Code approved by 
the end of 1994, which will be enough to enable us to proceed 
further with this activity.

  [Excerpt] About an hour ago, State Chamber Chairman Herman 
Rigelnik announced the results of a secret vote on the candidate 
for interior minister, Andrej Ster. Out of 76 deputies, 58 
voted in favor of him while 15 were opposed. Before the vote, 
hitherto Interior Minister Ivo Bizjak had addressed the 
deputies. Here is a report by Robert Rakar: 
  [Begin recording] [Rakar] Immediately upon his election, 
the new interior minister, Andrej Ster, in an interview for our 
radio station said that he was very satisfied with the outcome 
of the vote and especially with the number of votes in support. 
Regarding his future work in the ministry he said: 
  [Ster] The tasks are not in short supply. In addition to 
the present ones new tasks will arise daily. The fact is that a 
conflict replacement or replacement that would drag on over a 
longer period of time in uncertainty could very much delay if 
not interrupt some pretty important projects that are currently 
underway in the ministry. I see my role primarily here. I have 
absolutely no illusions about the capabilities that I have. I 
intend to work to the best of my ability and knowledge, together 
with a ministry team that I believe is rather good. [passage

  [Text] At the morning session of the party's political 
coordinating group, Secretary General of the Slovene Christian 
Democrats [SKD] Edvard Stanic offered his resignation. As we 
have learned, the reason for this move was primarily of a party 
nature as it is supposed to accelerate the overcoming of 
internal disputes and consolidate the party's position. 
  At the recent party conference in Zagorje Stanic favored a 
policy of dialogue, patience, and discussion with the political 
adversaries and at the same time warned of the party's actual 
strength in political life. This illustrates the differences 
between two factions, of which one favors the SKD leaving the 
government coalition and the other warning that the party is 
only as strong in the coalition and the government as is its 
number of deputies. The latter faction also emphasizes that it 
is not possible to put forward demands in the government because 
the prime minister's post is in the hands of the coalition 
partner. 
  In a statement for Radio Slovenia SKD, the secretary general 
said that the chances of him changing his mind are very slim. 
He decided to resign after the vote of the party's deputies, 
who, in the parliament last week, did not support the proposal 
of the coalition government to replace Labor Minister Jozica 
Puhar. Such and similar actions are supposed to undermine the 
party's credibility in the negotiations about the formation of a 
two-party government. Because of this, party president Lojze 
Peterle is supposedly also reconsidering his position. 
  The strengthening of the party also lies behind the proposal 
to move the date of the planned party congress forward from 
December to September 1994. As we have learned, the SKD 
leadership will discuss the current situation next week.

  [Excerpt] Here is a brief interview granted by Hrvoje 
Sarinic, head of the Croatian negotiating team, to Croatian 
Television correspondent Silvana Mendjusic: 
  [Begin Mendjusic recording] The latest from Geneva: Serbian 
Krajina President Milan Martic has agreed to negotiations with 
Croatia; the conditions are for the meeting to take place in 
Plitvice on 16 and 17 June. Does the Croatian side accept these 
conditions? 
  [Sarinic] First, I would not completely agree that these are 
conditions in the strictest sense of the word. As you know, the 
Croatian side has always insisted that meetings on the 
normalization of relations between the Republic of Croatia and 
the Serbs from the UNPA [UN Protected Areas] take place on the 
territory of the Republic of Croatia. This was our condition 
and this is probably the reason why no meetings have so far been 
organized -- because of their refusal to accept this until now. 
They have obviously accepted now, and I salute this with 
pleasure. 
  The signing of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities 
was only the first in a series of talks leading to the 
normalization of overall relations between the Republic of 
Croatia and the Serbs from the UNPA. Therefore, we accept this 
with pleasure because we believe that our conditions have been 
fulfilled. 
  [Mendjusic] Could you comment on the reason for Martic's 
sudden consent. Does this mean that the pressure brought to 
bear by the international community has become too much of a 
strain? 
  [Sarinic] I believe that it would be a mistake to view their 
standpoints on their own. You know that the problem of the 
Serbs from the UNPA is linked to the problem in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that the key to all these problems 
should be sought in Belgrade. It is evident that the Serbs have 
come to the conclusion that further procrastination under 
pressure from the international community is not in their 
interest. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] Knin, June 8 (TANJUG) -- President of the republic 
of Serb Krajina (RSK) Milan Martic has agreed that the first 
round of talks on economic issues with the Croatian side be held 
on June 16-17 in Plitvice in RSK territory, the office of the 
RSK president said in a statement on Wednesday. Martic made the 
decision after receiving additional international guarantees 
that all issues relating to the Croatia-Krajina conflict would 
in future be resolved through talks on an equal footing and that 
the international community would not tolerate Croatia's policy 
of force, the RSK news agency ISKRA reports. 
  Moreover, says ISKRA, Martic also received firm guarantees 
that a political settlement would not be prejudged in any stage 
of the talks and that it should be sought within the 
Geneva-based international conference on the former Yugoslavia. 
Martic's office also said that the RSK president had decided to 
agree to the talks after consultations with co-chairmen of the 
international conference Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg and 
U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi. 
  The RSK was founded in late 1991 in the Serb ancestral lands 
in Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession from the 
former Yugoslav federation and attempts to downgrade the Serbs 
to a national minority. In March 1992, the RSK was placed under 
U.N. protection. 
  Martic's talks with the international mediators in Geneva 
also tackled the implementation of the RSK-Croatia truce signed 
in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb last spring. The RSK president 
said that Croatia had not fully honoured the agreement and 
warned that this could seriuosly impede the peace process. 
  Akashi personally guaranteed that he would insist with the 
Croatian side to immediately meet the obligations it undertook 
under the truce agreement.

  [Text] A three-day visit by a Romanian delegation to our 
country has resulted in the signing of three important 
interstate treaties. This has confirmed our good interstate 
relations, but has also opened up the possibility to extend 
overall economic cooperation between the two countries. The 
Romanian prime minister and members of the Romanian state 
delegation also met Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
  President Tudjman and Romanian Prime Minister Vacaroiu had 
talks about political relations between the two countries, the 
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Croatia's occupied areas. 
They dwelled in particular on efforts made by the two countries 
and the international community with regard to achieving a 
negotiated end to the conflicts as soon as possible, and fully 
reintegrating Croatia'a occupied areas into the state and legal 
system of the Republic of Croatia. 
  In addition, Prime Minister Vacaroiu briefed President 
Tudjman on the talks being conducted between the Romanian 
delegation and Croatian officials and businessmen, and also on 
contracts about to be signed. 
  The possibilities and stimuli to the extension of 
comprehensive cooperation, particularly economic, were the main 
topics of the concluding round of talks between representatives 
of the Croatian and Romanian Governments. On the occasion, 
proposals were supported for setting up joint commissions and 
contact groups, which will be tasked with considering the 
establishment of larger-scale forms of economic cooperation. 
This refers to the founding of mixed enterprises and joint 
participation in third markets, and also to the conclusion of 
treaties on free trade between the two countries. 
  Transport, ferrous metallurgy, shipbuilding, the power 
industry, and almost all branches of light industry were 
highlighted as areas of particular interest. The Romanian 
partners are particularly interested in our experience in the 
operations of the free zone in the port of Rijeka. 
  The first step in widening cooperation was made by signing 
three important interstate treaties: on maritime transport, on 
stimulating and protecting joint investments, and on cooperation 
in health and medical science. Both prime ministers, following 
the official talks, stressed the friendly relations between the 
two countries and the importance of the signed treaties toward 
the development of comprehensive cooperation in the areas of 
science, education, culture, and sport. Prime Minister Valentic 
stressed that these negotiations have opened the way to full 
economic cooperation, adding: 
  [Begin Valentic recording] Romania is a large country in 
central and eastern Europe, and an important factor for peace 
and stability in Europe. Therefore, we believe that good and 
friendly relations between Croatia and Romania will make a 
considerable contribution toward peace in the entire region. We 
have accepted with great pleasure an invitation by the president 
to visit Romania, and we have set a date in September, when the 
Croatian Government is to send its delegation, including a large 
number of businessmen, to visit Bucharest. [end recording] 
  The Romanian prime minister stressed that his talks with 
President Tudjman, Prime Minister Valentic, and Croatian 
businessmen were very sincere, and that a mutually expressed 
wish for even better cooperation in all areas would soon be 
realized. Vacaroiu added that the Romanian Government wishes to 
intensify its presence in resolving the crisis on the territory 
of former Yugoslavia through political means, and that it urges 
the observance of borders of the newly created states in this 
area. Romania, according to him, wishes to join the 
reconstruction of war-ravaged areas of Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Both prime ministers announced that interstate treaties on 
the avoidance of double taxation and on cooperation between 
chambers of economy are being drawn up. These documents are 
likely to be signed during the aforementioned visit by the 
Croatian delegation to Romania.

  [Text] Zagreb, June 8 (AFP) -- A Canadian soldier with the 
UN forces has died in an apparent suicide, the UN Protection 
Force [UNPROFOR] said Wednesday. Private Kirk David Cooper, 25, 
from North Bay, Ontario, was at an observation post near the 
village of Kasic in southern Croatia on Monday "when it appears 
he decided to take his own life," the UN statement said. It 
said "an investigation is ongoing," adding that "it is not known 
what may have caused Private Cooper to take his own life." 
Cooper, who is the ninth Canadian peacekeeper to die in the 
former Yugoslavia since Canada began its peacekeeping mission 
two years ago, was on his second tour with the UN Force. He was 
an infantryman of the Third Battalion, Princess Patricia's 
Canadian Light Infantry, serving with the Canadian Battalion in 
Croatia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Parliament Chairman Stipe Mesic by Jovo </F>
Paripovic; place and date not given: "The HDZ Has a Hard Time 
Coping With Democracy"] 
  [Text] "There need not be a parliamentary and state crisis 
in Croatia, but there could be if unreasonable moves are made. 
Some of the reasons why we undertook to form the new party of 
Independent Croatian Democrats [HND] were the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the functioning of the law-governed state, 
the activity of the parliament, and the autonomy of the 
judiciary. We did not like the structure of the HDZ [Croatian 
Democratic Union], which has been turned into a bureaucratic 
organization that does not beat with a democratic pulse. Our 
move can only promote democracy, provided there is reason and 
the country is not pushed into crisis. This can only help 
Croatia to become more recognizable as a democratic society," 
Stipe Mesic explained the most recent political ferment for all 
NEDELJNA BORBA. 
  [Paripovic] How do you perceive the behavior of the HDZ and 
the president himself, Dr. Tudjman, following your move and that 
of Josip Manolic, president of the Chamber of Zupanijas? 
  [Mesic] The HDZ has had trouble coping with that basic 
postulate of democracy that people think differently about 
different problems. And when we were unable to fight for our 
positions within the party, we went public. That is why 
proceedings were immediately instituted to dismiss Mr. Manolic. 
I do not know how many deputies signed the motion for my 
dismissal. That is already pass now. That is deja vu: An order 
is issued from the president's office, and everything is set in 
motion. That is not a feature of democratic societies. Relations 
in parliament are different because of the new party's 
establishment, and we have proposed that we sit down and reach 
an agreement on the leadership of the parliament. This cannot be 
done through pressure. 
  [Paripovic] Did you expect reactions of that kind, which, as 
you say, are those familiar from the time that is now behind us? 
  [Mesic] I can say that I did expect it. As more and more 
time 
has passed, the party has hewed more and more to the model of 
the one-party system and has begun to beat with that pulse. This 
is not satisfactory to us. On the contrary, we have begun to 
shut ourselves off not with a Berlin Wall, but a Balkan wall. 
The president's office has been turned into a power center. It 
is possible from there to manipulate all the moves in 
parliament, even to decide on the choice of judges. Or indeed 
the name to be given to some club. That is not the president's 
affair. 
  [Paripovic] What are the sources of that kind of behavior? 
Does it come from President Tudjman or from the people who 
surround him? 
  [Mesic] Certainly there are several reasons. One is 
certainly 
the people around the president. They only became acquainted 
with him as the chief of state, while I, instead of their 
deference, have always presented my opinion to Tudjman without 
calculating whether he will take to it or not. The people around 
him have been telling him what they thought he wanted to hear. 
That is why he has been drawing the wrong conclusions, since the 
information he based them on was wrong. To some extent the fault 
is surely also his. 
  [Paripovic] How do yo assess the position of Franjo Tudjman? 
Since the move by you and Josip Manolic has he been uncertain 
what course to take, or "standing firm on his feet"? 
  [Mesic] I think he is not taking the right steps as soon as 
he moves against parliament. A war between the executive and 
legislative branches does not benefit democracy. In addition to 
preserving the position of the parliament, we also want to 
preserve the Office of the President, but only within the limits 
allowed him by the Constitution. 
  [Paripovic] Is it your assessment that you can remain at the 
head of the Croatian parliament? President Tudjman was explicit 
at his regular news conference that that post is reserved for a 
representative of the HDZ? 
  [Mesic] That will depend on the balance of power or an 
agreement among all factors in the parliament. If we agree to 
let that post go to the HDZ, we will let it go, but this cannot 
be settled over the telephone, not by gathering signatures, by 
raising an uproar. That is the Bolshevik syndrome. 
  [Paripovic] How do you see the destiny of the government? 
  [Mesic] The government has our support for the present. It 
has solved the problem of inflation. 
  [Paripovic] What if the opposition should gain the upper 
hand 
in the parliament? 
  [Mesic] Everything depends on how the government behaves. 
  [Paripovic] What are the things you have against President 
Tudjman and the HDZ in connection with the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Mesic] There are several culprits to blame for that war, 
and 
Milosevic is the biggest. He calculated that with war he could 
achieve those objectives of creating an expanded Serbia which 
were not achieved earlier. Those who wanted an expanded Croatia 
played into his hands. Through the Serbs in Croatia, which Bora 
Jovic told me were our problem and we should "do what we like 
with them," the fuse of war in Croatia was ignited although 
there were assurances that Serbia was interested in only 66 
percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The only way to achieve that 
was to escalate the war in Bosnia and in Herzegovina. And then 
we had problems in the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina, since 
if a Serbian republic was being created, so let's also create a 
Croatia in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Herzeg-Bosna was created with 
flags, its army, its government... as a response to the Serbian 
side. We opposed such moves, since it means disintegration of an 
internationally recognized entity. 
  [Paripovic] You are probably aware of more detailed 
information, but you do not wish to speak of it. Can we, then, 
deal in suppositions? Did Dr. Tudjman consent to the offer of 66 
percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Serbs? 
  [Mesic] I think not. 
  [Paripovic] Did that agreement include resettlement of Serbs 
and Croats? I would recall for you just two almost identical 
such movements of population of both Serbs and Croats in which 
both suffered. I am speaking of the Croats who left Ilok and 
environs and the Serbs who left western Slavonia? 
  [Mesic] As soon as the talk turned on humane resettlement of 
population, I saw a great danger there. When we see what has 
happened, then it is clear that Milosevic had Cyprus in mind as 
a model. He went against everything that was non-Serb with 
brutal force in order to clear out a space to make expanded 
Serbia. He counted on there being pressure on the Serbs from the 
other side. He did not take a risk in that respect, but he 
longed for that. Whether there was an agreement about that I do 
not know. That is another of the questions history will answer 
for us, but the fact is that the aim was to create ethnic 
borders. 
  [Paripovic] You have raised quite a few of those issues -- 
the issue of the money which the diaspora has been paying and 
which has disappeared, the question of apartments.... Do you 
think that Seks and others who obtained apartments for a song 
will simply pay for that or return them? You have raised the 
issue of the Mafia and its connection to the authorities, 
profiteering, murders.... You said that "they" are true Sisters 
of Mercy compared to "these." Do you think you can work that out? 
  [Mesic] Yes. The money from the diaspora went into certain 
accounts. Balance sheets have to be drawn up, so that we can see 
how much was spent for what. Distribution of apartments has been 
discontinued, and this must be worked out as part of the 
operation of the law-governed state, just like everything else 
that has been raised as an issue. Unlawful acts must be detected 
by those who are paid to do that. The Mafia began in Sicily as a 
political movement against the French. But the French departed 
long ago, and the Mafia has remained. I hope that this one in 
Croatia will be much shorter-lived. 
  [Paripovic] Will your moves have an effect on Dr. Tudjman 
and 
his autocratic way of governing the country, and will you remove 
some of the manifestations of power which even a monarch would 
not be ashamed of: the presidential aircraft, the yacht and, 
they say, the immense wealth of the entire Tudjman family? 
  [Mesic] I assume that Dr. Tudjman is a realistic politician. 
Realistic because he came to power precisely by respecting 
certain realities. That is why I think he will take the new 
realities into account. He must realize that our moves do not 
represent a destabilization of Croatia. Accordingly, if he draws 
the lessons from all this, it will be better both for him, and 
also for democracy and for Croatia. 
  [Paripovic] Is Defense Minister Gojko Susak one of the 
stumbling blocks between Manolic and you on the one hand, and 
not just the two of you, and President Tudjman on the other? 
  [Mesic] Yes. I think he is incompetent. 
  [Paripovic] But Tudjman continues to keep him close to his 
side, and he refers to those demanding his dismissal as "petty 
politicians." These days there are people in Croatia who 
interpret Tudjman's keeping Susak close by his side even as a 
possibility of dictatorship? 
  [Mesic] I do not believe in solutions outside the 
institutional framework. The European environment would hardly 
put up with that. Someone would have to stand behind such a 
move, just as someone has always stood behind every military 
dictatorship introduced up to now. Everything is clear 
concerning Susak. His resignation is being demanded. It does not 
interest us that he perhaps may have offered his resignation to 
Tudjman when they were playing tennis or over coffee. We want 
the resignation debated publicly, which does not mean that he 
must offer his resignation publicly after the debate. 
  [Paripovic] Why has Minister Susak become so dear to 
Tudjman's heart? 
  [Mesic] That I do not know. 
  [Paripovic] There is talk of a Herzegovinian lobby? 
  [Mesic] I think that there is a bit of exaggeration here 
about that Herzegovinian lobby. In every war people emerge who 
through their connections make it possible for others and 
themselves to get rich. The talk about the Herzegovinians began 
following several real cases of that kind, but there are "very 
good profiteers" among the Slavonians, those from Lika, the 
Dalmatians, and the Istrians. 
  [Paripovic] According to an assessment which need not be 
accurate, your parting of the ways with the HDZ should have 
occurred at the last party convention, where differentiation of 
what are provisionally referred to as "right" and "left" wings 
became evident? 
  [Mesic] So far the HDZ has responded to two historic 
challenges -- the first was leaving the communist system and the 
second formation of the Croatian state. It now faces a new 
challenge -- what kind of state that should be. Here the HDZ is 
not responding effectively enough. That division into "left" and 
"right" is artificial, and when anyone wanted to discredit us, 
then they simply referred to us as "on the left." It is not 
about that, but about who favors the law-governed and democratic 
state and who does not. Here the HDZ should draw the new 
lessons, not resort to Bolshevik models of the harangue, or bus 
in those who call us "heretics" and call for them to deal with 
us. That is not good for the HDZ, since it is now "tackling the 
external and internal enemy." That does not disturb us, and I am 
sorry that we recognize certain strivings in the HDZ which 
aspire to totalitarianism. Some people have grabbed up all the 
goods of this world, and they are not waiting to have those 
goods in the other world. They would like to set certain things 
in cement. The firm hand suits them at present, since any 
democratic thrust could take quite a bit of that back from them. 
  [Paripovic] Your mention of cement has given me my cue: Are 
you ready to take some of the responsibility in all this upon 
yourself for certain moves? Surely you are not taking it for 
granted that many will treat you with kid gloves in the session 
of the parliament? 
  [Mesic] They have never treated me with kid gloves. Even 
since 1963. I was in prison in Stara Gradiska, because I did not 
agree with the totalitarian system. Those totalitarians are now 
emerging once again. Those who persecuted me then are now 
orthodox members of the HDZ. But I will not mention names, since 
we have an agreement to that effect. There will not be any kid 
gloves, but I am not afraid of that, since the arguments are on 
our side. We have on our side public opinion in spite of 
Vrdoljak's television. And when you talk about cement, than I 
know that you are referring to the story that I wanted to buy my 
daughter a cement plant. She wanted to mortgage her house to go 
into that business, but that was abandoned. I have only what I 
have earned, and I have not gained anything from this regime. 
  [Paripovic] You say that public opinion is also with you. 
Can 
you conclude from that that the people are fed up with this 
regime? 
  [Mesic] The people are never completely satisfied with their 
state. And that is a good thing. But the people are bothered by 
those who are abusing the state. There is no danger of the state 
being destabilized. On the contrary -- the mafiosi will be 
destabilized and exposed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  I Will Not Cut a Deal With Tudjman </H5>
  [Paripovic] Have you had contacts with President Tudjman, 
and 
can it be said that a deal is being cut? 
  [Mesic] I have had talks with two representatives who came 
on 
the president's behalf. A third was supposed to come, but he 
went away on a business trip. What they are offering is 
bilateral talks. We are offering the opposition on the one side 
and the HDZ on the other, since now we belong to the opposition. 
I think that bilateral bargaining does not come under 
consideration now -- that is the message I sent back to the 
president. Positions should not be held onto jealously. I was 
not born in the position of president of the parliament, nor 
need I remain there. In the HDZ, and this is what their 
propaganda says, they are thinking that this is a power 
struggle. If that were the case, I would just go sit down 
alongside Tudjman, since under the Constitution I am his deputy, 
and for me personally everything could come up roses. But I am 
not dealing with my personal problems now. I want Croatia to be 
a democratic country. 
<H5>  [Box, p 10] </H5>
<H5>  "Agreement" Concerning the War </H5>
  [Paripovic] What were Franjo Tudjman's motives in 
negotiating 
with Milosevic at Karadjordjevo if he did not also have a desire 
for some expanded state? 
  [Mesic] Through Bora Jovic I proposed that we sit down 
together, he and Milosevic, Dr. Tudjman and I, and attempt to 
avoid war. An hour later Bora told me that he had passed on 
everything to Milosevic and the latter had agreed to the 
proposal. I passed that on to Tudjman, but I soon learned that 
only Tudjman and Milosevic would meet. I do not know what they 
agreed on, but we have seen how processes developed and how the 
war escalated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F>
Federation of Trade Unions in Hungary, by Lajos Pogonyi; place 
and date not given: "I Hope That There Will Be a Coalition! -- 
MSZOSZ Chairman Sandor Nagy Says"] 
  [Text] I have grown used to the fact that the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is very short-tempered with 
me. I more or less have an idea on the reason for this. I have 
mentioned it a number of times that I see Gyula Horn as suitable 
for the post of prime minister. Bekesi would be needed in the 
government, Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National Federation of 
Trade Unions in Hungary [MSZOSZ] and second person on the 
national list of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party], said in 
his interview with NEPSZABADSAG. 
  [Pogonyi] What is your view on the fact that, at a 
Democratic Charter event, Gyorgy Konrad mentioned Bekesi as an 
acceptable politician to lead a coalition government? 
  [Nagy] Obviously, everyone has his own view on who the prime 
minister should be. In my view, who the MSZP nominates to head 
the government is an internal matter. 
  [Pogonyi] Whom would you like to see as prime minister? 
  [Nagy] I have said it many times that, considering all 
factors, I see Gyula Horn as the suitable person for this 
position. 
  [Pogonyi] What are your views on the opinion of certain 
political analysts who believe that the MSZP should make heroic 
gestures when the coalition is being formed because the 
Socialists have won more than their true share [tulnyertek 
magukat]? 
  [Nagy] I do not know why the MSZP should make such gestures. 
In my view, the Socialists have simply won the confidence of the 
electors at a level that is indicated by the number of their 
mandates in the new Parliament. We must only start from this. 
I do not see why we should start from any other reason that is 
unknown to me. In fact, I believe that this election result 
actually provides an opportunity for the MSZP to form a 
government on a broader basis, not only considering a single 
party. 
  [Pogonyi] Ivan Vitanyi, chairman of the MSZP's national 
committee, told the "168 Ora" that he considered your latest 
statement in which you had saucily said that if the SZDSZ is not 
willing then there will be another partner to be very bad. 
  [Nagy] I have not said anything like this. 
  [Pogonyi] Perhaps in one of the "NAP-Kelte" programs last 
week.... 
  [Nagy] My words might have been misunderstood. I said that 
I considered a more than 50 percent mandate for the MSZP 
desirable because the issue of the coalition would not be 
decided on the basis of a constraint, the issue would not depend 
on whether another party wishes to form a coalition. This way, 
we can also address others. 
  [Pogonyi] It seems that a number of people might have 
misunderstood what you said.... 
  [Nagy] It is possible. 
  [Pogonyi] The other day, Bekesi confirmed that he would not 
accept a ministerial role if the MSZP is forced to form a 
government on its own. 
  [Nagy] I find this statement unfortunate. Bekesi would be 
very much needed in the government. If he rejects this because 
of the aforementioned circumstances then this is definitely a 
loss. 
  [Pogonyi] When did you last meet each other? 
  [Nagy] I can remember two important discussions in the past 
six to eight weeks. During one of them we only spoke about 
economic issues with the IMF's representative in Hungary. On 
the other occasion, I had asked to meet Bekesi before an 
election debate. This time, we reviewed the area of balance 
problems, foreign and domestic financial processes, and budget 
and asset issues. More precisely, I asked him to help Europe 
become familiar with some macroeconomic facts and 
interconnections. 
  [Pogonyi] According to many people, you are the MSZP's 
bogey-man for the SZDSZ. 
  [Nagy] I have already grown to the fact that the SZDSZ is 
very short-tempered with me. I more or less know the reason, 
too. 
  [Pogonyi] Tell me! 
  [Nagy] I would not like to embark on a long story. 
Presumably, the point is that I am not one of those who always 
and under all circumstances accepts everything the Free 
Democrats say. Namely that they know everything best. In my 
view, other parties also have capable people, experts, and 
honest politicians. I do not believe that a party has the right 
to attribute the ability always to fulfill the best roles solely 
to itself. I always express this view and I believe that this 
is one of the reasons I am not popular with them. 
  [Pogonyi] Would you be able to support a liberal economic 
policy? 
  [Nagy] I can support the economic policy that is in the 
MSZP's program. This is pragmatic, has many liberal elements, 
and one can also find the values of a social democratic party in 
it. We have lined up in support of this economic policy and not 
in support of something else. 
  [Pogonyi] Horn recently said that, according to some 
economic observers, the MSZP's economic policy might have more 
liberal elements than that of the SZDSZ. What is your view on 
this? 
  [Nagy] I think that we would need to clarify the terms. I 
do not know how Horn meant this remark, it was presumably part 
of a longer sentence. The MSZP's economic policy is a factual 
and pragmatic package that does not lack sensitivity toward 
social problems. 
  [Pogonyi] Finally: Will there be a coalition? 
  [Nagy] The decision is not up to me. However, believe me, I 
most sincerely hope that there will be.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "How Do the Programs of Future </F>
Coalition Parties Differ?"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 
  On Privatization: 
  The experts agree that privatization has become an 
irreversible process, one that must also be continued in the 
future. However, there are some differences of views regarding 
the speed of this process. The Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] are urging the reduction of state property to a minimum 
and, thus, they want to get rid of the state property as soon as 
possible. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] however, thinks 
that it is necessary to thoroughly consider the pace at which 
the state property is reduced. The MSZP also thinks that the 
number of factories, banks, and other enterprises owned by the 
state should be reduced to below the level set out by the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]. [passage omitted] 
  On the Fate of Privatization Income: 
  While the MSZP argues in favor of reviving enterprises, 
creating jobs, and covering the debts accumulated by state 
enterprises, the SZDSZ prefers quick privatization to "renewal 
and selling," but privatization to new owners capable of 
accumulating capital, of modernizing, and of saving jobs. 
  On Economic Progress: 
  There are differences of emphasis between the economic 
programs. Both parties say that, contrary to what the current 
government claims, the conditions for economic revival will have 
to be created now. Both parties see possibilities of a small 
economic growth around 1996, but this will hardly be noticeable 
in the people's standard of living. The first goal is to 
restore the upset economic balance and to halt the tremendous 
foreign economic deficit and the increase in the budget deficit. 
Both parties find it important to make use of the economic 
contacts with the European Union and to gain new markets. 
However, the MSZP thinks that Hungary will have little chance 
of a large-scale increase in exports because of the economic 
recession prevailing in the West and the internal market defense 
in the West. Therefore, the MSZP would like to regain the 
Eastern markets, the markets of the former Soviet member states. 
The MSZP admits that we can only think of barter trade because 
of the financial difficulties and lack of capital there. 
Because of the bad experiences of previous years, the SZDSZ 
does not agree with this idea. [passage omitted] 
  On the Budget: 
  According to the MSZP, the most important task is to halt 
state waste and avoid the unpredictable growth of our foreign 
and domestic debt. The goal of the MSZP is to reduce expenses, 
the deficit, and also the withdrawals first of all by reducing 
expenses on state administration and other low-efficiency 
expenses. 
  The SZDSZ wants to reduce the budget deficit by streamlining 
the executive state apparatus, reforming the army, reducing 
management expenses, and cutting social payments to people who 
are not in need. 
  On the Tax System: 
  Both parties promise a stabilization of the tax system. The 
MSZP would try to achieve this by considerably reducing the 
corporation taxes, eliminating the taxes on forint and hard 
currency interest and the minimal tax, restoring the advantages 
of foreign investors, making investment incomes free of tax, and 
taxing property accumulation. Reducing the weight of income tax 
and increasing the role of consumer taxes also appears in their 
program. 
  The SZDSZ: Investment tax benefits for Hungarian and foreign 
entrepreneurs; taking over wage costs from entrepreneurs who 
create jobs; restoring the contract tax of small entrepreneurs; 
increasing the role of local governments in taxation at the 
detriment of central withdrawals. [passage omitted] 
  On Trade Unions: 
  The SZDSZ does not regard as fortunate that the chairman of 
the largest trade union in the country is sitting in Parliament 
as a government party deputy. The SZDSZ thinks that this mixes 
up the role of employee interest representation with the task of 
the executive power. This is mostly a political difference of 
views between the two parties. According to the MSZP, the 
so-called tripartite talks between the trade unions and the 
government [government-employers-employees] are the guarantee 
that no essential decisions in the economic and social sphere 
are made without a broad consensus. [passage omitted] 
  On Hungary's Neighbors: 
  According to the MSZP, Hungary needs rapprochement and 
bilateral and regional cooperation with its neighbors. "We want 
to trade, rather than engage in litigations." The MSZP promises 
the confirmation of open borders and full assertion of national 
minority rights by international law, and they are urging the 
creation of an efficient international system of national 
minority protection. 
  According to the SZDSZ, economic and political cooperation 
is 
the basic guarantee for Hungary's security. Bilateral 
agreements should guarantee (traversable) borders and the 
assertion of national minority rights. National minority 
protection goals should be formulated in which we can find 
partners among the international organizations and the majority 
democratic forces in our neighbors. 
  On NATO and the European Union: 
  The MSZP says that the conditions of joining the European 
Union must be created as soon as possible. Hungary's relations 
with NATO should be further developed, but NATO membership is 
not the only guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum 
should decide on joining both organizations. 
  The SZDSZ says that we should not force a deadline for 
preparations for integration; instead, we should set out our own 
pace so that Hungary becomes suitable to join the Union as soon 
as possible. According to the SZDSZ, a broad social consensus 
must be achieved regarding the issue of integration. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Attila Agh, head of the Department of </F>
Political Sciences at the Budapest Economics University, by 
Katalin Torok; place and date not given: "A Stable Party System 
With Question Marks"] 
  [Text] The Hungarian society has voted freely for the 
second time. Out of the 364 deputies of the Hungarian 
parliament, 63 percent are new faces. Not a single 
nonparliamenary party succeeded in exceeding the 5-percent 
threshold. At the same time, the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP] gained 54.15 percent in the recent elections. We asked 
Attila Agh about the long-term effects of the results of the 29 
May elections. 
  [Agh] The "six-party system" has become stronger. We can 
really see the spectacular nature of this development if we 
compare the situation with the neighboring countries: Nothing 
close to this occurred in Slovakia or Poland, for example. In 
other words, this shows the firm stability of the Hungarian 
party system and the fact that this party system began 
developing as early as the second half of the 1980's. 
Essentially, there has been no "newcomer" since 1987-88, 
although the small parties saw the possibility of getting into 
parliament around 1992-93, but this hope fizzled away in 1994. 
In the 176 election districts, the candidates who made it into 
parliament almost exclusively came from the six parties. All 
this is very rare, and it is a very Hungarian particularity. 
  [Torok] What is the situation of the parties that can be 
called stable? 
  [Agh] In Central Europe, the right of the political spectrum 
is generally more fragmented than the left. In my opinion, there 
will be a balanced party system in Central Europe when there is 
a consolidated center right. 
  [Torok] What is the cause of this phenomenon? 
  [Agh] The right-wing parties failed to modernize and the 
institutional continuity broke up; there is only some kind of a 
cultural and mental continuity here. If we had fallen on the 
other side of the Iron Curtain after World War II, it is 
possible that the Smallholders might have been forced to 
modernize. It transpired at the latest elections that the 
supporters of the clearly Christian-national middle class trend 
of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are to be found in the 
Buda districts. The Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 
only focuses on the church issue out of a multitude of issues, 
and this gives them a sure 7 percent, but not more. In other 
words, this preserves their small-party nature. 
  [Torok] What future do you envisage for the right-wing 
parties? 
  [Agh] I envisage a lasting and very sad future for them. As 
long as they are unable to overcome their fragmentation, they 
will have few prospects ahead. We must seek the reasons for 
their strong historical continuity in the fact that their base 
of officeholders was not poor, although they have often been 
humiliated. They preserved their class situation and mentality, 
and they even passed this on to their children. This is why the 
late Jozsef Antall was a liberating experience for them. 
  [Torok] In your view, what does the landslide victory of the 
MSZP mean? 
  [Agh] The MSZP has no idea of the amount of difficulties 
they are facing, including economic problems, but let the 
economists speak about them. Contrary to many people, I think 
that the party itself does not have any factions today; there 
are only various cultural trends there, but factions might 
emerge in the future, namely three factions. Mathematically, 
there are bigger chances for a 209-member faction to fall into 
three parties, because the MDF started with fewer members in 
1990, and the results are well known. In my opinion, the big 
question is whether the MSZP will be able to deal with these 
difficulties, because it is possible that various trends will 
find a political expression in the wake of social conflicts. 
  [Torok] Concretely, what trends and groupings do you have in 
mind? 
  [Agh] First of all, a technocratic-administrative trend. 
They will be the ones who argue professionally and concentrate 
on solving everyday problems. Another possible trend is made up 
of people who make a professional and ideological problem from 
the problems of the provinces. I would like to stress that I do 
not mean here the often mentioned popular-national trend whose 
alleged leader is Matyas Szuros; this is the chewing gum of 
ill-informed correspondents. This group will say that Budapest 
is not the center of the world, that it is important to develop 
the provinces, and that politics should serve the interests of 
the whole country. Finally, I regard the demagogic designation 
of the interests of the working class as the third trend. I 
would immediately add that I do not mean here the often 
mentioned trade union line; I mean that interests emerge here 
that might lead politics in the direction of preserving the 
interests and values of a classic working class. 
  [Torok] It seems that the so-called trade union line also 
causes a lot of trouble to the possible coalition partners.... 
  [Agh] As I said before, I do not see this as an acute danger 
in the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ]. 
I would also list them in the first group because they are 
capable of evaluating the changing world of Hungarian employees 
dynamically. I think that one who believes the trade union is 
naive enough to think that the current level of metallurgy in 
northern Hungary can be maintained definitely does not know 
Sandor Nagy and the other outstanding trade unions leaders. 
  [Torok] Can you envisage an internal struggle between these 
trends within the MSZP? 
  [Agh] I think there are possibilities for the emergence of 
three such trends, and the order of appearance is also an order 
of power. I do not think these groups will separate very much 
in personnel, because one can join one group in connection with 
one problem and another group in connection with another 
problem. I hope the MSZP will be able to deal with this problem 
and avoid the breaking up of the party into different parties. 
It is also important that the MSZP avoid the situation in which 
there is a dialogue and trends within the party but a 
monopolistic demand outside. I find openness very important, 
especially toward the intellectuals.

Union's debt to the Czech side. 
  [Begin Prime Minister Klaus recording] The government is 
aware that this is the maximum possible that could have been

government is happy with a sparrow in the hand, although some 
people may have hoped for a fat pigeon--not even on the roof but 
in the skies. The results and advantages of this solution are 
very considerable indeed. [end recording] 
  According to Klaus, the size of the debts involved, the 
interest rates, and the schedules have all been definitively 
agreed upon. According to the agreement, our Republic should 
receive $52 million by the end of this year, $100 million in 
1995, and almost $400 million in 1996. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "What the Benes Decrees Actually </F>
Are"] 
  [Text] Theo Waigel, federal finance minister and chairman 
of the Bavarian Christian Social Union, demanded at the Sudeten 
German Days, which were held last weekend, that the so-called 
Benes Decrees be annulled. All Czech political representatives 
have rejected this demand as unacceptable. Foreign Minister 
Josef Zieleniec even declared that complying with such efforts 
would mean "revising the outcome of World War II, with all of 
the repercussions arising from it." 
  Of course, the "Benes Decrees," rejected by the Sudeten 
Germans, in fact represent only part of the several dozen 
legislative acts that altered the entire legal being of the 
Czechoslovak establishment, acts that cannot simply be annulled 
in toto if we do not want to risk legal chaos. The common 
denominator of these decrees was President Benes, who issued 
them from 1940 onwards--of course, only after listening to the 
government in exile and the so-called State Council, which 
supplemented legislative authority. The Council was abolished 
after May 1945, and the decrees were issued on the 
recommendation of the government and the Slovak National Council 
[SNR]. Following the elections to the Interim National Assembly 
in October 1945, legal order was guaranteed by normal laws. 
  Today, we bring you select sections of these decrees that 
concern the actual issue of the evacuation of the Sudeten 
Germans. 
<H8>  Decree Issued by the President of the Republicon 25 </H8>
October 1945 on Confiscating Enemy Propertyand on National 
Revival Funds 
  On the recommendation of the government and after agreement 
with the Slovak National Council, I decree the following: 
<H8>  Part I </H8>
<H8>  The Confiscation of Enemy Property </H8>
  Article 1. The definition of confiscated property 
is as follows: 
  (1) Real estate and chattels--namely, property rights (such 
as outstanding claims, bonds, deposits, intangible 
rights)--that, on the day of the factual termination of the 
German and Hungarian occupation, was or still is in the 
ownership of the following is confiscated without compensation, 
unless this has already occurred, on behalf of the Czechoslovak 
Republic: 
  i. The German Reich, the Kingdom of Hungary, persons of 
public law in accordance with German or Hungarian law, the 
German Nazi Party, Hungarian political parties, and the other 
associations, organizations, enterprises, facilities, personal 
affiliations, funds, and endowments of these regimes or 
associated with them, and also other German or Hungarian legal 
persons, or 
  ii. Physical persons of German or Hungarian ethnicity, with 
the exception of persons who prove that they remained loyal to 
the Czechoslovak Republic and never committed an offense against 
the Czech and Slovak peoples and either took an active part in 
the struggle for their liberation or suffered under the Nazi or 
fascist terror, or 
  iii. Physical persons who were involved in activity 
oriented against the state's sovereignty, independence, and 
integrity, the democratic-republican state structure, and the 
security and defense of the Czechoslovak Republic, who aided and 
abetted such activity or sought to corrupt other persons, who 
deliberately supported in any way the German or Hungarian 
occupiers, or who, during the period of heightened risk to the 
Republic (Article 18 of the decree issued by the president of 
the Republic on 19 June 1945 on punishing Nazi criminals, 
traitors, and their supporters and on the extraordinary people's 
courts), indulged in Germanization or Magyarization on the 
territory of the Czechoslovak Republic or behaved inimically 
toward the Czechoslovak Republic or the Czech or Slovak peoples, 
and also persons who condoned such activity among the persons 
administering their property or enterprise. 
  (2) The stipulations contained in Paragraph 1 No. iii also 
apply to legal persons if it is possible to attribute blame to 
the physical persons who are their members or who are 
shareholders in the property or enterprise (capital 
participants) for the course of action of the body representing 
the legal person or if these persons did not take appropriate 
caution in electing and supervising it. 
  (3) All of the property that, in the period after 29 
September 1938, belonged to the entities cited in Paragraphs 1 
and 2 and was, during the pertinent period in accordance with 
Paragraph 1, first sentence, or, respectively, still is in the 
ownership of persons in whose care it would not be subject to 
confiscation is also subject to confiscation. 
  (4) The relevant district national committee will decide 
if the conditions for confiscation have been fulfilled in 
accordance with this decree. The decision can be delivered by a 
public edict, even though the preconditions of Article 33 of the 
government regulation issued on 13 January 1928 on the procedure 
in matters that pertain to the activity of political offices 
(administrative proceedings) have not been fulfilled. It is 
possible to appeal to the land national committee (to the 
relevant SNR body in Slovakia) against the decision of the 
district national committee. The land national committee (the 
relevant SNR body in Slovakia) may, even during the proceedings, 
assume control of the proceedings and decide in the first 
instance on the matter. If the land national committee (the 
relevant SNR body in Slovakia) makes a decision in the first 
instance, it is possible to appeal to the Interior Ministry 
against its decision. The interior minister may further amend 
the method of decisionmaking by issuing directives in accordance 
with this article. 
  Article 2. Exemptions from confiscation and 
providing compensation: 
  (1) That part of the chattels of the persons cited in 
Article 1, Paragraph 1, Nos. ii and iii that is indispensable, 
for instance, for satisfying vital needs or for the personal 
performance of the employment of these persons and their family 
members (such as clothing, bedding, linen, domestic implements, 
food, and tools) is exempt from confiscation. The government 
will stipulate by decree the details on the range of this 
property. 
  (2) The government may stipulate by decree that the property 
of a specific group of persons falling under the stipulations 
contained in Article 1 is exempt partially or wholly from 
confiscation. 
  (3) Property that, during the period after 29 September 
1938, was forfeited under the pressure of the occupation or as a 
consequence of national, racial, or political persecution by 
persons who do not come under the stipulations of Article 1 is 
not subject to confiscation. 
<H8>  Decree Issued by the President of the Republicon 19 June </H8>
1945 on the Confiscation andSpeedy Distribution of the 
Agricultural Propertyof Germans, Hungarians, and 
Traitorsand Enemies of the Czech and Slovak Peoples

  (1) Agricultural property in the ownership of the following 
is confiscated for the purposes of land reform with immediate 
effect and without compensation: 
  a) All persons of German and Hungarian ethnicity, 
regardless of citizenship; 
  b) Traitors and enemies of the Republic of any ethnicity 
and citizenship who manifested this hostility during the crisis 
and war of 1938-45 in particular; 
  c) Shareholding and other companies and corporations whose 
administrations deliberately and intentionally served Germany's 
conduct of the war or fascist and Nazi purposes. 
  (2) In accordance with Paragraph 1, the agricultural 
property of persons of German and Hungarian ethnicity who took 
an active part in the struggle to preserve the integrity and 
liberty of the Czechoslovak Republic will not be confiscated. 
  (3) The relevant district national committee will decide, on 
the recommendation of the relevant agricultural commission, if 
it is possible to make an exception in accordance with Paragraph 
2. The district national committee will submit borderline cases

their expert opinion, to the Agriculture Ministry for a final 
decision. It will be made in agreement with the Interior 
Ministry. 
  Article 2. 
  (1) Persons who in any census since 1929 have claimed German 
or Hungarian nationality or who became members of national 
groups or associations or political parties affiliating persons 
of German or Hungarian nationality are considered to be persons 
of German or Hungarian nationality. 
  (2) Exemptions from the stipulations contained in Paragraph 
1 will be determined by a special decree. 
  Article 3. 
  (1) The following are considered to be traitors and enemies 
of the Czechoslovak Republic: 
  a) Persons who collectively or individually were involved 
in activity oriented against the state's sovereignty, 
independence, and integrity, the democratic-republican state 
structure, the security and defense of the Czechoslovak 
Republic, who aided and abetted such activity or sought to 
corrupt other persons, and who in any way deliberately and 
actively supported the German and Hungarian occupiers; 
  b) Of legal persons, those whose administration 
deliberately and actively served the German or Hungarian conduct 
of the war or fascist and Nazi purposes.

will consider the issue again in regular proceedings in which 
the significant legal stipulations of this decree (Articles 
1-20) apply as if the culprit had been brought before a regular 
court immediately beforehand (Article 21). The recommendation 
that such proceedings be instituted against the accused, 
however, must be submitted within three months at the latest 
from the day of acquittal. 
  Article 26. 
  (1) Proceedings before an extraordinary people's court are 
initiated on the recommendation of the public prosecutor 
(Article 24). Pregnant women will not be brought before the 
extraordinary people's court during the term of their pregnancy. 
  (2) The entire proceedings against an accused individual 
will take place, where possible, without interruption from the 
beginning to the end before the MLS; the proceedings against the 
accused individual must not last more than three days. 
  Article 31. 
  (1) There are no legal remedies against the verdict of the 
MLS. A request submitted by anyone for a reprieve has no 
suspensive effect. 
  (2) The death penalty will be carried out, as a rule, within 
two hours of the verdict's being delivered. This term may be 
extended by a further hour at the request of the condemned. If 
the proceedings were held in the absence of the accused, the 
death sentence will be carried out within 24 hours of the 
apprehension of the accused. 
  (3) The MLS may also decide that the death penalty is to be 
carried out publicly. This will be done especially if the 
callous way in which the crime was committed, or the perverted 
nature of the culprit, or the number of his crimes, or his 
standing warrant the public implementation of the verdict. In 
this case, the court may, in order to accommodate the public in 
the implementation of the punishment, extend the two-hour 
deadline, but for no longer than 24 hours.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The remaining 
disputed issues concern western and eastern Herzegovina, Posanje 
(the Sana river valley), the towns of Krupa na Uni, Prijedor, 
Sanski Most, Podrinje, the towns of Gorazde, Visegrad, and the 
wider Srebrenica area -- territories they wish to take away from 
the Serbs." This was stated by Momcilo Krajisnik, president of 
the republic of Srpska's national assembly, in a statement for 
today's edition of GLAS SRPSKI of Banja Luka. He said that the 
republic of Srpska delegation pointed to the shortcomings of 
their demand to cede 51 percent of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to the Muslim-Croat federation if the quality and quantity of 
the territory is not taken into account. 
  "We explained that the tendency to expand Muslim and 
Croatian 
territories at the expense of the Serbs is unacceptable and in 
poor taste," Krajisnik said, adding that the Serbs cannot 
possibly renounce lands that represent a vital interest of the 
Serbian nation, as is the case with Posavina. 
  "They envisage only a narrow corridor for the republic of 
Srpska, although this territory is the only link the western 
Serb lands have with Serbia proper," Krajisnik said in his 
statement for "GLAS SRPSKI." "In any case, this territory is of 
much greater importance to the Serbs than it could be to the 
Croats or Muslims."

<F P=106> [Interview with Ejup Ganic, vice chairman of the Federation </F>
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by S. Lovrenovic; place and date not 
given: "The Federation Is `Stalingrad' for a Greater Serbia"] 
  [Text] It was difficult to reach Mr. Ejup Ganic after 
his election, although he wanted to keep his promise and give an 
interview for VECERNJI LIST, a promise he gave before the 
election. He found the time for this interview after the session 
of the general assembly and before the beginning of a new round 
of Geneva negotiations. 
  [Lovrenovic] What are your first impressions as the vice 
chairman of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina? What are your 
first tasks and duties? 
  [Ganic] There is a lot of work, but there is much enthusiasm 
and cooperation, too. Our work is very responsible. I think 
that we are at a turning point in history now. This is a 
special moment, and we must not miss this chance. 
<H5>  Cooperation With Zubak </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] You have been elected together with Mr. Zubak. 
What is the cooperation between the president and the vice 
president immediately after the election like? 
  [Ganic] The cooperation is functioning quite normally. We 
met in Sarajevo a month ago, but we could talk for only 10 
minutes. Then we worked together during the Vienna negotiations 
for three or four days. Our cooperation was very intense there. 
We both participated in the talks that took place in France, 
too. This is normal since we are both working on the same 
tasks. I can say that our contacts have always been 
professional, we have always reached agreement on things that 
had to be agreed upon. We have similar methods of work, so that 
I hope that we shall be able to achieve results in the interests 
of both the Muslim and the Croatian population in the Federation 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, naturally, to the benefit of the 
whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Lovrenovic] There were no problems with the election, but 
have you perhaps noticed a certain resistance toward the 
Federation? 
  [Ganic] There is a long and very steep path before us. It 
will be difficult, but the agreement on the Federation is very 
important, so that certain groups of people or individuals who 
oppose it should be given no powers whatsoever to thwart this 
historic process. I would like to repeat that the Federation is 
"Stalingrad" for a greater Serbia. 
<H5>  Serbian Annexation Policy Stopped </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Why do you think that this will be a turning 
point in the relations with the Serbs? 
  [Ganic] This is a concept that will enable Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which are internationally recognized, to 
retain their borders. It will also stop the Serbian annexation 
policy. This is something that has repeated itself every 20 
years in the Balkans. Territories and properties have been 
seized little by little, but we shall bring an end to this 
policy. Apart from that, we would like to find a formula for a 
new military balance. The Federation is opening new 
possibilities for both Bosnia and Croatia. We are not 
conspiring against anybody, this is only a healthy and logical 
concept since both nations have a tendency toward the Western 
type of democracy. They have their historical roots in this 
area, they are close to the Western civilization character. 
  [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that you support a confederation 
with Croatia? After you become the president of the Federation, 
according to the rotation principle, will you try to bring this 
concept into existence? 
  [Ganic] Bosnia has always supported a confederation with 
Croatia. Croatia will more or less determine the scope of the 
confederation agreement. It has the sea, we have electrical 
energy, they have more food. There is compatibility between our 
economies and communications. We have similar friends in the 
world. There is much logic behind this. We are not doing 
anything behind anybody's back. Our cooperation is the result 
of democratic processes that are going on in Europe, or rather 
of the integration of economic interests. We shall try to unite 
our interests with the Croatian. 
  [Lovrenovic] There were rumors in Sarajevo during the 
session of the assembly that the Washington agreements were 
opposed by the ruling party, the SDA [Party of Democratic 
Action], which is also your party. 
  [Ganic] There was no resistance to these agreements. People 
just asked certain questions. The Federation is the best 
possibility of saving Bosnia-Herzegovina as an entity. We hope 
to see its revival in every part of our territory. We do not 
want to change its borders and we want to reduce those Serbs who 
are not loyal to the limits they are entitled to. In other 
words there were only questions about what, how, where, how 
much, who supported it etc., but there was no resistance. Our 
party [SDA] is not homogeneous, there are groups and individuals 
who always ask questions and have contradictory opinions. 
<H5>  Rotation Every Six Months </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Some time ago the SDA proposed that Mr. 
Izetbegovic should be the president of the Federation, but this 
proposal was withdrawn later on and you were subsequently 
proposed for that function. Is this true? 
  [Ganic] The SDA Executive Committee made that proposal 
without having consulted Mr. Izetbegovic. In the negotiations 
with Croatia we discussed all issues, though. Borders, cantons, 
the government, as well as the functions of the president and 
the vice president. During the negotiations Mr. Izetbegovic 
himself proposed making the concession to the Croatian people to 
appoint a Croatian national as first president of the 
Federation, although we have a larger population. The proposal 
that I should run for the position of vice chairman came later 
on. Mr. Izetbegovic made these proposals because is the party 
leader. Apart from that, by appointing me vice president of the 
Federation, he distributed the burden of responsibility to two 
persons. 
  Later on we agreed on the six-month rotation principle. The 
most important thing, however, is that the Parliament, the 
government, the president and the vice chairman cooperate. I 
think that this is a good solution. The fact that the first 
Federation president is Croatian is important, too. 
  [Lovrenovic] Will you automatically become president in six 
months, or...? 
  [Ganic] According to the Vienna agreement there should 
automatically be a change after six months. I am not insisting 
on my election to the position of the president of the 
Federation. It is more important that we complete everything we 
started in these six months, the elections and peace 
negotiations; then we can elect a new president, too. 
<H5>  Izetbegovic's Deputy </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Are you a member of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] I had, more or less, the function of Mr. 
Izetbegovic's deputy during his journeys. It will be a useful 
experience for the work as the Federation vice president. I 
would like to point out that the Federation is a special task. 
We have to organize the life in its Muslim part. Our most 
important task is to make official authorities more efficient 
and to establish traffic communications and economic relations. 
Apart from that, we have to finally close the ditches between 
the Croatian Defense Council and the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
We should enable our people to return to their homes. The 
Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina represents the internationally 
recognized state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I do not see any 
problems here. 
  [Lovrenovic] Is it not difficult to accept two presidencies, 
two parliaments, and two governments? 
  [Ganic] These are not two states, though. The whole state 
belongs to us, only certain parts of it are occupied. The task 
of the Parliament, the president and the vice president will be 
to make the Federation function. In the process of personnel 
structure and diplomatic network development it will be 
important that the Federation starts functioning as soon as 
possible. We must send those people into the diplomatic service 
who will be able to make the biggest contribution to the 
development of our Federation. The more powerful the Federation 
is, the more powerful will be our capacity to defend ourselves. 
I think that we shall have to agree on the distribution of 
ambassadors' posts. 
<H5>  Appointment of Ambassadors </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Can you give me an example of who will be 
appointed ambassador to Great Britain and France? Will you and 
Mr. Zubak appoint these people, or the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] As long as we are in a state of war, the state has 
to be represented by the Presidency, but Mr. Zubak and I shall 
make proposals about who should be appointed ambassador. 
  [Lovrenovic] Does this mean that the foreign policy will 
remain within the scope of work of the Presidency of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] Yes, but this is because the Presidency is an 
internationally recognized subject. Mr. Zubak and I shall 
certainly have to agree on where a representative of the 
Croatian people will be posted. 
  [Lovrenovic] This means that the Federation is not a legal 
subject according to international law and that it cannot have 
diplomatic and consular representatives. 
  [Ganic] It is not a legal subject according to international 
law. Neither does it have its representatives. Its 
representatives are the representatives of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is an internationally recognized state. 
  [Lovrenovic] You do not believe in a new Yugoslav state, but 
you have invited the Serbs to stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Does 
this mean that you believe in their coexistence in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] Yes. We have invited them to stay so that they can 
learn to respect human rights. 
<H5>  Will the Serbs Stay in Bosnia-Herzegovina? </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Do you really think they will stay in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
  [Ganic] We shall not allow the borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to change. We shall not interfere with the Serbian policy in 
those regions where they have a majority, but we shall oppose a 
greater Serbia. We shall oppose the annexation of our 
territory, too. They cannot create a greater Serbia unless they 
seize the territory in which the Muslims and the Croats are the 
major population. 
  [Lovrenovic] You invited the Serbs to join the federation 
before the election.... 
  [Ganic] I would like to point out that I have never done 
anything against Serbia. I have always had fair relations 
toward the Serbs and have helped those Serbs who have supported 
Bosnia. From the session of the parliament during the election I 
sent a political message to the Serbs. 
  [Lovrenovic] Do you believe that the Federation will soon 
start functioning in the full meaning of that word? 
  [Ganic] I do, otherwise I would not have started working on 
that project. I usually refuse projects that cannot be 
implemented since I am very analytical. I make my decisions 
based on my personal attitude and relevant political 
circumstances, I never get involved in matters that have no 
chance. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  No "Common Apartment" </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] Will "the mixed cantons," that were agreed on 
in Vienna, make the Federation stronger, or will they become a 
"powder keg?" 
  [Ganic] I think they will make the Federation stronger. 
There is no reason why they should become a "powder keg." 
  [Lovrenovic] Will they not be like a "common apartment?" 
  [Ganic] There is no "common apartment" here. We shall have 
common roads, rivers, electric power plants, but our estates 
will be divided. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  I Was the First To Go to Ravno </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] You have given several interviews so far, one 
of which -- the one published in GLOBUS -- was interpreted as 
anti-Croatian. 
  [Ganic] Some papers are full of fantasy. You should follow 
my attitudes, my publications, my statements for CNN and other 
television stations. You should forget compiled interviews I 
have never given to anybody. 
  [Lovrenovic] Have you given an interview to Mr. Brljevic 
from GLOBUS? 
  [Ganic] I gave him an interview some time ago, but he made 
several interviews later on, without having interviewed me. He 
made compilations and invented things. GLOBUS tends to invent 
certain things. I am a serious politician, though. I have 
presented my political attitudes in the 60 articles I have 
published so far, so that it can be proved that I have been 
making a consistent policy toward the Croatian people since the 
very beginning. I hope that you can remember that I was the 
first one to go to Ravno. I have visited the whole of 
Herzegovina and said what was good and what was bad there. I 
have been very consistent. The interview in GLOBUS was a cheap 
campaign against me without argument. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Sandzak Is a Part of Bosnia </H5>
  [Lovrenovic] You were reproached for having declared 
yourself a Yugoslav before, alluding to your birthplace. 
  [Ganic] Everybody is born somewhere. Apart from that, 
Sandzak is a part of Bosnia. The first amputation made at the 
Berlin Congress harmed Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the Muslims 
remained there. I am a Muslim to the same extent as someone who 
was born in Sarajevo. My birthplace is completely irrelevant in 
this context. On the other hand, I have to say that the Muslims 
were very loyal to the former Yugoslavia. We even tried to save 
that state, but since Milosevic wanted to create a greater 
Serbia, our love disappeared. I had a pro-Yugoslav orientation 
during the time Yugoslavia existed, I supported a democratic 
Yugoslavia, like many other Muslims, but I could not support a 
"Serboslavia." What is more, I opposed that kind of Yugoslavia. 
I was the first to write articles about the intentions of the 
Yugoslav People's Army, which caused political discussions. 
  [Lovrenovic] Would you support a democratic Yugoslavia today 
-- an option offered by certain Western circles? 
  [Ganic] I do not think that Serbia could adapt to it. The 
change was too big. Even the opposition in Serbia uses 
nationalism as the only political platform. I think that it is 
an illusion to speak about a new Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris </F>
Silajdzic by Dragan Banjac in Sarajevo; date not given: "All 
Doors Are Open to Bosnia"] 
  [Text] "I have spent more time in Belgrade than the entire 
Serbian leadership in Pale," said Dr. Haris Silajdzic, prime 
minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina and until recently its foreign 
minister. Although he rarely gives interviews, this one, he 
said, was, as it were, uncontested, and after the observation 
given above as the original title he continued with a serious, 
almost leaden, expression and a quiet, even-pitched voice. 
  "As I said, I have spent quite a bit of time in the capital 
of Yugoslavia, and I keep on wondering: What happened? What 
happened to the environment in which people were the first and 
most free in raising their head against the tyranny of the 
former regime. I know that there have been attempts at 
clustering of groups and individuals, statements against the 
aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, but all of that is 
surprisingly little and feeble." 
  [Banjac] What happened here in Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] Should I say that what happened here was war! 
That 200,000 people have been killed, that people here murdered, 
raped, and massacred... mainly non-Serbs -- Muslims. In any 
case, there seems to be an erroneous idea of Bosnia, especially 
of Muslims. It is one thing to lie to someone else and something 
else to lie to yourself. As though knowledge of this republic 
never went beyond jokes and consideration of it as a twilight 
zone. This corresponds to the notion that the officers force-fed 
into many people's minds. Not much is known even about Sarajevo. 
You people there are still associating us too much (exclusively) 
with good sausage and music. Sevdah [lover's longing] and merak 
[lover's sadness], which are also close to the Serbian spirit 
and mentality, but that falls short. 
  [Banjac] What is that other dimension of Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] Cosmopolitanism, it is inherent here, there is a 
cultural polyvalence here which gave rise to a historic quality 
which people there are not aware of. At the same time, suddenly 
faced with am opponent they could not defeat with tanks, they 
were astonished. Faced with an opponent who defends himself with 
his spirit, his intelligence, his ability to represent himself 
and find friends. They are confused in the face of those facts. 
Today all doors are open to Bosnia (but look at Serbia and 
Belgrade, which a decade ago was on the way to becoming a 
regional center and developing, and now it is imploding). We are 
received and respected by everyone. In world capitals I meet 
hundreds of intellectuals from Serbia, young men and women who 
are melting away in a kind of bitterness, in some kind of 
unproductive nihilism, in the belief that the best years of 
their lives have been taken from them. Because of an archaic 
view of the world in which blood and violence to territory take 
preference over much more important things. As though we came 
out of the cave yesterday. 
  [Banjac] Nationality is an obsession of many people at the 
moment? 
  [Silajdzic] Yes, but that is not clear to me. People are 
born 
Serbs or Bosnian Muslims without doing anything about it. If 
they do not go beyond that, if they do not add any values above 
that, this means that they have wasted their lives. Another 
problem is that many are aware of this and want to add some 
meaning, some value per se, to that flight of theirs as a Serb, 
as a Croat, or as a Bosnian Muslim. By the very fact that I am a 
Serb, there is nothing more in life that I need. Or possibly the 
murder of non-Serbs in order to prove oneself as a Serb. Where 
is the logic here, the sense of the future? This has never been 
altogether clear to me. Second, conquering territory as Bosnia 
was conquered after an archaic model -- the lobbing of steel 
into cities -- makes no sense at all today. 
  [Banjac] Who has had what part in destroying Bosnia? 
  [Silajdzic] On the territory controlled by Karadzic's Serbs 
there is no longer a single mosque (they have been keeping 
livestock in them, destroying them, some they have used as 
parking lots), all the way from Foca to Banja Luka; on the 
territory under control of the government and the Army of Bosnia 
and Herzegovina the churches are not being demolished. You have 
seen for yourself that the other day we repaired the Holy 
Transfiguration Church in New Sarajevo, which the Serbian forces 
had destroyed from the hills. The money was furnished by the 
government. 
  [Banjac] The horrible institution of the camp has also been 
revived in the Bosnian war.... 
  [Silajdzic] Manjaca and Omarska are Treblinka and Auschwitz 
in our eyes. I have talked with the raped women -- they were 
raped by men from Serbia. We held about 40 people in Tarcin, 
prisoners of war from Karadzic's military units near Sarajevo. 
(In Kula the Serbs are holding Bosnians, 22 people were taken 
out from there and murdered in the woods near Rudo. They were 
natives of Doboj.) As far as Tarcin is concerned, there has been 
a great deal of manipulation with the break into the prison, but 
the entire truth is that recently a group of refugees from 
Gorazde broke into the prison and took away three people. 
  Here in Bosnia there is much from the Stone Age in any case. 
No one knows what is happening to the Bosnian Muslims in 
Prijedor, in Banja Luka. 
  [Banjac] How do you view the Washington agreement? 
  [Silajdzic] The agreement did not come about overnight. It 
was talked about back last year (Izetbegovic, Tudjman, Hrvoje 
Sarinic, Miomir Zuzul, Ivo Komsic, and I), but the United States 
role was decisive. However, there is a big job to be done in the 
field, since quite a few people were caught by surprise. When 
someone asked why the United States is so important, I reply: 
Whenever we have been in a situation of correcting the injustice 
imposed by adoption of the embargo, as was the case, for 
example, with Igman or Gorazde, we call the United States. We 
know that the Russians are backing Serbia, and only a political 
illiterate would fail to seek a balance from the United States. 
  [Banjac] What do you think about President Izetbegovic? 
There 
is talk about certain differences of opinion? 
  [Silajdzic] I think that he is humane, that he tolerates 
differing opinions. That has of course occurred, and as far as 
the two of us are concerned, we resolve those things directly 
and openly. From him I am learning patience, which I otherwise 
lack in my approach from a reasonable and tolerant viewpoint. 
This is a man who has given his all in the struggle for Bosnia 
and Herzegovina. He is not a conventional politician. In a way 
Bosnia is identified outside, in the eyes of the world, with my 
insignificance. There is no difference in how we see Bosnia. To 
be sure, a few people have obviously been trying to rig some 
kind of disagreements between us and to bring me artificially 
into confrontation with the president, by spreading stories and 
by lobbying. This is done by people who have time on their 
hands, and none of it has to do with the future and the building 
of this state. 
<H5>  [Box, p 5] </H5>
<H5>  If Need Be, We Will Defend Ourselves for Decades </H5>
  [Banjac] What is the future of Bosnia and of the Serbs in 
the 
part you have been fighting and striving for? 
  [Silajdzic] As far as we are concerned, Bosnia remains 
within 
its international borders. There are no tanks or fascists to 
keep us from that. If need be, we will defend ourselves for 
decades. As far as the Serbs are concerned, those are with us 
are not in dispute. As for the others, there are Serbs, as far 
as I know, from Banja Luka to Pale. I hope that they will find 
sufficient strength to reject that fascism that is leading them 
to ruin. Ask them whether Serbs are floating down the Miljacka, 
are Serbian children being thrown to the lions? Call in newsmen 
from Belgrade to come and see what is happening here. The best 
thing you can do to help your people is to be with them here.
