  [Text] The position of our delegation toward the peace 
negotiations in Geneva is evidently increasingly gaining trust 
of the international community. A document was signed at the 
talks in Geneva that have just ended aimed at halting the combat 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- by which a one-month cease-fire will 
come in force throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina as of noon 10 June. 
  In a statement for the B-H PRESS [news agency] Dr. Ejup 
Ganic, head of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation and vice 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, emphasized that 
the delegation had accomplished [words indistinct] set by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly. We have secured the withdrawal of 
Karadzic's military formations from the 3-km zone around Gorazde 
and afterward an agreement on cessation of combat activities for 
the duration of one month. In this way the aggressor will be 
forced to negotiate a political solution to the clashes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dr. Ganic believes. Karadzic tried to 
accomplish a total cease-fire for the duration of at least four 
months in Geneva, which would, on the ground, freeze the 
existing situation and practically mean the recognition of the 
aggressor's conquests. 
  The agreement reached in Geneva is interpreted by the 
international media as a complete success for the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina diplomacy. Our delegation has left open the 
option of extending the cease-fire if the negotiating process 
about the political solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis 
shows [word indistinct] progress, but rejected meeting the 
aggressor's side in Geneva directly. The talks were carried out 
with the mediation of UN representatives.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 9 Jun (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces 
violated the cease-fire on the Sarajevo front last night by 
opening sniper fire on Serbian defense lines, wounding one 
civilian and one Serbian soldier, the information center of the 
Sarajevo-Romanija corps announced this morning. [passage omitted] 
  Last night Serbian reconaissance units sighted a column of 
vehicles moving along the Mt. Igman-Hrasnica road. It is said 
that the vehicles were transporting military equipment for the 
Muslim army, with the tacit approval of the UN Protection Force.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic and Nihad Salihovic] </F>
  [Text] Last night, the chetniks on the Brcko front 
received news of the cease-fire agreement that is supposed to go 
into effect on the Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts at 1200 tomorrow, 
by launching fierce attacks on the defense lines of the free 
Brcko territory. At 2130, a strong 
artillery-reconnaissance-subversive-terrorist group [as heard] 
tried to breach the Brcko defense lines in the Vranovaca region. 
The defenders responded fiercely and the fighting flared up. 
The aggressor ended up with the short end of the stick. 
  After being defeated and suffering losses, the chetniks 
attacked the entire region of Vranovaca from the direction of 
Cadjavac with 82-mm mortars. The final outcome of the fighting 
in Vranovaca is that the (?situation) remained unchanged. 
Between 2000 and 2200, the aggressor attacked the neighboring 
village of Bodariste with 60 and 82-mm mortars from the 
direction of (?Delimir Ravno). During the two-hour artillery 
attack, the enemy fired several dozen shells, but apart from 
destroying more civilian residences, no military successes were 
scored. 
  Overnight, the chetniks intermittently shelled the Zukici 
area with 82-mm mortars from the direction of Sekulici and 
anti-aircraft guns in Lipovac. The aggressor did not accomplish 
his aims on this part of the front either. The defense lines of 
the free Brcko territory are safe and under the full control of 
the fighters of the 108th Motorized Brigade, the 108th Infantry 
Brigade, and units from other contingents. During the agreed 
cease-fire, there are many reasons to remain alert.

  [Text] The reputation of the UN forces engaged in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has plummeted to its lowest level due 
to their incompetence, [word indistinct], and powerlessness to 
stop the aggressor, will be increasingly more difficult to mend, 
among other things, also because of the presenting of numerous 
unsubstantiated justifications for the United Nations' passivity 
on the ground in their addresses to the public, a statement by 
the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says. 
  The 1st Corps points at, conditionally speaking, two 
deceptions of the international public committed by UN spokesman 
Major Rob Annink at a press conference. He tried to justify the 
aggressor's attacks on the defense lines of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the region of Breza, Vares, and 
Ilijas by the fact that neither the Bosnian nor the Serbian side 
would allow them access to the critical areas and thus their 
observers could only register explosions but could determine the 
place from which projectiles had been fired. At the news 
conference, Major Annink did not present the true reasons for 
the lack of engagement by the UN forces. The true reason is 
that the Chetniks do not allow the UN members to move along the 
Temizovac-(?Trebnje) route, precisely because of the constant 
offensives that they have been undertaking in this region. The 
members of the Canadian Battalion justify their not going into 
the field with the fact that the zone that they are supposed to 
supervise is the responsibility of the French Battalion, which 
has its headquarters in Sarajevo. 
  Because of such misinformation of the international public 
and the open siding with the aggressor, the soldiers and the 
officers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the territories of 
Breza, Ilijas, and Vares favor Major Annink being proclaimed 
persona non grata and being denied hospitality in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement by the Information Service of 
the 1st Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says.

  [Text] Warsaw, 9 Jun--The Sejm today adopted a resolution 
urging the government to restrict the so-called negative list, 
concerning the export of weapons and military equipment, to 
countries covered by the UN embargo. The issue was discussed at 
the previous Sejm session, but no decision was made then due to 
the lack of a quorum. 
  The negative list is secret and includes countries to which 
the sale of weapons by the Polish arms industry has been banned.

  [Text] [Announcer Malgorzata Sienkiewicz] Lech Walesa has 
accused the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] of breaking an 
agreement reached during their meeting with Walesa at the Sejm. 
This refers to the appointment of deputy ministers in the 
so-called presidential ministries. In Walesa's opinion, 
nominations should be given out after the reorganization of the 
ministries. 
  [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] Several days after the 
president's meeting with the SLD parliamentary floor group, 
Danuta Waniek became deputy minister of national defense and 
Zbigniew Sobotka became deputy minister of internal affairs. 
  [Begin recording] [Walesa] First, there was supposed to be 
the organization, and the people were to come in afterward. 
First, the structural reorganization plan, as Olechowski 
proposed, and only then the deputy ministers. As we know, the 
deputy ministers have already been appointed in both ministries. 
  [SLD Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski] Well, I think, as is 
often the case, that the president's statement has been 
distorted. The president certainly did not mean that. [end 
recording] 
  [Nomejko] In Borowski's opinion, during the now famous 
meeting, the matter was agreed upon in two areas. The first was 
the coalition's participation in the presidential ministries, 
which, according to the SLD deputy chairman, cannot be 
questioned. The second was the reorganization of the 
ministries, consisting of somebody coming into one of the top 
posts in a ministry on his merits, somebody not connected to a 
political grouping, who would not leave along with the 
government in power. The minister of foreign affairs has 
prepared a new statute and sent it to the Council of Ministers 
for approval. 
  [Begin Borowski recording] In the other two ministries, the 
ministers have to introduce such drafts because these are the 
statutes of their ministries, to put it briefly. So, it is hard 
to speak of a particular role of the SLD here. We support the 
introduction of such drafts by these ministers, and this should 
happen as quickly as possible. [end recording] 
  [Nomejko] According to press reports, there is a conflict 
between the Polish Peasant Party and Foreign Minister Olechowski 
over the reform of his ministry, which may lead to the head of 
the Foreign Ministry handing in his resignation. 
  [Begin recording] [Michal Strak, head of the Office of the 
Council of Ministers] The press, not for the first time and 
probably not for the last, is not briefed very well on what is 
happening inside the government, on what the prime minister is 
doing, and on what I am doing. So we are dealing with yet 
another press fact. They are concerned to show a lack of 
cohesion again, another struggle at the top--which does not 
exist, of course. 
  [Unidentified correspondent, addressing Foreign Minister 
Olechowski] Is there a danger of your resigning? 
  [Olechowski] Only if you force me to. [end recording] 
  [Nomejko] In a week's time, the government will tackle the 
comprehensive reform of the central administration along with 
with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statute. After its likely 
approval, Marek Siwiec will become deputy foreign minister.

<F P=106> [Interview with Wlodzimierz Lecki, voivoda of Poznan, by </F>
correspondents Leszek Luczak and Roman Zielinski; place and date 
not given] 
  [Excerpts] [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Self-government activists 
complain that the voivodas are not interested in representing 
their positions to the central authorities, that they function 
exclusively as government representatives.... 
  [Lecki] Indeed, this does present a rather difficult 
problem. A voivoda cannot see himself as a representative of 
local self-government structures. Local self-government has its 
own representative bodies. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] But surely a voivoda can support in 
Warsaw the recommendations formulated by self-government 
activists? 
[Lecki] There are local self-government assemblies in 
voivodships that were set up especially to represent regional 
interests. But the crux of the problem is elsewhere. To what 
extent should a voivoda represent the interests of the region 
and to what extent those of the state? By definition, most 
voivodas hail from the regions in which they hold their office. 
They are local patriots who have the interests of their 
voivodships at heart. It is the same with me. For example, I 
constantly fight for allocation of higher outlays for 
investments in the local roads network. The Poznan-Pniewy 
highway is already overloaded to the limits of its 
possibilities. Decisions involving its modernization are 
currently in the balance. I would very much like to be able to 
help in this particular matter, among others. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Do you have much influence? 
  [Lecki] All I can do is formulate my recommendations. For 
example, a large new residential estate recently developed in 
Swarzedz is linked by a new road to Highway 2 by a highly 
dangerous junction, on which many traffic accidents have already 
been recorded. I have made several written representations in 
this matter, and they were successful. During this year, the 
dangerous road junction will be redesigned and reconstructed as 
a so-called level crossing. The reconstruction will cost 30 
billion zlotys [Z]. I had asked for a split-level crossing, but 
that would have cost Z100 billion, which would be beyond our 
budget's capacities. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] You take part in the Council of Ministers 
sessions as a consultant. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which belong to the 
government coalition, claim with increasing insistence that they 
have differing visions of the planned state administrative 
reform. Where do you stand with reference to these differing 
positions? 
  [Lecki] During the government sessions, no differences in 
the proposed ways of state administration are apparent between 
the ministers hailing from the SLD and those representing the 
PSL. The Council of Ministers sessions are conducted in a very 
open manner, and I believe that the ministers who participate in 
them do say what they think. We often have polemical arguments, 
even between ministers from the same political group. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] So do members of the Waldemar Pawlak 
Cabinet want decentralization, or are they not interested in it? 
  [Lecki] They do want it. The only thing is that they are 
after a different option. The Suchocka government wanted to 
reform our state administration from the bottom up. To begin 
with, they prepared the so-called pilot program, which has 
already been implemented. The next stage was supposed to be the 
introduction of the new district scheme. But Minister Michal 
Strak, head of the Council of Ministers Office, intends to 
reform the state administration starting from the top. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Which of these concepts was more to 
your liking? 
  [Lecki] I would have preferred a reform starting from the 
bottom structures. The majority of local self-government bodies 
in our voivodship carried out their program very rationally, 
according to what they should and what they could do. The 
creation of districts will automatically present us with larger 
self-government structures, whereas Poznan Voivodship has both 
small and large parishes: The smallest one has 3,000 residents 
and the largest 600,000. If the district project does go 
through, the local authorities would have all of the specialist 
services at their disposal--for example, the health service, the 
land-surveying services, housing construction, education, and so 
on. I believe that such a system would function most 
efficiently. My position on this subject is influenced by my 
knowledge of the functioning of the district system before the 
war. In our part of the country, they proved to be very 
effective indeed. Even after the war, despite the restrictions 
of the totalitarian system, the district scheme worked well, 
creating a sense of local patriotism and commitment. On the 
other hand, I am well aware that, in Poland's eastern regions, 
they are not particularly keen to see the introduction of the 
district system. So the government really finds itself between 
a rock and a hard place. [passage omitted] 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Minister Strak insists that local 
self-government works well only in small parishes and in 
residential estates. Anything larger is not genuine local 
self-government. According to him, the problem is that 
small-scale local self-government serves mainly to promote the 
interests of small local elite groups and individual 
self-government activists. 
  [Lecki] I suspect that there is some reason for Minister 
Strak's claims because there is indeed a group of 
self-government activists who promote the thesis of the 
inevitability of conflict between government and local 
administration. Personally, I believe that this thesis is 
incorrect. From the example of my own voivodship, I can state 
that, in the case of a decided majority of local self-government 
structures, there is no conflict at all. At the present moment, 
a political conflict has superimposed itself, as it were, on the 
apparent conflict between the central and local administration, 
the supposed existence of which has been postulated by certain 
politicians. The government is of a left-wing persuasion, 
whereas local self-government structures are largely represented 
by people who cherish right-wing views. I remember a number of 
sessions of our local self-government structures at which Prime 
Minister Suchocka was present. You could always count on 
spirited argument and debate during those meetings. On the 
other hand, the debates that took place recently at the Arena 
Hall were, in my opinion, below certain adopted parliamentary 
standards. Such levels of aggression, encouraged from two 
sides, are harmful also for the future of local self-government 
structures. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How did your cooperation with the 
Voivodship Assembly go? 
  [Lecki] That was during the first term of office of the 
newly revived local self-government structures and, naturally, 
also the first term of office of the Self-Government Assembly. 
The assembly's range of competence was rather unclear and that 
was why, especially during the first stage of our cooperation, 
certain controversial issues arose. But, by the end of their 
first term of office, the common plane of cooperation between 
the voivoda and the Self-Government Assembly became much better 
defined and more clear. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] What have you done to prevent the 
possibility of corruption in the Voivodship Office? 
  [Lecki] We have our own monitoring system. We treat all 
information, including even anonymous messages, most seriously. 
I must stress that, over the past four years, I received only 
one message informing me that an official in our office had 
taken a bribe. In any case, it was such a ridiculously small 
sum of money that it reminded me of a prewar joke: "You must be 
especially careful not to offend a civil servant with a bribe 
that is too low to match his position." 
  The Planning Department is the most frequent ground for 
leveling accusations of corruption against our officials. This 
is because that department usually has to decide in contentious 
cases, where the losers usually then accuse the officials 
involved of dishonestly and corruption. On the other hand, 
privatization is protected with such watertight regulations that 
practically no scope for corruption is left. [passage omitted] 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How much do your officials earn? 
  [Lecki] I pay salaries of Z7-8 million gross to my 
directors. Other employees get much: The average salary is 
about Z4 million. 
  [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Where is the limit of your loyalty as a 
government official? 
  [Lecki] I would like to serve as voivoda for as long as I 
can personally endorse the government's policy. The policy 
tenets of Prime Minister Pawlak's government are not, on the 
whole, much different from those of Prime Minister Suchocka's 
government. There are, of course, certain subtle differences, 
but they concern details. As for privatization, the principles 
of its implementation are no different from those mapped out by 
Minister Lewandowski. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by "E.Cz.": "CBOS on Politicians and Moods in May; </F>
Kuron, Pawlak, and Religa Are Leading"] 
  [Text] According to the Public Opinion Research 
Center [CBOS], Jacek Kuron, Waldemar Pawlak, and Zbigniew Religa 
continue to be the most popular politicians. Social moods did 
not change substantially in May. Society assesses its financial 
living conditions better than it did in April. 
<H5>  SLD Politicians Less Popular </H5>
  Since March, confidence in Zbigniew Religa (chairman of the 
Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms), deteriorated the most. 
This can be explained by society slowly understanding the 
change in Religa's role from an excellent heart surgeon to a 
politician. Confidence in three politicians of the Democratic 
Left Alliance [SLD] also went down in May: Wlodzimierz 
Cimoszewicz (by 7 points), Leszek Miller and Aleksander 
Kwasniewski (by 4 points each). A lack of confidence in trade 
union leaders also increased: Ewa Spychalska, who was opposed 
to the strikes (by 6 points), and Marian Krzaklewski, the leader 
of the recent strikes (by 4 points.) Slight increases in social 
confidence were reported for Leszek Moczulski, Jaroslaw 
Kaczynski (he continues to be distrusted the most), and Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek. 
<H5>  Better Moods on Living Conditions </H5>
  After the April-May strikes, price rises on some merchandise 
and services, and a slight increase in salaries, social moods 
did not change significantly in May. Compared with April, 
slightly more people think that the situation in the country is 
heading in the right direction. Managerial cadres and private 
entrepreneurs have the best views on the situation, and 
unskilled laborers and farmers the worst. Close to 60 percent 
of those polled have a negative assessment of the economic 
situation (only 6 percent think it is good), while farmers have 
the most negative views in that regard. Skilled laborers, 
farmers, managerial cadres, and entrepreneurs are the most 
critical concerning the country's political situation. 
  Compared with April, the respondents' own standard of living 
(and of their closest family members) is perceived as better (by 
4 points), as well as their material living conditions (by 6 
points). Managerial cadres, nonmanual laborers, and private 
entrepreneurs are most satisfied with their financial standing, 
while farmers and unskilled laborers are the least satisfied. 
The slight increase in optimism levels is probably linked to an 
improvement in the overall economic situation and to a salary 
increase that was a result of the lifting of the popiwek 
[enterprise tax on above-normative pay]. 
  The CBOS respondents say that, over the next year, the 
political, economic, and family situations will not change. But 
what also happened was that the percentage of people convinced 
that the country's general situation will deteriorate decreased 
slightly. Managerial cadres are the most optimistic when it 
comes to forecasting the economic situation. 
  The CBOS poll on the popularity of politicians was conducted 
between 7 and 10 May, using a 1,219-person representative random 
sampling of the country's adult residents. The one on social 
moods was conducted between 19 and 23 May, using a 1,209-person 
representative random sampling of the country's adult residents.

<F P=106> [Article compiled by Sabina Augustynowicz: "The Securities </F>
Commission Has Been in Operation for Three Years Now; We Are 
Waiting for Institutional Investors"] 
  [Text] The Securities Commission [Komisja Papierow 
Wartosciowych, KPW] has just ended its third year of existence. 
KPW Chief Leslaw Paga, while proposing a toast, said that one 
does not drink to the health of children, but one can make an 
exception in order for the stock market to continue to develop 
as successfully as it has thus far. 
  According to many people associated with the stock market in 
various ways, the capital market in Poland has been developing 
correctly. That does not mean, of course, that no changes are 
needed that would guarantee the market's correct development. 
  Professor Grzegorz Domanski, chief of the Council of 
the Securities Stock Market: The Polish capital market has 
been developing in the same way as a majority of institutions of 
the market economy in our country. There is no reason for the 
market to deviate from that general pattern. After all, the 
capital market is an integral part of the entire economic 
system, so it progresses along with the system. The rate of 
reforms we have been witnessing in the entire economy is 
directly reflected in the rate of changes in the capital market 
and also in its development. Despite being a very young market, 
it has already undergone changes. First, it has undergone a 
substantial calming down, and anyone who influences its 
regulatory shape and feels morally responsible is very happy 
about it. Currently, we are counting very much on two things: a 
speeding up of the development of brokerage houses that have 
clearly been becoming a bottleneck in the stock market's 
development, and, second, we want our securities market to stop 
being a market for individual investors and petty money grubbers 
and to become, instead, a market of institutional investors. We 
are already witnessing some symptoms of the changes. So, if we 
manage to invite institutional investors into the game, and if 
we manage to strengthen brokerage houses, we have a very bright 
future ahead of us. 
  Andrzej Celinski of the Freedom Union: I am not a 
professional. I am just a politician who is interested in 
economics. From my nonprofessional standpoint, the capital 
market in Poland has been developing correctly, although perhaps 
somewhat too cautiously. Perhaps the development of the Warsaw 
Stock Market does not meet expectations or needs. Besides, 
institutions dealing with the capital market have a too limited 
array of services. In Poland, not only is the stock market too 
"thin" and small, with new companies entering it too slowly, but 
we also do not have new economic institutions with the necessary 
infrastructure for development of the capital market--for 
instance, property rights insurance. It is an institution that 
is known to every outside investor. But those investors do not 
find it here in Poland. This makes the investment processes 
very difficult, especially those that require changes in the 
ownership of, for instance, land or industrial premises. In my 
view, another issue is the array of offers of different 
financial services, which continues to be limited. Practically 
speaking, there are no venture capital [preceding two words in 
English] organizations in Poland--that is, with capital that 
requires the kind of investors using primarily their own ideas, 
unique expertise, and knowledge, and looking for deep gaps in 
the market as the basis. Countries that are developing at a 
fast rate--and Poland is definitely becoming such a country--and 
that are quickly changing ownership structures need offers going 
beyond the traditional offer of bank credit as a necessary 
ingredient for development of young entrepreneurship. Generally 
speaking, the stock market is developing a bit too slowly, but 
we understand the position of those who guard it against 
misfortune. 
  Stock Market Chairman Wieslaw Rozlucki: It is 
difficult to be my own judge, but I think the first three years 
were good. We managed to avoid major mistakes. Some things are 
just beyond our control. The stock market's management cannot 
control the market itself or prices that either rise or fall too 
quickly. These issues are beyond our capabilities. I think the 
fundamental assumptions stood their test. In the beginning, 
there was nothing like a major involvement of interests and 
money that currently determine the shares' value. I am afraid 
that, unfortunately, the next three years will not be as good in 
the sense of avoiding conflicts or settling problems 
professionally. Of course, there are a few things that should be 
changed. We are waiting for institutional investors, better 
advisers, and better services provided to our customers. In my 
view, company analysis, fundamental analysis, and investment 
counseling remain the bottlenecks. But, as everybody can see, 
those bottlenecks keep changing every few months, followed by 
new problems that we try to overcome, and, in this way, the 
market is gradually developing.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Wojciech Okonski, deputy minister </F>
of foreign economic cooperation, by Krzysztof Krauss; place and 
date not given: "Polish Trade with Russia; Different Time, 
Different Reality"] 
  [Text] [Krauss] If our position on the Russian market 
were the same today as it was on the Soviet market in 1990, the 
value of the sale of Polish merchandise to Russia would amount 
to more than $2 billion. However, it is a mere $700 million. 
  [Okonski] The population of the Soviet Union [SU] was almost 
290 million people; the population of Russia is approximately 
150 million. In line with official data, SU's imports in 1990 
totalled $120 billion; Russia's imports in 1992 were 
approximately $35 billion and, in 1993, dropped by another 27 
percent. By limiting imports (including imports from Poland), 
Russia, undergoing enormous economic difficulties, is trying to 
protect its active balance of the turnover. It is trying to find 
money to pay off its foreign debt, which is almost twice as 
large as Poland's ($82 billion). 
  Until 1990, our trade was conducted in unreal 
money--transfer 
rubles. There was not much that could be bought for this 
currency, and, if anything, it was only used in bilateral trade. 
Trade was regulated not so much through commercial contracts 
but through orders issued by the "center." Prices were also 
shaped administratively to a considerable degree. The 
coincidence of all of these circumstances: The economic crisis 
in Russia and the recession in our country, lasting until 1992, 
new world-level prices, the necessity for real foreign currency 
for purchases simply had to affect the trade in some way. In 
relations with some other countries of the former Council for 
Mutual Economic Assistance [CEMA], the breakdown was even deeper. 
  We must also remember what constituted most of our exports 
to 
SU. We sold mainly machines and devices. The demand for them has 
in recent years considerably decreased in Russia. 
  [Krauss] There is no chance, then, to increase our exports 
to Russia in the near future? The West has made a fierce attack 
on the Russian market, with success, if we take a closer look at 
the geographic structure of Russia's purchases. As recently as 
1990, there was only one Western state among the five greatest 
trade partners of Russia: Germany. The leading five also 
included Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Now (in 
1992), the first five positions are occupied by Germany, Italy, 
China, the United States, and France. There is no state 
belonging to the former CEMA. 
  [Okonski] Russia is a market of huge possibilities; it 
attracts the attention of all exporters. With the potential of 
this country, it is to be expected, in the general opinion of 
experts, that the economic collapse will eventually be stopped, 
and, in a few years, production growth will begin once again. 
This will increase the demand for imports and increase export 
capabilities. At that time, those partners of Russia who are 
already in that market will have a chance to develop their 
businesses quite significantly. It will be a chance that is 
offered to a few markets in the world. Our ambition is not to 
increase our exports to the Russian market. We would like to 
see that the import savings do not affect the purchases made in 
our country. This is our task in the near future. 
  In other words, we would like to maintain exports to Russia 
on the same level we have so far; we would not like to lose what 
we already have. 
  [Krauss] What can we offer Russia? In what areas can we be 
competitive compared to other partners, who are also aspiring to 
maintain and increase their presence on this market? 
  [Okonski] Traditionally, the goods that are well known on 
the Russian market and that have a good name are food, highly 
processed consumer goods such as household appliances, clothing, 
fabric, shoes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and others. However, 
this does not exhaust our export capabilities. It must be 
remembered that we sent huge amounts of investment equipment to 
the former Soviet market. Polish equipment was used in the 
construction of hundreds of factories and other production 
objects. A large number of them were built in Russia. What is 
needed is service and spare parts. It will also be necessary to 
modernize many of these: metallurgical enterprises, 
sulfur-processing enterprises, mines with an element that is 
very important in the extraction industry--the devices ensuring 
industrial safety, food-processing enterprises, power plants, 
etc. If we do not let others push us out, this may become the 
springboard for developing investment exports once again. 
Documents submitted to the Economic Committee of the Council of 
Ministers, which has approved them, envision increasing exports 
in this direction by 30 percent by 1997. If we are consistent, 
it will be quite possible to put this plan into effect. 
  Regarding construction of new objects, the situation is more 
complex. We may be competitive, but Russia must be able to 
afford to embark on such investment undertakings. For the time 
being, the scope of new investment is very limited. However, 
there are announcements that are very promising to our 
exporters. I am thinking primarily about the construction of a 
new natural gas pipeline to Western Europe, part of which--over 
500 kilometers--will pass through Poland. Several thousand 
kilometers of the pipeline will go through Russia. This may be 
a great "labor front" for us, an opportunity to obtain 
attractive orders, just like the planned construction of super 
highways. Polish road-construction machines are of an entirely 
different technology generation in comparison with what we had 
10 years ago. Many of them are already in use in East Asia 
under American names, and they are proving themselves quite 
well. We really are not worse than the machine suppliers from 
Germany, Japan, and other states. 
  [Krauss] However, investment export is rarely conducted in 
cash; it needs to be supported with credit. Where are the banks 
in Poland that could afford to conduct operations involving such 
huge capital? 
  [Okonski] There already are examples of forming consortia 
for the service of very large exports contracts. For the time 
being, they do not pertain to the Russian market. They concern 
the Chinese Consortium of Polish banks, of course, with 
guarantees of the Bank of China--it opened a credit line of 
approximately $400 million. However, Russia is currently a 
particularly high risk market, and, for the time being, this 
limits the possibility of employing such solutions and also of 
employing in Russia the resources of the Exports Credits 
Insurance Corporation (insurance on the political risk, 
catastrophes, and other difficult-to-predict events), which has 
been well capitalized recently. 
  [Krauss] The recently announced report of the Central 
Planning Administration, entitled "The Economic Situation of 
Poland in 1993 Compared to Other Countries," stresses, among 
other things, that one of the unsatisfactory results of foreign 
trade in the countries of our region is the weakness of 
"systemic and institutional support of exports." 
  [Okonski] We are trying to support the exports to the 
difficult Russian market. We have submitted to the Russian 
party a proposal of signing long-term commercial contracts 
concerning merchandise that is important to both states from a 
strategic standpoint: raw materials for Poland (oil, natural 
gas, metals), and for Russia pharmaceuticals, food, and 
equipment for its key investments. We have already received 
verbal support and are now awaiting a reply. A "governmental" 
instrument is also annual commercial protocols that ensure the 
maintenance of the minimum level of turnover in the main groups 
of commodities (such a protocol concerning 1992 proved itself; 
now we want to conclude appropriate protocols for 1994 and 
1995), a commercial protocol on the exchange of special 
equipment (spare parts for military equipment, which both armies 
will need for a long time--totaling tens of millions of U.S. 
dollars), and an agreement on military and technological 
cooperation. 
  Cooperation in the armament industries is not at all a 
closed 
chapter. We witnessed a commercialization of the best 
technologies, so the cooperation of experts of special 
industries may be very useful. They might cooperate in the area 
of modernization of our armies and in exporting equipment to 
third markets. Another area of this cooperation might include 
the adjustment of production capacities in these industries, 
which are too high, to civilian needs. 
  [Krauss] You failed to include the settlement of old debts 
on the list of government activities. 
  [Okonski] This will not happen overnight. It is a very 
complex issue, and we should leave it to specialists. The past 
cannot block our present relations. We are concentrating 
primarily on what can be done to increase the exchange, to 
increase its extent and intensity. I have discussed government 
initiatives that are supposed to make it easier for exporters to 
get access to the Russian market. However, the administration 
also wants to support the activities of "economic entities" and 
their associations (economic chambers, business clubs, regional 
associations, and others), activities that are supposed to help 
those companies remain on the Russian market. For example, this 
year our ministry has $10 million to finance various promotional 
initiatives: participation in exhibitions and fairs, economic 
missions, seminars. However, at least half of the money needed 
for these activities must be paid by the companies themselves. 
We merely partially subsidize such initiatives--if they are 
reasonable and economically well-founded. Our offices of 
commercial advisers are also at the disposal of entrepreneurs: 
They provide information, contacts, etc. 
  [Krauss] And the effect of these activities is a surplus in 
the economic turnover with Russia? 
  [Okonski] We are not counting on a surplus, even though it 
would be good to decrease the present deficit, which amounts to 
approximately $600-700 million a year. What is important is 
that Russia can supply us with many fundamental materials (oil, 
natural gas, etc.) at competitive prices and on favorable terms. 
Even though we do not want to recreate the former full 
dependence, commercial criteria must be taken into account. 
  We would like to cover essential expenditures by means of 
our 
exports to a maximum degree. The limit, however, would be 
profitability of exports. Another factor that encourages 
seeking markets for our goods in Russia is that exports increase 
the number of workplaces, which is quite significant for a 
country with almost 3 million unemployed people. Even if we do 
not achieve any surpluses of foreign currencies in our trade 
with Russia, the employment effect is certainly of some 
economic-social importance. 
  [Krauss] Thank you for the interview.

<F P=106> [Article by Lise Tajik: "Denmark Among Biggest Investors in </F>
Poland"] 
  [Text] Danish investments in Poland have exploded. Denmark 
is among Poland's largest foreign investors. 
  Since the collapse of the communist system, the largest 
Danish firms have invested over $60 million--about 400 million 
kroner--in Poland, meaning that Denmark is in 11th place in the 
ranking list of investing countries in that country, according 
to the newsletter POLAND. 
  Denmark now accounts for 1.7 percent of total foreign 
investments in Poland, and, at the same time, moved up five 
places on the list since last August, when Danish investments 
were registered at only just over 50 million kroner. 
  The actual amount is presumably much greater because many 
small and medium-size business investments are not included in 
the calculation. 
  The survey covers only those foreign firms that have 
invested 
at least $1 million in the country. Ranked according to the 
number of firms with investments amounting to over $1 million, 
Denmark is in seventh place. 
  The United States, Italy, and Germany top the list, while 
Sweden, with $71 million, and Norway, with $44 million, occupy 
the 10th and 13th places, respectively. 
  Over 130 Danish firms either have subsidiaries, production 
activities, or sales offices, or have gone into joint ventures 
in Poland. 
  Fifty Danish companies are going to take part two weeks from 
now in the European Union's company contact fairs, 
Europartenariat Polska, in Gdansk.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy by Andrzej </F>
Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of 
Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] I have read in today's papers that 
you participated in a National Defense Committee [KOK] meeting 
and that this meeting, devoted to the subordination of the chief 
of the General Staff, was very tense. 
  [Oleksy] This was one of the topics discussed, and it 
concerned the specific decision examined by the Council of 
Ministers, which, at the president's request, was sent back to 
KOK for reexamination. But this is one element of the whole 
package of principles related to the defense policies of the 
state and its security. This is one big document that was also 
examined by the Council of Ministers, and it will be discussed 
by the Sejm as well. 
  [Woyciechowski] What does it mean that KOK's meeting was 
tense? What happened there that was so tense? 
  [Oleksy] I did not have that kind of impression. These were 
merely media reports. However, there were indeed different 
opinions, and not only about the issue of subordination in the 
Armed Forces, which was central to the meeting. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is this about who should nominate the 
supreme chief--the president, the government, or the Sejm? 
  [Oleksy] No, because Article 35 of the Constitution 
specifies 
who has the power to nominate the chief of General Staff, his 
deputies, and military district commanders. So there are no 
ambiguities here, and there can never be any. At issue is to 
what extent the civilian control over the Army--something that 
is determined by the principles of Polish democracy and that of 
other countries and is NATO's requirement for countries that 
cooperate with it--so, to what extent this civilian control 
should mean the degree of direct leadership executed by the 
defense minister over the Army. 
  [Woyciechowski] By the civilian minister? 
  [Oleksy] Yes, the civilian minister, because this is 
precisely what is at issue. Until now, the chief of General 
Staff has been answerable to the defense minister. So it is the 
leadership of the president over the Armed Forces that is 
executed through the defense minister. 
  [Woyciechowski] In other words, the civilian tells a general 
which way to shoot, and the general shoots? 
  [Oleksy] I do not think this was the problem. The minister 
is a supervisor of the whole thing. He does not interfere, I 
believe, with specific matters related to the everyday operation 
of the military but ensures conditions for its functioning, 
combat readiness, equipment, etc. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is it true that this is where opinions of 
the 
defense minister, who is a general, and the president differ? 
  [Oleksy] I see this in a broader perspective. I had the 
impression that the president sought direct control over the 
General Staff, whose chief, his deputies, and military district 
commanders are appointed by the president himself. However, the 
deputies and military district commanders are appointed at the 
request of the defense minister. So I think he wants that done 
by the chief of General Staff. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us now talk about another 
Belweder-controlled minister, the interior affairs minister. Do 
you think the draft laws on police will be passed? 
  [Oleksy] They will definitely be heatedly and 
controversially 
debated. These are new solutions, new in Polish law. The key 
witness and controlled purchases are well established parts of 
Western law and an unpracticed novelty in our country--hence, so 
many fears about the way they will be executed, if passed. I 
suspect this will trigger a lot of controversy in the Sejm 
because the commission for administration and interior affairs 
has already frequently discussed that. One should remember that 
those projects were already proposed and then withdrawn. So, 
this is their second attempt. On the other hand, the Interior 
Affairs Ministry rightly demands resolute decisions to counter 
the surge in crime, unlawfulness, and arrogance of the 
underworld. I agree with its arguments. Law must be toughened 
so that citizens feel more secure. They do not feel safe even on 
the streets. The reason may be that the police are very often 
powerless and restrained by the current statute. As a matter of 
fact, they sometimes find themselves in a worse situation than 
the criminal. 
  [Woyciechowski] Actually, a lot of interesting things will 
be 
happening in the Sejm now. For example, the concordat. Will it 
pass, do you think? 
  [Oleksy] Everyone is thinking about it, calculating votes, 
making up proportions, analyzing political declarations by 
various groups. After all, the dispute concerns both politics 
and the substance. This concordat is expected to be examined 
before the break. 
  [Woyciechowski] Which is in June or July? 
  [Oleksy] Which is 1 July, when the Sejm's last meeting will 
be held. 
  [Woyciechowski] So everything will be resolved by that time? 
  [Oleksy] I do not know because this will depend on how the 
motions are worded. The Sejm's Presidium intends to bring up 
the concordat in its first reading. Next, there will surely be 
a different proposal--to reject the document in its current 
reading or to submit it to legislative commissions. I even know 
that there will be proposals demanding the concordat's second 
reading without even submitting it to the commissions. There 
will be a large number of different proposals, and it is going 
to be a tough debate--also in procedural terms. 
  [Woyciechowski] Now, what about abortion? Is the issue of 
abortion going to come back to the Sejm before the elections, as 
part, as it were, of the election campaign? 
  [Oleksy] I think this is no longer possible. The first 
reading has already taken place; the second reading was even 
accompanied by a certain procedural conflict. Let me recall 
that this was not finally accepted; now we would need the report 
of the committee to hold the third reading and the voting. As 
it is known, a number of persons, as well as certain groups are 
demanding an even more detailed substantive analysis by 
specialists. Thus, I do not expect that abortion will be 
discussed before the elections. 
  [Woyciechowski] What will happen if the Sejm decreases the 
severity of this law? If the president does not sign it, the 
law will return to the Sejm. From your high place in the Sejm, 
you can easily see how the deputies vote. Will the Sejm manage 
to force this law with the majority of the votes? 
  [Oleksy] I think that is possible. Right now this issue is 
slightly controversial; some people perceived it as an element 
of the election campaign. After the entire procedure, when it 
can be assumed that the president will not sign this law, I 
expect that it is possible to achieve two-thirds of the votes to 
override the president's veto. 
  [Woyciechowski] What will happen to the National Council of 
Radio and Television [KRRiT] in the Sejm? Will it manage to 
pass through the Sejm successfully? 
  [Oleksy] The committee has already worked on the report; it 
issued a positive opinion on this report. Discussions are 
already under way on whether the report should be accepted, 
whether to take some measures to change the KRRiT. My personal 
view--not the official view of the Sejm speaker--is that any 
attempt to overthrow this council must be approached very 
cautiously. After all, it is not a new establishment in the 
Polish democracy. Despite all of the remarks that can be made 
about it, it is an establishment that has accomplished 
something; it has introduced some new order. This was 
accompanied by some conflicts, which, however, did not appear in 
all of the issues. I also think that the discussion in my club, 
the club of the Democratic Left Alliance, as well as in the 
other clubs will be quite animated. Criticism is justified in 
this case; however, there is the question of whether this 
criticism justifies such a dramatic step as overthrowing the 
council. 
  [Woyciechowski] Yesterday the Sejm Committee actually 
praised KRRiT, but it kept criticizing Walendziak... 
  [Oleksy, interrupting] I can see some inconsistency here... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you watch television and do 
you not like television? 
  [Oleksy] I have my own complaints here as well, as it were. 
However, I do not have the right to voice them in public; we 
have often discussed this. What I want is a more systematic 
approach and a certain balance in the activities of the public 
media. However, I do not think that the entire issue can be 
handled this way--that is, one cannot say that the KRRiT is 
marvelous, but its decisions and its results are bad. This is 
false. They must be looked upon as one. This direction, I 
think... [Oleksy pauses] It will go in the direction of 
criticism of the KRRiT, without any firmness in deciding its 
fate. There will probably be certain suggestions of changes in 
the functioning of the mass media. 
  [Woyciechowski] What was it like in China? Is it true that 
Chinese women are very pretty but have small breasts? 
  [Oleksy] They have breasts of different sizes. Most of 
them are average in size. However, there are also very tall 
Chinese women. Most people in Poland think that they are all 
slanted-eyed midgets. That is not true. In the fashion show in 
Shanghai, there were very tall Chinese girls from the north of 
the country, whom Europe can only envy. Now, China from the 
point of the visit.... [Oleksy pauses] There was a certain 
unpleasant event concerning this visit, which had to do with 
Radio Zet. However, I want to consider it a closed case. Now, 
China is a country that is incredibly friendly to Poland and 
mainly to Poland as a country in Central Europe. It will soon 
become the greatest market in the world. It is a country 
characterized by enormous investment dynamics, by an enormous 
growth rate, which has been going on for many years. It is a 
country that is modernizing, ensuring the basic standard of 
living for 1.2 billion people.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] However, does it want to trade 
with us? 
  [Oleksy] And it wants to trade with us. It wants to do this 
quite frankly. In line with the protocol, my talks with the 
president of the state were supposed to take no more than a 
half-hour; in fact, they finished after an hour and a half. It 
was not a courtesy. What it really was was the expression of 
real cordiality and goodwill. I interpret this visit as a good 
declaration of the Chinese party. We formulated our declaration 
as well. I believe that this must be developed. There are such 
possibilities. We were accompanied by businessmen, entrepreneurs 
of large companies. They made good contacts already during the 
visit. Three new joint-venture companies were set up during the 
visit. As I was told there in China, it is a market where 
everything can be sold. The only requirement is that you must 
want to do it and know how to do it. I think that we should 
follow the example of the powers of the world, which want to be 
there on that market at any cost. They realize the advantages 
that can be gained in trade and investment cooperation with this 
country. It would not be very responsible of us if Poland, for 
one reason or another, which may be quite important but 
certainly incomparable to the possible strategic advantages, 
were to miss the opportunities that are offered by contacts with 
China--a country that is friendly to Poland. 
  [Woyciechowski] The presidential election. What will it look 
like, Mr. Sejm Speaker? 
  [Oleksy] I think my view of it is similar to the views of 
most people in Poland: All of the statements, especially sharp 
statements, and firm announcements are premature. I think there 
is still a lot of time and still.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When will the election really 
be held? Everyone keeps talking about it, but no one knows.... 
  [Oleksy, interrupting] It will be held in October 1995. 
Thus, it is still too early. We still must work on the 
constitution, which should absolutely be adopted before the 
election, so that the election can be held on a new 
constitutional base, so that there is a clear separation of 
powers.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] The constitution has been 
discussed for four years now and we still do not have it. 
  [Oleksy] I will do everything to speed up the work and to 
adopt the constitution in the spring referendum in 1995. 
  [Woyciechowski] The spring referendum in 1995--that is, in 
one year's time. Thank you, Mr. Sejm Speaker, for the interview. 
  [Oleksy] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janusz Grela, head of the National </F>
Employment Office, by correspondent Teresa Kwasniewska; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kwasniewska] How much do we spend on unemployment 
in Poland? 
  [Grela] The estimated figure for this year is 42 trillion 
zlotys [Z]--that is, $2 billion. 
  [Kwasniewska] And how much does it cost for an employment 
office to attend to one unemployed person? 
  [Grela] In 1993 it cost approximately Z400,000--that is, 
just over Z30,000 per month. On average, last year in Poland 
the Employment Fund spent Z11.7 million on each unemployed 
person. To add these costs up, one unemployed person costs 
Poland Z12.1 million a year. It is estimated that this year the 
amount could rise to Z14.5 million. 
  [Kwasniewska] Is this much or little? 
  [Grela] Compared with other countries, these costs are low. 
Among other things, this is related to the national income 
level. On the other hand, we record very low expenditure on 
active forms of combating unemployment. This year 13 percent of 
the total sum allocated to unemployment expenditure will be 
spent on it--and we know that there are countries in which 50 
percent of the available funds are used in this way. 
  [Kwasniewska] We have not yet discussed the other, 
associated costs of unemployment, which are, perhaps, less easy 
to measure and more difficult to evaluate or illustrate in 
statistical terms. Nevertheless, they are extremely 
burdensome.... 
  [Grela] Indeed. They involve the losses and disadvantages 
suffered by society in general as a result of the fact that 3 
million Poles are unemployed. These costs are probably five or 
six times as high as the total value of the financial resources 
at the disposal of the Employment Fund. Professor Kabaj 
estimates that, in 1993, they amounted to Z150-180 trillion. 
These costs affect society at many levels and are the result of 
social pathology, family breakdown, lack of motivation to work, 
restriction of future prospects, and so on. 
  [Kwasniewska] The employment office is the first "contact 
point" for the unemployed. How can its work be made more 
efficient and effective? 
  [Grela] When the funds are insufficient, we must make 
choices and establish a hierarchy of priorities. Consequently, 
we decided to invest in regional rather than voivodship 
employment offices and to allocate the sum of Z17.5 billion for 
their needs. Of course, that sum is far too low when set 
against the existing needs. However, we cannot afford more at 
the present moment. 
  It will also be necessary to reform the very structure of 
the 
employment offices and to get rid of the excessively developed 
system of departments, sections, and so on. I believe that I 
have the moral right to make such decisions. I began with 
myself. When I first assumed this post, I carried out a 
reorganization of the Employment Office's central structures. 
There were more departments here than at the Ministry of Labor 
itself, so we had an unimaginable degree of "managementization" 
(25 percent) and a truly excessive proportion of consultants. 
So I reduced the number of executive management positions 
because they constituted mere organizational decoration and had 
absolutely no justification from the viewpoint of the nature of 
our work here. However, the range and definition of our tasks 
and duties have, of course, remained unchanged. I believe that 
similar changes should be introduced in regional and voivodship 
employment offices. 
  [Kwasniewska] On average, how many unemployed are there 
per employment center officer? 
  [Grela] About 300. However, there is great differentiation 
in the figures here--which is entirely unjustified. This is 
another thing that is causing me much concern. In some 
employment centers, there are on average 170 unemployed per 
officer, and in others more than 400. This means that people 
work harder there for the same salary. Obviously, this requires 
some adjustment. 
  [Kwasniewska] In effect, the employment office has two roles 
to play: economic and social. Which of them is it better 
equipped to play? 
  [Grela] It fulfills its role in the social sphere reasonably 
well. We pay unemployment benefits to those without work, we 
refer them to public works, and so on. However, we must now 
move on to a higher level of activity. That is, we should stop 
talking about the labor market policy and start talking about an 
employment policy. In other words, we must protect existing 
jobs and create new ones. Our first line of action should be to 
guarantee job security. To this end, we should place more 
emphasis on developing our employment agency operations, career 
advisory service, and vocational retraining schemes for the 
unemployed. We should also develop loan schemes for new 
individual business ventures. All these projects do not require 
huge sums of money at all, and they can be easily made more 
effective using the employment office restructuring funds 
available from the budget now. 
  Another line of action we should pursue is that of placing 
greater stress on the organization of public works, emergency 
works, and a whole range of seasonal and temporary jobs. This 
could also provide steady work for a considerable number of 
unemployed. We have another project connected with this line of 
action, but the problem is that there is no legislative basis 
for allocating money from our budget for it. Some countries 
that have had many years of experience in dealing with the 
problem of unemployment operate job-seeking skills programs, 
which consist of bringing groups of unemployed people together 
and training them in how to apply for new jobs and present 
themselves to potential employers. They also brief them on 
existing employment legislation and regulations, changes in the 
labor code (for example, new regulations affecting women 
returning to work after maternity leave), and so on. 
  [Kwasniewska] The Polish Psychological Society runs similar 
"training groups...." 
  [Grela] Indeed. And if they show that something like 40 
percent of the young unemployed do indeed find jobs after 
attending their courses, it may well provide the necessary 
stimulus for the creation of further special schemes of this 
kind by, say, employment clubs. 
  [Kwasniewska] Have any particularly intensive schemes been 
introduced in areas where unemployment is more rife than 
elsewhere? For example, in Western Pomerania? 
  [Grela] So far, we have not had any spectacular successes in 
these areas. The basic assistance we are able to extend to 
those regions is that we are able to direct more resources there 
from the Employment Fund. On the other hand, investors are 
still rather reluctant to locate their capital there, despite 
considerable tax concessions and other advantageous schemes open 
to them. As a result, this year we plan to concentrate mainly 
on extending our assistance in the financing of infrastructural 
investment projects in regions where unemployment is a 
particular threat. In addition, a special government-trade 
union task group appointed by the Office of the Council of 
Ministers' Sociopolitical Committee will soon begin to identify 
the regions requiring special help. 
  [Kwasniewska] How many unemployed do we have today? 
  [Grela] The latest figure stands at 2,889,000. April was 
the third successive month in which the number of unemployed 
fell (by 64,000). It is still possible that this is a seasonal 
phenomenon, which usually occurs with the approach of summer. 
But, at the same time, it is certainly the consequence of 
making better use of the funds allocated to public and emergency 
works schemes and other similar employment projects. For 
example, in February of this year, we financed only 25 percent 
of job offers from the Employment Fund resources, whereas in 
both March and April the relevant figures were 40 percent. 
  [Kwasniewska] What about school leavers? The summer 
vacation is approaching, and so a new generation of college and 
university graduates will be leaving their educational 
establishments soon.... 
  [Grela] This problem truly gives us nightmares. As soon 
as they get their entitlement to benefits in the fall, we want 
to provide jobs for them. It would be a shame to waste all of 
that intellectual and career potential.... Apart from that 
argument, it is terribly demoralizing for young people who, 
having graduated from their schools, have nothing better to do 
than sit at home aimlessly.... 
  [Kwasniewska] Local initiatives could work wonders here. 
  [Grela] I keep saying: Unemployment is a problem for all of 
us. Also for parish authorities. Without cooperation with 
local milieus and self-government structures, employment offices 
will be unable to discharge their obligations properly. At the 
moment, they are still too isolated in their fight against 
unemployment and have to bear the lion's share of that burden 
alone. One solution here would be to galvanize various 
nongovernmental organizations and associations into action. 
Examples of various initiatives among the "grass roots" prove 
that we ourselves can do much for "our own" unemployed.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of Movement for a </F>
Democratic Slovakia, by an unidentified correspondent; place and 
date not given; reprinted from EXTRA SLOVENSKO No. 22: "One 
Hundred New Priorities"] 
  [Text] [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections, what course will its program 
pursue? 
  [Meciar] Many issues have been resolved compared with 1992. 
Slovakia has become an independent state, and its foreign policy 
orientation is also clear. The transformation process is 
continuing. It is necessary, first and foremost, to deal with 
economic issues. Our domestic conditions also need to be 
arranged afresh. If we win the elections, we will have new 
policy priorities in the HZDS. Our strategy is changing; the 
next four years will require something different from what it 
has been up to now. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to win the elections, would 
you sever all links to the current government, or would you 
carry on with the things you consider to be good? 
  [Meciar] This government has made several mistakes. It has 
halted the construction of the state and the state 
administration. It has, admittedly, implemented a verbal 
continuity, but, in fact, it prefers a different strategy for 
economic life. While we chose the strategy of recovery, it is 
proceeding toward a strategy of restriction. It favors a 
different form of privatization; it is returning to what was 
rejected in 1993. So, we could not follow up on this. We would 
have to go back to 1992. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to lose the elections, would 
you leave politics? 
  [Meciar] Probably, yes. I am offering the citizen an 
alternative. If you do not want it, fine, you have others. 
  [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Why do you not have a good personal image 
in many countries? What do you intend to do to change this 
situation? 
  [Meciar] First and foremost, if we win the elections, the 
Foreign Ministry has to improve. Every state and its 
representatives make a name for themselves abroad via the 
professionals, which is something I personally have not made use 
of yet. We also never had a foreign lobby, although the 
potential for organizing one from among Slovaks is great. We 
never knew how to address them properly. We have to change this.

<F P=106> [Article by "bog, rk": "Peter Weiss: Coalition and Hungarian </F>
Parties Must Consider Whether To Throw the Country's Political 
Stability Overboard Because of Emotions"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--Following parliament's failure to 
approve the government-sponsored bill on so-called bilingual 
signposts, we asked representatives of the government coalition 
and a representative of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement [MKDH] how they assess the nonpassage of the bill and 
whether this failure of the government coalition will not affect 
the stability of Moravcik's Cabinet. 
  Peter Weiss, [chairman of the] Party of the Democratic 
Left [SDL]: It has become apparent that extremists on both 
sides are incapable of reaching a compromise. In its final 
form, the bill was in conformity with the most important 
objections to the original draft that had come from the 
opposition, while, at the same time, respecting the 
recommendations of the Council of Europe. After the elections, 
the bill will have to be passed anyway in approximately the same 
form in which it is now. Preference was given to preelection 
tactics because the opposition wants to use the signposts as one 
of the main themes in its election campaign. A single vote was 
missing for the bill to be passed. The ability to strike a 
compromise and to realistically assess the situation should have 
been demonstrated also on the part of the Hungarian parties. It 
depends on the political judgment of members of the coalition 
and also of the MKDH and Coexistence representatives whether 
political stability in the country will be thrown overboard 
because of the wave of emotions that has artificially arisen in 
connection with this law. 
  Pal Csaky, MKDH: I assess the outcome of the vote 
as nonobservance of coalition agreements. Independent Deputy 
Kaliska, who is supposed to be a member of the government 
coalition, put forward proposals for changes that made the 
bill's passage problematic. Even deputies representing the 
government parties voted for these changes. The MKDH deputies 
all voted in favor of the bill's passage, while three 
Coexistence deputies did not endorse it because of the two 
proposals for changes made by Mrs. Kaliska. We are going to 
raise this problem at a meeting of the Coalition Council, and it 
could very well happen that this will be the last meeting of the 
Coalition Council for us. It is still premature to say whether 
we will continue supporting the government. However, the 
nonpassage of the bill will have serious political consequences. 
  Ludovit Cernak, National Democratic Party: 
Personally, I supported the bill because it seemed to be a 
compromise and also because Deputy Kaliska's proposals passed, 
which prevented the possible defamation [dehonestacia] of the 
names of communities named after Slovak national revivalists. 
The failure of some deputies of the Hungarian coalition to 
support the bill surprised me. Thereby, they actually deprived 
themselves of the argument for the Council of Europe that there 
was insufficient will in the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic to adopt this law. 
  Jan Carnogursky, Christian Democratic Movement: 
The nonpassage of the bill is unfortunate because it has only 
made matters even more complicated. Slovakia will have to deal 
with it again. Apparently, this will happen only after the 
elections. The reason for the failure to pass the bill was, in 
my opinion, the exclusion of communities named after Slovak 
historical personalities from the bilingual regime. Three 
Hungarian deputies did not vote for the bill because of this. 
However, some coalition deputies did not vote for it, either. 
This will not directly influence the functioning of the 
coalition, but it will complicate the government's position.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Duray Still Hopes"] </F>
  [Text] Budapest--Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence 
Movement, sent a congratulatory letter to all Hungarian parties 
that had won enough votes in the elections to get into the new 
Hungarian parliament. He expressed the hope that, in the years 
to come, all Hungarian deputies would adopt a more responsible 
attitude toward the 15 million Hungarians and would continue 
without disruption to implement the consolidated [jednotna] 
Hungarian policy. In the opinion of Duray, one can therefore 
"rightly expect that each Hungarian government will consider it 
its duty to support ideas formulated by the legitimate 
representatives of Hungarians living abroad, in the same way 
Antall's government did." In contrast to other ethnic Hungarian 
politicians, Duray addressed his congratulations to all 
parliamentary parties and not to the chairman of the victorious 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP).

  [Text] The FOCUS--Center for Social and Marketing Analysis 
agency conducted a public opinion survey from 9 to 23 May 1994, 
in which the organizers involved a representative sample of 
2,018 respondents. One of the questions asked was: "Had a 
referendum been held before the division of the CSFR, how would 
you have voted?" Partition would have been preferred by 27 
percent of those questioned (in October 1993, 23 percent gave 
this reply to the same FOCUS question), 57 percent would have 
voted against partition (60 percent), 11 percent would not have 
participated in the referendum (14 percent), and 5 percent did 
not know (3 percent). Asked what kind of an arrangement of 
relations between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic 
they would personally wish in the future, the respondents 
replied as follows: Two independent states would be preferred by 
35 percent (32 percent in October 1993), a confederation or 
union by 30 percent (27), a federal state by 26 percent (35), 
and another arrangement by 3 percent (2). Six percent (4) could 
not decide.

  [Excerpts] Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis gave a news 
conference this morning at the Turecky Vrch military training 
area. Milan Velecky reports: 
  [Velecky] [passage omitted] Neither journalists nor 
high-ranking officers present at the news conference liked what 
Defense Minister Pavol Kanis had to tell them. According to 
him, the Slovak Republic does not have the financial means to 
maintain even the kind of army allowed by international 
agreements. But the defense minister was not a pessimist. He 
said that defense decisions are made in line with our foreign 
policy. Contemporary European armies are open and therefore 
under international control, and our Army, not being an 
exception, does not enjoy finances received through special 
channels. Pavol Kanis hinted at a new possible means of 
income--participation in the arms trade. For example, the Army 
would claim a share in the privatization of the Slovak arms 
industry, and the defense minister hopes to see arms production 
restored to at least 25 percent of the 1988 level. 
  Improving the Army's internal economic management indirectly 
constitutes another source of income. Soldiers, too, must be 
financially accountable. 
  Defense Minister Pavol Kanis admitted that the time allotted 
to him is not enough to carry through fundamental organizational 
changes. His two priorities are a clear orientation on 
transatlantic structures and preparation of the basic legal 
documents of the defense doctrine. 
  Kanis is convinced that the Partnership for Peace project of 
cooperation with NATO will ensure Slovakia's defense guarantees. 
  Social issues remain unresolved due to the limited finances. 
The defense minister said that the length of conscript service 
could be shortened, but this would require extra expenses 
because men would have to be replaced with more effective weapon 
systems. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [TA SR report in the "Day at Home" column: "J. Moravcik on </F>
the Arms Trade"] 
  [Text] Slovakia also has the conditions for becoming 
involved in the arms trade. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik said 
this in an interview for Radiozurnal in connection with the 
recent visit made by a Chilean military delegation to the Czech 
Republic. In trading in arms, however, Slovakia must proceed 
correctly and in a manner corresponding to its international 
obligations, said the Slovak prime minister. "I do not even 
rule out the possibility of trade with Chile because it is a 
democratic country, and selling arms to this region would not 
harm our foreign policy interests," said J. Moravcik. As far as 
Augusto Pinochet is concerned, Moravcik is aware of the 
complexity of the issue of all that General Pinochet meant in 
Chile's history. First and foremost, it is up to the people of 
this country to come to terms with this issue, added Moravcik.

<F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu at Bucharest's </F>
Otopeni Airport on 8 June upon his return from an official visit 
to Croatia -- recorded] 
  [Text] We have just returned from an official visit to the 
Republic of Croatia. In keeping with the established program, 
we met with President Franjo Tudjman and Prime Minister Nikica 
Valentic, with members of the government and other officials 
from the local administration leaderships, such as the Zagreb 
City Hall and the Pula City Hall, and with other prominent 
figures from the area and from Rijeka. We also visited several 
economic units. 
  At the same time, the visit gave us the opportunity to 
discuss all matters pertaining to the development of bilateral 
relations, beginning with political issues, whereby the Croatian 
officials requested Romania's further support, in view of our 
principled position of applying equal treatment to all states in 
the former Yugoslav space. They asked that we should play a 
more active role in solving the current problems in that area. 
We also gave priority to economic matters, with both sides 
pointing out the many opportunities for developing and expanding 
our relations of cooperation and trade exchanges and for setting 
up joint companies. Of course, we are dealing here with a pretty 
broad program. However, the important thing is that all 
officials we met there asked that Romania should become involved 
in the projects for the reconstruction of the areas affected by 
the war. Here is a propitious field for an active participation 
of Romania, with various companies, in these programs. 
  We also had a talk with the economy minister from the 
Croatian-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who also asked 
for an active presence by Romania in the reconstruction areas. 
Of course, we are directly interested in all these projects, 
which have been assured of foreign financing. 
  I would like to add here that three important agreements 
were 
signed on the occasion of the visit. I am referring to the 
agreement on mutually guaranteeing and protecting investments, 
the agreement on maritime transportation, and an agreement on 
cooperation in the health sphere. We are in the process of 
finalizing an agreement on avoiding double taxation and an 
agreement between the Chambers of Trade and Industry of the two 
countries. Generally speaking, I would say that all the visited 
units expressed their interest in the resumption of our 
cooperation ventures, since there has been a sort of tradition 
-- one may say -- of cooperation in machine building, in the 
production of naval engines by Romanian and Croatian shipyards, 
as well as in metallurgy, the food industry, and the 
pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, we discussed a broad range 
of opportunities. 
  In conclusion, I would say that this visit to Croatia has 
practically been a continuation of the very efficient dialogue 
that took place during the respective visits of the two 
presidents -- I am referring to President Ion Iliescu's visit to 
Croatia and President Franjo Tudjman's visit to Romania -- and 
took place in the spirit of the Treaty of Friendship and 
Cooperation existing between the two countries. We jointly 
agreed that a number of delegations -- particularly from the big 
companies and concerns -- should come to Romania in the 
forthcoming period to put the final touches to the agreements we 
have reached during this visit. 
  Of course, we also discussed various other problems, such as 
our relations in the cultural, education, science, and sports 
spheres. We have already concluded a few accords in this 
respect. However, our greatest shortcoming is when we come to 
concretely implementing all these understandings. Consequently, 
in the forthcoming period, we plan to work out concrete action 
programs for a two-year period, which can facilitate a constant 
flow of information in both directions, a better understanding 
between the two sides, and obviously mutual support for the 
economies of both countries. 
  I would add here our intention -- which is also in 
accordance 
with the requests of our hosts -- to open a direct 
Bucharest-Zagreb air link, which can also ensure further 
connections with other areas, including such far away targets as 
Singapore, Australia, and Brazil, where there is a substantial 
Croat diaspora. This would be quite useful, and I hope that we 
will manage to achieve this goal in the coming months.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 8 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence 
Minister Pavle Bulatovic said there can be no bargaining with no 
one, either at home or abroad, over territorial integrity of 
Serbia and Montenegro, i.e. the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  `That country is the result of historical processes and 
bloody struggles for freedom against all conquerors and 
occupiers in the Balkans and no one has the right to ignore the 
blood shed in defence of this area', stressed Bulatovic in an 
interview to the weekly VOJSKA appearing on Thursday. 
  Answering the question in whose hands is the fate of peace 
in 
the Balkans, Bulatovic stressed that the big powers follow their 
own interests and create spheres of influence in the Balkans and 
beyond. `It is clear who does not want peace, and the Serbs are 
certainly not among them,' neither those (Serbs) from the 
war-shattered former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina nor 
the ones in Yugoslavia, Bulatovic specified. He said that in 
both world wars the aggressors' aim had been to exterminate the 
Serbian and Montenegrin peoples, but that they had not been 
successful in that, and now they are doing it in a much more 
perfidious way `fighting against us by applying low-intensity 
strategy', without direct involvement in war. 
  `This people must resolutely defend their freedom, as they 
had managed to do throughout their history. It has no other 
choice', said the Yugoslav defence minister.

  [Text] In honor of the upcoming Yugoslav Army Day, 16 
June, Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, chief of the Yugoslav 
Army General Staff, met in the Yugoslav Army Club with 
representatives of the media, editors in chief, and journalists 
specializing in the military field. Mijusko Tomic reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Tomic] Despite the sanctions that have 
been imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav 
Army does not lag behind other countries and armies, while its 
combat readiness is significantly higher and stronger than that 
of any other neighboring country, said General Perisic. It is 
founded on the best traditions of the Serbian and Montenegrin 
people, and it is ready to defend the independence and 
territorial integrity of our country, said Chief of General 
Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic, and stressed: 
  [Perisic] I am saying that there is no direct or immediate 
danger of war. A danger of war exists because the enemy -- the 
creator of the new world order -- has embarked on destroying the 
state of the Serbs and Montenegrins. Once he destroys their 
state, then we will behave in the manner of stateless people, 
and you know what stateless peoples are like. [sentence as 
heard] Better any kind of state than no state at all. 
Therefore, there is a great danger of war breaking out, great 
[danger], but I am saying that currently there is no immediate 
[danger], precisely because of the people's heroic resistance 
whom the Yugoslav People's Army [as heard] first trained, then 
armed, and lastly, organized and gave them the initial impulse 
to defend and succeed in defending what it has accomplished so 
far. I might also add the following: militarily speaking, more 
could not have been accomplished, of course, in areas where the 
people embraced this army as their own. [sentence as heard] 
  [Tomic] Members of the Yugoslav Army are satisfied with 
journalists' approach regarding the presentation of the 
comprehensive combat readiness and ability of the Yugoslav Army. 
It is necessary for a journalist to spread the truth about the 
army, rather than lies, which is what some journalists are 
doing, said Chief of General Staff Colonel-General Momcilo 
Perisic. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by Zvonko Prijovic: "The Missing Judge"] </F>
  [Text] Exactly a year after the arrest of the first group 
of Muslims, the trial of 25 men from Novi Pazar, Tutin, and 
Sjenica is still stuck at the beginning. The main reason is the 
unceasing search for a judge to try this case, and not one from 
Novi Pazar, where the trial is taking place, but from outside. 
First, Radomir Janicijevic and Nikola Jovicic, former judges 
from the Novi Pazar District Court, were "slated" for the trial, 
but both left the judiciary at exactly that time and joined the 
bar. Then, Dragoje Tapuskovic was brought in from Kraljevo to be 
the judge, and the trial began on 31 January, but then on 18 
February it was interrupted, because Tapuskovic had a traffic 
accident in which he was badly injured. 
  Just the other day, three months after the trial was 
interrupted, Dragomir Lelovac of Kraljevo was finally designated 
the new presiding judge. In the meantime, Sava Teofilovic, a 
judge from Novi Sad, who by decision of the Supreme Court of 
Serbia was supposed to take over the trial in Novi Pazar, 
withdrew without giving his reasons. On the insistence of many 
attorneys that a new judge be designated as soon as possible, 
Nuho Mehovic, president of the district court in Novi Pazar, 
said that he was unable to form a new panel without consent of 
the presiding judge of the Supreme Court of Serbia, and he 
referred the attorneys to Caslav Ignjatovic. 
  By all appearances, it seems that the indictment charging 25 
people with threatening the territorial integrity of the FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] dictates this kind of behavior 
by representatives of the supreme and district courts, but many 
people are inclined to believe that the trial is being dragged 
out and a new judge is being constantly sought so that the case 
would not be conducted by any of the judges (Muslims) from Novi 
Pazar. 
<H5>  The Turkish School </H5>
  The entire case began in May of last year with the arrest of 
four Muslims in whose possession, according to the news release 
of the Serbian MUP [Ministry of Internal Affairs], was found a 
large quantity of arms, explosives, and war plans. Arrests 
continued in the days that followed, and soon there were 25 
persons of Muslim nationality behind bars. The indictment then 
said that the objective of the arrestees was to create by the 
use of force an independent state of "Sandzak" from a part of 
the territory of the FRY, that they drew up war plans and other 
plans to that end, that they established military and police 
units, and that they acquired large quantities of arms and 
explosives without authorization. 
  Not long after that, an indictment was returned against 
Sulejman Ugljanin, leader of the SDA [Democratic Action Party] 
for Sandzak, who at that time was outside the country. Although 
from the very outset Ugljanin has been mentioned as the main 
culprit and was mentioned in connection with the first arrests, 
he left the country quite legally. In any case, one group of 
members of the Serbian MUP nevertheless arrived in front of his 
house to arrest him, that is, to detain him. We will soon learn 
whether the state agencies here intentionally gave the 
appearance of releasing Ugljanin to leave or this was a mere 
coincidence. Those who are very familiar with the situation in 
Sandzak believe that it was the former, because in that way they 
prevented him from returning to the country. 
  Sokol Ahmetovic, another of the key people in all of this, 
was also outside Yugoslavia when the indictment was brought. He 
is charged with organizing the departure of young Muslims for 
military training in Turkey. Back in the middle of last year, 
BORBA carried the story of one of them who went through that 
training, and recently our newsman heard the same story in Rudo. 
A young man from the vicinity of Prijepolje, who spent some 40 
days in a military camp near Izmir along with 80 other young men 
from Sandzak, is in the prison there. According to his account, 
a fair number of those were convinced that they were going to 
Turkey to work, but once they got there they were compelled by 
threats to obey, and all of this was aimed at creating a free 
Sandzak to which they would return as military officers. 
However, after they returned to the country he and many others 
were forced to flee either abroad or to Bosnia, where they 
joined the Muslims. And that is how this lad was arrested--in 
the attempt to get through to Gorazde or Sarajevo. 
<H5>  Showdown With the SDA </H5>
  Because both Ugljanin and Ahmetovic are inaccessible to 
judicial authorities, Milan Veselinovic, federal deputy of the 
SRS [Serbian Radical Party] from Novi Pazar, predicts "that all 
the blame will be put on those 25 arrestees, while the main 
culprits and ideologues will remain protected and unpunished." 
Zoran Jovanovic, chairman of the Novi Pazar Committee of the 
SRS, says that the Muslims have created paramilitary units, have 
sent their children for military training, so that tomorrow, if 
needed, they could fight against the Serbs. At the same time, 
the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] in Novi Pazar says in its 
news release that "the way in which this case is being treated 
is yet another political act that serves to disgrace the Serbian 
nation and state." 
  The SDA for Sandzak sees this entire trial as an attempt to 
settle accounts with the Muslim people, but it is most likely 
that the trial will also make it easier to attack that party, 
which frequently represents itself as the sole legitimate 
representative of the Muslims in Sandzak. This can be read 
between the lines of the statement by Radmilo Bogdanovic made 
recently in Prijepolje: 
  "The elements have long existed to ban the operation of the 
Democratic Action Party. We did not do that, because this would 
have been interpreted as a threat to their rights. It would only 
have brought us foreign delegations, because Ugljanin has turned 
to everyone in the world to say that the `Muslims are 
threatened.'" 
  Numerous defense attorneys have been thinking in precisely 
those terms in the statements they have made so far. Thus, Rajko 
Danilovic says that "this trial is obviously aimed at a showdown 
between the incumbent regime and the SDA, and the possession of 
arms is a commonplace in ethnically mixed communities." That is 
close to the thinking of Azem Vlasi, who says: "A trial is being 
prepared for these citizens because they dared to think about 
whether they could do something if necessary to the end of their 
own self-defense, that is, defense of their people and the 
territory where they live. And the need for defense is not some 
function or consequence of a persecution mania, but a part of 
our reality. It is hard to believe that there is anyone who is 
not thinking about this today even in the situation when the 
government is protecting him, but not in this case." 
  Seven of the arrestees recently wrote to the Serbian justice 
minister and said in their letter: "It seems that in our case no 
one is in a hurry to hear and prove the truth. Although a year 
has already passed, we are still hostages to those who are 
hunting fabricated enemies. The proceedings in the 
investigation, seeking and bringing in judges from outside, 
although there are five judges in the district court in Novi 
Pazar, bring us to doubt the objectivity of this court. Do we 
have to be tried by some obedient Serb, against all legal and 
moral standards?" 
<H5>  Unsolved Hijacking </H5>
  The upcoming trial in Novi Pazar, whose resumption is 
scheduled for 25 May, must nevertheless answer the key question: 
Did the arrested Muslims intend to redraw borders by force under 
the sponsorship of the SDA, or did they arm themselves for 
self-defense? Provided the trial is legal, and not politically 
colored. 
  When we bear in mind the way in which problems are being 
solved in our region and the bloody outcome of the Yugoslav war 
drama, it will not be easy to distinguish what part was a need 
to collect arms for security and what part consisted of 
extremist political objectives in order to create the so-called 
republic of Sandzak. In the section that borders Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, the Muslims have not been living in peace for the 
last two or three years. This has been most pronounced in Priboj 
and Pljevlja Opstinas. Many people remember two hijackings--17 
Muslim inhabitants of the village Sjeverin were taken from a bus 
in Mioce, and the same number of Muslims were taken from a train 
standing in the Strpci station. Even today, nothing has been 
officially solved concerning their fate. Only that recently 
suspicion fell on one person for kidnapping them. 
  So, then, will the weapons and war plans that were found be 
sufficient grounds to support the charge that the accused were 
really threatening the territorial integrity of a state which 
was unable to guarantee them any kind of security? Or will the 
trial try to prove that the threat to the Muslims did not evoke 
the extremism, but that from the very outset this was a 
characteristic of the leading circles in the SDA, in particular 
its leader Sulejman Ugljanin, who even before the war in the 
former Bosnia and Herzegovina was declaring "We will either die 
or be free"? 
  Like many former leaders of the SDA, Ugljanin is outside 
Yugoslavia. The people who will have to continue to live 
together in Sandzak or Raska Oblast have remained here.

  [Text] Geneva, June 8 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan 
Karadzic said Wednesday he was pessimistic about the chances of 
a scaled-down UN ceasefire proposal. "This is a mere ceasefire. 
We have had many many ceasefires that did not work," Karadzic 
said about the latest proposal submitted at talks in the Swiss 
city to end fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina between a 
Moslem-Croat alliance and the Serbs. 
  "We are here to sign a cessation of hostilities agreement. 
Ceasefires can be signed at the Sarajevo Airport," he said. He 
said he had "not too many hopes" because the international 
community was "very permissive towards the Moslems." 
  UN envoy Yasushi Akashi said he would offer Bosnia's warring 
parties a scaled-down ceasefire proposal Wednesday in a 
concession to Bosnia's Moslem government. Akashi confirmed that 
the length of the truce remained the main obstacle in 
negotiations between Bosnia's Moslem-Croat alliance and Serb 
forces. Aides said his offer involved a two-month truce, 
compared to the initial proposal of four months which the 
Bosnian Government has rejected. 
  The head of the Bosnian delegation, Bosnian Vice President 
Ejup Ganic, said before talks resumed Wednesday that Akashi had 
proposed a four-week renewable truce -- the length sought by the 
country's Moslem-Croat Federation. Ganic said Akashi was 
proposing that at the end of the four-week ceasefire a further 
extension could be decided if there was progress in separate 
political and territorial discussions among the warring parties. 
He called the offer "very constructive" and a "very promising" 
proposal.

<F P=106> [Commentary by T. Cela: "Caution and Speculation Over the </F>
Kosova Issue -- Serbs Propose Dialogue Between Foreign 
Ministers"] 
  [Text] Something is moving in Serb Albanian relations. 
This time, as TANJUG reported on 2 June, it is the self-styled 
Yugoslavia that wishes to suggest to Albania the start of a 
dialogue at foreign-minister level. The Yugoslav Government 
outlined relations between the two countries and entrusted the 
Foreign Ministry with "renewing the proposal for dialogue." 
  Dialogue between Prishtina and Belgrade began to take up 
column inches in the press especially after the visit of the 
British minister Douglas Hogg, who announced after his talks 
with the Serbian leader Milosevic that the latter was ready to 
talk with representatives from Kosova about the restitution of 
some kind of autonomy similar to that of 1974, while stressing 
again that he categorically cannot allow a change in the borders 
of Yugoslavia. 
  The two Albanian leaders Rugova and Berisha showed a 
readiness for dialogue months ago, but always conditional on the 
presence of a third party. Meanwhile, Rugova is continuing his 
visit to a series of European countries, holding meetings with 
high-level officials of these countries, and holding fast to the 
view of an independent and neutral Kosova. Rugova proposes a 
civil protectorate as a transitional phase in order to avert 
conflict. 
  In this situation, when a gentle, softening breeze has begun 
to blow across the diplomatic landscape, daily life in Kosova 
has not changed in the least. In Prishtina, the Serbian police 
continue to beat and maltreat Albanian political activists. 
Rugova, speaking to Deutsche Welle, called this repression an 
attempt to publicly weaken the position of Kosovar diplomacy. 
Rugova also stressed that it is unlikely that dialogue with the 
Serbian side will be imminent. 
  Meanwhile, some British and Serbian newspapers have recently 
reported secret meetings between some Albanian and Serbian 
representatives at a foreign embassy. According to these 
newspapers, these talks have involved the Serbian Socialist 
Markovic, the Kosovar journalist and intellectual Veton Surroi, 
and Fehmi Agani, deputy Chairman of the Kosova Democratic 
Alliance. It is said that Markovic proposed to these two 
Albanians talks about education and health, etc., with the aim 
of normalizing relations between the Republic of Serbia and the 
Albanians of Kosova. All these proposals contradict what is 
happening in Albanian everyday life, and it seems that Rugova is 
right when he says that "The Serbs want to publicly weaken our 
position." 
  The British newspaper THE GUARDIAN quotes one Western 
diplomat as saying "There are movements of several kinds, but it 
sometimes seems to me that we are trying to bore a tunnel with a 
needle." 
  The Kosovar leader Agani, said to have taken part in the 
secret talks, nevertheless recently said that "If we are told 
that we must be part of Serbia, this is the same as telling us 
to continue to suffer under Serbian rule. This idea has no 
future." Agani thus conclusively proved that he continues to be 
Rugova's right-hand man. 
  In the meantime, Albania, although its parliament 
unanimously 
recognized the Republic of Kosova, is showing itself to be 
increasingly cautious in its statements. The only joint 
statement issued by Albanian and Kosovar leaders and diplomats 
is that "Albania favors Albanian-Serb dialogue, in the presence 
of a third party." This caution in Albanian policy is a result 
of a kind of pressure exerted by international diplomacy on 
Albania, so that Albania may exert influence in softening the 
Albanian radical factions across the border. At a news 
conference one week ago, the Albanian Sooialist leaders called 
the policy over the issue of Kosova pursued by the leaders in 
power today a failure. However, this cannot be said now that 
Tirana is following from behind the steps of international 
diplomacy concerning the destiny of Kosova, and has conflict 
avoidance as the foundation of its policy.

  [Text] Belgrade, 8 Jun (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic, president 
of the republic of Serb Krajina, said today that the objective 
of his visit to Geneva was to find a solution for the 
continuation of negotiations with Croatia. 
  "Prior to my departure, we in the inner leadership of the 
republic of Serb Krajina had agreed to display flexibility and 
agree to discuss economic relations on the territory of Serb 
Krajina with the Croatian delegation," Martic said in a 
statement carried by Radio Belgrade. 
  "Repeated Croatian media claims that the republic of Serb 
Krajina is an integral part of Croatia should not irritate us, 
because it is clear here in Geneva and to the whole world that 
this is not the case. We were received at the highest level 
here, and I could safely say that this was a diplomatic victory 
for us, victory in the sense that cochairmen Owen and 
Stoltenberg provided certain guarantees that they would be 
absolutely in favor of unprecedented sanctions being introduced 
against Croatia in the case of fresh aggression by Croatia 
against the republic of Serb Krajina. We were told the same by 
Akashi," Martic said. 
  According to him, the talks to be held in Plitvice on 16 and 
17 June will not prejudice political solutions. This, Martic 
believes, "will be an opportunity for the whole world and the 
reporters gathered in Plitvica to find out to whom Plitvice 
really belongs." 
  Likewise, he said that he had also received assurances from 
the cochairmen, as well as Mr. Akashi, that they would do 
everything to ensure that Croatia honored the first stage of the 
agreement on the cessation of hostilities concerning those 
articles it had not honored in the past. "Therefore, this is a 
great step forward, and I personally believe that Akashi will 
stand by his word and that this will be carried out 
immediately," Martic said. Martic also said that the Serb 
Krajina delegation had been received in Geneva "at the highest 
level" and that "an important diplomatic move" had been made, 
which "opened the front door in international relations where 
the republic of Serb Krajina is concerned."

<F P=106> [Report by Attila Gy. Fekete: "Fidesz Does Not Want To Be </F>
Part of the Government -- Less Than a Fifth of the Leadership 
Would Say Yes to the MSZP"] 
  [Text] According to NEPSZABADSAG's information, the 
majority of the National Committee of the Federation of Young 
Democrats [Fidesz] would be against a coalition cooperation with 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] if the party that was 
victorious at the elections sent an official request to the 
Young Democrats. According to the party's leadership, the 
Fidesz's moral standing would be lost if, giving up its values 
advocated in the campaign, it joined the emerging social-liberal 
coalition. 
  The Fidesz's official view has not changed: The party is 
only 
willing to react to an official coalition offer received 
directly from the MSZP. At the same time, influential people in 
the Fidesz firmly stated that the mood in the party's leading 
bodies is against the coalition; a proposal to work together 
with the MSZP would not even receive the support of one-fifth of 
those in decisionmaking positions. The members who stated this 
used the decision of the Fidesz's April 1993 congress held in 
Debrecen as an argument which stipulated two conditions for 
cooperating with the MSZP: The MSZP should not be a subservient 
party to the trade unions, and that a change of generations 
should take place in the Socialist leadership. According to 
Fidesz politicians, neither of these conditions have been met; 
therefore, acceptance of a possible coalition offer would go 
against the party congress decision. 
  Fidesz members also emphasized that the party would lose its 
moral standing if it entered the coalition because, in its 
election campaign, it had contrary goals to this, including 
"preventing the former leaders from returning to power." 
According to politicians, with their 20 parliamentary deputies, 
the Young Democrats would be just as unimportant partners in a 
coalition as the Christian Democratic People's Party was in the 
past four years alongside the Hungarian Democratic Forum. 
However, in opposition, the Fidesz could win over those liberals 
who are disappointed with the social-liberal government. 
  According to our information, the coalition agreement of the 
Socialists and Free Democrats might in spite of all this leave 
the possibility open for the Fidesz perhaps to join later.

<F P=106> [Article by M.P.: "Rich Men's Club Opens Its Door; Poland To </F>
Be in OECD in Two Years?"] 
  [Text] The OECD has expressed its consent to accept 
four new countries as members: Poland, Hungary, the Czech 
Republic, and Slovakia (those countries have already submitted 
their applications for membership). An agreement on cooperation 
with Russia was also signed, whose goal is to support the 
economic reforms taking place in that country. 
  Ministers of the most developed countries who gathered in 
Paris on Wednesday particularly strongly stressed the need to 
support free-market reforms in the countries of East Europe, 
through their inclusion in the OECD. The organization was 
established in 1960 to replace the Marshall Plan. 
  I am convinced that the exceptional capabilities of the OECD 
render the organization an ideal means for widening our 
integration into the world in the post-Cold War era, just as the 
previous measure--that is, the Marshall Plan--was a model for 
West Europe in the first years of the Cold War, said U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. The OECD can currently 
contribute on a larger scale to finalizing the process of 
postwar reconstruction by helping an increased number of 
countries around the world join the group of highly 
industrialized countries. 
  The OECD also agreed to begin negotiations with South Korea 
concerning its joining the organization. The possibility of 
rapprochement with China is also being considered, but that 
would take place within a cooperation agreement rather than 
within membership. Observers say that the process of obtaining 
full membership by countries who desire it is a question of not 
more than two years' time. I think the issue is about 15-18 
months, says Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet. But other 
participants of the debate stressed that negotiations could go 
on for longer than that because of the economic difficulties 
East European countries are experiencing. 
  The participants of the meeting are particularly happy 
because Russia, which in the postwar period refused to join the 
Marshall Plan, has now agreed to sign an agreement with the 
OECD, an organization that for a long time was criticized as a 
rich men's club. 
<H5>  [Box, p 1] </H5>
  In a communique announced after the Paris meeting, the OECD 
ministers, among other things: 


    -  Declare that there are more and more signs of an 
improved economic situation. 
  -  Reject protectionism in any 
form. 
  -  Declare the need to implement macroeconomic policies that 
would support strong and inflation-free economic growth. 
  -  Stress 
the importance of reductions of budget deficits over the medium 
term. 
  -  Appeal for increased flexibility of the labor 
market. 
  -  Agree to defend the principles of free trade.

the Slovak Republic as extremely necessary. As far as the 
crisis in parliament is concerned, he is of the opinion that the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia is to blame for the 
situation. [passage omitted] 
  In the interview, Moravcik also responded to a REUTER report 
on the problems within the Slovak banking system. According to 
him, the Slovak Government will take measures to ensure that the 
situation depicted in the agency's inaccurate report does not 
arise. He described the banking system as the economy's nervous 
system. The Slovak Government intends to keep it in order. 
"Everything indicates that we have a firm grip on the situation 
and that there is no danger," he said.

the Blocking of 35 Million ECU Granted to Albania by EU"] 
  [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The EU ambassador in Albania 
Mr. Elio Germano pronounced today on Radio Tirana on the 
blocking of EU [European Union] assistance to Albania. Mr. 
Germano said "Actually the European Union has not taken a 
decision on the 35 million ECU granted to Albania and in fact we 
cannot speak of a Greek veto but of their reserve expressed in 
one of the meeting of the Council of the Finance Ministers of 
the European Union, which they had not taken it back yet." 
European ambassador pointed out that we cannot take a decision 
on financial issues in the community, if there is no unanimity 
on it. He stressed that European Union wants to rediscuss the 
issue in the meeting of the foreign ministers of twelve 
countries, on June 13th. 
  "We hope to take unanimous decision on this particular 
issue," said he, stressing "that it cannot be concealed that a 
tension exists, an obstacle between EU country member which 
Greece is and a country with which Europe has agreements of 
trade and cooperation, and once more according to this agreement 
an integration of Albania is foreseen, and above all your 
country is not a common partner but a privileged one. The Greek 
Government has expressed considerations of political nature, but 
it should be stressed it is only its stand," he clarified.

  [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The leaders of Albanian 
parliamentary parties were pronounced today on Radio Tirana on 
the Greek veto for blocking the assistance worth 35 million ECU, 
which European Union has granted to Albania. 
  The chairman of Democratic Party, Eduard Selami, considered 
the veto "as an irresponsible attitude of Greek Government," 
which is part of "others non-friendly ones and not in favour of 
Albania." Mr. Selami expressed his hope "in the Greek moderate 
part" and considered the veto mechanism by Greece as "an abusive 
act." The leader of the democrats, who have the majority in the 
parliament, expressed his readiness for dialogue, but pointed 
out that "they (Greeks) should react seriously, if they are for 
dialogue and for the positive solution of these problems." 
  The chairman of Social Democratic Party, Mr. Skender 
Gjinushi, considered as "unacceptable" the attitude of Greek 
Government, "above all, now that Albania is experiencing the 
transitional period." Mr. Gjinushi pointed out that the idea of 
non-respecting the rights of Greek minority in Albania "is 
groundless" and said that the Greek Government should reflect on 
this issue. The social democratic leader also requested the 
continuation of the dialogue with the Greek side. 
  Mr. Sabri Godo, the leader of the republicans, said that the 
blocking of the funds by Greece "is a resentment of Balkanic 
style, which was not expected by Papandreou government, who is a 
statesman with broad culture." Mr. Godo pointed out "that 
Greece is not paying, but Europe is." 
  While deputy chairman of Socialist Party, Mr. Servet 
Pellumbi, considered the blocking of 35 million ECU as an act of 
the European Union and not Greece and demanded that "all of us 
should reflect" upon this issue because "it looks like Europe 
has serious remarks on the respect of its European standards in 
Albania." 
  Deputy chairman of the Human Rights Party, Mr. Kosta 
Makariadhi, said that "there are some requirements, which should 
be respected by the countries, that require aid from European 
Union," among which he mentioned the honouring of the human 
rights. According to him "there are flagrant violations of 
human rights in Albania."

  [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- A delegation of the 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Parliament headed by its speaker, Stojan Andov, arrived 
yesterday to Albania for a two-day official and friendly visit, 
at the invitation of the Albanian speaker of parliament, Pjeter 
Arbnori. 
  At the meeting with Mr. Andov at the People's Assembly 
headquarters, Mr. Arbnori said Albania is a peace and stability 
factor in the region. Speaking of the relations with The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mr. Arbnori said he was for the 
increase in all the fields. He pointed out that Albania makes 
efforts for human and national rights of the Albanians who live 
in their own territories. These problems, he said, will be 
resolved by understanding and tolerance without changing the 
borders violently. 
  Mr. Andov admitted that Albanians in Macedonia represent a 
great number of the total population adding that "we have 
created normal conditions basing on the standards." Though, Mr. 
Andov admitted that a difference exist between the written and 
the real rights. Mr. Arbnori and Mr. Andov spoke of the 
dramatic situation in Kosova. 
  Later on, the speaker of the Macedonian Parliament, Andov, 
met with representatives of the parliamentary groups: Ali 
Spahia, the Democratic Party representative; Namik Dokle, 
Socialist Party representative; and Haxhi Aliko, Social 
Democratic Party representative. The two sides expressed their 
readiness for expanding the interparliamentary contacts which 
will influence on the extending of the cooperation between the 
two countries. 
  The Macedonian parliamentary delegation had a meeting with 
representatives of the parliamentary commission for the foreign 
policy, in which the journalists were not allowed to assist.

  [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- Speakers of the Albanian 
and Macedonian Parliaments said at a press conference on June 3 
that their countries have made important steps for the 
consolidation of bilateral cooperation and stressed that the 
best way for this the continuation of the dialogue. 
  Mr. Arbnori said that Albania and [The Former Yugoslav

progress towards democratization and this is the most important 
point for the future of the two countries. Both speakers 
appreciated Albania's support for Macedonia's membership in the 
CSCE. 
  "A special place in our talks was given to the question of 
the Albanians living in their territories in Macedonia," Mr. 
Arbnori said, mentioning that they themselves are interested in 
the development, integrity, and cooperation of Macedonia with 
the world. Regarding the Macedonian minority in Albania, Mr. 
Arbnori said that their small number does not mean that their 
rights should not be observed. 
  Further on, Mr. Arbnori said that rapprochement and 
cooperation with a neighbouring country must not imply enmity 
with a third one. 
  Mr. Andov said that during his visit to Albania, he had 
noticed important changes and a great readiness for an extension 
of bilateral relations, which are important not only for the two 
countries but for the whole region. He said the his government 
is ready to work for the realisation of all the rights of the 
Albanians in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia so that 
they be free citizens of a stable state.

  [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- President Berisha and 
Speaker of the Macedonian Parliament Andov said yesterday that 
important steps have been made in the relations between the two 
countries and that the two parties are engaged in further 
developing cooperation and understanding between them. 
  Berisha said that Albania is interested in Macedonia's [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] stability. "We 
encourage the Albanians that they should be a factor of 
stability for Macedonia, just as we insist that the recognition 
of human and national rights of the Albanians residing there 
serves the stability of the Macedonian state itself. In this 
context, mutual respect between the Albanians and Macedonians is 
of specific importance," President Berisha said. 
  Mr. Andov appreciated the Albanian policy in the Balkans as 
well the facilities Albania has created to Macedonia to cope 
with the Greek embargo. He demanded from President Berisha 
Albania's support for Macedonia's membership of CSCE, the Black 
Sea initiative as well as other institutions, whose member 
Albania is. President Berisha assured the speaker of the 
Macedonian Parliament that Albania will support Macedonia's 
membership of CSCE as well as its membership in the Black Sea 
initiative. "I consider the enlargement of the Black Sea 
initiative with a new member as a very significant moment," he 
said.

  [Text] Tirana, June 3 (ATA) -- Prime Minister Meksi met on 
June 3 with the speaker of Macedonian Parliament, Mr. Andov. 
They discussed the possibilities for the development of the 
relations between the two countries in various fields of mutual 
interest. 
  "We are neighbours and have had good relations which we 
should further develop," Mr. Meksi said, adding that 
"observation of the rights of all the nationalities living in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and of the Albanians in particular, of their status, are an 
expression of the application and observation of the European 
documents and norms, guaranteed human rights." 
  Focusing on the possibilities existing for an economic 
cooperation, Mr. Meksi mentioned such fields as transport, 
electric power, fuel, border trade, facilitation of conditions 
for private business, culture, education, and science. 
  Mr. Andov expressed Macedonia's commitment to respect all 
the 
rights of the Albanians, adjustment of their status, a real 
census of the population and the readiness for a broader 
cooperation in the economic field. Mr. Andov appreciated the 
readiness of Albania to help Macedonia to overcome the Greek 
embargo and Albania's stand about events in the Balkans. 
  Both sides stressed the need of increasing bilateral 
contacts 
and materialization of bilateral initiative in the fields of 
mutual interest and to the benefit of the two peoples.

  [Text] Tirana, June 8 (ATA) -- The trial of ten former 
senior officials of the communist system in Albania continued 
yesterday with testimonies from witnesses. Defendants Adil 
Carcani and Manush Myftiu did not appear in the court because of 
their serious health problems and they were defended by their 
attorneys. 
  Nine intellectuals, called the group of Ballsh, were 
arrested 
on September 21, 1982. On September 23 and 27 of the same year 
they were tried by Fehmi Abdiu (now a Socialist Party deputy) 
and they were sentenced with 69 years of imprisonment, 35 years 
in concentration camps, and 35 years of denial of the right to 
take part in elections. Five out of the nine intellectuals, 
Muhamet Xhaferri, Selfo Pasha, Vullnet Arabicka, Musa Begaj, and 
Spiro Sofroni were witnesses in the yesterday's session. The 
witnesses responded questions by the defence attorneys and 
explained the circumstances of their detention, sentencing and 
internment, underlining the negative role of Defendant Zylyftar 
Ramizi in the trial. The families of the witnesses had been 
sent to concentration camps upon a decision of the commission of 
concentration camps three days before the present witnesses were 
tried. 
  Seven other witnesses, members of the formerly persecuted 
families under the motivation "persons of great danger for the 
society," witnessed as well. Other witnesses were Fatbardh and 
Riza Caniku, expelled for an unlimited term for having a bad 
biography; Sutkie Konica expelled because her mother was a 
Yugoslav national; Saryhan Merdani, interned together with her 
relatives for bad biography; Mimoza Sherifi, Perparim Skendo, 
and Pertef Gega, also sent to concentration camps for the same 
reason. The next session opens on June 8, at 1600.

  [Text] Tirana, June 6 (ATA) -- The newspaper REPUBLIKA on 
its edition of June 5 publishes in the first page a big photo, 
on the centre of which is the Greek priest Sebastianos. Mr. 
Vangjel Dule, the interpreter and the attendant of His 
Excellence Janullatos; Mr. Panajot Barka, the leader of Omonia; 
Mr. Hajtidhi, the prefect of Salonika who hands over diplomas 
for "merits" in the Hellenization of the south of Albania; Mr. 
Theothori Bezhani, who has shown himself openly in the favour of 
the autonomy of the Greeks in the south; Mr. Grigor Drigoja, the 
chairman of SFEVA, the association of the students for the fight 
for the liberation of "Vorio-Epir" (which organized recently a 
manifestation before the Albanian Embassy in Athens); Mr. 
Dhimiter Caka, the chief-editor of the newspaper OMONIA, are 
also present in the photo. 
  "In a way, this is the government proposed by Mr. Qiriazati 
in his letter for Micotaqis," the newspaper stresses, going on 
that the program of the government publishes since two years ago 
in the Greek papers and in a part of the Albanian ones, which 
stay silent now just like a person who feels guilty, waiting 
anxiously for any possible exposition of any duty charged them 
by this government. 
  "Here are the money, the church, the state and the bandits," 
the newspaper REPUBLIKA writes.

<F P=106> ["Statement of the Democratic Party of Albania for the Final </F>
Results of the Elections for Local Government in Some Communes 
of Albania"] 
  [Text] Tirana, June 7 (ATA) -- The Democratic Party of 
Albania reports that the latest elections which were conducted 
in over 30 villages of five communes are a great victory for 
this party. In these elections the DP [Democratic Party] took 
80 per cent of the votes for the leading staff in the communes 
and 66 per cent of the votes. In Zall-Herr the DP received 32 
per cent of the votes a week ago while in yesterday's elections, 
due to an intensive work and understanding with the Republican 
Party, the DP won 56 per cent of the votes. 
  The final results of the elections in the five communes are 
as follows: 
  1. Zall-Rec -- The DP won 55 per cent and the SP [Socialist 
Party] 19 per cent of the votes. 
  2. Zall-Herr -- The DP won 56 per cent and the SP 44 per 
cent. 
  3. Libofshe -- The DP won 68 per cent and the SP 28 per 
cent. 
  4. Ngracan -- The DP won 66 per cent and the SP 34 per cent. 
  5. Greshice -- The DP won 40 per cent and the SP 56 per 
cent. 
  The DP considers the elections an important victory and a 
development of democracy because considering the geographic 
extension and the number of voters, these elections were a 
really great test of general values. 
  Making an analysis of the latest elections and due to its 
program, it comes out that the DP has won 42.2 per cent more 
votes which in the elections of July 22, 1992 had been cast for 
the SP. This great defeat of the SP is related with the fact 
that when electors seek alternatives, the only one the SP 
presents them is destruction, the statement says in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Krezimir Zubak, president of the </F>
Croat-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, by Ana Fernandez 
in Geneva; date not given] 
  [Text] Geneva -- Krezimir Zubak has been president of the 
brand-new Croat-Muslim Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina since 1 
June. Enormously discreet and of a negotiatory turn of mind, 
this 46-year-old lawyer and father of two has exchanged weapons, 
which gravely wounded him, for words to end this war which has 
been devastating the former Yugoslav republic for over two 
years. On Bosnia's future, Zubak says that Serbs, Croats, and 
Muslims must coexist. "We have lived and will have to live 
together." 
  Although it is not the first time that he has come to Geneva 
-- he has been a member of the Croat delegation on many 
occasions -- the new round of UN-backed negotiations is proving 
a baptism of fire for this "political amateur," as he describes 
himself, since on this occasion he shares the billing in the 
same delegation with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic, who, at 
least publicly, calls the shots. 
  [Fernandez] Does the setting up of the Croat-Muslim 
Federation mean that the differences between these two peoples, 
who were enemies until a few weeks ago, have disappeared? 
  [Zubak] The setting up of the Bosnian Federation is an 
extremely important step for creating trust between Muslims and 
Croats. With it, a political agreement which satisfies both 
peoples' interests has been reached, and we believe that it is 
also a good framework which can accommodate and satisfy a third 
people's interests. 
  [Fernandez] But after two years of war and ethnic cleansing, 
is it still possible to believe that the Serbs will wish to join 
this federation? 
  [Zubak] The war will have to end some day, and it will have 
to end with a political agreement. There have been several wars 
in our nation's history, and all of them were ended. This war 
will be ended, too. 
  [Fernandez] Do the Croat and Muslim military chiefs also 
accept this agreement without reservations? 
  [Zubak] The agreement which has been reached is a package of 
measures. When we concluded the political agreement, we signed 
a military agreement which has now begun to be implemented, and 
in fact it is the one which is producing better results on the 
ground. Immediately after the signing of the military 
agreement, the hostilities between Croats and Muslims ceased, 
and this means that the two peoples have achieved a political 
solution, which is the way to end this war. We have lived and 
will have to live together. Let us hope that the Serbs will 
also reach the same conclusion. 
  [Fernandez] How do you explain the many turnabouts by the 
Croats, who at the beginning of the war were on the side of the 
Muslims, then of the Serbs, and now of the Muslims again? 
  [Zubak] I believe that this is a mistaken conclusion. The 
Croats have always had a very clear political option, and this 
option was to set up a federal state or a confederation. We 
have always been in favor of Bosnia-Herzegovina's being a 
pluralist country. Now we have agreed with the Bosnians the 
framework for this country, which means that our political aim 
is being achieved. 
  [Fernandez] What are your territorial claims for the new 
federation? 
  [Zubak] We claim 58 percent of the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, based on the 1991 census, in which the 
Bosnians and Croats were the majority, and this is in line with 
the principles expressed by the international community, which 
rejects ethic cleansing and aggression. The offer which we 
currently have gives us 51 percent, and the remaining 49 percent 
for the Serbs. 
  [Fernandez] But the international community supports the 
51-49 percent plan, including the United States, which initially 
supported your 58-percent claim. 
  [Zubak] This means that they do not respect their own 
principles. We are prepared to reach a compromise if 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is a viable state and if the international 
community gives us assurances that this agreement will be 
implemented. 
  [Fernandez] Are you in favor of lifting the arms embargo 
imposed on the Bosnians? 
  [Zubak] I repeat that nothing is resolved through war. I am 
in favor of resolving problems through political agreements. If 
this were not possible, it would be just to grant the Croats and 
Bosnians the right to defend ourselves.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Renzo </F>
Cianfanelli in central Bosnia; date not given: "NATO Out of the 
Balkans"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Cianfanelli] Strategically the 
Serbs, even if numerically in a minority, are the stronger and 
have practically attained all their objectives. In Bosnia right 
now you control more than 70 percent of the territory. [Bosnian 
Serbs leader] Karadzic himself says that he is ready to make 
sizable concessions in order to achieve peace. What more 
remains? As a military man, how do you view the situation now? 
  [Mladic] The reply can be read in what Muslim General Rasim 
Delic said very recently to the LJILIAN newspaper. I can only 
add that, with the very recent creation of the Muslim-Croat 
federation, an enormous potential for war has been released 
which is turned against us. 
  [Cianfanelli] Which, specifically? 
  [Mladic] I am talking of attacks against us. Until a few 
days ago there was intense fighting in this same region near the 
Zvornik corridor. The Muslims have attacked us several times in 
the area of Srbobran, Turbe, and Mount Vlasic. They have also 
violated the truce around Bugojno and in the Sarajevo 
demilitarized zone. 
  [Cianfanelli] But there is also news of Serbian troop 
movements around the Brcko corridor, where, it is feared, the 
next crisis could explode. How is the situation at Brcko? 
  [Mladic] Stable. 
  [Cianfanelli] Do you mean that there are no encounters? 
  [Mladic] On the contrary, every day we are subjected to 
provocations from the Muslims with tanks, artillery, and 
medium-caliber weapons. The Croats in the meantime are 
attacking us from the direction of Orasje, and to the south of 
Brcko they are involved in joint actions, which we are opposing. 
  [Cianfanelli] At Sarajevo General Delic told us that you 
want 
to enlarge the Brcko corridor from three to ten kilometers. Is 
this true? 
  [Mladic] We have not moved in the corridor since 28 June 
1992. 
  [Cianfanelli] Are you then ready to sign a truce with Delic 
which would be respected by both parties? 
  [Mladic] I am not interested in a truce with Delic. When we 
got him with his back to the wall at Gorazde, all Delic knew 
what to do was to scream for help from the United Nations, 
inundating the runways of the NATO airport with rivers of Muslim 
tears. His one aim was to force the West to intervene... In 
any event, we are ready to negotiate for a political peace on 
all territorial disputes which are currently outstanding in 
Bosnia. Before Gorazde I was in Sarajevo three times. I 
negotiated with General Rose and was ready to negotiate with the 
Muslim and Croat commanders. But they did not come. Their aim 
was to tie my hands with the negotiations, whilst continuing to 
attack me in Gorazde and in central Bosnia. 
  [Cianfanelli] Excuse me for being frank. From your point of 
view Gorazde was not a success. In terms of international 
image, the siege was a disaster for you. Think only of the 
negative publicity, and the risk of a massive NATO intervention. 
  [Mladic] There we go, NATO. But do you not see in Italy 
either that NATO is looking for an excuse to move its advanced 
bases further east, as at Tuzla and Skopje, where they are less 
dangerous and less expensive for you? 
  [Cianfanelli] If you permit me, it is not NATO which is 
moving further east. In the Balkans NATO is intervening under 
UN mandate. And, if anything, it is the East European countries 
who are queuing up to be allowed into NATO. 
  [Mladic] I do not want to go into politics. But I can say 
that in Italy you are not fortunate in having Aviano and Ancona 
[NATO bases] on your territory. For you, moving these bases 
further east would certainly be an advantage. As to NATO's 
intentions, let me insist sincerely. You in Italy are wrong, 
and the longer you take in realizing this, the more it will cost 
you. 
  [Cianfanelli] With the same sincerity I can assure you that 
in Italy there are at least two generations who think that, if 
Italy defeated communism and did not slip into communism, but is 
free and, despite everything which needs to be changed, has made 
enormous progress, and if also the great fraud of socialism in 
the East has collapsed, we owe this to NATO. 
  [Mladic] How then do you explain, if NATO is not 
expansionist, the NATO attack on Gorazde? And the support which 
NATO, together with the United Nations, continues to give to the 
Muslims and the Croats? No, frankly, I am not convinced. 
  [Cianfanelli] Thank you for your frankness, which is always 
the basis of friendship. You have already said that in Bosnia 
there is a need to achieve a political and not a military 
solution, but meanwhile the war, with deaths and devastation, 
continues. When will there be a political solution? 
  [Mladic] This does not depend on the Serbian people. It 
depends on the gods of war, who, following the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia, have not yet reached their objectives in the 
Balkans. Unfortunately, for the immediate future, I am not 
optimistic.

<F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova: "41st Socialist Party Congress </F>
Ends"] 
  [Text] Sofia, June 6 (BTA) -- Zhan Videnov was reelected 
chairman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) by secret ballot 
at its 41st Congress. The voting continued all night and part 
of the day today. Of 688 votes 640 were for Videnov. DUMA, the 
BSP daily, reported the news on its front page two hours before 
the voting had actually started. Several copies of the 
newspaper, circulated in the congress hall shortly after 
midnight, gave the news much to the surprise of some MP's and 
above all of Aleksandur Marinov, considered an alternative 
candidate for the leadership. 
  The highlights of the 41st Congress are calls for early 
parliamentary elections and for the BSP in office. The congress 
lasted one night and one day more than had been scheduled. 
While the counting of the votes for supreme leadership was 
still in progress, the delegates broke into song and had a 
national dance. "We are rehearsing for the jubilation on 
election night in the autumn," a delegate cried. Leader Zhan 
Videnov joined in the dance. 
  The top leadership of the anti-communist Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS), which has been pressing for early elections for 
over a year, held an extraordinary meeting today. "It was 
interesting for us to see the Communist Party adopt a major idea 
upheld by the SDS," SDS leader Filip Dimitrov told the press 
later on. In his view, all major political forces and 
institutions have recognized the need of parliamentary elections 
in the autumn. 
  Proceedings at the congress were smooth. Most delegates 
backed the party leadership. The only issue to provoke debates 
was whether a party programme should be adopted at the congress, 
or by an all- party consultation in September. Quite a few 
delegates insisted on the first option but the majority voted 
for the second one. The congress adopted the basic principles 
of a party programme, a draft election platform and a new 
statute. 
  In the draft election platform the Socialists declare 
themselves in favour of national consensus, against ethnic 
confrontation, for Bulgaria's single-nation character and 
territorial integrity. They will be applying a new economic 
reform model, including a comprehensive policy of social 
protection, socially-oriented mass privatization, halting the 
decline in output, reduction of unemployment, returning the land 
to its former owners and setting up farmer cooperatives on a 
voluntary basis. The BSP calls for goodneighbourly relations 
with all Balkan countries, active and independent policy, 
absolute neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration 
into the European structures. 
  The congress voted a resolution proposed by delegates from 
Kurdzhali, Khaskovo and Smolyan (southeastern Bulgaria, a region 
populated predominantly by ethnic Turks). The BSP will oppose 
by legal means parties and movements which act counter to the 
national interests and security and try to forcibly Turkicize 
Bulgarians professing Islam, the resolution says. 
  In another resolution the congress condemned the court 
trials 
of former communist state officials, charged with plunging the 
country into an economic crisis, calling the trials "political." 
The Socialists will make efforts to rehabilitate Georgi 
Atanasov and Stoyan Ovcharov, respectively prime minister and 
minister of economics under Zhivkov. 
  Many asked how much it cost to hold the well-organized forum 
in the most prestigious convention centre, Sofia's National 
Palace of Culture. The BSP Press Office said the three 
scheduled days of the congress had cost 750,000 leva and all 
MP's of the BSP (about 100) had donated 5,000 leva each towards 
the congress. According to staff members of the convention 
centre, however, the rate for the largest congress hall is 
300,000 leva per day which, added to the cost of materials 
printed on glossy paper, of the hall where briefings were held, 
and refreshments for the delegates, brings the total to about 4 
million leva, sources outside the BSP said. 
  The congress reelected Stefan Prodev editor-in-chief of the 
DUMA daily. Asked by delegates to account for the premature 
report on Videnov's election as leader, Prodev said it was based 
on polls by the press -- an answer which satisfied the delegates.

  [Text] Sofia, June 5 (BTA) -- At a late-night session 
yesterday the 41st congress of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) approved a draft programme entitled "New Times, New 
Bulgaria, New BSP", which will form a basis for the party's 
programme. It will be further developed and the final version 
will be submitted for all-party consultations in the autumn 
prior to its adoption, the congress decided after heated debates. 
  The congress also adopted the basis for a BSP election 
platform and assigned the Supreme Council to revise the draft 
bringing it "in line with the ideas and prospects of a 
left-of-centre agreement". 
  "Bulgaria is heading for early parliamentary elections in 
the 
grip of a grave economic and social crisis," says the draft 
election platform approved at the congress. The final version 
of the document will be drawn up for the new elections. The 
party sets itself three aims for the post-election period: to 
create a new climate in political and social life, to apply a 
new economic reform model, and follow a comprehensive policy of 
social protection of the population. In his report to the 
congress BSP leader Zhan Videnov spoke in favour of the same 
goals. 
  According to the draft platform, the Socialists are in 
favour 
of national consensus, against ethnic confrontation, for 
Bulgaria's single-nation character and territorial integrity. 
They support socially-oriented mass privatization and will work 
to halt the drop in output, to reduce unemployment and return 
the land to its former owners, after which land plots will be 
consolidated through voluntary cooperatives. 
  The BSP is in favour of goodneighbourly relations with all 
Balkan countries, for an active and independent policy, absolute 
neutrality in the Yugoconflict and total integration into the 
European structures. 
  The draft document covers aspects of social life, including 
crime control, the reform of the judiciary and the welfare of 
young people. 
  The draft programme approved at the congress was prepared by 
the Centre for Strategic Studies headed by Alexander Lilov. An 
ad hoc committee under BSP leader Zhan Videnov made additions to 
the draft document. It describes the BSP as "a mass party of 
labour, intelligence, initiative and creativity". As a national 
party the BSP declares itself in favour of ethnic tolerance 
within the unified Bulgarian state. BSP policy is based on 
social democracy, a resolution on the draft programme says. 
  The Socialists will work for the evolutionary modernization 
of Bulgarian society and state that they are open to valuable 
and progressive philosophical and political achievements of 
modern science and civilization. Different ideological trends 
coexist freely in an atmosphere of tolerance in the BSP, the 
draft programme says. 
  The Credentials Committee reported, however, that only 30 of 
nearly 800 delegates represented ideological trends distinct 
from the mainstream. 
  The motion of the ad hoc committee that the programme be 
adopted in the autumn provoked heated debates in an otherwise 
smooth proceeding. Many speakers urged that the congress adopt 
the programme. The motion for an all-party consultation was 
carried by 310 votes to 221. 
  Speaking to BTA reporters, the author of the draft Alexander 
Lilov ruled out the possibility of great changes to it in the 
next three months. It was on these grounds that delegates voted 
against the all-party consultation. Lilov said he had voted for 
it and declined to explain what he had in mind when he said from 
the rostrum that it was against the interests of some circles in 
the party leadership to adopt a new programme. 
  Today the delegates decided that congresses will be convened 
once in four years. According to the new statute, the congress 
will elect a new Supreme Council. From among its members it 
will elect a new leader, controlling committee and 
editors-in-chief of the BSP "Douma" daily and the "Novo Vreme" 
journal. The congress accepted Andrei Loukanov's motion that 
the chairman of the controlling committee should be elected by 
the committee itself and not by the congress. According to the 
statute under discussion, the BSP symbols are a red flag with 
the acronym BSP, a red rose and a five-pointed star. 
  For the first time the statute envisages that the Supreme 
Council will include one delegate from every constituency, 
elected at a general meeting of the chairpersons of the local 
party councils. 
  The congress, continuing behind closed doors late into the 
night, will elect Supreme Council and leader by secret ballot. 
There are two likely candidates for this position: Zhan 
Videnov and Alexander Marinov, leader of the Sofia party 
organization. Former leader Alexander Lilov, now strategist of 
the party, strongly denied having ambitions for the post. Most 
observers and delegates see Videnov as the more likely choice.

  [Text] Sofia, June 6 (BTA) -- "The BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party] is in favour of early parliamentary elections in the 
autumn of 1994. Parliament in its present composition has 
exhausted its law-making potential, its political and moral 
prestige. A new vote by the electorate is the only democratic 
and nationally responsible way to stabilize power in Bulgaria," 
says a political resolution adopted at the 41st Congress of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party, which ended here late this afternoon. 
  The resolution points out that the crisis in this country is 
deepening and parliamentary elections and urgent economic 
measures are needed to guarantee the transition. The congress 
praised the work of the Supreme Party Council, the All-Party 
Controlling Committee and the MP's of the BSP during the period 
between the two congresses. 
  "The main new thing proposed at the congress is the 
readiness 
for change that we will try to impress on the Bulgarians," BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov told a briefing after his reelection. He 
described the forum as extremely successful. Videnov also said 
the congress had clearly mapped out the immediate political 
tasks for the months until the end of the year which, in his 
view, can determine the course of Bulgaria's transition. 
  The congress elected a 106-member Supreme Council and an 
All- 
Party Controlling Committee. BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva 
said the leaders and other members of all ideological trends are 
represented in the leadership. Twenty-eight members of the 
Supreme Party Council are MP's, Mrs. Ananieva told the press. 
The Social Democracy Alliance is represented by fewer members 
than it was before the congress: four of its most prominent 
members were not elected to the Supreme Council. Former prime 
minister Andrey Lukanov was not elected to it either.

<F P=106> [From BTA's 7 June "Press Review"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, June 7 (BTA) -- The 41st Congress of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP, the former Communists), which 
ended here yesterday [6 June], is highlighted in all dailies. 
It opened on Friday [3 June] and went on for one night and one 
day beyond the scheduled time. Zhan Videnov was reelected 
leader and a new statute was adopted. The congress decided that 
the BSP programme will be adopted after an all-party 
consultation in the autumn and passed a resolution urging for 
early parliamentary elections this autumn. A banner headline in 
DUMA, the BSP daily, says that it had predicted that Videnov 
would lead the party to elections in the autumn. Yesterday, 
even before the start of the voting procedure, a front-page 
headline in DUMA announced that Videnov remained socialist 
leader. The story specified that this was a prediction by the 
press. "Other dailies ran similar 'scandalous' headlines 
yesterday," DUMA says. Under the headline "If You Fight Battles 
of the Past, You Live in the Past" the daily runs an interview 
with Zhan Videnov, who says the main steps of the BSP will be to 
complete "what we have prepared, paid for dearly and actually 
finalized in law-making and in our relationships with the 
government" and to guarantee "free, fair and democratic 
elections in an atmosphere of stability, needed for a mandate 
for stable and successful left-of-centre government". The 
leftist daily ZEMYA, the trade union TRUD daily and the private 
NOVINAR also run interviews with Videnov. DUMA publishes 
declarations adopted at the congress and lists the names of the 
members of the newly-elected 106-member Supreme Council, 
including 31 delegates from the constituencies, as well as of 
the All-Party Controlling Committee. The socialist daily 
stresses that in a resolution adopted at the congress the BSP 
expressed readiness for parliamentary elections in the autumn. 
Asked to be more specific about the timing of elections, BSP 
floor leader Nora Ananieva said, "The astronomical end of the 
autumn is December 22" according to DUMA. 
  DEMOKRATSIYA, the daily of the opposition Union of 
Democratic 
Forces (SDS), covers the BSP congress under the headline 
"Videnov Appointed BSP Chief". Associate Editor Mikhaela 
Vuzharova comments: "The Socialists voted to make autumn 'a 
base' for a future date for the early elections; for the time 
being the Socialists make out that the autumn ends on 
Christmas". According to the author, Videnov, now BSP chairman, 
wants to become BSP leader. "The renamed Communists no longer 
shout `BSP', `Victory' or `Unity' and are not convulsed in 
hysteria at the mention of the SDS," the author says. 
  ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME, the daily of the most influential 
extraparliamentary Agrarian Party, headed by Anastasiya 
Dimitrova- Mozer, runs a brief report on the congress headlined 
"They Are Still the Same". 
  "One after the other Socialist leaders speak about elections 
in autumn, but which autumn do they have in mind?" says a signed 
commentary in TRUD. 
  The private KONTINENT daily carries two signed commentaries 
on the BSP congress. One of them stresses that Videnov was the 
only candidate for the leadership and won "against himself". 
"BSP Makes Painful Step to Power" runs the headline of the 
second commentary. 
  The Social Democracy Alliance, a wing of the BSP, lost 
ground 
in the supreme body, says a front-page story in OTECHESTVEN 
VESTNIK. "It, however, won a leader in the person of Videnov," 
the daily says. The private EXPRESS daily, which resumed 
publishing under a new editor-in-chief, says the non-conformists 
were thrown out of the BSP Supreme Council. These are 
Aleksandur Marinov, leader of the Sofia party organization, 
considered an alternative candidate for the position of leader, 
and ex-premier Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Velislava Dureva 
and Elena Poptodorova, all four of them members of the Social 
Democracy Alliance. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sofia, June 8 (BTA) -- The Partnership for Peace 
Programme is called upon to ensure greater security for all 
regions of Europe at the same time, President Zhelyu Zhelev said 
in a speech before the Atlantic Club tonight. Dr. Zhelev is a 
member of the Honorary Board of Directors and a founder member 
of the Atlantic Club, established in 1991. Every year since 
then he has given a lecture on Bulgaria's foreign policy to 
diplomats, Bulgarian politicians and public figures. "The 
programme is not intended to divide Europe again; on the 
contrary, it removes `grey' and `buffer' zones, often subject to 
demagogic praise as regions of the so-called `absolute 
neutrality,'" the Bulgarian president said. 
  Present-day Bulgaria sees its place among the European 
democracies, in the civilized free world, President Zhelev said. 
He stressed that integration into the European and 
Euro-Atlantic economic structures and security systems gives 
scope to Bulgarian national interests and reduces to the maximum 
the danger of a relapse into unilateral dependence or a 
reversion to familiar doctrines of limited sovereignty. 
President Zhelev recalled that Bulgaria's policy of moderation, 
stability, balanced relations and pragmatism is blazing the way 
for modern international relations in the Balkan part of Europe. 
He expressed certainty that "finally it (Bulgaria's policy) 
would be assessed on its merits." 
  President Zhelev said Partnership for Peace was of 
indisputable importance for the new Eastern democracies. These 
ideas are in harmony with the interests of Bulgaria, which has 
been making tremendous efforts for several years now to change 
the nature of regional interstate relations and has been doing 
its best to set them on the track of good-neighbourly relations, 
cooperation, stable development, gradual opening of the borders 
and real integration into the rest of Europe, Dr. Zhelev 
stressed. He said the programme would help "clean the Augean 
stables" of the legacy of suspicions and prejudice. It may help 
to prevent the worst danger for the Balkans, the emergence of 
all kinds of regional alliances -- "Orthodox or Pan-Slavic 
axes," "an arc or crescent of Islam" -- formations which 
historically preceded and lead up to Balkan wars and 
catastrophes, Dr. Zhelev stressed. 
  According to the president, Partnership for Peace can fill 
the vacuum in regional balances created by the breakup of the 
Warsaw Pact and by the non-accession of some Balkan states to 
European disarmament treaties. He recalled Bulgaria is 
surrounded by military superior neighbours and that imbalances 
tend to be growing. Therefore this country is especially 
interested in a mutually acceptable levels of the different 
components of the military balance and in transparency and 
predictability in the implementation of the Conventional Forces 
in Europe Treaty, Dr. Zhelev emphasized. 
  Understanding of Partnership for Peace would be incomplete 
if 
it is viewed only in the field of military cooperation, the 
president said. According to him, the initiative may have an 
impact on the reform in the Bulgarian Army, in the defence 
sector and Bulgaria's defence potential. He named social 
security, the combatting of organized crime, narcotics 
trafficking and smuggling as other fields of cooperation within 
Partnership for Peace. 
  Bulgaria sees a chance for cooperation with NATO in the 
training of specialized troops for missions under the auspices 
of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), said the president. He recalled 
that within the framework of the Partnership for Peace, the 
Bulgarian Defence Ministry is preparing an international 
military exercise Breeze '94 to be attended by battleship of 
U.S. 6th Fleet, Turkey, Greece, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, and 
Bulgaria, and observers from Georgia. Close cooperation with 
NATO is a prerequisite for the reform in the Bulgarian Army and 
for ensuring a proper place for the Bulgarian military in a 
democratic civil society, the president said in conclusion.

  [Text] Sofia, June 8 (BTA) -- The leader of Macedonia's 
Human Rights Party, Bulgarian citizen Ilija Ilievski, said today 
that during the upcoming census in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from June 21 to July 5 
Bulgarians there will be deprived of the right to freely express 
their national identity. At a press conference here, Ilievski 
said the census will take place in the conditions of continuing 
systematic violations of the human rights of citizens of 
Bulgarian nationality and its results will not be objective and 
reliable. 
  The leader of this opposition party outlawed by Macedonia's 
Supreme Court in January said the questionnaires for the census 
did not contain "Bulgarian nationality" as an option. He also 
said this year's census will violate the major document of the 
UN Economic and Social Council saying such censuses should take 
place in a year ending in 0 or 5. 
  Ilievski discussed his Geneva visit from June 1 to 3 and 
said 
he briefed on these matters the International Conference on 
Former Yugoslavia, the UN Commission on Human Rights and 
international nongovernmental human rights groups.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 Jun (MTI) -- "The prime minister of the 
new Hungarian government should meet with the Slovak Prime 
Minister at the earliest possible date," runs a message to 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik from Gyula Horn, the 
chairman and prime minister candidate of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP). The message was presented to the Slovak Premier 
in Bratislava on Wednesday by MSZP acting Deputy Chairman Imre 
Szekeres. 
  In an interview with MTI's correspondent after the hour-long 
meeting with Moravcik, Szekeres said: 
  "The meeting was extremely constructive. I detailed the 
probable essentials of the foreign policy of the new Hungarian 
government: that we shall strive for European integration, for 
settling our relations with neighbouring countries, and for 
ensuring the rights of the Hungarian minority living outside the 
borders of Hungary". 
  "I also said that though the new government will be the 
government of 10.5 million Hungarians, it will feel 
responsibility for the fate of the Hungarian minority living 
beyond the country's borders." 
  "We consider it important to open talks on the basic 
agreement between the two countries as soon as possible, and for 
these to lead to success as early as possible." 
  "There are two major issues from our point of view: 
recognizing the inviolability of the borders, and mutual 
ensurance of the rights of Hungarians in Slovakia and Slovaks in 
Hungary." 
  "I also informed Prime Minister Moravcik that the new 
Hungarian government will hold talks about the debated issues of 
the Gabcikovo power plant on a professional, rather than an 
ideological basis." 
  Jozef Moravcik also met the press. He said he had told the 
MSZP delegation that the Slovak Government considered the 
election manifesto of the Hungarian socialists very interesting, 
"as it holds out the promise of successful bilateral 
cooperation." "We agreed that the foreign policy concepts of 
our countries are identical as regards basic aims, but that 
settling bilateral relations now requires firmer steps," 
Moravcik said.

  [Text] Budapest, 8 June (MTI) -- "The new Socialist-led 
government should not expect any days of grace as there are too 
many problems to solve," Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialist party's 
top economic expert, said in Wednesday's [8 June] issue of the 
economic and financial daily NAPI GAZDASAG. The Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) won an absolute majority in the May 
general elections. 
  "First, we have to try to stop financial balances from 
critically deteriorating in 1994," he said, adding that inland 
economic processes provide little chance for this. A 
supplementary budget should be presented to the new Parliament 
in order to prevent deficits from exceeding the level already 
expected for 1994, Bekesi added. 
  The financial expert deemed it even more important to halt a 
further deficit increase in the country's current payment 
budget. "The situation is rather critical. This year's deficit 
is expected to amount to $3-4 billion," he said. 
  It would not be expedient to raise or lower the real value 
of 
the forint, Bekesi said. However, its nominal revaluation is a 
different matter. Since the forint is regularly revaluated due 
to the gap between Hungarian inflation and the inflation in 
other countries belonging to the currency basket, the nominal 
devaluation of the forint is unavoidable. But it will not reach 
the 10-20 percent rate rumored by the press, he told NAPI 
GAZDASAG. 
  Privatization should be made more effective, with techniques 
which completely stop or alter further frauds, Bekesi said. 
Moreover, capital-raising privatization should be launched which 
primarily concerns banks and major public utility works. The 
new government aims to increase investments by a more favorable 
taxation system, Bekesi said. 
  Regarding agriculture tasks, the economics expert said that 
smashing up cooperatives should be ceased. Privatization must 
be completed as soon as possible, and the economic and legal 
foundations of uniting an atomized ownership structure should be 
laid. Sensible measures need to be implemented which protect 
the interests of the agricultural market, and are not 
discriminatory against Hungary's obligations undertaken in 
agreements with the European Union (EU) and the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Bekesi said. 
  The acceleration of concessions for major infrastructure 
projects (i.e. motorway and railway construction, and 
telecommunications) would also result in economic growth, Bekesi 
continued. Hungary's economy would be promoted if it were to 
open up again towards Eastern European markets, obviously 
beginning with barters, he said. 
  "The new government wishes to improve conditions for direct 
foreign investment. Here we consider re-establishing normative 
tax allowances, Bekesi said. We intend to liberalize the 
purchase of real estate -- excluding land -- to enable 
foreigners to purchase flats, houses, or shops in Hungary. The 
same measures cannot be applied to arable land as there is no 
market for land, therefore current land prices are not 
realistic." 
  Bekesi also said that he deemed it expedient to revise 
certain points in the association agreement between Hungary and 
the EU. "The conditions set forth in the agreement for Hungary's 
agricultural, textile, steel, and metallurgical products are 
unfavorable, nor does the agreement cover conditions for a free 
flow of the work force; instead it leaves regulation of the 
issue up to bilateral agreements. These are the points that 
will surely have to be rediscussed. Additionally, conditions 
for penetration into the international market should be also 
improved," Bekesi told NAPI GAZDASAG.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 Jun (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist 
Party's (MSZP) senior economic expert, Laszlo Bekesi, and the 
managing faction leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), Gabor Kuncze, agreed that the preparations for the 1996 
World Expo in Budapest must continue, but that all required 
financial conditions must be guaranteed. Coalition talks 
between the two parties began on Tuesday. 
  The Expo will be more modest than initially targeted since 
the original plan of its financing from business sources has 
been aborted, Bekesi said to the daily NEPSZABADSAG. 
  When the Expo project came into being, the Antall government 
did not specify the concessions and ownership rights the 
investors would be entitled to. It also failed to specify the 
rights of utilisation of the territory and buildings after the 
Expo, Bekesi said. 
  These oversights cannot be repaired now because of the lack 
of time before the opening of the Expo. As a consequence, the 
Expo, which requires 100-120 billion forints, can be financed 
only from budget sources, he said, adding that the 30 billion 
forints which has already been allocated by Parliament for the 
Expo would not cover the costs of even the most basic 
investments. According to Bekesi, the new government will not 
revise the plan of the Expo, but due to financial limitations 
the Expo will be more modest than was originally conceived. 
  Kuncze told NEPSZABADSAG that the Expo must be organised if 
the deadline can be met and if the event can be financed. 
  Although the amount allocated by Parliament is not enough, 
more than 20 billion forints has already been spent on Expo 
preparations over the past three years. Among others, bond 
issues and real estate constructions have begun, and 24 
countries have officially announced their participation. As a 
result, the Expo cannot be cancelled now even if every sign 
indicates that it will operate at a loss, Kuncze said. 
  If the SZDSZ is in a decision-making position, the party 
will 
recommend modification of the system of implementation and 
execution, since present preparations do not meet legal 
stipulations, Kuncze added.

  [Text] Budapest, 9 June (MTI) -- The National Presidium of 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party in the 
outgoing government coalition, met on Wednesday [8 June] evening 
to elect a new acting Presidium, spokesman Karoly Herenyi said 
late on Wednesday. 
  On Wednesday evening, the acting Presidium of the MDF 
presented its resignation to the National Presidium, which 
accepted it. MDF acting chairman Sandor Lezsak had resigned a 
week earlier. 
  Instead of a new acting chairman, the National Presidium 
chose to give the chair to a five-strong acting Presidium until 
the next, unscheduled National Convention. The five are Laszlo 
Salamon, Laszlo Medgyasszai, Ivan Szabo, Geza Jeszenszky, and 
Zoltan Bogardi. 
  Herenyi said that no members of the former acting Presidium 
have applied to be reelected. Thus neither Sandor Lezsak, nor 
the five deputy chairpersons of the Presidium (Prime Minister 
Peter Boross, Peter Nahimi, Gabriella Farkas, Ferenc Kulin, 
Tamas Szabo) stayed in their posts. The five on the new acting 
Presidium are all equal in rank. The date of the next, 
unscheduled National Convention will be set at the July session 
of the National Board.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 8 -- The documents handed to President 
Lech Walesa by Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his 
official Polish visit in August 1993 do not contain files of the 
Committee of State Security (KGB) on the Solidarity trade union 
movement leaders, the presidential press office has told the 
Polish Press Agency (PAP). This information is connected with 
the recently-published book of Boris Yeltsin suggesting that he 
had given Walesa the KGB files. Last month, President Walesa 
told the "Wiadomosci" main TV news bulletin that the suggestions 
included in the book are a misunderstanding. 
  In August 1993, Yeltsin gave Walesa the copies of the 
archival documentation of the so-called Suslov commission on the 
introduction of martial law in Poland in 1981. In 1993, the 
eight documents were published in Poland in the book "The 
Documents -- The Suslov File." 
  The presidential press office also released the text of a 
conversation between Krakow's radio station "RMF" Moscow 
correspondent Waldemar Gontarski with press spokesman of the 
Russian state committee for Russia's archives Nikolay Berezovski. 
  The latter was asked whether Walesa had published all Suslov 
files and whether there was any evidence against the Polish 
president. Berezowski is quoted as telling Gontarski "why don't 
you believe your president, after all President Boris Yeltsin 
handed over the file to Lech Walesa in the presence of a great 
number of journalists." 
  "As an official representative of the committee for the 
Russian Federation's archives I have grounds to state that 
President Lech Walesa tells the truth when he says that (Walesa) 
has published the complete Suslov file."

  [Text] Warsaw, June 7 -- During the second and last day of 
debates on Poland's eastern policy, Minister for Foreign 
Economic Relations Leslaw Podkanski said that Poland has a 
chance to double its trade with the East by 1997. In order to 
do so however, the minister emphasized that Poland must take up 
a more active economic policy. 
  "We are a few months, if not a few years, late in renewing 
ties with the East," said the minister Tuesday. He stressed 
that one of the major problems lies in the lack of insurance of 
transactions and trade contacts with the states of the former 
USSR. 
  Podkanski further informed the conference that a draft law 
on 
insurance of transactions against political risk has already 
been prepared. However, the issue of mutual indebtedness of 
Poland and Russia still remains unsettled and there is no 
efficient system of settlements, he said. 
  According to Podkanski Poland is behind the Czech Republic 
and Hungary in renewing its economic ties with the former 
communist states. "Poland's policy must be more aggressive," he 
argued stating that Poland's turnover with these countries last 
year amounted to 5 billion U.S. dollars. 
  The minister further declared that the strategic aims and 
assumptions of Poland's eastern economic policy centre above all 
on Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and, next 
on the Baltic states. 
  According to chairman of the world trade and finance centre 
for the East Jaroslaw Mulewicz any programme of economic 
cooperation with Russia should embrace several decades since the 
process of reforms cannot be expected to be completed earlier. 
  Mulewicz also pointed to the threat of "Russification" of 
the 
Polish economy, namely of adopting bad examples of the Russian 
economy. In order to avoid this it is necessary to create a 
clear system of competition, he said. In his opinion the West's 
policy of concessions towards Russia is wrong. He stressed that 
part of the assistsnce funds allocated to Russia are being 
deposited on private bank accounts. 
  Participants in the conference also familiarized themselves 
with the assumptions of the partnership for development 
programme conceived as a complementary programme to the 
Partnership for Peace plan. The programme designed to support 
economic cooperation, restructuring processes and adjustment to 
Western structures would cover the countries of the Central 
European Free Trade Zone (CEFTA) and other Central European 
states as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States. The 
CEFTA states would play the role of a bridge between the East 
and the West, it was stressed. 
  The conference also discussed on Tuesday the question of 
Polish community in Kazakhstan. According to chairman of the 
Polish community association Andrzej Stelmachowski Poland should 
prepare a long-range plan for repatriation of Poles from 
Kazakhstan. In the opinion of the Polish Foreign Ministry the 
decision on the issue of repatriation should be taken by the 
government. 
  Marek Nowakowski of the government foundation of assistance 
to Poles living in the East argued that it was necessary to 
create not a plan of repatriation but rather a programme of 
education and scholarships for Poles from Kazakhstan. According 
to the Foreign Ministry's data some 70,000 Poles living in 
Kazakhstan (70 per cent) want to return to Poland.

  [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- Slovak Foreign Minister 
Eduard Kukan today confirmed Bratislava's rejection of the 
recommendation by a European Union expert commission that more 
water be diverted into the old course of the River Danube and 
less into the canal that serves the hydroelectric power project 
at Gabcikovo-Nagymaros. 
  The recommendation was intended as a compromise in the 
Slovak-Hungarian dispute over what water regime should be 
adopted until the International Court at The Hague delivers its 
judgement about the disputed hydroelectric project. 
  The Hungarian Parliament agreed with the experts' 
recommendations, but decided to supply the branches of the river 
which are drying up by means of pumps rather than by building 
weirs. 
  Kukan said in a radio interview that the commission's 
recommendation to increase the flow in the old Danube course by 
800 cubic metres a second "is not acceptable to the Slovak 
Government". He said there were other technical measures which 
might permit a different compromise solution with Hungary and 
Bratislava wanted to discuss them. 
  "We have certain positive signs that the Hungarian position 
might be changing, but I would be realistic and wait and see 
what actually happens," Kukan said. He said he assumed talks 
would continue after the new Hungarian Government was formed.

  [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- The bilingual names of 
towns and villages, where at least one-fifth of residents are 
ethnic Hungarians, could be introduced by an Interior Ministry 
regulation, chairman of the ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles movement 
Miklos Duray said today. Speaking at a press conference, he was 
commenting on the rejection of the place name bill by the Slovak 
Parliament on June 3. 
  Egyutteles deputies pointed to the statement made by Premier 
Jozef Moravcik on Monday [6 June] that tomorrow coalition talks 
would decide on the further fate of the "place name" bill. They 
said that it is possible that a new deputies' bill could be 
presented and discussed by parliament in June or July. 
  With the law rejected, one of Slovakia's commitments to the 
Council of Europe still remains unfulfilled. Although the 
government coalition, backed by ethnic Hungarian parties, has a 
clear majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for the 
bill, while 61 were against and six abstained. A single vote 
was missing for the bill to be rejected. [as received] Two 
Egyutteles deputies abstained from the vote, and one even voted 
against. 
  Miklos Feher, one of the above three Hungarian deputies, 
insisted that on the very day of the vote representatives of 
ethnic Hungarian groups of deputies (those of Egyutteles and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, MKDH, which have 9 and 
5 members respectively in the 150-seat parliament) agreed on 
behalf of their groups not to support the bill if a proposal by 
an independent deputy that villages named after figures from 
Slovak history be not allowed to bear Hungarian names was 
accepted. 
  A law in such a compromise form would be "discriminatory and 
anti-democratic", Feher said. The towns and villages in 
southern Slovakia were named after significant Slovak figures 
only after February 1948 (the communist putsch in 
Czechoslovakia) and their present names are the expression of 
"cruel re-Slovakisation", and have no historical ground, he 
added. Feher stressed that the ethnic Hungarian deputies, who 
had decided to back the bill, had changed their opinion "five 
minutes before the vote". 
  Deputy Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, who had voted in favour of the 
bill, said that not only Hungarian deputies were to be blamed 
for the result of the vote. "The roots of the failure must be 
sought in the government coalition," he said. Besides the 
absence of twelve coalition deputies and the fact that three 
coalition representatives did not support the bill, the negative 
result was also due to the "unfulfilled promise by the 
coalition", which failed to prevent the adoption of proposals 
for changes deforming the initial government bill.

  [Text] Bratislava June 6 (CTK) -- Imrich Kruzliak, whose 
recent statement as an external adviser to the Slovak president 
that the Czech Republic should recognise Sudeten Germans' right 
to homeland, has aroused a great response, believes that the 
Germans should acquire this right as a "moral satisfaction." He 
made the former statement at the Sudeten German congress held in 
Nuremberg in mid-May. The latter statement he made in an 
interview with CTK. 
  "I wish the Sudeten Germans gain understanding on all sides 
and acquire the right to their homeland," Kruzliak told CTK. "It 
is impossible either to blame Sudeten Germans for the Munich 
Agreement or condemn them on the principle of collective guilt. 
Not only the Landsmannschaft but also official German 
representatives require a solution to the problem," he stated. 
  "The older generations are dying out. They will not return 
to the Czech Lands. The young people apparently have no strong 
relation to the Czech Republic," Kruzliak commented on the Czech 
fears of the return of Sudeten Germans to the Czech Lands. "None 
of them insist on the revision of borders," he said, adding that 
the question of Sudeten German rights to homeland could be 
settled by a sort of ethnic minority rights codex, whose 
adoption is being considered by the Council of Europe, the 
United Nations and the European Union (EU). 
  "I would be glad if Czech journalists found the courage to 
admit the truth about history," Kruzliak said in reaction to 
"distorted information" in the press, which pointed to his 
presence in Nuremberg. He resolutely denied the idea that the 
statement he had made in Nuremberg on Sudeten German rights was 
a call for the abolition of the Benes Decrees (providing for the 
transfer of Sudeten Germans from Czechoslovakia after World War 
Two). "The Benes Decrees cannot be simply cast off," he said. 
  "I was invited to the (Nuremberg) congress as a private 
person," Kruzliak stressed. He added that Sudeten German leader 
Franz Neubauer had introduced him as an adviser to the Slovak 
president by error. 
  "I am nearing my eighties and I wanted to use the 
opportunity 
to thank the Landsmannschaft (SL) for its support from the time 
of the communist oppression and for the presentation of SL's 
European Charles Prize to the former Chairman of the World 
Congress of Slovaks Stefan Roman in 1986," Kruzliak explained. 
  He described as "ridiculous" the information by the Czech 
left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO that he and Neubauer embraced and 
kissed. "This is not usual in the West. We always used to laugh 
at the kisses exchanged between former East German and Russian 
top leaders (Erich) Honecker and (Leonid) Brezhnev," added 
Kruzliak, who lived in emigration for 40 years. 
  Jan Klepac, who is in charge of the staff of external 
advisors and consultants of Slovak President Michal Kovac, said 
that the "Slovak Presidential Office does not believe that 
Imrich Kruzliak appeared in Nuremberg on behalf of the head of 
the (Slovak) state, and Kruzliak does not claim such a position." 
  "We should not waste time in discussing the fact that 
somebody quoted Kruzliak as having said something he has never 
said," Klepac commented on Kruzliak's alleged statement on the 
abolition of the Benes Decrees.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 7 (CTK) -- Less than a half of 
Slovak citizens favor the idea of Slovakia's joining NATO, 
according to a poll conducted by the Slovak Statistical Office 
in May. 
  Only 15 percent of those questioned said it was most 
necessary for Slovakia to try to join NATO, while 34 percent 
believed that it was probably necessary. Almost one Slovak out 
of five (18 percent) is afraid and 11 percent are sure that such 
efforts are senseless. 22 percent of those polled did not answer 
the question. 
  If Slovakia became a member of NATO, almost two fifths of 
citizens (37 percent) would expect an improvement in Slovakia's 
defense capability, according to the poll. Four percent of 
Slovaks said they would expect the defense capability to worsen.

  [Text] Bratislava June 7 (CTK) -- Cabinet has approved the 
preliminary list of businesses to be privatised in the second 
wave of coupon privatisation, announced Milan Janicina, the 
privatisation minister. The list contains businesses with 
property valued at 35 billion crowns. 
  In an IMF economic policy memorandum, the Slovak Government 
has undertaken to privatise 500 state enterprises with a book 
value of 220 billion crowns. The memorandum states that 88 
billion crowns worth of property will be privatised through the 
form of coupon privatisation. The preliminary list contains 40 
percent of this amount. 
  Janicina said that of the 53 billion shortfall, the 
government hopes to place 17 billion crowns of property from 
energy and gas companies into coupon privatisation, a further 15 
to 20 billion crowns of shares from the first wave held by the 
National Property Fund, and another ten billion is still being 
discussed by the appropriate ministries. Janicina said that a 
number of businesses that would be privatised through standard 
methods had been excluded from the list. 
  Privatisation of health facilities will be clarified by July 
30. If these facilities do not find specific parties interested 
in their purchase they will also be included in coupon 
privatisation. The definitive list of businesses for the second 
wave will be completed by August 15.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- "The interim Slovak 
Government is proving in practice that reckless privatization is 
characteristic of it. Recklessly, unsystematically, and without 
any clear program it is striving to fill the coupon 
privatization coffers," Ivan Lexa, former state secretary in the 
Privatization Ministry and a "minister" in the shadow cabinet of 
ex-premier Vladimir Meciar today says in the daily SLOVENSKA 
REPUBLIKA, published by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS). 
  Lexa points to the fact that the government failed to 
approve 
Privatization Minister Milan Janicina's proposal according to 
which of the total 190 billion crowns (more than $6 billion) 
worth of the state-owned property put to privatization in the 
second wave, property amounting to 80 billion crowns should be 
privatized through the coupon method. 
  Janicina intends to offer the maximum of state property for 
coupon privatization so as to please his future voters, Lexa 
says, adding that voters will, however, receive nothing of it 
since the "collapsing enterprises bring no profits and the 
prosperous ones are designated for others." 
  He says ``the cream will be licked off by the investment 
privatization funds under which an "indefinite foreign capital 
and maybe dirty money" allegedly hide. [quotation marks as 
received] "For example, the chemical industry, a considerable 
part of the spa and all mines are to be privatized in such a 
way," Lexa asserts. 
  On the other hand, the appearance of the diffused mass of 
anonymous owners without any capital share would necessarily 
lead to collapse, Lexa says, adding that the HZDS had sought to 
provide employees with shares to motivate them as owners. 
  Renowned foreign experts are also expressing ever-growing 
surprise over the course of privatization in Slovakia, Lexa 
says. On the one hand they allegedly rejoice over the 
opportunity to obtain "Slovak factories cheaply," and on the 
other they do not understand an irrational approach by the 
current government, he adds. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Moscow June 9 (CTK) -- Mutual respect of the 
differences between Russia and the Czech Republic is a condition 
of good relations between the two countries, President Vaclav 
Havel said in an interview for the latest edition of the Russian 
weekly MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI. This was his first interview with a 
Russian paper in his capacity as Czech president. 
  "We feel we belong through historical tradition to Europe 
which is called Western. Russia is standing with one foot in 
Europe, but is in Asia with the other, which is a different 
world. I think we must live in friendship, based on a rich 
structure of relationships. I cannot imagine the world without 
this. At the same time, there is no reason to deny the 
difference which exists between us," Havel said, pointing to the 
"evident difference between Russia's spiritual, historical, 
cultural and political world, and that, let us say, our, Central 
European." 
  "I believe that we must respect the specific Russian space, 
but Russia, too, must bear in mind that is up to us to decide on 
where we want to stand," Havel told the paper. 
  "Russia must be a fundamental partner for that Europe which 
is called Western, while Central Europe is striving to be 
considered its part," Havel said. "Of course, local peoples do 
not think that Russia is trying to interfere with our affairs 
more than with those of other states, or that we belong in some 
sphere of interests or influence. This is an unequal position. 
No one can dominate. The relations can be improved only on the 
basis of the principle of total equality. To tell the truth, 
this part of Europe is somewhat disturbed at some voices from 
Russia which seem to suggest that Russia considers us its zone 
of interest, and that it would like to endorse our right to 
enter these or those organisations," Havel stated. 
  On the recent achievements of the left in some Central and 
East European countries, Havel noted that "it does not seem that 
the political pendulum would swing to this side in the Czech 
Republic in the foreseeable future." There are many, also 
historic, causes of this, because "unlike Poland and Hungary, 
there was most conservative communist regime in the Czech 
Republic," Havel said. 
  Havel said he did not consider the shift of power to the 
left 
a signal of the return to communism. "This is simply a symptom 
of a period of democratic development. In some democratic 
countries more left-orientated parties are at power, while 
elsewhere there are more right-orientated parties. I would not 
draw any far-reaching conclusions from this," he added. 
  Regarding the communists' position in the Czech Republic, 
Havel said that at present three parties have succeeded the 
former communists, while "two of them are reform-minded (SDL, 
the Democratic Left Party, and LB, the Left Bloc) and I can 
imagine their normal participation in a democratic system." 
"The third is more conservative, uniting the older, more 
orthodox communists who are not able to relinquish the ideology. 
However, I do not think they could jeopardise democracy," Havel 
said.

  [Text] Prague June 6 (CTK) -- "The Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS) Executive Council confirms that the ODS has supported in 
the past and is unambiguously supporting the establishment of 
the Senate on the majoritarian principle in accordance with the 
Czech Constitution," ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus 
said today. Speaking to journalists during a break in an 
Executive Council meeting, Klaus added that the ODS Deputies' 
Group had proceeded from this principle while discussing the 
bill on the senatorial elections. 
  He said the council had resolutely rejected the 
unsubstantiated statements about a non-constitutional state 
which had allegedly arisen in the Czech Republic. "Nothing of 
the kind is true. I see no signs of the constitutional crisis 
which would justify an urgent need for change in the Czech 
Constitution," Klaus said. 
  He described as a "fully false card produced by some 
political parties" statements about the non-constitutional state 
in the Republic and proposals by some deputies that if the 
Senate is not established some of its powers should be 
transferred to the president. Klaus pointed to the existing 
temporary provisions in the Constitution which "clearly say how 
competences are being divided up to the moment when the Senate 
appears." "We permanently respect the Constitution and the 
majoritarian principle on which the Senate should be set up and 
we believe it will be filled at a proper moment," Klaus said.

  [Text] Prague June 9 (CTK) -- Deputy Chairman of the 
coalition Christian Democratic Party [KDS] Vaclav Benda 
considers speculation about his possible expulsion from the 
party or dismissal as deputy chairman "inflated and 
unrealistic." In an interview with CTK today, Benda said he did 
not believe that by his statement on NOVA Television in which he 
described Augusto Pinochet as a "brave man" he had harmed the 
interests of his party. "Moreover, because of this statement new 
people have joined our party," he said. 
  Benda said he had invited General Pinochet for lunch with 
the 
awareness of the KDS Political Council and that "not one 
objection against such an approach was raised" at a council 
meeting, he added. "When I told the meeting that if I were 
chairman I would recommend a meeting with Pinochet, KDS Chairman 
Ivan Pilip said in a very resolute manner that he was naturally 
also for Pinochet and had no objections whatsoever against such 
a meeting," Benda said, when asked whether he had discussed the 
whole matter with Pilip. 
  Benda said he had realised from the very beginning the 
"political risk of the whole operation" and had chosen such an 
approach out of moral rather than political reasons. He said he 
had expected at least 83-percent disapproval and was pleasantly 
surprised by the extent of support and solidarity he was 
receiving from individuals and organisations. 
  Benda admitted that the KDS Executive Committee would 
discuss 
the matter at its meeting on Saturday and did not rule out that 
some kind of stand would be taken there. He said that the 
course of the meeting would show the level of support he enjoyed 
among KDS members.

  [Text] Plzen, West Bohemia June 9 (CTK) -- Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS) Chairman Ivan Pilip said today he did not 
know the origin of speculation about the possible dismissal of 
KDS Deputy Chairman Vaclav Benda. "But I must say that some of 
Benda's statements disquiet me," Pilip said, adding that these 
statements had harmed the KDS. 
  "I agree that the person of General Pinochet is far more 
complicated than is pictured in some critical media reports 
protesting against his visit to the Czech Republic," Pilip said. 
He added, however, that presently it was necessary to "direct 
attention towards important questions connected with the 
transformation of the economy, health care and the educational 
system and not to provoke speculation as to whether it is 
appropriate to use military methods for solving the situation in 
the country or not." 
  Information that Benda might be removed from his post at a 
KDS Executive Committee meeting on Saturday [11 June] was 
published today by the left-leaning daily RUDE PRAVO. 
  On June 5 Benda told NOVA Television that if he were in the 
same situation as General Augusto Pinochet he would probably act 
in the same way. He added he did not consider Pinochet a 
criminal but a brave man who, through tough means but acting 
against an enemy just as tough, saved his country at the last 
moment from the horrors of communism or a long-lasting civil war.

  [Text] Killarney, June 6 (CTK) -- "The Czech Republic is 
trying to build up a competitive agriculture. Paradoxically, 
this has been prevented by strong protectionist policy of the 
European Union (EU) countries," Agriculture Minister Josef Lux 
told the 19th FAO (U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation) 
regional conference today. 
  Czech agricultural policy is striving for farmers' 
competition in the world markets, but without the excessive 
support by their economies, Lux stated. The Czech Republic will 
participate in the main programmes the conference has defined: 
international agricultural research, application of 
environment-friendly technology, new patterns of food 
consumption and changes in nutrition of the population, Lux 
reported. On Tuesday [7 June] Lux will meet FAO Director General 
Jacques Diouf.

  [Text] Prague June 7 (CTK) -- Parliament has received the 
state budget report for the first quarter of 1994 in which the 
government evaluates overall economic development as 
satisfactory. It maintains that social stability is being 
maintained as well as the confidence of foreign investors. The 
influx of foreign portfolio investment amounted to $200 million 
in the first quarter of 1994. 
  The GDP in constant prices grew in the first quarter at an 
annual rate of between 0.5 and two percent. Industrial 
production was down 0.7 percent compared to the first quarter of 
last year. The volume of production of small businesses with up 
to 24 employees was up 23.7 percent compared to the same period 
of last year. 
  Labour productivity expressed in comparable prices was up 
2.7 
percent in industry over the first quarter of last year. The 
average nominal monthly wage was 13.8 percent higher. 
  Overall production in the construction industry was up 6.2 
percent in the first quarter over the same period of last year, 
which the government primarily attributes to enterprises with 
more than 25 workers. 
  Industrial producer prices were up 6.2 percent over the same 
period of last year. The prices of construction work were up 
16.3 percent and agricultural producer prices were up less than 
two percent. 
  The government considers that price increases were moderate 
at the start of the year and correspond to this year's inflation 
forecast of eight to ten percent. Consumer prices rose by 2.4 
percent over the first quarter and by 10 percent compared to the 
same period of last year. Inflationary pressures were gentle 
and corresponded to the growth of demand during a revival of 
economic output. Wage cost inflationary pressures were 
insignificant with regard to the operation of wage regulation. 
  National income was 163 billion crowns in the first quarter. 
Compared to the same period of last year this represents a 
nominal growth of 26 percent and a real growth of 15 percent. 
Nominal incomes from wages grew 14 percent, four percent in 
real terms. Other incomes, the crucial component of which being 
incomes from business activities, increased by 50 percent in 
nominal terms, 37 percent in real terms. Incomes from state 
benefits increased by 30 percent in nominal terms and 18 percent 
in real terms. 
  The population had a net income of 19.6 billion crowns, 
which 
it used to repay loans (1.1 billion crowns), increase its 
holding of financial securities (0.8 billion), increase bank 
deposits (12.7 billion), and increase liquidity (five billion).

  [Text] Prague June 7 (CTK) -- Czech trade during the first 
quarter was at a deficit of 2.1 billion crowns [Kc], and after 
four months the deficit diminished to 1.5 billion crowns, 
according to a government budget report that was given to 
parliament recently. 
  Czech export to advanced market economies increased by nine 
percent in the first quarter over the same period last year. 
Czech exports to Slovakia decreased by 22 percent to 15.5 
percent. Exports to former Soviet countries dropped from six to 
five percent, and to countries with transitional economies, from 
6.3 to 5.9 percent. 
  The share of machines and consumer goods was nearly 40 
percent, and the export of raw materials increased the most 
rapidly (from 6.6 to 9.8 percent). Overall, exports decreased 
by 5.6 percent (5.2 billion crowns) in the first quarter against 
the first quarter last year, and by 6.5 percent (8.2 billion 
crowns) during the first four months of 1994 in the same 
year-on-year comparison. 
  Imports in the first three months of 1994 increased by 18 
percent (almost 14 billion crowns), and by 11 percent in the 
first four months (11.6 billion crowns). Imports from advanced 
economies increased (by four percent) as well as from countries 
with transforming economies and from former Soviet states. 
Slovakia's share in Czech imports decreased from 21 to 15 
percent. Export prices grew by 2.5 percent, and import prices 
by only half a percent. 
  The surplus on the current account was at the same level as 
in the first quarter of 1993, and the surplus on the capital 
account of the payments balance was $350 million larger. 
Overall hard currency reserves were $700 million higher than in 
the first quarter last year.

  [Text] Prague June 8 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today 
approved the debt repayment agreement with Russia closed on May 
30 by the Czech deputy finance minister, Premier Vaclav Klaus 
told journalists after a cabinet meeting. The agreement 
concerns the repayment of $3.5 billion of Russian debts to the 
Czech Republic by the year 2003. 
  "The Government considers this agreement to be a remarkable 
success and is content with this one bird in the hand, for the 
two fat ones weren't so much in the bush as up in the clouds," 
said Klaus. He mentioned the fact that the Czech negotiators 
had succeeded in fixing the amount of the debt, interest rate 
conditions, an exact term of specific repayments, and a 
one-to-one exchange rate of the rouble to the dollar. 
  Klaus specified that the agreement means the Czech Republic 
will receive $52 million this year, $101 million the next and 
$391 million in 1996. He said that it had been clear from his 
April meeting with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in Moscow 
that the debt would not be repaid with oil or gas.

  [Text] Prague, June 9 (CTK) -- Both the Czech and foreign 
options for the privatization of refineries entail high risks, 
although they are not of such decisive strategic importance, 
Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy says in today's 
issue of the daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. When the crude oil 
pipeline from Ingoldstadt, Germany, to Kralupy nad Vltavou has 
been completed, they will quite certainly lose strategic 
importance altogether, he added. 
  He said he rejected "the slightly naive interpretation" that 
selling the refineries to a foreign consortium would be more 
advantageous for the Czech Republic, because it would tie the 
country closer to Western Europe. Dlouhy says he supported the 
"foreign" option because it would in his opinion ensure a speedy 
transformation of the Czech petrochemical industry, so that it 
would be competitive in Europe. He says a foreign consortium 
was offering several advantages, such as solid know-how, capital 
"injections", an active trade policy and long-term ties to a 
crude oil transportation system. 
  Dlouhy says that ministers finally chose the Czech variety 
because the consortium took a long time to present an offer 
which "a responsible government member could submit to the 
government." The idea that if the profits are not re-invested, 
they would most probably go abroad, was yet another disadvantage. 
  When commenting on the Czech option, Dlouhy says that if 
there is systemic market pressure for a speedy increase in the 
productivity and competitiveness of the planned holding company, 
the Czech Republic will draw higher profits in the financial, 
employment, and other areas than those offered by the foreign 
consortium. He says that the ministries of industry and trade 
and of privatization will give preference to projects relying on 
production companies, not trading organizations. 
  The Czech option does not exclude foreign capital input, 
Dlouhy stresses. "However, it is necessary to know in advance 
what will not be possible", he added. It is necessary to 
provide clear guarantees that strategic aspects will be 
respected, he concludes.

  [Text] Prague June 9 (CTK) -- The cancellation of the 
clearing account for trade between the Czech and Slovak 
Republics would be no big problem for the Czech Republic from 
the viewpoint of foreign currency reserves, but may create a 
problem for both sides as regards the volume of trade, Czech 
Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik said today. Kocarnik was 
responding on NOVA Television to yesterday's statement by Slovak 
Economy Minister Peter Magvasi that the clearing account had 
outlived its usefulness. He told CTK that payments ought to be 
liberalised which meant trading in convertible currencies.

  [Text] Budapest, 10 Jun (MTI) -- The proportion of 
parliamentary seats has changed by one mandate to the advantage 
of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) -- at the expense of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). The National Election 
Committee (NEC) checked the 342 invalid votes cast in the 6th 
constituency (Gyor-Sopron County, W Hungary) in the run-off 
elections on May 29, and found 68 to be valid. The revision was 
initiated by MDF candidate Gyorgy Rasko, who finished ten votes 
behind AFD candidate Gyula Varga in the run-off. 
  Of the 68 votes found valid, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor 
Simon of the Hungarian Socialist Party, and 16 to Varga. Thus 
Rasko took over the first place with 9416 valid votes from 
Varga, who had 9406 votes. 
  On Thursday evening, the NEC also examined the approx. 
27,000 
valid ballots in the constituency, and the recounting affirmed 
Rasko's victory. If the Supreme Court does not pass a different 
judgement after revising the case at any possible request, then 
Rasko will represent the 6th constituency in Parliament. 
  SZDSZ delegate to the NEC Ferenc Salamon has told MTI, "The 
SZDSZ candidate is not likely to turn to the Supreme Court for 
supervision. So the National Election Committee will surely 
annouce the official final results of the May 29 second round of 
the elections at its Monday session. Therefore, the MDF is 
almost certain to have 38 seats in the 386-seat National 
Assembly, while the SZDSZ will have 69."

  [Text] Budapest, 9 Jun (MTI) -- "The election victory of 
the Socialist Party does not mean a leftist turn in Hungary, as 
the votes reflect, by and large, equal support for the three 
political trends: the left, the conservatives, and the 
liberals," President Arpad Goncz and Christian Democratic 
People's Party (KDNP) Chairman Laszlo Surjan agreed in talks at 
Budapest's parliament on Thursday. The consultation was part of 
Goncz's recent series of political discussions with 
parliamentary party leaders. 
  Surjan said he had agreed with the president on the key 
importance of a smooth transfer of governmental affairs. They 
both supposed that a coalition government would be formed. 
Regarding the KDNP's future, Surjan said the party should break 
out from the category of a religious party, and emerge in 
political life as a socially-committed party with its own system 
of values and its own message for the whole of society.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Presenting Thursday in the Sejm 
the strategy for Poland, a government-approved document 
outlining major policy lines to be implemented till 1997, Deputy 
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said the 
plan was comprehensive, dynamic and addressed to all Poles. 
  The plan sought to continue positive trends achieved under 
previous cabinets and to solve problems that had piled up and 
went unsolved. The present government had a different 
perception of many issues than its predecessors had had, was 
guided by a different set of values, and wanted to alleviate the 
social costs of transformations under way in Poland, Kolodko 
declared. 
  The cabinet expected to create 350,000 to 400,000 new jobs 
by 
1997, reducing unemployment by an equal number of people. A 
successful implementation of the plan will mean an increase in 
real wages by 11 percent over the coming four years, Kolodko 
added. Average old age pension will grow by 12 to 13 percent 
over that period. 
  The expected growth in the GDP over four years till 1997 is 
22 percent. Consumption will grow by 15 percent, investments by 
a higher figure. Exports are to grow twice as fast, which shows 
that the strategy for Poland assumes export-led growth assisted 
by strong investment component. 
  The plan assumes stability in the economic system to ensure 
that government economic and financial policies are predictable 
and readable to both the business community and ordinary 
citizens. 
  Kolodko appealed to the opposition parties to join in the 
effort of formulating solutions to major national problems, such 
as the reform of the social security system, reduction of the 
public debt, Poland's integration with the European Union, and 
transformation of the Polish agriculture. "These are not 
problems facing the government, or the opposition, they are 
national problems," the minister remarked. 
  The strategy for Poland signals our determination to 
continue 
the process of reforms and charts their future course, Kolodko 
stated. Integration with the European Union is a historic 
process and we want to speed up its pace. We expect our 
partners in the West to honour their commitments and agreements 
signed with Poland.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- President Lech Walesa vetoed a new 
law on the rights and duties of MPs and notified Sejm Speaker 
Jozef Oleksy about his decision on Thursday, the president's 
press office announced on Thursday. 
  The main reason of the decision was that, according to the 
proposed law, a lump money would be paid to deputies and 
senators after the expiry of their terms of office if they were 
running in the next elections, throughout the entire period 
between terms. The president contends that this would actually 
be a privilege jeopardizing those who run for the first time and 
must continue their jobs. 
  The second reason was that the proposed law converted social 
allowances paid to MPs into their regular lump payment and on 
top of that, this article would have been retroactive to June 1, 
1993, if not vetoed.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Head of the National Radio and TV 
Council Ryszard Bender signed on Thursday a licence to broadcast 
nationally for the Warsaw-based Radio "Zet" station. The 
station is the second private radio station, along with the 
"RMF" radio from Krakow, that will air programmes nationwide. 
Bender told a press conference that he hopes that the licence 
for the third non-public radio station, the Catholic "Maryja" 
radio, will be signed next week. 
  Owner of the Radio "Zet" station Andrzej Wojciechowski said 
that his radio would change its programmes and start as a 
completely new station. He also said that on Thursday afternoon 
his radio will start broadcasting a special signal, inaudible to 
human ear, that will act as a repellent to mosquitoes. The 
signal will resemble sounds emitted by bats.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Romanian Defence Minister Gheorghe 
Tinca proposed three groups of issues on which Polish and 
Romanian military should work in further contacts at a meeting 
with his Polish counterpart Piotr Kolodziejczyk on Thursday, the 
office of the spokesman for the National Defence Ministry said 
Thursday. 
  Kolodziejczyk and Tinca, who started his three-day official 
visit to Poland on Thursday, stressed great political importance 
they attached to the meeting. The first group of issues covers 
cooperation as part of Partnership for Peace, with a special 
regard to the presence of observers and sub-units at exercises. 
Minister Tinca proposed participation of the platoon of the 
Polish alpine troops in joint exercises in Romania. 
  The second group would embrace cooperation in armament and 
between arms industries of the two countries. As for this area, 
the Romanian minister proposed to set up a mixed military 
committee to precisely specify Polish-Romanian needs in these 
areas. 
  The third group includes mutual consultations on security, 
developments in Europe, the exchange of training cadres and 
joint seminars on political questions. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk said that all proposals made by the 
Romanian minister corresponded very well to the Polish 
understanding of the policy of security and cooperation. He 
added that Poland would be very open in all these areas. On 
Friday, the Romanian defence minister is to be received by the 
Polish president, the Sejm speaker and the prime minister.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 9 -- Greeting a visiting delegation of 
the Albanian People's Assembly, President Lech Walesa on 
Thursday praised its President Pjeter Arbnori for his 
contribution to the building of democracy. "Politicians engaged 
in the process of building democracy and market economy pay 
great price and cannot expect society to be grateful for this. 
What is important is the aim, not personal successes," the 
president said. The Albanian delegation has been visiting Poland 
at the invitation of the Sejm. 
  During the meeting with Lech Walesa, President of the 
Albanian People's Assembly Pjeter Arbnori thanked for support 
offered to Albania by the Polish delegation in the Council of 
Europe. He recalled that Poland has always had its own opinion 
at the crucial moments of history, and owing to that it became 
an example for Albania and other states on the road to reforms. 
On Wednesday, the Albanian MPs met with the parliamentary floor 
group of the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and representatives 
of Sejm committees.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- Romania's Supreme 
Court, by its civil department, granted [approved] Tuesday, 7 
June, the contestations filed by several parties, associations, 
and revolutionary unions of the country against a re-birth of 
the Romanian Communist Party (RCP.) On 4 May 1994, the 
Bucharest Municipality Tribunal approved the application for 
registration of the RCP headquartered in Targu-Jiu. RCP founder 
Victor Hancu had said then that his party was not a follower of 
the former RCP. 
  After a half-hour deliberation, the Supreme Court ruled the 
decision: "To grant the contestations and the intervention 
requests, to annul the Bucharest Municipality Tribunal's 
decision of 4 May 1994, and to reject the application for 
registration of the Romanian Communist Party." 
  During the trial, the challengers' defendants have invoked 
law 51/1991 regarding Romania's national security, Article 3, 
Paragraph H, which stipulates: "The initiation, organization, 
carrying out, and support in whatever manner of totalitarian and 
extremist actions of communist, fascist, or iron-guardist 
expression is banned." 
  In his defense and in defending the party he initiated, 
Victor Hancu said: "We are not the followers of the RCP and 
most of our members had not been enrolled in the former 
Communist Party. We have no former activists in our structures."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 7/6/1994 -- Tension has been 
generated these last few days in Romanian political life by the 
conflict between Greater Romania Party [PRM] Senator Corneliu 
Vadim Tudor and organizations of December 1989 revolutionaries. 
The series of mutual challenges expressed from the Senate floor 
or from the street, climaxed with a statement made by the 
senator who claimed to possess intelligence according to which 
the parliamentary opposition was preparing together with those 
organizations the assassination of Romania's president and the 
establishment of monarchy. 
  Supporters of the Greater Romania Party and members of the 
revolutionaries' organizations had an encounter near the Senate 
house. Several leading dailies put the number of mobilized 
forces at between 200 and 500 police and gendarmes to keep them 
apart. No incident was however reported. "I think decency and 
reason are needed" told the press Major-General Costica Voicu, 
deputy chief of the General Police Inspectorate. He added that 
"it is not the duty of police to check the information on the 
assassination announced by the PRM leader" and that "this is up 
to specially constituted institutions". 
  A press release from the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] 
issued yesterday afternoon reads: "The analysis of the operative 
situation as well as the data we have in the reference domains 
do not confirm for the near future the existence of real 
intentions (or possibilities) of assassinating Romania's 
president or restoring the monarchy". The release adds that 
"the dissemination of such information, without sufficient 
checking of their probability, causes useless confusion and 
worry or, on the contrary, induce in the public opinion 
disbelief in the seriousness of the allegation".

Christian-Democratic Party] can be considered as a "dynamite 
fuse" inside the CDR. 
  At the end of May Dinu Patriciu assessed that the only 
chance 
for the CDR to be successful in the next elections was to turn 
itself from a coalition having its own right-wing ideology into 
a party, but his proposal was fully rejected by all members of 
the CDR. "It was a reaction easily to foresee, as the CDR was 
the umbrella for many parties that avoided to disclose their 
ideology and state their extraction," said Silviu Brucan. He 
said that the CDR has made its option so far for a quick 
political reckoning by saying that they will receive the 
population's ballots as a result of their discontent with the 
decline of living standard and consequently the CDR could exist 
more as an election forum rather than an option for a government. 
  The statement made a few days ago in Paris by Corneliu 
Coposu, the leader of the PNTCD, namely that in the event his 
party will take the power they will amend the Constitution and 
bring back the monarchy, proves, said Brucan, "lack of political 
thinking and strategy." As long as there are powerful forces 
within the CDR which do not agree to the idea of monarchy, it is 
unlikely, so said Brucan, for them to draw up joint tickets and 
program platforms for the elections. As the majority of the 
voting people are republican supporters, Corneliu Coposu's 
assertion "severely" diminishes the votes to be possibly granted 
to the CDR. 
  The crisis generated within the CDR by the declarations of 
the two politicians has affected "negatively the whole Romanian 
political life, as a strong opposition is badly needed for a 
democratic system to work."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- Romania's Supreme 
Council of Defense has elaborated a document titled An 
Integrated Concept on Romania's National Security, which makes 
an analysis of domestic and external risk factors, as well as of 
the general principles of Romania's defense doctrine. 
  Established on 14 December 1990, under a law adopted by 
Parliament, Romania's Supreme Council of Defense assumed 
responsibility to analyze the state of national security and to 
approve organizational structures and rules on the functioning 
of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. The council gathers 
the country's president, the prime minister, and several members 
of the executive (the defense minister, the minister of the 
interior, the foreign minister, and so on,) the head of the 
president's political analysis department, the director of the 
SRI, the chief of the Foreign Information Department [DIE], and 
the chief of general staff. 
  The document elaborated by the Supreme Council of Defense 
views as domestic risk factors "a negative influence that the 
lack of national political consensus can have on major issues 
confronting Romania," "the lack of will to solve conflicting 
interests between various social groups to the national interest 
and in a democratic manner," as well as the decline in 
production, the devaluation of the national currency, the budget 
deficit, the high rate of inflation, the growing rate of 
unemployment, and so on. 
  "Even if the risk of a foreign armed aggression has 
considerably diminished, threats are still persisting generated 
by pressure and foreign interference directed against Romania's 
sovereignty, independence, integrity, and territorial unity," 
the document reads. 
  The supreme council's document enumerates among the external 
risk factors: The losing of several traditional markets and 
sources of strategic raw materials, the emergence of 
preferential areas of financial and commercial influence, signs 
of revisionism, attempts to approach the issue of the borders, 
higher pressure and actions from abroad having in view the 
granting of collective rights to national minorities, tendencies 
favoring artificial self-rule in several areas on ethnic 
criteria, the uncertain evolution of the situation in the former 
Soviet territories, the expansion of the conflict in the 
territory of former Yugoslavia, and so on. 
  The chapter titled National Security Strategy stipulates 
that 
"Romania has its own military potential for the military defense 
of the country." The defense of national interests is ensured 
"by its own forces," but "political, economic, and military 
support coming from states or international bodies supporting 
its cause would be welcome." The document reads that "the 
Romanian state is viewing no state as potential enemy," pointing 
out that under no circumstances Romania is to be the first to 
start military action and shall not allow use of its force for 
such actions.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- A regional center 
for air traffic control was inaugurated in Arad, western 
Romania, as the first in a set of five such up-to-date centers 
designed to ensure coverage for the entire national territory. 
The inauguration ceremony was attended along with the Romanian 
authorities by representatives of the Eurocontrol, the body 
concerned in air traffic control in Europe which assisted 
Romania in building the center. 
  The Arad center equipment employs the latest technologies. 
The center is endowed with an over-fly radar and other 
automatic equipments enabling the pilot to locate any time the 
position of the center and to know the flight-angle of his 
plane. The center is furnished also with a computer system 
securing a swift information coordination. 
  Beside the Arad center, other four similar centers for air 
traffic control are being built in Bucharest, Cluj, Bacau and 
Constanta. The Arad center has been recently visited by a NATO 
delegation that showed interest in the cooperation relations 
between the civilian and the military flights monitoring. The 
NATO delegation said that the development and upgrading of the 
traffic control of the civilian and military flights would 
speed-up Romania's integration in the European and Euro-Atlantic 
structures.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- "The policy of 
getting closer to NATO, Romania's adherence to the Partnership 
for Peace, to the Western European Union [WEU], the steps we are 
making towards full integration within Euro-Atlantic structures 
are all representing a political option of the Romanian state," 
Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca told the government's daily 
VOCEA ROMANIEI. 
  "Romania is taking part in several UN programs for 
international assistance in areas of conflict," the Romanian 
minister added, reminding that participation of the Romanian 
Army with a field hospital and a subunit to fight radioactive 
contamination during the Gulf war. 
  "Moreover, the Partnership for Peace implies a series of 
concrete offers from us in the field of infantry, artillery, 
navy, and education, that is, those facilities put at the 
disposal for joint action with other NATO partners. For 
Romania, to ensure its security in an unstable area means the 
possibility and compulsory condition to consolidate its market 
economy, to expand commercial exchanges and constructive 
diplomacy apt to ensure the Romanian people a European standard 
of living, without threats of war, without embargoes that are so 
damaging and enjoying full freedom of a democratic political 
life. Democracy must not be only conquered, but also defended," 
the defense minister said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/6/1994 -- Observing that the 
economic and trade exchanges between Romania and the People's 
Republic of China were constantly growing, the Chinese minister 
of machine-building industry He Guangyuan told the Romanian 
Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu at the meeting they had at the Victoria 
Palace Thursday, 9 June, that this evolution should be supported 
by the two governments by diversified forms of trading and by 
expanding the cooperation range. The Chinese minister said his 
country had already adopted a package of measures meant to boost 
China's relations with Romania. 
  Prime Minister Vacaroiu's assessment was that, given the 
conditions offered by the market economy rules governing in both 
countries, the present volume of the bilateral exchanges could 
double.

  [Text] Bratislava June 8 (CTK) -- Slovak ex-Premier 
Vladimir Meciar believes the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), of which he is chairman, will "definitely" win the 
autumn elections. "The question is only by how many percent -- 
whether it will be enough to form a government or whether there 
will have to be a coalition," Meciar said today at a meeting 
with journalists. 
  "We're not closed to anybody... we'll go with anyone who the 
voters choose for us," he said, adding however that he would not 
like to have Hungarian minority leader Miklos Duray as a 
coalition partner. If the other parties were not interested in 
cooperating with the HZDS, it would be their mistake if they did 
not get into the government, Meciar said. 
  "We are not isolated. We have our half of the playground 
which we're playing on, and all the others are in the other 
half," he said. The HZDS had calculations of the results, and 
they would be totally different from what was forecast in the 
polls. 
  He also said that dispute reigned in the coalition, that the 
Hungarian parties were distancing themselves from it because of 
rivalry with the Democratic Left Party (SDL) concerning its 
position in southern Slovakia. Once again, he forecast that the 
SDL, his main political rival, would break up after the 
elections. 
  Meciar presented himself as a defender of the Romany 
minority, and "let on" that negotiations between the HZDS and 
Romany leaders were in their final phase. Many Romanies are now 
declaring themselves to be of Hungarian nationality. "With 
today's spread of power, it could happen that the Hungarians do 
not get into power if the Romanies come forward as one political 
grouping," he said. 
  If the HZDS wins the elections it will be able to come to a 
agreement with Hungary on the conclusion of a basic treaty, 
Meciar said. "I am an optimist as far as finding a solution to 
relations with Hungary in the near future goes," he added. 
Interest in European integration would result in a "major 
settlement" between the two countries, which would put aside 
historical and psychological barriers such as memories of 
Magyarisation, wartime occupation and the presence of Hungarian 
troops in Slovakia in 1968. 
  While his opponents accuse him of worsening relations with 
Hungary, Meciar said today that during secret talks the late 
Hungarian president, Josef Antall, had agreed to Slovakia's 
request that the inviolability of borders be confirmed. "The 
only problem was whether to declare it directly or with 
reference to international documents," Meciar said, adding that 
the same agreement had also been made with ex-Premier Peter 
Boross, but had not been made public due to the Hungarian 
election campaign. 
  On the situation after the socialist election victory in 
Hungary, Meciar said that two groups were forming. One wanted 
relations with Slovakia to improve first, and then a solution to 
the minorities issue, while the other wanted to solve the 
minorities issue first and then improve relations. 
  "The rhetoric of Gyula Horn (chairman of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party) is not so very different from Antall's 
rhetoric. He has changed the terminology, but as regards 
autonomy (for the Hungarian minority) he has not changed 
anything. Some of the things he has said about Slovaks have not 
inspired hope either. Nonetheless, we believe that it was 
pre-election or post-election euphoria, that he will return to 
political realism and that in the interest of improving 
relations we can sign an agreement in a few months. 
  Meciar ascribed his bad reputation in the media to 
"expedient 
propaganda" which until the end of 1992 was supposed to save 
Czechoslovakia and afterwards served new interest groups in the 
world. However, he admitted that the HZDS and former government 
information policy had been "catastrophic" and "sinfully 
neglected." 
  He added that "one neighbouring state last year alone spent 
98 million dollars on creating its reputation," part of which 
had been allegedly spent on forming a negative image for Meciar. 
"And we did not put up even a heller [as recieved] against it. 
That is not the way to build an image," Meciar said.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 9 (CTK) -- "Some political parties 
have set out on a path of stirring up national feelings, 
opposing Slovaks to Czechs and Hungarians, and creating the 
atmosphere of threat," chairman of the Democratic Left Party 
(SDL) Peter Weiss tells the Czech agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE 
NOVINY today. "I believe that this policy glaringly contradicts 
the Slovaks' interests," he adds. 
  "The chairman of the HZDS (Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia) has taken to discrediting, grossly 
slandering, and challenging his political opponents and 
splitting political parties which are not obedient or compete 
with him. In a way, I understand Meciar's attacks against our 
party. The SDL is, in fact, the only political party he has not 
managed to split," Weiss says in reaction to Meciar's recent 
statement that the SDL rank and file should put their leadership 
in order. 
  "As we are the most serious rival to the HZDS in the 
elections (September 30-October 1), Meciar, indulging in his old 
style, has over and over again fabricated rumors about sharp 
feuds in the SDL leadership. I would like to send a message to 
Mr. Meciar that it was not the SDL group of deputies, but that 
of the HZDS which was abandoned by a quarter of its deputies! 
He should perhaps first tidy up his own backyard," Weiss said. 
  "Due to the HZDS and SNS (Slovak National Party) and, 
unfortunately, also a part of ethnic Hungarian Egyutteles 
[Coexistence] movement, the signpost law (stipulating that towns 
and villages with at least 20 percent of ethnic population 
should have bilingual signposts) has become a political problem, 
although at the beginning it was more of a legislative issue. 
Some politicians are evidently engaging in provoking a 
nationalist mood. This is the main reason why the law was not 
passed. The HZDS and SNS on the one hand, and a part of the 
Egyutteles, on the other, simply were not interested in a 
compromise," Weiss states. 
  "If Miklos Duray, chairman of the Egyutteles, chooses 
confrontation, he will only confirm the statement which appeared 
early this year: Meciar cannot be without Duray nor Duray 
without Meciar," Weiss adds. 
  "The SNS Komarno congress has sent a clear message that the 
party of Jan Slota has opted for extreme nationalism. The 
attempt to exclude legally elected deputies of the Slovak 
Parliament of Hungarian nationality from political 
decision-making is against the spirit of the Slovak Constitution 
for which also the SNS deputies had voted, which I would like to 
emphasize," Weiss says. 
  "As the SDL is a left-wing party, it is pushing for the 
principle of social justice, equal opportunities for all, and 
equal distribution of the costs necessary for restructuring the 
economy," Weiss says.

  [Text] Bratislava June 9 (CTK) -- The Christian Democratic 
Movement (KDH), a government coalition party, is proposing that 
a limit of ten million Slovak crowns ($300,000) be set on 
political parties' expenditure during the present election 
campaign. The media -- television, radio, the press as well as 
billboard owners -- should be obliged to inform the Central 
Electoral Commission immediately after the elections of the 
amount each political party spent on advertising, Jan 
Carnogursky said at a press conference today. The Slovak 
general elections are scheduled for September 30 and October 1. 
  If party spending on the campaign exceeded the limit by ten 
percent the state contribution to the party in question would be 
cut by the according amount, he proposed. 
  Carnogursky said the KDH had found support for the motion 
within the government coalition. He did not say when his party 
would formally submit the bill to parliament. The proposal is 
seen as being directed against Vladimir Meciar's party, the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), allegedly the richest 
party after presiding over many privatisation projects while in 
power. Meciar denies the allegations.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 6 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The Slovak National Party (SNS) has returned to the national 
principle. Having "cleansed itself" from the Cernak wing, the 
"nationals" agreed that only a Slovak national could join the 
party, the independent daily SME writes. 
  It writes that the rejection of a joint slate with Vladimir 
Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) at the SNS 
congress on Saturday [4 June] has created conditions for the SNS 
to assume after the autumn early elections a position usual for 
radical parties in stabilized democratic countries. The only 
unpredictable step was the abolition of the post of honorary 
chairman which affected the advocates of the rejected HZDS 
coalition, Jozef Prokes and Marian Andel. 
  Though speculations about the SNS's split did not 
materialize 
at the congress, one surprise should be expected before the 
elections: the participation of "some (former) leading 
representatives" of the SNS on the HZDS slate, the paper says. 
  The pro-Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) daily SLOVENSKY 
DENNIK writes that the SNS will turn into a discussion club at 
the best, comparable with the Christian Social Union or Matica 
Slovenska (cultural and educational organization). 
  The paper points out that it should not be forgotten that 
Meciar had sent a clear message to the SNS, though only three 
days before the congress -- he offered the SNS pre- and 
post-election cooperation. "The nationals have turned down the 
HZDS" and thus "voluntarily stepped on the road to power from 
which there is no divergence.... The road-roller from Zlata 
Idka (Meciar) is already rolling along it and he, as it is well 
known, uses no by-passes, not to say traffic direction 
indicators," the paper concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava June 9 (CTK) -- Slovakia will this year 
receive 40 million ECU [European Currency Unit] (about 1.5 
billion Slovak crowns) within the PHARE [Economic Reconstruction 
Aid for Poland and Hungary] programme for the 1994-96 period. 
The programme was signed here by Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan 
and European Union Commissioner Rene Steichen today. 
  "The European Union has become the most significant foreign 
aid contributor to Slovakia," Kukan said. In 1990-93, Slovakia 
received within PHARE nearly 130 million ECU in support of 
economic reforms. 
  Steichen said that this aid had brought results in most 
sectors but that he was not satisfied in all cases. He added 
that the use of EU aid was regularly checked. The sum of 40 
million ECU is to be distributed among agriculture, the private 
sector, additional training, science and technology, energy, 
environment, transport, public administration reform and 
implementing the EU association agreement.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by Gian Luigi </F>
Paracchini in Ljubljana; date not given] 
  [Text] Ljubljana -- "Relations between Slovenia and Italy? 
I hope that both sides' politics will not spoil the friendship, 
exhibited at the cycling Tour of Italy, between the two peoples. 
We are waiting to understand the Italian Government's real 
thinking; Slovenia's positions and behavior will depend solely 
on this. President Milan Kucan of the Slovene Republic is 
cautious but chilly. 
  [Paracchini] President Kucan, from your tone one would say 
that relations with Italy have considerably worsened. Can you 
explain this to us? 
  [Kucan] I am thinking of Italy's understanding and 
friendship 
during our march toward independence, and in particular during 
the war against Yugoslavia. Understanding and friendship which 
were particularly significant in Friuli Region. 
  [Paracchini] And what has changed nowadays? 
  [Kucan] I am concerned at certain declarations which, even 
if 
made on a personal basis, are far from that climate of 
cooperation. But apart from the concerns, there are worrying 
facts. 
  [Paracchini] For example? 
  [Kucan] I am thinking of the East-West meeting in Warsaw 
where Slovenia was not accepted as a full member, precisely at 
Italy's insistence. And I am thinking of the Paris summit where 
again our country was not mentioned among those with a future 
European potential. And who insisted that this be so. Italy 
yet again. 
  [Paracchini] If Italy officially asked you to review the 
Osimo Treaty, what would you reply? Would Slovenia concede 
anything? 
  [Kucan] The Osimo Treaty settles a whole series of 
questions, 
and as long as the treaty is valid we ought to stick to it. We 
are fully entitled to benefit from it as we are Yugoslavia's 
legal successors. Osimo did not solve the problems in an ideal 
fashion, but if something has to be changed, we need first of 
all to find common bases. And these changes need to safeguard 
our mutual interests in a just fashion. 
  [Paracchini] And borders? 
  [Kucan] Borders should not be a problem in Europe. Rather 
than change them we should eliminate them from our consciousness.

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F>
Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "A 
Refusal Would Have Had Negative Consequences"] 
  [Text] According to our information, immediately after the 
elections, many of the determining personalities of the Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] were firmly opposed to forming a 
coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. However, 
during the intensive debates in the past few weeks, those who 
are against rejecting the coalition offer have gradually gained 
a majority. "The parliamentary consequences of the elections 
cannot be confused with people's desires," [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan 
Peto told MAGYAR HIRLAP. We interviewed Peto on the reasons why 
the Free Democrats had accepted the Socialists' request for 
starting coalition talks. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The SZDSZ convention on 5 June decided in 
favor of starting coalition talks, with a surprising majority 
for many people. According to my information, a major role was 
played in this by the fact that the party's prominent 
representatives and leaders collectively supported this idea. 
  [Peto] The executive committee was generally united. Out of 
the 11 members, only Gabriella Beki and Peter Tolgyessy voted 
against starting the talks. Tolgyessy had not taken part in 
drawing up the proposal that was submitted by the executive 
committee to the national council and on which the convention 
voted. He presented his alternative proposal at the convention. 
Apart from this, the party's leaders were indeed united in the 
view that we have to start talks with the MSZP. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Immediately after the second round of the 
elections, you and Gabor Kuncze said that society had voted 
against the coalition and in favor of a one-party socialist 
government. Why did you change your views within a week? 
  [Peto] On the night of the elections, we indeed said that 
society had voted against the coalition and had not sufficiently 
supported our intentions directed at setting up a balanced 
government. Later, we realized that the parliamentary 
consequences of the elections cannot be confused with people's 
desires. The public opinion poll results published last week 
clearly prove that a significant section of the electors would 
prefer a coalition government to a one-party government. The 
other reason for the gradual change of our views was that we had 
analyzed the consequences of a possible one-party government. 
It became clear that our country's international image would be 
different in the case of a coalition government than in the case 
of a one-party government. Third, the entrepreneurs who regard 
the SZDSZ's program as promising are expecting that we will try 
to implement it, but this can only be done from a governmental 
position. 
  We also had to take it into consideration that, in addition 
to the voters of the MSZP and the SZDSZ, large groups of society 
find it justified to create a balanced coalition government in 
spite of the Socialists' absolute majority. Our decision was 
also influenced by the fact that, unusual in parliamentary 
democracies, the MSZP made a coalition offer to the SZDSZ 
although it had an absolute majority. The rejection of this 
request would have clearly had negative consequences for us. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Between the two rounds of the elections, the 
SZDSZ's leaders emphasized that an absolute majority gained by 
the Socialists would make the conditions for setting up a 
coalition rather difficult. Does this mean that we can expect 
very difficult talks? 
  [Peto] It is perfectly obvious that, from the point of view 
of setting up a coalition, the situation is different when a 
party has absolute, rather than only a relative, majority. In a 
given situation, the MSZP can assert its will in Parliament on 
its own, therefore, it is much more difficult to conduct 
coalition talks under these circumstances. If the MSZP did not 
have an absolute majority then we would have to face different 
kinds of problems at the talks. In this case, the coalition 
would be a condition for forming a government. However, we now 
have a different situation because the Socialists would also be 
able to govern without us.

Minister Jozef Moravcik by unidentified correspondent following

  [Text] [Correspondent] How do you see future cooperation 
with the Hungarian Government, or rather with the future 
Hungarian Government? 
  [Moravcik] Well, I have some very good ideas, just as the 
other side has, too. As we have already declared on previous 
occasions, we should attain something that we call historic 
reconciliation. We, these two nations, at one time lived in one 
state and we had, we have, our own experiences of this 
coexistence, good and less good alike. We should now be able to 
find within ourselves sufficient courage and strength to forget 
everything that we did not consider really good, and be able to 
look to shaping our future relations, because on the basis of 
the orientation of policies, and of foreign policy, this future 
in fact should, I think, be a common future in both countries. 
All this in a wider community, where in fact the intensity of 
mutual relations is far greater than the intensity of the 
relations of two sovereign states. 
  This means coexistence within the European Union. We have to 
concentrate on this, and we have to settle our relations in 
accordance with the interests of both states. [end recording]

new Hungarian law on foreigners violates two paragraphs of the 
European Human Rights Convention. The new law decrees that 
certain foreigners have to undergo an AIDS test; this is 
contrary to stipulations of the international agreement which 
bans discrimination and disallows judging applications for 
asylum on the basis of health. This is what the 
English-language BUDAPEST WEEK writes.

  [Text] The uncertainty surrounding compensation coupons 
has been apparent for a while from the decrease in the coupons' 
market value. At the beginning of the week, the price of the 
instrument approached the 500 forint [Ft] limit, which 
corresponds to approximately 30 percent of the face value 
compounded by interest. However, on Tuesday, the drop in the 
value suddenly stopped, and the average price increased by Ft30. 
According to experts, though, if no adequate privatization 
inventory is offered for the coupons, the stop will only be 
temporary. 
  According to State Secretary Tamas Sepsey, president of the 
National Compensation Office, if there is no adequate offer for 
the coupons, the current market value will remain. So far, 
compensation coupons were issued in the value of Ft110 billion, 
30 billion of which have already been used, and Ft80 billion is 
waiting to be invested on the market. The claims for 
supplemental compensation "forecast" that compensation coupons 
will be issued in the value of another Ft20 billion. What is 
known of future offers is that a Ft750-million portion of the 
Antenna Hungaria company can be subscribed to starting on 16 
May, property in the value of Ft3.9 billion can be acquired in 
the Hungarian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation at the end of May, 
and after 16 June, a Ft500-million package of stock in the EGIS 
Pharmaceutical Factory will be offered in exchange for 
compensation coupons. The palette of exchange offers also 
includes the Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical Products 
Corporation, the Hungarian General Forwarding Enterprise 
[Masped] and the Golden Spider [Aranypok textile retail chain], 
as well as the Hajdu Dairy Products, Hajdu Grain Products, and 
Hajdu Bakeries companies. According to Tamas Sepsey, the land 
auctions can be concluded by the end of May, by the time the 
extended deadline expires, with the exception of 
Szabolcs-Szatmar, Bacs-Kiskun, and Csongrad counties. 
Incidentally, the auctions of state-owned land will only begin 
in September. 
  Coupons can be bought for less than 60 percent of face value 
only if families need the money to buy food, we heard from 
people who tried to buy coupons through classified ads in 
Szombathely. This opinion is backed by the findings of the local 
office of the State Property Agency, according to which people 
carefully consider selling even at face value. According to 
local experts, the drop in the market value is due to seasonal 
fluctuations: In the slow summer season last year it was 
possible to buy compensation coupons for as little as 40 
percent; according to forecasts this year, the market value is 
expected to be below 50 percent. In Miskolc, many ads appeared 
in the newspapers offering 100 percent for compensation coupons. 
In some stores, the coupons are also exchanged at face value 
instead of the daily market value. In spite of the deteriorating 
market value, many people feel that compensation coupons are 
worth keeping, because sooner or later the trend will be 
reversed. 
  In Szabolcs-Szatmar county, the best deal was offered at the 
land auctions. For instance, in Nagyecsed, as much as 
Ft1,200-1,500 was paid in cash for Ft1,000 coupons, while "on 
paper" the original owner, in whose name the bids were made, 
remained. 
  According to Laszlo Bekesi, economic specialist of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, compensation must be completed as 
soon as possible. State property intended for privatization must 
be offered in exchange for the coupons, creating a portfolio 
which would exclude property the sale of which could involve 
capital as well. The acceleration of compensation could propel 
inflation to some extent, but in his opinion, this would still 
cause less damage than dragging out the process. The 
shareholding program for small investors already involves an 
obligation of Ft100 billion for the new government. The 
Socialists do not plan retroactive changes if they get into a 
position to govern, but they would immediately close down the 
program for small investors because they consider this form of 
property distribution, which was started as a campaign tool, 
extremely damaging.

  [Text] Representatives of the current government coalition 
have been scaring recipients of compensation that a different 
coalition government would not implement the compensation laws 
and would not complete the compensation process. It is not 
inconceivable that this, too, contributed to the plunge in the 
prices of compensation vouchers. 
  The opposition parties in parliament--the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ], the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 
and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]--explained repeatedly 
that they would by all means complete the compensation process; 
moreover, they would do so as soon as possible. In reply to 
our question, Attila Karoly Soos [SZDSZ] said that recipients of 
compensation cannot be robbed of their property yet again. Legal 
security also demands that the next government accept, even if 
not too happily, the "bequest" of the previous government. Thus, 
the Free Democrat representative considers it obvious that a 
government coalition which includes the SZDSZ will offer an 
appropriate supply of stocks for compensation vouchers. 
  Should it become part of the government, FIDESZ would also 
like to continue the compensation process and complete its 
implementation as soon as possible. However, the Young Democrats 
do not envision passing a new compensation law either. 
Incidentally, in their opinion, after an assessment of 
obligations against the state's property, a certain amount of 
property should be offered against the compensation vouchers, 
which would include stocks not only of the good companies. Then 
the price of compensation vouchers would be decided by market 
forces. 
  The MSZP also considers Hungary to be a constitutional 
state, 
i.e., the Socialists also undertake to implement laws which were 
passed earlier. Thus, the MSZP did not vow to repeal the laws on 
compensation either. 
  Thus, the current government coalition would perhaps do 
better not to scare recipients of compensation with the prospect 
that if the current government falls, recipients of compensation 
will not have much going for them, either. Rather they should 
perhaps take care to offer more valuable state property for 
compensation vouchers. They could also see to it that one does 
not have to stand in line for days for one or two stocks, or 
they could even enable the recipients of compensation to choose 
from the stocks of 10-12 companies at the same time. 
  This way, the current government coalition might gain more 
votes in the election. Because as things stand now, no one is 
happy, except for speculators; those who received no 
compensation are unhappy because they did not receive any, and 
those who did are unhappy because they did. The price of 
compensation vouchers is decreasing because of the scarce supply 
of stocks and the scare tactics. That is to say, the coalition 
parties cannot take advantage of any of their virtues in the 
middle of the election campaign. To be sure, it is indisputable 
that due to the current government, more than 1 million people 
are recipients of compensation. It is also indisputable that up 
to now, the government made an effort to maintain the price of 
compensation vouchers, which the next government is not likely 
to do wholeheartedly even if it completes the compensation 
process. In other words, instead of scaremongering, they ought 
to act, and then the recipients of compensation would really 
trust in the current coalition, and would prove their trust on 8 
May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mihaly Bihari, political scientist and </F>
parliamentary candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party, by 
Ferenc Gazso; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In the long term, the rotation of two alternative 
economies will be characteristic of Hungary: a new type of 
social democratic course, and a modernized conservative one. 
Liberalism might also remain a considerable factor in shaping 
policies but not in the form of mass parties; rather, through 
its intellectual force. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can 
be regarded as a new type of social democratic party, with 
extremely varied internal subdivisions. This is what we 
discussed with political scientist Mihaly Bihari, who was at one 
time connected to the Social Democrats and is now running in the 
election on the MSZP ticket. 
  [Gazso] Reports are increasing about the chances of victory 
for the Socialists. Is this anticipated election success due to 
the spread of social democratic ideas or to "nostalgia," the 
personal charisma of individual politicians, or some skillful 
tactic in party politics? 
  [Bihari] It can be attributed primarily to the failure of 
the 
Christian-conservative alternative that the demand for the other 
two alternatives--the liberal and the social democratic 
one--increased in Hungarian society. In the 1990 elections the 
country voted for a conservative, modernizing political course. 
However, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] failed for several 
reasons. The content of the modernization it proposed was not 
clear, the coalition sent the country in an economic 
catastrophe, and moreover, it operated the otherwise functioning 
political democracy in the wrong way. All of these factors 
resulted in the temporary failure of the conservative 
alternative. 
  In our region, the new left appears in the form of socialist 
democracy: It is not communism, not reform communism, it does 
not represent a kind of old-fashioned "new left;" it intends to 
operate not merely in the spirit of reform, but not in an 
agrarian-plebeian spirit, either. Due to these features, this 
left can become a factor that can shape history and society in 
the long term. From this point of view, I consider the MSZP an 
accomplished social democratic party. Thus, in the history of 
Hungary these two alternatives--the social democratic and the 
conservative one--will alternate regularly, competing with each 
other, just as is customary in Western Europe. 
  [Gazso] Many people say about the MSZP that it is a 
collective party of several trends and if it comes into power, 
these trends can easily conflict with each other. Is the danger 
realistic? 
  [Bihari] According to the polls, the party might receive as 
much as 30-40 percent of the votes; this means more than 1 
million voters. The political composition of these voters is 
extremely varied. Among them there are obviously people who have 
a nostalgia for the Kadar regime of the seventies, but they are 
not the ones who constitute the mass of supporters. Most of them 
spontaneously share the values of the left, reject too great 
social differences, consider the establishment of a social net 
and the efficient handling of unemployment important, and feel 
solidarity with the groups of society which are left behind and 
are forced to the periphery. 
  Thus, in view of the political constitution of its voters, 
the MSZP is indeed a collective party, just like every other 
modern party. At any rate, the sociological composition of the 
voters gives a more truthful picture of internal subdivisions 
than the interviews given by certain politicians, or the 
position of certain individuals within the organization. It is 
another question altogether that concrete professional disputes 
can arise within the party. In the beginning there was indeed a 
difference between the economic policy draft put together by 
Laszlo Bekesi and the advertisement published last August and 
signed by the party chairman, but this difference of opinion was 
laid to rest in the course of the discussions in the fall, and 
today the party has only one program concerning this issue. 
  [Gazso] How can governing social democratic parties work 
together with trade unions? 
  [Bihari] There are examples of this cooperation going back 
several decades; let us consider, for example, the Scandinavian 
countries, the British Labor Party, the German Social Democrats, 
or the Spanish Socialist Party. These relations are hardly 
without conflict. The cooperation does not mean that the party 
rules the trade union or that the trade union rules the party. 
Both of them are forced to negotiate. Afterwards, the party must 
make other parties accept its position, and in the same way, the 
trade union must fight with other trade unions for the 
recognition of its position, and finally, all of this must be 
coordinated with the employers, as well. The participants of the 
modern "tripartyism," that is to say, the triparty negotiating 
system (government, employers, employees), coordinate their 
positions at a separate forum. Thus, the National Federation of 
Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ] as a factor in the parliamentary 
group and the MSZP as governing party are not the ones to say 
the last word. After all, we are not dealing with a state party. 
  [Gazso] Can the victory of the MSZP, or an eventual 
coalition 
between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], 
have an effect on the party structure? Is it conceivable that 
the tripolar political system will become a bipolar one? 
  [Bihari] Historically there is a chance that a 
left/left-center "party family" (MSZP, SZDSZ) will be formed on 
the one hand, and on the other, a right/right center group of 
parties (for instance, Association of Young Democrats [Fidesz], 
Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP], Smallholder parties). This chance is too slight. 
In Hungary, liberalism has always been a very serious factor in 
forming political aspects, even if it was not expressed in mass 
parties. Thinking back on a 70-80 year history, I dare claim 
that various aspects of liberalism (a trend toward collectivism, 
modernized liberalism, or radical liberalism) do have a future, 
but liberalism has no chance of becoming a mass party. Liberals 
who want to express the concept of liberalism in the form of a 
mass party are sooner or later faced with a dilemma: Should they 
organize themselves like the parties on the left, or like the 
parties on the right? However, liberals who accept that liberal 
parties can have an effect primarily through their social 
sensitivity and high intellectual capability, and not as a 
mass-based party, will feel comfortable in a smaller party or in 
several civilian organizations of intellectuals. For Hungarian 
liberals, this is a realistic role. If they accept it, the three 
political centers will remain.

<F P=106> [Article by Katalin Bossanyi: "Responsibility of Central </F>
Bank Greater in `Interregnum'; Gyorgy Szapary on Currency Rate 
Policy"] 
  [Text] "We have an interest in the earliest possible 
formation of a new government, and in the period of government 
change we will be consulting experts of both the government in 
office and the opposition, just as we did before," Gyorgy 
Szapary, vice president of the Hungarian National Bank [MNB], 
told NEPSZABADSAG. In his opinion, the efforts of both the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP] are directed toward a continuation of market 
reforms. This is a "good message" for the international world of 
finance, as well. 
  "The reestablishment of macroeconomic balance, that is to 
say, stabilization, is central to the economic policy of both 
parties, and this is compatible with the MNB's monetary policy," 
the vice president said, who felt it necessary to emphasize that 
the central bank was a neutral organization, independent of the 
government, but that it had to adjust its monetary policy to the 
economic policy of the government in power. As he put it, the 
MNB was the supreme guardian of monetary policy, but it could 
not perform miracles if the situation of the budget was not 
stabilized. 
  Szapary referred to the international perception that in an 
"interregnum" between election rounds and in the period of 
coalition meetings, central banks have an increased 
responsibility in forming monetary policy. This is especially 
true for the situation in Hungary because in the first third of 
the year, the deficit in the balance of payments greatly 
surpassed projections. As reasons for this, the vice president 
gave the increase in imports and the only inaccurately traceable 
course of the income generated by exports. Therefore, even 
before the first round of elections, the MNB indicated to the 
government that it intended to take measures in its own sphere 
of authority to prevent a further deterioration in the balance. 
It will restrict the liquidity of the domestic money market by, 
for instance, buying back bonds, and increase the prime rate of 
the central bank. This, in turn, will of course influence the 
interest rates offered by commercial banks as well. 
  Szapary told NEPSZABADSAG that the bank was aware of the 
most 
diverse conjectures about a devaluation of the forint. He did 
not want to say anything definite, because that would only 
benefit speculators, but he said that the MNB wanted to continue 
its former exchange rate policy of pursuing a "tactic of small 
steps." Incidentally, the MNB is currently in negotiations on 
issuing bonds abroad.

<F P=106> [Interview with Expo '96 Commissioner Etelka Pataky Barsi by </F>
Gyorgy Dioszegi; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Two years before the opening of Expo '96, the 
public learns more and more frequently about various events 
connected with the preparations. Because of the increasing 
frequency of Expo events, we requested an interview with 
Honorary State Secretary Etelka Pataky Barsi, Expo 
commissioner. 
  [Dioszegi] How far are the preparations advanced at the site 
of the expo? 
  [Barsi] The construction of the underground infrastructure 
is 
nearing completion. One of the big buildings which will remain 
after the Expo is already under construction. The evaluation 
committee of experts made a decision a few days ago about 
awarding a contract to build the Hungarian pavilion, work on 
which will begin in July. The planning of the Austrian pavilion 
will also be finished soon; it will be planned and built by the 
Austrians, but after the Expo closes, that building will also 
become part of the university campus. The construction of the 
Lagymanyos bridge is going ahead at full speed. Within a few 
weeks preparations will begin for the construction of the 
footbridge as well. The plans for the sports and cultural center 
are also completed; it will house, among other things, a 
large-scale sports facility and a theater which can accommodate 
an audience of several hundred. These are only the larger 
projects; I will not even mention the smaller ones. Furthermore, 
the coordination of cultural programs is under way, because 
every day of the Expo will have one or more important cultural 
events. Every country will have a national day when it will be 
able to present the values of its own culture. 
  [Dioszegi] While traveling in the countryside, one hears 
more 
and more often that people are preparing for the Expo. 
  [Barsi] We invited bids for events before, after, and during 
the Expo, and more than 1,000 ideas and suggestions were 
submitted. The suggestions include an international meeting of 
cavalrymen, a scientific conference on great lakes, a festival 
of the Hungarian chess players worldwide, a jewelry world fair, 
a world fair of inventions, and a folklore show by seven small 
villages. 
  [Dioszegi] How do foreigners react to our efforts? 
  [Barsi] We held the first international meeting on our world 
fair in March. We found with considerable pride that in the 
entire history of world fairs this was the first time that two 
years before the opening of the exhibition, at the meeting of 
the organizing country, representatives of the foreign countries 
could receive an answer to every question, and they would be 
able to see how much progress was made. As a result of our 
preparatory work, 59 countries replied to our invitation. Only 
seven of them gave a negative answer. Positive replies came from 
29 countries. Austria, Holland, Germany, and the Vatican have 
already appointed their commissioners. Some countries, such as 
Switzerland or Finland, have already reserved their exhibition 
areas. Approximately 23 countries consider it important to 
introduce themselves; they are looking at their possibilities 
and are working on their budgets. 
  [Dioszegi] The question is unavoidable: Will the Expo be 
profitable? Will it be worth it? 
  [Barsi] The budget of the Expo at 1993 prices is $1 billion. 
Of this amount, 31 percent will come from budgetary support as 
defined by law, 24 percent from direct income, 26 percent from 
state bonds, and another 19 percent from the lottery, 
privatization income, and the sale of real estate. Furthermore, 
I can assert that we are not building a "disposable" Expo. The 
use of everything is predetermined. By this I mean that the 
universities would have needed the buildings two decades ago 
already. The footbridge will be transferred to a Hungarian town. 
The portion of the M0 highway loop which is under construction 
now will relieve the crowded capital this year already, and the 
updated railroad between Budapest and Vienna will also continue 
to operate. These are only a few random examples. But if I add 
to this that at least 10 million visitors will come to the Expo 
and that they will stay here, use transportation, and eat, then 
taxes on the additional income from services and catering 
establishments can also be regarded--indirectly--as income from 
the Expo. In this way, it can hardly be a question whether it 
will be worth it.

<F P=106> [Article by Eszter Szaloky] </F>
  [Text] On Wednesday Ferenc Madl, minister of culture and 
public education, is scheduled to sign an agreement on the 
long-term financing of religious schools by the state with 
institutions which were so far unable to come to an agreement 
with local governments. 
  In reply to NEPSZAVA's question, the minister stated that 
this measure concerned more than 100 schools. As is well known, 
based on the terms of this contract the government would 
undertake to finance religious schools for 20 years, in spite of 
the fact that local governments as well as the parties protested 
the planned transaction. The deal has been called a 
renationalization of the schools, which is contrary to the 
spirit of the law on public education, namely, to the intention 
of decentralizing public education. As Gabor Horn, education 
specialist of the Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], put it, 
if these contracts go into effect, religious institutions will 
give up their schools themselves. After all, this contract will 
turn religious schools into public schools. 
  Assessing the past four years of the portfolio, the minister 
called the new, 1993 law on public education an outstanding 
accomplishment. At the press briefing presenting his evaluation 
he added: The national basic curriculum was completed after much 
superfluous discussion which did not contribute to the 
portfolio's reputation. As the greatest accomplishment 
concerning higher education, the minister emphasized the 
autonomy of institutions. 
  According to information available to us, the program for 
the 
Renewal of the Profession of Educators [PSZM] did not receive a 
penny of the 82 million forints which were allocated to it from 
the budget. This money is intended for the establishment and 
development of county regional educational centers. Concerning 
these, Ferenc Madl told NEPSZAVA that the restoration of the 
PSZM program is under way, but this does not mean that it will 
be abolished. The board of trustees which used to be headed by 
Jozsef Zsolnai was dissolved only in form. The minister said he 
considered it conceivable that by the time the contractual 
obligations of PSZM are fulfilled, a different crew, of similar 
composition than the previous one, can take over this program.

<F P=106> [Article by Gabor Oblath] </F>
  [Text] There was not a single country in our entire region 
where total exports, as well as exports to the West, declined to 
the degree they did in Hungary. Notably, Hungary had the largest 
deficit in the balance of payments and the largest relative 
trade deficit (compared to exports and to the GDP). The fact 
that exports increased slightly in the first quarter of this 
year cannot be interpreted as a sign of reversal in view of the 
extremely low level of trade in the same period of last year. 
Imports grew much faster than exports, and the enduring and very 
considerable deficits in the balance of trade and the balance of 
payments ($750 million and $800 million, respectively, in three 
months) begin to threaten the stability of the economy. 
  The trouble is greater than one would think; to realize 
this, 
one should discard two beliefs in particular. According to one 
belief, the 1993 decline in our exports was part of a general 
East European trend which was caused primarily by the recession 
in the West. According to the other, the huge deficit in the 
balance of trade and the balance of payments in the first 
quarter of this year is actually "a good thing" because it is a 
sign that the economy began to grow. 
  Both parts of the first belief mentioned above are based on 
an error. On the one hand: In 1993, in a number of East 
European countries, the value of exports expressed in U.S. 
dollars did not decrease but increased (especially that of the 
exports into industrialized countries), and the fact that the 
total exports of the region decreased slightly was largely due 
to the extreme decline in Hungarian exports. Concerning the 
entire region, we have final data only for the first three 
quarters of last year. These data indicate that the total 
exports from Eastern Europe as well as the exports to the 
industrialized countries expressed in U.S. dollars decreased by 
approximately 2 percent compared to the same period of the 
previous year. However, if we disregard Hungary's results and 
look at the exports of only the other countries, it appears that 
last year the rest of the countries increased their total 
exports by 3 percent, and their exports to the West by 4.5 
percent.[.sup]1[/] 
  On the other hand, in spite of the recession in the West, 
the 
Czech Republic was able to increase the dollar value of its 
exports to the West by 20 percent, Poland by 12 percent, and 
Romania by 7.5 percent. (Since the export prices of the 
aforementioned countries calculated in U.S. dollars decreased, 
the increase in the volume of their exports was even more 
considerable.) In view of these results it is difficult to 
believe that Hungarian exports to the West decreased in 1993 by 
21 (!) percent largely because of the recession in the West. And 
indeed, this explanation is without any factual foundation. 
Namely, while the Western demand for import goods from the 
entire East European region decreased by 5 percent, the 
so-called specific demand for imported goods which is relevant 
for the individual countries[.sup]2[/] decreased more than 
the average (by 5.5 percent) in the case of the Czech Republic 
and Poland, which both exhibited considerable export growth. 
Thus, the recession in the West does not explain anything. The 
reason for the difference in export results must be found within 
the individual countries, in the internal prerequisites and the 
differences in economic policies. 
  The other belief is that the Hungarian trade deficit is 
actually a good thing because it is connected to the 
vitalization of the economy. This opinion is unfounded, but this 
is not the only problem with it. Namely, those who believe or 
want people to believe that things are basically all right 
unwittingly obscure two connected but fundamentally different 
issues. One of them is whether there are favorable economic 
processes behind the trade deficit, i.e., whether the deficit is 
desirable. The other question is whether the imbalance can be 
sustained. 
  Strongly simplified, one can say that the trade deficit is 
desirable if it happens while exports are increasing and is 
prompted by processes which can provide a foundation for the 
subsequent growth of the economy. However, it is certain that 
the deficit is undesirable when it is accompanied by a decrease 
in exports, a considerable increase in imports not for the 
purposes of investment projects, and by domestic producers being 
squeezed out of the domestic market. These symptoms indicate the 
low or decreasing ability of the country to compete on the 
international market; they are hardly desirable. 
  However, the trade imbalance is characterized not only by 
the 
favorable or unfavorable processes which created it, but also by 
its relative size. Although there are no rigid limits, generally 
it is still possible to decide whether the relation of the 
deficit to the country's foreign currency income, GDP, foreign 
currency reserves (or other indicators) is still in a realm in 
which the deficit can be financed on a sustained basis (without 
undermining the country's future financial standing), then the 
deficit can still be sustained. However, there is a limit beyond 
which the deficit becomes unsustainable. Of course, this limit 
is not independent of the perception of creditors and foreign 
investors whether the deficit is desirable, and by far precedes 
the point after which the deficit becomes technically impossible 
to finance. (Incidentally, one should not rely on the momentary 
judgments of creditors and investors, because they can 
unexpectedly and fundamentally change.) Approaching this limit, 
the country itself must take convincing steps to reduce the 
deficit. If these steps are not taken by the country, sooner or 
later they will be taken by creditors and investors. 
  Looking over the East European countries' 1993 results, one 
can find examples of desirable and sustainable trade deficit. 
For instance, in the Czech Republic, exports increased very 
rapidly, and investment-oriented imports increased considerably, 
while the deficit remained negligible. Slovenia offers an 
example where the deficit is presumably undesirable (it was 
induced by a slight decrease in exports and an increase in 
consumption), but because it is insignificant, it is also 
sustainable. Finally, there is also an example where the deficit 
is the result of desirable processes (primarily due to economic 
expansion; it was accompanied by a rapid growth in exports to 
the West and the import of machinery), but it is presumably 
still not sustainable, because it is too large; this is the 
situation in Poland. 
  The trade deficit in Hungary is fundamentally different: The 
deficit is primarily due to a decrease in exports, and the 
increase in imports in 1993 had little to do with an 
acceleration of the economy; at any rate, indications of the 
latter are uncertain. But independent of all this one must see 
that if the deficit reached one-third of the value of the 
exports, and is beginning to exceed 10 percent of the GDP, it is 
certainly not sustainable. Not even when, due to credits, the 
level of foreign currency reserves increased to a relatively 
high level. Namely, these reserves are meager compared to the 
deficit, and they imply mostly debts. 
  A comparison of the results of Hungarian foreign trade with 
other countries of the region indicates that the decrease in 
Hungarian exports was unique and by far not unavoidable. The 
roots of the problem must be found not without, but within, in 
Hungarian economic prerequisites and economic policy.

individual countries can be calculated as the weighted average

  [Text] Bavaria is providing 1.8 million marks worth of new 
subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses. RKW (Board for 
the Economy's Rationalization), headquartered in Frankfurt, has 
opened an office in Hungary. Its purpose will be to subsidize 
consulting for businesses that are about to be formed, are in 
the process of being formed, or have been newly formed. 
  In Bavaria, the purpose of RKW is to assist new, 
medium-sized 
businesses. There this activity is based on traditions of 40 
years standing. As the managing director of RKW said at his news 
conference yesterday, 90 percent of the businessmen in Bavaria 
are satisfied with this service. However, German assistance can 
be effective only if it is based on local experience. Therefore 
RKW has concluded a cooperation agreement with IPOSZ (National 
Federation of Trade Associations), an umbrella organization 
whose associations have a combined total of 709,000 businessmen 
members. When signing the agreement for the Hungarian side, 
IPOSZ Chairman Gyorgy Szucs noted that the agreement was another 
successful step toward the realization of the four-year-old 
program that had set as its objective the development of a 
system of consultancy services to ease the first steps of small 
businesses, thereby making the about-to-be-formed or newly 
formed businesses competitive and thus contributing to their 
long-term survival. 
  German financing for the program will be arranged through 
the 
Ausgleichsbank. RKW is maintaining its Hungarian office in the 
IPOSZ building on Imre Kalman Street. We learned from office 
manager Andrea Glodi that a staff of 40 to 80 consultants will 
be in place by the end of May or early June. The consultants are 
being selected on the basis of personal interviews conducted by 
RKW experts. RKW will provide further training for the 
successful candidates. The first businesspeople will be able to 
call at the office foreseeably by the middle of June. The 
subsidies will be administered directly through the banks 
participating in the Start loan program. Persons considering a 
business career may seek consulting before the final decision to 
start a business; persons establishing a business, before and 
during its establishment; and the owners of start-up businesses, 
during the first three years of operation. They may seek advice 
about their business plans, their foreseeable market and 
competitive situation; about the availability of financing and 
the selection of location; as well as about questions arising in 
conjunction with the elaboration of their business strategy, 
operational plans, or marketing plans. A business may avail 
itself of at most six subsidized personnel-days of consulting 
time, with RKW footing half the consulting fee. 
  RKW will maintain its office in Hungary foreseeably for 18 
months. The signatories of the cooperation agreement are 
confident that the consulting system will be able to stand on 
its own feet by that time, and to function without foreign 
subsidies. 
  This hope is being nourished also by the agreement that 
IPOSZ 
signed today with Ernst &amp; Young. The gist of the agreement is 
that henceforth this well-established accounting and consulting 
firm will accept also small businesses as its clients. As Arpad 
Tertak, the firm's general manager, put it, the firm will place 
at the disposal of business representatives and members of the 
trade associations belonging to IPOSZ the business experience 
and knowledge it has accumulated over several decades. Through 
IPOSZ, the firm will assist clients with consultancy services, 
including the preparation of loan applications. It will also 
undertake to find foreign sources of financing and professional 
and institutional investors as potential partners.

  [Text] Last night, locator vehicles of the Communication 
Authority identified the illegal broadcasting station of Radio 
Tilos [Forbidden] in a Budapest apartment on Sziv Street. The 
police took action, whereupon the representative of the 
Communication Authority initiated action against an unknown 
offender for the violation of the press ordinance. 
  As one might recall, Radio Tilos also submitted a bid to 
launch a local radio station, but the Ministry of Culture and 
Public Education rejected their bid, together with those of two 
other community stations. Radio Tilos announced at that time 
that it would resume its illegal broadcasts. 
  Dr. Eva Balla, leading attorney of the Communication 
Authority, told NEPSZABADSAG that according to a law, 
broadcasting without a studio permit requires the involvement of 
the police and the initiation of proceedings. She said that in 
the course of yesterday's action it did not come to atrocities, 
but she regretted that the operators of Radio Tilos refused all 
cooperation. Thus, criminal proceedings must be started ex 
officio, and as a result, on the basis of the current law, Radio 
Tilos will not be able to receive a broadcasting permit for 
three years. Incidentally, the attorney does not understand why 
the community station was not granted a permit, because it would 
have been an colorful addition on the air. 
  (We were unsuccessful in our attempts to interview the 
illegal radio operators about the events.) 
  We reported in our Monday issue that the Fiksz [Fix] Club

the Ministry of Culture and Public Education [MKM] refused them

<F P=106> [Editorial by Mihai Mihailescu: "Out of Too Much Honesty"] </F>
  [Text] It has become clear by now to every Romanian 
citizen what the four-year rule of the Iliescu group means. 
However, the main characteristic of the Romanian people's 
attitude is great anemia rather than revolt or the wish to bring 
about change. As a matter of fact, the Iliescu group has worked 
in such a way as to bring us to a state of despair that makes us 
see nothing before our eyes but the fierce struggle for 
survival. Very few people think about an alternative. 
  Thus, the opposition has to offer us one. First of all, the 
opposition must convince us that this poor nation is really in 
need of an alternative. However, it seems that the opposition 
has not been very convincing. 
  Without minimizing the force of the Democratic Party 
(National Salvation Front), one should still stress that the 
central pillar of the opposition is the Democratic Convention of 
Romania [CDR]. Its moves lead or decide on matters of the 
strategy of the opposition in the political game. The latest 
developments of the CDR should be examined from this angle. 
  Nobody contests the fact that the most incisive member of 
the 
CDR is the Liberal Party-1993 [PL-93]. Many have even accused 
this party of being extravagant. If one examines the issue 
correctly and carefully, it becomes clear that the extravagance 
of the PL-93 is in reality well calculated. The debate on and 
endorsement of the law on the 1994 budget seemed to face a 
serious struggle. A heated atmosphere prevailed at the opening 
session of the joint meeting of the two chambers of Parliament. 
The PL-93 called for legal action against Prime Minister 
Vacaroiu and Finance Minister Florin Georgescu. In spite of the 
fact that the request of the PL-93 was very surprising, the 
arguments showed common sense and were indeed well- founded. 
  Again, the fire lasted only for one day. The majority of 
parliament representatives succeeded in eliminating from the 
agenda the discussions on the issues proposed by the PL-93. 
However, the CDR members, in their addresses, permanently 
incriminated the prime minister and finance minister. But 
again, nothing happened. Even the members of the PL-93 
abandoned the attempt. The fact that not much was achieved does 
not matter. However, it would have been an intelligent move 
against the Iliescu group. Through the echo of such a move, 
people would have realized that they are ruled by an incompetent 
government. Many people asked why the liberals gave up so 
easily. We do not believe that the reason was the CDR's 
inconsistency, its weakness, or its lack of dexterity in the 
political game. But the CDR did not wish to be accused of 
blocking in any way the proceedings of Parliament. In any 
event, although the result would have been the same, the CDR 
would have gained a lot in the political struggle. 
  Coposu's declaration to the effect that the PNTCD will fight 
for a change of the Constitution and the reestablishment of 
monarchy came as an explosion. It has been proved and we 
believe it, that, at least for a long period of time, the 
constitutional monarchy is the best solution for Romania. 
However, unfortunately the majority of the population has not 
understood this. We are convinced that Mr. Coposu made this 
statement out of the wish to honestly communicate the intention 
of the PNTCD if it comes to power. There is no question about 
the fact that Mr. Coposu is the symbol of a righteous person. 
We are not convinced, however, that this was the right moment 
for such a declaration. 
  How many of those who changed their option and started 
moving 
toward the CDR were bothered by this declaration? Many people 
were expecting a dispute to break out between the parties 
included in the CDR after the PNTCD leader declared its 
intentions. However, he explained that he had made the 
statement on behalf of the party. We admire Mr. Coposu's 
frankness, but repercussions for the CDR might still emerge in 
the Romanian political system. 
  Out of too much honesty, one can lose the political ability. 
Let us not forget that while the Iliescu group promised 
changes, it is frantically working for restoration. It was a 
fat lie, but still, the Iliescu group is doing fine. Even with 
Mr. Vacaroiu....

<F P=106> [First part of Ion Cristoiu editorial: "What Has Got Into </F>
Mr. Corneliu Coposu"] 
  [Text] At the recent news conference of the PNTCD 
[National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], Corneliu Coposu 
said that if his party comes to power, it will modify the 
Constitution to be able to bring King Mihai back to the helm of 
the country. According to Coposu, the reestablishment of the 
monarchy is the only way to save the country from the deep 
crisis it is currently facing. The leader of the peasant party 
made no secret of his faith in King Mihai. He has affirmed on 
several occasions that he sees the king as the only person able 
to change the situation in Romania. However, never before has 
this belief been expressed so strongly and clearly, and mainly, 
it has never been accompanied by explanations about the way in 
which the king will be brought back to the throne. Politicians 
often use their analytical knowledge on various issues. The 
salvation of the country is one of the themes on which they can 
fully show their willingness to express an opinion. In the case 
of Coposu, we are by no means dealing with an idea that sprang 
from the need of the PNTCD leader to be original. No doubt, 
here we are witnessing the proclamation of an electoral program. 
This is also proved by the fact that after he had revealed it 
also at the Paris symposium devoted to exile issues, Coposu 
returned to his ideas regarding the monarchy with the same 
intensity during the news conference held at home. 
  The attitude of the opposition parties toward King Mihai so 
far has been marked by visible ambiguity. Even Coposu's PNTCD 
avoided publicly broaching the issue of King Mihai's return to 
Romania as monarch. The explanation for this prudence can be 
found in an electoral calculation. All opinion polls so far 
have shown the vast majority of the population to be 
incontestably republicans. The monarchist part of the 
population, even if not too large, showed an electoral 
determination that cannot be contradicted by a party without 
risk of losing votes. To please both the republican and the 
monarchist sides, the opposition parties left the issue of the 
position toward King Mihai in suspension. They did not clearly 
declare themselves monarchist for fear of losing the votes of 
the republican majority. However, they did not declare the act 
of bringing the king to Romania as impossible, in order to make 
the monarchists believe that, nonetheless, they support his 
majesty. 
  Within this context, Coposu's clear statements struck our 
entire political scene with amazement. They surprised both the 
right as well as the left. The right was reduced to barely 
understandable stammering. ROMANIA LIBERA, the newspaper that 
expresses the state of mind of the Romanian right wing but also 
of the monarchist part of the population, yesterday [2 June] 
published a slightly distraught commentary. With all necessary 
precautions, Coposu's position is considered ultimately as being 
maybe even dangerous for the political capital of the CDR 
[Democratic Convention of Romania]. On the left of our 
political spectrum, the stupefaction regarding such a 
unambiguous position of the PNTCD leader was equally immense. 
  On the parties in the government coalition, King Mihai has 
the effect of a hot iron rod thrust directly in the ribs. It is 
enough for them to hear his name and they start frantic 
gesticulations. This time, the leaders of the respective parties 
were simply paralyzed. The only reaction from the left was from 
Adrian Nastase [leader of the Social Democracy Party of Romania 
-- PDSR]. His position makes the echo provoked by Coposu among 
the members of the left-wing even more enigmatic. Nastase was 
content to consider the declaration as "extremely grave and 
serious." The laconic nature of this viewpoint can be explained 
certainly through the elements that are strictly connected with 
Nastase's personality: a certain elegance in the political 
dispute and concern about not being too tough with Corneliu 
Coposu, the only right-wing leader who publicly expressed his 
sympathy with the PDSR leader. However, at the same time it is 
clear that Nastase's laconicism also expresses the preoccupation 
not to start making statements on an issue on which the PDSR has 
not yet expresses its position. 
  Thus, the reactions to Corneliu Coposu's statement betray a 
profound state of bewilderment. Something along the line: What 
has got into Mr. Coposu? Our answer to this question can be 
found in the next issue of our newspaper.

<F P=106> [Second part of Ion Cristoiu editorial: "What Has Got Into </F>
Mr. Corneliu Coposu?"] 
  [Text] As I was writing in the previous issue of our 
newspaper, the statements made by Corneliu Coposu [leader of the 
National Peasant Christian Democratic Party -- PNTCD] to the 
effect that if the PNTCD comes to power it will modify the 
Constitution and will reinstate the monarchy, caused great 
bewilderment among politicians, a state that could be best 
defined through the question: What has got into Mr. Corneliu 
Coposu? Searching for an answer, the left-wing of our political 
spectrum thought that this is perhaps a blow whose hidden 
meanings are not yet known. Therefore, this side preferred to 
adopt a position of prudent silence. However, Corneliu Coposu's 
political friends interpreted this declaration as a gaffe. This 
is also what the ROMANIA LIBERA editorial devoted to this issue 
says, not without some sort of gentleness. Condemned as being 
untimely, with serious consequences for the CDR [Democratic 
Convention of Romania] the declaration is explained by the fact 
that the PNTCD leader, an honest man, insisted on telling the 
Romanian people "what the PNTCD has in mind if it comes to 
power." Under the nicer aspect of this statement there is also 
a deadly hidden thorn. The concealed reasoning is the 
following. Coposu knew what disaster his declaration on 
reinstating of monarchy would cause to the PNTCD and the 
opposition in general. Nevertheless, without anybody forcing 
him, he started, out of the blue, to state what the PNTCD will 
do in the event it comes to power. And all this only because 
he, unlike others, is an honest man. Why is this reasoning a 
thorn in the nice aspect of the statement? Because it shows us 
Coposu as a great personality when it comes to the moral aspect 
of the issue, but infantile when we consider the political 
aspect. Luckily, Coposu is far from the way the reasoning of 
his friends wants to present him to us. Without any concessions 
to the moral aspect of the issue, one has to admit that Coposu 
is an experienced politician who is carefully weighing his moves 
and statements. From this point of view, his statement 
regarding the reinstatement of the monarchy in Romania is not a 
gaffe, as some would have it, but the result of a rational 
calculation. Through this statement, the PNTCD leader solves 
several things. 
  First of all, he brings back the radical and inflexible 
anti-government and anti-presidential position of the PNTCD that 
the negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of 
Romania] have seriously damaged. Nothing can separate the PNTCD 
from the PDSR and from President Iliescu more than such a 
categorical declaration regarding the restoration of the 
monarchy. This is a point on which the ruling party and 
President Ion Iliescu will never reach a compromise with any 
party. Thus, Coposu's declaration is meant to reaffirm in a 
spectacular way in the eyes of the electorate the fact that 
between the PNTCD and those in power there is a huge gap. One 
of the diversionary maneuvers used against the opposition was to 
systematically release rumors about secret negotiations that the 
PDSR and the presidency are holding with the PNTCD. Affirming 
that the program of his party is based on the restoration of the 
monarchy, Coposu makes it impossible for those in power to 
resort to such maneuvers in the future. Likewise, this makes 
impossible any attempt of the PDSR and of the presidency to 
resume the masquerade of negotiations with the opposition. 
Thus, strongly separated now from those in power, the PNTCD 
insists on emphasizing more clearly than ever that the entire 
responsibility for the disaster rests exclusively with those 
currently in power. 
  Second, through his definite declaration, Coposu is 
preparing 
his party for the future elections. It is clear that the next 
elections will be dominated by the idea of the need to change 
the current state of affairs. Certainly, the parties will 
propose to the electorate a radical solution that the Romanian 
people has not met so far. No doubt, political parties will 
propose all kinds of solutions to the electorate. The party 
that is going to propose a radical solution that the Romanian 
people has not met so far will have a chance to win. No doubt 
this proposal will not be the reform, privatization, or return 
to communism. Such solutions have already been expressed, with 
the already known disastrous results. Therefore, the solution 
that one could bet on, even if it involves certain risks, would 
be the establishment of the monarchy. Apart from the fact that 
it has not been applied so far, this solution has a few 
important advantages: it is radical, since it presupposes a 
total change of the current situation; it is simple to explain, 
because it does not refer to very complicated economic 
arguments, which are difficult to understand, but resorts to 
political and sentimental arguments; and it is based on the 
nostalgia of the Romanian people for the providential person 
(the kings will come and solve everything!). It is possible 
that the PNTCD leader is mistaken in his calculations. He might 
be taking an enormous risk with this electoral program. 
However, any risk is preferable to the disaster that the 
opposition is currently facing.

<F P=106> [Article by Oana Iurascu: "Ioan Gavra: `Ioan Aurel Stoica's </F>
Burial Ceremony -- A Festive, Ideological Manifestation'"] 
  [Text] Ioan Gavra has denied the existence of a rift 
between him and the chairman of the PUNR [Romanian National 
Unity Party], explaining that differences of opinion are normal 
in a party with a democratic life, as long as the expression of 
these differences does not affect the public image of the PUNR. 
"There is no problem with unity in the PUNR," he emphasized, 
while predicting an earthquake in the PD(FSN) [Democratic 
Party(National Salvation Front)]. 
  The PUNR deputy chairman characterized the burial ceremony 
for PD(FSN) Senator Ion Aurel Stoica in Cluj as a "festive, 
ideological manifestation," considering as unjustified the 
massive presence of PD(FSN) representatives from the county 
organizations. Gavra said that since the former PD(FSN) senator 
did not "die a hero's death," the request that he be buried in 
the Cemetery of Heroes in the locality was unjustified: "Former 
members of the nomenklatura do not deserve to be there." In any 
event, Stoica is still, after his death, the object of attention 
of the commission for monitoring housing space for parliamentary 
representatives because, according to Gavra, he had two villas, 
in Cluj and in Bucharest. Gavra reported that he informed the 
Public Prosecutor's Office of the cases of Basescu and Sasu, who 
slandered him, and that he asked for lOO million lei in 
compensation for moral damages, saying that this was "just 
pennies" for the two members of the PD(FSN).

<F P=106> [Article by Iulia Rosca: "A Question a Day Column; `What </F>
Does European Extension Mean?'"; response by Adrian Severin, 
Democratic Party deputy and representative of the Parliamentary 
Assembly to the Juridical Commission for Human Rights] 
  [Text] "At this time, the main concern of the Council of 
Europe is its own redefinition. At the time of its 
establishment, two zones existed in Europe: one was free and 
democratic and the other was occupied and supervised militarily, 
spiritually, and civilly. This configuration no longer exists. 
The USSR has disappeared and, in its place, the CIS has 
appeared. It is not known exactly what type of community it is 
or whether its members really are independent states. The 
Council of Europe will have to redefine the concept of Europe. 
  In this situation Europe no longer appears only as a 
geographic area but as an area of behavior, a cultural and 
historical area and even an area of specific interests. For 
example, the Encyclopedia Britannica -- a scientific document 
used in the Council of Europe -- defines Europe as a peninsula 
of Asia, between the Atlantic and the Urals. Such a definition 
cannot be accepted. What will the integration of Russia in 
Europe mean? The acceptance of the extension of the borders of 
Europe beyond Azerbaijan? 
  First of all, emphasis is placed on the idea of a European 
space, which is extended in regard to culture and behavior and 
on the idea of specific interests. In this system of reference, 
there are movements of geographic boundaries. The failure to 
clarify specific interests generates a state of constant 
insecurity. For this reason, the Council of Europe cannot 
restrict itself to the issue of human rights but also must deal 
with security problems. Whenever European standards on human 
rights are in question, European security is implicitly in 
doubt. The extension of Europe also modifies economic standards 
of property rights and access to the market economy. 
  Romania, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia have common borders 
with the former USSR. Hungary and Romania do not have a common 
border with Russia so they are not part of the so-called `first 
line' in the sphere of interest of the Russian Federation. The 
current CIS should not be identified with the former USSR, the 
inveterate adversary of democracy and pacifism. The 
aforementioned countries should give more attention to their 
mutual relations. However, it would be dangerous for us to 
believe that, with the disappearance of the USSR as a political 
concept, the expansionist and autocratic spirit which has 
characterized the history of Russia for so many centuries has 
also disappeared. 
  We must recognize that today's Russia is a superpower, even 
though it has very great problems. We know that when a 
superpower is `sick' it is more dangerous than when it does not 
have any weaknesses. This is why the internal stability of 
Russia and of the countries in its sphere of influence should be 
a major concern of Europe. Unfortunately, this stability is not 
easy to achieve and should not be confused with moments of 
domestic tranquillity or with pacificist statements made to the 
outside world. Stability must be based on a democratic structure 
and a sound economy, which would truly guarantee the domestic 
and foreign security of states. The instability of a state 
presents a danger for its neighbors. 
  Perhaps we should add Turkey to the list of the four 
countries which I mentioned earlier. Turkey is a neighbor of the 
former USSR in the Asian zone. In my opinion, the European West 
should support these states not for the purpose of creating a 
defensive military barrier but to form a starting zone for 
actions in the aid of Russia and its allies. 
  In Warsaw, I called attention to the fact that the tension 
between Romania and Hungary as well as the failure to utilize 
the entire potential of Romanian-Polish relations only increase 
the level of danger for the `first-line' countries and for 
European security. Political factors should be concerned with 
eliminating `disputes' and utilizing, to best advantage, the 
potential of these countries for collaboration."

  [Text] President Sali Berisha received Kosovar President 
Ibrahim Rugova today. Both presidents discussed extensively the 
development of democratic reforms in Albania, problems related 
to the Albanian question, and the situation in the region. They 
considered important both for Albania and the region the last 
efforts of the Albanian Government to develop and strengthen 
regional cooperation and friendship with regional countries, 
such as Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the European 
Union countries, other European countries, and so forth. 
  Presidents Berisha and Rugova assessed as successful and 
important the visits and meetings of President Rugova in the 
North Atlantic Assembly, where the grave situation in Kosova and 
the possibilities of resolving this problem were addressed. The 
assembly meeting provided extensive support to the policy of 
Albanians in Kosova and their civil resistance against the 
Serbian occupation. 
  They also assessed as very important the visits and recent 
meetings of President Rugova with high-level government members 
and other officials in Denmark, Norway, France, and Germany. 
All these meetings revealed a great concern on the part of 
these countries regarding the violation of freedoms and national 
rights of the Albanians in Kosova and their determination to 
seriously contribute to resolving the Kosova question. 
  Both presidents assessed positively the serious efforts of 
the international community to establish a dialogue between 
Prishtina and Belgrade in the presence of a third party on the 
reestablishment and functioning of democratic institutions and 
the solution of Kosova's political status. They welcomed the 
efforts and indications that encourage the start of a dialogue. 
  Both presidents considered that the cooperation between 
Albania and Macedonia is important for peace and stability in 
the south of the Balkans. They were also of the opinion that 
Macedonia's membership in the CSCE as a member with full rights 
not only serves this state but provides a real impetus to a 
further respect for freedoms and human and national rights of 
the Albanians in Macedonia, which is a condition for the 
stability of this republic. 
  They considered as a very important step the implementation 
of the census, which is in conformity with the standards and 
criteria of the law recommended by the group of experts and 
approved by the Macedonian Parliament. 
  Both presidents think that Albania's relations with Greece 
are important both for the two countries and the region and that 
there exist real possibilities to resolve the disagreements 
through dialogue. Albania respects and is committed to 
respecting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the Greek 
minority. These rights, alongside those of the Albanians, have 
been subject to deeply spectacular positive changes and they 
will be further expanded in the future. 
  Both presidents also stressed that the freeing of aid for 
the 
balance of payments and the continuation of aid for Albania by 
the European Union is of extraordinary importance for the 
progress of the reforms in Albania and its active role in 
preserving peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party Deputy Chairman Servet </F>
Pellumbi by Timo Luto in Tirana; date not given -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Luto] A meeting organized 
by the Bulgarian Socialist Party was held in Sofia, in which a 
Socialist Party [PS] delegation took part. What was this meeting 
about and who were the participants from the Socialist Party? 
  [Pellumbi] Yes, I think this problem has been largely 
politicized by the mass media and has been presented as if a 
party meeting was held there between the PS representatives and 
representatives from the Serbian party. In fact, this was a 
scientific meeting where scholars from 13 countries 
participated. Two of our people took part: Luan Shahollari, a 
well-known economist, and Vasillaq Kureta, a philosopher and 
doctor of sciences who deals precisely with national and ethnic 
problems. 
  In the framework of this seminar, or rather scientific 
international meeting, these comrades met with all the 
participants of this conference. They met with the Serbian 
representatives, but it was not a meeting between the two 
parties. Our friends that were sent to Sofia had no status or 
mandate to hold party talks with representatives of the Serbian 
Socialist Party. That is why this was not a party meeting, but 
it was a meeting just like the meeting with all the participants 
in this conference, discussing well-known problems that the 
Balkans is facing. 
  As our friends have informed us, they presented to the 
Serbian representatives all our options on the national question 
and the Kosova issue by upholding the already well-known stances 
that the PS maintains but also predicted by other political 
forces, which are much or less the same. [passage omitted]

  [Text] [Announcer] Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien 
visited the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] Canadian troops in 
Visoko and met Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Sarajevo today. 
Nedzad Leko has the report. 
  [Leko] After the talks, the reporters were first addressed 
by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
  [Chretien] "The prime minister and I discussed the extremely 
complex situation. Everybody wants peace, but peace is hard to 
achieve. The prime minister explained all the difficulties on 
the road to peace: the history, the geography, the geopolitical 
situation; so this has been a very useful visit for me. Not only 
did I have the opportunity to meet the Canadian troops on their 
peace mission, but I also visited Sarajevo." 
  [Leko] Asked by reporters about Canada's stance on the 
lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, 
Jean Chretien said: 
  [Chretien] "In our view, the lifting of the embargo would 
not 
lead to peace." 
  [Leko] The reporters were interested in whether Canada would 
be ready to send additional troops, especially if France decided 
to withdraw. 
  [Chretien] "We made no commitments regarding either their 
deployment or withdrawal. Of course, if a peace deal is 
concluded, other countries -- Canada as well, perhaps -- will 
send additional troops." 
  [Leko] Prime Minister Silajdzic then commented on the 
contents of his talks with the Canadian prime minister. 
  [Silajdzic] ``The first and basic divergence of views 
concerns the embargo issue. The prime minister believes that the 
lifting of the arms embargo would heighten the risk of the 
outbreak of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while we believe that the 
embargo is illegal [words indistinct] -- if an illness is 
treated with a certain medicine for two years and the results 
are disastrous, as they are, then the medicine should be changed. 
  ``On the other hand, [words indistinct] to achieve peace. If 
we manage to achieve peace, there will be no problem. We are 
asking what happens if we do not achieve peace. Of course, the 
aggressor does not want peace and he is showing this perfectly 
clearly. 
  ``Our question to the prime minister is what to do if we do 
not achieve peace. Will we again disperse, as we did after the 
London conference, and say no deal or will we point our finger 
at the culprit and define the measures to be taken by the 
international community in the event that the aggressor rejects 
the peace plan. 
  "We believe that the supervision of our border with Serbia 
and Montenegro has come two years too late; if the international 
community had taken these measures two years ago, things would 
not be what they are today. It is still not too late for the 
international community to take serious measures for controlling 
the border with Serbia and Montenegro with the aim of stopping 
the aggression against our country."

  [Text] The Spanish Blue Helmets deployed in Bosnia on a 
peace mission have reopened the Neretva River route after three 
months of hard work. Slovak Blue Helmets deployed in the area 
also took part in this mission. 
  The reopening of the route means that the link between the 
Dalmatian coast and the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, has been 
reestablished. A floating bridge has been installed on the 
Bijela River to replace the one destroyed during the fighting 
between Croats and Muslims. 
  The UK's Michael Rose, commander of the Blue Helmets in the 
area, was at the bridge-opening ceremony where a plaque was 
unveiled in honor of the Blue Helmets, among whom are the 
Spaniards belonging to the Cordoba Group.

Presidency and vice president of the Bosniak-Croat Federation, 
who led our country's delegation at the talks in Geneva, 
returned to Sarajevo this afternoon. Upon his arrival Ejup 
Ganic gave a brief statement on the cease-fire agreement: 
  [Begin Ganic recording] We have done what the assembly asked 
us to do. As far as Gorazde and the talks on the four-week 
cease-fire are concerned, we did not agree to freeze [the 
positions] that the aggressors tried to impose on us with help 
from some UN circles, and we tried to decide on what was best 
for our country. 
  I must say straight away that some new ideas exist. If the 
arms embargo is not lifted there should be a reduction in 
armament. [end recording]

  [Text] Banja Luka, 9 Jun (TANJUG) -- The document signed in 
Geneva falls far below our expectations, far below what had been 
demanded, Aleksa Buha, minister of foreign affairs of the Srpska 
republic told the SRPSKI GLAS daily in Banja Luka today. 
  "The warring sides were requested in an imperative way to 
agree to a four-month cessation of hostilities in order to reach 
a political solution in the meantime, but the Muslim side did 
not accept it." In addition, the warring sides were requested 
to negotiate without setting any conditions, but the Muslim side 
did not abide by that either, Buha said. 
  "The Geneva document has been treated as the first step 
toward reaching an agreement on the cessation of hostilities, 
while negotiations to this end will begin in a few days," Buha 
said. "Another part of the agreement contains an obigation for 
the three sides to exchange POW's on the all-for-all principle 
in the meantime; that is, before the new round of negotiations."

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 10 June, just hours 
before the agreed one-month cease-fire is supposed take effect, 
reports the continuation of combat activities in the following 
areas: 
  The Information Service of the 107th Knightly Motorized 
Brigade Gradacac reports that "artillery attacks on Gradacac 
have continued since yesterday. During the visit by 
representatives of the Nordic Battalion, the aggressor fired 
more than 30 howitzer shells on the town itself." The shelling 
continued overnight at regular intervals and "a true cannonade 
started at 0400 this morning. From all directions and all types 
of arms, the aggressor has been attacking the lines of our 
fighters in Novalici, Vida, the industrial zone, Sibovac, Ukici, 
and Mionica. The tanks from Osmanovici, Gornje Krecane, Bucje, 
and Huskici are devastating the civilian installations in the 
town and the settlements on the outskirts. At the same time, 
projectiles from the howitzers of the largest-type calibers are 
pounding the town center. The defense positions are being 
attacked with mortars and it is estimated that some 800 
projectiles have landed on the free Gradacac territory." 
However, as the report says, "our fighters will not allow any 
surprises. Despite all these attacks, the defense lines are 
firm and stable." 
  "The enemy offensive on the defense lines of the 109th Doboj 
and 111th Gracanica Brigades has reached its climax in its ninth 
day," Izudin Durakovic says about the situation yesterday, 
claiming that "more than 1,000 projectiles from tanks, 
howitzers, mortars, recoiless guns, and antiaircraft arms" have 
been fired in the process. He reports that Gracanica itself was 
shelled in the afternoon, and continues to say that "although 
only a few hours are left before the agreed cease-fire is 
supposed to take effect, the behavior of Karadzic's criminals 
early this morning implies that the Chetniks are continuing with 
their old practice of saying one thing at the negotiating table 
and doing another on the ground." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from Brcko that "as the moment when 
the agreed cease-fire is supposed to come in effect on the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina fronts, the attacks of the Serbian aggressor 
on the Brcko battlefield are intensifying. The enemy's 
artillery attacks, accompanied by the intensified activities of 
the enemy infantry, directed at the positions of Brcko's 
defense, have continued in the course of the previous night." As 
he says, "the fighters of the 108th Motorized and 108th Infantry 
Brigades and the affiliated units of the 2d Corps did not carry 
out combat activities last night." Deronjic also notes the 
arrival of Serbian reinforcements and the regrouping of Serbian 
troops in the area overnight.

  [Text] A one-month cease-fire that was agreed in Geneva is 
coming into effect in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this very moment. 
However, reports coming from the front lines do not speak of 
peace. 
  As regards the Brcko area, Serb artillery attacks have been 
in progress since last night against civilian targets in 
Boderiste and deep into the free territory. Reconnaissance 
units of the 108th Infantry Brigade of the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO] of Brcko have reported that Serb tank 
reinforcements were being brought into the southeastern part of 
the Brcko area. 
  As regards the Orasje-Samac area, the Serb aggressor engaged 
in provocations from small infantry weapons, the Orasje 
operative zone of the HVO reported. They said that the Serb 
Army was continuing to bring in reinforcements south of the 
so-called corridor around Krepsic and Pelagicevo.

  [Text] Travnik, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 9 (AFP) -- If the 
latest ceasefire in the Bosnian conflict comes into effect 
Friday [10 June] as scheduled, it will force an end to one of 
the Moslem-led Bosnian army's most successful offensives of the 
war. For the first time, the Bosnian forces have broken through 
several Serb defense lines following several weeks of 
preparation, UN sources said. 
  In the north and west of the ex-Yugoslav republic, the army 
is poised to capture one strategic road, are advancing toward 
another, and are closing in on the town of Dornji Vakuf, which 
the Serbs captured at the start of the war, UN military 
observers in the field said. With the offensives underway, the 
Bosnian military command has barred foreign reporters from 
combat zones and tightened control on local media. It refuses 
to confirm reports of territorial gains and has sealed off 
entire sectors to UN peacekeepers and observers. 
  Analysts say the Bosnian army drive was made possible by the 
end of fighting between the Moslems and Croats, who have 
recently agreed to form a federation on territory under their 
control. "At many points along the front, (the government 
forces) are no longer the underdog or in a position of obvious 
inferiority thanks to troops released under an agreement with 
the Croats," a western military observer said. "They take the 
initiative and have learned, after two years of war, the 
importance of controlling information," he added. UN 
peacekeepers rely on estimates, helped by satellite pictures, to 
judge the success of the Bosnian army's first widescale 
offensive. 
  In the past few days, the fiercest fighting has been waged 
for control of what the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) call 
"route Duck," a strategic road linking two mainly Moslem regions 
in the northwest of the country and running through the Serb 
enclave of Ozren. If captured, it would enable the Moslems to 
link up the towns of Maglaj and Tesanj to Tuzla, Bosnia's second 
city, reducing the time needed to travel between them to two 
hours instead of the 12 it currently takes by a more circuitous 
route. By Thursday, after several days of coordinated infantry 
offensives to the west and east, the army had conquered several 
of the seven kilometers of the road from Serb forces, UN 
military experts estimated. "A victory on route Duck would have 
little military significance but an enormous psychological 
effect," a senior UNPROFOR officer in the region said. 
  Large contingents of Moslem troops have also been mobilized 
for the past two weeks fighting for control of another road -- 
running from the town of Teslic, south to the western front. 
Army shells have pummeled the road from surrounding crests for 
several days and an offensive to descend into the valley is 
probably underway. "We may well see a big effort by the Bosnian 
army over the next 48 hours to make the most of its winning hand 
before the ceasefire signed in Geneva comes into force -- that 
is if they intend to respect it," a UN officer told AFP. 
  The Serbs, Moslems and Croats agreed Wednesday in Geneva to 
observe a month-long ceasefire from Friday, under strong 
pressure from the United Nations. Like Teslic, Dornji Vakuf, 
also on the western front, appears on a list of seven towns that 
army chief General Rasim Delic says he will be able to 
"liberate" soon. On Wednesday the army had broken through Serb 
front lines and clashes were underway in villages outside the 
town. 
  Here in the nearby town of Travnik, a spokesman for 
headquarters of the army's 3rd corps denied Dornji Vakuf had 
fallen as troops just back from the front, carrying assault 
rifles and dressed in chemical- and germ-warfare resistant 
combat gear sat in groups on the sidewalks. In Sarajevo, 
UNPROFOR spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon said fighting died down 
somewhat along the main fronts in Bosnia as the truce agreement 
was signed in Geneva Wednesday. The Gradacac and Ribnica fronts 
in the north and Sapna, in the northeast, remained the most 
active in Bosnia but "compared to last week, these areas have 
shown a substantial decrease in the level of fighting," he said.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Draft Orders for All Officials in Croatian </F>
Institutions"] 
  [Text] Mostar -- The communal secretariats of Tuzla, 
Lukavac, Zivnica, and Banovici, have in the past few days opted 
for a forced mobilization of some 1,500 Croats into the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, Radio Herceg-Bosna reported on 
Wednesday. As reported by the correspondent of the Herceg-Bosna 
radio station in Tuzla, the military police of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 2d Corps -- after serving draft orders 
-- immediately transfers the Croats into the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army ranks and the military strongholds on Mt. Majevica and Mt. 
Konjuh. 
  The draft orders were served to high-ranking officials in 
all 
Croatian institutions. The Herceg-Bosna radio reports that among 
the mobilized are two members of the Croatian Democratic 
Community [HDZ] Regional Council in Tuzla, 14 presidents of HDZ 
branches, Josip Simic, president of the Croatian "Hrvatski Dom" 
Society, Drago Juric, manager of the "Sol" company, Janko 
Divkovic, president of the HDZ Youth in the Tuzla region, and 
the majority of members of the "GLASNIK HDZ SOLI" [newsletter] 
editorial board. The radio stresses that the consequence of 
this mobilization of Croats is their massive exodus from the 
region, in which they are aided by the Bosniak authorities, who 
are taking care of all the paperwork needed for leaving Tuzla. 
  Colonel-General Milivoj Petkovic, head of the Croatian 
Defense Council [HVO] General Staff in the Croatian Community of 
Herceg-Bosna, confirmed that a note on the mobilization of 
Croats had arrived from Tuzla on Tuesday. "We have informed 
Kresimir Zubak, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, 
about this," General Petkovic told Croatian Radio Herceg-Bosna 
on Wednesday, and added that this would "create numerous 
problems." General Petkovic assessed that this was "incorrect of 
the Muslim authorities," and that it was a "calculated move."

  [Text] Belgrade, 9 Jun (TANJUG) -- Vladimir Lukic, prime 
minister of the Srpska republic, today sent a letter to Yasushi 
Akashi, the UN secretary general's envoy for former Yugoslavia, 
expressing concern over the provocative conduct by UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] soldiers in the area of Gorazde. 
  The letter reads: 
  Your Excellency, 
  I would like to express profound concern over the situation 
in the three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde, created by 
hostile conduct by UN personnel toward the Serb civilian 
population. This problem was also present before, but it has 
exacerbated with the arrival of the Canadian troops in this 
area. On several occasions our civilians were ill-treated, even 
surrounded by armored vehicles and UN personnel, held at 
gun-point, had their personal belongings searched without 
authorization, and generally exposed to crude treatment. The 
most serious of all these problems is that the Canadian soldiers 
demand that the Serbs leave this zone, thus evicting them from 
their houses using brutal methods. We fear that such behavior 
is leading toward armed incidents with unforeseeable 
consequences. 
  The agreement on Gorazde does not authorize such treatment 
of 
Serb civilians. The prevailing impression among the civilians is 
that they will be gradually evicted from the area, which the UN 
will then hand over to the Muslims. Such unhealthy conditions 
can easily lead to incidents, and we believe that it is only a 
question of time when incidents will start occurring. 
  We are therefore suggesting that you forward this protest to 
the UNPROFOR military command and instruct the command to issue 
orders for the fair treatment of civilians in the 
three-kilometer exclusion zone around Gorazde. The situation is 
so serious that if no radical change takes place, we will either 
provide police escorts for our civilians or allow events to 
dictate the situation on the ground. Please treat this problem 
as one of exceptional importance. Thank you for your 
understanding. 
  Yours sincerely,Vladimir Lukic

aggressor's and Abdic's blockade of a part of the Velika Kladusa 
commune, the Bihac district has been in total humanitarian 
isolation since 17 May. The humanitarian aid convoys [word 
indistinct] Bosnia-Herzegovina were halted at the Turanj 
checkpoint near Karlovac, which is in Serbian hands. They would 
not allow passage to 20 convoys for Bihac, Cazin, Bosanska 
Krupa, and (?Buzim), even though this are convoys of the 
international humanitarian organizations. At the same time the 
humanitarian aid is passing for [words indistinct] Velika 
Kladusa without any problems. [passage omitted] 
  Instead of 15 kg, the residents of this region have been 
receiving only 7 kg of food per month. Now the situation is 
deteriorating rapidly. Food and other essentials are in short 
supply for nearly 300,000 residents of the Bihac district.

<F P=106> [Report by S. Lalovic: "Arms Dealer Arrested"] </F>
  [Text] Pale, 3 June -- The smuggling of arms and 
ammunition -- arriving in the Muslim part of Sarajevo under the 
auspices of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] -- is an ongoing 
phenomenon, and the latest event in the Kasindolska Street has 
only confirmed that. Mufid Halilovic, one of five arms dealers, 
was arrested during a routine control at a Serbian Army 
checkpoint and admitted that Alija Izetbegovic, Haris Silajdzic, 
and Irfan Ljubijankic are directly involved in the arms trade. 
  According to Halilovic, they did so during their many visits 
abroad and most frequently at peace conferences. A former 
student of the Machine Faculty, Halilovic also claims that 
Frankfurt airport is the main center from which the weapons, 
well packed and camouflaged, were delivered. He himself was a 
coordinator for humanitarian aid at a U.S. military base in that 
city, which made his job in arms dealing easier. 
  Halilovic also says that, together with Italian citizen 
Andre 
Andjeli, as well as Sulejman Catovic, Sead Kulic, and Saban 
Salcinovic, he freely obtained arms and ammunition from Ploce in 
Croatia and then brought them, via the "Blue Road," to Sarajevo. 
All this was, according to him, carried out under UNPROFOR 
protection, and the people who participated in this had UNPROFOR 
press cards on them, which enabled them to move over virtually 
the entire territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and even 
beyond, that is, abroad. 
  This only confirms the former knowledge that hundreds of 
people in the Muslim part of Sarajevo who have nothing to do 
with the public media possess UNPROFOR press cards that enable 
them to use transporters and helicopters to be transferred to 
desired places. As a comparison, only six people working for 
Serbian Radio and Television possess these press cards.

<F P=106> [Article by A.K.: "Economists on `Strategy for Poland'; </F>
Neither a Plan nor a Declaration"] 
  [Text] "It is not my ambition to go down in history. I do, 
however, want to resolve a few problems that are a burden on the 
economy. I will not allow a few dozen other issues to be 
included in this program. I have selected 10," said Deputy 
Prime Minister Kolodko after hearing economists' questions and 
remarks concerning the "Strategy for Poland." The deputy prime 
minister took part in a meeting at the Polish Economic Society, 
which was held on 8 June in Warsaw. 
  Many controversies were aroused by the unemployment 
counteracting program. A decrease in the unemployment rate, 
which was envisioned in the program, to a level of 14 percent 
was said to be too low. It was also stressed that it is not 
possible to lower the inflation rate and the unemployment rate 
at the same time. The goal to work toward should be to lower 
unemployment, whereas combating inflation is merely a means 
leading to the achievement of this goal. Therefore, a "monetary 
expansion" should not be feared. 
  Many statements suggested that the "Strategy for Poland" is 
too optimistic. Participants of the meeting listed the 
conditions that should be met so that implementation of the 
programs is possible--"to mobilize savings"; "to extend the 
investment blockade"; "to increase the inflow of foreign capital 
and to create conditions for investors"; "to improve the 
competitiveness of the economy and, following the Japanese 
model, to set up a foreign trade council"; "to immediately 
embark on a program of investing in human capital"; "to extend 
the guarantees for deposits in all banks"; "to prepare 
substitute policies, when it turns out that, for instance, there 
are new possibilities." 
  As Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said, the "Strategy for 
Poland" is supposed to inform both households and all companies, 
as well as foreign investors, about the intentions of the Polish 
Government. They should know what they can count on. This is 
exemplified by the tax on immovable property, which has been 
blown up into sensational news, despite the fact that work on it 
was started by previous governments. The ministry is conducting 
such work; however, it will be the Sejm that decides what taxes 
and when they will be introduced. We want to develop housing, 
said the deputy prime minister, and we will not tamper with the 
fiscal system in such a way as to impede this sector. 
  There exist very acute conflicts between employment and 
inflation or between unemployment and inflation. These are more 
political than economic decisions. The "Strategy for Poland" 
proposes lowering these two rates, both the inflation rate and 
the unemployment rate, which is possible. Right now, however, 
it seems that of greater importance is the quicker lowering of 
the inflation rate--to less than 10 percent by 1997. This is 
more real than lowering the unemployment rate to this level. 
  The government is not going to grant a state loan, as was 
done, for example, before World War II for implementation of the 
program. The country's debts are too great debt to afford such 
measures. Therefore, I do not want to accept credits without any 
consideration, the deputy prime minister said. 
  The announced consolidation of banks, which also causes 
concern, is indispensable because of competition. Even the 
largest Polish companies are simply small compared to Western 
firms. It is not true that there are surpluses in this year's 
budget. The revenues are indeed greater. However, for example, 
the valorization of retirement and disability pensions costs 2.5 
trillion zlotys [Z] a month, which totals approximately Z30 
trillion per year. The budget participates in this. Now, if it 
turned out that there are really some surpluses, I would prefer 
to spend them primarily in such a way as to partially lessen the 
debt burden of the education or health sector, said Deputy Prime 
Minister Kolodko. 
  Grzegorz Kolodko said that, for the time being, there is no 
need to amend the budget, which does not mean, however, that 
there cannot be any changes in the future. "I will certainly 
not propose it this month," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Krajewski and INA: "Will the Situation Be </F>
That Good?; `Strategy for Poland' Is Being Criticized--Many 
Economists Have Doubts Whether Inflation and Unemployment Can Be 
Reduced at the Same Time"] 
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko admits that 
"Strategy for Poland" is "a bit optimistic." He does not expect 
taxes on stock market transactions to result in substantial 
revenue for the state budget. He is not sure whether it will be 
possible to lower income tax rates in 1995. 
  Today, Sejm deputies will make a decision on whether Deputy 
Prime Minister/Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is to present 
in the Sejm a governmental economic program for the years 
1994-97 called "Strategy for Poland." Last night, opposition 
representatives in the Sejm Leadership [Konwent Seniorow] spoke 
out against a suggestion coming from the Sejm speaker for the 
program to be presented without a parliamentary debate on it. 
The governing coalition wanted to postpone the debate by two 
weeks, meaning until after the self-governmental elections. 
Kolodko announced his Sejm speech a few hours earlier, during a 
meeting with some economists in Warsaw. 
<H5>  10 Main Points </H5>
  According to Kolodko, the main feature of "Strategy" is an 
"extension of the economic time frame." The program includes 10 
main theses, followed by 10 main programs [programy wezlowe] 
that elaborate on the theses. Kolodko regards the need to lower 
the social cost of the reforms as one of the more important 
issues. This will require concentrating, among other things, on 
achieving rapid economic growth. Other important issues 
include: negotiation principles of the distribution of the 
results of labor, improvement in living conditions, reforms of 
the center, and increasing the Polish economy's competitiveness. 
<H5>  Important Figures </H5>
  Each main program contains criteria of execution. "Strategy" 
envisages achieving 22-percent growth of the GDP over four 
years. "This means that the GDP will increase by $365 per 
resident, reaching the level of $3,500 in 1997," Kolodko said. 
Over the same time period, consumption will rise by 16 percent 
and investments by about 32 percent. Unemployment is to go down 
from 16 to 14 percent. In 1997, inflation should not exceed 10 
percent. 
<H5>  Economists' Doubts </H5>
  According to the economists taking part in the meeting, it 
will be hard to achieve the goals set forth in "Strategy." A 
few of them pointed to the need to conduct a restructuring of 
state-owned enterprises soon. Professor Pawel Glikman said 
that, in Poland, capital intensity of production in state-owned 
industry is four times that of privately owned industry and 
that, when it comes to the construction industry, it is even 
seven times higher. Professor Urszula Plowiec warned that 
Polish enterprises may not meet the challenge of foreign 
competition once customs duties are decreased by 20 percent next 
year. The possibility of lowering the unemployment rate was 
subject to particular skepticism during the meeting. That is 
because restructuring and increasing the competitiveness of 
Polish enterprises will require employment cuts. A majority of 
economists are also leaning toward the view that measures aimed 
at lowering inflation result in increased unemployment. 
<H5>  What Taxes Will Be Like </H5>
  Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said he is aware that the 
program is a bit optimistic but that, if a concerted effort is 
made, it is implementable. When asked about a possible 
amendment to this year's budget, Kolodko said that, so far, 
revenue surpluses are not big enough to be able to carry out 
such an amendment of the budget law. He confirmed that he would 
like to lower personal income tax rates as early as next year, 
but he does not know where to get the 3.5-4 trillion zlotys [Z] 
to cover the decreased budget revenue that would result from 
such a measure. He was trying to convince his listeners that 
taxing stock market transactions will not endanger the stability 
of the Polish capital market, nor will it improve the lot of 
senior citizens. He expects Z1 trillion from the stock market 
tax next year, whereas the valorization of retirement pensions 
by 12 percent to be carried out in June will cost the state 
budget Z2.5 trillion. 
<H5>  President Approved </H5>
  "Generally speaking, I mean in terms of the main directions, 
Lech Walesa approved the `Strategy for Poland,'" Kolodko stated 
after a meeting with the president. Kolodko said that the 
president received the "Strategy" with enormous interest: "He 
asked me a whole list of specific questions that were geared to 
making sure that his earlier proposals and suggestions were 
included in the plan. I think to a large extent they were," 
said Kolodko.

    [Editorial Report] An article in the 26 April issue of the 
Warsaw daily POLSKA ZBROJNA comments on the impact the 
increasing rate of unemployment is having on Polish society and 
criticizes the government's approach to dealing with this 
problem. Referring to an accompanying map of Poland that 
indicates those districts (mostly in northern Poland) suffering 
from the highest levels of unemployment with black shading, 
journalist Elzbieta Szmigielska-Jezierska writes that 
"unemployment is growing in Poland, and the black stain is 
getting larger. In some regions, the rate is over 20 percent, 
and this is alarming." Szmigielska-Jezierska finds disturbing 
the fact that the 30-to-44-year-old age group has been the most 
severely affected by unemployment: "The tragic aspect of our 
condition is underlined by the fact that this age group is being 
hit the hardest. These are people in the prime of their 
lives.... If all of these people are useless to the country, a 
country that must intensively modernize its economy, are we a 
lost nation?" 
  Szmigielska-Jezierska notes that, in addition to the 
2,900,000 registered unemployed (15.7 percent of the 
population), an even larger number pf "hidden" unemployed are on 
the payroll of factories where they have nothing productive to 
do. The extent of this overmanning, which is made possible by 
large government subsidies, is estimated at approximately 5.5 
million. 
  Szmigielska-Jezierska finds fault with the government and, 
in 
particular, with Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social 
policy, for relying on large welfare appropriations to alleviate 
the results of unemployment rather than coming to grips with its 
root causes. She describes the relief payments as "manna from 
heaven," which will not provide a lasting solution to Poland's 
unemployment problem.

<F P=106> [Article by Adam Koronowski] </F>
  [Text] The companies that produce telecommunications 
equipment in Poland have found themselves in an extremely 
difficult situation in the "transition stage." The problem has 
mainly been that there has been no chance to reach a 
technological and organizational level that would allow them to 
compete on the Polish and foreign markets with the well-known 
foreign manufacturers. 
  To illustrate this point, let us compare the potential of 
the 
Polish telecommunications industry to that of foreign 
manufacturers. The combined sales of five Polish enterprises 
covered by the privatization policy--i.e., "Telfy" SA 
[Incorporated], "Teletry" SA, PZT SA, ZWUT SA, and "Elwro" SA 
(this group is not fully devoted to 
telecommunications)--amounted to just under $60 million per year 
(in 1992). Sales in 1991 of public telecommunications systems 
(to include only exchanges and transmission units) amounted to 
almost $8 billion for Alcatel, $6 billion for AT&amp;T, and only 
slightly less for Siemens. For all of these companies, this 
accounted for only a portion of their overall sales, which 
amounted to approximately $20 billion (Alcatel), about $14 
billion (AT&amp;T), and $44 billion (Siemens). Because of these 
production volumes, these companies are able to allocate $3-5 
billion annually to research and development. As we see, this 
amount exceeds the value of the sales of the entire Polish 
telecommunications industry by several orders of magnitude. 
<H5>  Financial Problems </H5>
  Polish companies that produce telecommunications equipment 
and, in particular, exchanges for the public net have found 
themselves in serious financial straits. An example of this is 
Warszawskie Zaklady Wytworcze Urzadzen Telekomunikacyjnych, ZWUT 
[Warsaw Telecommunications Equipment Production Plants], a 
company with roots in the sector that extend very far back and 
that has a considerable share of the market. In 1992, its losses 
amounted to 41 billion zloty [Z], and for the first half of 1993 
to Z81 billion. Faced with scant prospects for developing and 
selling its main product, the Pentaconta analog exchange, ZWUT 
quickly approached the brink of bankruptcy. A total of 2,600 
workers were laid off. The losses of the "Elwro" enterprise 
amounted to Z185 billion in 1992, and to Z90 billion over the 
first six months of 1993. The enterprise found itself in a 
similar situation, which meant layoffs for 1,200 people. The 
"Telfa" enterprise, which was sold previously, also racked up 
losses. During the last half of the year before "Telfa" was 
sold, losses amounted to Z20 billion. Only PZT and "Teletra" 
were operating near the breakeven point, but even they have few 
prospects of surviving on the market. 
  At the same time, the domestic demand in this area is, as we 
know, tremendous. The poor state of Polish telecommunications is 
not only a source of daily frustration but also by itself one of 
the most serious barriers to attracting foreign capital to 
Poland. 
  It is estimated that, by the year 2000, an average of 
600,000 
new lines will be installed per year, at an average cost of 
$1,500 per line. This means that the value of telecommunications 
deliveries to the Polish market will be approximately $900 
million per year, of which about $240 million will be for 
exchanges, transmission equipment, and related services. This 
last group is a market segment covered by regulations that are 
to be introduced. 
<H5>  Auction Card </H5>
  Everything seemed to indicate that the benefits of the rapid 
modernization and development of the Polish communications 
system would go to foreign companies, while the Polish ones 
would not survive. In addition, the uncontrolled proliferation 
of foreign suppliers on the Polish market would create the 
danger of introducing too many switching systems offered by the 
respective manufacturers. In Western Europe, there are two or 
three systems in operation in each country. In these countries, 
this equipment has resulted from many years of natural selection. 
  It should be emphasized that the situation of Polish 
companies that manufacture exchanges for the public network has 
not attracted a great deal of interest from foreign capital. 
True, partnerships with foreign capital interests have been 
active in some of them, but the foreign shareholders have not 
been interested in expanding their investments under the 
existing conditions. 
  Assuming correctly that the powerful auction card the Polish 
side has to play is the opportunity to sell equipment on an 
eager Polish market, two solutions present themselves that would 
allow foreign companies to profit from access to this market, 
provided conditions are ensured for Polish manufacturers to 
develop. First, the order from the Minister of Communications 
requires that deliveries of switching equipment for the public 
network have a 50-percent national content. Second, a decision 
made by KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers] in 
October 1992 directs that the number of installed remote 
switching systems, as well as the number of suppliers, be 
limited to three. These suppliers, according to the KERM 
decision, are to be selected during the course of the 
privatization of the group of Polish telecommunications 
enterprises that is to be carried out in three transactions. 
What has been accomplished in the natural course of events in 
many countries has, in Poland, had to be carried out in a way 
that is regulated and makes it possible to avoid "creative 
chaos." 
  The solution that has been adopted has assured foreign 
companies access to the Polish market by putting it up for 
auction in connection with the acquisition of Polish 
enterprises. Investment commitments that investors have given in 
a buy-sell agreement, as well as the requirement for national 
content, ensure that the access gained to the market will be 
turned into a way of guaranteeing the development of production 
in Poland. 
<H5>  Theory and Practice </H5>
  Let us take a look at the first of the tools utilized in 
this 
connection: the requirement for 50-percent national content. 
  In this regard, it was assumed that each of the three 
suppliers would capture one-third of the Polish market--i.e., 
would sell the equipment that is needed for the installation of 
200,000 lines per year. It would then be necessary to answer the 
question of how much of the production volume could be handled 
effectively in Poland. It would also be necessary to outline the 
possibilities for contributing to deliveries of equipment to the 
national market. Finally, it would be necessary to estimate the 
impact of Polish price realities on the altered cost structure 
in relation to the altered structure of the same costs abroad. 
Of course, all of this research required consideration of the 
time factor for estimating when the pledged level of national 
content could be achieved. 
  As a result of the research based on the methodology 
outlined 
above (the research, a portion of which is presented here, was 
carried out by Bain &amp; Co. at the request of the MPW 
[Ministry of 
Privatization]), it was found that achieving the target national 
content of 50 percent would not be possible from the technical 
standpoint unless the investors were allowed to include in the 
shipping cost to Poland the price paid for the shares of the 
Polish telecommunications enterprises acquired. This is, in 
fact, the solution that was adopted in the order from the 
Minister of Telecommunications. The order also allowed a period 
of three years for the required level of national content to be 
reached. At the expiration of this period, fulfillment of this 
requirement will be verified by an independent unit on behalf of 
the Ministry of Communications. The equipment suppliers are also 
obliged to file annual reports. 
  As we know, requiring a specified national content is a 
protectionist tool. Consequently, in theory, it would lead to an 
increase in the costs of production and the prices for the 
equipment. It turns out, however, that, in the situation in 
question, the risk is not so great. First, it should be 
emphasized that the commitment for the successful suppliers to 
capture one-third of the market does not mean that access to 
this much of the market is awarded to them. On the contrary, all 
suppliers who emerge during the course of privatization are 
entitled to the same access to the market, not just a certain 
share allocated to them. This means that they will be obliged to 
compete in auctions organized by the operators (Telekomunikacje 
Polska, SA). This will undoubtedly put strong downward pressure 
on prices. 
  Next, we should recall that, in outlining the extent of 
national content, consideration was given to how much of the 
equipment could be produced effectively (i.e., at competitive 
prices) in Poland at the intended scale of production. The 
requirement for national content is not supposed to become a 
pretext for obsolete and expensive local products because it 
applies to manufacturers who are world leaders in terms of the 
development of technology in the telecommunications area. 
Finally, it should be emphasized that the order from the 
Minister of Communications calls for controls on supplier 
pricing practices, as well as on technology transfer. 
  The second of the solutions implemented (linking market 
access to the acquisition of Polish enterprises that produce 
telecommunications equipment) is certainly better known because 
it was the subject of press items that appeared at the time the 
regular transactions were completed. Just remember that the 
right of exclusive access to the market was granted for a term 
of six years to the suppliers whose systems have already been 
adopted in Poland and who made the purchases within the 
framework of one of the three proposed transactions. The objects 
of these purchases were packages of 80 percent of the shares of 
"Telfa" in Bydgoszcz, "Teletra" in Poznan, and PZT and ZWUT in 
Warsaw, to which "Elwro" in Wroclaw was also added by decision 
of KERM. The buyers were, respectively, the U.S. concern 
AT&amp;T, 
Alcatel SESA from Spain, and Siemens from Germany. All of these 
firms are world leaders in the field of telecommunications. 
  In discussing the results of the three transactions 
together, 
we note that the sale of 80 percent of the shares of the five 
enterprises funneled $70 million into the state budget, and the 
buyers pledged to invest $162 million over six years, subject to 
agreed-upon penalties [for failing to do so] and to raise the 
paid-in capital by a total of $70 million over two years. They 
also guaranteed jobs for 5,600 workers for 18 months. 
  These transactions do not, of course, encompass the entire 
telecommunications industry. Additional privatization 
transactions are also slated for this sector of industry. The 
most important decision that will have to be made, however, 
pertains to the fate of the main operator in Poland, 
Telekomunikacja Polska SA, which holds a monopoly position.

<F P=106> [Article compiled by E.W.: "Association Like Republican </F>
Party; Zbigniew Religa Wants To Transform BBWR"] 
  [Text] According to Zbigniew Religa, chairman of the 
Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR], the association has 
failed to fulfill its task of uniting the entire right wing. 
That was not possible, Religa explained in an interview for 
PAP. A meeting of BBWR's founding members to debate the formula 
and structure of a future organization will take place before 
the end of the month. Religa does not rule out that the new 
organization will include people who have left other right-wing 
parties and who are acting on their own now or who have 
abandoned political activity completely. 
  It cannot be an organization that would be exclusively for 
Lech Walesa and that would be associated with him because, in 
that case, it would lose its significance both if the president 
wins the election and if he loses it, Religa explained. He also 
stressed that the bloc being organized now cannot be an 
organization that would be linked to himself or to Andrzej 
Olechowski, either; instead, it must be a group with a clear 
program and goals. 
  There is no doubt whatsoever that, if my concept and 
direction are supported by the majority, then, beginning at that 
point, work will begin on transforming the BBWR into a new 
party, Religa said. He added that both BBWR members and poeple 
from outside it who could take part in the future organization 
will debate the group's new formula. When explaining the 
reasons for the decision, the BBWR chairman said that, in its 
current form, the BBWR could not be an organization that could 
make its mark in Poland's political landscape permanently--that 
is to say, over the next 10-50 years. Religa admitted that he 
still has an incomplete idea of what the future group should 
look like. But he did stress that he would not like it to 
resemble a party in the classic sense of the word--meaning, 
identification cards or various types of party commissions. I 
like the concept of, for instance, the Republican Party in the 
United States the most.

<F P=106> [Article by Bernadeta Waszkielewicz and Pawel Reszka: "The </F>
Council for the Press; Is There a Threat of Return of 
Censorship?"] 
  [Text] The opinions on the idea of setting up a council 
for the press are quite varied: 
  --It is an attempt to reestablish censorship. 
  --Someone should watch, within reasonable limits, over the 
values or opinions promoted by the press, say politicians of 
various political stripes about the proposal submitted by 
Democratic Left Alliance Deputy Adam Halber. The basic 
controversies are: Is it necessary to watch over the press? 
Should the press market be protected from foreign capital? 
Eventually, if the council were to exist, who would set it 
up--the authorities or the journalists themselves? 
  Someone should watch, "within reasonable limits," over the 
values or opinions promoted by the press, believes Janusz 
Dobrosz, deputy chairman of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], who 
accepts the idea of establishing a council for the press. 
"There is a difference between respecting general values and 
imposing, offending, and slandering. We have pluralism, and the 
press is shaping public opinion." 
  Asked about whether the council will not be a form of 
censorship, Dobrosz replies that it will not, but "the 
informative proportions are so distorted that not the political 
opposition but the opposition to our views has a greater share 
in the media." Dobrosz did not firmly deny the suggestion that 
the role of the council would be to ensure influence of the 
governing coalition over the press. He explained that he 
believes that "the government must have its own press, which is 
exemplified by the governmental page in RZECZPOSPOLITA, because 
someone must present" the activities, intentions, and opinions 
of the government, not only this government "because this one 
will eventually leave, but every government." "This is a lack 
of balance, it is absurd and inadmissible." 
  According to M.A. Jerzy Adamowski of the Journalism 
Institute, it is possible for a press council to function in the 
Polish reality. It should not deal with disputes between 
journalists and politicians. This should be handled by courts 
of law. 
  Krzysztof Krol of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland 
opposes the idea of setting up the council. He fears that the 
idea of establishing the press council is "an attempt to 
recreate the former censorship." "Such a council would soon get 
the idea of creating types of press `space slots'--that is, 
calculating who appeared in the press and how many times. It 
would be a kiss of death for journalism. There is a great 
difference between a civil servant and a journalist; these two 
should not be confused." 
  A negative attitude toward the council has also been adopted 
by Zdobyslaw Milewski of the Freedom Union. He considers the 
idea of establishing a press council to be misconceived because 
it aims at regulating the free media from the position of the 
state authorities. 
  Comparison with the National Council of Radio and Television 
[KRRiT] is also not a very good one because it deals with the 
regulation of the affairs concerning radio stations, where there 
is not enough space for everyone. 
  Presidential Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski also is not an 
advocate of the idea of establishing the council. "I do not 
think it could be a panacea for the problems that journalists 
themselves cannot resolve today." 
<H5>  The Protection of the Press Market </H5>
  According to the author of the idea, among the fields of 
activity of the press council should also be the protection of 
the press market from the influx of foreign capital. There is 
no agreement over this issue as well. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, of 
the Center Accord, claims that a lack of inflow of foreign 
capital would conserve the advantage of the postcommunist forces 
on the press market. Kaczynski would back the idea of admitting 
a greater amount of foreign capital to the Polish market, which, 
he believes, might result in greater pluralism. This, among 
other reasons, is why he objects to the establishment of the 
council. He does support the idea of setting up a nonparty body 
that would be entitled to impose prohibitive taxes, for 
instance, as a result of which obscene magazines would not be a 
good source of income. 
  Ignacy Rutkiewicz, president of the Polish Association of 
Journalists [SDP], says that it is absurd to limit the inflow of 
foreign capital in a free market economy. 
  The PSL's Janusz Dobrosz is of a different opinion: "The 
penetration of the Polish press by foreign capital is too great; 
proportions have been distorted," and some organ should control 
this issue. Jerzy Adamowski believes that the press council 
might deal with the protection of the Polish capital on the 
press market (during a transition period, it would protect 
periodicals from the dumping prices of competitors). It might 
also prevent the concentration of capital, and deal with the 
journalists' ethics and disputes between publishers and 
journalists. 
<H5>  Authorities' Attempts To Gain Influence Over the Press </H5>
  Jerzy Adamowski says that the council should be independent 
of politicians. It should consist of "persons of public 
confidence," representatives of publishers, and of journalists, 
and, if this cannot be avoided, of politicians. However, the 
latter should not have the greatest say. It would be a threat 
to the council if politicians wanted to gain influence over the 
media through it. SDP head Ignacy Rutkiewicz concedes that 
there are various opinions among journalists on the 
establishment of the press council. Some of them firmly oppose 
this idea; others say that the council should be established. 
However, it cannot be established by the government's decision; 
nor can it be formed in line with the special party-political 
system (as it was in the case of KRRiT). It should rather be an 
expression of the will of the journalist's milieu. 
  It would have to be situated within the press law. It should 
not be established in a separate law--one drafted in the fast 
mode, at that--provided that journalists themselves decided that 
such a council should be established.

  [Excerpt] I will not accept the resignation of Minister 
Andrija Hebrang, Prime Minister Nikica Valentic said at a 
Croatian Government session, which is still underway. Jasenka 
Dudic is on the phone with a report. 
  [Dudic] The program which is being implemented in the health 
service is part of the overall stabilization program, so I -- 
just like Dr. Hebrang -- would as a man of principles refuse to 
head the government if that program was brought into question. 
Prime Minister Valentic said this when he refused the 
minister's resignation and announced a discussion of the 
situation in the health service for the next session. He 
stressed that the government would not allow anarchy in the 
health service. The prime minister admitted that opposition to 
the stabilization program has been much greater than the 
government has admitted before, and that there is still some 
opposition on the part of those who oppose order. 
  Concerning prices, they are under control, and the 
government's message to those who have increased them is to 
reduce prices to previous levels, or the state will intervene. 
  The Croatian Government has adopted two-phase emergency 
measures for improving the water supply to Zadar and Biograd. 
Over the past two years the government has done everything to 
provide the water supply to those two towns, Prime Minister 
Valentic and Deputy Prime Minister Seks stressed. However, we 
have to exert additional pressure on UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] because they did not do anything to improve the water 
supply and protect the Kakme source, thus enabling the crime 
against humanitarian law. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Stjepan Mesic has lodged a protest with the Croatian 
Constitutional Court, requesting the protection of his 
constitutional rights. Mesic suggests that the Constitutional 
Court should annul the decision of the Chamber of Deputies of 
the Assembly of 24 May this year, whereby the president 
[speaker] of the chamber was relieved of duty. The protest note 
was received in the Constitutional Court today, and Stjepan 
Mesic's office distributed it to journalists in the Croatian 
Assembly. 
  In his protest note Mesic explained why he postponed the 
18th 
session of the Chamber of Deputies and stressed that, when the 
president was relieved of duty, provisions of the Constitution 
and the Chamber's code of practice--that is, the constitutional 
rights of the speaker of the chamber and the procedure for 
adopting documents on relieving him of duty--were violated.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic Movement, by Eva Zelenayova; place and date not 
given: "Leave Politics? No, I Do Not Think So"] 
  [Excerpts] [Zelenayova] It is often said, in connection 
with the Slovak political scene, that the problem is not so much 
the differences between the programs of the political entities 
as the incompatibility between their leaders. You have managed 
to overcome this obstacle with regard to Peter Weiss. Do you 
think this is also possible with regard to Vladimir Meciar? 
  [Carnogursky] I will begin with the past. I got to know 
Vladimir Meciar in 1990, when he was Slovak interior minister 
and I was federal deputy prime minister. We got on quite well, 
and some SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA readers may recollect that two or 
three weeks before his first recall, in April 1991, Meciar said 
in SMENA that, of all of the deputy prime ministers in his 
government at that time, he got on best with me. When he was 
recalled, I extended the benefits arising from his office 
twofold. He was given a state apartment on Fr. Kral Street in 
Bratislava. However, after his recall, Meciar started to call 
for a general strike and, at Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] meetings, he began to say that the Carnogursky family was 
enriching itself. In July 1992, Meciar sent us back into the 
past, and, even before this, in the fall of 1990, despite the 
coalition agreements with the then Public Against Violence [VPN] 
Movement, he forced our interior minister, Anton Andras, from 
the government. He persuaded the VPN to drive out the Christian 
Democratic Movement [KDH] from the government and tried to 
govern as a minority. And so on and so on. The problem with 
Meciar is that he does not stick to agreements, and, therefore, 
it is impossible to reach a reliable agreement with him on 
anything. That is the difference between him and Peter Weiss. 
If Vladimir Meciar were capable of guaranteeing that he would 
stick to the agreements he makes with other people, of course, 
it would be possible, as you say, to overcome the obstacle with 
regard to him, too. I am afraid that, for personal reasons, 
Meciar is incapable of this. 
  [Zelenayova] In politics, you can never say that something 
is impossible. 
  [Carnogursky] I am not stating this categorically, after 
all; it is just highly probable. 
  [Zelenayova] Part of Slovak society, at home and abroad, has 
grave reservations about you. You yourself, however, have been 
the cause of this--for example, by the statement: "I always put 
on the mask I need to put on," which can be interpreted in 
various ways. Your hesitation in issues concerning the 
independent Slovak state, the assessment of the recent past, and 
the approach to Andrej Hlinka is known. People abroad, in 
particular, or, rather, Slovaks abroad, find very hard to bear 
your assessment of the effect of the 250,000 Czechs in Slovakia 
after 1918 and your statement that "the fact that the Czechs had 
to leave Slovakia in the years 1938-39 is a black mark on Slovak 
history." They even consider this to be an indelible black mark 
on your character. Have you not contemplated leaving politics? 
  [Carnogursky] You have taken the quotation about the masks 
out of context, but let us deal with the statement about the 
Czechs. I used it as a rejoinder to a televised address by 
former Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart, who expressed his 
regret about the Czechoslovakism that had manifested itself 
during the First Republic. With regard to the evacuation of the 
Czechs in the years 1938-39, it would perhaps be possible to 
cite various extenuating circumstances, consisting, for example, 
of the fact that, following the birth of the Czechoslovak 
Republic, the Czechs filled posts in Slovakia that, in fact, 
morally, politically, and socially belonged to Slovaks. The 
problem is that they were evacuated at a time when their country 
was under the immediate threat of occupation by the German Army, 
so Slovakia should have demonstrated its solidarity with the 
Czech lands. [passage omitted] Quite simply, Slovakia should 
not have done this at a time when the Czech lands were being 
occupied by the German Army. We have to realize that an 
arrogant attitude toward our neighbors does not strengthen 
Slovakia's defensive capability and does not serve its 
interests; it simply harms us. 
  [Zelenayova] Do you not even think it is necessary to defend 
ourselves against the arrogance of neighbors? 
  [Carnogursky] Defend ourselves yes, but expressing regret 
about something that we have done, something that has caused 
pain to others, is always a virtue. 
  [Zelenayova] I will return to my question. Have you not 
ever contemplated leaving politics? 
  [Carnogursky] I have not. 
  [Zelenayova] Judging by the public opinion polls and the 
envisaged preelection groupings of the left, the right, and the 
parties around the HZDS, what kind of development would you 
forecast after the elections? 
  [Carnogursky] Four months before the elections, I can only 
say that an HZDS election victory, one that would bring the HZDS 
to power, would place Slovakia in the kind of isolation it would 
be difficult to get out of. 
  [Zelenayova] Why do you think this? 
  [Carnogursky] Because of the HZDS's incompetent past and 
present policy and Meciar's tainted reputation, especially 
abroad. 
  [Zelenayova] Some correspondents depict the HZDS victory in 
1992 as an apocalypse. However, the HZDS victory in 1992 
heralded the nationalist orientation and led to the creation of 
the independent Slovak state. It could be said, then, that they 
are accusing the HZDS of breaking up the Federation. Do you 
also view the movement like this? 
  [Carnogursky] The HZDS victory in 1992 merely signaled a 
change of course in the nationalist issue, the speeding up of 
certain development in the sense that Slovak independence was 
achieved outside the framework of European integration. There 
is a difference. 
  [Zelenayova] Nevertheless, all of the European states that 
felt they had to become independent were established at this 
time. 
  [Carnogursky] Yes, you are right, but they are also 
experiencing the appropriate difficulties, which would not have 
happened if they had broken away within the process of European 
integration. [passage omitted] 
  [Zelenayova] The right has not yet reached an agreement on a 
joint course of action before the elections. The KDH is pushing 
its proposal for an open list of candidates. The Democratic 
Party [DS] and the Party of Entrepreneurs and Businessmen are, 
alternatively, pushing for an open coalition. Why is it 
unacceptable for the KDH to go into the elections along with the 
other nonleftist parties? 
  [Carnogursky] You mean in the form of a coalition bloc? 
  [Zelenayova] Yes. 
  [Carnogursky] According to the election law, an election 
bloc means an increase in the percentage of votes required for 
entry into parliament; however, merging parties at the level of 
a bloc has, until now, always meant a reduction in the 
preferential percentage compared with the original situation. 
For example, according to the public opinion polls, the DS had 
2 percent, although each of the parties that had merged within 
it had, on their own, 2 and more percent. This certainly 
concerns the Democratic Union [DU] and, according to the May 
public opinion polls, which were conducted by the radio and also 
canvassed support for the election blocs, all of them, with the 
exception of the left--that is, the so-called national bloc and 
the so-called right-wing bloc--had less support than the total 
support for the parties participating independently. Therefore, 
I think our offer is simply better and, finally, that the issue 
also involves the fact that Slovakia needs clearly crystallized 
parties. At the moment, this applies to only the Party of the 
Democratic Left and the KDH. 
  [Zelenayova] Despite the fact that you are not a party? 
  [Carnogursky] We call ourselves a movement, but we are in 
fact a party. We cannot help it if other parties and movements 
have not yet crystallized themselves into any clear, shall we 
say, liberal form. [passage omitted] 
  [Zelenayova] A year ago, you said in reply to my question of 
why the KDH was seeking allies among the representatives of the 
Hungarian minority that you were holding talks with those with 
whom there are the most serious problems. We know, however, 
that, apart from ourselves, virtually no one in Europe admits 
that he has minority problems, although the minorities in 
Slovakia reap the benefit of above-standard rights. Do you not 
think that we ourselves are cultivating the minority problem and 
are doing so by our boundless accommodating attitude toward the 
Hungarian minority's political elite? 
  [Carnogursky] I have already responded to the first part of 
your question--we profess the values of Christianity, nation, 
and Europe. Two of these fundamental values also unite us with 
the Hungarians. These two values, at least, act as a bridge 
between the KDH and Hungarian politicians. Minority problems in 
Europe have led and are leading to tension and even wars. As I 
see the situation in Slovakia, whether on the basis of studying 
history or from my knowledge of the present, Slovakia need not 
fear Hungarian assimilation as long as it manages to preserve 
its political independence. We have the forces to do this. We 
can negotiate with the Hungarians on everything else, and, of 
course, we can also meet them halfway on the principle of 
mutuality, with the status of the Slovak minority in Hungary. 
  [Zelenayova] Or on reciprocity? 
  [Carnogursky] We can also call it that. [passage omitted] 
  [Zelenayova] The Sudeten German issue is important not only 
for the Czech Republic. It is an element of Europe's postwar 
arrangement, and opening it up may trigger a whole avalanche of 
problems. What is your view of this conflict? What do you think 
of it from the point of view of Slovak interests? 
  [Carnogursky] Fortunately, this issue is not a serious 
Slovak problem. The Germans living in Slovakia are called 
Carpathian Germans, and they also have a separate association 
from the Sudeten Germans in Germany. It is also fortunate for 
Slovakia that, after the war, there was no violence against 
Germans on its territory. This happened only during the 
uprising and after the end of the war, when a group of 
Carpathian Germans was returning from Germany to Slovakia and a 
large number of them were murdered at the station in Prerov. 
(SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA has written about this tragedy--Editor.) 
This very much facilitates our current dialogue with the Germans 
and, in general, seeking and maintaining our place in Europe. I 
am digressing a little; for me, this is also proof of how it is 
desirable not to be arrogant toward minorities. In addition, 
the Germans in Slovakia have never formed a strong minority. 
Slovakia should not interfere in the dispute between the Czechs 
and the Sudeten Germans. I think that the Czechs are pursuing 
the wrong policy in that, at the moment, they are trying to 
disengage themselves from their eastern neighbors, from their 
eastern connection--from the Visegrad Four.

<F P=106> [Article by "r": "Chances of Possible Preelection </F>

  [Text] Bratislava--The FOCUS agency conducted a 
representative public opinion survey from 9 to 23 May 1994, in 
which 2,018 respondents were asked: "There is now much talk 
about the formation of preelection coalitions. Will you please 
say whether you would vote for each of the following possible 
coalitions?" 


Coalition                        Yes            No            Do Not Know

  The results of the survey reveal that Slovak citizens are 
ready, to a large degree, to accept possible or already existing 
preelection coalitions of political parties and movements. The 
voters base of each of the possible coalitions monitored is much 
wider than the simple sum of the votes that, according to the 
same survey, would be won by individual parties and movements 
making up the coalition.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by </F>
correspondent Milan Velecky at the Turecky vrch military 
training area near Bratislava on 8 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Velecky] At your press conference, you said 
that Slovakia did not have the financial means even to maintain 
the kind of army allowed by international agreements. Couldn't 
this have a negative impact on the defense capability of our 
state? 
  [Kanis] Naturally, in the prevailing peaceful conditions, 
when there are prerequisites for stability based on peaceful 
coexistence, as well as for stability and security of individual 
countries, the demands on the numbers of servicemen are no 
longer the same as in the previous historical stage. 
  Of course, just like any other army in the neighboring 
states, the Slovak Army has problems arising from the lack of 
financial resources. But even if we cut the numbers of 
servicemen, it will not affect the defense capability of our 
country because our neighbors are doing the same. Moreover, at 
the moment, the whole question is an open one. It is a public 
issue under international control, and therefore our defense is 
also ensured through checks on the effort made in this sphere by 
other states. We do not have to worry, therefore, that 
Slovakia's defense capability will be affected as a result of a 
reduction in the number of servicemen. 
  [Velecky] An amendment to the law on the state budget is 
being prepared, and it has been suggested that some of the 
resources alloted to the Army for this year should be cut. What 
preparations for this variant are you making? 
  [Kanis] It is true that the situation in education and the 
health service, in particular, is so serious that the government 
has to find the necessary financial resources to prevent the 
collapse of these two areas. [passage omitted] 
  Naturally, if my budget is cut, I would endeavor to make up 
for it somehow--for example, by importing spare parts or 
technology instead of repayments from the Russian Federation. A 
contract for $(?90) million has been prepared, and this should 
cover at least some of our needs. 
  At the same time, we have to make the Army more proactive in 
generating income of its own. One has to say quite openly, 
however, that the needs of the Army have not been properly taken 
into account for some years, and, therefore, it is now extremely 
important that next year's budget respect the needs of the 
defense capability of the Slovak Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by </F>
Ivan Stulajter; place and date not given: "One Has To Listen 
Even to Those Who View Things Differently!"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Stulajter] Judging from the 
debate at the recent general assembly of the Union of Industry, 
the greatest resistance to coupon privatization can be expected 
from those circles.... 
  [Janicina] Mr. Borovsky, the new chairman of the Union of 
Industry, sent me a letter in which he insists that each 
privatization project be discussed with his organization. I do 
not know how they got this idea because the Union of Industry 
has no jurisdiction over these matters. In the same letter, Mr. 
Borovsky expressed the view that the ideal share of companies' 
property earmarked for coupon privatization would be 5-10 
percent. Everything suggests that, like Economy Minister Peter 
Magvasi, he would recommend privatization by the management in 
most cases. I am not principally opposed to this, but there 
should be no payment in installments in such cases; the money 
must be put on the table. Even Deputy Prime Minister Brigita 
Schmognerova agrees with me on this point. 
  [Stulajter] Although at first glance this looks like a 
problem of the privatization concept and privatization 
techniques, it cannot be ruled out that, on the hidden plane, it 
is primarily a political problem. 
  [Janicina] This cannot be ruled out. For example, I have 
reservations about the term "tried-and-tested management" 
because what we are talking about are, to a smaller or greater 
degree, communist cadres who are trying to gain economic and, 
subsequently, also political power. On the other hand, there 
should be no generalization. I realize that there are factories 
that will fall on their face if their management leaves. When 
the management is competent and able to pay, it is a contender 
like any other, from my point of view. I do not have the right 
to discriminate against people in privatization only because 
they are members of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] or 
because they were in the communist party in the past, and I am 
not going to discriminate against them. As for the concept of 
privatization, the fact remains that some SDL representatives 
regard coupon privatization as property distribution, which is 
not the task of this government, in their opinion. From my 
viewpoint, coupon privatization is, first and foremost, 
privatization. 
  [Stulajter] The last amendment to the law on large-scale 
privatization increased the powers of your ministry. Under this 
amendment, the ministry can determine the terms, extent, and 
method of privatization. Are you determined to use your powers 
in extreme situations, defying the "resistance" of other 
government departments and various interest lobbies? 
  [Janicina] I intend to use but not abuse those powers. This 
means that whenever different views on some matters arise in the 
government, I will prefer talks to confrontation. One has to 
listen even to those who view things differently.

Slovak korunas [Sk], which is an increase of 16.1 percent over 
the same period last year. The foreign trade balance of the 
Slovak Republic for this period showed a deficit of Sk3.368 
billion. According to an analysis made available to the TA SR 
by the Slovak Statistical Office yesterday, the Slovak 
Republic's exports totalled Sk59.254 billion. They went up 13.8 
percent, compared with the first four months of 1993. The 
Slovak Republic's imports totaled Sk62.622 billion, which means 
an increase of 18.5 percent against the equivalent period a year 
ago. 
  Exports to the Czech Republic accounted for 38 percent of 
the 
Slovak Republic's exports, 17.4 percent of Slovak exports went 
to the FRG, 5.6 percent to Hungary, and 5.2 percent to Austria. 
Other [important] foreign importers of Slovakia's goods were 
Italy, the Russian Federation, Poland, France, Ukraine, the 
United States, and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. As with 
Slovakia's exports, the Czech Republic had the biggest share in 
the Slovak Republic's imports--30.6 percent. It was followed by 
the Russian Federation with 20.6 percent, the FRG with 11.9 
percent, Austria with 5.9 percent, Italy with 3.8 percent, the 
United States with 2.8 percent, France with 2.4 percent, Poland 
with 2.3 percent, and Ukraine with 2 percent.

  [Text] Skopje, June 9 (TANJUG) -- Albania side refused to 
sign Thursday in Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] an inter-state agreement with The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.) on cooperation in the 
areas of agriculture, water resources and forestry, all due to 
misunderstandings over the name of this republic. 
  As set out by Skopje radio Thursday, the Albanian side 
refused to sign the memorandum on cooperation bearing the 
"constitutional name of Macedonia." 
  The radio recalled that only a few days ago, during the 
meeting of the F.Y.R.M. and Albanian presidents -- Kiro Gligorov 
and Sali Berisha -- in Podgradec (Albania) and Ohrid (F.Y.R.M.), 
the name Macedonia was not disputed by either side. 
  An Albanian Government delegation, headed by Agricultural 
Minister Hassan Halili, stayed on a three-day visit to F.Y.R.M. 
  Macedonia was given a temporary name of F.Y.R.M. because of 
a 
dispute with Greece. Greece opposes most strongly the name 
Macedonia as it sees in it territorial pretensions of this state 
towards the northern Greek province of the same name.

<F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "`Evidence' on Gligorov's Desk"] </F>
  [Text] As we have discovered from a number of informal 
discussions in the delegates' group of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal 
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for 
Macedonian National Unity], yesterday a delegation of this 
party, consisting of Ljupco Georgievski, president, Dosta 
Dimovska, vice president, and Boris Zmejkovski, secretary 
general, was received by Kiro Gligorov, president of the 
Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FRYOM] just before the beginning of a new parliamentarian 
session. The same sources claim that the president was 
presented with "documentary evidence" of the state security 
service's involvement in the latest events within this party. 
<H5>  Denial </H5>
  Allegedly, it was a "evidence" to show that the VMRO-DPMNE 
had again been bugged, as well as a "document of the state 
security service" in which some of the delegates of this 
parliamentary group (the factionists) were mentioned under coded 
names. Yesterday, Georgievski, Dimovska, and Zmejkovski were 
hesitant about commenting on the meeting, and we were told to 
wait for the statement expected to be issued by the president's 
office. Nevertheless, we registered that they were not prepared 
to submit this evidence in formal proceedings of the competent 
parliamentary commission for control over the work of the state 
security service, headed by the factionist Stoile Stojkov. 
  Georgievski reiterated his denial of the claim made by 
Stojkov and Stefkovski that he had sent them to Gligorov to 
discuss the flag. We have unofficially found out that such a 
meeting was held with Stefkovski, Stojkov, Jordan Boskov, and 
Tome Stojanovski. However, according to yesterday's version, 
delegate Stojkov came out with his own initiative for replacing 
the 16-pointed star on the flag with the double tailed lion. 
<H5>  Claims </H5>
  Yesterday we also spoke to the other side -- the delegates 
Stojkov and Stefkovski. They both claimed they were still in 
the VMRO-DPMNE and they were also sure that their option would 
win in this party. Stefkovski said that they did not intend to 
attack Georgievski and Dimovska, because they considered they 
were not the actual leaders of the party, in which the alleged 
leaders are Zmejkovski, Dinevski, Sokolov, and Florovski. 
Stefkovski pointed out that in an informal discussion with 
Georgievski they had agreed not to attack each other mutually, 
but the leader broke the agreement in his interview for VECER. 
Besides, Stefkovski claimed that, according to the party 
statute, Georgievski could in no way be elected coordinator of 
the delegates' group, because Article 30 paragraph 2 of the 
Statute says that the leader and the deputy of the delegate 
group are proposed by the president of the party (in this case 
Georgievski proposed himself, the factionists claimed). 
  The general impression of your chronicler is that there is 
total dissatisfaction within the ranks of the VMRO-DPMNE 
delegates' group, but also beyond it, within the opposition 
circles, because of the fact that the affair has acquired such 
dimensions. They are now making rapid attempts to work out how 
to correct what should have been corrected a long time ago, at 
the time the people of this party decided to embark on fierce 
mutual showdowns. 
<H5>  [Box, p 3] </H5>
<H5>  "Clarification of Legal Procedure" </H5>
  Yesterday Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov received the 
leaders of the VMRO-DPMNE at their request, that is, the party 
president, vice president, and general secretary, Ljupco 
Georgievski, Dosta Dimovska, and Boris Zmejkovski. Their 
request for a meeting with President Gligorov was based on the 
explanation that they wanted to inform him about the state 
security service's attitude toward the opposition and that they 
wanted to hand over to him documented evidence. According to 
their claims, it had to do with telephone bugging and operations 
of the state security service involving a number of VMRO-DPMNE 
delegates. 
  At the very beginning President Gligorov emphasized that, 
according to his constitutional and legal authority, he was in 
no position to examine the involvement of the state security 
service in internal party relations. By clearly defined 
constitutional and legal authority, he expressed his firm belief 
that questions of this kind had to be raised and dealt with 
within the framework of the defined legal procedure. In that 
sense, President Gligorov emphasized that, under the 
Constitution, the only competent place to discuss information or 
suspicions about the state security service's attitude toward 
the VMRO-DPMNE was the Macedonian parliamentary commission for 
control over the work of the state security service, and that 
was the appropriate place to discuss documents related to 
initiating proceedings with the competent bodies -- the public 
prosecutor and the appropriate court. That is the only way to 
avoid speculation or rumors surrounding such serious charges. 
It is also the only way to safeguard the basic principles of 
democracy, respect for the law and management of the authorities 
in the republic. 
  President Gligorov also stressed that, in the present 
preelection period, it was especially important to create a 
democratic atmosphere and respect for the law as a permanent 
political orientation in the republic. That will help to 
reinforce the feeling inside and outside the country of respect 
for the basic national interests and the maintenance of the 
integrity of our country, in the face of either internal 
conflicts or foreign pretensions. The VMRO-DPMNE agreed with 
this appeal of the president's.

<F P=106> [Report by E. Sterjevski: "Differentiation on Several </F>
Levels"] 
  [Text] Although it has been 10 days since the unofficial 
promotion of the Macedonian national democratic faction, the 
controversy surrounding the division within the VMRO-DPMNE 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic 
Movement for Macedonian National Unity] is still very much an 
issue. At first there were rumors that the faction was 
supported by a significant number of VMRO-DPMNE delegates, by a 
significant number of members of the Kisela Voda [district in 
Skopje] Communal Committee, and a part of delegates in the 
Skopje Assembly. On the other hand, they now say that the 
actual backing comes from two delegates, Tomislav Stefkovski and 
Stoile Stojkov, and a smaller number of their affiliates who are 
not members of the delegates' group. The causes of the division 
are even more contradictory. While some say personal interests 
and party careers are at stake, others see the "hand of the 
authorities" because the authorities are trying to shake the 
"most national party" exactly during the election period. The 
interesting thing is that, regardless of the causes, the 
VMRO-DPMNE members, even former ones, mutually infer each 
other's cooperation with the state security service. 
  Here is what the leader of the party Ljupco Georgievski, who 
has only recently become coordinator of the VMRO-DPMNE 
delegates' group, said 10 days after the sudden, or expected, 
"shock." 
  "It is obvious that the initial idea of splitting the party, 
which would have bad consequences, was not realized. Although 
the central committee, the communal committees, and the 
delegates' group spoke about the division, it was confined to 
the level of the delegates' group, that is, the level of two 
delegates. There are some who are affiliated with them, but it 
is just a number of delegates from Kisela Voda, and a few from 
the Town Assembly. They are affiliated due to family or 
neighboring relations, as is the case with the wife of Stoile 
Stojkov." 
  [Reporter] What is the essence of the division within the 
party, that is, among the most exposed representatives? 
  [Georgievski] From what I can see, it seems that they are 
ideologically blaming Dosta Dimovska for being a Bulgarian spy, 
Zmejkovski for being Serbian, and me for terrorism. The 
essence, first of all, lies in the struggle for career, for 
personnel changes within the party, which was put as an 
ultimatum to me, too. However, the struggle has not been 
motivated simply by personal ambitions. There are other motives 
as well. This morning I received information that there is 
total chaos within the state security service, that a new 
selection is under way with methods of greatest pressure being 
used. To be more precise, new purges are in progress, as well 
as hearings of all those from [Interior Minister] Frckovski's 
and Bogoeski's department who are suspected of giving 
information to the VMRO-DPMNE. There are mass hearings of 
nearly all the clerks. 
  [Reporter] Speaking about the state security service, we 
should mention the speculation regarding the growing influence 
of foreign services, particularly the Bulgarian secret service. 
There are unofficial rumors that the state security service has 
received information about the greater activities of its 
"colleague" from Bulgaria by using its exponents in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] in the 
"image and work" of some public figures. Rumors are spread 
about the unusual intensification of the activities of the 
movement for cooperation and friendship between the Republic of 
Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria, whose most faithful 
members have been assigned concrete tasks. 
  [Georgievski] It is possible that there is such a reinforced 
activity of the Bulgarian service. Nevertheless it has nothing 
to do with the VMRO-DPMNE. Now we practically do not speak with 
the people from the movement, and this has been the case for a 
couple of years. We are unjustified associated with some things. 
  The practice within the VMRO-DPMNE was to solve internal 
problems leading to division by exclusions. That is how the 
VMRO-DP and VMRO-fatherland were formed. 
  The epilogue to the last events was the replacement of 
Tomislav Stefkovski from the position of coordinator of the 
VMRO-DPMNE delegates' group. "At this moment no other party 
measure has been applied except that Stefkovski was removed from 
the position of coordinator of the delegates' group. 
Nevertheless, we hear they are making attempts to create some 
parallel committees, youth organizations in the communes, 
organize conferences, and so on. That is not possible under the 
VMRO-DPMNE Statute. If that is true, the party will have to 
undertake other measures," Georgievski said. 
  The latter can (but need not) mean that there will be 
further 
developments within the party. In any case, as they say in the 
VMRO-DPMNE leadership, they are waiting for a meeting with 
President Kiro Gligorov to clarify things and explain certain 
documents. If it does not happen in 15 days, the public might 
hear about some new curiosities, this time "black on white."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksandar Soljakovski: "With the Merits of </F>
the Leadership"] 
  [Text] A party has started disintegrating! One may say 
that this is nothing odd for a society in transition, for a 
state in which changes have been moving so fast that, in spite 
of peace and tranquility, changes, traumas, social 
segmentations, political fervor, and disappointments are taking 
place. They are yet to come! 
  The disintegration of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian 
National Unity] today, as an affair, is nothing new. It has 
been the most evident political process going on for three 
years. It has already broken down into several parties with the 
same prefix. The leadership of this party was the only one that 
did not become aware of this process, forecast long ago by 
Macedonian political analysts! Actually, that is the main reason 
for this disintegration. Perhaps it is traumatic for the common 
affiliate, sympathizer, or member of this party. As far as the 
leadership is concerned, as well as those who led it and created 
it (and degraded it), there is simply no justification for lies 
or ignorance. There were (we shall see that later in the text) 
enough signs, indications, and warnings that advertised the 
present situation. Ehether they could not or did not want to, 
the VMRO-DPMNE leadership neither listened to the warnings, nor 
wanted to see what was coming. 
<H5>  "Spying" Affair </H5>
  That is why the thesis putting the blame on the State 
Security Service, which was said to be the main suspect for the 
misfortune of the party that won the majority of seats in the 
Assembly at the first multiparty elections in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] simply cannot be 
true. The plain and obvious reason for this is that if it were 
correct, the logic would be -- if the VMRO-DPMNE had been a 
party that articulated its political doctrine, united and solid, 
there could have been no influences that could affect the 
disintegration of the party, which had such great chances. 
However, chances are one thing, political skill is another. 
  Yes, why is the VMRO-DPMNE actually falling apart? 
  The roots of this misfortune must be searched for in the 
past. They are to be found right at the beginning of the 
formation of this party, in the establishment of its 
foundations, in the establishment of its political practice. 
  Since its formation, suspicions have been created that have 
not been negated so far, nor have there been any attempts to 
clear them up. Information on who created this party remains 
obscure, as well as whose idea and intention it was. The 
ideological founder, Dragan Bogdanovski, is still formally the 
honorable president of the party, and he hinted that he would 
discover the details, however nothing has happened so far. 
  In the euphoria of the election campaign, few people paid 
attention to details, thus many inconsistencies, unproven claims 
and promises, and unjustified attacks and insinuations came from 
this party. Nevertheless, when that political embellishment 
became regular practice, it was clear that this party was full 
of contradictions that could only be removed with a wise, hard, 
and realistic political work. 
  Instead, some recognizable (and predictable) events took 
place in the party. Starting from the elimination of Vladimir 
Golubovski just after the elections, in the style of communist 
showdowns in the struggle for power, to the present purges -- 
the VMRO-DPMNE staff acted on the principles of "supreme" power 
and feverishly sticking to the positions held by the leadership. 
  It is logical that such a party, not open to debate, 
deprived 
of the feeling for ideas and reality, will be left without a 
clear perspective. 
<H5>  Mistake After Mistake </H5>
  At the root of the disintegration of the party that was 
close 
to power (and it alone is to be blamed for not achieving it), 
there were uncounted elements, events, procedures, initiatives, 
and excesses. All of them, together, have played their role in 
today's outcome. 
  It is symptomatic that the VMRO-DPMNE did not succeed in 
taking a decisive, consistent, and politically opportune stance 
on numerous question in the area we refer to as "strategic." It 
is still not clear why the VMRO-DPMNE opposed the referendum on 
independence until the very end, offering instead the far less 
important declaration on independence that had to be adopted by 
the Assembly. The party's delegates were against the adoption of 
the Macedonian Constitution until the last moment; they even 
organized demonstrations in front of the Assembly building, with 
the aim of blocking its adoption. 
  Everything continued in the same style. A range of laws that 
this party had an interest in and proposed were not adopted, and 
it contributed to this, because the manner of the parliamentary 
group became that of an opposition, thus their stances and 
dilemmas lost the crucial significance. 
  In the domain of the "hottest" question -- the dispute with 
Greece -- the parliamentarians of the majority group in the 
Assembly had a negative approach. Their proposals were limited 
to support for a "more aggressive diplomacy" and their full 
contribution was reduced to suspicions that somebody was 
"selling off Macedonia," that somebody was doing something 
devious. Regarding the importance of the admission of the 
Republic of Macedonia to the United Nations, they constantly 
repeated (without effect) that it was achieved in that awkward 
name -- FYROM. We simply did not hear a single inventive 
thought that could support their denial and opposition. 
  It is not known on the basis of what assessments they 
expected the government and the parties that constitute it to 
fall soon so that they may come to power, but it is even less 
explicable that Georgievski left the position of vice president 
of the presidency, thus losing the opportunity of learning 
something and being, more or less, near the sources of 
information that could provide him with more sense in decision 
making when important issues are at stake. It is also unknown 
why this party voted for the fall of [former Prime Minister] 
Kljusev's government in which there were many persons affiliated 
to the VMRO-DPMNE, after which they missed the opportunity of 
forming a government in which they would represent the majority. 
  The present debacle is a result of the numerous staements 
and 
deliberations of the party in which it called for rebellion (on 
2 August 1991), expressing semitruths and lies whenever it 
suited somebody in the party, making statements that power could 
be taken in Macedonia in a democratic way. 
<H5>  Political Semi-People </H5>
  The responsibility for the fall in the party's ratings falls 
on the parliamentarians. Through the low level of their 
discourse and the inarticulate deliberations and excesses, with 
a lower-class vocabulary, the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentarians were 
the leading personalities in debasing the reputation of the 
parliament. The awareness that it is to do with political (and 
moral) semi-people was overwhelming for many of those who 
expected much from pluralism. Whether it was it by intent or 
simply their nature, it will be noted that this party signed and 
insisted on its verdict itself, in the presence of the public. 
  And finally, the suspicions about its affiliation to the 
eastern neighbor were proven by the party itself after its 
recent support for the Movement for Friendship between Bulgaria 
and Macedonia. The same party that was strongly criticizing all 
those who were allegedly affiliated to the northern neighbor is 
now unreservedly acting under influences that are of a very 
suspicious nature. 
  The VMRO-DPMNE is a sad story about the great wish for power 
based on small possibilities, small efforts, and little reason. 
Instead of using victory to define a political line that would 
be compatible with the times and circumstances, the leadership 
of the party involved itself in the schemes and inheritance of a 
classical totalitarian and nationalist party (or movement) that, 
at the moment it had nothing to support -- when the independence 
of Macedonia and its self consciousness came so quickly and in a 
relatively painless way -- did not find the strength to modify 
its policy. The election victory, won as a lottery, was wasted 
the way a poor person spends money that is easily earned. 
  That is why looking for the reasons for the disintegration 
is 
nothing but a bad excuse, a befogging and covering up of the 
real guilt for the debacle. Fortunately, but it is also a great 
disappointment, the members and sympathizers of this party know 
perfectly well where the problem lies. We believe they 
discovered it a long time ago.

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by Emil Sterjevski: "Is There a </F>
Division in the Leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE?"] 
<H5>  [27 May p 4] </H5>
  [Text] 
<H5>  Democratic Faction in a Democratic Party </H5>
  A development which has recently been mentioned and become a 
topic for speculation publicly is that something serious is 
happening within the ranks of the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal 
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization -- Democratic Party for 
Macedonian National Unity] and this change is now appearing 
clearly. Although it has not been officially disclosed, it is 
certain that a so-called Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] National Democratic Faction has 
proclaimed itself within the party. As we have learned, this 
faction includes a large number of parliamentary representatives 
of the VMRO-DPMNE and is a counterbalance to the party's core 
leadership (it is said that there are more than 10 
representatives attached to the faction). In this faction of the 
VMRO-DPMNE are representatives Stoile Stojkov, Tomislav 
Stojanovski, and the coordinator of the party group Tomislav 
Stefkovski. 
  The day before yesterday, before the announced beginning of 
the parliamentary session, a special party meeting was held 
during which some positions emerged which, for unknown reasons, 
were not revealed publicly in the announcement. The faction 
explained the reasons for its declaration primarily as a 
reaction to the ideological, national, and organizational 
failures of part of the party's core leadership in the 
VMRO-DPMNE. 
  Representative Stoile Stojkov allegedly at one point in the 
Assembly openly announced the formation of the Macedonian 
National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE. Although the 
disunity in positions could be "read" in the attacks from the 
assembly podium, he explained some of the reasons for this step. 
It was brought to the attention of the core leadership of the 
VMRO-DPMNE, for example, "the closing of the party to the 
acceptance of new members, especially those with higher 
education." Similarly, the following reasons for the 
(un)revealed existence of the faction were cited: "the 
characterization of the party as terrorist," the behavior and 
statements of certain members, as well as those of the 
VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary by-election candidate in the electoral 
district 103 in the Skopje-area Kisela Voda opstina, Branislav 
Sinadinovski, and the simultaneous support of these comments in 
the name of the VMRO-DPMNE by the general secretary of the 
party, Boris Zmejkovski. We found out first-hand that the 
representatives and [local government] councillors of the 
Macedonian National Democratic Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE 
"remaining faithful to their constituents and sympathizers, will 
continue their political commitment to the well-being of the 
Macedonian state and the Macedonian nation." Stoile Stojkov 
believes that "We have serious observations concerning the 
privatization of the party. That a mass party like the 
VMRO-DPMNE should allow privatization by certain leading members 
is completely undemocratic." 
  Among those better acquainted with conditions in "the most 
Macedonian party," this development is not unexpected. What is 
interesting is the manner in which the disagreement over the 
policy of the party's core leadership is expressed, that is, in 
the formation of a faction within the party and not a secession 
from it. Anyhow, factions do exist in parties and probably will 
continue to exist, but it is another thing whether they are 
revealed or not. Nevertheless, the (non)declaration of the 
Macedonian National Democratic Faction in the VMRO-DPMNE, which 
is now a fact, became more visible a few days ago when the 
VMRO-DPMNE Opstina Committee (OK) in Kisela Voda issued a public 
communique. In it, the committee broke its silence about some 
"methods" of activity in the party. The chairman of the OK 
reacted to "the despotic act committed by VMRO-DPMNE General 
Secretary Boris Zmejkovski, which has been documented in one of 
the OK publications in Kisela Voda; this is an act, according to 
the OK, which is typical only of totalitarian parties." The 
committee strongly protested to the VMRO-DPMNE leadership and 
asked (in writing, according to the communique) Zmejkovski to 
explain to the Macedonian public "why he employed such 
antidemocratic methods and why he found party policies like 
those of Aleksandar Dinevski and Ivan Sokolov necessary." The 
VMRO-DPMNE OK chairman in Kisela Voda characterized that same 
act as personal retaliation and a demand for an alibi for the 
unsuccessful by-election in the 103d district, saying "with his 
pledge to distinguish himself, the unsuitable candidate 
Branislav Sinadinovski brought the VMRO-DPMNE the slander of 
terrorism." 
  It is not accidental that this public disclosure from the 
VMRO-DPMNE OK in Kisela Voda has appeared at the same time as 
the declaration of the Macedonian National Democratic Faction; 
behind this faction there are a large number of representatives 
and, as we have learned unofficially, a large number of 
councillors. Namely, in the first multiparty election, Kisela 
Voda was the largest trump card for the VMRO-DPMNE. From this 
area came a solid number of representatives. We should recall 
that it was thanks to the voters in this Skopje-area opstina 
that Boris Zmejkovski, Kole Lulovski, Ratka Dimitrova, Tomislav 
Stefkovski, Nikola Krstevski, and Dosta Dimovska arrived on the 
political scene. 
  In any case, if there is discord in the attitudes of party 
members--we are not speaking of just the representatives--then 
that fact would better highlight the declaration of this 
faction. The analyst can expand this trend to include the 
opstina committees in Titov Veles, Bitola, Ohrid, and even now 
in Kisela Voda. It is not possible to forget the divided party 
positions about the visit of the party's core leadership to 
Bulgaria, and especially, the (un)expected presence of Deputy 
Chairman Dosta Dimovska at the recent support rally in Skopje of 
the Movement for Cooperation and Friendship between the Republic 
of Macedonia and the Republic of Bulgaria.

<H5>  Farce About Alleged Espionage </H5>
  The formal (non)declaration of the so-called "Macedonian 
National Democratic Faction" in the VMRO-DPMNE was no surprise 
for those who are better informed about this party, a party that 
has the most representatives in parliament. Just the fact that 
one can now speak of any kind of faction within a party is a 
surprise in itself. Perhaps for the public, the fact that is 
surprising is that in the faction there is a large number of 
representatives, among whom there are people who, until 
yesterday, were considered to be "the most ingrained VMRO 
types." The reason for such a division within the party, 
according to the faction, lies in the "dissatisfaction with the 
ideological, national, and organizational scrambling by the core 
leadership of the VMRO-DPMNE." Let us be more concrete: It is a 
question of a disagreement with Chairman Ljupco Georgievski, 
Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska, General Secretary Boris 
Zmejkovski, and some others among them, like Dragi Arsov or 
Branislav Sinadinovski, for example. 
  According to Stoile Stojkov, "A mass party like the 
VMRO-DPMNE permits itself to be privatized by individual leading 
members. This is not democratic. Moreover, practically from the 
convening of parliament, there have been disagreements and 
differences--and what are they, if not factions? This process 
began already at the time when Vladimir Golubovski left the 
party and has continued through the settling of accounts in the 
opstina committees." 
  And, in fact, much has happened in the ranks of this 
numerically strong party. From its ranks emerged first the 
VMRO-DP [VMRO-Democratic Party], then the VMRO-Fatherland, and 
the VMRO-United. The formation of these parties became necessary 
because of divisions or secessions over some party policy of the 
VMRO-DPMNE. And not just that. Some attacks made from the 
assembly podium by representatives of this party show that 
something serious is happening within this party. The 
culmination probably was the contradictory explanations 
following the election in the 103d Skopje-area district, which, 
in effect, divided opinion about the kinds of methods the 
VMRO-DPMNE would employ to gain power. The latest case is the 
visit of the core leadership to the Republic of Bulgaria just at 
the time when the second round of voting in the 103d district 
was taking place, and the promotion of the movement for 
Macedonian-Bulgarian friendship and cooperation, at which, 
according to some party members, Deputy Chairman Dosta Dimovska 
was suspiciously in attendance. From this, one could hear more 
audibly talk of some pro-Bulgarian option. 
  What is perhaps more essential is whether the division in 
the party leads to reciprocal accusations and suspicions: Which 
is the pro-Bulgarian orientation, which the pro-Serbian, who is 
the infiltrator from state security, and so forth. In this 
context, the departure of Ratka Dimitrova from the coordinating 
function and her particular distancing from the party is an 
example. All these coincidences, especially the declaration of 
the faction, are open to many "interpretations" about what is 
going on within the party. Thus, Stoile Stojkov, who also serves 
as chairman of the parliamentary Commission for Control over the 
State Security Service, has been called a spy by some people in 
the VMRO-DPMNE leadership, while Tomislav Stefkovski is 
allegedly an infiltrator from the party with "special tasks." 
Stoile Stojkov says categorically: "Such a farce about alleged 
espionage is not only untrue, but also counterproductive. 
Besides, this is no new tactic; such tactics were used at the 
time against Vladimir Golubovski and Ratka Dimitrova." 
  This, however, is not everything that can be heard within 
the 
party. For some people, that measure (the faction's declaration) 
is, in fact, the first step toward movement into the Democratic 
Party (DP). In the DP, however, this is roundly denied, and it 
is said that such an allegation is a banana peel intended for 
the VMRO-DPMNE by state security. Those, again, who have had 
somewhat different perspectives maintain that it is precisely 
that faction and its members, now said to number 11 and to 
include members of the parliamentary staff, who are really 
closer to the so-called Macedonian left, as can be seen in their 
attacks in the assembly. On the other hand, the motive is 
distancing from the stubborn attitudes and the phobia of the 
leadership headed by Ljupco Georgievski and General Secretary 
Boris Zmejkovski with respect to the government and, especially, 
toward the president of the country. 
  According to Stoile Stojkov, "The latest version of my visit 
and of the consultations of Tomislav Stefkovski with President 
Kiro Gligorov is already in the making. General Secretary Boris 
Zmejkovski maintains that there is an audio tape of the meeting 
the two of us had with Gligorov. If that were true, I would ask 
him to release the tape publicly, so it can be known what we 
talked about at that meeting. And if there were anything to it, 
then the question arises whether someone is controlling the 
chief of state, or, on the other hand, whether Zmejkovski is so 
skillful and installed the listening devices." 
  Stojkov's faction has reproached the core leadership for its 
privatization of the party, exclusiveness, and the lack of 
respect for the opinions of others. Another VMRO-DPMNE 
representative, Kole Lulovski, is likewise estranged from the 
party. "I have always been on the second flank for the party, 
and now I am on the third. We should recall that my positions 
are individual; I do not participate in the caucuses of the core 
leadership, and I am absolutely even more aloof from these 
revelations. The formation of the faction is new to me--`a 
special firm' in the VMRO-DPMNE." In any case, he continues, "It 
would be good to clean up the situation before the elections." 
  Obviously, the VMRO-DPMNE has some calculating techniques. 
Meanwhile, another matter comes to mind. The practice in this 
party has been that whenever it is understood that there is 
dissent from the leadership, those espousing such views are 
simply excluded from the party. Whether that was done with the 
aim of acquiring the impression that there were no people within 
the party with dissenting views is another story. In any case, 
the outcomes in the VMRO-DPMNE opstina committees in Bitola, 
Titov Veles, and Ohrid are in themselves indicative. Out of 
them, a new party (VMRO-Fatherland) has emerged, and the local 
leadership in Ohrid, along with the party youth group there, 
went over to the competition (at least from Ohrid's point of 
view), that is, the VMRO-DP. Whether this time there will be a 
deviation from that practice will be a difficult question to 
answer, although it is known that things are not harmonious. 
Perhaps the key lies in the distribution of members, who, in any 
case, have led the VMRO-DPMNE parliamentary group, more 
precisely in the existence of the Macedonian National Democratic 
Faction of the VMRO-DPMNE, to act as a serious counterbalance 
within the party ranks. 
  For those who want to make forecasts, a nerve-racking party 
resolution is soon to be settled. But, no one knows how at this 
time.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- The United States 
continues flirting with the Bosnian Muslims, so that Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro), which is in no way involved in the civil 
war in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, has 
to bear the brunt of it, diplomatic and political circles in 
Belgrade say on Friday. 
  This assessment is based on the latest threats by top U.S. 
officials that if the Bosnian Muslims reject the peace plan, 
they would be punished by a gradual lifting of sanctions against 
Yugoslavia and, if the Bosnian Serbs fail to accept the plan, 
the Bosnian Muslims would in return be exempt from the U.N. arms 
embargo (in force for all of the former Yugoslavia) and the 
anti-Yugoslav sanctions tightened. 
  The United States has for the first time officially admitted 
that the anti-Yugoslav sanctions were entirely politically 
motivated rather than caused by Yugoslavia's alleged aggression 
against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the circles say. 
  The sanctions aimed to force Yugoslavia to pressure the 
Bosnian Serbs to renounce their right to self-determination, 
create a chaos in Serbia and effect a change of authorities 
there. 
  After these two intentions had failed, the U.S. engineered a 
new one -- to make the lifting of the sanctions conditional on 
the peace in Bosnia. 
  Thus, the U.S. simultaneously threatened to punish either 
the 
Bosnian Serbs or Muslims. Belgrade says the parallel threats 
aim to justify a decision of the House of Representatives to 
unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Muslims from the U.N. arms sales 
embargo. 
  Belgrade describes the decision, which is still to be 
confirmed by the Senate and can be vetoed by U.S. President Bill 
Clinton, as political calculations which are hardly applicable 
in practice, because a final decision to exempt the Muslims from 
the embargo would simultaneously give others the right to 
unilaterally lift the anti-Yugoslav sanctions. 
  The U.S. is fully aware of this, but its obvious intention 
is 
to pressure the Bosnian Serbs into accepting the peace plan. It 
has already estimated that the Serbs are very likely to reject 
the peace plan, whose concept is much closer to what the Bosnian 
Muslim government regards as a reasonable solution. 
  U.S. officials say that in the next six weeks America and 
its 
NATO allies will come out with a plan, which incorporates also a 
map of territorial delineation between the Bosnian Muslim-Croat 
federation and the Serbs. 
  Belgrade believes that the maps will be drawn up to the 
benefit of the Bosnian Muslims and to the Bosnian Serbs' 
detriment. The Serbs are thus bound to reject it, which would 
supply an excuse for the sanctions to be prolonged. 
  If the United States and its closest allies actually wish to 
bring the Bosnian war to an end and to find a political solution 
acceptable to all, the first step is definitely the lifting of 
the sanctions against Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign </F>
affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, by Julius 
Loerincz in Belgrade; date not given: "The War Has Reopened Old 
Wounds and Opened New Ones"] 
  [Text] Originally, 40 minutes were reserved for my 
meeting with Vladislav Jovanovic, minister of foreign affairs of 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. But both of us were so 
absorbed in conversation that it took 25 minutes longer than 
scheduled. While the interview we publish is fairly extensive, 
it actually represents only a fraction of the comprehensive 
debate with this experienced 61-year-old member of the 
government, who has been active in diplomacy and in the foreign 
service since 1957. 
  [Loerincz] It is being said that the key to solving the 
crisis in the Yugoslav space lies in Serb-Croat relations. Does 
the opening of a Yugoslav representative office in Zagreb and of 
a Croatian representative office in Belgrade herald the coming 
of better days? Or are those who believe that overly optimistic 
because far more serious problems in these relations are waiting 
for a solution? 
  [Jovanovic] It is the first step toward the normalization of 
relations. As far as we are concerned, we are interested in 
this process [of normalization] taking place as fast as 
possible. We are prepared even now to recognize Croatia in the 
borders that it controls, on the understanding that the question 
of the Serbian Krajina would be put aside for the time being, 
until Zagreb and Knin (main center of the republic Serbian 
Krajina -- editor's note) find in mutual negotiations a final 
political solution to their relations. This is in keeping with 
the plan of Cyrus Vance, which emphasizes its own temporary 
nature and does not prejudice any future political solution. 
Theoretically, this does not rule out the possibility of the 
expansion of the recognition of Croatia from the viewpoint of 
borders in the future. Croatia evidently approaches the 
question of normalization of relations with us differently and 
understands it as a means toward its recognition in its former 
borders as established by the Antifascist Council of National 
Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ, that is, the borders as they 
emerged from the national liberation struggle during World War 
II). However, for us this would mean defiance of the will of the 
population of Serbian Krajina. Only they are entitled to decide 
on their future, not we. For the time being, however, we could 
develop mutually advantageous relations in other areas, without 
allowing the disputed Krajina issue to complicate them. 
  [Loerincz] But at least two partners are needed for such 
relations to be developed.... 
  [Jovanovic] It seems that Croatia is not prepared for this, 
as it is trying right from the beginning to politicize the 
process of normalization of relations with the Krajina. The 
final political solution must be achieved in the third and final 
phase of the whole process. Precisely because this phase will 
be the most important and the most sensitive one, it must be 
preceded by phase one and phase two: an end to hostility and 
normalization of economic relations. These two phases must 
establish good conditions for the successful start and, I hope, 
also a successful conclusion of the aforementioned third phase. 
  [Loernicz] Some analysts believe that the issue of Kosovo in 
the south of Serbia, which is inhabited largely by Albanians, 
could be tackled in some analogous way. In other words, if 
Serbian Krajina seceded from Croatia, would Kosovo also secede 
from Serbia? 
  [Jovanovic] Kosovo should not be mixed up with the elements 
of the Yugoslav crisis because it is not a constituent element 
of this crisis. It is a typical example of the separatism of 
one ethnic minority and this problem arose many years before the 
Yugoslav crisis even broke out. In the Yugoslav crisis one has 
to address the problems bequeathed by the breaking away of four 
republics (Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina). Krajina is one of these problems -- it 
arose as a result of the one-sided breaking away of Croatia from 
Yugoslavia and of the denial of the Serbs' constitutional rights 
in Croatia. 
  [Loerincz] In your opinion, the problems of Kosovo should 
thus be dealt with exclusively as an internal Yugoslav issue, so 
to speak? 
  [Jovanovic] Kosovo has always been an organic part of 
Serbia, it is actually the cradle of Serbian statehood, church, 
and literature. It has never been part of any Albanian state. 
Therefore, there does not exist any historical or moral reason 
to consider Kosovo's secession and possible annexation to 
Albania. Also, there is no method of carrying this out, except 
by declaring war on the whole Serbian nation.... 
  We respect our Albanian fellow citizens and apply toward 
them 
the same equal attitude as in relation to all citizens of 
Yugoslavia. The Serbian Constitution is based on the civic 
principle and defines Serbia as a state of equal nations, not as 
the state of the Serbian nation. When our Albanians rid 
themselves of the spell of separatism and start exercising the 
rights they have, they can, within 24 hours, become active in 
democratic institutions and realize their rights through them. 
  [Loerincz] You mentioned that the Constitution defines 
Serbia as a state of citizens, which is surely positive. 
However, the more than 60,000 Slovaks in Vojvodina, for 
example, who had settled there 250 years ago and who made their 
contribution to the creation of Yugoslavia, are being confronted 
with acts of extremists who tell them: "Go back where you came 
from." 
  [Jovanovic] What you are saying is the work of extremist 
right-wing and nationalist groups. These things used to happen, 
in particular, at the time when the Yugoslav crisis broke out 
and when the war in the Krajina and in Bosnia had exceptionally 
dramatic dimensions. Many frustrated and embittered refugees 
came to Serbia, among whom feelings of revenge and retribution 
became manifest. They received support also from individuals and 
groups in Serbia but this was marginal and ran counter to our 
policy. 
  The threats you mention, which were addressed not only to 
Slovaks but also to Hungarians, are absolutely inadmissible and 
we have taken steps against them. But they need not be 
generalized. We regard Slovaks as loyal and hard-working people 
who mean much for the cultural wealth of our community. 
  [Loerincz] Do you think that the proposal for the partition 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, under which the Muslim-Croat federation 
is to receive 51 percent and Bosnian Serbs 49 percent [of 
territory], is a good and just solution? Is the coexistence of 
Serbs, Muslims, and Croats even still possible? 
  [Jovanovic] You know, the Serbs, Muslims, and Croats come 
essentially from one nation and speak the same language. We are 
people of the same blood and have the same merits and the same 
weaknesses. Unfortunately, the virus of nationalism incited 
from abroad managed to destroy coexistence in 
Bosnia-Hercegovina. The fratricidal war has brought new 
divisions, reopened wounds from the last, far more drastic war, 
and opened new wounds. Much effort will therefore be needed 
both in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself and from us beyond its borders 
in order to create foundations for the renewal of coexistence. 
We will always remain brothers regardless of past and present 
fighting there, regardless of how much hatred there is. I 
believe that foreign interests have caused much evil and are the 
main reason for there still being no peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Forces from outside Europe, in particular, 
want this continent to be weakened by the prolongation of the 
crisis and the continuation of sanctions. Let us not forget 
that while the Serbs in Bosnia supported the plan of the 
European Union, this plan was rejected by the Muslim side, after 
it received signals from the Americans, Turkey, and other 
Islamic countries. 
  [Loerincz] The leading representative of Bosnian Muslims, 
Alija Izetbegovic, has repeatedly called for the preservation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a multinational and multicultural state. 
  [Jovanovic] Mr. Izetbegovic is a well-known Islamic 
fundamentalist. In December 1991, still before the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, he declared on television that he was ready 
to sacrifice peace for the sake of Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
independence. Politicians who say things like that are usually 
taken to a psychiatric ward. But the world did not react at 
that time. Izetbegovic has now again said something scandalous. 
Supposedly, the Serbs can never kill as many Muslims as Muslim 
mothers and fathers will beget. This is typical fundamentalist 
thinking and reminds me of Khomeyni, who used to send children 
into war in the awareness that they would perish. 
  [Loerincz] What then is the way out of this war? Could a 
solution lie in the aforementioned partition of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a ratio of 51 to 49? 
  [Jovanovic] It is not the best solution in all its parts but 
the Bosnian Serbs have accepted it and I would like to draw 
attention to the fact that at one time, at the talks on the 
Invincible aircraft carrier in the Adriatic, it had also been 
accepted by the Muslims and Croats, Yugoslavia, and the European 
Union. Personally, I do not think that percentages are the most 
important thing but, rather, the readiness and goodwill to 
achieve a reasonable compromise. The Bosnian Serbs have been 
prepared for it for two years, ever since they offered territory 
for peace sometime in June or July 1992, which they confirmed in 
written form to Lord Carrington. The offer, which concerned the 
exchange of 20 percent of the territory under their control for 
peace, is still valid today. 
  [Loerincz] Extensive sanctions against Yugoslavia have been 
applied for two years now. One of the arguments for their 
introduction and tightening was that Yugoslavia had its troops 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This turned out not to be true, however. 
What then is the aim of the sanctions? 
  [Jovanovic] Germany and the then European Community 
introduced the sanctions eight months before the war in Bosnia 
with the aim of forcing the rest of Yugoslavia to dissolve 
itself. All parts of Yugoslavia were to accept this, establish 
new states, and request international recognition. This part 
(Serbia and Montenegro), which represents one-half of former 
Yugoslavia, did not agree to that. It said: "You cannot deprive 
us of our homeland. This is our state. True, it has been 
reduced in size by the others' departure, but it is still our 
state." It is for this reason that we were punished by 
sanctions. We made ourselves guilty by refusing to renounce our 
own country, by not being willing to disintegrate, which was 
needed, in particular, by Germany. 
  [Loerincz] After Germany's unification? 
  [Jovanovic] Yes. It quickly started to carry out its 
political and economic expansion, particularly in those 
directions, in which it previously tried to expand by military 
means. It forced its position on the then European Community. 
New sanctions, or their expansion and tightening, were then 
justified by the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which we 
are supposedly responsible. Yet it is the coalition of Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats that bears responsibility for the civil war 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was this coalition that violated the 
constitution of this republic in the parliament of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and deprived the Serbs of the right to 
constitutionality [ustavotvornost] and the right to consensus. 
The referendum that took place on the issue of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's independence was based on the majority 
principle, which runs counter to the principle of consensus. 
This meant the trampling underfoot of the Constitution and of 
the Serbs' rights. Western countries then very quickly 
recognized the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, although the 
declaration of independence did not have the support of 
one-third of the population. That led to civil war, for which 
it was necessary to find a scapegoat. 
  [Loerincz] Are you suggesting that the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia has become this scapegoat? 
  [Jovanovic] Exactly, although it was precisely Yugoslavia 
that accepted all the four major peace plans for a solution to 
the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Serbs have 
accepted three of them, rejecting only the Vance-Owen plan for 
the cantonization of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Izetbegovic has 
accepted only one of them, precisely the one that was rejected 
by the Bosnian Serbs. He apparently did so for tactical reasons. 
  Croatia had its regular troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which 
were involved in fighting there. But no one called Croatia to 
account and no one punished it because of this. This is a case 
of double standards, which are practiced also by Turkey, which 
finances, arms, and incites Bosnian Muslims, or Iran, which 
violates the embargo on supplies of weapons to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  [Loerincz] Is a certain one-sidedness on the part of some 
media, which sees all evil on the Serbian side, not part of the 
policy of sanctions? 
  [Jovanovic] The media blockade against the Serbian nation 
had been organized even before the Yugoslav crisis broke out, by 
separatists and their foreign helpers, who at that time came 
mostly from the German-speaking bloc and from the Vatican. They 
systematically created an inaccurate and extremely biased image 
of Yugoslavia where, supposedly, democracy is possible only when 
support is given to the breaking away of some republics. 
According to this image, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serbian 
nation are by their very nature negative, conservative, 
demagogic, narrow-minded in their ideology, and seeking hegemony 
over others. Sympathy for Slovenia and Croatia and antipathy 
for Serbs were being built on this [image]. We underestimated 
this because we believed that Yugoslavia would exist forever. 
Following these preparations, the separatists went on the 
offensive against Yugoslavia at a time when the cold war ended 
and the Soviet Union fell apart. It was a "blitzkrieg," in 
which they broke up one country. 
  [Loerincz] Relations between our states and between Slovaks 
and Serbs, Montenegrins, and the other Yugoslav nations have a 
long tradition. They were close and multifaceted already in the 
19th century. How do you view the present and prospects of 
relations between Slovakia and Yugoslavia? 
  [Jovanovic] This traditional friendship, forged frequently 
in critical moments of history, lives in our memories and 
hearts. I am thinking here of both the Czech and the Slovak 
people. In 1938 my brother, like many others, volunteered to go 
and defend then Czechoslovakia. 
  Slovakia is perhaps even closer to us, which is surely true 
geographically and linguistically. We have similar geostrategic 
experience. We are Danube nations and have many reasons to 
develop friendship and cooperation. That is why, immediately 
after the declaration of Slovakia's independence, we proposed 
opening an embassy in your country -- your embassy in Belgrade 
operates already. However, we have not yet received your 
government's agreement. It would be in the interest of our 
nations and of peace and stability in this part of Europe. It 
would also be in the interest of greater mutual understanding, 
for there is not enough of this after everything that has 
happened in our region.

  [Text] While Milosevic is still demanding a state for the 
Serbs in Croatia, he does not even want to know about Croats in 
Serbia. This is corroborated by news from Sombor [northern 
Vojvodina province] where a debate was held yesterday evening on 
the subject of the position and rights of national minorities in 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]. Also attending was FRY 
Human and Minority Rights Minister Margit Savovic. 
  Asked by Mate Mataric, president of the Sombor branch of the 
Democratic Alliance of Vojvodina Croats [DSHV], about the status 
of Croats in Yugoslavia, she replied that Croats cannot even be 
a national minority in the Serbian-Montenegrin state. According 
to her, this is because the FRY does not recognize Croatia; and 
as international law prescribes that the national minority 
status can only be accorded to peoples with a parent country, 
Croats in the FRY cannot even be a national minority. 
  Commenting on the existence of a threat to the Croats in 
Vojvodina, she said that this is not the case and that all 
Croats who moved from Yugoslavia did so voluntarily. We would 
like to add that more than 35,000 Croats were expelled over the 
past three years from Vojvodina alone, and that the ethnic 
cleansing of Srem, Banat, and Backa [areas in Vojvodina] 
continues.

  [Text] Sofia, June 9 (BTA) -- "The people in the Balkans 
have no alternative but living together in some sort of 
community, at first an economic community, and later on, 
possibly in a Balkan state," Prof. Dr. Mira Markovic, wife of 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, told a news conference 
today. Dr. Markovic arrived in Sofia yesterday on the 
invitation of the Bulgarian Slavyani Fund. Today she took part 
in the presentation of her book "Odgovor," [Reply] published 
last year in Belgrade, which was organized at the independent 
Balkan news agency. The event was attended by Yugoslavia's 
Charge d'Affaires in Sofia Rados Smilkovic, Russia's Ambassador 
in Sofia Aleksandr Avdeyev, the leader of the Bulgarian Business 
Bloc George Ganchev, the leader of the Women's Democratic Union 
Emiliya Maslarova, Bulgarian scientists, actors and journalists. 
  Dr. Markovic said that the integration of the Balkan nations 
is a prerequisite for the integration of Europe. Asked which 
Balkan countries she believed would join a future Balkan state 
and which city would be its capital, Mrs. Markovic said that all 
Balkan countries are equally capable of living in one community. 
In connection with a recent publication in THE WASHINGTON POST 
about the Balkans, Mrs. Markovic said the fate of the Balkan 
nations should be determined by themselves and not by the United 
States. 
  Asked why Yugoslavia has not yet recognized the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] yet, Mrs. 
Markovic said that she is in Sofia in her capacity as a cultural 
and public figure and not as wife of President Slobodan 
Milosevic, leaving it to Mr. Smilkovic to give an official 
answer to this question. Mr. Smilkovic explained that the 
former Yugoslav republics agreed to meet certain conditions 
before leaving the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia but 
not all commitments have been honoured. That was the reason why 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not made a statement on 
the recognition of Macedonia. "Former Yugoslavia was the first 
to recognize the Macedonian nation," Mr. Smilkovic recalled. 
  Asked if she expects support from the Bulgarian left-wing 
parties for lifting the Yugoembargo, Mrs. Markovic said: "Yes, 
we expect support from the Bulgarian left wing, but also from 
the Bulgarian right wing, as they are the ones who have more say 
here." 
  Dr. Markovic met with her colleagues from the Bulgarian 
Association of Sociologists last night. Tomorrow she is 
expected to have meetings in the Bulgarian Parliament and with 
Culture Minister Ivaylo Znepolski, said Slavyani Fund Chief 
Zakhari Zakhariev. Mrs. Markovic gave a long interview on 
Bulgarian National Radio in the early afternoon today.

  [Text] Zagreb ROMPRES, 6/6/1994 -- The Romanian-Croatian 
relations can be "special," Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae 
Vacaroiu said at the first round of official talks with his 
Croatian counterpart, Nikica Valentic, because there are no 
divergent opinions between the sides. We have complementary 
industries, which can cooperate for third market projects, the 
Romanian premier said. 
  The talks revealed the interest of the present Romanian 
executive in boosting the economic relations with Croatia. He 
suggested, for the purpose, the establishment of joint ventures, 
an idea received with interest by the Croatian side. 
  Premier Valentic showed that the road and rail links between 
his country and Romania were extremely important and requested 
that "Romania uses its influence" to have them channeled through 
Serbia. 
  Although no reference was made to the conflict in the former 
Yugoslav space, the idea of a peaceful settlement of it underlay 
the top level Romanian-Croatian meeting, the resumption of 
normal economic relations being a sign that the situation in the 
zone is stabilizing. 
  In the afternoon Premier Nicolae Vacaroiu had meetings with 
the speaker of the Croatian Parliament, Nedjeljko Mihanovic, and 
the mayor of Zagreb, Branko Miksa.

those younger experts and politicians who have only recently 
become known in the MSZP will also be considered in the course

  [Text] During the weekly news conference of the Civic 
Alliance Party [PAC] today, Party Chairman Nicolae Manolescu 
read out a declaration that describes the principles proposed by 
the steering collegium of the party to reorganize the Democratic 
Convention of Romania [CDR] so that it could become a 
competitive part of the Romanian political class. 
  In that sense, the following things are suggested: the 
transformation of the CDR into a strong alliance of political 
parties able to make political and postelectoral offers on the 
basis of a joint political platform; the separation of non-party 
associations and their transformation into a civil forum 
supporting the CDR by undertaking specific actions; the 
structuring of the CDR into central political leading bodies, 
working bodies, and local bodies; the making of decisions within 
the CDR solely on the basis of consensus; the working out of a 
protocol on the ways to participate in elections; the working 
out of terms regarding postelectoral cooperation; and the 
establishing of ethical rules referring to interparty relations 
within the CDR. 
  The declaration also states that the sole way to solve 
certain tensions that have emerged among the democratic 
opposition is to sincerely and responsibly approach the ways in 
which the CDR could be reorganized, reports our correspondent, 
Iulia Gherman.

  [Text] [Announcer] Political parties and other Albanian 
organizations in the Republic of Kosova continue to react to the 
so-called secret Albanian-Serb talks in Belgrade held by some 
unauthorized individuals who do not enjoy the mandate of the 
Albanian people of Kosova. For more details, Mehmet Haziri 
reports from Prishtina: 
  [Haziri] At a news conference held by the Social Democratic 
Party of Kosova, its chairman, academician Besim Vokshi, 
declared before correspondents that, under these circumstances, 
it is very natural that secret or somewhat secret talks with two 
or three intellectuals of ours with the Serbian side can arouse 
curiousness, as well dissatisfaction and immediate revolt. 
  No one can represent the Albanian people if they do not have 
the legitimacy of the people. The selection for talks of these 
intellectuals by the Serbs is carried out due to the similar 
option they have regarding the solution of the status of Kosova, 
contrary to the referendum of the Albanian people, Besim Vokshi 
stressed. 
  He said that the Social Democratic Party of Kosova condemns 
the new wave of violence and imprisonments of the 
representatives of the legal institutions in Kosova, by 
assessing these actions as Serbia's attempts to stop the 
activity of the Albanian political parties and oblige Albanians 
to accept Serbia's option on the solution of the Kosova issue. 
  Through a press communique, the National Unity Party 
condemns 
the lunches and dinners, as it is said, with the enemies of the 
Albanian nation. After criticizing the anti-Albanian backstage 
of Belgrade and the architects of the anti-Albanian projects, 
the communique condemns the presentation of several junior 
vassals who are or have emerged from the Albanian political 
parties and who have no mandates and speak about restructuring 
the future of Kosova. 
  Albanian-Serb dialogue can be carried out only by those who 
have the legitimacy of the Albanian people in the Republic of 
Kosova, the press communique of the National Unity Party states. 
  Meanwhile, the Coordinating Council of the Albanian 
Christian 
Democratic Party considers that Albanian-Serb dialogue can begin 
only in the presence of an international body and legitimate 
representatives of the Albanian people can participate in it, 
i.e., President Ibrahim Rugova and his co-workers, who are 
appointed by him only, but not the non-legitimate persons. 
  The Coordinating Council of the Albanian Christian 
Democratic 
Party examined other issues of interest for institutionalizing 
life in Kosova.

  [Text] [Announcer] Our colleague Arijana Saracevic was on 
duty today in the building of the Presidency and she monitored 
the information that came in. We have her on the line and she 
says she has some important information. Good evening, 
colleague Saracevic: 
  [Saracevic] Good evening, colleague Selimovic. As you have 
already said, I am reporting from the building of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency and from the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government session, and I have a piece of truly (?incredible) 
information to tell you. Namely, the U.S. Congress has passed 
the McCloskey Amendment regarding the lifting of the arms 
embargo. It is interesting to note that 245 congressmen voted 
in favor of the amendment, while 175 voted against it. I have 
Dr. Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government, beside me and I am going to ask him to comment on 
the information that we have just received. 
  [Silajdzic] Well, your colleague has already said most of 
it. We were not expecting such a significant and great victory. 
This Congress decision has now been submitted to U.S. President 
Clinton, who can veto such a decision. If he vetoes it, a 
two-thirds majority will be needed in the next vote in order for 
the United States to unilaterally lift the arms embargo for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we are dealing with a unilateral 
lifting of the embargo, which the UN Security Council can no 
longer influence. In case there is no veto -- presidential veto 
-- the embargo will then be lifted by this decision alone. If 
there is a veto, a two-thirds majority will be needed in the 
next vote in order for the lifting of the embargo to be 
realized. Thank you. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Silajdzic, if you are still with us, could 
you briefly comment on....[pauses]. President Clinton has a 
[word indistinct] right, and his statements -- we have been cut 
off -- have caused a veritable storm, which makes it very 
difficult to believe that there will not be problems connected 
to this decision -- the one passed by Congress -- all the more 
so because President Clinton has [words indistinct]. 
Nevertheless, as Prime Minister Silajdzic said, this is a 
great diplomatic victory.

  [Text] The Croatian mission at the UN in Geneva lodged a 
sharp protest over [Krajina president] Milan Martic's 
accusations against the Republic of Croatia. Croatian TV 
journalist Jozo Curic reports: 
  [Curic] Miomir Zuzul, the Croatian ambassador to the UN in 
Geneva, lodged a series of protests with Vladimir Petrovskiy, 
head of the UN in Geneva, and Owen and Stoltenberg, cochairmen. 
The Croatian mission informed them about the fact that, during 
his visit to the Palais des Nations, the UN enabled Milan Martic 
to spread propaganda and false accusations against Croatia and 
UN officials at a news conference. It was not the first time 
that representatives of the local Serbs from the UN protected 
areas [in Croatia] were granted unusual protocol and were 
treated by UN bodies as representatives of a state during a 
visit to Geneva. 
  This official protest was prompted by the fact that, while 
addressing several journalists, for the second consecutive day 
Milan Martic made accusations against the Croatian Government 
and president. When Martic arrived at the entrance to the 
Palais des Nations where many reporters and cameramen waited for 
the talks on a cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina to end last 
night, and again started making accusations against Croatia, the 
association of reporters at the UN interrupted his speech and 
requested that he be moved to another room. 
  Earlier Martic was received by Owen, Stoltenberg, and Akashi 
in Geneva. He asked for guarantees that the Croatian Government 
will not make a military advance into the UN protected areas, 
but did not obtain them. As Martic said, he did not obtain any 
guarantees or assurances by UN representatives.

  [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac visited Slovak 
Radio today. He replied to questions by almost 100 journalists 
from Slovak Radio and other domestic and foreign media. [passage 
omitted] 
  Kovac briefed them about the international position of 
Slovakia and steps being taken to strengthen it. [passage 
omitted] 
  During his visit, the president gave a more extensive 
interview to the program "Afternoon on the Radio." We have 
excerpted the following passages: 
  [Begin Kovac recording] In the last period, I would say 
within the past four to five weeks, I have really had many 
meetings. I received positive news during almost all of them, 
at last some positive news about Slovakia, positive news about 
the fact that the government is succeeding on the home front in 
consolidating the political situation, in stabilizing it--but 
most of all, that the government has succeeded in awakening the 
necessary trust abroad. 
  Of course, I was interested in finding out why this did not 
happen earlier--what the reasons were for our image not 
developing positively and why representatives of individual 
states were ignoring Slovakia when talking on various occasion 
about possible incorporation into the West European structures. 
Regrettably--and this was for me a very unpleasant discovery 
that I have to bring into the open--this was mostly connected 
with the persona of the [former] prime minister rather than with 
the overall activity of the [former] government. 
  At this point, it is not up to me to analyze the reasons for 
this state of affairs. I am only stating the fact, and I 
consider it necessary for the former prime minister himself to 
analyze, possibly together with others, the reasons for that 
situation. I think Slovakia cannot solve its problems without 
gaining the necessary trust in the East as well as in the West, 
in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. Furthermore, I 
wish to say that the present government, which has succeeded in 
gaining a good reputation, should be aware that it has to go on 
fighting to keep it. It is not sufficient to gain trust for the 
time being. It is a matter that should continue because it may 
also easily disappear. I firmly believe that the individual 
ministers are aware of this and also that their activities 
abroad have contributed to the more positive image Slovakia has 
finally achieved. [end recording]

  [Text] [Correspondent] Slovak President Michal Kovac will 
meet Hungarian President Arpad Goencz in New York on 21 June. 
Our Bratislava correspondent Ildiko Nagy reports: 
  [Nagy] Slovak Radio intends to set a precedent with the 
roundtable discussions that got under way today and where the 
participants are always invited journalists and a prominent 
personality. The guest on the first occasion was President of 
the Republic Michal Kovac, who replied to questions concerning 
Slovak domestic and foreign policies. 
  In answer to the Hungarian radio correspondent's question of 
what he would consider to be good relations with the new 
Hungarian state leadership, the Slovak president stated: On the 
basis of the statements heard so far, the future Hungarian 
Government will no doubt handle the nationality issue more 
realistically; many signs indicate that a solution can also be 
found to the matter of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water barrage, 
which burdens ties. He said he personally will strive to do 
everything in the interest of improving the two countries' 
relations because he knows how much other countries are watching 
this region and how much they want the Central European 
countries to become stabilizing factors. It is his conviction 
that the Hungarian side also sees it this way, said the Slovak 
president. 
  In answer to the question of the NEPSZABADSAG [Hungarian 
Socialist paper] correspondent of whether he would not like to 
open, jointly with Arpad Goencz, the border-crossing points that 
are in readiness, Michal Kovac replied that this had been 
planned earlier, with the intention of its being a gesture and 
of dissolving the tensions that existed at the time. Because at 
present it seems that, thanks to both sides, relations are 
becoming normal, the continuous settling of issues will be the 
task of the two governments and the individual ministries. 
  The presidential meeting could be the culmination of this, 
opined the head of Slovakia, who, on 21 June, when he accepts in 
New York the award for fostering good relations between 
neighbors, will meet Arpad Goencz, the other recipient of the 
award. Here the interstate agreement will also come up for 
discussion, opined Michal Kovac, who said he would be happy to 
come to Budapest to sign it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Gligorov-Nimetz Talks"] </F>
  [Text] The President of the Republic of Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov 
held talks in Skopje yesterday with the U.S. special envoy for 
the Macedonian-Greek dispute Matthew Nimetz, which were also 
attended by the Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski. 
  According to the announcement from the President's cabinet, 
they exchanged opinions on the present situation in the 
Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibilities of 
continuing the dialogue on the controversial issues. Also on 
this occasion, Macedonia's position in relations to the urgent 
need for a lifting of the blockade and the concept -- to discuss 
and solve all of the questions in a package, was reiterated. 
  President Gligorov placed an emphasis on the difficult 
consequences from the Greek embargo suffered by the Macedonian 
economy and the real threat this imposes to a broader 
destabilization in the region. He was also uncertain whether 
the latest round of negotiations with the mediators in New York 
would be able to provide a greater certainty as to the outcome 
of this situation, which is already becoming an evident element 
of threat to the stability in the south. During the talks, they 
also exchanged opinions on the further development of the 
relations between the United States and the Republic of 
Macedonia. 
  Mr. Crvenkovski stated that other topics were the situation 
in Macedonia, the damages caused by the embargo and the entire 
situation in the region. He expressed hope that it would soon 
come to another meeting with Nimetz, and that the talks with 
Cyrus Vance would be continued. 
  The U.S. special envoy Nimetz explained before the press 
that 
all of the sides in the negotiations have agreed that it is 
better not to disclose the essence of these sensitive 
negotiations in public, as it is a better way of conducting them 
more successfully. He stated that the talks were of great help 
to him in understanding the problem better, and that his 
function was to convey the stances of the two sides individually.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vaclav Musilek: "A Stable Europe Without </F>
Russia Is Just an Illusion"] 
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the North Atlantic 
Alliance's member states must solve a complicated puzzle. How to 
link together as tightly as possible Russia and the Alliance by 
means of the Partnership for Peace project and, at the same 
time, not weaken NATO itself. The ministers' meeting, which 
begins on 9 June, will discuss Russia's proposals for mutual 
cooperation. Although the Russians, through Defense Minister 
Grachev, have expressed their agreement with the Partnership for 
Peace, they have also pointed to its limitedness, which consists 
merely of establishing partial military cooperation. They want 
to conclude a separate agreement with NATO that would enshrine 
cooperation among the military departments at the level of 
relations between partners with global options and 
responsibilities and also cooperation in conversion and 
peacekeeping operations. The most contentious proposal from 
Russia is for the introduction of mandatory consultations on all 
issues concerning European and world security. In other words, 
Russia would like to obtain the right of veto in all of the 
Alliance's decisions, which was immediately rejected by the 
defense ministers of the member countries. 
  That is to say, they are very much aware that, with the 
gravity of Russia's agreement, NATO would lose its status and 
capability for action and would become just another cumbersome 
CSCE-type structure. Accorlding to Russia, the CSCE should play 
the role of an organization that coordinates the activity of all 
of the European security formations. If we take a look at the 
CSCE's results in the security sphere, it would seem that the 
Russians cannot mean such a proposal seriously. With a more 
detailed perusal of all of the pressures that affect the 
decisionmaking processes there, the impartial observer has to 
come to the conclusion that absolutely everything is possible. 
Fortunately, this does not apply to the West; so, although the 
Alliance currently lacks more explicit U.S. leadership, it is 
virtually out of the question that the foreign ministers will 
express themselves in favor of Moscow's proposals. However, 
whether we like it or not, Russia cannot be treated the same way 
as the Czech Republic or Poland. Russia's geographical area, the 
size of its population, and its widespread nuclear and other 
arms potential entitle NATO to adopt a special approach; of 
course, it is desirable for both the functioning of its 
structures and its relations with the states of Central Europe 
that this specific Russian feature is taken into consideration 
under the conditions and arrangements within the Partnership and 
not outside it. 
  In Istanbul, the NATO foreign ministers should weigh all the 
aspects very carefully and knit together a special doctrine for 
building stability not against Russia but with it, a doctrine 
eliminating the dangers arising from Russian power-wielding 
whims. The atmosphere of the subsequent negotiations between the 
Alliance's ministers and the individual Central European 
"partners for peace" will be determined by the outcome of the 
talks on the Russian proposals. It is mainly the Czech Republic 
and Poland, countries that are among the most serious contenders 
for membership and justifiably seek NATO protection against the 
threat from the East, that are extraordinarily sensitive to any 
sign of increased Russian influence in this region. In our 
country, this is felt even more by the citizens than by the 
politicians. "What we are mainly interested in is ensuring that 
closer ties between Russia and the Alliance do not mean even a 
hint of any division of spheres of influence," emphasized Jozef 
Zieleniec, in reaction to Moscow's demands regarding NATO. The 
idea of any kind of direct influence being brought to bear on 
our incorporation into West European structures and NATO, first 
and foremost, by the Russian side is unacceptable for our 
security. 
  The former Soviet satellites in Central Europe will have 
enough difficulties in convincing the individual NATO members 
about their contribution and gaining the unanimous agreement 
required for admission by Article 10 of the basic document--that 
is, of the North Atlantic Treaty. If I write about the 
inadmissibility of direct influence being brought to bear on the 
admission of the Czech Republic and other states into NATO, I do 
so with the knowledge that the situation in Russia is indirectly 
influencing this act in any case. It is slightly paradoxical 
that the hopes of Central Europe for entry into the Alliance are 
indirectly proportionate to the internal developments on the 
Russian political scene. The current "enlightened" government of 
President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, together with 
the substantial majority support for the reform course on the 
part of the population, is forcing NATO to adopt a cautious 
approach toward the contenders for membership so that the 
domestic position of the current Moscow leadership is not 
complicated. 
  The feeling of danger to postcommunist Europe would be 
increased along with a possible rise in the influence of the 
antidemocratically oriented forces, and a new onslaught of ever 
latent Russian imperialism and NATO could not, in its own 
interest, ignore the much more emphatic hammering on its front 
door. No one wants such development to the west of Russia. The 
basis for genuine European stability is, at this stage, to seek 
a suitable partnership with Russia with a view to its 
involvement in all important structures, including NATO, and 
that only at a later date, as opposed to the states of Central 
Europe. Without faith in the future definitive transformation of 
the "evil empire" into a civilized democracy, we would have to 
turn to completely different models for the security arrangement 
in Europe.

  [Text] At a meeting held today, the Leadership, 
Coordination, and Control Bureau of the National Peasant 
Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD] reached the conclusion that 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu has infringed upon the 
independence of the legal system in the statements he has made 
during his visits through the country by trying to influence 
judges in certain cases awaiting trial and by urging the 
ignoring of judge's final decisions, a communique received by 
ROMPRES reads. In conclusion, the aforementioned communique 
points out that in view of the fact that the head of state has 
exceeded his prerogatives through such statements and has 
seriously obstructed the perquisites of the judicial power, the 
PNTCD Leadership, Coordination, and Control Bureau has decided 
to open impeachment proceedings against Romania's president, 
through its parliamentary representatives, in accordance with 
Article 95 of the Constitution. 
  Referring to the communique issued by the PNTCD Leadership, 
Coordination, and Control Bureau on 10 June, Presidency 
Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu made the following 
statement, the contents of which we are presenting in full: 
  I consider the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau as 
an inadmissible offensive against the president coming from a 
parliamentary political party. This is a regrettable act, even 
embarrassing for its authors. The communique's allegations are 
most serious and devoid of any factual foundation. I do not 
know when or how Romania's president might have infringed upon 
the independence of the legal bodies. This is an unfounded 
accusation that I categorically refute. It is possible that, in 
its combat program against the country's freely elected 
president, the PNTCD has run out of all arguments and is now 
inventing something to artificially provoke tensions and divert 
the attention of the country's political forces and the 
parliament from the real problems that have to be solved now. 
This is painful and, I repeat, embarrassing for the authors of 
this initiative. 
  So concludes the statement of the presidency's spokesman 
regarding the communique of the PNTCD Leadership Bureau released 
today, 10 June 1994, by the ROMPRES agency.

  [Text] Relations between Romania and Hungary do not need 
mediators to be settled, Romanian Presidency Spokesman Traian 
Chebeleu said today at his weekly news conference, referring to 
certain commentaries that have appeared following the telegram 
that Gyula Horn, president of the Hungarian Socialist Party, 
sent to the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania. 
  Chebeleu said that numerous terms without precise content 
are 
being circulated, such as the term autonomy for minorities, and 
if this term refers to ethnic autonomy, this means quote, 
dynamite for the state unity of Romania, unquote, and is against 
European principles. 
  Referring to certain statements by Ioan Alexandru, PNTCD 
[National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] senator, 
Ambassador Chebeleu said that one cannot talk about a 
discriminatory attitude adopted by Germany in connection with 
Romania joining European institutions.

anthem of the Republic of Moldova, as decided by the Chisinau 
parliament. In a communique sent today to the ROMPRES news 
agency, that council assesses that the decision to make such an

The document also accuses the campaign of depriving the

  [Text] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] condemns the 
bombing carried out at the parliament building at dawn today. 
The MDF believes that there is no significant political force 
in Hungary today that would have an interest in creating 
confusion or disturbing the country's peace and order, the party 
communique stresses. The attempt could only have been carried 
out by an extremist individual or group, who or which cannot 
accept that the Hungarian nation, in free elections that were 
held for a second time, has decided in favor of multiparty 
parliamentary democracy.

  [Text] This is an abbreviated version of the 25 coalition 
guidelines that were laid down by the National Council of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] at the end of February. We 
literally quote the passages that the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP], judging from its program, might argue about. 
  1. A new or reworded constitution "that is identical to the 
current one in its basic principles." 
  2. To appoint the ombudsmen. 
  3. To provide solid guarantees for judicial independence. 
  4. To curtail the power of commissioners of the Republic and 
increase the independence of local governments. 
  5. Independent media. 
  6. Quick and public privatization controlled by parliament. 
"The state's role as owner has to be cut back." "To support" 
the participation of foreign capital, and to ease the 
participation of "domestic entrepreneurs and investors" in 
privatization. 
  7. To stimulate growth with the help of stimulating 
investments, reducing taxes, and by helping local authority 
investments and housing construction and the underdeveloped 
regions to catch up. However, in the meantime, "the current 
budget deficit must not be allowed to increase any further," and 
efforts have to be made to reduce inflation. 
  8. To continue the policy of foreign economic opening and 
fitting in with the developed foreign market systems, and to 
renew our economic links with the East-Central European 
countries "in accordance with the realistic possibilities." 
  9. To support all forms of enterprises and ownership in 
agriculture which have proved successful. 
  10. To reduce unemployment; this viewpoint should also be 
asserted in privatization. 
  11. To preserve the value of pensions, reduce the 
differences of living standards caused by family size, and 
assist in finding first homes. Welfare benefits "have to be 
more targeted through normative regulations." 
  12. Overall economic and social agreement with the employers 
and the trade unions. 
  13. To stop corruption. 
  14. To make health care available for everyone. "To 
continue the privatization of health care services," "to finance 
hospitals regardless of the sector." 
  15. Freedom to establish and choose schools. To have a 
neutral world view in education. To extend the range of people 
in further education. To abolish the regional educational 
centers. 
  16. Culture and science: To have patronages, but no control 
of contents. 
  17. Diversity in world views. To guarantee the separation 
of church and state. 
  18. To set up national minority local governments. 
  19. Join NATO and the European Union. Improve relations 
with the neighboring countries. We do not intend to change the 
borders. 
  20. To support the Hungarians living beyond the borders also 
by relying on the democratic forces of the neighboring countries. 
  21. Overall reform of military forces. We will "adjust the 
size and character of the Army to the changed security and 
economic conditions." 
  22. To strengthen public security. 
  23. To have a cheap and modest state. 
  24. To have better relations with the opposition, forces 
outside parliament, and the interested representation bodies. 
  25. To seek the possibilities of national reconciliation and 
to close the past in a way acceptable for a large section of 
society.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party and prime minister-designate, in the ORF studio 
in Innsbruck by Robert Hochner in the ORF studio in Vienna; date 
not given -- recorded; Horn speaks in Hungarian with 
superimposed translation into German] 
  [Text] [Hochner] You had a car accident prior to the 
elections and are wearing a support cast. How can one make 
politics with such a straitjacket around one's head? 
  [Horn] To formulate what you said more precisely, let me say 
that I had the accident at the end of the election campaign, but 
it did not affect our election opportunities, and I am 
continuing my work with undiminished intensity. We are very 
busy and are now continuing our coalition talks with the Free 
Democrats. 
  [Hochner] For a Western European party it would be unusual 
to win the absolute majority and then insist on a coalition 
partner. Do you want a coalition partner because you do not want 
to bear responsibility alone for the possibly tough economic 
measures that Hungary may have to face? 
  [Horn] Perhaps this plays a certain role, but what is most 
important is the fact that Hungary needs a broad national basis 
and national consensus. We must put an end to the past practice 
of political parties attacking one another, instead of assuming 
joint responsibility for the country's difficult situation. We 
are convinced that we should form a coalition with the Free 
Democrats, and we hope that such a coalition will come about. 
This may mean that an entirely new relationship between the 
parties will develop. In 1989, the Hungarian Socialists and Free 
Democrats were virtually enemies, and now we have a chance to 
form a coalition. This is very important, has a symbolic 
significance, requires essential political activities, and may 
be a signal for other Central Eastern European countries. 
  [Hochner] Are you planning to pursue a radically Western 
economic policy, as has been represented by Czech Prime Minister 
Klaus and was practiced in Poland for a long time, or will you 
try to pursue a central course to keep the sacrifices of the 
people, above all the lower social classes, within bounds? 
  [Horn] Look, there are no worn-out roads, neither for the 
Czech Republic, nor for Hungary, nor for any other country. 
Here in Austria, the system developed over the centuries, 
whereas we must tear down the former system within a very short 
time. This is an unprecedented effort. Privatization in 
Central Eastern Europe is unprecedented in world history. We 
will, of course, follow the Western example. 
  We would like to reach the status reached by Austria or the 
other Western European countries. However, we will pursue 
specific policies, and in so doing, we must consider the 
people's capacity for tolerance. We must not allow the 
transformation and democratic development to take place in such 
a way that the people's living standard continuously 
deteriorates. A line must be drawn somewhere, and I think the 
program of the Socialists, which can be coordinated relatively 
easily with the program of the Free Democrats, promises this, 
and most voters believe in our program. 
  [Hochner] Your party is the successor party to the Hungarian 
Communists; it reconstituted itself. Aren't there in your party 
also representatives of the trade union wing, for instance, who 
would rather opt for a concept from the past and would perhaps 
prefer to return to the planned economy? 
  [Horn] I do not know any politician in Hungary who was born 
after the spring of 1990. Somehow every politician was involved 
with the former system, including the opposition and the trade 
unions. But the trade union leaders, the whole trade union 
movement, underwent a transformation, and trade unions in 
Hungary today, including the large trade union federation with 
which we have an alliance, correspond to their Western European 
counterparts. 
  The influence of the trade unions was represented only in a 
small segment of parliament. I do not think a government can be 
successful without having concluded a social partnership, a 
partnership with the representatives of employers and employees. 
If such a consensus does not come about on all problems of 
social policy, Hungary will face many social explosions. It is 
an existential problem for us to achieve consensus not only with 
trade unions but also with employers. 
  [Hochner] In Austria, there is currently much talk about its 
possible EU [European Union] membership. In your view, when 
will Hungary be a member of the EU -- irrespective of the 
outcome of the referendum here? 
  [Horn] First of all, I would like to say that I envy the 
Austrians. I envy them for several reasons, but above all 
because they can already vote this Sunday [12 June] on whether 
or not they want to become EU members. I wish Hungary were in 
this situation. I am convinced that Europe is facing specific 
challenges, and Europe is advancing on the road to integration, 
and those who stay outside and do not take part will be 
disadvantaged. As for Hungary, I am convinced that, if these 
four countries become EU members in 1995, we may realistically 
assume that we can start talks with Brussels on membership of 
the Central Eastern European countries, the so-called Visegrad 
states, early in 1997. Regrettably, we cannot expect membership 
before the end of this century, or this millennium. I would 
like to accelerate it, and if we could exchange some Austrian 
problems for our problems, we would readily take over your 
problems in exchange for our problems. But what is important is 
that we are both heading for a united Europe.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Hungarian Democratic Forum leaders by </F>
unidentified correspondents; place and date not given; speakers 
identified by caption -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Sandor Lezsak, former executive deputy chairman 
of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, MDF] The fact that I have 
resigned the executive leadership of the Democratic Forum 
reflects my view that everybody should take stock as to what 
extent they were responsible for this very serious defeat. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Peter Boross, prime minister and member of the MDF 
Presidium] We have four years ahead of us during which we have 
to construct a modern, professional political party in the true 
European sense of the word by 1998--one that will be able to 
represent social interests to become a governing force again. 
  [Correspondent] To outsiders you represent the liberal line 
within the MDF, and now, you are the party's parliamentary group 
leader. Does this also mean a change in the political line? 
  [Finance Minister Tamas Szabo] I really respect the 
liberals, 
the national liberals working within our circle. Although I 
have never been a member of the Liberal Foundation, I have 
always played a serious role in the Christian democratic circle 
of the MDF, ever since it was formed. This is where my loyalty 
lies. [passage omitted] So in this respect, my person will not 
really bring change. [passage omitted] 
  Whenever there was trouble within the MDF, it was when 
somebody wanted to push one or the other of the MDF's three main 
ideological pillars--the national, the Christian democratic, and 
the national liberal ideology--to the forefront. If any of 
these trends becomes dominant the MDF is finished. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Does Peter Boross really represent another 
group within the MDF? 
  [Szabo] In my view, Peter Boross represents an extremely 
pragmatic line and has an enormous capacity for organizing. 
[passage omitted] He represents a fourth pragmatic wing and he, 
as a man thinking in terms of organizing and organization, 
approaches issues from a different angle. It is possible that 
he will have difficulties because every stream feels that he 
does not really represent any of them. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Does it mean, at the same time--since 
tendencies are linked to persons--that there is an unresolved 
debate in the MDF whether it should be a people's party, a 
program party, a party of law and order, or an action party? 
[passage omitted] 
  [MDF Chairman Lajos Fur] Obviously, it appears that winning 
the next election will be possible only with the oft-mentioned 
wider social basis, which is necessary in any case. Therefore, 
it is obvious that the MDF should move into the direction of a 
kind of people's party, which does not mean that the MDF will be 
a mass party in that it will have a mass membership, but that it 
should have a broad electoral basis; that it should put down 
roots in the various strata of the people, in the various social 
groups. 
  [Szabo] If anything can change in the MDF it is the fact 
that 
we will move in the direction of a completely balanced, modern 
conservativism, one that does not require a change in the order 
of values but demands a change of expression. 
  [MDF Deputy Balazs Horvath] The zealous and strong 
attitude-- 
which, on more than one occasion has irritated people, often 
unnecessarily--which exaggerated the national feature will 
obviously weaken, will be pushed into the background, if not in 
substance certainly in form. 
  [Correspondent] Does the MDF's defeat mean the defeat of the 
unity of forces of national sentiments [nemzeti eroek] as well? 
  [Fur]] The forces of national sentiments competed in this 
last election in a rather fragmented way--at least they were 
divided into several parties--but if I add up the results of all 
the parties of this kind, then I must say that their result was 
not all that bad. After all, more than 1.5 million people voted 
out of the 5.6 million for these parties, which means that this 
kind of thinking or set of political ideologies already has a 
wide basis. Obviously this basis must be broadened because, as 
we have seen, an election cannot be won through this and in this 
way. Possibly the fragmentation, too, needs to be resolved in 
some form and the forces will have to be concentrated. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist 
Party [MSZP], replied with a warm message to the congratulatory 
letter sent to him by Bela Marko, executive chairman of the 
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in 
Romanian], MAGYAR HIRLAP was informed by the office of the RMDSZ 
chairman. 
  Expressing thanks for the good wishes expressed on behalf of 
the RMDSZ, Horn pointed out in his letter that his party has 
always followed with great attention and sympathy the "heroic 
struggle of the RMDSZ for the survival of the ethnic Hungarians 
living in Romania and the full assertion of their individual and 
community rights," and that the MSZP has endeavored to support 
all this with their available means. Gyula Horn assured Bela 
Marko and the RMDSZ of the fact that "supporting the vital 
autonomy efforts of the Hungarians living beyond the borders" is 
one of the outstanding goals of the Socialists' government 
program. The MSZP is determined to do everything in its power 
to successfully assert this in the increased government 
responsibility of the party. Gyula Horn expressed his hope that 
he would be soon able to discuss the issue of "effective 
RMDSZ-MSZP cooperation" personally with Bela Marko.

  [Excerpts] According to a report on Novi Sad Television, 
weapons and military equipment have been discovered in aid sent 
by the Hungarian Ecumenical Charity [Magyar Ekumenikus 
Szeretetszolgalat]. The discovery was made during a customs and 
control inspection in Novi Sad. Our correspondent Szilveszter 
Varga, reporting from Belgrade, also gives an account of the 
continuing fighting in Bosnia. 
  [Begin Varga recording] [passage omitted] According to a 
report by Novi Sad Television yesterday, 15 Belgian-made 
submachine guns, more than 1,000 uniforms of the former East 
German Army, and other military equipment were found by Novi Sad 
customs officers in one of the three trucks the Budapest 
Ecumenical Charity sent to Kosovo. Representatives of the 
Hungarian aid organization -- which also has links with the 
Pravoslav Church -- stationed here have dissociated themselves 
from the affair. [end recording] 
  MTI's Belgrade correspondent also reported, on the basis of 
the Novi Sad Television account, that the aid delivery 
containing the military equipment was sent by the Hungarian 
Ecumenical Charity from Budapest to the Pristina-based Mother 
Teresa organization and that the documentation was signed by a 
Balazs Kek. 
  The Hungarian Ecumenical Charity resolutely denies and 
describes as provocative the Novi Sad Television report, which 
said that weapons and military equipment weighing 10 tons were 
found in their aid delivery during customs inspection. The 
charity also stresses that the delivery was made up of clothes, 
medicines, and food, and was not being sent to Pristina, the 
mostly Albanian-populated center of Kosovo, but to Novi Sad. 
  Following the regular customs inspection last Saturday [4 
June] the Yugoslav customs inspectors found both the documents 
and the delivery itself to have been in proper order because 
after off-loading, the trucks returned to Hungary. [sentence as

<F P=106> [Interview with Ferenc Gazdag, director of the Strategy and </F>
Defense Research Institute, by unidentified correspondent; place 
and date not given--first paragraph is PESTI HIRLAP introduction] 
  [Text] According to Ferenc Gazdag, director of the Strategy 
and Defense Research Institute [SVKI], the change of political 
systems has demonstrated the need for research institutes in the 
social sciences, institutes that promote the flow of 
comprehensive information and are also able to provide 
background analyses and forecasts quickly and accurately. At our 
request the director discussed one of the institute's most 
recent research studies--of the present state of the Ukrainian 
Army. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Sir, why was your institute established? 
  [Gazdag] The purpose of a research institute within a 
ministry's staff organization is to offer ideas and analyses to 
the ministry's political leadership, to demonstrate processes, 
and perhaps to prepare forecasts. It follows from the Defense 
Ministry's functions that we have to concern ourselves primarily 
with questions of national defense and security policy. In other 
words, the ministry's purview determines our work. Consequently, 
we are interested in all questions related to our country's 
defense and security and its system of relations with countries 
both near and far. We are studying particularly the questions of 
Hungary's security and also Central European, European, and 
global security. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] How systematic are your relations with the 
Ministry of Defense? How frequently does the ministry request 
analyses from your institute? 
  [Gazdag] Regrettably, a system of bilateral relations has 
not 
yet fully evolved. We prepare annual research plans, which are 
approved, respectively, by all the main departments within the 
ministry and by the state secretaries. Thus we have an approved 
research plan that is based in part on the types of research the 
ministry needs; we also suggest certain research topics. To tell 
the whole truth, however, our institute was established in 1990; 
we first have to develop and deploy our capacities, and only 
then will this bilateral process be able to function. At 
present, the ministry itself often does not know what it needs. 
Despite the substantial investment, one can never be certain 
about the return on it. After all, our research results appear 
in long-term studies, analyses, and books. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] What is your budget? 
  [Gazdag] We receive 20 million forints annually from the 
ministry, and our entire staff consists of 12 people at present. 
If we take into consideration that, since 1990, the ministry's 
budget has been declining gradually in real terms, it is 
conceivable that there will be changes at our institute within 
the foreseeable future. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] What are the institute's current research 
programs? 
  [Gazdag] I think it will suffice to list our principal 
directions of research. The first principal direction is the 
evergreen topic of the defense of the Republic of Hungary. The 
second principal direction is the security of Central Europe and 
of Europe proper. Incidentally, we are now preparing a 
conference, and a large volume of conference reports, both to be 
called The Security of Central Europe 1994 
[Kozep-Europa biztonsaga 1994]. New challenges, new dangers, and 
risks is what we call our third principal direction of research. 
We have to take into account that the world, or at least the 
immediate world around us, has not become any more secure, even 
though the bipolar system has disintegrated, the period of great 
military threats is over, and NATO and the Warsaw Pact are no 
longer confronting each other. Instead of the great nuclear 
threat, there now are many small but real threats. These threats 
involve many things that are not military factors, yet 
researchers must take note of them. The problem of refugees, for 
instance, also has security implications. Our fourth principal 
direction of research is the process of modernizing combat 
materiel and the structure of armed forces. Such research is 
definitely for the Hungarian Armed Forces. There is also a 
fifth, interesting and new area of research in which we are 
investigating the connection, the system of relations, between 
the armed forces and society. Research in this area became known 
in Hungary only a few years ago. 
  Over and above the principal directions of research, each of 
my colleagues has a favorite research topic he likes to pursue. 
Andras Balogh, for instance, is investigating the relationship 
between minorities and security; a lengthy article of his on 
this subject appeared in VALOSAG not so long ago. Another 
colleague is investigating the psychological aspects of 
security-policy conflicts; he, too, published his results 
recently in what has become the well-known Braun report. 
  Of course, we are also allowed to investigate topics that 
are 
not so prominently in the forefront of everyday thinking. Let me 
give you an example. Much as it is desirable for us to take part 
in European integration, it also raises many factors of 
uncertainty. Therefore it is our duty to investigate already 
now, for instance, what burdens would devolve on us from the 
realization of Hungary's strategic objective of attaining NATO 
membership. The average NATO country is spending 3 percent of 
its national income on defense, whereas Hungary is spending 
merely 1.6 or 1.7 percent. Which means that we would have to at 
least double our military budget if we wanted to upgrade the 
Hungarian Armed Forces ideally to NATO standards. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] Is the distribution of your institute's 
studies and reports restricted to the Ministry of Defense, or do 
members of the opposition also have access to them? 
  [Gazdag] Members of the National Assembly's Defense and 
Foreign Affairs Committees, and central agencies receive our 
reports by virtue of their office. Upon request, we gladly make 
our research results available to the expert of any party, 
regardless of his party affiliation. At the moment we are 
distributing our publications free of charge to officials on our 
distribution list, but we are also planning to make our 
publications available for sale to the interested public. As an 
example, let me mention that, with the help of NATO's 
Information Department, we recently published the NATO manual 
that explains how NATO functions. The manual was so successful 
that we have decided to print a second edition, but we will be 
charging a small fee for its copies, instead of distributing 
them free of charge. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] What are your relations like with other 
institutions of the Hungarian Armed Forces and with civilian 
research institutes at home and abroad? 
  [Gazdag] Research work is interactive. When someone 
discovers 
something, he is in contact with very many people and is working 
in a system of constant feedback. Most of my colleagues are 
teaching at universities, both civilian and military ones. We 
regard the Hungarian Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense as 
our customers whose requests we try to satisfy as 
comprehensively as possible. We like to rely on the work of our 
partner institutes, primarily on the Foreign Affairs Institute 
and the World Economy Research Institute. Our relations are 
outstanding with similar institutes in the neighboring 
countries. We often receive guest researchers; most recently, 
for example, we had colleagues visiting us from Poland. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] To our knowledge, members of your institute 
visited Ukraine recently. What experience have they gained there? 
  [Gazdag] There are very many forms of cooperation, including 
the mutual exchange of research materials, analyses, and 
studies. Last fall, for instance, a delegation of the Ukrainian 
General Staff's Scientific Directorate came to our country for 
consultations lasting several days. In return, Hungarian 
security policy experts were invited to Kiev for discussions, on 
26 through 28 April. Representing our institute, Colonel Dr. 
Laszlo Nagy was a member of the Hungarian delegation. Besides 
meetings with the official Ukrainian delegation, he held talks 
also with the heads of the International Research Institute of 
Regional and Global Security and with the military-policy 
adviser to the Ukrainian minister of defense. 
  During the consultations, our experts gained much valuable 
information on Ukraine's security policy and the state of the 
Ukrainian Armed Forces. They established that Ukraine is in an 
extremely difficult situation. The recession, inflation, 
insolvency, and dependence on Russia are very serious. Yet our 
partners in the consultations were a bit more optimistic than a 
year ago. They told us that the recession had bottomed out in 
some areas and that the country had not collapsed under the 
successive crises. The rate of inflation has slowed slightly. 
The parliamentary elections took place without any serious 
disruptions, and four-fifths of the 450 seats have been filled. 
The institutions of public administration have become 
stabilized, and the legislative backlog has been reduced to some 
extent. Although disputes with Russia are continuing with 
undiminished intensity, matters have not come to a head, and 
there remains the possibility of a negotiated settlement for 
every controversial issue. 
  Ukraine's international political assessment is improving, 
and its bilateral relations with the neighboring smaller 
countries are good. During the past two years and also at 
present, the Ukrainian Armed Forces have been undergoing 
substantive reform, but the process is by no means a smooth one. 
The trouble started with Ukraine's inheriting a randomly grouped 
part of the Soviet Armed Forces that happened to be on Ukrainian 
territory when Ukraine became independent, rather than an 
integrated army that gradually evolved in the course of 
Ukrainian history, in organic unity with society. According to 
our Ukrainian partners, their concept of having to reform their 
inherited armed forces was a mistake. It would have been better 
to aim immediately for complete reorganization and 
reconstruction. 
  This realization was two years late in coming; the euphoria 
of the initial period after declaring independence was not 
always accompanied by well-founded decisions, and a 
comprehensive conceptual plan was lacking. Work was hampered, 
for instance, by the decision that in 1992 the personnel of the 
Ministry of Defense could be brought up to only 50 percent of 
its original size. The strength of the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
gradually declined, from more than 650,000 at the time of 
independence to about 450,000 at present. In addition to the 
Army, there is also a National Guard about 50,000 strong. On the 
American model, the National Guard is able to reinforce the 
police primarily in emergency situations, without actually 
having to deploy the Army itself. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] In the case of Ukraine, nuclear weapons pose 
a 
separate problem. 
  [Gazdag] That is true. The trilateral agreement signed by 
Russia, Ukraine, and the United States in January, on Kiev's 
accession to the START I Treaty, has calmed tempers. Two 
shipments of nuclear warheads have already arrived in Russian 
since then, and Ukraine has received the promised fuel for its 
nuclear power plants. Kiev has undertaken to fully disarm itself 
of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the schedule specified in 
the START treaties. (In other words, Ukraine--unlike 
Russia--will not be retaining any nuclear weapons.) 
  On the other hand, Ukraine is not yet willing to accede to 
the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, although Ukrainian aversion 
to it seems to be diminishing. It is conceivable that Ukraine 
might revise its standpoint in the near future. Ukrainian policy 
on nuclear weapons, which is not always clear, has another 
aspect. In conjunction with the trilateral agreement signed in 
Moscow, there is a Ukrainian notion that appears to be spreading 
among military policy experts. It holds that only mediation by a 
third party could offer hope of any progress in resolving the 
controversial questions between Ukraine and Russia. 
  The advocates of this theory would like to involve at all 
cost a third party in the dispute over Crimea and the Black Sea 
fleet. The ideal third party would be the United States; should 
it decline to participate, however, the United Nations or some 
other international organization could also come into 
consideration. This theory is dangerous in the sense that 
Ukraine might try to delay its nuclear disarmament in an attempt 
to persuade Washington to enter the Ukrainian-Russian dispute. 
Although the United States has categorically stated on several 
occasions that it would not let itself be blackmailed, the 
possibility cannot be excluded that Kiev might resort to the 
questionable method of a tie-in sale. 
  Such a step would considerably destabilize relations 
primarily between Russia and Ukraine, which would not be 
indifferent from our country's point of view. Otherwise, Kiev 
regards as reassuring the development and existence of parallel 
European structures (the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe, North Atlantic Cooperation Council, Partnership for 
Peace, etc.), but finds all this inadequate to offset Moscow's 
growing efforts at reintegrating the Soviet republics. 
Incidentally, Ukraine is the only associate member of the CIS 
beside the Commonwealth's 11 regular members. 
  [PESTI HIRLAP] The information you have just outlined is 
merely of general interest at present. But how useful is all 
this to the SVKI? 
  [Gazdag] It is very useful in our work, primarily in 
developing optimal conceptual plans for our country's security 
policy. I have already mentioned that the SVKI is organizing an 
international conference on Central European security, to be 
held in Budapest on 16 and 17 May. Perhaps the most important 
item on the conference's agenda will be a comparative analysis 
of the conceptual security policy plans of the countries within 
the region. I will cite merely one fact to illustrate how 
serious this conference will be: NATO Headquarters in Brussels, 
and also the Marshall Center--an American research base 
established in Germany last year--have already informed us that 
they would attend.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F>
Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Dora Chichkova in Sofia on 6 
June: "If You Fight Battles of the Past You Remain in the Past"] 
  [Text] Zhan Videnov gave DUMA this interview after a long 
and sleepless night on the fourth day of the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] congress. Very tired, with bloodshot eyes -- which, 
according to people close to him, he has had for months -- he 
changed all known notions of ability to work and physical and 
moral stamina. He was chased by a mob of journalists, who no 
longer attach a different family name to his name, and remained 
calm, confident, and generous, as the undisputable leader of the 
greatest and staunchest Bulgarian party. 
  [Chichkova] Did you anticipate such an unconditional victory 
as party leader? 
  [Videnov] It is difficult for me to assess this. I can only 
say that I did not have any problems with the congress' tactic, 
because it fully springs from the strategy I have followed over 
the last two and a half years. This is a rather simpler, but 
very efficient strategy -- it relies on consistency, dignity, 
openness, and selflessness. Others relied on different schemes, 
and I think that they made a mistake, because as we all 
constantly say, the BSP is a changing party. None of its 
congresses repeats the previous one. Whoever wants to fight the 
battles of the past should remain in the past. 
  [Chichkova] I had the feeling that this was a struggle not 
only for the formal, but also for the informal BSP leadership. 
Does the congress put an end to the inner-party theme of the 
dual character of the power, and the theme about the existence 
of two or even more centers of power in the party? 
  [Videnov] I think that the existence of different sources of 
political impulse within the BSP is not only a trouble but a 
source of wealth for the BSP. We got used to working under such 
conditions and utilizing its advantages. We almost completely 
eliminated its obvious risks. Therefore, I do not view the 
problems regarding the BSP leadership as an action aimed at 
annihilating certain weapon emplacements of the enemy. On the 
contrary, I strive to connect all those manifestations of talent 
and initiative, responsibility and human dignity, into a common 
net. There are thousands of such manifestations, they form the 
BSP power, and there is no reason to separate them. 
  [Chichkova] Are you concerned with the future relations with 
the BSP Sofia city organization? I mean the recent tension that 
was evoked and the results of the congress. 
  [Videnov] I do not see reason for a lasting conflict. The 
BSP Sofia city organization was represented very strongly at the 
congress. I had the opportunity both to understand the 
congress' thinking and contribute to its forming. I think that 
in this process the Sofia delegates became convinced that they 
must correct some of their postulates. For example, the issue 
regarding the leaders' morals as a BSP problem. This could be 
the basic problem of another party, or a certain former party, 
but not of the BSP! No, this really is not a BSP problem. 
  I do not think that the party has the right to utilize its 
basic problems in an attempt to resolve tactical tasks. I mean 
ideological problems, management problems, and problems related 
to the party's dignity. Those problems must remain outside the 
realm of tactics. Tactical goals should be pursued by tactical 
means. The congress created the opportunity to utilize such 
means. I rejoice not at the fact that they failed, but at the 
fact that with certain minor exceptions, such means were not 
used at all. This shows that the party clearly distinguishes 
between its strategy and tactics, and is not inclined to use 
every acutely topical issue as a combat weapon. 
  [Chichkova] At the beginning of your first mandate you said 
something like "there is no Zhan Videnov political line." What 
could you say at the beginning of your second mandate? 
  [Videnov] If I remember correctly, I said that Zhan 
Videnov's political image is not clear to the party, and that if 
the party selected him, it must be aware of the risk it is 
taking. I do not know whether the party accepted this risk with 
open or closed eyes. I think that they were half opened. 
  Now, I again would warn the party of the same thing, as far 
as the leaders' issue is concerned. I did everything that 
depends on me to help the party form, clarify, and stress its 
ideological image. I did this also through my participation in 
the congress. I think that now the party has a better 
opportunity to calculate the risk it took. The new risk the 
party will have with its reelected leader is that ... I go a bit 
too far in seeking unity of ideas, words, and deeds. I demand 
this not only from myself, but also from all the rest, and the 
party as a whole. There are complex and deeply rooted inert 
processes in our party, and they change very slowly. In any 
event, I did not offend anyone. As far as the half-opened eyes 
are concerned, they could open completely at the next congress. 
  [Chichkova] Do the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress 
regarding the BSP political line preclude future dramatic splits 
such as the one that emerged at the last vote of confidence in 
the cabinet? 
  [Videnov] The congress confirmed the correctness of the 
political line implemented after the 1990 40th BSP Congress, 
despite all the complex vicissitudes in the political situation 
since then. I think that the congress' work was facilitated to a 
large degree by the last plenum of the BSP Supreme Council. It 
produced a good analysis, clear assessment, and precise 
explanation of the need for change. The congress understood the 
reasons why we maintained the line of stabilization throughout 
all those difficult months, and the reasons that prompted the 
change in this line. We decided to seek a solution through 
early elections this fall. 
  [Chichkova] Are the specific steps the BSP intends to adopt 
to win those elections clear? 
  [Videnov] We have two basic tasks. The first is to complete 
what we planned, paid for, and practically accomplished in the 
activity of the parliament and our relations with the cabinet. 
The second is to guarantee that free, honest, and democratic 
elections be held in Bulgaria in a stable situation, and that 
those elections will produce a mandate for a lasting and 
successful leftist-centrist government. 
  The first task is very difficult, but it could be 
implemented. I do not have the illusion, as some of the 
congress delegates, that from now on every parliamentary week 
will be similar to the last one. No, they will be completely 
different, and it will constantly be more difficult. 
  The second task is even more difficult, not because of the 
danger of an authoritarian degeneration of the transition or 
radical changes in the political situation and the positions of 
the other political forces. (I do not think that those 
possibilities are very plausible, but I do not underestimate or 
exclude them.) The difficult part is to overcome the thinking 
that we can assert ourselves through the negation of others. We 
must rely on the principle according to which we could and must 
negotiate with everyone. 
  Moreover, after two and a half years it is high time to 
soberly assess the possibilities of a practical leftist-centrist 
agreement. Unfortunately, such an agreement does not depend only 
on us. I assess the situation in the Bulgarian leftist and 
leftist-centrist forces as very bad. However, with a bit more 
commitment, consistency, insistence, and concentration of the 
BSP efforts, the situation there could probably change. 
  [Chichkova] Do you like the new BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Videnov] Yes, I definitely like the new BSP Supreme 
Council. I think that it can accomplish a lot. I rejoice 
equally at its new members and at the fact that the continuity 
in its membership represents the confidence in what my closest 
associates in the party and parliamentary leadership have 
accomplished in the last two and a half years.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Khristo Bardaliev: "Bulgarian Socialist </F>
Party Made Painful Step Toward Power"] 
  [Text] It is no exaggeration to say that the 41st BSP 
[Bulgarian Socialist Party] Congress was awaited with interest 
not only by society but also by the various parties and 
coalitions. The BSP supporters had good reason to expect (and 
demand) a clear stance on the current political and economic 
crisis. The main opponent of the BSP, the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces], convened a special session of the National 
Coordinating Council to enable it to react immediately to the 
congress decisions. The other parliamentary and 
extraparliamentary parties impatiently waited for the congress 
to end, mostly so that they could reorient themselves regarding 
the date of possible early elections and the potential chance of 
utilizing the "red" carrier rocket for new parliamentary seats. 
  Naturally, it is as yet too early to speak of any full and 
precise answer to these issues. Nevertheless, the main 
tendencies in the development of the BSP can be divined. 
  The most important thing -- for both the BSP and the whole 
of 
Bulgarian society -- was that the congress prevented 
restorational and nostalgic longings for the "bright past" to 
gain the upper hand in its decisions on the BSP program and 
statute. The rejection of the draft documents submitted by the 
"Marxist Alternative" faction is proof enough of this. 
  The convincing majority by which Zhan Videnov was reelected 
as leader indicates that his views will form the basis of the 
parties practical politics in the future. Incidentally, the 
conservatives did gain their revenge by preventing a number of 
prominent members of the OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy] 
from being elected to the Supreme Council -- people like Dimitur 
Yonchev, Velislava Dureva, Rosen Karadimov, and Elena 
Poptodorova. In this way the provincial delegates showed that 
they do not like free thinkers, or perhaps they merely think 
that they can thus make room for new deputies in the next 
parliament. 
  Andrey Lukanov's star also faded. Evidently, the accusations 
heaped upon him of banking swindles had their effect, or perhaps 
he had simply become an embarrassment, being too closely 
connected with the former leadership of the Bulgarian Communist 
Party, or again, maybe both factors played a part. 
  Surprisingly, Aleksandur Marinov also met with failure. It 
is difficult to say what he paid the price for -- his excessive 
personal ambitions or his too close connections with Aleksandur 
Lilov. 
  These personnel changes indicate something of real 
importance, namely that the BSP is taking difficult and painful 
steps along the road of replacing its dogmatic ideology with 
pragmatism. They also show that it already realizes the need to 
break out of the magic circle of insider quarrels about the kind 
of "social democracy" or "democratic socialism" that mean 
nothing in themselves, and is moving toward a specific program 
and concrete actions arising therefrom. 
  The party's specific program and actions will be determined 
by the internal balance within the BSP, between the party elite, 
linked with young Bulgarian business, and the mood of the party 
mass membership, which is dominated by the feelings of the 
sections of Bulgarian society with fewest rights -- the 
pensioners, peasants, and unemployed. 
  The BSP can no longer rely on cheap populist ploys, 
especially since it has attracted much opprobrium by its support 
of the Berov cabinet, support provided in the name of economic 
and social stabilization -- hopes that proved illusory. 
  The renunciation of direct ideologizing is even more 
necessary if the party wants to find allies for the upcoming 
election duel. The less said about concepts and the more about 
the nation's problems, the easier the BSP will find it to 
attract more of the better-quality parties and personalities. 
This will provide the best answer to the meaningless question: 
"Is the BSP changing?" 
  "He who does not advance loses ground" -- the BSP 
headquarters at 20 Pozitano Street has enough historians and 
philosophers who are well aware of the truth of this Latin 
saying. The question is whether the new leadership will succeed 
to turn "the word into flesh," as the Gospel puts it.

    [Editorial Report] The state of the Slovene economy, 
especially its strong position among the East European and 
Central European economies in transition, has been the subject 
of analyses in Ljubljana and Belgrade economic journals and mass 
media. 
  According to the 13 January issue of the Ljubljana economic 
weekly GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK, Slovenia enjoys a comparative 
advantage because it started its transition to a market economy 
as the "most developed" of the former socialist countries, 
although it is the smallest in population (2 million in 1992) 
and size (20,000 square km). In 1993 Slovenia led in per capita 
GDP ($6,186) and purchasing power ($8,500). While the transition 
to a market economy caused recession in all the former socialist 
economies, such trends were "less intense" in Slovenia. The 
journal also noted that Slovenia has better prospects than the 
Visegrad Group countries because the Slovene economy has been 
"traditionally export-oriented" and, as such, influenced by 
trends in the global economy. According to some economic 
experts, who have dubbed Slovenia "the Switzerland of the 
countries in transition," the country has already reached the 
level of the "less-developed members of the European Union." 
  The 19 May issue of GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK analyzed positive 
and 
negative trends in the Slovene economy. On the positive side, 
the journal pointed out that: 
  --After a period of stagnation and decline, the economy grew 
in the third quarter of 1993, indicating a gradual economic 
revival; 
  --The national currency, the tolar, has been stabilized -- 
the monthly inflation rate is averaging 2 percent, with 
inflation estimated to total 18.5 percent in 1994; 
  --Foreign debt is relatively low; 
  --Exports make up two-thirds of the GDP, the highest in this 
country group; 
  --Structural economic reforms and the rehabilitation of 
banks 
are "progressing successfully." 
  On the negative side, GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK noted a 15-percent 
unemployment rate caused mainly by recession in the industrial 
sector. Data show that unemployment continues to present "one of 
the most difficult problems," particularly among the "less 
educated work force." Although the private sector is rapidly 
expanding, it is unable to generate sufficient new jobs. The 
journal sees increased production as the only long-term solution 
to unemployment. 
  Another problem mentioned in the article is low productivity 
reflected in low wages. Slovenia's average monthly net wage of 
$415 nevertheless represents the highest reported monthly income 
among the former socialist countries. GOSPODARSKI VESTNIK 
concluded that Slovenia is on the right path to recovery, while 
conceding that the pace of privatization is lagging. 
  The 16 May issue of the Belgrade economic weekly EKONOMSKA 
POLITIKA observed that the Slovene economy "navigates well" 
between recession and postsocialist economic difficulties. 
Citing the financial journal EUROMONEY and the Vienna Institute 
for Comparative Economic Studies, the Belgrade weekly predicted 
"possible" economic growth for Slovenia in 1994 and stronger 
commercial activities, thanks to "new export markets" in the 
Czech Republic and Hungary. According to EKONOMSKA POLITIKA, the 
Vienna Institute anticipated 1-percent economic growth for 1994 
resulting from exports, 20-percent annual inflation, and 
18-percent unemployment. 
  Further confirmation that Slovene industrial production is 
increasing in response to growing local demand, ECONOMSKA 
POLITIKA reported, came from the Ljubljana Economic Institute in 
March. Institute economists attributed the increase in retail 
trade to the boost received from "invisible" exports to Croatia 
-- many Croatian citizens shopping in Slovenia. 
  Citing data from the Slovene Statistics Institute, EKONOMSKA 
POLITIKA noted that retail prices rose 3.9 percent in the first 
quarter of 1994, while the overall cost of living increased 4.7 
percent. The value of exports in January and February was $915.6 
million, with imports worth $856.1 million. Trade with the 
Yugoslav successor states continued to decline. 
  Signs of economic growth and general improvement in 
employment opportunities for 1994 have also been confirmed by 
the Ljubljana Economic Institute in its April survey of economic 
trends, as reported by Ljubljana Radio on 16 May and the 
Ljubljana daily DELO on 18 May. The Institute reported that 
rising production spurred by an increase in demand led to high 
levels of retail trade and a reduction in the stock of unsold 
goods. The following Institute data for the first quarter of 
1994 was published in DELO: 
  --Industrial production grew 3 percent compared to a year 
ago. 
  --Unemployment, while still "one of the key problems," has 
started to abate. 
  --Trade is balancing out. Foreign debt increased by $29 
million and foreign currency reserves by $148 million, nearing a 
total of $1.8 billion -- sufficient to cover 90 percent of 
Slovenia's total foreign debt. 
  --The large supply of foreign currency is supporting the 
exchange rate of the Slovene tolar, which was devalued by almost 
2 percent during the first four months of 1994. 
  --Inflationary pressures are diminishing despite a 
6.1-percent increase in retail prices and a 4.5-percent increase 
in manufacturers' prices.

<F P=106> [Article by Eva Zelenayova] </F>
  [Excerpts] The first Wednesday of each month only 
seemingly belongs to the residents of Bratislava. No one with 
even the slightest chance of getting into Bratislava to attend 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] rally misses an 
opportunity to hear Vladimir Meciar and his coworkers speak. 
This week, too, the banners in the "Na Pasienkoch" indoor 
stadium revealed that people from Prievidza, Topolcany, Nove 
Zamky, and Komarno, as well as Slovaks from the United States, 
were present. [passage omitted] 
  As usual, HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar was the first to 
take 
the floor: [passage omitted] "Esteemed ladies and gentlemen, 
allow me to thank all of you who have come here this evening to 
meet HZDS members and leading officials and their present and 
future coalition partners. (applause, followed by the reminder 
that today is the Day of the Child) Our rallies will soon 
require a bigger stadium. (....) The rallies attract 
considerable attention; no lesser person than the president 
himself is their commentator. (applause) Whenever we meet, it 
creates ripples, and there is something to write about. (....) 
Over the past two weeks, I crisscrossed Slovakia from east to 
west, and everywhere I came across uncertainty, irritation, 
unrest, and a longing for action. It is becoming apparent that 
it was a big mistake to postpone the elections until September. 
They should have been over by the end of June because 
parliament and society (unceasing applause) are getting into a 
deep depression and parliament into a profound moral and 
political crisis. Of course, the developments of the past few 
weeks raise questions and call for answers. First of all, I 
would like to pause to consider some activities of the 
government that distress us. There is nothing to praise, nor 
will there be anything to praise. But there are plenty of 
things to rail against and many reasons to swear. First of all, 
the political background of the government had been shrouded in 
fog and concealed. Everyone was telling us that we were lying 
when we spoke about the existence of an eight-point agreement 
between the government and the Hungarian political parties. 
(noise in the hall) Although we can deduce from reports what 
these eight points are, we emphatically ask the government to 
publish the secret agreements so that we can learn whose vassal 
it is and whom it wants to serve. (applause) We want to know 
why the government accepted and pledged to implement the program 
of the Komarno appeal of January 1994 [containing demands of the 
ethnic Hungarian minority], which has been condemned by the 
majority of the citizens of Slovakia. Whose government is this? 
Who does it represent?" 
<H5>  Balladur Plan Is Superfluous </H5>
  Vladimir Meciar then devoted himself to the itinerant 
activities of the Moravcik government and said, among other 
things, that he considers the Balladur plan superfluous in view 
of existing agreements. "We want the same rules for all 
minorities to be adopted in Europe and for them to have the same 
level of protection (applause) in our country that they have in 
the West. We are in favor of the codification of those rights, 
and then it will not be necessary to conclude agreements calling 
in question our position and our situation." 
  The Socialists' victory in Hungary means no change in policy 
regarding the minorities, Vladimir Meciar continued, and 
stressed that there will not be any staking out [of 
Hungarian-inhabited territory] by means of signposts! "We also 
find distressing the questions of guarantees of democracy. We 
are turning to citizens before decisive moments. We did not 
seek parliamentary intrigues, the disintegration of other 
parties, and the infliction of damage on our competitors. We 
were looking for a way of expressing the citizens' will. A 
constitutional law has been passed, according to which there 
will be elections. As we see, however, pressure for the 
acquisition of 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws] 
continues in the National Council, and, as this pressure keeps 
growing, fears justifiedly arise about whether we will be able 
to defend the election date on parliamentary soil, so that the 
elections really take place on 30 September 1994. Therefore, as 
soon as the law on referendum is passed, we will initiate a new 
collection of signatures for a referendum. (applause)" 
<H5>  There Should Have Been a Referendum </H5>
  Meciar explained how they became convinced that the 
referendum should have been called. The number of valid 
signatures that were collected was sufficient: 372,000. He said 
that the government's travels were very costly, adding that 
"they travel because they know it is the last time." And how 
did Vladimir Meciar assess some economic steps of the 
government? "We are rightly distressed by what the government 
has done. While they proclaimed that they would take over our 
policy and carry on what we had done, they are acting in the 
typical Moravcikite way--two steps on the spot, the suggestion 
of a step forward, and two steps back. Our policy was guided by 
a simple philosophy, which said that it is impossible to 
economize any more and that, to be able to spend more, it is 
necessary to earn more money and to raise earnings. The present 
government's policy says that it is still necessary to save. 
These savings should squeeze out of citizens about 7.5 billion 
korunas, which will be felt mainly by poor people who cannot 
afford it. But entrepreneurs should not think that this does 
not concern them because, when the tax on repairs and services, 
including public catering, goes up 20 percent, their market will 
be reduced in size and many small businessmen will be driven by 
this policy to bankruptcy. (....) Because the government 
neglects monetary flows, bank credits are becoming more 
expensive, and the interest rate on loans has reached 30 
percent.... We cannot agree with that. Nor do we identify with 
the approach toward privatization. (....) We are against 
pseudoprivatization." 
  Turning to the HZDS program, Meciar said: "We do not 
renounce the national program, but it is not the sole pillar; it 
is one of the pillars of our program. The time has not yet come 
for us to say that the state has become so stable that 
everything has been resolved. As long as the process of 
definite stabilization is not completed, we do not have the 
right to renounce this program, in contrast to those who do not 
want to respect either the state or the national program." 
[sentence as published] (applause) 
<H5>  Sixth Government in Four Years </H5>
  At the close of his address, the movement's chairman said: 
"We consider it appropriate to adopt, shortly after the 
elections, measures to stabilize the political system. The 
Slovak Republic cannot continue like this. It will have the 
sixth government and the fourth parliament in four years. This 
brings enormous losses, which are also expressed in terms of 
money." And, before [moderator of HZDS rallies] Gabo Zelenay 
grabbed his microphone for a while, he said: "We do not have a 
program for ourselves, we have it for Slovakia. (applause) We 
are not going to fight against Weiss or Carnogursky. We want to 
fight for the Slovak Republic." (applause) 
  It was time for the citizens' questions. [passage omitted] 
An interesting question was addressed to Meciar: What should be 
done with deputies so they do not betray again? "First of all, a 
law will have to be passed regulating the loss of mandate [of 
deputies who leave the party for which they ran in the 
elections] because moral and ethical norms have insufficient 
impact. A group of subversives cannot be allowed to seek the 
state's weakness in the weaknesses of people. [sentence as 
published] We assure you that instances of suspected corruption 
of people who have left us will all be investigated." [passage 
omitted] 
  [Former Defense Minister] Imrich Andrejcak received 
questions 
bearing out that, even in the Army, not everything can be kept 
secret. "Why did the president appoint Docent Zak, an officer 
of Czech nationality, as rector of the Military Academy at 
Liptovsky Mikulas? Do we not have enough Slovak officers? He 
was appointed because he had been proposed by the minister of 
defense, and we do have Slovak officers. The same mistake 
occurred in Kosice [seat of the Air Force Academy]. The rector 
there is admittedly a Slovak, but a person who cannot himself 
fly is training pilots there. (laughter) Under Docent Zak, 
teaching in the Czech language was resumed in Liptovsky Mikulas 
(booing) and is being tolerated despite Slovak officers' 
protests. (....) Here is one long question, which I am not 
going to read. I will only say in response that I will propose 
to our deputies in parliament that they initiate an inquiry into 
whether some functionaries of the Ministry of Defense and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs are citizens of the Slovak Republic 
in the first place." (commotion in the hall) [passage omitted] 
  At the end, it was again Meciar's turn. Asked about the case 
of [Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac, he replied: "He has not 
filed any suit against me thus far nor will he file one because 
he is afraid of it like the devil of holy water because many of 
us heard this admission. It is to this government and 
parliament's disgrace that they keep him among themselves. And 
it is also his personal disgrace." Replying to a question about 
the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], he said: "We do not 
identify the entire SDL with Weiss, Ftacnik, Siroky, and 
Dorotin. They represent a deviation [uchylka] in the SDL. SDL 
members should therefore ponder what to do when their leadership 
deflects." Asked whether it is true that [former chairman of 
the Public Against Violence Movement] Fedor Gal is Weiss's 
extended arm in Prague, he said: "I cannot confirm that because 
I have no information about it. What I do know, however, is 
that on Easter Monday in 1992, when the balance of power in 
Slovakia was already clear, Messrs. Weiss and Filkus had been 
invited to the president [Havel] for talks, the contents of 
which we have never been informed. Although we were party 
colleagues then, we do not know what happened at the Castle that 
day." He explained, furthermore, how two members could 
nonchalantly move from one government to the next: "They claim 
with haughty calm that everything is okay. They say with haughty 
calm that one must not be confrontational. At the same time, 
they regard as confrontational everyone who has a different 
point of view from that of the present Politburo. But evil must 
always be countered. Evil must be resisted even if that means 
confrontation. (applause) We are not transcending the limits of 
democracy, but we are not going to pretend that everything is in 
order only to avoid being labeled confrontational.... According 
to this government's understanding, being nonconfrontational and 
understanding means being stupid. Don't get excited, they tell 
us. We are only going to suck the blood out of you (laughter). 
True, that is exactly what they are doing with us. They have 
only taken money out of our pockets. They are only threatening 
us with the division of the state. They only undignifiedly 
represent us abroad and behave there as representatives who are 
incapable of managing their own affairs. They only damage social 
relations. Otherwise, they have done nothing to harm us, so why 
are we not satisfied? All of this is enough for them not to be 
where they are now. (....) For this reason, it is necessary that 
this dispute be decided by the citizens as soon as possible, and 
we must consider which democratic means to use within the 
framework of the struggle against them." [passage omitted] The 
participants in the rally applauded. The three-hour marathon of 
words was coming to an end.

<F P=106> [Article by "rk": "In Every Secret Ballot, Nine Coalition </F>
Deputies Supposedly Side With the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--When giving consideration to 
postelection coalitions, we do not seclude ourselves from 
anyone, with the exception of Miklos Duray. The decision on who 
will be our partner will be made by the voter, Vladimir Meciar, 
deputy to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and 
chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS], said 
at yesterday's "13 Plus One" meeting organized by the editorial 
staff of SLOBODNY PIATOK. According to what he said, the 
question of holding elections has not been definitely settled 
because "in the course of the current meeting of the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic, our deputies have been 
approached by two people--Deputy Gburova, with the proposal that 
the election date be postponed by two years, and Deputy Bajan, 
with the request for four more [HZDS] deputies so that they get 
the 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws]." Vladimir 
Meciar also contested reports about nocturnal meetings of his 
government to approve privatization projects: "After the 
passage of the vote of no-confidence in us, we had dinner and a 
friendly chat about what we would do the next day.... We were 
not approving any privatization projects; that had been done 
before, and even that concerned only four or five projects, I 
think, and I was not personally present." Meciar claimed that 
parliament is in a state of decay, which he supported by saying 
that, whenever there is a secret ballot in the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic, nine people vote along with the HZDS. 
Supposedly, these deputies only failed during the dismissal of 
the government, but they had already apologized to him and 
explained their reasons.

<F P=106> [Article by Ludmila Benkovicova of the Slovak Statistical </F>
Office] 
  [Text] We regularly publish the results of public 
opinion surveys conducted by various specialized institutions. 
Their results are not quite identical. We have asked Ludmila 
Benkovicova, of the Slovak Statistical Office, to compare the 
results and explain the differences in the methodology used. As 
she noted in an introductory letter to her article, she had 
consulted the problems under review with the FOCUS agency and 
Slovak Radio. As an important contribution of this activity, 
they agreed on the need to coordinate in the future at least the 
use of terminology because, as she writes, "the differences 
disconcert all of us." 
  Why do different polls produce different results? 
  I will mention at least the most important factors 
influencing the ascertained results of public-opinion surveys. 
  Generally, it holds true that the obtained empirical data 
are 
significantly determined by the time of collection of 
information in the field. Public opinion is a dynamic 
phenomenon. It reacts with particular sensitivity to events in 
public and political life, new facts and information, 
politicians' statements and speeches. A shift of a few days in 
the collection of data, especially if these days are packed with 
political activities, can find its expression in changes of 
opinion among a part of the population and, hence, in altered 
results. 
  A problem in its own right is when to perceive 
differentiation of data as true differences and when certain 
differences are still within the norm. Some commentators and 
users interpret as a difference even a decline or rise by a few 
tenths of a percent. 
  It is necessary to clearly realize that surveys working with 
select samples--and this is true of all public-opinion surveys 
without exception--are surveys of likelihood nature [vyskumy 
pravdepodobnostneho charakteru]. They produce data, the 
validity of which is not absolute but that are always valid, 
with a certain probability within a certain interval of 
reliability. The interval of reliability has its lower and 
upper limit, and the figure that is given as the result is the 
midpoint of the interval. This means, for example, that the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], which, according to the May 
1994 survey of the Slovak Statistical Office, availed itself of 
11 percent of votes, would have received in "May" elections, 
with a likelihood of 95 percent (the margin of error is 5 
percent!), 8.7-12.7 percent of the votes of participants in the 
elections. 
  The final results are also affected by the research method 
that is used, starting with the method of establishing the 
select sample, through the method of data collection, all the 
way down to the specific wording of the question put to the 
respondent. 
  Let us take a closer look at the questions used by various 
institutions. Slovak Radio's Research Department, whose 
electoral surveys frequently appear in the mass media, uses the 
following question: "Imagine that parliamentary elections were 
to take place this week. For which party or movement would you 
opt?" This question is put to every respondent. The respondent 
can select his reply from 20 entities running in the elections 
(out of more than 50 officially registered parties and 
movements). He is free to supplement his reply with any other 
party, but he can also reply "I am not going to vote," "I do not 
want to reply," or "I do not know." The sum of all replies adds 
up to 100 percent. 
  The FOCUS agency asks two questions. In the first, it 
ascertains interest in participation in the elections, and, in 
the second, it surveys how the respondent would vote. It offers 
a choice of 15 entities running in the elections and, 
simultaneously, the replies "I am not going to vote," "I do not 
know for whom I will vote," and "I do not want to reply." The 
two questions are put to all people included in the select 
sample. By means of combining replies to the first and second 
questions, the FOCUS agency obtains the electoral preferences of 
individual parties. 
  The Slovak Statistical Office addresses to all citizens 
polled a question concerning their participation in the coming 
elections. The second question--"For which political party or 
movement would you vote if elections to the National Council of 
the Slovak Republic were to be held today?"--is put to only 
those respondents who said at the time of the survey that they 
are determined to vote or that they are likely to vote. It 
offers a list of 18 entities running in the elections, the 
possibility of naming any party not included in the list, and 
the reply "I do not know for whom I will vote." The electoral 
decisions of those of the respondents who want to participate in 
the elections are then interpreted as electoral preferences. 
The aim of this methodological procedure is to come as close as 
possible to the actual "pure" situation of casting the vote. 
  The electoral results are directly determined by those who 
come to the ballot box. Even the most unbending sympathizer of 
a party cannot support "his" party with his vote if he does not 
turn up at the polling station. It would be appropriate to pay 
more heed to this trivial fact when presenting the results of 
preelection polls. 
  The use of a different term (such as, for example, 
"political 
sympathy," "political orientation of the population," etc.) 
could therefore be considered for expressing attitude. The term 
electoral preferences should be reserved for the electoral 
decisions of participants in the elections--that is, those who 
want to come to the ballot box on the last day of September or 
the first day of October. 
  The reality of the '94 elections will test not only the 
validity of various preelection prognoses but also the 
theoretical justification of the methods used. For the time 
being, the reader and user who is seriously interested in 
preelection surveys has no choice but to pay heed not only to 
the "figures" themselves, but also to the wording of the 
question, the wording of all of the optional replies, and to 
what each item of data actually expresses.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic by </F>
Dragan Colovic on the "An Argument More" program; place and date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Colovic] Minister Jovanovic, our public received 
with great trepidation the news from Washington that the U.S. 
Congress House of Representatives had, by a great majority, 
adopted the amendment demanding that President Clinton 
unilaterally lift the arms embargo for the Bosnian Muslims. How 
do you see this? 
  [Jovanovic] This is a continuation of the position in U.S. 
policy, which from the beginning of the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been insisting on a so-called hard 
solution, on pressure, on blackmailing the Serbian side in the 
hope that this would yield maximum results. This line in the 
U.S. policy is not always consistent; very often it is in 
contradiction with the official line that has always been a lot 
more considerate and has taken into account the repercussions of 
such a position on other U.S. interests, on relations with the 
allies, and finally, on the U.S. strategy of using sanctions on 
a global scale, whenever U.S. state or national interests 
warrant it. Therefore, a possible surrender to this hard line 
could initially bring some advantages to immediate U.S. policy, 
but, in the long run, it would threaten many other goals, 
particularly the option of using sanctions as the most lethal, 
albeit most inhuman and most undemocratic means in the current 
policy of this great power. 
  On the other hand, the Islamic lobby -- which is very 
powerful and which is just a herald of the monolithic political 
bloc of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] -- is active 
in all spheres, and it is particularly focused on the U.S. 
decisionmaking centers, knowing that if it manages to win over 
the United States, it will have an easier time dealing with the 
other political factors. In this respect, President Clinton is 
certainly exposed to immense pressure -- both internally and 
externally -- which he has so far successfully resisted. The 
assumption and the logical conclusion is that the President will 
succeed in resisting this to the end, because all the pros and 
cons of such an action -- the unilateral lifting of the arms 
embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina -- imply that the cons would 
prevail over the pros, and that the number one man of this great 
power would have to be a great gambler to opt for this 
voluntarily. The threat is nevertheless serious, this time it 
comes from the united Congress -- both wings of Congress have 
practically voted in favor of lifting the embargo -- and 
President Clinton will need a lot of skill, strength, and time 
to relativize this pressure and to maintain the peaceful option 
as the general option in his country's policy toward the crisis 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I believe that he will look for strength 
of argument for his position in the dynamics of the peace 
process in Bosnia-Herzegovina itself or about Bosnia-Herzegovina 
[sentence as heard]. I believe that this is the best way to 
match this warmongering wing, which does not only come from 
within -- from the U.S. Congress -- but also from an extremely 
militant Islamic bloc that is on the offensive and is trying to 
minimize the significance of the achievements -- modest as they 
may be -- of the peace process so far, and is trying to 
marginalize and diminish the process itself. 
  [Colovic] Minister, earlier you mentioned the sanctions. It 
is interesting to note that this dangerous U.S. congressmen's 
initiative comes at a time when the first hints of a change in 
U.S. policy toward the events in Bosnia-Herzegovina are becoming 
apparent in the sense that the U.S. President has announced the 
possibility of relaxing the sanctions toward the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia. How do you explain this? 
  [Jovanovic] Well, you see, it is probable that the [word 
indistinct] Congress for the lifting of the embargo and the 
announcement of the possibility of relaxing the sanctions are 
part of the same policy -- the policy of a stick and a carrot. 
On the one hand, the possibility of lifting the embargo is 
intended to apply psychological and political pressure on the 
Serbian side in Bosnia-Herzegovina so that it becomes frightened 
and more yielding in the peace negotiations, while on the other 
hand, the announcement of the possibility of relaxing or lifting 
the sanctions should apply a similar pressure that would reflect 
on, and as such be registered by the Muslim side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. These two things are, after all, part of 
the same whole, although each one has its own autonomy, 
particularly the first one that concerns the embargo, of which I 
have already spoken. 
  The important thing for us is that this positive evolution 
in 
the U.S. Administration's position toward the sanctions is, at 
least verbally, continuing. Moreover, for a month and a half 
now, we have had these new tones that imply that the policy of 
this country toward the sanctions is not firm, but is also a 
dynamic process that can be adjusted depending on the positive 
changes in solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is 
probably a reflection of the fact that the United States -- 
along with all of Europe, with the exception of Austria, 
Albania, and Turkey -- is also becoming aware of the fact that 
the sanctions have lost their raison d'etre, that they are 
beginning to inflict losses on their initiators, and that they 
are beginning to think about how to rid themselves of these 
sanctions without losing face and particularly without losing 
face on the ground. [sentence as heard] It is conceivable that 
all this is part of a whole, and it would not surprise us if the 
United States -- providing some undesirable turnabout does not 
happen in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- were to give us a new, similar, 
positive surprise in the coming weeks. 
  [Colovic] A pleasant surprise in any case. Mr. Jovanovic, 
in recent days, the international factors have been trying to 
speed up and intensify the peace process, particularly after the 
one-month cease-fire was accepted. All this is aimed at urging 
the acceptance of a territorial demarcation, and finally a 
political solution. What developments can we expect after 
Geneva? Are not perhaps certain pitfalls also present in this 
speeding up of the process? One of the pitfalls could be that a 
solution might be imposed which, instead of contributing to the 
end of the war, could lead to its escalation? 
  [Jovanovic] First of all, this progress, the one-month 
cease-fire -- which is very modest -- is nevertheless progress 
because it maintains the momentum of both the negotiations and 
the relative stabilization of the situation on the ground. 
However, it is so minimal that to count on it in any way would 
be to grossly deceive oneself. We need to urgently invest new 
and essential efforts in order to prevent the Muslim side -- 
once the month is over -- from launching military operations, or 
complicating both the negotiations and the situation and in this 
way forcing the whole world to go with their variant rather than 
the peace variant that is the current name of the game. 
Therefore, there is a realistic chance of the Muslim side 
setting traps, and it stems from both the Muslim side in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and from its friends and supporters on the 
other side -- the Islamic bloc and friends in the U.S. Congress. 
  On the other hand, hints that the new division and the new 
package of the peace solution could be placed on the table in 
the form of take-it-or-leave-it, must not be lightly dismissed 
because it is obvious that this type of activity at 
international meetings is pretty familiar, particularly to 
certain Western powers. The problem is that until now, this was 
only employed on the Serbian side in Bosnia, and on Yugoslavia 
in connection with the Yugoslav crisis, whereas it was never 
employed on the other sides. Even if this time it was employed 
against both, or all three sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, there 
would still be a realistic danger that this pressure -- in 
respect to the Serbs in Bosnia -- would be overdone, more 
pronounced than the possible pressure on the Muslims. 
  Finally, the fact that it has been implied that the Muslims, 
in exchange for the lifting of the arms embargo, could be, so to 
speak, punished by the relaxation of the sanctions against us, 
is not proportional, because the lifting of the sanctions [as 
heard] would be an introduction to a long war, while the 
relaxation of the sanctions would be just a partial alleviation 
of Yugoslavia's position under the burden of sanctions. We must 
be careful and the international community must be reminded of 
something it kept reiterating, which is that it would respect 
the consensus of the warring factions and that it would not 
impose the political solution of either side. If it were to 
adhere to this, then there would be no danger of this happening. 
  However, we must not forget that a year ago, during the time 
of the Vance-Owen plan, there was an attempt at imposing such a 
solution on one side -- the Serbian side -- in Bosnia, and that 
after it rejected this, the famous UN Security Council 
Resolution 820 was passed. Therefore, all the cards are in the 
game, nothing has been excluded in advance, and it is possible 
that the international community -- under the pressure of an 
ultimatum-like offer -- will aim it at only one, the Serbian 
side, while the other side is faced only with a cosmetic 
ultimatum [sentence as heard]. This unbalance, as a consequence 
of the double standards applied so far in solving the Yugoslav 
crisis, is still predominant in the policy and position of the 
leading Western countries.

  [Text] Belgrade, 10 Jun (TANJUG) -- The FRY expects the 
cease-fire signed in Geneva on Wednesday by representatives of 
the Bosnia- Herzegovina warring sides to be an introduction to a 
permanent peace, according to a statement issued today by the 
Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  The statement welcomes the agreement on the cessation of 
hostilities and says that "even though it would have been much 
better for the successful continuation of negotiations and 
attainment of a final political solution if the sides had 
reached agreement on a permanent peace, or at least on a 
long-term cease- fire, this agreement can serve as an impetus 
for ending the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis." 
  The statement goes on to say that full compliance with the 
one- month cease-fire is important, because only then can this 
short period of time be used to make progress in the 
negotiations. 
  It is necessary that the international players attentively 
and objectively follow further developments on the ground and 
sanction each attempt to violate the cease-fire, irrespective of 
the source. As for the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it has 
on a number of occasions expressed its orientation toward peace, 
continuation of dialogue, and cessation of all hostilities. 
  The forthcoming one-month period must be used in the best 
possible way for finding a final, just, and permanent solution 
of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Regardless of the fact 
that it is not one of the warring sides, the FRY is ready to 
make a maximum contribution to realizing this goal, the 
statement says.

  [Text] Kragujevac, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence 
Minister Pavle Bulatovic said on Sunday that the defensive 
capability of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) was 
well maintained despite the big problems and all objective 
hardships caused by the two-year-old international sanctions. 
  Bulatovic, in an interview to Radio Kragujevac, Serbia, 
pointed out that the Army of Yugoslavia had a highly developed 
system of the country's defences. 
  "It is common knowledge," said he, "that Yugoslavia does not 
have any territorial claims on any of its neighbours, but it is 
ready to respond to aggression of any kind." He confirmed that 
some of the neighbour states were launching provocations along 
the Yugoslav borders, counting on external support. This, as he 
said, was nothing new, because they used to do the same whenever 
they thought Yugoslavia was weakened by internal troubles and by 
pressures exerted by the big powers. 
  Asked about the danger of Yugoslavia's being involved in 
war, 
with reference to NATO violations of Yugoslavia's airspace, 
Bulatovic said that ``no one in his right mind has any interest 
in involving Yugoslavia into a war, as this would widespread the 
war conflagration in the Balkans, and it is the big question 
whether (the war) would be limited to this area alone. 
  "Every impartial observer may realize that Serbia and 
Montenegro, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, had not 
started the war on the soil of the former Yugoslavia, and that 
they have no intention of including themselves in it. On the 
contrary, they are doing their utmost for paths to be found for 
the establishment of just and lasting peace in these areas," 
said Bulatovic.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 10 Jun (TANJUG) -- Federal Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic said today that an extraordinary 
parliamentiary session would be justified only if implementation 
of the economic stabilization program was threatened. 
  Speaking at a regular news conference he said that the 
government will closely monitor the implementation of this 
year's economic policy and, depending on the situation, would 
decide whether or not to convene an extraordinary session. 
[passage omitted] 
  Answering a question about the cease-fire in the former 
Bosnia- Herzegovina and the decision of the House of 
Representatives of the U.S. Congress on the lifting of the 
embargo on arms imports for the Muslims, Kontic said that a 
short-term cease-fire, as well as the decision on lifting the 
embargo, are encouraging Muslims to persist in the war option. 
He added that some of President Clinton's statements that the 
arms embargo will not be lifted were encouraging. 
  Asked about the army and police allegedly stepping up their 
activities in Raska, about which the Muslim National Council of 
Sandzak has informed foreign journalists, Kontic said that this 
was not true and that such claims are spread in order to exert 
pressure on Serbia, primarily from abroad. He added that he had 
given instructions for an investigation to be carried out.

<F P=106> [Interview with Nikola Sainovic, Federal Republic of </F>
Yugoslavia deputy prime minister, by Dusko Petrovic; place and 
date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Studio announcer] The decreasing of public 
expenditure and primarily the decreasing of the deficit in the 
federal and republican budgets is an extremely important task. 
The further successful realization of the program of monetary 
reconstruction and the country's economic recovery greatly 
depends on it. It is well-known that the Serbian Government has 
already undertaken concrete measures and activities in order to 
further decrease the deficit in the republic's coffers and to 
ensure that it is reimbursed only from real sources. What the 
Federal Government plans to do in this respect is the question 
that DNEVNIK put to Deputy Premier Nikola Sainovic. 
  [Sainovic] We knew from the start that this was going to be 
a difficult and very responsible task, but we planned in the 
program to accomplish within six months something that this 
state could not accomplish for years and that is to annul the 
budget deficit. The results accomplished so far prove that this 
task can be accomplished. The National Bank has already lent 
both the republican and federal budgets less than was planned in 
the program, and as things stand now, I am convinced that we are 
going to accomplish this task regardless of all the difficulties 
that accompany it. 
  In the same way that the economy -- in conditions of a real 
economy -- is expected to produce, market, and live only on the 
results of its work, the federation and the republics must get 
along on the funds available, and we are going to accomplish 
this. 
  [Petrovic] This assumes the ongoing financing of the federal 
state and the federal units from real sources. Will the federal 
state in July or August perhaps convert to borrowing money on 
the money market and other sources? 
  [Sainovic] The basic thing is that in the second half of the 
year, we are going to convert to financing only from real 
sources, and the state should ideally finance itself from its 
primary sources. Since it is not possible to decrease the 
deficit solely by saving -- all the existing consumers cutting 
expenses, monitoring every penny, and so forth -- the Federal 
Government will initiate the implementation of a concept of 
reorganization of the federal administration, which will be a 
program that we have never had so far, not since the founding of 
this federal state. 
  [Petrovic] Deputy Prime Minister, we can soon expect to see 
a more efficient and modern federal state, more appropriate to 
the conditions we are living under, the needs of the economy and 
the citizens? 
  [Sainovic] On the basis of the concept that has been 
prepared, we are going to implement such a reorganization of the 
federal administration that it will be possible to precisely 
pinpoint the responsibility of each ministry or an individual 
part of it; there will be no great number of organizational 
units in which responsibility and efficiency will be lost; there 
will be fewer employees, the entire administration will fit into 
one building -- the palace of the Federal Executive Council, and 
I am convinced that this will represent the federal 
administration's significant contribution to the program's 
realization. 
  [Petrovic] Thank you very much. 
  [Sainovic] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Jovan Dulovic: "At the Center of Hell"] </F>
  [Text] Dusan Vuckovic (age 30), known as Repic, from Umka 
near Belgrade, is charged in an indictment with having killed 16 
and wounded 20 innocent Muslim civilians from the village Divic 
when he was a member of the notorious Yellow Ants volunteer 
unit, and with having raped a 35-year-old Muslim woman in Mali 
Zvornik (SR [Socialist Republic] Serbia) from whom he then took 
1,000 German marks. His elder brother Vojin Vuckovic (age 31), 
better known by his nickname Zuca, commander of the Yellow Ants, 
is charged with unauthorized possession of a sizable quantity of 
weapons and has been released on bail pending trial. 
  All the details in the indictment have not yet been made 
public, but it is known that during the investigation the 
brothers were suspected of having released bloodthirsty pit bull 
terriers to attack imprisoned civilians and of organizing 
nighttime duels, that is, compelled the Muslims to fight each 
other to the death with knives. The winner was promised freedom. 
It is not known whether the investigation was able to support 
those suspicions with evidence or witness testimony. Branko 
Njegovan, district public prosecutor, says that on 27 or 28 June 
1992 Dusan Vuckovic cut off the ear of a prisoner in the culture 
center in the village of Celopek, where inhabitants of the 
village Divic had been imprisoned. (This was a commonplace 
gesture in units made up of convicts released from prison to 
fight on battlefields in Bosnia. They would prove their 
accomplishment in ethnic cleansing with the ears they had cut 
off, and this was closely bound up with reduction of their 
sentences.) Then he fired an entire burst (of 30 rounds) from a 
Kalashnikov into civilians. 
  Dusan Vuckovic has reportedly confessed to having killed 
seven people. In a trial of volunteers from some paramilitary 
unit (which one has not been announced) the other day in the 
same court, Andjelko Trninic (age 27), a machine technician from 
Klupci near Loznica, and his contemporary Dragomir Zekic, an 
electrician from the vicinity of Zvornik, the prosecutor says, 
murdered Milenko Vidovic, a physician from Mali Zvornik, in a 
perfidious way on 16 July 1992. What is special about that crime 
is the motive and the manner in which it was committed. Arrested 
exactly a year ago, during the entire time of criminal 
proceedings and the trial Andjelko Trninic was categorical: "I 
cut the doctor's throat on patriotic grounds." Trninic actually 
is not defending himself, he is not contrite. He speaks of the 
crime as though he expects recognition for patriotic service. 
  Andjelko Trninic's explanation delivered to the court is 
interesting: "We heard that Dr. Vidovic was smuggling drugs and 
medical supplies, and so Zekic and I went to check it out. When 
we had drunk the drink the doctor offered, I pulled out a pistol 
and ordered him to show us everything that he had there in the 
house. There was a sizable quantity of drugs piled on the sofa, 
shelves, and in bureaus. The doctor's justification was that the 
drugs were needed for the patients he treats privately. It was 
clear to me that Vidovic was a traitor to the Serbian people," 
Trninic concluded. Dragomir Zekic described the act of execution 
in more detail: "Trninic then went into the bathroom with 
Vidovic, and on the basis of what I heard, I concluded that they 
were still talking about the drugs. Some 10 minutes later he 
asked me to bring him the knife from the kitchen. I thought he 
needed it to open some box or to frighten Vidovic. Then Trninic 
ordered the doctor to kneel down beside the bathtub...." They 
put Milenko Vidovic with his throat slit into the bathtub and 
took an automatic rifle and pistol from the apartment. Trninic 
says that he received the order to execute the doctor from his 
command, which was stationed at that time in Zvornik. Expert 
witnesses concluded that Andjelko Trninic was at the time he 
committed [text missing from original]. 
<H5>  From White to Yellow </H5>
  All the things that happened along the left bank of the 
Drina 
beginning in early spring 1992 have largely remained unknown to 
the public. In Mali Zvornik, the very first glance made it clear 
at that time that something strange was happening in Zvornik; on 
the Serbian side, the bridges were blocked with sandbags, on 
which were machine guns with loaded belts, aimed at the other 
bank of the Drina, where a big sign said "Srpska republic of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina" to mark the border. In addition to the 
weapons, uniformed police, members of the military police, men 
in camouflage uniforms without insignia, and several civilians 
whom all addressed with deference (the republic MUP [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs]) were also keeping a close eye on what 
happened on the other side. "You do not know, my friend, what 
kind of riffraff had collected in Zvornik. Offspring of an evil 
father and a mother who was worse. Better not to go there unless 
you had to," suggested the border guards on the bridge whom we 
mentioned, also remarking that "twice the looters from Zvornik 
have attacked the bridge with weapons in an attempt to carry 
away booty and arms into Serbia." 
  Zvornik was at that time crowded with various armed 
groupings: the White Eagles, the Dragon's People (they referred 
to their leader as the Dragon), the Yellow Ants, the Yellow 
Jackets, Cele's Volunteers, Peja's Guards, unidentified little 
groups that called themselves "special units," various 
detachments for special purposes.... They all looked askance at 
one another with weapons in their hands and a bullet in the 
chamber. "A quiet war is being waged here for power, and the 
situation is very tense," explained the Zvornik TO [Territorial 
Defense] commander, who introduced himself as Marko, although 
the chiefs of certain units close to the authorities in Belgrade 
said that this was a certain Branko Popovic, Mihalj Kertes' man, 
who had done a great deal in bringing down the advocates of 
autonomy in Vojvodina. From what Marko said, as soon as an armed 
group would burst into the city, it would immediately try to 
take power, that is, to disarm Marko and the TO forces, and then 
to confront the menacing rival armed groups which were also 
laying claim to power, and the attempt would fail. Marko was 
surviving as commander without any authority or the strength to 
restore order. 
  A few km from Zvornik, in a restaurant named "The Four 
Teats" 
(owned by two sisters), the leader of one of the most numerous 
groups (it is not wise to mention the names even today) openly 
said that he had come to Zvornik as a Serbian patriot above 
political parties to use his men to purge the Serbian land of 
Muslims, justifying the necessity for ethnic cleansing with the 
words of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, 
that "the Serbs no longer have any reason whatsoever to beg the 
Muslims to live together in the same state." Judging, however, 
by the great number of gold chains around his neck, mostly 
women's, and the rings on his fingers, one got the impression 
that for the members of the paramilitary units killing Muslims 
was only a cover for looting. "Tonight, we did our work in the 
nearby Muslim village with cold steel, we did not fire a round," 
the volunteers would relate in the restaurant, slapping the 
knives decorated with cockades that hung from their belts. 
Psychiatrists would have said of many of them that they are 
personally unhappy and mentally poisoned and corrupted people 
who are able to nurture this kind of aggressiveness thanks to a 
corrupted environment. 
  The Ants of Zuca (Vojin Vuckovic) were spoken of in eastern 
Bosnia as one of the most cruel units. "They left nothing alive 
behind," members of other quite similar paramilitary units would 
remark respectfully. The other day, there was a newspaper 
article (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 13 May) that said that "the Yellow 
Ants have done much evil in Bosnia, and in early August 1992 the 
special forces from Pale managed to disarm and arrest them." 
This is what kids would call baloney. The allegedly arrested 
Ants were even shown on TV. However, that same evening the 
arrestees and the special forces celebrated their successful 
farce in the restaurant near Zvornik we have mentioned; its 
purpose was obviously to deceive the public. It was supposed to 
be interpreted in terms of the law-governed state in Pale 
effectively removing the criminals and looters from its 
territory. 
<H5>  Torching of Villages </H5>
  Up to the end of August 1992 there were so many 
problematical 
people armed to the teeth in Zvornik and environs that there was 
no force to disarm them and drive them out of a city overwhelmed 
by lawlessness. Anyone could do what he wanted to, loot or kill, 
without fear of being subject to criminal prosecution or pursuit 
of any kind, in spite of the assertion of the TO commander that 
"all the institutions of the temporary government, such as the 
prosecutor's office and the court, were in operation," which was 
absurd anyway because no one even dared to look crossways at the 
members of the "liberation units." The desire to drive the bands 
out of Zvornik remained in the domain of wishes. "We have 
problems with several armed groups," newsmen were told at the 
time by Marko, "but we do not know to whom they belong. We have 
contacted Bogdanovic (Serbian minister of police at that time) 
and Seselj. They answered that they could not help, because 
those groups had gotten away from them. Today, for example, 
Azdaja and his people burst into the offices of the TO and 
threatened to kill us at gunpoint if we continued to insist that 
the paramilitary forces leave the city." The commander of the 
most numerous group, who always appeared accompanied by two glum 
TO soldiers, had an explanation as to why there was a conflict 
with members of the TO. "It seems that Mr. Marko sent the 
military police to disarm the volunteers. But because the 
volunteers are better fighters, they disarmed the police. We can 
expect all this to work out when the gentleman politicians 
finally realize that war is not waged in armchairs, but with a 
gun in your hand. I think that this new communist movement is 
behind these splits," the commander said. It can hardly be said 
that those "robber bands," as the police in Mali Zvornik refer 
to them, were waging war in eastern Bosnia. This was actually 
heedless murdering and looting. 
  On 10 May 1992, Muslim houses burned in Skelani and in the 
nearby villages Mihaljevici, Redzici, Lonjin, Krasanpolje, 
Rzine, Dzafici, Osamsko.... "I wanted to see it burn. The owner 
and his family had fled, because this restaurant was a meeting 
place of the Green Berets under command of Ahmet Tihic," said a 
TO member with glowing eyes who poured gasoline on Bekim Fehic's 
restaurant at the entrance to Skelani. A bulldozer then razed 
the torched Muslim houses. The explanation for the burnings, 
except for the desire we have mentioned, was rather 
unconvincing. Allegedly, the Muslims never returned to the 
burned-out ruins of their houses. 
  "Never before have there been so many vultures circling in 
the sky along the course of the Drina," observed local people in 
the Serbian villages on the right bank of the river. They stood 
and watched the torched Muslim houses burning on the other side 
of the river, accompanied by the sporadic fire of automatic 
rifles. It was clear to everyone that ethnic cleansing was 
taking place. "Evil will come from all this. One day the Muslims 
will return and take revenge," an old man expressed his 
suspicion out loud, while the others kept silent. No one was 
gladdened by the burning of the houses of those who had been 
neighbors until the day before. 
  The old man's prediction came true after a few months: The 
Muslims returned to some mixed and Serbian villages and took 
revenge in kind. They torched the Serbian houses and murdered 
the Serbian inhabitants. Even by that time there were hardly any 
volunteers from Serbia in eastern Bosnia. Most of them had fled 
to Serbia, carrying away the booty they had looted and their 
weapons. 
<H5>  The Sanctions, and so Forth </H5>
  The outcome of the trial of Dusan Vuckovic, the first Serb 
accused of war crimes, is uncertain, and at this point it is 
difficult to judge whether criminal prosecution of criminals 
will ensue on a larger scale. Especially because the 
international court for war crimes committed on the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia will not recognize the decisions of the 
national courts. As Antonio Cassese, presiding judge of the 
international court, said in the most recent May issue of the 
Italian magazine COOPERATIONE, "a number of effective measures 
to deter them from that kind of behavior has been envisaged 
against those countries which refuse to extradite suspected war 
criminals and thereby withhold cooperation from the court. One 
such measure might be imposing sanctions of the Security 
Council." Because we are already under sanctions, there seems 
nothing for us to do but to see what those "other measures" are.

<F P=106> [Report by M.B.L.: "Nuclear Waste Hidden in Kalna"] </F>
  [Text] Bor -- Dr. Jovan Aleksic, minister of ecology in 
the Serbian Government, on Bor Lake yesterday announced a 
long-concealed truth that nuclear waste from the Vinca Institute 
was hidden in the tunnels of a long-abandoned uranium mine in 
Kalna near Knjazevac. 
  "We have followed the lead of a question raised by an 
assembly deputy and discovered that there really was nuclear 
waste deposited in barrels in the tunnels of the abandoned 
uranium mine in Kalna," Dr. Jovan Aleksic said to reporters at a 
news conference. His findings indicate that the waste 
originates from the Vinca Institute, however, a question remains 
whether it was the experts at this institute who did this or 
some other institution that did not know what to do with the 
radioactive waste. 
  In any case the waste will be returned to its true owner and 
residents in the vicinity of Kalna will again be able to graze 
their cattle on the nearby clearings. Dr. Aleksic was resolute 
in his conclusion that the problem of depositing nuclear, 
industrial, and any type of waste must be resolved expertly and 
with considerably less harmful consequences for the human 
environment. 
  A question remains as to who will attest to the great 
damages 
suffered by residents of Kalna, Mezdrej, Gabrovica, and other 
nearby villages.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Serbian Radical Party of </F>
Montenegro -- `Real Leaders of the Serbian People Think 
Differently'"] 
  [Text] "We harshly condemn the unmeasured statement by FRY 
President Lilic. It is clear to everybody who has read the text 
that the leader mentioned there must be in the Srpska republic 
as it is at war," it is said in the statement by the Serbian 
Radical Party of Montenegro. 
  ``Is it possible that the Yugoslav president does not know 
the reasons for the war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
reasons for not ending the war and for not establishing peace? 
He clumsily expressed his annoyance, as well as the annoyance 
of millions of Yugoslavs, with the fact that the civil war in 
Bosnia, because of which people are still being killed and 
suffering, is still going on. 
  ``When it is known what the world wants from the Serbs in 
general and particularly from those in the Srpska republic, it 
is particularly inappropriate that the head of the Yugoslav 
federation directly accuses heroic Serbian leaders, saying that 
the war continues due their leadership ambitions. An insult to 
them is also an insult to the suffering and decimated people of 
the Srpska republic. 
  "Serbian leaders can immediately decide to end the war, 
albeit to do so means accepting the blackmail and giving 
Bosnia-Herzegovina over to Alija Izetbegovic. The sanctions on 
Yugoslavia would then be lifted, but the Serbian people would 
also end the centuries-old dream of a joint state, which has 
already been created. However, the Serbian people would also be 
left without respect and dignity, and the future generations of 
Serbs would be ashamed of our generation for deciding on a road 
of humiliation out of selfishness. We hope that this was only a 
momentary weakness of Mr. Lilic's and that the real leaders of 
the Serbian people think differently," the Montenegrin Radicals 
point out.

<F P=106> [Report by Miodrag Vukadinovic from Knin] </F>
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Vukadinovic] The creation of a 
unified Serbian country, based on the ideas of democracy and 
social justice, is the basic program goal of the Serbian Party 
of Socialists, it was stated at the first electoral conference 
of this party, held in Knin. Party president Djordje Bjegovic 
said in his introduction that the economic and cultural 
reconstruction of the country parallel to the reduction of 
political tensions is the principle upon which Serbian 
Socialists will insist in their future political activities: 
  [Bjegovic] I believe that here I share the belief of all the 
citizens of the world, namely, that peace is a prerequisite in 
order to be able to live life. The Serbian Party of Socialists 
believes that peace can only be created through negotiations, 
cease-fire, agreements. Afterward, the issue of borders should 
be resolved with economic programs [sentence as heard]. 
  [Vukadinovic] Hailing the work of the electoral conference 
in the name of a numerous delegation of the Socialist Party of 
Serbia, Federal Human Rights Minister Margit Savovic said: 
  [Savovic] You all know very well that Serbia has done 
everything that you could stress in the world as an equal in the 
negotiations with Croatia, that it is supporting and aiding 
these people here in all aspects, and above all wants you to 
accomplish you desires and tendencies, wishes to accompany you 
in it and work on it together with you. The entire struggle that 
you are engaged in must result in life in one state. 
  [Vukadinovic] In the name of the SPS of the Serbian 
Republic, all present were greeted by party president Dr. 
Dragutin Ilic, who voiced the belief this party's program will 
very quickly gain popularity in the Serbian Republic: 
  [Ilic] We favor a single, unified Serbian state, and not 
little states or perhaps duchies, but a state that will have one 
parliament, one government, one president. 
  [Vukadinovic] By forming the communal committee, the first 
electoral conference of the Serbian Party of Socialists for the 
Knin commune has ended its work. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Miljenko Filipovic, commander of the </F>
Zrinski Regiment, by Snjezana Dukic; place and date not given: 
"If We Had Been Only 10 Minutes Late..."] 
  [Text] "The Zrinski Regiment has up to now been the best 
and most elite unit of the Croatian Army [HV] in its 
organization, its work, its structure, and its results. It is 
the only unit of all the so-called special forces at the 
beginning of the war which has survived to this day and has good 
results. All the rest have fallen apart. We do not live on 
memories like some people. Our performance results are almost 
the same in 1991 and 1993," says Colonel Miljenko Filipovic, 
commander of the Zrinski Regiment, a special unit of the Defense 
Ministry, which celebrated its third anniversary the other day. 
  A resident of Zagreb who was born in Tomislavgrad, a soldier 
in the Foreign Legion since 1984, his career is typical for 
legionnaires. On the wall of the Zrinski Regiment Command in 
Rakitje, there are several certificates of a parachutist, a 
diver, a commando leader, an instructor in hand-to-hand 
combat.... He has waged war throughout Africa from Djibouti, 
Chad, and Zaire to Rwanda as a member of an elite platoon of 
paratroops in the Legion. Motivated by events in Croatia, after 
arriving from the field in Africa in late 1990, he decided to 
leave the Foreign Legion. Although he still had two years of 
service to go under his contract in the Legion, working out 
cancellation of the contract through regular procedure was out 
of the question. 
  [Filipovic] I could no longer wait. At that time, there was 
a 
crisis in the Gulf between Iraq and Kuwait and I knew that I 
would be sent there, and that would have meant at least a year 
of warfare. Through my brother, I managed to obtain a passport 
and returned after seven years of being out of Croatia, and I 
left the Legion once and for all. 
<H5>  Fine Lads </H5>
  [Dukic] At the beginning of the homeland war you trained 
members of the Antiterrorist Unit [ATJ] in Lucko. You passed on 
to them some of the knowledge and military skills from the 
Legion? 
  [Filipovic] Yes, I was an instructor in Lucko, but that was 
the police, and I am a professional soldier. There are big 
differences between the army and the police, and I was bothered 
most by the poor organization. To be sure, there were fine lads 
there, but they were unaccustomed to waging war and to the 
rigorous discipline that we had in the Legion. You do not become 
a professional soldier overnight. It takes at least five years 
for a soldier to go through training, to learn terrains, to 
learn tactics, to become resourceful, to get a taste of war. It 
takes more than pluck and bravery to wage war. You need 
equipment, good weapons, which at that time we did not have, and 
we were up against a well-equipped aggressor. We got our 
bearings and acquired weapons however we could. In actuality, 
the police were smuggling weapons in their own state. It sounds 
very funny, but at the time that is how it was. The Lucko ATJ 
was in those early days the unit principally responsible for all 
actions. Those boys were ready for anything, and as soon as they 
got a rifle in their hands they thought that they had everything 
and could do everything. They would say: "Man, what can tanks do 
to us...," and if tanks had come upon us at that moment they 
would have run over us all. Now the Croatian Army is slowly 
coming into its own. There will still be a great deal of work on 
its structure, but now we have both weapons and materiel, and 
the situation is no longer what it was in 1990. 
  [Dukic] When you transferred from the Lucko ATJ to the 
Defense Ministry, you and Colonel General Ante Rosa were given 
the task of forming the Zrinski Regiment. What did that look 
like at the beginning? 
  [Filipovic] The regiment was formed on 18 May 1991 by order 
of Gojko Susak, who at that time was deputy defense minister. On 
the actual day it was created, we had 27 volunteers who had been 
picked from among the 300 members of the MUP [Ministry of 
Internal Affairs] at the training center in Kumrovec. They were 
enrolled through a strict selection procedure and subject to 
certain criteria, and that meant that they could not be over age 
25, they had to have good psychophysical stability and 
conditioning, they had to be without family obligations, young 
men ready for anything.... 
<H5>  From Battle to Battle </H5>
  [Dukic] After General Rosa left for his new post in the 
Defense Ministry in the summer of 1991, you took over the place 
of regimental commander. What were your first actions? 
  [Filipovic] As early as mid-June 1991, we went to our first 
deployment in Vukovar, where our main task was to help in 
organizing and training the Vukovar volunteers, and we assisted 
Gen. Blago Zadra in a successful action to mop up Borovo 
Naselje. Then came Hrvatska Kostajnica, which we took back with 
one section of the 1st Guard Brigade. After that, the entire 
unit went to Gospic, where in a lightning action on 5 September 
we captured a convoy of armored vehicles of the former JNA 
[Yugoslav People's Army] with 30 crew members, led by Gen. 
Krstevski. I received an order from Zagreb to let them all go 
home, but the "armor" remained in our hands. Then we took the 
Kaniza military warehouse, which we literally emptied in a 
single night. That meant a turning point in Gospic. The men were 
armed, and other garrisons in the vicinity were also falling. 
Toward the end of October, the regiment went to Metkovic with 
the task of helping in military operations in the liberation of 
Slano. In those actions, we took the most important elevation 
above Slano--Timor hill. In Operation Maslenica, the Zrinski 
Regiment played one of the more significant roles. Twice we 
conquered Skabrnja, we liberated the area from Smokovici to 
Murvica, we broke out onto the main highway, and we also rescued 
Novigrad from a new breakthrough of the chetnik forces. Had we 
been 10 minutes later that time, Novigrad would have fallen. We 
took part in the liberation of Dubrovnik. We were the first to 
take Golubov Kamen, but we had to withdraw because of poor 
coordination with our other units. 
<H5>  Held Back by Politics </H5>
  [Dukic] So far, you have mainly talked about the more 
important actions. However, the Zrinski Regiment did much more 
than that, and some of your members even took part in battles on 
the territory of Herceg-Bosna. 
  [Filipovic] Yes, toward the end of 1991 we were training 
soldiers in Tomislavgrad. We took part in the battles on Kupres, 
which I commanded personally. The regiment liberated 
three-fourths of Kupres, but in the end it fell nevertheless, 
through no fault of ours. 
  [Dukic] Whose fault was it that Kupres fell, and how did you 
come to be a soldier of the Croatian Army in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina anyway? 
  [Filipovic] I know whose fault it was, but I do not want to 
talk about that now. Nevertheless, this was the beginning of the 
war in Herceg-Bosna, the army was not organized, the people were 
not ready. We had no one to rely on, and we were not able to 
carry all the burden ourselves. This is where we had our first 
men killed, and I myself was wounded. After it fell, we remained 
for a time in Herzegovina, helping to build the Croatian Defense 
Council [HVO]. 
  You see, I was born in Tomislavgrad, and I was fighting in 
Herceg-Bosna as a volunteer. I cannot leave the graves of my 
ancestors to anyone. Absolutely not! Incidentally, when war 
broke out in Croatia, most of the volunteers came from 
Herzegovina, and they only went back to defend their own. 
  [Dukic] To what extent did political decisions and the 
signing of cease-fire agreements make the situation more 
difficult in the field? 
  [Filipovic] I am not interested in changes of policy, 
because 
I am above all a professional soldier. I am here to defend my 
homeland, my people, to respect its will. Few people in the 
world recognized Croatia in 1990 and 1991. It did not suit 
anyone for the former Yugoslavia to fall apart, and it is 
natural that it should have been extremely difficult for our 
politicians. But it must also be clear that politics was always 
holding us, the army, back. The Croatian Army is now 
sufficiently strong and well enough armed to take back all its 
borders. Let our politicians continue to go on solving 
everything by peaceful means, but if that is not possible, we 
are available. 
<H5>  A Great Deal of Experience </H5>
  [Dukic] What in your opinion is the key factor in building 
the Croatian Army? 
  [Filipovic] The Croatian Army will be among the best so long 
as the command positions are held by those who went through the 
entire homeland war waging war, who will be able to contribute 
thanks to their experience. We may also graduate from military 
schools at the university level and academies, but there is no 
substitute for practical experience.... The homeland war 
represents a great deal of experience of life and military 
experience, an important school. This cannot be learned 
anywhere, but only in war, out in the field! 
  [Dukic] What lies ahead for the Zrinski Regiment? 
  [Filipovic] In the new structure of the Croatian Army, the 
Zrinski Regiment will be part of the 1st Croatian Guard Corps, 
but we will continue to be a combat unit with special 
importance. The training of our members is being conducted from 
sunup to sundown. The requirements include conditioning drills, 
martial arts, parachute jumps, diver training, exercises in 
military tactics, and the recognition and handling of all types 
of weapons. There is not a moment's pause in all this. We are 
constantly learning, drilling, improving ourselves to be as 
good, strong, and ready as we can to protect Croatia and the 
Croatian people.

<F P=106> [Text of interview with Mirko Galic, director of Croatian </F>
Radio-Television, by Boris Komadina; place and date not given: 
"Television Is No Cathedral"] 
  [Text] Mirko Galic's appointment as the new director of HRT 
[Croatian Radio-TV], following the initial hesitation, has 
evoked many comments, mainly favorable. Mirko Galic is one of 
the best-known journalists in Croatia, a former editor of DANAS, 
and until recently a correspondent of VECERNJI LIST and VJESNIK. 
Thanks to his reputation as a superb professional, many believe 
he will contribute to opening up government television and 
blunting the attack of numerous European institutions on 
Croatian TV [HTV]. 
  [Komadina] When did you first learn that you were being 
considered for director of HRT? 
  [Galic] My name had been "in the pot" for some time, both 
for 
that and for certain other positions, which neither excited me 
nor interested me all that much. I am happiest when I can do my 
job as a journalist in peace, at present my job as a 
correspondent, unburdened by any kind of intrigues, especially 
those involving me and about me that are created by others 
without my knowledge. There have been such cases. They had me 
moved over to television before it was a serious consideration. 
And it became serious in the last two or three months, precisely 
since the Washington agreement. That is when the proposal was 
made to me, for the first time in Washington as a matter of 
fact, that I should help to create the kind of television 
Croatia needs. I did not accept at first, you can well imagine, 
because I am not sure I can do that, nor to what extent I will 
have the proper conditions. I examined myself, but also the 
circumstances, before I decided to accept. 
  [Komadina] To whom did you talk, and what reasons decided 
you 
in favor of accepting that post? 
  [Galic] I talked with those people with whom I had to talk 
about a decision like that. I did not manage to talk to everyone 
I wanted to, because some were away from Zagreb at the time. It 
seems to me that we agreed on what was most important for 
me--that my job has to do with the programming, not the 
technology or the finances of Croatian Television. That is all I 
would know about anyway: I have been a journalist for 25 years, 
I have gained some experience, I have certain ideas, I still 
have some determination and energy. The rest is not up to me. 
  [Komadina] Is it true, as we have heard, that you talked 
twice to President Tudjman, who accepted your condition for 
precise delimitation of powers at HRT? 
  [Galic] There is no secret or mystery about those to whom I 
talked. I do not see what the problem is. I did not arrange 
conferences with those people after every meeting. With Mr. 
Tudjman, those were really working conversations, they were 
really frank and open, exclusively about those conditions under 
which I would go to work in television. I received the 
guarantees I requested; they still need to be elaborated so that 
there are no misunderstandings. I have always believed that 
preparations are half of the job; that is why I endeavored to 
such an extent to have my rights and also my obligations and 
responsibilities defined. That part of the agreement is still 
not finished. There is time yet, the government has (only) 
appointed me, I still have not taken up my duties as director. 
  [Komadina] From the French perspective, how do you see the 
continual and clear accusations of the work of HRTV by European 
parliamentarians? 
  [Galic] Television is what is most visible in any country; 
it 
is a screen presented to the world. We should be aware that 
Croatia will be judged for a long time on the basis of its 
television. France can afford a television that ruins the 
picture of a democratic country; in one study, it was in only 
25th place in the ranking of the freedom of the media (Belgium 
is first), and that is because of its television, which is more 
under commercial than political pressure. Croatia cannot afford 
that, first, because it needs an open and democratic television 
in order to develop a democratic culture and the culture of 
democratic thinking, and second, because television represents a 
part of its European test. The Council of Europe, as the first 
step, and the European Parliament, as the second, require a 
candidate to guarantee an independent and pluralistic 
television. If everything goes well, toward the end of this year 
Croatia could cross the first European threshold in Strasbourg. 
But when delegations of the Council of Europe come to Zagreb 
soon, I can imagine with quite a bit of confidence what they 
will ask: How does television express the pluralism of political 
life? How does the state exercise its influence on television 
(and more broadly on the media)? 
  [Komadina] As future director of HRT, what is your comment 
on 
the fact that Croatia is one of the rare countries (if not the 
only one) in which legal private television stations do not 
exist? 
  [Galic] I personally am an advocate of private television, I 
had taken that position in a study done a year ago, when my 
coming to HTV was discussed for the first time. Public 
television--I like that name more than the name government 
television--is still the backbone of public information; private 
television should furnish elements of competition and dynamism. 
But the conditions should be clearly defined for them both, so 
that we know what standards and quality have to be met, what are 
the relations between the domestic and foreign programming, what 
are obligations concerning the news, and so on. It has seemed to 
me, and it still does, that Croatia ought to have two public 
channels, the first more on the serious side and the second more 
on the entertainment side, one private national channel and 
several regional private television stations. Meanwhile, we 
ought to define the standards and the code, appoint a special 
independent council (the present one is too cumbersome) that 
would monitor how television, both public and private, is 
respecting its basic obligations as to objectivity, pluralism, 
and the distribution in programming. 
  [Komadina] Do you think that HRT must be a "cathedral of the 
Croatian spirit"? 
  [Galic] Croatia has its cathedrals, they should be given 
freedom to do what belongs to them. But let television be 
television. If you really want my slogan, I would say that it 
should be Croatian, democratic, and European. Incidentally, that 
is what I said in all my conversations. 
  [Komadina] What is your comment on Mr. Vrdoljak's statement 
that you never would have been heard of, that you would have 
been anonymous, if it had not been for television? 
  [Galic] Many have called my attention to that statement, 
some 
have asked me to react. As though it were offensive. I laughed 
when I read it. I do not know what else Mr. Vrdoljak said, maybe 
that statement sounds different in context. But I do not intend 
to prove to him nor anyone else that I am not an anonymous 
journalist and that I did exist even before television. It is 
true that television expands the borders of a journalist's (any 
journalist's) recognition, and that is exactly what I always 
wanted to avoid. With television, after all, one loses a portion 
of privacy. Vrdoljak's statement is probably an element of his 
style. As far as I am concerned, it will not affect 
collaboration. 
  [Komadina] Please comment on the charges which have been 
made 
that you are "a man for all times," which allude to your work on 
DANAS and in the socialist system in general. 
  [Galic] I heard that question once before, and my answer was 
the same as I make to you: Regimes come and go, the journalists 
remain! If, of course, they are professionals, if they are not 
too close to the regime, if they are not "regime journalists." 
What would it be like if the corps of journalists changed with 
every change? You are right if you are thinking that 1990 was 
not an ordinary change, because that was the beginning of the 
time of democracy, which contrasted with and followed the period 
of one-party government, that is, totalitarianism. But can 
democracy remove people, professional journalists? Especially 
those who in the period of one-dimensional thinking displayed 
courage in expressing other and different thoughts, even 
opposite thoughts. I am not certain that in citing DANAS you 
have chosen a good example: That publication, while I headed it 
(I am not talking about what it was before or afterward), was 
ahead of the times, precisely because it was disseminating a 
certain pluralism, because it was developing free criticism, 
because in the time of the "Croatian silence" it was defending 
certain threatened Croatian interests, from politics to 
language. It might seem to you today that that was not very 
much, but for that time, believe me, it was too much. My head 
was frequently on the block. 
  [Komadina] Many consider you the most successful editor in 
the recent history of Croatian journalism. Why did you leave 
DANAS just when it had reached its peak? 
  [Galic] I will let others speak to how successful or 
unsuccessful I have been. I will give you just two figures: When 
I took over the periodical, it had a printing of 43,000 (30,000 
sold), and when I left the printing was 110,000 (more than 
90,000 sold). I left because I was tired: It was not easy to run 
an editorial office that was markedly heterogeneous, to 
withstand the constant criticism from the Vjesnik establishment 
and the great threats from outside, which came even from the 
prosecutors. In 1988, the Journalists Society awarded me the 
annual prize for the editing of DANAS. The citation is worth 
reading today: The first sentence speaks about the good things I 
did, and the rest about mistakes, about failures. On the basis 
of that citation, I should have been punished, not rewarded. I 
knew the background: When some of the powers that be at that 
time heard that I had been given a prize, they made an uproar: 
How can you give an award to DANAS? Because the decision could 
not be changed, they changed the citation. I can say that most 
of the editorial staff was on my side, that within the 
establishment a certain stratification began into supporters and 
critics of DANAS, that there were allies and opponents even in 
Croatian politics.... But when I submitted my request to leave, 
no one said: Don't! Some were overjoyed. 
  [Komadina] How would you describe the situation in Croatian 
journalism at the moment? 
  [Galic] It is typical of the postcommunist period: There has 
been a stratification, everything is still at the halfway mark. 
If aggression against Croatia had not broken out, it all would 
probably have gone faster, from privatization of the media to 
definition of journalists. But even so, the changes are obvious, 
especially in the newspapers, which are moving over a broad 
front, from the papers that support the government and the 
incumbent party, and then papers which maintain a certain 
independence and nurture pluralism, to periodicals whose 
sympathies are oppositionist. That is democracy. One can only 
wish for it to go further and faster and for commercial 
interests not to smother serious journalism.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tesla in the Hands of Eriksson"] </F>
  [Text] After three months of negotiations among the Swedish 
telecommunications company Eriksson, the Croatian Government, 
and the Privatization Fund, the Fund's Board of Directors 
decided at a meeting to accept the Swedish firm's offer to buy 
Tesla. To meet the negotiated price of 70 million German marks 
[DM], the Swedes will pay DM20 million in cash, DM25 million in 
equipment, and hand over patent rights worth DM25 million. 
Eriksson's purchase of Tesla is considered one of the most 
important steps in the privatization process in Croatia in terms 
of the future of its employees rather than purely as a business 
deal. Over a five-year period the work force will be gradually 
reduced from 3,500 to 1,000, after the surplus employees have 
been retrained.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Pusic: "Victory Day: The Square of Victims </F>
and Their Rulers"] 
  [Text] In September 1990 the Assembly of the city of Zagreb 
made the decision to change the name of the Square of the 
Victims of Fascism to the Square of Croatian Rulers. All streets 
that lead to the square have been given the names of various 
medieval Croatian rulers. Thus, the part of Rudjer Boskovic 
Street that leads to the square in question was renamed King 
Drzislav Street. Even Mestrovic's pavilion, built immediately 
prior to the war (in 1990 it was not necessary to emphasize 
particularly which war was being referred to), and conceived as 
a lasting display of modern art, which at the time of the NDH 
[Independent State of Croatia] was converted into a mosque, and 
after the war into the Museum of the Revolution of the People of 
Croatia, must now become a pantheon-mausoleum for (future?) 
Croatian rulers. 
  When this decision of the City Assembly was announced, 
protests by citizens took place en masse and petitions were 
written, and on 22 September 1990 a large number of Zagreb 
residents gathered (on that day alone 2,371 people signed a 
petition of protest against changing the name) in front of 
Mestrovic's pavilion, encircling the whole pavilion with candles 
as a sign of remembrance of the victims of fascism and as a sign 
of protest against the decision to change the name of the square. 
  The mayor at that time, Boris Buzancic, informed the 
president of the republic about the dissatisfaction of part of 
the citizens with the decision to rename the Square of the 
Victims of Fascism, but the president was unyielding in his 
conviction of the need for the renaming. He gave up the idea of 
the pantheon and a version of the Square of Croatian rulers, but 
on the afternoon of 27 November 1990 the plates with the name 
Square of the Victims of Fascism were removed and replaced with 
new ones. In stealth, almost secretly, and, as Srdjan Dvornik 
will say in an appropriate article, "as if suitable for an 
unworthy act." It reminded many people of the removal of the 
monument to Ban Jelacic, with which another government 
"announced with the support of a plebescite that everything was 
starting anew with it." 
  Officially, it has been the Square of Croatian Greats since 
then; unofficially, the Square of the Victims of Fascism for 
many residents of Zagreb. 
  A Council for Action on the Square of Victims of Fascism has 
been founded, which writes petitions, gathers signatures, and 
organizes speaker's platforms, is issuing the booklet Square of 
Victims of Fascism in Zagreb. Among the numerous arguments as to 
why the name Square of the Victims of Fascism should be 
restored, the following are repeated: 
  --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of Zagreb 
antifascists who did that which was most worthy in the history 
of the people--oppose darkness and tyranny when the darkness 
seemed impenetrable and the tyranny undefeatable; 
  --that this name is a reminder of the thousands of citizens 
of Zagreb and citizens of Croatia, victims of fascism, who were 
not antifascist, only of another nation, another faith, or 
another race; 
  --that right on that square during the NDH, there were 
Ustashi and Gestapo prisons, through which thousands of victims 
of fascism passed; 
  --that countries of today's Europe, when they speak of the 
vision of a Europe of prosperity, do not call on their 
totalitarian, nation-building regimes from the past, but on the 
values that have always been the hope of the oppressed and those 
deprived of rights--freedom and the worth of the individual, the 
universality of human rights, and tolerance of differences. 
  The president of the Republic has answered all the arguments 
and petitions cited: "The restoration of the name Square of 
Victims of Fascism is sought by political dilettantes and 
exhibitionists." (VJESNIK, April 1991) 
  Since 9 May 1991, the Council for Action on the Square of 
the 
Victims of Fascism has organized each year, at 1800 hours, a 
gathering of citizens as a sign of observance of the Day of 
Europe-Day of Victory. 
  On that day the demand for the restoration of the name 
Square 
of the Victims of Fascism is always repeated. This name has 
become not only a symbol of arrogance and the devastation that 
the ruling group caused during the antifascist part of Croatian 
history, but also that narrow watershed that can determine if a 
country wishes to move toward an appropriate well-being for its 
citizens oriented to administrative organization, or ends in 
totalitarianism and repression. Naturally, the existence (or 
restoration) of the name Square of the Victims of Fascism is not 
a sure guarantee even of this, but for this reason a national 
government that removes names of streets and squares of victims 
of fascism, and puts up names of fascist war criminals, has 
oriented itself quite certainly to the trash heap of history. 
The way through Gospic, Pakracka Poljana, Ahmic, the Mostar 
stadium.... 
  Croatia has earned something quite a bit better than such 
nostalgic NDH people, who cannot restore the name Square of the 
Victims of Fascism, but who can, to the detriment and shame of 
Croatia, introduce the kuna as Croatian currency. The best that 
this government can do for Croatia is to lose democratically 
organized elections and withdraw, in a democracy of customary 
consequence. Restoration of the name Square of the Victims of 
Fascism is conditional on a change in the existing government. 
Or, as it could be said with a little optimism as a paraphrase 
of a famous sentence: "Next year on the Square of the Victims of 
Fascism!"

<F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Jerzy Jaskiernia, chairman of </F>
the Sejm Legislative Commission, by Henryk Sroczynski; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Sroczynski] The question of the president's 
powers is probably one of the most important, and at the same 
time most controversial, issues in the work on the new 
constitution.... 
  [Jaskiernia] Indeed, the question of the president's rights 
is a key issue and is certain to generate many arguments. 
Different functions are attached to the office of president in 
different systems. In a presidential system of the kind 
obtaining in the United States, the president discharges the 
function of head of the executive power--that is, he actually 
directs the government. On the other hand, in the 
parliamentary-cabinet system, the president is more a symbolic 
head of state. His function is to carry out certain ceremonial 
duties and grant top academic and other titles and highest 
military ranks; he is also the supreme commander of the armed 
forces. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] opts for the latter 
model. 
  [Sroczynski] What motivates the Left to make this choice? 
  [Jaskiernia] We postulate a weaker position for the 
president because we see the government and the prime minister 
as the principal carriers of the executive power. In our 
opinion, the public should know precisely who governs the 
country: the president or the prime minister. 
  [Sroczynski] Have we not known that hitherto? 
  [Jaskiernia] For the past few years, we have had a situation 
in Poland whereby the president could say that he was not able 
to realize his election campaign promises because he does not 
have sufficient powers as a result of the government's 
intervention. The government, in turn, claims that it cannot 
discharge its obligation to administer the country because the 
president interferes in various areas of its competence. 
  [Sroczynski] As a result, you are proposing to introduce a 
classical system of a combined parliament-cabinet rule, in which 
the president's function will be more symbolic than real. 
  [Jaskiernia] We adopt the classical configuration in which 
the president's function is weaker, but we also allow for a 
certain reinforcement of that function. First, we assume that 
the president will be elected by the whole of society in a 
general ballot. We have chosen that option, even though it is 
not strictly necessary with the president's current range of 
competence. Second, we allow for a more active role to be played 
by the president in a conflict situation--that is, at a time 
when we are unable to form a government. This should give him a 
chance to become a mediator. 
  [Sroczynski] Only in that kind of situation? 
  [Jaskiernia] I believe that, as soon as conflicts of that 
sort cease occurring, the president ought to withdraw into the 
wings and leave the stage to the government, giving it full 
freedom to act. Why should the president be an obstacle to the 
government's discharging its administrative duties? 
  [Sroczynski] Does Lech Walesa's personality not influence 
the left's decisions on which powers to give to the president? 
  [Jaskiernia] We are trying to draft a new constitution that 
is free from "personality conditioning." In other words, as we 
formulate the constitution, we leave out the question of Lech 
Walesa's personality. Furthermore, we have never discussed the 
president's range of competence with the aim of weakening his 
position. Anyone who watches the results of public-opinion 
polls will know that the ranking list is headed by SLD candidate 
Aleksander Kwasniewski. So it is not altogether certain who 
will be elected the next president. We believe that the public 
should have a clear-cut picture of who is responsible for the 
state administration. Personally, I am a firm opponent of a 
twofold, or diarchic, power structure. To apply soccer-derived 
vocabulary to such a structure, you can say that it is easiest 
to place the ball between the goalposts when there are two 
defense players. This situation of "splitting the defense" is 
most characteristic of a system where the president has a 
considerable range of competence, parallel, as it were, to the 
government's competences. In the FRG, there is no doubt that 
the chancellor is responsible for the state administration. In 
Britain, everyone knows that the prime minister runs the 
country's affairs, and no one expects the queen to do so. Why 
should we opt for a system that causes constant confusion about 
who is in charge? 
  [Sroczynski] Because the question of the range of 
competence of our top political figures and institutions 
generates such controversies and conflicts, is there not a 
danger that it will also delay the work on drafting the new 
constitution? 
  [Jaskiernia] If both sides show goodwill, the constitution 
could be promulgated in May or June of next year. The procedure 
approved by the Sejm for adopting a constitution is of a very 
democratic nature. Unfortunately, this creates the opportunity 
for delaying the work at every stage--and, if someone wished to 
do so for some malicious reason, he could well succeed. Such a 
boycott, based on exploiting various procedural loopholes, gaps, 
and opportunities, could cause a considerable delay in the work 
on the constitution and even lead to a situation whereby its 
promulgation by the present parliament is in question. 
  [Sroczynski] Is your vision not unduly pessimistic? 
  [Jaskiernia] Perhaps it is, but the possibility of such a 
situation cannot be precluded. 
  [Sroczynski] What other surprises do you think there could 
be? 
  [Jaskiernia] I also allow for the possibility of a certain 
paradoxical situation, which some people are already predicting. 
It is obvious that the president's representative on the 
Constitutional Commission will opt for a strong position for the 
president. In turn, the Center Accord [PC] will attempt to 
minimize the president's role in its own preferred version of 
the constitution. It is already clear that the division line 
will be quite complex. It is not only the left-wing orientation 
that opts for a weaker position for the president. 
Consequently, there is some speculation that, having realized 
that he has no reasonable chance of being elected within the 
framework of a strong presidential power system, Lech Walesa 
could still change his mind and pronounce himself in favor of 
the weaker presidential power option. 
  [Sroczynski] Do you mean that this could be the lesson we 
might yet learn from the outcome of the settlements reached 
during the roundtable talks? 
  [Jaskiernia] It may be that it will be necessary to abandon 
certain positions in order to avoid falling again into the trap 
into which Lech Walesa fell precisely during the roundtable 
negotiations. At that time, he was in favor of weak powers for 
the president because that office was then set aside for General 
Wojciech Jaruzelski. Later, after a short period of General 
Jaruzelski's presidency, he assumed that position himself, with 
its restricted powers, and immediately began to complain that 
his range of competence was too restricted. If he had taken a 
long-term view during the roundtable talks, he would have had no 
reason for complaint. On the other hand, we distance ourselves 
from making tactical, person-oriented moves, and, while we do 
not attempt to adjust the proposed presidential powers to the 
personality of any particular candidate, we nevertheless intend 
to build the state system according to logical and reasonable 
principles.

  [Text] The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has asked the 
Sejm Presidium to postpone the debate on the ratification of the 
concordat with the Vatican until after the new Constitution is 
adopted. The discussion has been planned for 2 July. In this 
situation, a vote will most probably be held during the nearest 
Sejm session in order to reschedule this date. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] To justify its motion, the SLD 
quotes the civil rights ombudsman who has written to the Sejm 
Speaker saying that the ratification of the concordat before the 
adoption of the new constitution will lead to discrepancies in 
the regulations defining the relations between the state and the 
church. In this situation, according to the SLD, the new 
constitution should be adopted first, and the concordat should 
be dealt with afterward. 
  [SLD Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski] "This is a better 
solution. It will avert the reservations that the concordat is 
arousing today, and it will give priority to the basic law, 
which the constitution is. At the same time, all of this may 
happen according to realistic deadlines. In not more than a 
year, we can have both the constitution and, later, a serious 
debate on the concordat. 
  We do not want either a religious or an ideological war. We 
simply want to dissuade doubts that the people in Poland have, 
and we need time to do this. I think this procedure will be 
better." 
  [Correspondent] The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] believes that 
the issue of the ratification should be dealt with as soon as 
possible, and it intends to vote against the proposal put 
forward by its partner in the coalition. 
  [Janusz Dobrosz, chairman of the PSL parliamentary floor 
group] "We are in favor of making a decision on the issue of the 
concordat by the Sejm. This is a democratic choice: Either we 
are for the ratification of the concordat, or we are against it. 
However, delaying the matter--and this is how the motion put 
forward by the SLD can be understood--will not benefit anything 
but will arouse emotions and result in other important issues 
being treated as secondary." 
  [Correspondent] The SLD's motion will most probably be 
supported by the Union of Labor. One can expect that, apart 
from the PSL, also the Confederation for an Independent Poland 
and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms, as well as an 
overwhelming majority of deputies from the Freedom Union, will 
vote against the postponement of the debate on the concordat. 
In the Sejm, the number of opponents of the concordat is almost 
equal to the number of its supporters. Thus, it is difficult to 
predict the outcome of the vote on the postponement of the 
debate.

  [Text] Warsaw, 11 Jun--The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
parliamentary floor group today submitted a motion to the Sejm 
Presidium for "postponing the first reading of the bill on the 
ratification of the concordat between the Holy See and the 
Polish Republic until after a new constitution of the Polish 
Republic comes into force," group Chairman Aleksander 
Kwasniewski told journalists. Earlier it was said at the Sejm 
that the debate on the concordat would be held on 2 July. 
  Kwasniewski said that this step was not directed against the 
church or the believers, and it was not aiming at stirring up a 
war over outlooks on life. He added that it intended to lead to 
the situation when the concordat "will be freed from public 
doubts, also expressed during the campaign before the 19 
September general election."

<F P=106> [Interview with Janusz Korwin-Mikke, chairman of Union for </F>
Real Politics, by correspondent Barbara Szczepula; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] [Szczepula] To begin with, let us talk about money. 
About our money. A few days ago, Minister Modzelewski announced 
his intention to increase the real estate tax to 10 percent.... 
  [Korwin-Mikke] That announcement was simply unbelievable. I 
even suspect that Minister Modzelewski did it to spite the 
government coalition and expose it to ridicule because, as we 
know, they want to dismiss him and have already given him his 
notice. Ten percent! No one imposes real estate taxes of such 
magnitude, not even an occupying force. It is a forced 
contribution levied on a nation, and a very high contribution at 
that. It is dreadful! 
  [Szczepula] Not everyone sees it in the same way. During a 
meeting at the "Zak" club, a young man pointed out to you that 
the proposed tax applies exclusively to tenement-house owners, 
and, because he did not own a tenement house, he was not at all 
affected by the thing. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] And I asked him: And where do you live? 
Under a bridge? Because, unless the youth in question lives 
under a bridge, the real estate tax will affect him as well. 
This is because the owner of the house where our hero lives 
will naturally include the costs of the tax in his tenants' 
rents. And that will happen regardless of whether the owner is 
an individual, a housing cooperative, or a local authority. You 
must understand the simple truth that that tax will not be paid 
by the wealthy tenement house owners, land owners, and so on. 
The tax will be paid by the consumer. It will be factored into 
the costs of bread, rent, shoes, and gasoline. And one other 
thing. I recall an exchange of correspondence with a reader 
resident in California, published a while ago by one of our 
weeklies. It concerned a referendum on lowering the real estate 
tax in California. Our inquisitive compatriot, who was a 
correspondent of the weekly in question, asked a 
none-too-affluent-looking local resident whether he had voted 
for or against the lowering of the real estate tax. "I voted for 
it," was the reply. "Do you yourself own any real estate?" our 
inquisitive reporter wanted to know. "I don't, but I could," 
was the reply. 
  [Szczepula] But, considering that it has not yet been 
decided when the tax in question should be imposed, we can still 
hope that we can last out until then. Just as in the story 
about the man sentenced to death by the sultan, who, in exchange 
for having the execution of the sentence postponed for a year, 
undertook to teach a monkey to speak. When asked how he 
proposed to make good his undertaking, he answered that he would 
worry about that later because, in the course of the year, the 
sultan could die--or the monkey or himself. Consequently, we 
can still cherish the hope that the sultan or the monkey will 
die before the new tax on real estate is brought into practice, 
and that we will outlive them. "Lower taxes" is the standard 
motto of your movement, but not all of your proposals have met 
with the same public approval. I am thinking here of the 
recommendation that the price of vodka be drastically lowered. 
People are rather shocked by such proposals. They reason as 
follows: "Cheaper vodka will be tantamount to more extensive 
alcoholism in society." 
  [Korwin-Mikke] That kind of reasoning is erroneous. Just as 
an increase in the price of vodka does not cut its consumption, 
so its decrease will not raise it at all. On the other hand, we 
should indeed examine the reasons that vodka is so expensive. 
It is 10 times more expensive than it should be. Well, it is 
because of the monopoly tax. Which is truly horrendous. 
  In any case, what is the result of the fact that the price 
of vodka is so high? Smugglers bring liquor to Poland 
illegally, while our own distilleries stand idle. This is 
because farmers are unable to sell their potatoes or rye grain. 
The industry suffers. The bureaucratic machine rakes in the 
money for the vodka. As a result, the poor families--because 
the families of alcoholics are always poor--suffer. If vodka 
were cheaper, perhaps our alcoholics would be able to put some 
money aside rather than spend it all on alcohol and, in this 
way, keep it for their wives and their children. Please note 
how many people profit from the organized smuggling of vodka to 
Poland. On the other hand, if we were to lower the price of 
alcohol, smugglers would take our vodka out of the country, and 
so the distilleries would profit and the farmers would 
profit.... In other words, a normal situation would prevail. 
  [Szczepula] You insist that taxes are the true measure of 
our freedom. The lower the taxes, the more freedoms available 
to the citizens. This kind of reasoning would suggest that the 
Swedes are the most captive nation in our world: After all, 
they pay as much as 80 percent of their incomes in taxes. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Precisely. The Swedes and the Poles. Seen 
from the inside, Sweden presents a horrific picture. 
  [Szczepula] What do you mean by this? For many of our 
compatriots, Sweden is the nearest equivalent to a paradise on 
earth. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Swedish society is a captive society. 
Something along the lines of Huxley's Brave New 
World. However, there is one fundamental difference 
between Sweden and Poland. Sweden is a wealthy country, having 
made its fortune by selling iron ore abroad during the two world 
wars. So it has enough money to be able to afford to lose some. 
On the other hand, we do not have the resources from which to 
finance socialism. 
  [Szczepula] The Union for Real Politics [UPR] wants to do 
away with socialism and introduce capitalism on a large scale, 
but the latest election showed that people do not want 
capitalism. After all, they voted for the left-wing orientation. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] But why did they do so? Because the people 
who ruled Poland recently were akin in their views to the U.S. 
Democrats. They claimed that they were building capitalism in 
Poland. But, in fact, they took as many loans as they could, 
they got rid of their Syrena cars and bought Volvos instead, and 
they kept on traveling toward socialism. Or, rather, 
Eurosocialism. So it was a ride in a larger and better vehicle, 
but it was still a ride in the wrong direction. Therefore, 
people got confused. In any case, after 45 years of life under 
real socialism, it is very difficult to accept the truth that 
there is no such thing as a free lunch. 
  [Szczepula] On the other hand, UPR proposes the introduction 
of capitalism, and people are afraid of that. For example, your 
plans to privatize all schools make people recoil in horror. 
Teachers are afraid that they will lose their jobs; parents are 
afraid that they will not be able to afford to pay for their 
children's educations. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] You are now citing a classical example of 
demagoguery promoted by the Polish Teachers Association. There 
will be smaller classes in private schools, which means that 
there will be a need for more teachers. 
  [Szczepula] But parents have their fears, too. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Statistically speaking, parents spend on 
average some 700,000 zlotys [Z] per child per month in a 
publicly owned school. This money is not paid directly to the 
school but is hidden in taxes: in gasoline, electricity, vodka, 
and so on. Out of that sum, about Z300,000-400,000 reach the 
school. The rest is swallowed by the bureaucratic machine. If 
parents could keep that sum of Z700,000--or even Z600,000--in 
their pockets, they would be able to pay Z500,000 in school fees 
and still have Z100,000 with which to buy, say, books for the 
child. At the same time, the school would still be getting much 
more money than it gets nowadays. At the moment, parents 
support huge crowds of officials from the Ministry of Education 
and local education authorities with the money they pay in 
taxes. In addition, that money is spent on supporting people 
who make controversial decisions about their children's 
educations contrary to the parents' wishes. 
  [Szczepula] Let us now talk about values and principles. 
The blue cross of St. George, which figures on your party's 
flag, is said to symbolize your fight for principles. What 
principles are these? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] St. George gave his energies to fight the 
dragon. The fact that in Polish the words "dragon" [smok] and 
"socialism" start with the same letter "s" is, of course, 
coincidental. As a symbol of our fight, St. George has one 
obvious advantage: According to the Vatican, he never existed 
at all. So no one will be able to accuse us of anticlericalism. 
The principles for which we fight are as follows: freedom, the 
right to own property, and justice. 
  [Szczepula] Do you mean social justice? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Oh, no, anything but that. 
  [Szczepula] But what is the difference between social 
justice and plain justice? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] There are two ways of looking at it. Either 
social justice is the same as plain justice, and then the 
adjective "social" becomes superfluous, or social justice is 
something different from plain justice, which would indicate 
that it is, in fact, injustice. For example, justice would 
dictate that Kowalski be remunerated for his work on the one 
hand and punished for the crime of homicide by hanging on the 
other. In turn, injustice, which is another word for social 
justice, would insist that all of the Kowalskis who earn, say, 
Z1.4 million per month, receive benefits and privileges just 
because they are low-paid. But, among all of these Kowalskis, 
there may be some who try but just cannot earn more and some who 
do not even feel like trying. Justice cannot be collective. 
  [Szczepula] The abortion issue has returned to the Sejm 
again. The ruling coalition intends to take advantage of 
it--for political reasons--in the forthcoming local 
self-government election. UPR is against abortion. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, we are. We believe that there should be 
a clear provision in our legislation stating that the Polish 
state is not in favor of abortion. UPR supports women. We are 
interested in securing a law that will stop men blackmailing 
women by saying: "If you do not have an abortion, I will leave 
you." At present, thanks to the law on protection of the unborn 
child, men find it more difficult to force women to make such 
decisions. In the meantime, life itself has shown that the 
infanticide statistics have not gone up as predicted by 
feminists. Of course, pathological cases do happen still, but 
these have always happened regardless of legislation. 
  Let me make myself clear. We do not propose that women be 
punished for abortion. Definitely not. We recommend that the 
Israeli model be adopted in our practice. In Israel, abortion 
is a punishable offense, but the courts almost never resort to 
making use of the relevant paragraph of the penal code. But 
they still call evil by its name. 
  [Szczepula] Let us turn again to current political issues. 
Most observers would nominate Aleksander Kwasniewski as the 
Left's principal candidate for the office of president. You, on 
the other hand, claim that the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
will officially nominate Jozef Oleksy. 
  [Korwin-Mikke] I am convinced that that is what will happen. 
Mr. Oleksy is simply a more suitable candidate for the function 
of "the father of the nation": He genuflects in churches and 
has a generally winsome personality.... On the other hand, Mr. 
Kwasniewski, with his ladder-climbing feats [reference to 
Kwasniewski's recent attempt at avoiding media attention after a 
major political meeting] is surely a less serious candidate. 
  [Szczepula] Does Oleksy stand a chance? 
  [Korwin-Mikke) He does, provided some disaster occurs--such 
as Mr. Walesa's decision to run in the election. 
  [Szczepula] Would that be a disaster? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Of course, because it could happen that the 
Right's votes will become fragmented, and then both Mr. Walesa 
and Mr. Oleksy will enter the second round of the election. And 
then Mr. Oleksy will be certain to win. 
  [Szczepula] So, will the whole camp representing the former 
democratic opposition mobilize itself and nominate their own 
candidate? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Let us not believe in mirages. But I can 
tell you that UPR does have a candidate--a man from outside all 
of the present political configurations--who is certain to win 
once he agrees to run in the election. 
  [Szczepula] Who is that? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] It is too early for me to tell you. 
  [Szczepula] Is he a well-known figure? 
  [Korwin-Mikke] Yes, of course. 
  [Szczepula] Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jan Maria Rokita, chairman of the Union of </F>
Freedom's Krakow regional branch, by correspondent "Jam"; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] Does the result of the election 
of the Union of Freedom chairman not indicate that two parallel 
but counteropposed orientations exist within the Union of 
Freedom's [UW] Krakow regional organization? 
  [Rokita] It is certainly a clear indication that the efforts 
and arguments I brought to the task of shaping the Democratic 
Union over the past two years, on both the national scene and 
here in Krakow, have somewhat eroded my authority. However, I 
believe that a politician's authority is not something to 
cultivate artificially but something to engage--even at a 
risk--in fighting for just causes. My determined involvement in 
the campaign to achieve a coalition with the Liberals, then in 
the unification process and then in the effort to rid that party 
of its openly anticlerical and prosocialist tendencies, has 
naturally impaired my authority to a certain extent. Given 
these circumstances, I view the result of the election as my own 
personal success. 
  [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] The Krakow Liberals do not appear to be 
particularly pleased with the course and outcome of the 
unification campaign. Does this not pose a special, rather 
delicate problem for the UW regional chairman? 
  [Rokita] It certainly creates a need for an honest, thorough 
discussion with the activists from the former Liberal Democratic 
Congress [KLD] structures. We recently had some differences 
connected with the postulated composition of the election list 
to be prepared by our new, joint coalition. I will not deny 
that I made some considerable concessions for the Liberals. I 
take full personal responsibility for these concessions, as I 
made them against considerable pressure from certain structures 
hailing from the former Democratic Union [UD]. This was not an 
easy thing to do because many UD members still remember the 
KLD's inauspicious beginnings in Krakow at the time that party 
was still a marginal group set up by local anarchists. However, 
that part of their past is now behind us, especially because the 
present leadership of the Krakow KLD organization had nothing to 
do with that episode. I trust we will be able to resolve 
certain questions hinging on personal ambitions. In any case, I 
do not predict any serious or lasting conflict based on these 
minor difficulties. 
  [CZAS KRAKOWSKI] On the other hand, a much more serious 
conflict, in which you are involved, arose at the central level 
of your new party structures. You clashed quite sharply with 
Sejm Deputy Barbara Labuda. How do you propose to resolve this 
problem? 
  [Rokita] I cannot yet specify the detailed procedure by 
which our conflict will be resolved, but I can already say that 
I have no doubt that, given her record in the parliamentary vote 
on the budget and the preparation of the new constitution, and 
considering her fanatical attacks against the Catholic Church 
and her part in the abortion debate, it is only a question of 
time before Barbara Labuda leaves the UW parliamentary caucus 
and, indeed, the party as such. However, the difficulty here is 
that her temperament does not allow her to leave the party of 
her own will, despite the open conflict and contentious argument 
she has with almost the entire party on almost all of the 
possible issues. But there is no question that a solution to 
this problem will have to be found.

<F P=106> [Article by E.M.: "Who Invests in Poland and How?"] </F>
  [Text] Toward the end of 1992, the number of joint ventures 
registered in Poland exceeded 10,000. Of this total, 5,740 
provided financial reports, meaning that they actually operated. 
In reality, however, that number was higher because companies 
with fewer than five employees are exempt from the duty of 
reporting. The sum total of the capital invested amounted to 
$1.4 billion, compared with $490 million toward the end of 1991. 
  The foreign investors are led by the Americans, who invested 
altogether $933 million by the end of 1992, mostly in the form 
of large investments averaging $23 million per company, as 
compared with an average of $246,000 per company for foreign 
investments as a whole. Next to the Americans were Italian 
investors ($270 million total), followed by transnational 
corporations and international financial institutions, and, 
last, by investors from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, 
France, Great Britain, Sweden, and Belgium. 
  The Italians led in boldness of investment projects--their 
investment plans envisage an additional $1 billion. The 
Americans, too, plan to invest about $1 billion. Eighty percent 
of all foreign investments in Poland derive from the 10 
countries named above. Noteworthy is the unusually low level of 
investment by Japanese companies in Poland. 
  In the subsector structure of foreign investments, 
industrial 
enterprises rank foremost, accounting for 64 percent of all 
capital invested; they were followed by trade (17 percent), 
transportation (3.7 percent), and construction (3.2 percent). In 
1992, the proportion of foreign investments in transportation 
and construction decreased, but in trade it increased. 
Approximately $400 million in foreign capital has been invested 
in the electrical-machinery industry. 
  As in the case of the countries of origin of capital 
investment, the geographical distribution of investment sites is 
markedly uneven. Most investments are concentrated in seven or 
eight voivodships, chiefly in the Warsaw (30 percent), Poznan, 
Gdansk, Szczecin, Katowice, Koszalin, and Torun voivodships. In 
comparison, the proportion of investments in such [eastern] 
voivodships as Tarnobrzeg, Chelm, Zamosc, Przemysl, Krosno, and 
many others was negligible. 
  Such are some of the data provided in the fourth regular 
report of the Institute for Business Cycles and Foreign Trade 
Prices (IKC), authored by Dr. J. Biskup and Dr. W. Burzynski. 
According to them, that report deals with only some aspects of 
the situation in 1993 owing to the absence of the data needed 
for a comprehensive analysis of the operations of joint 
ventures. Such an analysis will be presented in the next report, 
to be published this coming summer. In comparison with its 
previous issues, the report presented does, however, contain 
some new elements. It is a compendium of data on all of the 
major foreign companies operating in Poland and, in its final 
part, presents figures on the growth of direct foreign 
investments in the world and their role in the world economy. 
This serves to evaluate the significance of foreign capital to 
the growth of the Polish economy against a broader background. 
  The IKC report discusses in some detail the laws governing 
foreign investments and specifies the legal acts concerned, 
which can be of practical importance to potential investors. It 
also contains many specific data on the operations and financial 
status of companies. The aggregate value of the projects 
launched by joint ventures amounted to somewhat more than 4 
trillion zlotys [Z]. Investments worth more than Z20 billion 
each were undertaken by 53 companies,those worth Z10-20 billion 
each by 43 companies, and those of less than Z500 million by 792 
companies. As much as 79 percent of the companies engaged in no 
investment projects at all. Joint ventures contracted in 1992 
bank loans totaling Z21.6 trillion, or nearly four times as much 
as in 1991. Of that total, more than half were in the form of 
foreign credits. The overall sales volume of these companies 
exceeded Z145 trillion, with the domestic market accounting for 
most (72 percent) of the sales. Exports accounted for 26 
percent. Industrial enterprises handled 70 percent of the sales 
of their own products and services, followed by construction 
enterprises, with 6.4 percent, and transportation and trading 
enterprises, with 4.4. percent. 
  In 1992, joint ventures employed altogether 230,000 
people--i.e., about 2 percent of total employment in Poland. A 
year previously they had employed fewer than 120,000 people. 
  The Ministry of Internal Affairs considered 1,126 requests 
from foreigners for the purchase of real estate, of which it 
approved 876 (including 518 requests from physical persons) and 
declined 112. In Warsaw Voivodship, 64 hectares of land were 
sold to foreigners, in Szczecin Voivodship 39, in Poznan 
Voivodship 29, in Tarnow Voivodship 19, in the Nowy Sad and 
Zielona Gora voivodships 18 each, in Opole Voivodship 15, and in 
the Wroclaw and Katowice voivodships 11 each. 
  Particularly interesting aspects of the report concern the 
findings of studies of the incentives and disincentives for 
foreign companies as regards investing in Poland. The biggest 
incentive for investing is the prospects for economic growth and 
the size of the market. Another consideration is the agreements 
concluded by Poland concerning the establishment of free-trade 
zones. On the other hand, foreign investors ascribed relatively 
little importance to the evolving political situation in this 
country. (However, following the recent elections [in which the 
postcommunists won] and in view of the ongoing political 
donnybrook, this may change.) 
  It turns out that bureaucratic barriers are probably the 
strongest disincentive for investing in our country. Civil 
servants often simply shy away from making final decisions. In 
addition, the quality of our managerial personnel elicits doubt. 
Other negative considerations include the underdevelopment of 
the economic infrastructure, the frequent revisions of the tax 
system, and the fatal--in the eyes of foreign 
entrepreneurs--tariff policy.

<F P=106> [Report by M. Maric: "Biljana Plavsic -- He Who Attacks the </F>
National Interests Will Inevitably Lose"] 
  [Text] Banja Luka -- In a statement for GLAS SRPSKI, 
Biljana Plavsic, vice president of the republic of Srpska, among 
other things, touched upon the speech FRY President Zoran Lilic 
made at the congress of the Yugoslav Trade Union Federation in 
Novi Sad the day before yesterday. 
  "Statements made by some SPS [Socialist Party of Serbia] 
officials or by some people belonging to the SPS, in which they 
advocate the need to give in to blackmail in the peace process 
are suddenly along the same line as the SPO [Serbian Renewal 
Movement] (perhaps one should not say suddenly, because similar 
things have been happening for a long time whenever the national 
question is discussed and when Serbs in Krajina and the republic 
of Srpska are concerned). In this respect, they do not differ 
from Vuk Draskovic who had said: `Send them there, let them 
live together with the Muslims.' And when Zoran Lilic says `we 
no longer want to be hostages to the Serbian people in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina,' he is only putting it a little differently. 
  "Democracy suits the Serbian people, and I do not know how, 
with such views, it could endure the 50-year torture of an 
undemocratic regime. The Serbian people have a rich history and 
that helps it to survive on this Balkan wasteland. Therefore, 
all those people who attack the basic national interests will 
inevitably lose. Such changes will happen in Serbia as well, 
although everything is happening a little more slowly there. 
Things were happening in this way here, because we were thrown 
into events that occurred quickly and into dangerous situations. 
However, I am convinced that this will happen in Serbia as 
well," Biljana Plavsic concluded.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
national assembly of the Bosnian Serb republic Momcilo Krajisnik 
said on Friday that "there is no rift between the Serb republic 
and Serbia, no-one shall cast a doubt on the harmony and 
determination of the Serb people and the justified objective -- 
life in one state, will be realized." 
  Commenting the many speculations in the public about a 
cooling in relations between Belgrade and Pale, Krajisnik said 
"we perhaps have different views on many things, but this cannot 
be described as cooling in any way." The speculations on a 
cooling of relations were triggered by a statement on Tuesday by 
Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic who said that Yugoslav citizens 
cannot be hostages of any leader from the territory of the 
Former Republic of Yugoslavia [as received], the Serb republic, 
or the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia. 
  Pointing out that the two-year war of Moslems, Serbs and 
Croats in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina "has to end," Lilic 
said at the time when ceasefire negotiations between the warring 
sides were underway in Geneva that the Yugoslav people "rightly 
expect the peace talks to succeed and cannot agree to the option 
that they are infinitely prolonged and undermined." 
  In a statement to the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA, 
Krajisnik said that Lilic's statement "is not sufficiently 
defined and precise, and has therefore created confusion, but it 
cannot pertain to the Serb people in the Serb republic or in the 
republic of Serb Krajina." 
  The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a federation of Serbia 
and Montenegro, is under comprehensive and binding sanctions 
which were imposed in May 1992 by the United Nations Security 
Council because of its alleged involvement in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina war. [word indistinct] sanctions present a 
big problem and we are all engaged in the utmost towards their 
lifting, and different views should not be taken to mean a 
rift," Krajisnik said, adding that he his experience with 
Belgrade was positive. "In the contacts so far, Lilic has shown 
a special devotion to the Serb national issue and we hope he 
will elucidate on the stand he recently voiced," Krajisnik 
concluded. 
  Special U.N. envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and 
representatives of Bosnian Serbs and the Moslem-Croat Federation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina signed an agreement on a one-month 
ceassation of mostilities in Geneva on Wednesday. Akashi had 
proposed a four-month ceasefire, and the Serb Republic was for a 
lasting agreement, but it adopted the Japanese diplomat's 
proposal. The Moslem-Croat delegation, however, agreed 
four-weeks as the longest possible period for a ceasefire.

Anyone To Be Our Hostage"] 
  [Text] Banja Luka 9 June -- In light of the statement by 
[FRY President] Zoran Lilic that the citizens of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia cannot be the hostages of the political 
leaders from the republic of Srpska, the republic of Serbian 
Krajina, or the FRY, Radovan Karadzic in a statement for JAVNOST 
emphasized: 
  "We do not believe that President Lilic referred to us when 
he spoke about sabotage of the negotiations. As regards 
Yugoslavia distancing itself from this problem, we have always 
favored something of the kind. We do not wish anyone to be our 
hostage, however, we will, by the same token, not accept the 
fate of Mica Ljubibratic, the leader of the Herzegovina 
uprising, or the outcome of the Berlin Congress." 
  "Therefore, we do not accept any custody over us. We have 
created our own state and our aim is to unite with Serbia into 
one state. If this is not possible, then with Yugoslavia as a 
federation, and if even this is not possible, then we will 
remain an independent state until the unification with our 
mother country is facilitated for us."

  [Text] Pale, 10 Jun (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic said at a news conference in Pale today that 
the Serbian side made the maximum effort to save the latest 
peace talks in Geneva. The Muslim side was successfully 
torpedoing the talks all the time. They began by setting 
nonsensical preconditions concerning Gorazde, and when even the 
minutest details were ironed out, they proposed the signing of 
some kind of four-week cease-fire, Karadzic said. 
  "We could have refused, but we wished to give the conference 
a chance and we finally accepted Akashi's proposal for a 
month-long truce," Karadzic added. He assessed that the world 
media finally realized after the Geneva gathering that the 
Serbian side is for peace, while it became clear to everyone 
that the Muslim side is for war. Karadzic also said that the 
Geneva agreement is not at the level of a cease-fire, but that 
it carries certain weight nevertheless, primarily applying to 
POW swaps, which is an element of a cessation of hostilities. 
We have succeeded in this respect, because our opponents 
promised to carry out the exchange. 
  Commenting on the vote in the U.S. House of Representatives 
with regard to lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia's 
Muslims, Karadzic said that this decision is not legally 
binding. "I do not know how this decision could be translated 
into practice when the embargo itself does not exist. The 
Muslims are receiving arms on a daily basis. This could help 
certain countries unilaterally lift their embargo against us," 
he said. 
  The republic of Srpska president recalled that Clinton could 
use his power of veto, and that this decision is a form of 
pressure aimed at effecting the acceptance of a new peace plan. 
"I believe that a new map is being prepared, a map unacceptable 
to us, and partly acceptable to the Muslims. That is why we 
should establish cooperation with the international community as 
soon as possible and take part in drawing up these maps, so we 
can tell them precisely what is and what is not acceptable," 
Karadzic said. 
  Commenting on hints that the sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia might be lifted, Karadzic said that this 
is an attempt to create the illusion of America's impartiality. 
The sanctions should nevertheless be lifted, regardless of the 
outcome of the talks on Bosnia, because these sanctions are 
affecting a country that is not at war. 
  Speaking about the latest cease-fire which came into effect 
at noon today, the republic of Srpska president said that the 
republic of Srpska would now assume a position of passive 
defense. However, if the Muslims fail to honor the cease-fire, 
we will turn this into active defense, so they risk losing 
everything, Radovan Karadzic concluded.

  [Text] Novi Sad, June 12 (TANJUG) -- President of the 
parliament of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.) Momcilo 
Krajisnik, with reference to the latest one-month ceasefire 
signed in Geneva, has stated that the Muslims will not agree to 
any peace irrespective of its limited length. Krajisnik said 
this in an interview to be published in Monday's DNEVNIK daily 
of Novi Sad. He added that perhaps it was better that a 
short-range truce was signed in Geneva. 
  "Had they accepted the Serb proposal on a year-long 
cessation 
of hostilities," said he, "they would have presented themselves 
to the world as the fighters for peace, but, essentially, they 
do not give up their offensive actions against Serb territories." 
  Geneva talks on the overall cessation of hostilities in 
Bosnia ended on June 7 in signinig a statement on a one-month 
cessation of combat activities, based on the Muslim-Croat 
proposal. In commenting on a territorial division map drawn by 
the "contact group" in Geneva, Krajisnik said that this had 
concerned the fulfilment of the megalomaniac demands by Croats 
and Muslims to be given nearly the entire western Bosnia and 
good parts of northern and eastern Bosnia. 
  "Of course, it is out of the question that we shall agree to 
give the places where genocide of Serb people was committed in 
the past two wars," said Krajisnik.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 12 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Ratko 
Mladic, chief of staff of the army of the republic of Srpska, 
tonight told Serb Radio's Sarajevo Studio that Muslim and Croat 
forces again failed today to comply with the cease-fire on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's front lines. The heaviest attacks on the 
republic of Srpska were launched in the Brcko area. There were 
also enemy provocations on other front lines, Mladic said. 
  "We are going to continue our full compliance with what we 
agreed to in Geneva, i.e. to refrain from offensive operations 
and we are going to tolerate their attacks as long as they are 
not a serious threat to the republic of Srpska and the Serbian 
people," the chief of staff of the army of the republic of 
Srpska said. He also said that the army of the republic of 
Srpska "will not allow enemy forces to enjoy their leisure." 
  "We are following all their efforts to consolidate their 
ranks within this month of cease-fire and to arm themselves and 
prepare offensive operations, something they hinted at even 
before their arrival in Geneva," General Mladic said.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 12 (AFP) -- Rockets slammed into 
the northern Serb-held town of Brcko on Sunday [12 June], but 
Bosnia's fragile two-day-old truce was otherwise holding, a UN 
spokesman said. Five or six rockets from an unknown source fell 
at midday in the first truce violation at Brcko since the 
UN-brokered ceasefire came into effect on Friday, Commander Eric 
Chaperon said. 
  "However, the overall situation remains calm, with a 
slightly 
higher level of activity than in the morning," he said in 
mid-afternoon. [passage omitted] Chaperon said earlier he did 
not know where the shells had been fired from. 
  Brcko commands a narrow strip of land across northern 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that forms a crucial supply line for Serbs 
between their stronghold of Banja Luka in the west and Serbia to 
the east. The area, known as the Posavina corridor, has seen a 
build-up by both Bosnian army and separatist Serb forces in the 
past two months. 
  Chaperon said UN troops recorded 11 detonations at the 
northeastern town of Srebrenik, a few detonations at Dastansko, 
in central Bosnia, and 16 mortar rounds at Ribnica, a Bosnian 
army position in the north of the republic. A UN patrol at 
Gorazde in eastern Bosnia "came under light arms fire from 
Bosnian Serb forces," Chaperon added. 
  In the northwestern Moslem pocket of Bihac, the situation 
was 
calm Sunday after attacks a day earlier by Bosnian army forces 
in which they recovered territory captured by secessionists 
loyal to maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic, Chaperon said.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 13 (TANJUG) -- UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Forces] representative in Sarajevo confirmed Sunday 
night [12 June] that the forces of Bosnian Croats launched an 
offensive against the Serbs in Bosnia in the north of the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As the UPI news agency 
reported, he specified that at least five projectiles were fired 
from multiple rocket launchers Sunday on Brcko, a Serb town in 
northern Bosnia. 
  This action by Bosnian Croats surprised the U.N., said the 
UNPROFOR representative. According to the Bosnian Serbs' 
military sources, five civilians, including a child and a Serb 
soldier, were wounded when from the territory of neighboring 
Croatia 8 projectiles were fired from the multiple rocket 
launchers on civilian targets in Brcko. 
  This was the eighth artillery attack on Brcko over the past 
month, and the fifth from the territory controlled by the 
forcibly seceded former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia. The 
attacks killed a total of seven and wounded 46 people either on 
the street or at home. 
  The attack on Brcko came in spite a four-week ceasefire, 
concluded last Wednesday in Geneva, which came into force on 
Friday at noon between the Moslem-Croatian federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.).

  [Excerpts] Brcko, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Six people were 
wounded in an artillery shelling of the Serb town of Brcko in 
northeastern Bosnia on Sunday, the town's press centre said in 
the evening. [passage omitted] The enemy was again shelling 
civilan targets, mostly residential buildings, inflicting 
extensive damage, and only rain, which has forced most people 
off the streets, kept the number of casualties as low as it was. 
This was the eighth artillery shelling of Brcko in the last 
month, and fifth from the direction of Croatia. A total of 
seven people were killed and 46 others were wounded in the 
attacks. The local U.N. observer team has duly informed the 
Tuzla-based command of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for 
northeastern Bosnia and the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo of each 
incident, lodging protests.

  [Text] Petrovac, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Moslem 
clashes continued on Sunday morning [12 June] in the autonomous 
provice of western Bosnia (APWB), local Moslem media reported. 
Radio Velkaton in Velika Kladusa, the APWB administrative 
centre, reported that apwb military and civilian targets along 
the entire fromtline were continuously attacked by moslem forces 
loyal to the Sarajevo-based central Moslem authorities headed by 
fundamentalist leader Alija Izetbegovic. The radio reported 
losses on both sides, but did not specify whether the frontline 
was moved. 
  Izetbegovic's Radio Cazin and Radio Sarajevo reported 
fiercest clashes at Pecigrad and Todorov where Izetbegovic's 
forces strongly attack the APWB forces which were trying hard to 
defend themselves. Izetbegovic's media added that an APWB 
brigade changed sides and took hold of several hamlets around 
Todorovo in the past 24 hours, moving considerably the frontline. 
  World news agencies, however, quoted Eric Chaperon, UNPROFOR 
(U.N. Protection Force) spokesman in Sarajevo, as stating that 
the APWB forces made an advance in the attack they began on 
Friday. Chaperon said that the Izetbegovic forces were 
suppressed from the line of contact in acute attacks which used 
heavy artillery and mortars, with losses indicated to have been 
suffered by both sides. 
  Major Yvon Desjardins, UNPROFOR spokesman in Zagreb, 
specified that heavy fighting continued on Sunday morning in the 
central and western sections of the Bihac pocket in the APWB 
territory, whence reports came about APWB leader Fikret Abdic 
forces' opening artillery and tank-gun fire. Maj. Desjardins, 
however, could not immediately confirm the reports that 
Izetbegovic's forces had lost some of their territories. 
  Fikret Abdic, the opponent of the war option backed by Alija 
Izetbegovic, last autumn proclaimed the APWB (Autonomous 
Province of Western Bosnia) and immediately agreed a truce with 
Bosnian Serbs and Croats.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Excerpts] Early this morning Mayor Mirsad Crnkic, 
commander of the 511th Glorious Bosanska Krupa Brigade, died 
after being shot [words indistinct] on the front line by a 
maverick bullet from the positions of Abdic's rebels and 
traitors. [passage omitted] 
  Since early this morning the members of Abdic's rebel 
paramilitary have been shelling the areas of Pecigrad, Skokovi, 
Todorovo, Golubovici, (Pljanici), and (Krivaja). They have 
attempted several infantry breakthroughs, thus proving that 
their warmongers are not giving up on further conflicts 
regardless of the means and human cost. Since yesterday they 
have destroyed dozens of houses and inflicted several 
casualties. This is why they obviously do not want to carry out 
the agreed exchange of the bodies of killed soldiers. 
  Karadzic's chetniks have been abundantly helping out the 
Kladusa paramilitary as they have been firing with antiaircraft 
weapons and small arms throughout the night and this morning on 
the (Bihac) and Bosanska Krupa fronts. They have also 
intensified their activities on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau. 
Our defenders have not been responding to these attacks in 
compliance with the arranged cease-fire.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, 13 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serbs attacked a 
British UN patrol in northern Bosnia, UN officials said Monday 
[13 June], in the latest violation of a three-day-old ceasefire 
aimed at breaking the cycle of violence in Bosnia. But while 
also reporting other clashes, a UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] 
spokesman insisted that the ceasefire had generally held since 
coming into force Friday [10 June]. The truce signed in Geneva 
last week was intended to make time for talks on an overall 
settlement. 
  "Conflict continued to decrease substantially over the past 
two days indicating continuing compliance with at least the 
spirit of cessation-of-hostilities agreement," UNPROFOR 
spokesman Eric Chaperon said. The British UNPROFOR patrol, 
comprising two Warrior armoured troop carriers, fired back after 
being targetted by 15-20 mortar shells and several bursts of 
machine gun fire Sunday evening, Chaperon said. 
  "The Warriors were clearly showing the UN flag, therefore it 
was a deliberate attack against UNPROFOR," said a UN Protection 
Force report issued in Kiseljak, northern Bosnia. The incident 
happened on a Moslem-Serb frontline north of Maglaj, near the 
village of Halilovici, it said. 
  Chaperon said 30 machine gun bullets hit the armoured 
vehicle, but there were no casualties. The British UN forces 
responded by firing 80 7.62 mm shots before withdrawing a short 
distance. The patrol was targetted again about two hours later 
by about 20 mortar shells, Chaperon continued. Ten of them 
landed some 10 metres (yards) of the Warriors. Following the 
second attack the patrol withdrew to Halilovici, Chaperon said, 
adding that on both occasions the shots were fired from Serb 
positions. He added that UNPROFOR commanders on the ground did 
not request air support from North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
planes. The British patrol was in a new zone, which could have 
surprised the Serbs, he added. [passage omitted] 
  In a separate development, a Jordanian UN soldier was 
injured 
Sunday in a mine explosion in southern Croatia, a UNPROFOR 
spokesman said in the Croatia capital Zagreb. The officer lost 
a foot in the incident, which happened on a road on the front 
line between Croatian and Krajina Serb forces, the spokesman 
said, quoted by the HINA news agency. It said the road in 
question had been cleared and demined by the Jordanian UN 
battalion in the region during the day.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- British General Sir 
Michael Rose, commander of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
for the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, assessed an overall 
one-month truce in Bosnia, which took effect on Friday noon 
(1000 GMT), as `the beginning of the end of the war.' Gen. Rose 
told the press in Sarajevo that thousands of peacekeepers would 
be deployed throughout Bosnia to monitor the four-week truce 
signed by representatives of warring sides in Geneva on 
Wednesday. Gen. Rose warned that a U.S. Congressional vote to 
unilaterally lift an arms embargo on Bosnian moslems, passed on 
Thursday, could undermine peace efforts. `I hope it does not 
raise false hope in people's minds. You know it has been an 
aspiration of the Bosnian Government. Their view that "give us 
the weapons and we'll finish the job" is fairly widespread, but 
my own view is that it takes a lot more than just being given 
equipment to win a war.' 
  The U.N. Security Council in the Autumn of 1991 introduced 
an 
arms embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in an effort to contribute 
to settling ethnic conflicts there. The Bosnian Moslems, 
strongly supported by Islamic countries, have for months called 
for their exemption from the arms embargo. 
  UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon also on Friday in Sarajevo 
said that the intensity of fighting in Bosnia has not been on 
such a low level for over a year, as it was a few hours before 
the ceasefire took effect. Sporadic artillery fire was reported 
in northern and central Bosnia, but the intensity was half as 
strong as the previous day, Chaperon said. 
  According to U.N. monitors reporting, there were only 80 
artillery shells fired on Friday on the frontline between 
Gradacac and Ribnica in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for 
example, while the previous day 389 shells were fired in the 
same area.

<F P=106> [Report by Milorad Vukasinovic from Banja Luka -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] The formation of the Socialist Party of Serbia in 
the republic of Srpska does not mean the beginning of disunity 
but reflects peoples' need for the activity of a political party 
that favors the creation of a humane and democratic society on 
these territories, it was stated at the gathering of the Young 
Socialists in Banja Luka today. 
  Greeting all present in the name of the large delegation of 
the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS], Federal Human Rights 
Minister Margit Savovic expressed the belief that the left wing 
in the republic of Srpska holds the future. It was emphasized 
that freedom, just peace, and the right to self-determination 
for the Serbian people are the fundamental program goals of this 
party which expects to become a significant political factor in 
the republic of Srpska in the coming period. 
  [Dragan Ilic, president of the SPS in the republic of 
Srpska] 
The socialist ideal and the ideal of social justice has existed 
among these people for eons. Therefore, a political 
organization that embraces this idea, manifests it further 
politically, and places it at the service of the nation, had to 
appear. 
  [Sasa Cudic, president of the Alliance of the Young 
Socialists in the republic of Srpska] Above all I would 
emphasize that the strengthening of the SPS in the republic of 
Srpska has resulted in the strengthening of its progeny -- the 
Young Socialists. I would emphasize that young people on the 
territory of our republic during the war and in bleak times that 
have lasted for three years have had some difficult moments 
trying to find perspective for their lives. 
  Summing up today's promotional gathering, I can single out 
several basic values: Just peace, freedom, democracy, and the 
unity of the Serbian people. [end recording]

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb 
parliamentary Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik has stated that the Serb 
side has received assurances from the Moslems that they are 
willing to exchange all remaining POWs as agreed on Saturday [11 
June]. Krajisnik made the statement on Sunday after Bosnian 
Serbs and Moslems had resumed talks at Sarajevo airport on 
prisoner exchanges. 
  After the first round of talks on Saturday, the two sides 
agreed to complete the lists of POWs held by the International 
Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] to include those captured in 
the recent fighting on Mt. Ozren in the north and around Gorazde 
in the southeast. The exchanges are to take place at Sarajevo 
airport, in Gorazde and at Satorovici near Brcko in northern 
Bosnia. 
  The two sides also agreed that a meeting be held on 
Wednesday 
by local representatives to exchange information about the 
missing. At the next round of talks on Friday, the two sides 
will negotiate dates for the exchanges. 
  An ICRC spokesman said in Geneva on Friday the organization 
estimated that Bosnian Moslems and Croats were holding about 450 
persons prisoner and that the Serbs were holding approximately 
the same number of prisoners. The one-month truce which the 
Bosnian Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia 
signed on Wednesday envisages an immediate release of all 
prisoners, including POWs. The truce came into effect at noon 
on Friday.

<F P=106> [Report by Enes Musovic from Gorazde] </F>
  [Text] This morning at 0730 some 300 citizens of 
(Cazagici) and (Hudjer), districts within 3 km of the Gorazde 
center, started off by themselves toward their properties and 
homes. As they said, they could no longer bear to listen to 
daily misinformation about the chetniks having withdrawn from 
their homes. They could no longer wait for someone else to 
solve their problems, particularly as the UN Protection Forces 
[UNPROFOR] has not tried to do this in the only correct way. 
  However, they were stopped in front of the (Cazagici) 
district by a group of chetniks armed with machine guns, Osa and 
Zolja portable rocket launchers, and hand grenades, who started 
to abuse and provoke them while at the same time cocking their 
guns. Very soon UNPROFOR positioned in Gorazde intervened with 
transporters and a large number of soldiers, thus barring the 
citizens of (Hudjer) and (Cazagici) from reaching their homes. 
The situation turned very tense, but the [word indistinct] 
authorities prevented the unarmed people at the last moment from 
charging at the chetnik barrels. 
  It is obvious to everyone in Gorazde that the zone of three 
km from the city center has not been cleared, that the Serbian 
civilians are in fact Serb soldiers, and that they have remained 
in all their positions within this zone. All in all, the 
situation here is very tense and the likelihood of incidents and 
bloodshed seems to be increasing by the minute. 
  Victor Andreyev, chief of the UNPROFOR civilian section in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, was informed about this on 7 June when he 
visited Gorazde. However, UNPROFOR has done nothing about it, 
and is still deceiving the world with tales that the Serbian 
soldiers, Serbian police, and Serbian civilians have left the 
3-km zone from the center of Gorazde.

  [Text] At a session in Mostar today, the Presidency of the 
Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] of Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
discussing the present political situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and the Geneva talks. Zdenko Vranjes reporting: 
  [Vranjes] Speaking about the Geneva talks, Kresimir Zubak, 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation and president of 
the Presidential Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, 
said the most important thing agreed was that the question of 
corridors would be resolved in such a way as to give equal right 
to the use of corridors, i.e. to the linking of territories, to 
all three sides. The new proposals also contain ideas about 
gray zones and blue paths, i.e. the territories and paths that 
will be under international control until the final solution is 
reached. 
  Making the resumption of talks conditional upon the 
withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde turned out to be a good 
thing. They had to withdraw from Gorazde and give in and accept 
a one-month cease-fire--which was Croatia's proposal, said 
Zubak. He also said that the united Croat-Bosniak stand at the 
talks turned out to be successful. Zubak added that the 
political platform that the federation's delegation advocated in 
Geneva implied the survival of the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
which would be organized as a federal [slozena] state, 
consisting of the federation and the part presently under 
Serbian control. In such a federal state the constituent status 
of the Croatian people will be reflected both in the federation 
and in all the parts of the federal state. This option could be 
proposed by the Contact Group, together with the maps, according 
to the take it or leave it principle, said Zubak.

<F P=106> [Article by Dragan Marijanovic: "Who Is General Fikret </F>
Muslimovic, Appointed to the Joint Staff of the Croat Defense 
Council and Formations of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina? 
Officer Who Knows a Lot"] 
  [Text] If he has actually decided to weave the 
strings of power in his hands into something that implies a 
lasting peace, together with Corps General Ante Ros, which he 
recently promised during his visit to Medjugorje, then that is 
good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He finally has a real 
opportunity to materialize unity between Croats and Bosniaks, 
which he has always advocated, at least verbally. 
  Bosniak General Fikret Muslimovic, the main Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina officer for the Bosniak side in the recently 
formed Joint Staff of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and 
Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first Muslim general to visit 
Medjugorje since the unsuccessful and abortive meeting between 
Tudjman and Izetbegovic, which took place in the same location 
exactly one year earlier, when it turned out that despite the 
mediation of Owen and Stoltenberg, even in a place like 
Medjugorje miracles do not exactly happen every century, much 
less every day. 
  The generals who represented the two armies at that time 
were 
Slobodan Praljak for the Croats and Sefer Halilovic for the 
(still at that time) Muslims. Nothing came of the firm 
handshakes after the signing of the peace "documents" and the 
optimistic statements into the microphones of all the relevant 
world media companies. The war escalated, an unprecedented 
Muslim offensive in central Bosnia began, and hundreds of 
thousands of Croats were expelled. 
  At that time, former JNA [Yugoslav People's Army] Lieutenant 
Colonel Fikret Muslimovic, with the rank of colonel in the Army 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was on that army's General Staff as the 
head of all intelligence and security activities. He was in a 
position where he was considered the person to whom even the 
slightest whiff of dilettantism had to be attributed at the 
outset. The top intelligence officer--or "security officer," as 
he was called at the time--acquired his skill and agility 
through many years of service in the notorious department led by 
former JNA General Vasiljevic. Muslimovic was one of the main 
links in this murky chain even as the storm began to brew in 
Slovenia, and then in Croatia. In some insider circles in 
Sarajevo, it was said at the time that Muslimovic could have 
advanced much further if he had not happened to be a Muslim, 
which is very likely, although like the majority of officers in 
the former JNA who were not of Serb nationality, he identified 
himself as Yugoslav. 
  The Serb drums of war in Bosnia forced Lt. Col. Muslimovic 
to 
opt for the just-formed Territorial Defense, an offshoot of the 
Patriotic League, which was formed by people primarily of 
Sandzak origins. At the very outset of the war in and around 
Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Muslimovic, under 
the roof of the state presidency building, assumed the duties of 
head of a similar political agency, attempting to apply the 
experience gained in organizing the disbanded army to the new 
conditions. To the extent that the author of this article can 
recall those days and the talks with the present-day Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina general in Sarajevo, he mostly preferred 
Croat-Muslim unity and the need to "go to the Drina together"; 
however, it never occurred to him to acknowledge the real 
contribution of the HVO to that common cause. 
  At the time, Muslimovic was among the people who, after the 
establishment of a tolerable Muslim defense in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, felt that they should take the matter into 
their own hands and that other defense units should join them 
according to plans drawn up in Sarajevo, which of course did not 
work at all. At that time, Muslimovic's sympathies were reserved 
for the HOS [Croatian Defense Force], which had experienced a 
precipitous fall in esteem among the Croat nation. During that 
period, Muslimovic's main associates were certain Sandzak 
commanders, especially a young man nicknamed Zagi, and it is 
impossible to say how it is that some of the people around 
Muslimovic were in fact unsuccessful in defending certain parts 
of Sarajevo. 
  From the beginning, he was opposed to the creation of any 
Croat state community in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and at the mention 
of Herceg-Bosna this seemingly peaceful man would react in a 
manner that is inadvisable for such a high-ranking officer. He 
also selected some Croats as his associates, people who under 
such circumstances were deprived of any and all autonomy, which 
certainly comes as no surprise since the top Muslim soldier and 
Muslimovic's boss at the time was Sefer Halilovic, who ended the 
way he did. After his fall, Muslimovic advanced in the service, 
and he has in fact experienced his professional finale in recent 
days, with his appointment to the Joint Staff of the HVO and 
formations of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which role he 
has remained in Medjugorje as the head of the Bosniak military 
delegation, which has begun working on the more concrete 
implementation of the signed agreements together with a 
corresponding delegation from the HVO. 
  Gen. Muslimovic has not concealed his satisfaction with what 
has been achieved, and he brims over with optimism. Curiously 
enough, he has not mentioned a "joint advance to the Drina," 
although he did so before the agreements, when as part of the 
Muslim negotiating team he negotiated with Croat military 
delegations, mostly at the Sarajevo airport. What happens in the 
period to come will show whether this means that Gen. Muslim has 
finally understood the logic that the HVO is no one's mercenary 
army and that it exists exclusively to protect Croat interests 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But one thing is sure: Muslimovic is the 
officer in the Bosniak ranks who knows the most, and he pulled 
some of the strings during the Croat-Muslim fighting. If he has 
actually decided to weave the strings of power in his hands into 
something that implies a lasting peace, together with Corps 
General Ante Ros, which he recently promised during his visit to 
Medjugorje, then that is good for Croats and for Bosniaks. He 
finally has a real opportunity to materialize unity between 
Croats and Bosniaks, which he has always advocated, at least 
verbally. He himself will have to come face to face with the 
possible fragments of a troubled conscience during the war with 
the Croats from the one-year phase of his military career.

  [Excerpts] A time bomb exploded during the night in 
Budapest at the National Assembly building. It blew to pieces 
gate number 19 -- the gate faces the Danube river -- and it 
broke several of the building's windows. Experts have found 
among the debris components that were part of the bomb. 
[passage omitted] 
  In order not to jeopardize the investigation, the police 
have 
not revealed any further information for the time being. 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz acquainted himself with the 
situation at the scene. Prime Minister Peter Boross was still 
in the building a few minutes ago. 
  Leading representatives of Hungarian political parties 
unequivocally condemned this act of terrorism and expressed 
their conviction that it was probably an act of madness by an 
individual and not linked to the results of the elections. 
Nonetheless, they urged the tightening of security regulations 
regarding the protection of the parliament.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 10 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Parliament 
Upper House President Radmilo Bogdanovic assessed on Friday that 
the time for easing the sanctions against the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) was approaching, judging by statements 
supporting a cessation of hostilities in the former Yugoslavia 
made by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the European Union. 
Bogdanovic said this during talks with representatives of the 
"Min" mechanical engineering factory in Nis (Serbia). 
  The United Nations in May 1992 imposed comprehensive 
sanctions against Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the 
civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  President Clinton was actually threatening the Bosnian 
Moslems when he spoke of the lifting of the sanctions against 
Yugoslavia, according to Slobodan Rakitic, opposition Depos 
[Democratic Movement of Serbia] bloc deputy in the Yugoslav 
Parliament. "The sanctions against Yugoslavia will be softened 
if a Moslem-Croat federation rejects a peace plan," a statement 
signed by Rakitic on behalf of a group of Depos MPs said. 
  Clinton's statement could be understood as a kind of 
confession that neither the introduction of sanctions had 
depended on Serbia, Montenegro and the Bosnian Serb Republic 
(R.S.), the statement also said. "If the lifting of the 
sanctions is announced now as punishing the Moslems for 
disobedience, then the introduction was a reward to a 
Moslem-Croat coalition for their war option," the announcement 
said. 
  Delegations of the Moslem-Croat Federation and of the 
Bosnian 
Serb republic signed on Wednesday in Geneva a one-month 
ceasefire accord, althouth the Serb side was for a one-year 
cessation of hostilities, estimating that a one-month ceasefire 
is too short for finding a political settlement to end the 
Bosnian war.

<F P=106> [Article by "(has)": "An Opposition Deputy Has Become Head </F>
of the Parliamentary Commission for the Security and Information 
Service"] 
  [Text] Prague--The reason Tomas Svoboda (Christian 
Democratic Party), chairman of the parliamentary commission for 
supervising the Security and Information Service (BIS), has 
resigned is apparently that he does not have enough time to 
execute his post. Svoboda has told LIDOVE NOVINY that "nothing 
more serious happened" and that he will carry on as deputy 
chairman of the commission. In connection with the anticipated 
discussion on the recall of T. Fejfar (Civic Democratic Party), 
deputy chairman of the Defense and Security Committee, Svoboda 
categorically rejected the possibility that he could take up 
this post. He described as speculation the CTK report that he 
aspires to the post of committee deputy chairman. The new 
chairman of the commission is current Deputy Chairman V. 
Doubrava (Czech Social Democratic Party) [CSSD]. In reply to a 
question on what he thinks of the fact that an opposition deputy 
chairs the commission for supervising the secret service, 
Svoboda said that "Doubrava is very objective."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marian Schmarcz: "Control Means Credibility </F>
for Secret Services"] 
  [Text] Despite the fact that intelligence services belong 
to executive bodies, it is impossible to apply the same open 
system of parliamentary control to them as to other central 
bodies. Intelligence services work with secrets on the 
preservation of which the security of the state depends. On the 
other hand, secret services pose a potential danger to human 
rights. The system of control over them has to take these two 
peculiarities into account. 
  In our country, this mechanism has been worked out for only 
the Security and Information Service [BIS]. The intelligence 
service and the Army's intelligence departments are working 
safely hidden under the shell of the Interior Ministry and the 
Defense Ministry, where they are based. According to BIS 
director Devaty, however, it is very unreasonable to reject 
parliamentary control. Parliamentary control most efficiently 
disperses suspicion that, under the lid of the intelligence pot, 
a dark soup of intrigues and political conspiracy is boiling. 
  It is usual in the world that primary control over the work 
of secret services is performed by the government, who also uses 
secret services' information to make decisions. Audit is a 
strong tool in this respect. The very fact that funds are being 
allocated to them on the basis of specific assignments keeps a 
tight hand on the intelligence service members. It is difficult 
to imagine that agents would finance possible subversive actions 
from their own funds. 
  Intelligence activity, however, closely touches upon the 
human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In the BIS case, 
the applicable law allows imposing limitations on them. 
Independent judges (as regards utilization of intelligence 
gathering technology, for instance), as well as a special 
parliamentary body, keep an eye on the respect for this law. 
This arrangement is usual in a number of European countries; it 
is not a rule, however. In the Netherlands, for example, this 
supervision is performed by a commission of selected ministers. 
  Our experience with the former State Security has led us to 
establish permanent and preventive parliamentary supervision 
over BIS, unlike in Great Britain, for instance, where the 
appropriate institutions inspect secret services only on the 
basis of a specific complaint. In France, there is no control 
over counterintelligence, which is part of the police. 
  Our deputies have at their disposal all of BIS's internal 
regulations (on record-keeping, internal control, etc.), and, 
thanks to that fact, they know how to proceed. From the 
accounting documents they receive, they can get a rough picture 
of BIS activities in individual spheres. They conduct their 
audits directly at workplaces of the secret service, and they 
can demand any data from the archive without any limitation. 
The principle of hierarchic limitation on access to information 
does not apply to them. Anyone at BIS who wants to see his 
colleague's folder must give a specific reason for that. The 
Czech secret service introduced these barriers after its bad 
experience with the former Federal Security and Information 
Service. It was precisely its benevolent internal regulations 
that made it easy for Wallis to dig into secret files. 
  Actions that are in progress, however, are the prohibited 
zone, where the secret service refuses to admit the deputies. 
The results of the secret service are always directly 
proportional to the extent to which the leak of information can 
be prevented. The service employees themselves do not know 
agents other than those to whom they directly give assignments. 
The law on BIS requires that the security of these people be 
protected, and data on them must not be divulged, not even to 
deputies. 
  Devaty concluded a gentleman's agreement with deputies that, 
at their request, he would close any file to allow them to 
inspect it. At the same time, he requires from the deputies that 
they assume their burden of responsibility for the possible 
consequences this could have on the security of the state or the 
lives of BIS members, who could be endangered by the deputies' 
indiscretion. Nothing like that has happened, however; on the 
other hand, no case of a well-founded complaint about the 
violation of human rights has been recorded. 
  A secret service worthy of that name will certainly never 
admit anyone from outside into its most intimate places, which 
are the files of the agents and cases in progress. If some law 
forced them to make these documents accessible, the intelligence 
staffers would rather keep their knowledge in their heads or 
somewhere else, leaving empty folders for the controllers. On 
the other hand, it is in the interest of all of the secret 
services to be as open as possible to parliamentary control (by 
opposition deputies, above all), if it is possible from the 
viewpoint of their operation. However, absolutely 
nontransparent military and police intelligence departments are 
hiding in the shadow of BIS, which is controlled by parliament 
and which operates according to law. This is not to the benefit 
of the credibility of special services as a whole.

  [Text] Zagreb, June 10 (TANJUG) -- Zagreb will not shrink 
from "war option as an ultimate means" to re-establish its 
authority in the U.N. Protected Area (UNPA) on the territory of 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia, said Jure Radic, head 
of the presidential office of Franjo Tudjman, Friday. 
  "This will be done through consistent peacemaking policy", 
but "we do not rule out war option either as an ultimate means," 
Radic, secretary-general of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union 
(HDZ), told a rally in Delnice. 
  According to Croatian media, Radic warned that Croatia this 
time openly pointed out that this was the "last unproductive 
mandate of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). If the U.N. 
forces were not deployed on the internationally-recognized 
Croatian borders, the Croatian Army would," he said. 
"Cypriotization of Croatia is out of question" as well as the 
possibility of part of Croatia "becomimg some other state," 
Radic stressed. 
  The UNPA in Croatia matches the Republic of Serb Krajina 
(R.S.K.), which was in 1991 proclaimed by the Serbs on the 
territories where they are majority population, in response to 
Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslavia and 
downgrading the status of the Serbs in the new state of Croatia 
from a constituent people to one of a natioanl minority. 
  Croatia does not recognize the R.S.K. and has attempted four 
times to forcibly return it under Zagreb's authority. The 
Krajina Serbs do not want to give up their independence, 
claiming that their state is legitinate, being created by 
breaking-up of the former Yugoslavia and that they, since they 
were a constituent people in the former state, have the right to 
self-determination. 
  Croatian President Tudjman has also on several occasions in 
recent months announced that Zagreb will re-establish authority 
in the entire territory of the former Yugoslav Republic of 
Croatia by force if not through negotiations.

  [Excerpt] Istanbul, 10 Jun, PAP--At their meeting in 
Istanbul on Friday, the foreign ministers of the NATO, Central 
European, and former USSR states, who make up the so-called 
North Atlantic Consultative Council [NACC], with unprecedented 
stubbornness disputed the text of the final communique, which 
extended the proceedings. 
  This pushed into the background the resolution of the nature 
of relations between Russia and NATO, although the issue has 
remained unclear. Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski 
stressed in his speech on Friday that Poland is "aware of the 
need for solid partnership between NATO and Russia," within and 
beyond the Partnership for Peace, but he warned that this should 
not lead to a "marginalizing of the smaller states, undermining 
their trust in NATO." He also gave assurances that countries 
such as Poland "want to join NATO not as frontline states but as 
factors promoting further cooperation." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Complete" news conference by Bosnian President Alija </F>
Izetbegovic with unidentified correspondents in Sarajevo on 11 
June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Izetbegovic] The main motive for my tour was to see 
army commanders at a military base in central Bosnia. I saw all 
corps commanders, except, of course, Army Brigadier Dudakovic, 
who is in Bihac [words indistinct] their military situation. 
There are two possible developments: that there is a cease-fire 
[words indistinct] in Geneva; and that there is no cease-fire. 
We discussed both possibilities, and we are ready to face both 
possibilities. I can say that I am glad and satisfied that we 
were ready for the continuation of fighting and for the 
cessation of fighting -- temporary, as it was concluded. 
  This lull could be very handy both for the Serbs and for us. 
We will use this lull to prepare ourselves for any possibility. 
We are not sure that Karadzic's Serbs are ready for a just 
peace. I think that at the moment there are no signs of them 
being ready for it. So, I am not a great optimist, although I 
really hope that we will restore peace, to avoid further 
bloodshed and suffering. I must admit that I am not optimistic 
that there will be peace. But, miracles have happened. This 
would be a miracle, but our army will be ready not only to 
defend, but also to gradually liberate land. 
  [Question indistinct on lifting of arms embargo] 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, a lot of attention has focused on that 
issue and with good reason -- especially (?in principle). It 
only remains for us to see what this will mean in practical 
terms. It will be very difficult to implement such a thing, and 
we are aware of that. We analyzed how it could be possible 
that, for example, American weapons really could arrive in 
Bosnia one day. There are many difficulties -- of a procedural 
nature and of a technical nature. Of course, the difficulties 
are mainly of a procedural nature because I do not think that 
America will go for a unilateral lifting of the embargo. 
Therefore, they will probably have to go through the UN 
Security Council, where they will have to encounter Russia, 
Great Britain and so on -- great enemies of the lifting of the 
embargo. It is possible that a repeated vote could result in a 
binding decision, but I think that in that case there would be 
different difficulties on the Russia-America line. There will 
certainly be many difficulties and our people should not take 
this for granted. 
  However, despite all that, this decision is of great 
importance. Above all, it is a major political victory for us, 
and also -- if this is of any importance at all -- a victory for 
a certain principle of justice, that is, the right to 
self-defense. In practical terms, the importance of the 
decision will be -- if not in the direct supply of arms to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina -- that it will be possible to use the 
decision as leverage for achieving other things. I think that in 
this respect the decision will be very important. For example, 
the decision could be leverage which could provide, not for the 
supply of arms to the Bosnian Army, but for the impounding of 
the arms from the other, aggressor's army. This is a proposal 
which we have been upholding for a long time, and which is known 
as our theory of balance. The problem of arms here is in fact 
not whether we will be given weapons. The problem is in 
establishing balance. 
  We have had a complete imbalance in armaments for three 
years. I say three years because it is just coming to three 
years since the war began. People forget that it did not begin 
two, but three years ago with a campaign in Slovenia; then it 
was continued in Croatia and so on. Silajdzic said again 
yesterday that a medicine which had not worked for three years 
must be the wrong one. 
  They stubbornly continue saying that the medicine [words 
indistinct]. The embargo retains an imbalance in armaments and 
encourages (?the other side), due to its technical superiority, 
not to be interested in joining serious negotiations. Therefore 
there are no serious negotiations, and consequently no peace. 
We say: Alright, let us take a different approach. Take the 
arms from them, so that there is a balance in armaments and 
serious negotiations and, ultimately, peace. 
  Therefore, this decision by the American Congress could have 
an impact on adopting this second approach -- to impound the 
arms from the aggressor's army. After all, such a proposal is 
included in UN Security Council Resolution [number indistinct]. 
The only problem is implementing it. 
  I said this recently in talks with American senators. I 
will use this opportunity to explain that idea of mine because 
it has been misinterpreted. I said -- as we have succeeded in 
establishing a 20-kilometer zone without Serbian arms in 
Sarajevo -- we could have a zone of 200 kilometers, that is, 
100-km in radius with a center on some other location in Bosnia, 
such as Zenica [words indistinct]. Bosnia would be completely 
covered. In that zone the aggressor's side would be ordered to 
withdraw its weapons and threatened with air strikes if it fails 
to comply. 
  This does not require the deployment of soldiers, which has 
met with wide-spread feeling of opposition in the West anyway. 
We are not asking for that, but it would be very effective 
[words indistinct] and lead to peace. Finally, with the help of 
this decision, there are ways of preventing Serbia and 
Montenegro from further supplying the aggressor's army in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with weapons. Our diplomacy is working on 
all that. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Izetbegovic] It gains in importance every day. First of 
all, Islamic countries are not great military powers, but they 
have now become involved in this conflict because they have sent 
soldiers to join UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. But their 
main role has been in providing humanitarian aid to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, of course, primarily political assistance 
and support, moral support. That is not unimportant and it 
should not be underestimated, although it does not yield 
material results immediately. The Islamic countries have also 
provided great humanitarian aid. 
  However, there is one weapon which we have not used yet and 
we will probably use it. The awareness of the following is 
growing in Islamic countries: Bosnia is becoming a test of the 
West's attitude towards Islamic countries. No Western country 
which fails to display a fair stance in this critical phase of 
the Bosnian crisis -- either in respect of the continuation of 
the war or a just peace -- no Western country can count on the 
friendship of Muslim countries and Muslim nations. On the other 
hand, I believe that Muslim countries and Muslim nations will 
consider as hostile any Western country which in these 
circumstances fails to adopt a fair stance on the Bosnian 
crisis. Not only because what is at issue here is the defense 
of democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but because this is 
primarily an attempt to destroy the Muslim people here. This is 
clear to Islamic countries. 
  I will personally do everything I can [words indistinct] use 
all my influence to make every Muslim and every Muslim leader, 
every nation, realize that what is going on here is the war 
against Muslim people. Therefore, they should make it clear to 
the governments in the West, they should tell them: We will act 
towards you in the same way you act in this crucial phase of the 
denouement in Bosnia. 
  [Question indistinct] 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, I had the opportunity to be a witness of 
that difficult haggling in Geneva. I was happy when I heard the 
outcome, and I saw it as a great diplomatic victory for us. I 
would also like to congratulate our delegation, headed by Mr. 
Ejup Ganic. 
  First of all, we managed to rid Gorazde of chetniks, owing 
to 
our perseverance and our refusal to negotiate before they 
withdraw. That is a big achievement because they had no 
intention of leaving the area. We have correspondence proving 
that those on the right bank of the river Drina claimed they 
would never leave. They were forced to withdraw. 
  That is one thing, and the other thing is that, as you know, 
our attitude to this issue was respected. There were two basic 
issues we defended in Geneva: The cease-fire can be temporary, 
not four months, but four weeks long. That was accepted. The 
second issue was that there should be no deployment of UN 
protection forces between the lines, which would freeze the 
lines. We said that we would do everything and take good care 
not to freeze the lines. As you know, that has not happened. 
The Serbs had to accept only routine control by UN forces, no 
deployment. We all know what the deployment of UNPROFOR between 
us and them could mean -- a final political solution. As you 
can see, we did not make this mistake, and I think that this 
round of talks [sentence ends; after a few seconds of silence, 
station carries music]

<F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Surjan, chairman of the Christian </F>
Democratic People's Party, KDNP, by Jozsef Szabo Bartha; place 
and date not given: "Surjan: The KDNP Has To Be Reorganized in 
a Professional Way"] 
  [Excerpt] [Bartha] [passage omitted] In your view, what 
are the main tasks of the national meeting convened for 25 June? 
  [Surjan] Christian ideology and democratic belief do not in 
themselves make anyone suitable to form or implement a Christian 
Democratic policy, or to fill the position of party leader. We 
must do away with the illusions. The Christian Democratic 
People's Party [KDNP] has to turn into a people's party that has 
a message for all strata of society. It has to have a powerful 
economic development and socially committed program for this. 
  [Bartha] If I am not wrong, you will reorganize the KDNP 
from top to bottom. 
  [Surjan] This is inevitable. As a result of the 
reorganization, we will need an executive chairman -- or perhaps 
a general secretary -- who is consistent and implements 
everything strictly. He has to be given rights that make him 
into a strong person in the party. I do not consider myself 
suitable for this position. 
  [Bartha] It is rumored that you would prefer to see 
parliamentary group leader Tibor Fuzessy beside yourself as this 
"force." 
  [Surjan] I will not talk about personnel issues. 
  [Bartha] Judging from views arising from party, the KDNP is 
seeing many conversions. 
  [Surjan] I do not wish to comment on this, either. 
  [Bartha] How are you taking the fact that everyone is now 
blaming the party chairman for everything, for whatever reason? 
  [Surjan] In politics, thinking about changes of personnel is 
natural after failures. I believe that this is how it should 
be. For this reason, the KDNP's leadership and I have also 
announced that we would hand in our resignations at the 
extrordinary national convention. The delegates will then 
decide which leaders' work they will continue to require in the 
future. 
  [Bartha] What do you expect? Will you stay? 
  [Surjan] Similar to the relationship between the president 
of the republic and the prime minister, the position of a 
chairman can also exist alongside a strong executive chairman. 
At least, this is the way I see it. Very many people support 
me, but quite a few believe that I am responsible for 
everything. If the party decides that it needs my knowledge, in 
any position, then I will accept this. If it decides -- as was 
suggested to me by Sandor Keresztes -- that I should vest my 
energies in being a parliamentary deputy, then I will help the 
new party leadership this way. Providing that this new party 
leadership does not shift to the right. The fate of the 
Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only showed that 
letting down the coalition is cowardice, it also showed that, by 
shifting to the right of the KDNP's current policy, one falls 
into an abyss. The MIEP's right-wing policy has minimal support 
of society, and it is dangerous for the country's future. 
  [Bartha] As far as we know, Miklos Gaspar, who is said to be 
one of the leading figures of the radical wing, will also run 
for the position of chairman. 
  [Surjan] I have already said that I will not talk about 
people. 
  [Bartha] Fuzessy indicated that it would be fortunate if the 
KDNP was able continue to provide the ambassador to the Vatican. 
The former prime minister once successfully "exported" the then 
party chairman, Sandor Keresztes, who had criticized the 
coalition and had become inconvenient, to this position. Is it 
possible that you are the next one? 
  [Surjan] It would be good for Hungary and the new government 
if the new Vatican ambassador was a Christian democrat. 
Presumably the coalition of the Hungarian Socialist Party and 
the Alliance of Free Democrats will not deny this request. 
However, I clearly say no to me filling this position. As a 
matter of fact, I know that Fuzessy was not thinking of me when 
he talked about this. 
  [Bartha] There is also talk about setting up a ministry 
dealing with church affairs, under your leadership. 
  [Surjan] Ministerial and state secretarial positions can 
only be filled from within the coalition. At least this is 
natural. Therefore, this is out of the question in this form. 
However, if it operates as a non-governmental organization that 
fulfills concrete tasks then I can easily imagine mainly legally 
trained Christian Democrats in it -- but not me. 
  [Bartha] Another coalition is also often mentioned, namely 
that of the future opposition. In the KDNP, many people fear 
that "the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] still wishes to 
absorb the KDNP." 
  [Surjan] Some MDF politicians still consider this as the 
main goal of their lives. My answer to them and to others: Yes 
for cooperation, no for fusion. The KDNP will be a constructive 
opposition party that has its own image and that has goals.

<F P=106> [Report by Geza Lajos Nagy: "Public Opinion Survey of the </F>
Hungarian Gallup Institute: What Will the Next Four Years 
Bring? -- The Voters of the Socialist Party Are Most Optimistic"] 
  [Text] On 28 and 29 May, the Hungarian Gallup Institute 
carried out a survey of a representative sample of 1,500 people 
of the adult population on people's expectations regarding the 
coming four years. At the time of the survey, the victory by 
the Hungarian Socialist Party in the first round of elections 
was known, and it seemed very likely that, as a governmental 
party, the Socialists would have a determining role in the 
country's life. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the 
replies show what performance people are expecting of the new 
government. 
  The outgoing government "was found wanting" because everyday 
living conditions and the circumstances determining the narrower 
and wider scope of life were unfavorable. The country will 
judge the performance of the government that is being formed and 
the parties that are setting it up in four years' time. As for 
the present, all in all, it can be said that the new government 
is facing serious burdens regarding the population's 
expectations. Whether it is the macroeconomic conditions, 
personal living conditions, or issues affecting the political 
sphere, the majority or people expect as a minimum that the 
situation will not deteriorate. However, as is shown by a 
detailed analysis of the data, it is a -- realistic or 
unrealistic -- desire of many people for conditions better than 
the current conditions to emerge. 
  On the subject of the country's economic situation in the 
next four years, the population's living standards, the 
unemployment rate, the level of inflation, the number of poor 
and rich people, and the financial situation of their own 
family, some one-tenth of people (7-10 percent) cannot choose 
between the positive and negative alternatives offered. Almost 
twice as many or even more people (17-27 percent) cannot or will 
not express their views on the expected changes of the country's 
foreign political relations, the political structure, and the 
freedom of the press in this brief period. 
  If we only look at people who have an opinion and are 
willing 
to express it, we can establish that half (49 percent) of them 
believe that the country's economic situation "will improve" in 
the coming four years. More than one-tenth (14 percent) have an 
opposite view -- "it will deteriorate" -- and more than 
one-third (37 percent) believe that the country's economic 
situation "will remain similar to the current situation." It 
has to be mentioned here that the surveyed people did not select 
the two extreme points of the five- point scale of values -- "it 
will improve significantly," and "it will deteriorate 
significantly." This also applies to the further questions 
that, at the same time, indicate that the expectations, whether 
positive or negative, are moderate. Therefore, the public 
attitude is characterized neither by overt optimism nor by dark 
pessimism. 
  The overall picture is less favorable when people talk about 
the expected living standards of the population. The proportion 
of those who expect the living standards "to remain similar to 
the current one" (41 percent) is almost the same as of those who 
expect improvement (39 percent). One-fifth (20 percent) expect 
a deterioration of living conditions. Therefore, 10 percent 
fewer people expect the improvement of living standards than the 
development of the economy, and 6 percent more people mention 
their deterioration than economic decline. 
  As for the financial situation of the families, the 
proportion of those expecting improvement is even smaller (34 
percent) than the proportion of those who expect a positive 
change in the population's living standards. Half (50 percent) 
of those who replied do not believe in either a positive or a 
negative change, and 16 percent believe that the coming four 
years will bring a negative change in the family's financial 
situation. 
  Therefore, the further away we get from the macro-sphere and 
the closer to people's everyday living conditions, the more 
reserved the expectations become. This is also supported by 
people's views on the expected level of inflation. According to 
a relative majority (42 percent), inflation will be higher than 
the current level in the coming four years, and similar 
proportions (28 percent) hope that the level of inflation will 
"decrease" or that it will "remain similar to the current level." 
  Expectations as regards the economy and unemployment are 
closely related to each other in people's way of thinking. A 
relative majority (45 percent) of people believe that the number 
of unemployed people will decrease in the next four years; 
according to 23 percent, the situation will be the opposite of 
this; and according to 32 percent, the number of unemployed will 
not change. Three times as many (64 percent) of those who 
believe in economic improvement also believe in the reduction of 
unemployment, than those (20 percent) who believe in further 
deterioration of the economy. Conversely, more than half (55 
percent) of the latter, and 10 percent of the former believe 
that the number of the unemployed will exceed the current level 
in the next four years. 
  Although these are cutting issues that directly or 
indirectly 
affect the everyday conditions, people's views are less 
determined by their social situation than by their party 
affiliations. The calculations clearly show this. As an 
example, let us take the expectations regarding the financial 
situation of families and inflation. In both cases, positive 
expectations are more influenced by the fact whether someone had 
voted for the MSZP or the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] than 
by the fact that the person is at the top or bottom -- as 
unemployed -- of the social hierarchy. This "logic" is valid in 
all cases. The voters of the Socialists and -- although more 
moderately -- of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] expect a 
better performance in the next four years than the supporters of 
the Smallholders, Christian Democrats, or the Hungarian 
Democrats. 
  The Gallup survey also touched upon the future size of the 
two opposite ends of society, namely the poor and the rich. The 
same proportions of people (46 and 47 percent) believe that, in 
the next four years, there will be more poor and more rich 
people in the country than currently. However, while 
one-quarter (26 percent) trust that the number of the poor will 
decrease and 28 percent believe it likely that the current 
proportions will remain, 12 percent expect the number of rich 
people to decrease and 41 percent believe that their number will 
not change. 
  Based on the replies given to the two questions, the Gallup 
prepared an indicator that shows how people see the "movement" 
of these two social groups in the future. Accordingly, the 
replies can be placed in three groups. The majority (51 
percent) expect the same kind of movement in the two groups, 
namely either both groups will increase, both will decrease, or 
neither will change. According to the second group (30 percent), 
the number of rich people will increase more than that of the 
poor, and according to the third group (19 percent), the number 
of the poor will increase more than that of the rich. Regarding 
the proportions of the latter two groups among the voters of 
parliamentary parties, it can be established that three times as 
many MSZP voters and twice as many SZDSZ voters expect the 
population to become richer than to become poorer (MSZP: rich 
44, poor 13 percent; SZDSZ: 28 and 13 percent respectively). 
As for the voters of the other parties, the proportions of 
those who expect one or the other group to increase are nearly 
the same. The voters of the Federation of Young Democrats 
[Fidesz] are an exception to this: More (22 percent) of them 
expect the number of poor people to increase than that of the 
rich (16 percent). 
  The public opinion survey only touched on the sphere of 
politics. With the help of a question -- that has been asked 
many times in the past years -- it examined where people place 
Hungary in the dimension of dictatorship and democracy, where 
they think it stood at the end of the 1980's, and where it will 
be in four years' time. A nine-point scale was used where a 1 
meant that the country's political setup is "dictatorial" and a 
9 meant "democratic." 
  Comparing the results of the survey six months ago -- 
October 
1993 -- with the end of May results, no change can be seen as 
regards the future. In October 1993, the average for "now" was 
5.65, and in May 1994 it was 5.61. Both values indicate that 
the country's "current" political system is considered to be 
more democratic than dictatorial. As for the near future, 
people expected further expansion of democracy at both surveys 
(October 6.95, May 6.73). 
  The voters of two parties -- the MSZP and the MDF -- are 
worth mentioning whether we are looking at views on the present 
or the future. As opposed to the stability of views typical of 
the other parties, the voters of these two parties have a more 
positive view of the "present" situation than they did six 
months ago. However, as regards the future, the views of these 
two groups change in the opposite direction. The expectations 
of the MDF supporters have become less favorable -- 7.45 in 
October and 6.36 in May -- and that of the MSZP supporters have 
become more favorable -- it increased from 6.66 to 7.36. Let us 
also note that the Socialist supporters are the only group whose 
expectations for the future changed in a positive direction. 
  People have a less favorable view of the past -- the 
political system of the 1980's -- now (4.23) than six months ago 
(4.78). This applies to all voters, including the Socialists, 
regardless of the party affiliation. However, it also has to be 
seen that the views of the Socialist supporters on the 1980's 
was better both in October (5.45) and in May (4.80), than among 
the voters of other parties. 
  The general tendency that the Socialist voters expect more 
and better in the next four years is also manifest in their 
views on the freedom of the press. According to 41 percent of 
the replies, the freedom of the press will increase in the next 
four years, half (52 percent) do not expect any change, and 7 
percent expect it to be reduced. Six out of 10 MSZP voters (59 
percent) and four out of 10 SZDSZ or Fidesz voters (44 and 43 
percent) expect a positive change in this area. In the other 
camp, two to three people out of 10 hold this view: 17 percent 
of MDF voters, 20 percent of Independent Smallholders Party 
[FKGP] voters, and 29 percent of Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP] voters. 
  During the election campaign, the question of how Hungary's 
foreign relations with the Western and neighboring countries 
will change was raised many times. The results of the survey 
show that an absolute or relative majority of people also expect 
improvement in this area. According to 45 percent of them, the 
country's Western relations will improve in the next four years, 
12 percent believe that they will deteriorate, and four out of 
10 people (43 percent) believe that they will not change. As 
for relations with the neighboring countries, even more people 
expect positive changes. The view of the absolute majority (54 
percent) is that Hungary's relations with the neighboring 
countries will improve, and 7 percent have an opposite view. 
According to the rest of the people (39 percent), no change 
will take place. 
  Whichever aspect we look at, significantly more Socialist 
supporters expect positive changes and a better governmental 
performance than the voters of any other party. This is 
particularly true for our relations with the neighboring 
countries. Almost three-quarters (72 percent) of the MSZP voters 
expect our relations with our neighbors to improve in the next 
four years compared to now. Some 38 percent of the MDF voters 
expect the same.

<F P=106> [Article by Bido Zeqiri: "What Does Mr. Rugova Mean by the </F>
Word `Aggression'?"] 
  [Text] Every patriot and honest Albanian, wherever he 
lives and works, follows with painful concern the events in 
Kosovo, and it seems to us unfounded and illogical when Mr. 
Rugova places all his hopes of liberation on external forces. 
Here is what he said in a recent interview to the newspaper 
REPUBLIKA: "President Clinton and his administration will not 
tolerate conflicts or any Serbian aggression against Kosova." 
We would like to ask Mr. Rugova: What does he mean by 
aggression against Kosova, when the virtual aggression against 
Kosova that was perpetrated long ago in this area still 
mercilessly continues? Is it not aggression when your schools 
are closed, your university is closed, you are dismissed from 
your job, your academy is shut down, and your newspapers, radio 
and television stations, etc., are closed? Is it not aggression 
when the Serbian police, armed to the teeth, conduct 
house-to-house searches, terrorizing the Kosovars, beating them 
up and torturing them without the slightest mercy? Finally, is 
it not aggression when Serbian tanks and guns are patrolling the 
roads of Kosova towns? 
  It is difficult to admit, Mr. Rugova, that the U.S. 
Administration knows nothing about these things. It is also 
very difficult to say that this Administration does not know 
what aggression means. Should we perhaps expect the criminal 
Arkan to put into practice his plan of ejecting 700,000 Kosovars 
from their homeland? 
  It seems to us that in his recent interview, Mr. Rugova 
tried 
to conceal something. When Mrs. Edlira Bucpapaj asked the 
honorable Mr. Rugova about Douglas Hogg's visit to Prishtina, he 
failed to mention that Mr. Hogg called Kosova "Serbian 
territory." 
  Thus, the U.S. Administration is waiting for the Serbs to 
carry out aggression against Kosova when the Serbs are already 
there, and Britain's Mr. Hogg argues that "Kosova must be viewed 
as Serbian territory." The following question then arises: 
What should the Kosovars do? Should they plead with the Serbs 
for mercy?

  [Text] Romanian Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca is to 
leave today for an official visit in the United States at the 
invitation of Defense Secretary William Perry. This is the 
first visit by a Romanian defense minister to the United States 
since 1989 and the second in the history of Romanian-U.S. 
relations after World War II. Tinca made the following 
exclusive statement to Radio Romania Actualitati correspondent 
Nicu Popescu: 
  [Begin Tinca recording] The visit I am to begin today in the 
United States is a very important one for Romanian-U.S. military 
relations and the cooperation between the two countries. It 
would mean a great deal if at least the majority of the goals I 
set for myself -- even if not all of them -- could be achieved 
so that I could return home with the certitude of a genuine 
progress in the Romanian-U.S. relations. 
  I hope I will be able to present as convincingly as possible 
the concrete steps taken by Romania on its way to 
democratization of Romanian society, the stabilization of the 
economic situation, and the increasingly dynamic implementation 
of the economic reform in our country. 
  I also hope that I will be able to convincingly demonstrate 
the clear readiness of the Ministry of National Defense in view 
of carrying out certain specific actions together with the 
United States and with other countries within the Partnership 
for Peace initiative, as well as our readiness for Romanian-U.S. 
cooperation with respect to our efforts to modernize and 
re-equip the Romanian Armed Forces. 
  I hope very much that my visit, and the results it will 
yield, will contribute not solely to the consolidation of our 
country's internal stability, but also to the strengthening of 
the feeling of security in our entire region and, why not, in 
the whole of Europe. 
  I begin this visit with a very strong sense of 
responsibility, but also optimism, having in view the United 
States' increasingly pronounced readiness to further relations 
with Romania and the consensus existing among our political 
forces with respect to the importance of Romania's ties with the 
United States. [end Tinca recording]

  [Text] Today the Senate passed the final form of Article 2 
of the Draft Bill on the Regulation of the Juridical Status of 
Certain Dwellings Which Became the Property of State by 
Nationalization. After debates that lasted many hours and after 
six amendments proposed by the opposition representatives and by 
the special Senate panel had been rejected, eventually they 
passed, by ballot, the amendment proposed by Senator Ion Culcea 
of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. In concordance 
with the text proposed by the senator, Article 2 was adopted in 
the following wording: 
  The persons mentioned by Article 1, that is, the former 
owners or their heirs, are to benefit from restitution in nature 
in the form of regaining their right to property over the 
apartments they currently live in as tenants, while for all 
other apartments they are to be paid damages under the terms of 
Article 12 of this bill. 
  Article 2 was passed by only 60 votes in favor, 15 against, 
and 4 abstentions; that is, the total number of votes was just 
79. This happened because before the article was submitted to 
ballot, the representatives of the opposition, with the 
exception of the Democratic Party senators, walked out of the 
hall. 
  Immediately following this, Senator Alexandru Popoviciof 
PL-93 [Liberal Party '93] explained their gesture by pointing 
out that the opposition cannot associate itself to theft and 
that it decided to definitely withdraw from the discussions on 
the aforementioned draft bill. 
  According to our correspondent, Dan Preda, immediately after 
the opposition senators walked out Omnia Hall [Senate 
headquarters] they met with representatives of the press. Here 
is the declaration that was adopted in the end of that meeting 
and which was sent to us via fax by our correspondent: 
  Considering the fact that today the parliamentary majority 
in 
Senate adopted in principle merely the paying of limited damages 
for the nationalized dwellings or other dwellings that after 6 
March 1945 went into state property under any other form -- 
expropriated, confiscated, or taken by abuse; 
  -- considering that this solution actually represents a 
second and final nationalization; 
  -- considering that this solution violates Romania's 
Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights; 
  -- considering that the ruling coalition has rejected all 
the 
amendments suggested by the opposition, including the ones 
adopted by the [Senate] Commission for Public Administration and 
the Organization of the Territory, as well as other variants to 
those amendments; 
  -- considering that the ruling majority has not accepted the 
proposals of the opposition regarding the social protection of 
the tenants; 
  -- not wishing to be coauthor of such legislative abuse, the 
signatory parties of the present declaration withdraw for good 
from the discussions and vote-taking on the draft Bill on the 
Regulation of the Juridical Status of Certain Dwellings Which 
Became the Property of State by Nationalization. 
  The declaration is hand-signed by representatives of the 
PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party], the UDMR 
[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania], the PAC [Civic 
Alliance Party], the PL-93, and the PNL-CD [National Liberal 
Party-Democratic Convention].

    [Editorial Report] Sofia DUMA in Bulgarian on 4 June 
carries on pages 9 and 10 the text of the approximately 
12,000-word report that Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Supreme 
Council of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), delivered on the 
first day of the 41st BSP Congress in Sofia on 3 June. The 
report, which appears under the heading "Bulgaria Faces a New 
Choice," is "on the political line of the BSP." In his opening 
words, Videnov stresses that the aim of the 41st congress is "to 
initiate a new political line in the party's life -- a line of 
direct commitment of the Socialists to solving the immense 
problems facing Bulgarian society." 
  In his introduction, having noted the unexpected 
difficulties 
of the transition to democracy, Videnov says that "our society 
today faces a new choice: either to allow the present 
uncontrolled state of economic anarchy, rising corruption, and 
gross violation of the law to continue" or "to restore the 
manageability of the economy in combination with the principles 
of free economic initiative." He reiterates the BSP's support 
of the reforms, but says that the strategy followed so far has 
been erroneous, as it was "based on civil confrontation," for 
which the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) carries most of the 
blame. 
  In the first main section of his report, under the 
subheading 
"The BSP in the Institutions of Power," Videnov briefly reviews 
the political developments in the period since the 40th BSP 
Congress in 1991, which began by the SDS and Rights and Freedoms 
Movement (DPS) imposing "an extremist formula of government," 
with the "new SDS nomenklatura" implementing "a 
restorational, repressive, and revanchist policy in parliament, 
the government, the Presidency, local government, the judiciary, 
and the media." This prompted the BSP, "not without certain 
hesitations," to support the Berov nonparty government of 
experts. He admits that the Berov administration has achieved 
only partial success in implementing the reforms, but stresses 
that it "proved sufficiently strong in parliament (and chiefly 
in society) to oppose with a solid majority the SDS claims for 
confrontational, monopolist power based on force." 
  Videnov then turns to the economic crisis, giving figures on 
the drastic fall in production in all spheres since 1989, 
accompanied by falling living standards and inevitable social 
tension. He asks how the social cost of the transition can be 
made bearable for the population and whether "the lost of public 
support for the reforms can be overcome." In seeking answers, 
he states six "principled conclusions and lessons": First, "any 
reform program in the socioeconomic sphere is doomed to failure 
without broad public support"; second, "the sharp political 
confrontation and primitive politicizing of economic problems 
paralyze the work of the institutions and block the necessary 
structural changes"; third, the crisis cannot be resolved 
"through measures of a monetary nature, especially in shock 
form"; fourth, the transition from a centralized to a market 
economy must be carried out "gradually and following the 
principle of continuity"; fifth, during the crisis, when most 
property and means of production are still state owned, "the 
state cannot abdicate from its obligation to regulate and adjust 
the economic processes"; and sixth, "the entire potential of the 
nation must be mobilized to find a new philosophy for the 
economic reform, one most suited to the specific conditions in 
Bulgaria." However, Videnov fails to propose any specific 
solutions to the current economic problems, confining himself to 
generalities such as: "Without a clear strategy for 
restructuring a considerable number of large enterprises that 
will remain in state ownership in the future, it is impossible 
to successfully privatize the rest." 
  In the next section of his report, subheaded "The Present 
Political Crisis and Its Solution Through Elections," the BSP 
leader reviews the party's consistent attempts to seek political 
dialogue with other parties to agree on "urgently required 
measures in the socioeconomic sphere." However, he admits that 
the attempts of the BSP and Prime Minister Berov to reach such 
an agreement between the parliamentary groups have been 
rebuffed. Accordingly, Videnov states, "the BSP Supreme Council 
has decided to turn to you, the delegates to the 41st BSP 
Congress, with the proposal that you should direct the 
activities of the BSP toward holding early parliamentary 
elections in October or November this year, so as to realize a 
major change in the method of implementing the transition in 
Bulgaria." He assures the delegates that the elections will 
mean "the rejection of the shock model for the transition, a 
clear left-of-center future for Bulgaria... and a clearly 
defined political configuration capable of giving Bulgaria the 
competent, stable, efficient, government of dialogue that it 
needs." Although he admits that to press for early elections 
involves certain risks for the BSP, he sees no other solution to 
the present political impasse in parliament. He adds that "this 
conclusion is also imposed by the grave political situation in 
the country, for which homegrown politickers and wheeler-dealers 
are to blame." He notes that many of those who have caused the 
crisis "are accumulating dirty financial and political dividends 
from the difficulties of the crisis." Finally, Videnov sees 
elections as the way to avoid "additional severe socioeconomic 
risks -- hyperinflation, devaluation of the lev, series of 
bankruptcies, and the failure of the budget." 
  Videnov then proceeds to propose "a change in the model for 
the transition." He points out that "the people have every 
reason to insist that the social cost of the transition is 
bearable" and that "a strong modern left party is needed to 
ensure this." In contrast, "the Bulgarian right wing today is 
dominated by radical trends that, under the guise of 
ultraliberal slogans, are imposing restorational, authoritarian, 
and anarchistic views of the transition." 
  In the section of his report subheaded "On a New 
Socioeconomic Policy," Videnov first reiterates that "the BSP 
supports building a democratic society based on a social market 
economy." He then lists the main points in the Socialists' 
socioeconomic program: 
  First, "Bulgarian production is top priority"; 
  Second, "acceleration of the privatization process," 
promoting "shareholding forms of market privatization, which 
presupposes the speedy consolidation and development of the 
exchange markets in securities," including promoting "the 
purchase of enterprises by workers' collectives," in addition to 
"the existing preferences accorded to employees in enterprises 
undergoing privatization"; 
  Third, "realism in agrarian policy," combating the 
fragmentation of farmland ownership by encouraging the formation 
of "voluntarily organized cooperatives, and following the 
worldwide practice of subsidizing agricultural production to 
maintain its viability"; 
  Fourth, "financial and foreign exchange stabilization," with 
emphasis placed "on increasing budget expenditure on direct 
investments and preferences for private entrepreneurs with a 
view to promoting eventual rises in budget revenue," "finally 
settling the problem of enterprises bad debts," and avoiding 
"the present tendency to increasingly tie up our financial 
balances by taking new loans from foreign sources"; and 
  Fifth, "an export orientation of the Bulgarian economy and 
achieving a positive balance of trade," by such measures as 
"moderate and selective protectionism of our internal market" to 
give producers the necessary breathing space to become 
competitive in the world market; Videnov points out that foreign 
capital, though welcome, "can play only an ancillary role and 
will come to Bulgaria only when the market situation in Bulgaria 
guarantees sufficient profitability." 
  In the section on social policy, Videnov attacks the "shock 
therapy and the liberal model of the reform that is completely 
inadequate for Bulgaria and has reduced most of society to 
poverty." He says that "the state is called upon to make 
adjustments to the market mechanisms... to guarantee a certain 
distribution and redistribution of the national income." He 
advocates measures against "the price speculation that is 
greatly contributing to the decline in the population's 
purchasing power." The BSP's "active investment policy will 
help to create new jobs in all spheres," Videnov says. He also 
promises proper compensation for pensioners and supports the 
establishment of independent pension funds and help for families 
and children. 
  The next section of the report is entitled "The Political 
System of Society -- Toward Restoration or Modernization?" 
Videnov notes that "for Bulgaria, the `velvet resolution' of 
1989 proved to be a step backward because it returned the 
country to the doomed confrontational models of the past." 
"Today," he says, "most Bulgarian parties consist of coteries 
without a social basis that are not representative and have no 
sense of responsibility." Videnov claims that the political 
system should include the following seven elements: "social 
democracy as the basis of the new politics"; "decentralization 
and self-government"; "socialization in economic life," 
including "a decisive decentralization of ownership sand its 
just distribution and social privatization" that "puts a great 
part of the social production funds in the hands of their 
creators"; following a "responsible left policy" to prevent the 
risk of the restoration of authoritarianism; "a radical reform 
of the legal system"; "democratization of the media"; and equal 
social access to culture. 
  In the section entitled "BSP -- a New Party," Videnov 
considers the changes that have occurred and are still taking 
place in the BSP. He summarizes the main ideas that now guide 
the party activities as follows: 
  1. "The BSP does not regard power as an aim in itself but as 
a means for developing a free, just, and cohesive society." 
Videnov claims that the Socialists realize that "power does not 
oppose the civic society but supports its manifestations and 
protects the social, intellectual, and economic autonomy of the 
individual...." 
  2. The BSP is a firm supporter of the parliamentary system, 
and its "indisputable feature is deep respect for the 
Constitution and the laws, its political partners and opponents, 
and readiness to conduct an open and equal dialogue with all 
political formations...." 
  3. The BSP remains a party of the masses. 
  4. Replacement of leaders. Videnov draws attention to "the 
complete replacement of leading figures in the BSP in recent 
years, and the radical renewal of the leading organs, ranging 
from the municipal organizations to the Supreme Council." 
  5. Democratization of the BSP. Videnov claims that "the BSP 
today can convincingly be assessed as a party with developed and 
expanding democratic principles within itself and as a party of 
active pluralism of ideas." 
  In the penultimate section of his report, Videnov dwells at 
length on the continuous intense ideological debate that has 
taken place within the party since the 40th congress, claiming 
that it serves as proof of the party's vitality and democratic 
nature and noting that despite sharp debates on the various 
draft versions of the new BSP program, the party has managed to 
preserve its unity. 
  In conclusion, Videnov notes that "in the face of the 
antisocialist propaganda campaign, relying on insinuations, 
lies, and manipulations, the BSP counters by offering its own 
honest analysis and sincere desire for change." He calls upon 
the party "before the crucial elections, to strive to develop 
its potential for social dialogue." "We have the moral 
strength," he says, "and we have political grounds to seek a new 
public vote of confidence, so as to assume our national 
responsibilities."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Videnov's Feint Will Be Assessed </F>
in Fall"] 
  [Text] Formally, the 41st Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
Congress ended according to expectations. 
  Zhan Videnov was reelected. The adoption of the program was 
postponed and subjected to a party referendum -- as the chairman 
demanded. The congress announced a course toward new elections. 
  However, unlike previous forums, events that ostensibly did 
not occur at the congress prompt the observers to conclude that 
nevertheless, something happened in the BSP. The personnel 
changes were the most insignificant development. 
  According to the forecasts the greatest battle at the 
congress should have taken place in anything related to the 
election of the BSP Supreme Council. No major changes were 
anticipated. However, Andrey Lukanov, Dimitur Yonchev, Rosen 
Karadimov, and Elena Poptodorova surprisingly were not elected 
to this organ. 
  However, the most improbable development was the failure of 
Aleksandur Marinov, seen as the probable next party leader, to 
gain election to the Supreme Council. He was supported by the 
BSP Sofia city organization and Aleksandur Lilov himself. 
However, Marinov could not even qualify as a contender for the 
post of BSP leader. 
  Thus the coup at the top of the party that was planned, did 
not take place. According to the laws of the party hierarchy, 
from now on the process will follow the domino rule -- other 
people will also have to leave the higher floors of the building 
on Positano Street [the BSP headquarters]. 
  It was in the issue of the party program that Videnov's 
victory became obvious. 
  The party chief strategist [Aleksandur Lilov] was burdened 
by 
his program. This was not a strategic burden. He clearly had no 
direct commitment to the party leadership. However, isolated in 
his strategic center, he composed a program that he saw as 
certain to be adopted at the congress. Surprising or not, Zhan 
Videnov convincingly defended his position during the debate and 
in the final analysis he achieved what he wanted -- the BSP 
program will be adopted not by the congress but by a party 
referendum. 
  To be able to assess this victory of Videnov on merit one 
should know that Lilov's center worked for two years on its 
variant of the program and thought that there would be no 
competition. However, two additional competitors appeared -- 
the draft programs of the Alliance for Social Democracy and the 
hardliners of the "Marxist Alternative." 
  However, at the referendum the party members will not be 
asked to select one of the three drafts. They will actually vote 
on Lilov's program, which will be amended and supplemented. It 
is assumed that the amendments will include the elimination of 
the democratic socialism line, proposed by the strategist. Thus 
Videnov, who opposes this formula, will achieve another victory. 
  There is an additional goal behind all this. When Zhan 
Videnov imposed the decision on the referendum his secret 
intention was related to preparing the BSP position at the next 
elections. The people around him clearly hinted that the concept 
of democratic socialism stinks and scares the potential allies 
of the BSP in a preelection and postelection coalition. 
  The talks with Petur Dertliev's Social Democrats are at an 
advanced phase. However, one of the conditions of forming the 
partnership is very categorical -- the Socialists should 
relinquish Lilov's yearnings, and declare themselves Social 
Democrats. 
  Videnov's feint in delaying his reply to this demand could 
turn out to be rather prudent. However, this will become clear 
only at the next elections. 
  The BSP Congress approved the idea of holding early 
parliamentary elections in the fall. This was not by accident 
and is not a meaningless demonstration on the party of Videnov. 
He wants the elections and has his reasons. The BSP leader 
firmly declared that this parliament had exhausted its 
possibilities. However, his secret concern is related to new 
changes at the National Assembly, which could be uncomfortable 
for the Socialists. If Lyuben Berov remains in power, the chance 
of the anticommunist majority in the parliament to organize 
itself and form a new cabinet improves. 
  In addition Videnov is convinced that, if the elections take 
place in the fall, the BSP will win them. 
  Nevertheless, the BSP parliamentary faction does not 
unequivocally accept the idea of new elections. Nora Ananieva 
[leader of the BSP parliamentary faction] pretended that she was 
joking when she said at the congress that fall ends on 22 
December. Despite the fact that the Socialists unanimously 
declare their wish to hold new elections, not all of them want 
to risk their seats in the parliament. 
  The problem of the Socialists' leader is whether the Union 
of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] really wants new elections, as it has 
claimed for a long time, or whether this is a strategic maneuver 
of the SDS center. The concern grew even more when the SDS 
National Coordinating Council praised the BSP for finally 
adopting the idea the SDS constantly promotes. The SDS became 
even more suspicious after the scandal between Filip Dimitrov 
and Stefan Savov, which could possibly lead toward preserving 
the parliament. 
  Difficult times lie ahead for the BSP. Lukanov, who appeared 
to be a permanent fixture, is outside the supreme leadership. 
Lilov obviously suffered a defeat. However, will all this be 
enough to convince the voters that the BSP is not the Bulgarian 
Communist Party any longer?

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Lilov, leader of the BSP </F>
Strategic Research Center, by Todor Tokin; place and date not 
given: "Tribal Political Animosity Could Produce Grave 
Consequences for Country"] 
  [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Lilov, how do you assess the 41st 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Congress? 
  [Lilov] This is a successful congress. The party's 
political line is being clarified. I mean the main aspects of 
this line -- elections, working out a practical policy, adopting 
a long-range program, and continuing the renewal of the party. 
I think that those steps are in the correct direction and that 
this predetermined the congress' success. 
  [Tokin] The congress decided that the program prepared by 
your Strategic Research Center will serve as the basis of the 
party program. However, its adoption was postponed by three 
months. How do you assess this move? 
  [Lilov] The most important things for me are that first, the 
draft of the strategic center was adopted as the basis of the 
party program, and second, that it was decided to incorporate in 
our draft the most valuable elements of the precongressional 
discussion and the other drafts published and discussed by the 
party. The final form of the adoption is not fatal. However, a 
negative effect will emerge if again requests and intentions are 
voiced, which could prevent the adoption of the program either 
directly or by infringing upon its basic ideas. I would not 
like to think that the next three months will be utilized for 
wasting time or directing the program's elaborations in an 
incorrect direction. 
  [Tokin] How do you assess the election platform proposed by 
Zhan Videnov, BSP chairman? 
  [Lilov] I assess very highly the idea of the party chairman, 
but the program itself is rather raw. In addition, I think that 
we need a program of a different type. At the congress I said 
that the election platform should not specify what the BSP 
proposes for the 21st century, but should say plainly to the 
Bulgarian voters what the party is proposing for the 1994-98 
period, which is relevant to those elections. The BSP must 
propose a new, very clear, specific, pragmatic, and programmatic 
policy in all areas. 
  [Tokin] Do you think that your line was defeated at the 
congress, as the rumors in the corridors point out? 
  [Lilov] (Laughing) Yes, the corridors produced this thesis 
about a defeat or a victory.... I do not think that this is so. 
However, even if this is so, no one knows what he won, whom did 
he defeat, and whether he lost something by being defeated. 
  [Tokin] Do you see yourself as DUMA chief editor? There was 
such a proposal. 
  [Lilov] Oh please! This is an inappropriate proposal. 
  [Tokin] Do you not think that the BSP missed the best moment 
for the elections? 
  [Lilov] This is a serious question. The strong policy and 
the strong party that implements this policy could be identified 
through many signs. One of them is the selection of the right 
moment for its actions. Our party must select that moment for 
the elections, which will be the most suitable one for the 
country and for the policy that our party proposes. Therefore I 
think that we discovered the concept "elections" only after an 
excessively long and unjustified searching. We are late, 
because most of the political factors in Bulgaria already 
invoked this concept. However, I do not think that the BSP 
missed this train. If the party proposes a good tactical policy 
it has a chance. Elections in the fall could be successful for 
the BSP if the party produces a good policy. 
  [Tokin] However, Professor Kyuranov said that if the BSP 
selects the road of toppling Prof. Berov's cabinet, the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] could easily form a new government and 
restore the old parliamentary majority, through which it could 
rule until the end of 1995. 
  [Lilov] The people in Bulgaria must get used to the rules of 
democracy. This factor that according to the laws and the rules 
of democracy has the right and ability to form a government, can 
indeed do so. Prof. Kyuranov cannot guarantee the BSP or the 
leftist forces that if we constantly postpone the elections and 
support a government which is losing credit, then what he fears 
will not materialize. The issue is to conduct democratic and 
free elections and form a high-quality parliament and strong 
government in accordance with the wishes of the voters. We do 
not need behind-the-scenes combinations and should not fear 
elections. 
  [Tokin] Why do you not mention specific political factors 
in your idea regarding a leftist-centrist agreement, which is 
incorporated in the center's program? 
  [Lilov] It is the specific political market that will 
propose specific political factors. This will happen when the 
political scene becomes clear and one can see what election 
platforms and forces emerge. If a postelection leftist-centrist 
coalition is concerned, then one must see the situation in the 
parliament after the elections. I have absolutely no dramatic 
concern that the BSP could remain alone without partners. If it 
succeeds to receive a solid majority in the parliament the 
chances and possibilities of forming a leftist-centrist 
coalition in the parliament will grow. This is a very clear and 
promising idea. If this chance is missed, I think that we will 
commit a grave error, which will not be applauded in any way by 
history or the present and future generations. 
  [Tokin] You said that you relinquish all party posts. Does 
this mean that you also relinquish the leadership of the 
Strategic Research Center? 
  [Lilov] This is absolutely sincere. If I wanted the 
leadership post I could have it without any difficulties. As 
far as the strategic center is concerned -- this is not a party 
post. There are no political appointments in science. 
  [Tokin] Your colleagues reproach you for not mentioning Zhan 
Videnov when you speak about the party's new face. According to 
you, who are the capable persons in the BSP? 
  [Lilov] Those are concocted accusations. Infighting is one 
of our party's bad traditions. 
  I see Zhan Videnov's face among the new faces of our party, 
but I want to stress that the party's elite does not consist 
only of the posts in its leadership. We have certain 
differences with the party leader regarding certain issues, but 
I do not wish to dramatize them. I think that the party leader 
must be independent. If Zhan Videnov obtains this independence 
I will be the happiest member of the party. 
  Yanaki Stoilov is one of the most gifted persons in the 
party. Aleksandur Marinov, Nikolay Kamov, and many other young 
people are the hope of our party. I am glad that at such a 
difficult moment the party can show so many new and promising 
faces. 
  [Tokin] What are the main differences between the BSP and 
the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party [BSDP]? 
  [Lilov] We have no profound programmatic differences. While 
some of the BSDP leaders do not like this, it nevertheless is a 
positive factor in relations between the two parties and a 
wonderful prerequisite of developing cooperation. The 
differences are the result of the still existing historical 
heritage and the failure to develop a sufficiently active and 
constructive dialogue. 
  [Tokin] What party will the BSP present at the elections? 
Whose party will it be? 
  [Lilov] The BSP will present in the elections a party that 
very seriously wants to eliminate the tribal political animosity 
which exists in Bulgaria, and which could have grave 
consequences for our country. The BSP must place national 
consensus and interests above everything else. Afterward, the 
BSP must propose another alternative for the reforms in the 
country. It should do so not in order to stop the reforms, but 
in order to give them a new impulse and provide them with a new 
leftist-centrist philosophy and program. Finally, the BSP must 
express and protect the interests of that majority of the 
population which is subjected to mass impoverishment, while 
keeping in mind its role in our society. 
  [Tokin] Do you think that the leftist wave that began in 
Lithuania and continued through Poland and Hungary, will reach 
Bulgaria tomorrow? 
  [Lilov] There is no other way. We are in the way of this 
wave.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Prodev: "Two Days After Congress"] </F>
  [Text] Rather than three days, the Bulgarian Socialist 
Party [BSP] Congress lasted four days and one night. This was 
not because so many of the delegates wanted to speak, but 
because of purely organizational reasons. It turned out that we 
still do not know the real price of time. Time costs money, 
which does not grow on trees. 
  The congress was awaited with interest by our entire public 
and was accompanied by many forecasts. Unfortunately, the 
forecasts were made by amateurs, and not a single one turned out 
to be true. As so many times in the past, it again became clear 
that our political prophets are not interested in the truth 
about the BSP, but in their own notions about it. This causes 
them to deceive themselves, which is not only confusing, but 
almost evokes ridicule. If one reads their forecasts one sees 
that their preliminary expectations have nothing in common with 
the facts. Again most of the journalists, political scientists, 
and observers showed that bias and personal feelings are only an 
elementary propaganda game with the real situation. None of 
them succeeded in forecasting what would happen at the congress, 
and thus distinguish himself. 
  The 41st BSP Congress provided a number of "surprises," 
which 
if sensed before the congress, could have been a case of serious 
political intelligence. I will not dwell on all the surprises, 
but will point out only two that deserve special attention. 
  The first was the fact that the expected personal and 
ideological duels did not take place, although they were implied 
in some of the statements. In this context the expected split 
or great differences in assessments proved to be a bluff. The 
congress' energy was not wasted on imposing someone's will or 
settling accounts. The delegates not only showed prudence, but 
they also did not allow anyone to impose his will for his own 
ends. This was not the result of weariness, feebleness, or 
fear, but of a most serious attitude toward the problems. It 
became quite clear that the factors that divide the party are 
much weaker at present than the factors that unite it. Even the 
strongest words from the rostrum and the most nervous scuffle 
near the microphones did not confuse the congress' general 
atmosphere. On the contrary, the atmosphere was businesslike and 
influenced by the results, not by selfish and vain struggles. 
Even those persons from whom great thunder was expected did not 
violate the rules of good taste. This is more than indicative 
for a political congress taking place in the present social 
situation, torn apart by explosions. It became more than 
obvious that the Socialists can think bitter thoughts, but do 
not seek success through scandals. There were indeed attempts 
to create scandals, but the initiators did not find any support. 
The congress quickly quashed such attempts, sometimes with 
derision, and showed that it thinks on a grand scale and rejects 
petty ambitions. This is what the political prophets were not 
able to forecast. They expected a storm perhaps even 
catastrophic clashes, but instead of this they saw a complex but 
fruitful dialogue. The BSP again proved that unlike its 
political opponents, it is a party with sound nerves and a clear 
voice. 
  The second serious surprise of the 41st BSP Congress 
involved 
the election of its top leadership. For a long time the press 
and the radio toyed with various names, pointed out ideological 
currents, sought heroes and victims, and tried to forecast a 
conflict of personal and group interests. Today the election is 
already a fact and all this does not sound serious. Almost all 
the great figures in the BSP, with a few exceptions, found their 
place on the BSP Supreme Council. Only a few of them, who 
either evoke concern with their behavior, or express radical and 
unacceptable positions, were not elected. I personally regret 
the fact that some of them were not elected, but this does not 
change anything. The election sense of the delegates proved to 
be quite precise. The delegates refused to give their 
confidence mostly to people who did not convince the congress 
that they were selfless in their ambitions, and that they 
profess sober views. 
  Of course, this does not mean that controversial persons, 
people associated with the old notions of party behavior, and 
people who still have a leadership mania did not enter the BSP 
Supreme Council. Despite this, however, the result is positive. 
The delegates voted according to their conscience and generally 
elected a leadership that corresponds to the current BSP 
interests. It is a leadership of balance, professional thought, 
and a useful combination of the center and the ideological 
currents. This is a hope that could produce positive results. 
Those who were not elected are certainly disappointed, but if 
they are politicians, they must draw the necessary conclusions. 
At the present political moment the party does not want and 
cannot be subjected to a test by controversial persons and 
extremist views. It faces serious social battles and needs a 
prudently composed leadership that will guarantee a complete 
balance. I would like to believe that, despite the forecasts, 
precisely this is what the new Supreme Council will do. 
  As usual, various gossip accompanied the congress, or was 
spread afterward. Now that the forecasts have been proved wrong 
it is the time of the lies. One of them is more than bankrupt. 
I mean the BTA report, quoted by certain media, according to 
which I was jeered by the delegates because of a report in DUMA 
that ostensibly attempted to suggest Zhan Videnov's election 
prior to the actual vote. This is a pitiful forgery. The truth 
is that the congress jeered not DUMA's chief editor, but a small 
group of delegates from Sofia who made use of the report in 
order to compromise the newspaper and the party leader before 
the election. By the way, this unworthy act had a decisive role 
in the fact that Aleksandur Marinov was not elected a member of 
the Supreme Council. There were other similar lies, but let us 
not pay any attention to them. Whoever wants to know about them 
should read DEMOKRATSIYA. This newspaper presented what 
happened at the congress in such a twisted manner that one can 
only laugh. 
  The 41st BSP Congress will go down in party history as a 
useful congress. It adopted a new charter and election 
platform, and cleared the way for for the new party program 
finally to be adopted. What was very important -- the congress 
confirmed the decision to hold early parliamentary elections. 
Now life should prove the correctness of the party's collective 
mind. This can happen only if the congress' ideas successful 
merge with the requirements of our time, and if each of us, 
Socialists and supporters alike, accept them as our own ideas. 
Let no one become the victim of excessive suspicion or 
inappropriate confidence. Both suspicion and confidence are 
more than harmful, especially at a time such as the present, 
when the BSP's opponents are becoming ever more confused and 
malicious. We are yet to face the struggle for the new 
parliament, which means a struggle for power that will require 
all our strength. In this sphere things are extremely clear and 
cannot be subjected to any games. It depends on us, rather than 
anyone else, whether the people will believe us and will give us 
their confidence. Therefore, the congress' decisions must 
become the destiny of all those who want to help Bulgaria. It 
was no accident that most the statement read at the congress 
referred to the future. The real chance of our nation lies 
somewhere in the future. Let us devote everything we have as 
Socialists and patriots to this chance. Only thus will we be 
able to prove that we are ready for the great public role that 
awaits us.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Ivaylo Kutov: "Congress of Camouflage"] </F>
  [Text] The latest congress of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party] confirmed that the Socialists are still afraid of the 
political responsibilities of the time. The declaration of their 
intention to go for elections in the fall is nothing more than a 
scrap of paper, at the very least, because it does not envisage 
any procedure or compelling force to make them overthrow the 
Berov government in the autumn so as to provoke the elections. 
  The BSP top leadership also pretends it is disturbed by the 
status quo and that it has set course for elections. These are 
mere empty phrases, nothing more. At present, it is very 
convenient for the Communists to rule without bearing any direct 
responsibility. Someone may say that, following the events in 
Poland and Hungary, they may have hopes of winning 
independently. Even if something of the kind occurs, which I do 
not believe for one moment, they will not know what to do with 
the power when they get it. The new geopolitical situation 
forces them to operate in the conditions of a pluralist 
democracy. Even in Brezhnev's time, the Polish and Hungarian 
Communists were more accustomed to working in an environment 
containing elements of dialogue, with the organic necessity of 
stating the reasons for their decisions and actions to their own 
people and the civilized democracies. For this reason, the 
successors of the Polish and Hungarian Communists have some 
experience of working in conditions of dialogue and competition. 
  Our BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party] was a foreign branch of 
the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet Union]. It never made 
an independent decision, either mechanically carrying out 
Moscow's directives or imitating, in an inimitable way, the 
decisions of the CPSU. 
  This is why the present BSP top leadership is well aware 
that 
as the party in power, the only thing that will happen is that 
it will finally expose itself for what it is. In any case, they 
will lose the next elections. Even if they should by chance win 
something, they will not know what to do with it.

  [Text] Yesterday, President Lech Walesa appointed Henryk 
Goryszewski to the posts of secretary of state and head of the 
National Security Bureau [BBN]. Earlier, he accepted the 
resignation of Jerzy Milewski, who has, however, retained his 
post as deputy defense minister. 
  Henryk Goryszewski started his political career as a 
Christian National Union [ZChN] deputy in the first 
democratically elected Sejm. In Hanna Suchocka's government, he 
was deputy prime minister as well as ZChN deputy chairman. 
After the fall of Suchocka's Cabinet, he left the ZChN 
leadership and retired from political life. Henryk Goryszewski 
told a reporter from the Polish radio "Signals of the Day" that 
he does not intend to introduce radical changes at the BBN: 
  [Begin Goryszewski recording] I have great respect for the 
achievements of the BBN so far, when the bureau was managed by 
Minister Milewski. For this reason, it would definitely be 
premature to talk about any changes in the way the bureau works. 
Of course, like Minister Milewski, I shall be modifying the 
ways in which the bureau works, its procedures, when the need 
for such modification arises. In a way, this will occur in 
response to changing needs. 
  I have always attempted to be a flexible politician. People 
view me as a pragmatist. [end recording]

  [Text] Warsaw, 14 Jun (PAP)--In Warsaw today, National 
Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk and Wieslaw Walendziak, 
chairman of Polish Television SA [joint-stock company], signed 
an agreement on cooperation in the production and broadcasting 
of television programs on defense and military issues. Military 
programs are to become more attractive. 
  Kolodziejczyk told journalists that the agreement will 
enable 
the presentation of issues related to the Army "in a flexible 
way and in response to need, and not according to a rigid 
schedule." He added: "I think that a battle for television 
slots is a misunderstanding." 
  Walendziak explained that military programs will be produced 
with "technological contribution from the Army". He said: "I am 
pleased about the agreement because there has been a lot of 
discussion recently about whether television is willing to 
cooperate with state institutions. Of course, it is willing, 
provided these institutions clearly express their expectations. 
The Ministry of National Defense is the first ministry to say 
very clearly what hopes it attaches to cooperation with 
television, and which has not tried to do this in a dictatorial 
manner," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Donald Tusk, Union of Freedom deputy </F>
chairman, by correspondent Katarzyna Janowska; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] [Janowska] Do you believe there is a real chance 
for a true unification within the Union of Freedom's Krakow 
organization? After all, it is public knowledge that there is 
no love lost between the Liberals [Liberal Democratic Congress, 
KLD] and Unionists [Democratic Union, UD] in Krakow.... 
  [Tusk] If it were just a question of feelings and emotions, 
my presence here would not change anything at all. You cannot 
influence the way people feel about one another. 
  [Janowska] But we are not talking about feelings: We are 
talking about political facts. As recently as a few weeks ago, 
UD and KLD activists in Krakow fought each other over the 
influence each group wanted to wield in local self-government 
structures over questions of economic policy. Now, with the 
drafting of the joint list of candidates for positions in local 
self-government, the UD candidates were forced to give way to 
the Liberals, which was not conducive to promoting good 
relations between the two groups. 
  [Tusk] This phenomenon is not restricted exclusively to 
Krakow. Problems with integration within the Union of Freedom 
occur throughout Poland because, as we know, the two groups 
involved have often followed very different paths. We assumed 
from the very beginning that, owing to the frequency and 
intensity of contacts and a different level of conflicts, we 
would achieve the optimum consensus at the top--that is, in 
Warsaw--sooner than anywhere else. This assumption has proved 
correct. On the other hand, sparks tend to fly more often in 
local circles because of their past experience with local 
self-government affairs or because of personal considerations. 
However, I would prefer not to overestimate their significance. 
  [Janowska] Nevertheless, some local KLD activists claim 
that, fearing that they might disappear from the political 
stage, Messrs. Tusk and Bielecki have secured for themselves 
positions in the larger party. 
  [Tusk] Of course, you have the right to form any opinion or 
arrive at any interpretation, especially when it comes to 
individual motives. However, we are bound by the party 
discipline, which obliges us to reason and act in unison. 
During the congress at which we decided on joining forces with 
UD, there were only a handful of votes--out of the total of 300 
delegates--from abstainers or adversaries of the unification 
proposal. Liberals from all over the country decided to join 
forces with the Democratic Union and form a single party by a 
proportion of about 99 to 1. The subsequent presence and active 
participation of the Liberals during the unification congress 
confirmed this decision unequivocally. 
  In addition, Krzysztof Bielecki, who holds the post of a 
high-ranking bank official in London, did not particularly 
depend on the outcome of the unification congress. In fact, 
neither did I--and it could even be said that I lost out by it 
because I had to give up the attractive position of party 
chairman in the process. 
  [Janowska] But, instead, you gained the post of deputy 
chairman of a larger party, which actually commands seats in 
parliament. 
  [Tusk] Even so, I do not automatically gain access to 
parliament by becoming a member of the Union of Freedom party. I 
believe that, contrary to the charges that have been brought 
against me, the conjunction with UD opens up the field for the 
activity of several thousand activists of the former KLD, who 
would otherwise have remained on the margins of political life. 
After all, the Liberals did not have any realistic chances of 
an independent victory in the local election anywhere apart from 
the Tri-City [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot]. 
  [Janowska] Are you not afraid that the unification may 
increase the already considerable distance between the former 
KLD's central authorities and its local representatives? 
  [Tusk] At the moment, my priority is to ensure the 
effectiveness of Union of Freedom policies rather than the 
comfortable situation of its members. Anyone who fails to tune 
in to the theme of our new music--that is, the construction of a 
new, strong party that will win the coming elections--will lose 
out in the party contest. Nevertheless, I am still moderately 
optimistic as regards the future, which also goes for the Krakow 
troubles. Everybody should be given time to readjust. 
  [Janowska] Does this end to the rivalry between the 
activists of the two former parties mean that the KLD will 
ultimately merge into UD? 
  [Tusk] I would be happiest if it meant that the former 
Congress and the former Union merge equally into the Union of 
Freedom. However, we cannot pretend that things are different 
from what they really are, and so we must accept that the former 
UD leaders will continue to play a leading role in places where 
the former UD was particularly strong. All the same, I do not 
regard this as a great problem, especially in Krakow, where the 
former UD circles were more akin to the KLD circles than they 
were in, say, Warsaw. I am inclined to treat the conjunction of 
UD and the KLD not as a union between two political parties but 
as a rapprochement between two separate tendencies that proved 
capable of pursuing the same philosophy on a number of issues. 
I trust that there will be no instances, either in Poland at 
large or, specifically, in Krakow, whereby either of these 
formerly separate tendencies refuses to participate actively in 
the life of the new party. On the other hand, it could happen 
that individual political figures will experience difficulty in 
carving a place for themselves within that new reality. But 
that is something that cannot be helped. 
  [Janowska] How long will we have to wait for the actual, 
practical unification? 
  [Tusk] During the unification congress we held in April, we 
allowed a year for that. The next national congress of the 
Union of Freedom will be preceded by a truly democratic internal 
party election. By April of next year, we will be able to say 
that the intraparty hierarchy has been determined according to 
the wishes of all Union of Freedom members. 
  [Janowska] When will the Union of Freedom nominate its 
presidential candidate? We have already heard certain names 
being mentioned--such as Jacek Kuron, Leszek Balcerowicz, and 
Professor Andrzej Zoll. 
  [Tusk] There is no need to nominate our candidate to the 
office of president today or even tomorrow. However, the Union 
of Freedom must begin to get used to the thought that it might 
be best to name a candidate representing several tendencies. I 
hope that the all-Poland congress of the Union of Freedom, 
scheduled for the spring of next year, will mark the moment of 
the official nomination of our candidate. For the time being, 
all speculation as to his name must remain just speculation.

    [Editorial Report] Several recent Polish newspaper items 
have described and commented on the rise of organized crime in 
Poland and its involvement in the international narcotics trade. 
<H5>  Criminal Gangs </H5>
  An editorial in the 28 April Warsaw daily POLSKA ZBROJNA 
complained of the increasing involvement of organized "gangs" in 
large-scale auto-theft, money-laundering, and drug-trafficking 
operations. The paper stated that these criminals, who are 
reportedly equipped with high-tech communications systems and 
fast cars that have no trouble in outrunning police cruisers, 
are able to use the profits from their criminal activities to 
thwart the criminal justice system: "Even if the police succeed 
in arresting a member of one of these gangs, highly qualified 
and generously paid lawyers get him out in 48 hours. Bail is 
paid immediately. The events described in the press every day 
confirm the rumors about corruption in the police department, 
the public prosecutor's office, and the courts." Frequent 
violent clashes between rival gangs have led the police to 
predict that "in the next few years, on the streets of our 
cities, one will be able to see scenes as depicted in the U.S. 
gangster films of the 1930's." 
<H5>  Polish "Mafia" </H5>
  A 19 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY article entitled "How a Mafia Is 
Born" noted that, while Polish authorities reject the use of the 
term "Mafia" for Polish gangs, there are "well-organized gangs" 
that control prostitution, extort protection money from 
legitimate businesses, smuggle drugs on a large scale, and have 
infiltrated the criminal justice system. According to the 
Warsaw daily, the three main gangs are named "Pruszkow," 
"Ozarow," and "Wolomind" after districts of the Polish capital. 
Increasingly violent "turf" wars are said to have included the 
use of military.weapons, including hand grenades. 
<H5>  Police Powers Limited </H5>
  Journalist Ireneusz Krzeminski has traced the rise of 
organized crime to the limitations placed on police authority 
and procedures since 1989 by successive democratic governments. 
Writing in the 8 May RZECZPOSP0LITA, Krzeminski asserted that 
the new restrictions have demoralized the police and made them 
reluctant to take action, while, at the same time, emboldening a 
criminal element used to the harsh repressive measures of the 
communist regime. 
<H5>  Russian Example </H5>
  An editorial in the 9 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY warned that the 
recent experience of Russia demonstrated the dangers inherent in 
unimpeded growth of organized crime: "We should see what the 
Mafia has done in Russia, where, in only the past few years, it 
has become one of the forces controlling the country. Now they 
are looking toward us as partners. In this context, we should 
look at the development of organized crime in our country." 
<H5>  Drug Smuggling </H5>
  Polish criminals have made their country the fourth-largest 
European producer of illegal amphetamines, behind the 
Netherlands, Great Britain, and Belgium, according to an article 
in the 9 May ZYCIE WARSZAWY. Polish amphetamines are reportedly 
destined primarily for the German and Scandinavian markets. The 
paper noted that Polish drug dealers had been arrested recently 
in Berlin for attempting to sell 10 kilograms of Polish-produced 
amphetamines, worth approximately 144,0O0 German marks. 
  The 27 April ZYCIE WARSZAWY reported that the largest single 
seizure of illegal drugs in the history of Britain was made on 
board a Polish freighter in the harbor of Liverpool. The ship, 
which was en route from Venezuela to Poland, contained 520 
kilograms of "very-high-quality" cocaine, hidden in glue cans. 
The cocaine was said to have been intended for distribution to 
West European markets via Poland.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Federal Prime Minister Zeljko Simic </F>
by Radio Valjevo correspondent Mirko Stojkanovic in Valjevo on 
13 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Begin recording] [Stojkanovic] Deputy Federal Prime 
Minister Zeljko Simic said this evening at the [Socialist Party 
of Serbia] gathering in Valjevo that this is a crucial time for 
resolving the (?economic) crisis and particularly the war in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
[FRY] can no longer view the world -- unfair though it is -- 
through the sights on a gun; it is time for it to intelligently 
and wisely realize its strategic interests -- sovereignty, 
territorial integrity, and citizens' liberties. Neither the 
people nor the FRY political leadership will accept any 
supporters of the war option. This was a chance to ask the 
deputy federal prime minister just how close we are to peace, 
what the agreement on the cessation of hostilities recently 
signed in Geneva means, and what are the things that on one hand 
bring us closer to, and on the other hand take us farther away 
from the so desired peace? 
  [Simic] I would like to be extremely direct toward your 
listeners and would say that we have taken a step forward, 
because the coming month is going to test the behavior of all 
three sides involved in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
with the clear hope that the Yugoslav leadership is investing in 
the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs with the hope that it will 
consistently adhere to the obligations taken in Geneva, and thus 
show the international public that all of Serbhood [svekoliko 
Srpstvo] favors peace rather than war, while the Muslim side -- 
which in the meantime has received immense support, both 
military and political -- is the side -- and I am now going to 
quote Mr. Alija Izetbegovic -- that will never agree to peace, 
but will pursue the realization of its centuries-long dream of 
creating a fundamentalist state on the territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina [sentence as heard]. Therefore, I believe 
that this is a very important moment -- both tactically and 
strategically speaking -- for the FRY and for all of Serbhood, 
since the one-month cease-fire -- under the patronage of UN 
secretary general's special envoy Yasushi Akashi -- is extremely 
favorable because it allows the political positions and options 
of all three sides involved in the war to crystallize, and on 
the other hand enables the international public opinion to form 
a balanced attitude toward Yugoslavia, and allows the full 
expression of the truth about the foreign policy orientation and 
the Yugoslav leadership's authentic option. 
  [Stojkanovic] The press is reporting that the armed 
conflicts have been subsiding since the day the cease-fire went 
into effect, but Alija Izetbegovic has told the Bosnian radio 
that the Muslims -- if the West does not help them to resolve 
the situation to their advantage -- will use a secret weapon. 
He then mentioned the alliance with the Muslim countries 
against the West. Does this take us farther away from peace? 
  [Simic] No. On the contrary, I believe that in a certain 
sense this exposes -- the term is perhaps harsh but it is 
fitting -- Mr. Alija Izetbegovic's position which the West has 
been covering up for a long time. Therefore, it has been 
covered up from the very beginning of the civil war, or more 
precisely, since the Lisbon Conference which was held before the 
civil war broke out, and when the Muslim side was offered a 
settlement which was far more favorable than any of the ones 
that followed. Of course, I am not gloating over this 
statement, but I assess it as being politically very significant 
because it exposes the intentions of the Muslim leadership under 
Alija Izetbegovic, who, using the language of ultimatum, 
continues to threaten. Moreover, he is now threatening his 
recent or current allies, in a way that cannot be well received 
by the international public. 
  [Stojkanovic] Mr. Simic, how would you assess the situation 
that developed around FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement in 
Novi Sad, that millions of FRY citizens cannot be hostages of 
any political leader, either in the FRY, the Srpska republic, or 
the republic of Serbian Krajina. This statement was later 
followed by several statements, so we could even say that this 
statement was to the disadvantage of the Srpska republic 
negotiating team in Geneva. Is there danger of a conflict 
developing between the two leaderships -- the Srpska republic 
one and the FRY? 
  [Simic] FRY President Zoran Lilic's statement was an 
extremely precise, direct, and I believe, politically extremely 
wise. There was no way it could damage the Bosnian Serbs' 
negotiating position in Geneva. In fact, it could only 
strengthen it, insofar as the problem of the civil war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has been artificially connected with 
Yugoslavia's position. It has been artificially connected with 
it insofar as the sanctions were imposed on Yugoslavia without 
any valid reasons. However, if this is the political reality, 
then we must say that the interests of the people -- therefore, 
the interests of all of Serbhood -- are above any willful 
actions of any politician. There can be no comment on this. The 
fact that the FRY president included himself among the potential 
people who could -- through their actions -- disturb the 
strategic goals of both this country and all of Serbhood, speaks 
for the fact that there was no way that he could have been 
attempting to fan or inspire any type of conflict. The 
statement was given principally, with the aim of sobering both 
the public and certain significant political individuals, 
warning them that they could not place their personal interests, 
or even their will, above the interests of primarily one state 
that has its foundations, that is strong, that will be reborn 
after the economic revival, that is on the way to being 
reintegrated into the international community; therefore, no one 
can play with this. [end recording]

Seselj, chairman of the Serbian Radical Party, said at a news 
conference yesterday. 
  Seselj claims that Milosevic had constructed a plan 
(supported by the West) for a four-month truce in Bosnia, so 
that he could organize elections during that time and, with the 
help of the State Security Service, secure Karadzic's defeat at 
them. However, when it became clear to him that Karadzic cannot 
be defeated at elections "even with tricks," Milosevic decided 
in favor of a one-month truce and uninstitutional methods in 
order to replace Karadzic, Seselj said. 
  The Radicals have nevertheless said that they support any 
kind of truce, even a one-month one, although, according to 
them, one should insist on a permanent cease-fire and a 
separation at the achieved front lines. 
  Seselj sees the recent statement by [FRY President] Zoran 
Lilic at the recent Trade Union meeting in Belgrade as proof 
that a showdown between Milosevic and Karadzic is in the offing. 
"With that statement, Lilic has weakened the Serbs' negotiating 
positions in Geneva, so now he should be careful lest he 
experience [Dobrica] Cosic's fate, as he has also been violating 
the Constitution," Seselj said and added that "there is 
absolutely no doubt that Lilic is in fact Milosevic's 
mouthpiece." 
  Yesterday, the Radicals also distributed to journalists 
photocopies of ("top secret") orders on handing over weapons 
belonging to the Yugoslav People's Army's to the former Bosnian 
Territorial Defense. According to these documents (and Seselj 
claims that he has many more such papers), in September of 1991, 
Generals Nikola Uzelac and Zivan Mircetic approved of several 
hundred pieces of infantry weapons and the appropriate quantity 
of ammunition being given over to territorial defense commands 
in Bosanska Krupa, Cazin, and Velika Kladusa. Seselj claims 
that these documents prove a direct involvement of the League of 
Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia in arming the Muslims just 
before the war broke out.

<F P=106> [Article by Gordana Igric: "Belgrade: Newcomers and </F>
Old-Timers: Sam Plays It Again"] 
  [Text] Belgrade at night is reminiscent of Casablanca 
in the 1940's. Rich refugees and local "businessmen" drown their 
shady profiteer dealings in whiskey. 
  The watchman at a parking lot in downtown Belgrade, a 
refugee 
from Gorazde, loudly interprets the Serb right to the city that 
was once 70 percent Muslim, complains that he was not permitted 
to sing Serb songs there (Tito forbade it) and that he 
sacrificed great wealth for that. Now he is annoyed at the 
people of Serbia, who are only looking out for their own. He 
says that he lived only for a Greater Serbia, but now people 
look at his wife and children askance when they pick up their 
refugee packet. The people of Serbia do not know what true 
Serbhood is. 
  At that, a master electrician rushes out of the lobby. 
  "You are still crying for Tito. How is it that I sang Serb 
songs and because of that slaved to make an honest living? And 
you could have but did not want to. And I assume that you earned 
your wealth honestly, with your own two hands? There are bombs 
falling on your city while you pontificate to me. What kind of 
people are these?" the man from Sumadija says, throwing up his 
hands. "They prefer Greater Serbia and Belgrade to their own 
Bosnia and their own neighbors." 
  The tense atmosphere on the street, on a day when bombs were 
falling on Gorazde, is simply a reflection of the cold war being 
waged by newcomers and old-timers, two afflicted and divided 
worlds. People from the war zones have brought to ethnically 
indifferent Belgrade the dream of a Greater Serbia and of ethnic 
purity, while to the people of Belgrade their Serbhood seems a 
bit clumsy and silly. The fabric of wartime Belgrade is being 
eaten away by different dialects, customs, economic 
expectations, patriotism, and cash-based patriotism. 
<H5>  In the Hands of New "Owners" </H5>
  The old Belgrade is no more. The new, xenophobic one throws 
a 
Molotov cocktail at the Committee for Refugees, beats up street 
cleaners who do not have Serb surnames. Instead of bohemians, 
there are "skinheads," newly formed bullies, cruising around the 
city. In the morning, this sort of warning appears on the door 
of a building: "Do not tempt your fate. They can beat you up 
because they find you at home, they can rape your wife, mistreat 
your children--if you do not lock your front door." 
  Belgrade at night is irresistibly reminiscent of Casablanca, 
a big waiting room where very rich refugees and local 
"businessmen" drown their shady profiteer dealings in whiskey. 
The new owners of the city, arriving from the battlefield, have 
little in common with Bogart. Belgradians who managed to survive 
the communist invasion in 1945 and the decades of influx from 
rural areas bristle at this "new class" that is feeding the 
animosity toward all newcomers. 
  Luxury cars (with registration from the war zone), Rolex 
watches, mistresses in white fox coats--these are status symbols 
of the "foreign element" in the heart of Belgrade. Special 
shops, chains of coffee shops, bought-out boutiques, money spent 
mercilessly--this is the smell of the new Belgrade. 
  At the nighttime bar "Princ," four "businessmen" run up a 
bill of 800 German marks [DM] in one night. A tip of only DM200 
for the waiter. The "Hyatt" or "Plavi Jahac" are cult locations. 
Nightclubs are split into those where drinking is "fear-based" 
and where patrons buy on informal "credit" payable every month. 
At "Promocija," a waiter who tries to collect a bill gets a 
pistol held to his head, and the bill is not paid. The outline 
of a pistol inside a jacket serves as a sign to the waiter at 
"Princ" that he should not approach that table. Young policemen 
drink free of charge, which is how the owners pay for their 
protection. Everyday patrons drink on credit and pay at the end 
of the month. 
  The war has given the city a Colombian air. According to 
lawyer Rajko Danilovic, an old Belgradian, it all began back 
before the war, when hand-picked criminals were doing the 
political police's dirty liquidator work abroad. When the war 
began, they offered their services to the regime and pillaged 
the battlefields under the guise of patriotism. Now they are 
seriously counting on recognition and a "reward for service." 
  "Some of them continue to lay waste to the war zone, while 
others are involved in the trade in arms or fuel, together with 
the `white collars' and wealthy refugees. With the state's 
consent, a new establishment is being born with foreign exchange 
and contacts with commercial banks. The dominant role in this 
symbiosis is played by newcomers who are `coping'; without them, 
there is no `business' in Bosnia. Thus, they are a sort of 
lobby, dazzling their fellow citizens with symbols of success. 
Belgradians are not easily impressed." 
<H5>  Citizens and City-Haters </H5>
  "Plavi Jahac" brings together "young Bosnia." The same 
guests 
come every day, each spending DM100 daily. The people here are 
Karadzic's children, snipers from Sarajevo, smugglers of alcohol 
and cigarettes, but also cosmopolitan Bosnian youth. 
  Natasa Markovic, a journalist and the owner of "Plavi 
Jahac," 
longs for the old Belgrade and refuses to believe that the 
"occupation" will last. 
  ``Belgradians have closed themselves off in their apartments 
and in privacy, while nationalistic madmen and city-haters roam 
the heart of the city. This is most of all a war of 
civilization. I am frightened of the city-haters. I was sitting 
in `Plavi Jahac' with one of the well-known TV editors from Pale 
when I was `promised' that in a few years Sarajevo would be an 
`ecological city'--a cornfield. Now I know for sure--that is the 
dream of the city-haters. I know that they would do the same 
thing to Belgrade if they could. I am torn when I look at the 
young people in the bar, with their roots severed, but I also 
get mad when they say that they have `given everything for the 
Serb cause' and that they are our `liberators.' 
  Zora Cavic-Ilic, a translator and member of a diplomatic 
family from precommunist Belgrade, comments with agitation: 
  ``No one is happy. Only those who are naive, like children. 
Those who caused this war should have foreseen the animosity. 
We, the old Belgradians, live closed off, attentively following 
what is happening from a distance. That is also how we reacted 
to the Germans and to the Partisan `liberators.' We maintained 
our integrity. We have learned to survive and, like dolphins, to 
pass our experience on to our children through our genes. But 
the squalor enters every pore. It is in the air, our language is 
contaminated by it, there is horrible cursing, and people talk 
as if they are shouting from two hills. TV offers mediocrity and 
vulgarity as the universally applicable style, impudently 
imposing ignorance and vulgarity. And things could get worse. 
  "But," he warns, "a certain obstinacy has been awakened in 
me, an obstinacy to preserve myself like a rare animal. I will 
not accept a city of dirty cars, dirty shoes, and greasy hair." 
  Walking on the same street with the old Belgradians is Rosa 
E., a 50-year-old refugee from Sarajevo. A prominent high school 
teacher, she lives in an attic with her son, cleans other 
people's apartments, and when people scowl at her on the bus 
because of her different dialect she closes her eyes and the 
past returns: world travel, a weekend place on Korcula, two 
luxurious apartments in Sarajevo, crystal, and furs. Everything 
has been lost for good. She says that she will nevertheless 
return to Grbavica, to a vacated Muslim apartment. Here she has 
no roots. 
  An 80-year-old woman from Sarajevo, a former editor of 
PROSVETA who barely survived the first wartime winter in Bosnia, 
understands and loves Belgrade, and talks about Karadzic and 
Mladic as war criminals, as the biggest enemies of the Serb 
nation. 
  At the other refugee extreme, a 20-year-old disabled veteran 
from Brcko, with one leg missing, is embittered toward the 
opposition, Vuk Draskovic, and the peace movement. And also 
toward the Serbians, the degenerates of the Serb tribe. 
Enthusiastically he says: "After the war in Bosnia is over, we 
will come here; someone must teach you what Serbhood and 
Orthodoxy are." 
  "I had thought that the invasion of Belgrade was over, but 
we 
are experiencing it all anew," summarizes Rajko Danilovic. "The 
ones in 1945 acted like victors, with a right to city life, our 
property, and pretty Belgrade women. The new ones do not 
resemble the old ones, because they are experiencing defeat 
instead of victory. They bear the stamp of guilt." 
  What will tomorrow bring? 
  According to one poll conducted in Belgrade, 70 percent of 
those questioned feel that the coming year will be better, 
because it cannot be any worse. 
  Predrag Simic, director of the Institute for International 
Policy and Economics, said this to THE NEW YORK TIMES: "Serbs in 
Serbia no longer regard Bosnian Serbs as victims. How can you 
sympathize with people like General Mladic and others? They are 
people who should be pitied. We increasingly regard them as 
people who are dragging us into misfortune. Antiwar sentiment 
has gained a great deal of strength here." 
  However, pessimists expect only more misfortune once the war 
is over and accounts are settled. In their opinion, some 
disoriented people will return, but also arriving in the 
"waiting room" will be new people from impoverished Knin or 
"liberated" Zvornik. It is believed that Belgrade will never rid 
itself of criminals and profiteers. In the future, they will 
become influential and respected citizens of Belgrade, 
industrialists or politicians with clear positions in the 
establishment. They will decide the fate of the meek citizens 
who do not have pagers and revolvers.

<F P=106> [Article by Perica Vucinic: "On the Scene: Kosovo Canards"] </F>
  [Text] The Albanian businessman pays taxes to two 
states, in general he is a merchant or manufacturer and has more 
money, while the Serb businessman is most often an intermediary 
between the Albanians and the state, for which he takes a 
commission. 
  After the blanket assessments to the effect that the crisis 
of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia began in Kosovo 
with the conflict between Kosovo Albanians and the Yugoslav 
authorities and that it will also end there, the political 
prognosis according to which "Kosovo's turn is coming up" is 
becoming increasingly widespread. This latter notion is 
convincing, if for no other reason because of the passage of 
time and the weight and ripeness of the problem. The fact that 
the time to solve the problem of the southern Serbian province 
is coming up is indicated by the visit to Belgrade and Pristina 
arranged by Douglas Hogg, British secretary of state for foreign 
affairs, on 5 and 6 May. The British diplomat departed. 
Speculation by commentators, based primarily on his comment that 
Albanians must be given broad autonomy within the framework of 
Serbia, has already run full course. Hogg's visit also served as 
an agent for circulating "information" about how negotiating 
teams of the Serbian authorities and of the Kosovo Albanians 
have already been formed. This "information" is refuted by the 
very "composition" of the negotiating teams, which contain, for 
example, the deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia, Zeljko Simic, and the chairman of the Democratic 
Party of Serbia (DSS), Vojislav Kostunica, who cannot reconcile 
himself with the authorities. 
  Reports on the negotiators presented by Radio Cologne and 
the 
Pristina Albanian-language weekly KOHA, which were also carried 
by Belgrade media, are classic "canards" from a journalistic 
viewpoint. Their motivation, however, is purely political in 
nature and contains the message that it is time to move beyond 
the deadlock once and for all. 
  This is because after Hogg's visit, which provoked a bit of 
political agitation, Kosovo is returning to its prior state, 
which means that the unrecognized, self-proclaimed republic of 
Kosovo--recognized only by Albania--and the Republic of Serbia 
are functioning in parallel in the same territory. Moreover, 
both of them are trying to assert their rights and avoid 
obligations if they can. The Serbian state has imposed its 
police structure and left it up to the Albanians to organize 
autonomous education, culture and sports, social and 
administrative institutions, and even autonomous tax 
authorities, but without neglecting to collect the taxes owed to 
it. The Albanians, although they ignore Serbian administration 
wherever they can, do not refuse rights to health care and 
hospital treatment. In the area of national defense, it appears 
that a tacit agreement has been reached--the Albanians do not 
join the armed forces of the country that they do not regard as 
their own, while the Armed Forces of Yugoslavia (VJ) does not 
need disloyal guardians of territory. That is how two national 
communities live in parallel in Kosovo. Now and then, they meet 
only in the area of business interests. And thanks to those 
interests, at the "Businessmen's Club" in Pristina one can learn 
from the conversation of a pair of new businessmen, newly rich 
Serbs and Albanians, that they are fascinated with the flights 
of "various airplanes and DC 9's and DC 10's" and that in such 
airplanes "you do not even feel that you are being transported 
and you can comfortably have drinks on them." They were on the 
trail of material interest, and in so doing the Albanian is not 
bothered by the fact that the "Businessmen's Club" is a Serb 
bar, just as Serbs are not bothered by doing business in 
Albanian bars. They differ in that the Albanian pays taxes to 
two legal states, both the "Republic of Kosovo" and the Republic 
of Serbia. But the Albanian has more money and is generally a 
merchant or manufacturer, while the Serb, thanks to the absolute 
domination of Serbs in the bureaucratic structure, is most often 
an intermediary with the state, and if he holds a position, then 
he is an intermediary with himself and takes a commission, or a 
bribe. 
<H5>  Adjustment in Process </H5>
  In other fields, Kosovo's Serb and Albanian worlds seem 
irreconcilable. In the Albanian pastry shop "Elida" and the Serb 
cafe "Donatelo," establishments in the "Boro i Ramiz" sports 
hall separated only by a corridor, these worlds, relaxing in 
almost the same atmosphere, regard each other with indifference. 
But that is a story that has already been told. 
  The two worlds of Kosovo live their lives in the political 
cocoons of "the independent Republic of Kosovo" and "unified 
Serbia." Postponing the political conflict, albeit only conflict 
in the form of dialogue, gives rise to illusions, but also to 
tension. 
  "This is the status quo, a balance of fear, a state of 
neither war nor peace, and it will continue as long as it suits 
both sides," says Skeljzen Malici, ex-politician and founder and 
former chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Malici, who is 
now a journalist, repeats the theory that the Kosovo war is 
being waged in Bosnia, that the Serbs in Bosnia, "in fighting 
for their own ethnic rights, are also fighting for the ethnic 
rights of Albanians. Because if they had enough territorial 
jurisdiction in Bosnia, perhaps Serbian President Slobodan 
Milosevic would agree to a formula of broad 
autonomy--territorial, political, cultural--and that in practice 
would lead to independence for Kosovo." The common platform of 
all significant parties who captured seats in the parliament of 
the "Republic of Kosovo," which has yet to constituted, is an 
independent Kosovo, but it appears that a consensus has also 
been reached on the view that such a thing is unrealistic for 
now. Such a position can also be heard in the leading party of 
Kosovo Albanians, the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo (DSK), which 
received 76 percent of the votes in the Albanian-only elections 
on 24 May 1991. 
  However, mention of the broad autonomy guaranteed to 
Albanians under the 1974 SFRY Constitution is true heresy, and 
immediately after the visit by the British Foreign Office 
official with the leader of the Kosovo Albanians, Ibrahim 
Rugova, the DSK Information Center tried to relativize the clear 
suggestion by the high-ranking guest that the solution for 
Kosovo should be sought in autonomy on a wide scale and within 
the framework of Serbia. Dr. Fehmi Agani, the vice chairman of 
the DSK and Ibrahim Rugova's right-hand man, said in an 
interview with VREME that the British diplomat is still in the 
process of adjusting his views. However, there are still no 
results of that adjustment. Another Albanian ex-politician, 
Veton Suroi, the founder and former chairman of the 
Parliamentary Party and now publisher of the weekly KOHA, 
rejects the solution in the 1974 Constitution, but for entirely 
different reasons. "We have gone beyond 1974 and must be more 
creative than Kardelj," Suroi says succinctly. 
  The definition of Kosovo under the Constitution of 20 years 
ago as a point of conflict, but also of encounter, between Serb 
and Albanian interests is an unpleasant framework for talks for 
the Serb side as well. The chairman of the provincial committee 
of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Vojislav Zivkovic, 
elaborates on the part according to which the province is 
defined as an integral part of Serbia. "Kosovo is not an open 
question; rather, the problem is how to persuade the Albanians 
to sit down and talk. When Europe says, as Great Britain has 
done, that Kosovo is an integral part of Serbia, I am convinced 
that the majority of Albanians will ultimately accept that," 
says Zivkovic. 
  The problem with Serb politicians--as indeed with Albanian 
ones if they are in positions of power--is that their 
authorities are very minimal, so that the political discourse is 
reduced to the well-known approach of justifying the national 
strategies contained in political slogans. With the prefix "ex" 
they are authentic, but they exert no great amount of political 
influence. 
  Momcilo Trajkovic, the former deputy prime minister of 
Kosovo 
and then the SPS deputy heading the departmental group on 
solving Kosovo's problems, and then a renegade from the party 
and founder of the Social Democratic Party, will say, not 
without cynicism, that he "cannot believe that Serbian President 
Milosevic declared that `there is no problem' with giving 
autonomy to the Albanians." "Milosevic has no right to say such 
a thing, and I really doubt that he could have said that 
publicly. That would have meant the beginning of the end of his 
authority, which is in fact based on Kosmet [Kosovo and 
Metohija]," says Trajkovic. He believes that the Albanians' 
contribution to solving the Kosovo problem is to publicly 
renounce pretensions to a Kosovo republic, while the Serbs 
should recognize that Albanians "are here in real numbers, in 
order to create the trust necessary to live together and permit 
talks on the organization of that life." 
<H5>  Serb Differences </H5>
  In the last election campaign, Trajkovic ran under the 
slogan 
"Vote for the ones who have linked their destiny to Kosovo and 
Metohija" and lost. The former SPS figure and subsequent social 
democrat has now linked his destiny to the "Ratar" collective 
farm in Laplje Selo, where he is director, and it could be said 
that this latest role suits him. With pride he emphasizes that 
all 1,100 hectares of the farm have been planted, saying: "That 
is how to fight for Serb land in Kosovo." 
  Reflecting on the times to come, Trajkovic says that Serbia 
has done nothing in this interregnum to keep the Serbs from 
being outvoted again. He regards the civic state as a solution; 
however, in order to achieve that, the national state model must 
be given "free rein." He concludes that this is a process. 
  The political biography of the current director of the 
"Ratar" collective is somewhat characteristic of the present-day 
Serb divisions in Kosovo. Trajkovic, who began his political 
career in the 1980's by standing up against the "autonomist 
policy" of the (Serb) Kosovo government, is accused of being an 
autonomist. He responds in kind, reminding the current holders 
of power where they were and whom they supported 10 years ago. 
Thus, the Serb political scene in the province is divided into 
two types of autonomists, which leads us to the current Serb 
division into "newcomers" and "old-timers," whereby the 
"Trajkovic school of politics" corresponds to the old-timers. 
According to this terminology, the current okrug government is 
in the hands of the newcomers. 
  Although it is impossible to strictly categorize the types 
of 
political thought, it is indeed possible to establish a 
fundamental difference. The group designated "old-timers" 
supports a practical policy that would integrate Albanians into 
the structures of provincial government. "They must be given 
something, because they make up 90 percent of the population 
here. They will participate in government sooner or later, and 
for that reason there must be a mechanism to keep the Serbs from 
being outvoted," is the private reflection of one Kosovo 
politician, a member of the ruling Serb party. His name remains 
"underground," as does the reflection through which he risks 
being labeled an "autonomist," i.e., "old-timer." 
  In the Albanian political bloc there is discord not 
concerning goals, but rather concerning strategy. No one 
questions Dr. Ibrahim Rugova's authority, and the strength and 
influence of his DSK are not questioned either, but there is 
criticism of his monopoly on power, the attitude of some 
important Albanian intellectuals outside the party, and the 
politically passive approach. The most vocal critics are 
academician Redzep Cosja, an ideologist of the Albanian national 
question, and Adem Demaci, chairman of the Forum for Human 
Rights, political dissident and longtime political prisoner, and 
publisher of the journal FORUM. Demaci is known as a person 
ready to make political concessions, but also as a harsh critic 
of the DSK and its structures for their lack of resolve in 
defending the achieved Albanian institutions that the 
authorities have abolished: the Albanological Institute, the 
Kosovo Academy of Science and Art, and Albanian-language 
newspapers and journals. During Douglas Hogg's visit, Adem 
Demaci was in Italy, from where he sent word via Television 
Tirana that Kosovo is relying too much on the foreign element 
and that it is the duty of "those concerned with politics to 
seek out and search for various ways to solve the problem. It is 
not enough to say that our option is this and that, and thus to 
stand and watch.... I think we have had more than enough of 
Albanians talking among themselves. It is very necessary that 
Albanians in fact speak with Serbia, because like it or not, 
Serbia is a factor with which we must reckon, with which we must 
come to terms," Demaci said. 
<H5>  "Honorable Solution" </H5>
  At the DSK congress that will almost certainly be held in 
late May or early June after several months of postponement, no 
spectacular changes in the party--and thus in Albanian policy as 
well--are expected. Almost no attention was given to the report 
from Tirana that Dr. Ibrahim Rugova and his host, Albanian 
President Sali Berisha, expressed their support for mediation of 
the Serbo-Albanian dispute by a third party. That report casts 
something of a shadow of legitimacy over the maximalist goal of 
a Kosovo republic. It also holds out the promise that the 
Albanian side has something to offer other than political 
maximalism, which "is not realistically feasible at this 
moment." In the trench warfare--fortunately, only of political 
options--between an independent Kosovo and a Serbia "that will 
be unified or will not exist at all," it seems that the real 
moment is raising an almost purely terminological problem: In 
what sort of lexical foil should concessions be wrapped while 
still emerging as virtuous before voters who have been promised 
the much-repeated slogans in this article. 
  The chairman of the Kosovo Helsinki Committee for Human 
Rights, Dr. Gazmend Pulja, proposes a federal republic of Kosovo 
within Yugoslavia as an "honorable solution" that would not 
threaten the territorial integrity of the FRY and that would 
allow the Serbs to preserve their political and practical 
interests. "It is not natural to aspire to a lower level of 
constitutional structure. Kosovo was a constituent unit of the 
federation, and the international community cannot accept a 
curtailment of the rights of 2 million Albanians when 500,000 
Montenegrins have a republic," Pulja explains. 
  Naturally, the shadow of possible war always hangs over 
Kosovo, but nevertheless it is increasingly pallid. Partially 
because many, such as Skeljzen Malici, feel that the war option 
was used up in Croatia and then in Bosnia, partially because the 
prevalent opinion is that Serbia is not capable of waging war on 
several fronts, that its wartime ambitions have been exhausted, 
especially under strong surveillance by the international 
community, and, among other things, because no one is ready to 
risk a war that would inevitably spread to the entire Balkan 
peninsula. In this sense, the possibility of partitioning Kosovo 
is considered completely superficially to be, by necessity, a 
war option. Malici thinks that in that case there would clearly 
be war as an alibi for demarcation. "The Serbs and Albanians 
could not do that on their own, without international 
mediation." Skeljzen Malici illustrates the unconvincing nature 
of the war option by pointing to the military weakness of 
Albania, as well as the unwillingness of the United States of 
America to support its militarily weak ally. 
  Besides the parallel system and parallel life, all in the 
same territory, the Serbs and Albanians are also demonstrating a 
common infirmity and inability to sit down at the negotiating 
table without international mediation. Naturally, this third 
party would also have to bear responsibility for the results of 
any concessions, because their political figures are not willing 
to do so. 
  Nevertheless, something is changing in Kosovo. Fields left 
uncultivated for decades are now greener than they have ever 
been. The "ordinary" Albanians and Serbs regard this land that 
they are working as their own, and there are no problems 
whatsoever here; such problems invariably arise when the 
question of who land in Kosovo belongs to is shifted to the 
level of politics. Problems also emerge when the state raises an 
issue like land redistribution, which is already very delicate, 
because in Kosovo each normal issue has specific Kosovo 
deviations.

<F P=106> [Report by K. Cangova: "The Census Within the Deadline"] </F>
  [Text] The preparations must be completed for the census 
in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] from 21 June to 5 July according to 
schedule. All the deadlines for this major statistical survey 
have been met and there is no reason to suspect that anything 
will go wrong. This was stated at yesterday's news conference 
organized by the State Census Commission to report on the 
progress of work on the census. Namely, it was emphasized that 
the appointment of the communal census commissions had been 
completed, that they had been constituted, and that they had 
started work. On these commissions 356 members have been 
elected, of which there are 34 (including three Albanians) 
presidents, 102 specialists, and 222 basically elected on a 
national basis, so the legal criteria have been respected. Of 
the 222 members on the communal census commissions 50.4 percent 
are Macedonians, 15.32 Albanians, 11.26 Turks, 9.46 Romanies, 
1.35 Vlachs, 5.41 Serbs, 2.7 Muslims, 1.32 Egyptians, and 2.7 
percent other nationalities. 
  We were informed by President of the State Census Commission 
Risto Ivanov that the criterion for appointing members to the 
communal census commissions from the nationalities has been 
respected. Disagreements about Article 24 of the Census Law 
related to these appointments did not arise in the State Census 
Commission, but in the communal assemblies, where the article 
was differently interpreted. Ivanov emphasized that it is 
legally clear that the national structure has to be respected 
only for the members that are appointed from the nationalities, 
while those members -- such as specialists in statistics, 
urbanism, geodesy, and demography -- do not have to belong to 
particular nationalities. The criterion on which the national 
structure was determined was based on the last census in 1991, 
and wherever there was over 1 percent of a certain nationality, 
at least one member of that nationality was appointed. According 
to these criteria, 110 people have been appointed to the 
communal census commissions, of whom 34 are Albanians, 24 Turks, 
21 Romanies, 3 Vlachs, 12 Serbs, 6 Muslims, 3 Egyptians, and 6 
other nationalities. 
  As for remarks on the structure of the personnel carrying 
out 
the census, this was not defined according to the structure of 
the population in a commune or a locality, but depended on 
whether in a census area a certain nationality participates with 
50, that is 20 percent of the whole population structure, which 
is the condition for selecting a person from that nationality. 
[sentence as published] In order to ensure people's right to 
use the language of their nationality, that is Albanian, 
Turkish, Vlach, Romany, or Serbian, those who know that language 
must be selected, regardless of their nationality. Selections 
are also made regardless of nationality in cases where there are 
no candidates of a particular nationality who meet the 
conditions. 
  President of the State Census Commission Risto Ivanov 
pointed 
out that in the first stage there were 10,000 applicants to be 
census officials and communal instructors, which was not 
sufficient, and in the second 11,000, which was sufficient for 
testing the candidates. If we do not obtain people with the 
necessary language abilities, there will probably be another 
round of testing. Yesterday, Ivanov denied that these "census 
takers" will not be paid, because, as he said, there was a book 
of payment regulations. He also denied that this was the reason 
that a large number of applicants had refused the testing. 
  Concerning the citizenship regulation, it was stated that 
this was a matter for the Interior Ministry. According to the 
State Census Commission's information, around 94 percent of the 
citizens in the state have been officially sent citizenship 
certificates, one of several identification papers acceptable in 
the census. The full situation will be known in the course of 
the day, and by 15 June all those meeting the conditions for 
citizenship will possess adequate documents. Until 5 June the 
Interior Ministry was officially sending information by mail, 
and since then citizens have been able to appeal to regional 
offices for such documents. 
  During the census there will be around 100 organizations 
present in the country, which will have the opportunity to 
monitor the development of the statistical survey, and it is up 
to the European Commission to decide which countries they will 
come from. As Svetlana Antonovska, director of the Republican 
Statistical Department, said, at the moment work is being done 
on applications from observers and representatives of 
international organizations and statistical departments from 
other countries, and so far there are representatives of the 
National Institute for Statistics of Bulgaria, the Council of 
Europe, and the CSCE, who have confirmed that they will be 
present.

<F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "Watergate for a Second Time"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, at a news conference, the President of 
VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity] 
Ljupco Georgievski distributed copies of a "document" to 
journalists, which "confirms that the State Security Service 
[SDB] is continuing its active telephone bugging of the main 
opposition party's offices." Allegedly, this has to do with the 
discussions held between [VMRO-DPMNE Deputy President] Dosta 
Dimovska and the SDB "collaborator" codenamed "Coordinator" (the 
allusion is apparently to Tomislav Stefkovski, until recently 
the coordinator of the party's parliamentary group before 
setting up a faction). 
  Georgievski claims that the "document" reveals that the SDB 
is dealing with the VMRO-DPMNE under the codename "Lion," while 
the whole operation is called "Division." Georgievski also 
claims that the SDB has formed a command center on several 
levels that "not only passively follows the work of the party, 
but is also actively involved in it, with the purpose of 
completing the operation [to split the party]." The VMRO-DPMNE 
is publicly calling on the public prosecutor of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
to react and it hopes that the affair will end in court. Until 
then, the party will not respond to the accusations and attacks 
of the factionists. 
  According to Georgievski, the whole affair has been created 
with the aim of distracting the attention of the public from the 
real problems -- the Serbian threats to the security of 
Macedonia and the incidents on the border. Moreover, 
Georgievski indicated that they are in possession of a document 
similar to this, but like the one codenamed "Cave," in which the 
publicly known "Curve" is mentioned, there is another subject 
entitled "Cocktails" (related to the so- called "bombing 
campaign" in Veles), as well as some others. The VMRO-DPMNE 
claims that it has also been informed about the SDB's criminal 
activities against some private businessmen. When we asked him 
if he was ready to produce the "evidence" of the claims that the 
present deputy secretary of the SDB, Slobodan Bogoevski, handed 
over to him confidential information on Boris Zmejkovski, 
Georgiveski replied that he had a couple of witnesses who could 
testify to this, and that if Mr. Bogoevski sued the leader over 
his statement, these witnesses would testify in court. 
  Asked about the authenticity of the "document" presented to 
the public, Georgievski demanded that an expert study be done on 
the typewriter on which this document was written (in the Latin 
alphabet). As far as the [7 June] meeting with President 
Gligorov is concerned, Georgievski said that the head of the 
state had neither confirmed nor denied his statements, so the 
party leadership is satisfied with the discussions. The 
presentation of this document, as Georgievski put it, is a 
message to the SDB that the VMRO-DPMNE "knows a lot." 
Georgievski underlined that his party is receiving such 
documents from SDB people who were perfect strangers until only 
yesterday, because they are displeased with what their service 
is doing. Finally, Georgievski called on the Macedonian public 
to put a stop to these SDB activities.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "VMRO-DPMNE Public Announcement"] </F>
  [Text] In its announcement for the public, VMRO-DPMNE 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party 
for Macedonian National Unity] most bitterly criticized latest 
staff purges in the Interior Ministry, which turn the ministry 
into a committee of protection of the current ruling coalition, 
especially SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of Macedonia] and 
the Liberal Party. Mr. Gogov's [former deputy head of the 
Interior Ministry Operative Department] press conference clearly 
showed police leaders Frckovski [minister of internal affairs], 
Bogoevski [undersecretary in the intelligence service], and 
Gjurev must leave immediately. Fabricating political processes 
against innocent people was a feature of totalitarian 
Stalinist-communist regimes, but Macedonia is obviously not 
immune to this. Democracy and human rights are continually 
being narrowed by the current true dictatorship, the 
announcement says. The party demands that the Interior Ministry 
officially explain the role of the recently killed high 
inspector Dimce Ristovski in revealing a crime including over a 
million German marks, with a presumable involvement of the 
minister of health, Jovan Tofovski. The party also appealed to 
Pavle Trajanov, in the name of democracy and the future of the 
Macedonian state, to publicly reveal government's attempts to 
discredit him in the eyes of the public, and state other 
fabricated cases, as well as the government involvement in 
organized crime in the country.

<F P=106> [Report by Z. Skerlev: "Macedonia Insists on a Package </F>
Solution"] 
  [Text] Yesterday, the special envoy of the U.S. President 
and mediator in the Macedonian-Greek dispute, Mr. Matthew 
Niemitz, held talks with the President of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Kiro Gligorov after holding discussions with Foreign Minister 
Stevo Crvenkovski in Ohrid. 
  On this occasion they exchanged opinions about the current 
stage of the Macedonian-Greek negotiations and the possibility 
of resuming the dialogue on disputed questions. This time, too, 
the Republic of Macedonia's stance was reiterated on the need 
for an urgent lifting of the unilateral embargo and for all the 
questions to be solved as a package. President Gligorov made a 
special review of the difficulties suffered by Macedonia because 
of the Greek embargo and the real danger that it represents for 
a greater destabilization of the republic and the whole region. 
He also expressed his belief that in the next round of 
negotiations with the mediators from New York there will be 
greater likelihood for solving this situation, which has already 
become a clear element of threat to the stability in the south. 
  During the discussions there was also an exchange of 
opinions 
about the further development of relations between the United 
States and the Republic of Macedonia. On what was referred to 
as "an exchange of opinions about the current views of Macedonia 
and Greece in relation to the solution of mutual problems," 
Minister Crvenkovski and Mr. Niemitz made short statements to 
journalists. 
  "Yesterday we had long and extensive discussions in smaller 
delegations, and today we had discussions with the president of 
the republic," Minister Crvenkovski said. "We discussed all the 
aspects of the situation here and particularly the damage caused 
to Macedonia by the embargo, as well as the whole situation in 
the region. We discussed a number of other questions of 
importance for the whole region and we hope that we shall soon 
have another opportunity to meet and continue these discussions, 
and that we shall also have continual meetings with Mr. Cyrus 
Vance." 
  In his statement to the journalists, among whom, as usual, 
there were a large number from the Greek media, Mr. Niemitz said 
that it was his great honor to be here again and to have two 
days of discussions about these issues. "As you know, we had 
serious discussions in New York. Cyrus Vance and I talked with 
Minister Crvenkovski there, but we thought it was a good idea to 
come and hold discussions here. There is no special reason for 
this, or any special message, just fruitful discussions." 
  After that Mr. Niemitz stated that he was ready to answer 
some journalists' questions. The first was whether he had 
nothing more to say after his few days of discussions in Greece 
and Macedonia. 
  "I will just say," Niemitz said, "that we have all agreed 
not 
to talk or discuss the contents of the meetings. I know that 
this is frustrating for you journalists, but it is a fact that 
it is a far better way for comprehending some of the subjects. 
There is nothing for publication, there are no breakthroughs or 
changes of policy or ideas, but I think, in my personal view, 
that there is a better understanding and viewing of the 
situation and the position of both sides, so, from my point of 
view, it was a good idea for me to come here and have this 
useful series of meetings." 
  Asked whether there existed opportunities for a direct 
dialogue between the two countries, Niemitz said that this was 
something to be discussed between the two countries, but that he 
had not discussed this. The task that was assigned to him by 
the President of his country was to talk with both sides in 
order to clarify the concepts, and thus to examine and explain 
the other positions. If the two countries wanted to talk with 
each another, that would be something that they would have to 
agree upon. 
  "There are some aspects of the relations between the two 
countries that were reconsidered with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus 
Vance, which is a normal and acceptable method, and I would like 
to say that the leaderships of the two countries are approaching 
the problems with seriousness. And that is how most of the 
problems can be solved." 
  The next question was whether there had been any progress in 
the discussions. Niemitz replied that he was not going to talk 
about what had been discussed and the word "progress" for this 
kind of discussion was irrelevant. "I talked with both sides," 
he said, "about their positions, and that is all I can say for 
now." 
  As we heard, Mr. Niemitz is leaving Macedonia today. Whether 
intentionally or unintentionally there have not been scheduled 
new consultations in Athens, so he is leaving for New York, 
where, as we know, Macedonian Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski 
and his Greek counterpart Karolos Papoulias will go next week 
for indirect discussions with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance, 
the special envoy of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.

<F P=106> [Replies by Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a </F>
Democratic Slovakia, to questions from PRAVDA correspondent 
Marian Lesko during the "Thirteen Plus One Debate" organized by 
the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK in Bratislava on 8 June: "I Envy You 
for Knowing What I Know"] 
  [Text] The guest of yesterday's "Thirteen Plus One" event, 
which was organized by the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK [FREE FRIDAY] 
by the Danube, was Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and deputy to the National Council 
of the Slovak Republic. During the debate, the PRAVDA 
correspondent asked him the following questions: 
  [Lesko] Mr. Deputy, there have not been many opportunities 
to meet you since March; therefore, I would like to return to 
some older affairs. In the television program "Kroky" [Steps] 
about two months ago, you said that the fundamental change of 
your stand on the Tatragate affair [involving the alleged "sale" 
of the right to commercial use of the Tatra mountains to a U.S. 
company] was linked to a certain document you had obtained only 
a few weeks before and that you did not have at your disposal 
earlier. I would like to ask you what kind of document this is 
and why it has not been published to date. And now my second 
question: At about this time last year, [Deputy Prime Minister] 
Mr. Roman Kovac said under the chestnut trees [in the garden of 
the Slovak Government building in Bratislava] that he had 
received some $5 million. How is it possible that you did not 
file a lawsuit against him at that time, and how is it possible 
that he kept executing the post of deputy prime minister for a 
few more months? 
  [Meciar] It is fairly easy to respond to the first question. 
We discussed in the government a report on a trip to the United 
States by [then Deputy Prime Minister] Mr. Kucerak, [then 
Finance Minister and present president] Mr. Kovac, Mr. Rakicky, 
and perhaps there was also a fourth member of the delegation. 
We approved that report and considered the matter closed. We 
did not know at that time that there existed yet another signed 
document. Subsequently, a commission of the National Council 
carried out an inquiry, but, as you know, the commission of 
inquiry was practically recalled before it reached any 
conclusions. The commission was chaired by a Green Party 
deputy, whose name was Huba. This commission never completed 
its work. After we went over to the opposition, one citizen 
came to see me and brought a copy of documents that he called 
the fourth part and that carried the signatures of Mr. Kucerak, 
Mr. Kovac, and Mr. Rakicky and showed that an agreement had been 
concluded in the United States. I then had a talk with Mr. 
Rakicky, in which he confirmed this act, when it happened, and 
under what circumstances. I was not the only person before whom 
Mr. Rakicky confirmed this. Even before that, he had confirmed 
it to another member of my government. I therefore believe that 
these matters have been proved and that parliament should take 
them and investigate them. 
  As far as Mr. Roman Kovac is concerned, the situation was 
somewhat more complicated. He really admitted this fact [the 
acceptance of a $5-million bribe]. Quite a few of us were 
present when he said it, and we remember it well. Should it be 
necessary to remind him, we will do so one more time. As for 
the conclusions, what options and possible solutions were open 
to me? The option of asking the president of the Republic to 
recall him was not feasible. At that time, the president had 
already considered Roman Kovac as my successor for the post of 
prime minister. The option of asking parliament to pass a vote 
of no confidence in him was equally unfeasible because some 
[HZDS] deputies from Zilina district had already announced that, 
should anything be done to remove Kovac, they would leave the 
[HZDS] club of deputies. The third option, that of filing 
criminal charges, was also unfeasible because Roman Kovac, in 
his capacity as deputy to the Federal Assembly, enjoyed immunity 
and there was no one to strip him of this immunity. There was 
an analogous case involving Duray; the Mandate and Immunity 
Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
declared that it did not have the authority to strip him of 
immunity. We therefore thought we would drop Roman Kovac from 
the government in the process of concluding a coalition 
agreement with the Slovak National Party. This resulted in a 
very strong internal misunderstanding, with Keltosova, 
Gasparovic, Roman Kovacj, and me present. Following talks with 
the president, it was impossible at that time to put forward a 
proposal that Roman Kovac be recalled. I more or less announced 
to Kovac that he could not be in the government and called upon 
him to resign from the government, which he did not do. At that 
time, he had simply already worked differently, and the 
alliances were different. You know well that, from 
approximately March 1993, there were efforts on the part of the 
Castle to recall my government, and, from approximately August, 
the president was proposing Roman Kovac for my post to HZDS and 
National Council functionaries. This was announced to me 
personally. That was simply the limit, and nothing could be 
done at that moment. That is why we did what we did. By making 
it possible for him in that television program to sue me, I 
actually gave him the chance to clear his name. This was also 
discussed in the National Council, which is easier for him than 
to prove now that I was not speaking the truth. [sentence as 
published] If what I said was not the truth. 
  [Lesko] Judging from what you said, everything you know 
about Tatragate has been actually known to you since 1991. You 
have had plenty of opportunities since then to present your new 
standpoint and did not have to wait until March 1994. As for 
the second case, if you really lost trust in Roman Kovac in the 
summer of 1993, why did the HZDS authorize him to conduct 
coalition talks with the Slovak National Party, which, as is 
well known, took place in September and October 1993? He must 
have enjoyed your trust; otherwise, he would have scarcely been 
authorized to conduct these talks on behalf of the HZDS.... 
  [Meciar] Regarding the first question, I envy you for 
knowing what I know. These documents were not known to me in 
1991. There were two agreements. The first, which was known to 
me, was acknowledged by the government. The second was not 
known to me. As for the talks with the Slovak National Party, 
it is true that they were conducted also by Roman Kovac. But 
they were conducted also by Ivan Gasparovic and me. The 
conclusions from the talks were made by me. Roman Kovac was 
responsible only for the final legal formulation, or, to be more 
accurate, it was done in his office because there was a meeting 
in mine. He was not the only person present at these talks, in 
which there were many other participants. You know that the 
talks with the Slovak National Party were very complicated and 
took place concurrently along several lines. Apart from talks 
with [then Slovak National Party Chairman Ludovit] Cernak, there 
were also talks with a number of other Slovak National Party 
functionaries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by Alena </F>
Melicharkova; place and date not given: "I Am Not at All Afraid 
of Elections"] 
  [Excerpt] The final deadline for parties and movements to 
decide whether they will run in the elections independently, in 
a coalition, or on the slate of a stronger party is drawing 
near. Representatives of the Democratic Union announced some 
time ago that they would run independently. This will be no easy 
test for them. We talked to Jozef Moravcik, chairman of the 
Democratic Union and prime minister, about this difficulty and 
other issues. 
  [Melicharkova] After our interview several months ago, you 
said in a certain context that you were not afraid of anything. 
Are you not afraid of the coming elections and their results? 
When you look at the results of the current public opinion 
polls.... 
  [Moravcik] I am not at all afraid of the elections. To run 
in 
the elections, you need determination, above all. We have enough 
determination and the needed amount of self-confidence to run in 
the elections. We are trying to draft a very serious program 
that will be convincing--that is, we are creating the conditions 
for obtaining positive results in the elections. What is 
important is that we perform our duties well in order to 
convince the people that this style of government and politics, 
above all, are viable and capable of solving long-term problems 
of development in Slovakia. The current public opinion polls 
confirm that the coalition that has formed the government could 
continue. We will try to improve its position. 
  [Melicharkova] Do you anticipate that this or a similar 
government coalition could exist after the elections? 
  [Moravcik] This is one of the alternatives, and, in my 
opinion, it is quite likely. 
  [Melicharkova] You intend to present a summary of your 
government's activity to parliament before the elections. What 
do you consider to be the greatest success of your government 
Cabinet? 
  [Moravcik] We would like to develop in the economic field 
some activities that would stimulate development, which means 
outweighing a certain restriction that we have to impose in the 
state budget. This restriction is inevitable but should be 
counterbalanced by development stimuli. This is what we want to 
secure in the period before the elections. 
  [Melicharkova] The coalition government is a very 
interesting 
compromise, and its seems to be a good one for Slovakia. On the 
other hand, this coalition is very fragile. The most interesting 
solutions are reportedly reached during strong differences of 
opinion. Have you ever experienced a tough conflict or 
difference of opinion in your government? 
  [Moravcik] We cannot speak of conflicts. A difference of 
opinion is very natural and happens very often. It is quite a 
usual working method and a usual way of solving problems. From 
this point of view, everything is all right. Regarding the basic 
problem, I believe this coalition is less fragile than the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was. The HZDS was 
unable to retain its compactness. It was unable to keep its 
election results. I am convinced that this coalition is stronger 
and capable of exercising its power in the period for which it 
has received a mandate or in the period for which it could 
possibly receive a mandate after the elections. 
  [Melicharkova] It is often said that you have a calming 
effect on people. Was this not your main trait that you used to 
appeal to the people? Public opinion polls show that you are 
catching up with your predecessor. Or is there another reason 
for that? 
  [Moravcik] Personally, I have never analyzed this problem, 
so 
I will leave it up to the people. Maybe everything you said 
plays a part. I believe that the Slovak electorate is very 
rational and can very well express or reflect values that are 
important for Slovakia in this or that period. Maybe in this 
very period it is important to be able to calm the public and 
introduce a certain amount of discretion into decisionmaking. 
  [Melicharkova] One of our readers says that you are an 
artist 
when it comes to diplomatic answers. According to her, you can 
speak for a long time and say nothing. Why do politicians give 
diplomatic answers from time to time? 
  [Moravcik] I only speak exceptionally for a long time. I 
always try to say what is essential. 
  [Melicharkova] The Democratic Union wants to be a liberal 
party, but, in our part of the world, it has not been clearly 
explained yet what liberalism actually is. At a conference in 
the United States not so long ago, J. Carnogursky, chairman of 
the Christian Democratic Movement, defined liberalism as being 
very dangerous. What is liberalism, which the Democratic Union, 
of which you are the chairman, is going to push for? 
  [Moravcik] Liberalism is a basic orientation. We are 
interested in establishing a skeleton program for the 
development of Slovakia in which the basic ideas of liberalism 
would be used. Many publications and books have been written 
about the essence of liberalism. Liberalism emphasizes human 
values, human beings, and their responsibility. Liberal policy 
is also oriented that way. If we speak about economy, this 
policy is based on individual initiative, which means private 
ownership and emphasis on the responsibility of the individual 
not only in the sphere of economy but also in other spheres. For 
example, in the social sphere, liberalism prefers activities of 
the nongovernmental sector, various foundations, and similar 
organizations to the paternalism of the state, even if some 
paternalism cannot be avoided. Our intention is to create 
conditions for the people to be able to solve basic problems 
themselves, while the state should intervene where people are 
unable to solve these problems by their own activities or 
through institutions under civil law. This policy, in which the 
individual and his development have a central place, is based on 
support for education because education and cultural 
development, in fact, intensify the significance of the 
individual in society. Those are, in a certain sense, basic 
directions. 
  [Melicharkova] When you speak about the responsibility of 
the 
individual, what is the responsibility of the politician 
according to this philosophy? 
  [Moravcik] He secures the execution of the political power, 
state power, in a direction that makes it possible to develop 
society's mechanisms on these principles. This means that a 
liberal politician, above all, has to make it possible for the 
people to be able to secure the development of their own 
character and thus the development of society as a whole. 
  [Melicharkova] Governments are either successful or 
unsuccessful according to the extent to which they are able to 
secure economic development, which is closely linked to 
cooperation with economic experts. Whom do you consider to be 
the top expert in Slovakia? If we look at the Czech Republic, 
the country is swarming with economists. What is your opinion of 
Prime Minister Klaus's policy in that respect? 
  [Moravcik] Regarding your question on whom I consider to be 
the best economist...? I am a proponent of teamwork. I do not 
see any prominent person in Slovakia whom I could describe in 
that way. However, we have a lot of wise and competent experts, 
many of whom have a good chance of becoming good politicians. 
Regarding Mr. Klaus, I highly respect him as a politician. Above 
all, I appreciate his ability to make an unequivocal analysis 
that enables him to pinpoint and describe the essence of the 
matter very quickly and make a decision. Then there is the 
consistency in his policy. Despite the fact that I do not always 
agree with him politically, I have to respect the methods he is 
using. 
  [Melicharkova] My previous question was also linked to the 
question of who would be a better prime minister, an economist 
or a lawyer.... Do you see any advantages in the prime minister 
being a professional? 
  [Moravcik] This can have certain advantages. However, a 
politician should be universal--that is, the said criteria are 
only auxiliary. Of course, it depends on the function. You 
mentioned the function of prime minister: Here, universality is 
very important. The experience he acquires during his studies, 
as well as practical experience later on, is very important. 
However, professional orientation is only an auxiliary aspect.

<F P=106> [Article by "jl": "Relations With Slovakia Are a Priority"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--The new Hungarian Government will not 
be the government of 15 million Hungarians but the government of 
the 10.5 million citizens of Hungary, Imre Szekeres, executive 
deputy chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], 
declared at a meeting organized by the Sandor Marai Foundation 
in Bratislava yesterday. 
  Szekeres and Balint Magyar, head of the election campaign 
team of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, were speaking 
about the probable future Hungarian coalition government of 
Socialists and Liberals. They stressed that they ascribe 
priority significance to the settlement of relations with 
Slovakia. The coalition government will look after the fate of 
ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries, but in a style 
different from that of the present government--without 
interfering in the internal affairs of neighboring countries, 
pragmatically, so that these relations with the minorities 
become a factor of enhancement of trust. 
  Imre Szekeres was received yesterday by Prime Minister Jozef 
Moravcik. The Hungarian politician informed him that the new 
Hungarian prime minister, who will probably submit the new 
government's policy statement to parliament toward the end of 
this month, will wish to meet him within the shortest possible 
time. He also said that talks on the drafting of a basic treaty 
on relations between Slovakia and Hungary, which would contain 
guarantees of present borders and of the rights of ethnic 
minorities in both states, should start as soon as possible. 
  Szekeres also held talks with Peter Weiss, deputy chairman 
of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic and chairman of the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], with whom he discussed, 
among other issues, the possibilities of future cooperation 
between the SDL and the MSZP. The Hungarian politician also met 
with Jaroslav Volf, chairman of the Social Democratic Party in 
Slovakia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F>
Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "We 
Would Be Glad If We Could Support the Government"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pankovcinova] In explaining 
why he abstained during the vote on the signpost law, 
Coexistence Deputy M. Feher argued that, after the incorporation 
of proposals for changes, the government bill was undemocratic. 
Do you agree with him? Does it mean that the other Coexistence 
deputies, Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] 
deputies, and deputies of the government coalition parties voted 
for an undemocratic law? 
  [Duray] Unfortunately, Deputy Feher is right in that, had 
this draft been adopted, the law would have been discriminatory 
and restrictive. I can only express pleasure at the fact that 
it was not adopted. I agree with Interior Minister Pittner in 
that this problem must be addressed also in order to demonstrate 
to the European public that this petty issue will not be the 
stumbling block of democracy in Slovakia. 
  [Pankovcinova] All of the MKDH deputies voted for this law. 
The MKDH is your coalition partner, and, in the coalition 
agreement, you had agreed to vote unanimously in the National 
Council of the Slovak Republic on issues pertaining to 
minorities. In the case of the signpost law, this did not 
happen. Will this disrupt coalition relations between your two 
parties? 
  [Duray] We are going to hold consultations on this issue, 
and there could be a sharp exchange of opinions. However, this 
does not affect the substance of our cooperation. 
  [Pankovcinova] Why have you not yet signed a preelection 
coalition treaty with the MKDH, the signing of which you had 
heralded to reporters two weeks ago? 
  [Duray] The treaty is 90-percent ready. Only the final 
provisions remain to be drafted, the wording of which depends on 
whether there will be an agreement on a three-member coalition 
comprising also the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. Once we agree 
that a tight three-member coalition (which means conditions such 
as a joint club of deputies, joint course of action in communal 
elections, and joint representation of our voters' interests 
abroad) is acceptable to the MKDH, the treaty can be signed in a 
short time. 
  [Pankovcinova] According to the MKDH chairman, however, this 
is not acceptable. Will you sign a treaty on a two-member 
coalition, then? 
  [Duray] The treaty is ready, except for the final 
provisions. 
  [Pankovcinova] What is the Coexistence Movement's attitude 
toward the government coalition? Will you support the 
government until the last day of the last meeting of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic in this electoral term? 
  [Duray] We would be glad if we could. 
  [Pankovcinova] Under which conditions will you support it? 
  [Duray] At today's meeting of the Coalition Council, we will 
have talks not only on how to resolve the issue of the signpost 
law but also on the restructuring of the Ministry of Education. 
If we come to an agreement, we will support the government. 
  [Pankovcinova] And what if you do not come to an agreement 
on the signpost law and a possible deputies' draft of this law 
does not pass in the National Council of the Slovak Republic? 
  [Duray] We had agreed with the government even before it was 
formed under which conditions we would support it. I hope we 
will not have a reason not to support it. 
  [Pankovcinova] Let us assume that, at today's meeting of the 
Coalition Council, you will agree that the deputies' draft of 
the signpost law will be submitted in the form in which it was 
approved on 3 June, but without Deputy Kaliska's amendments 
[under which communities named after important figures of Slovak 
history should be exempted from the bilingual regime]. Will 
your deputies vote for such a law? 
  [Duray] We will propose that the version that was submitted 
to the National Council of the Slovak Republic by the government 
be used as the point of departure. Proposals for changes that 
expand the application of the signpost law are acceptable to us. 
We will support the proposal, under which it should be possible 
to designate Ukrainian and Ruthenian communities in these 
languages on a greater scale as well as the proposal that an 
exemption [from the provision, under which a minority must 
constitute at least 20 percent of the population for bilingual 
signposts to be installed in a community] be granted to 
communities inhabited by citizens of German nationality. We 
will support the signpost law in that form.

  [Text] Zvolen--The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] has 
received indications that the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
[HZDS] is preparing a referendum through which it would like to 
shorten the current president's term of office. Such an attempt 
could lead to doubts being cast on Slovakia in the world and to 
new tension in Slovak society, said P. Weiss, deputy chairman of 
the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NR SR] and chairman 
of the SDL, at a meeting held in Zvolen yesterday with almost 
120 town and city mayors from Central Slovakia who were elected 
on behalf of left-wing oriented parties. Representatives of the 
election coalition--Deputy Chairman S. Krcho of the Farmers 
Movement; S. Holes, a member of the Social Democratic Party of 
Slovakia Presidium; NR SR Deputy A. Chlapikova; and others--were 
also present. 
  SDL Deputy Chairman D. Dorotin said that the left-wing 
partners agreed at the Coalition Council on Wednesday, 8 June, 
to go into the elections under the collective name of "Left 
Choice" [Lavicova volba], with a program called "Social 
Democratic and Green Choice for Slovakia," and with a green 
four-leaf clover as its symbol. The political bodies of these 
entities have still to approve the proposal.

  [Text] Bratislava--At a movement press briefing yesterday, 
Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement 
[KDH], said that, in conversations with him, his foreign 
partners have expressed the view that, if Meciar's Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections in Slovakia, the 
process of the Slovak Republic's integration into European 
structures will be slowed down. In reply to a question from 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA on whether he thinks it is democratic for 
foreign states to influence Slovak voters, he said that these 
countries have the right of veto in admitting new members into 
the European Union and that we cannot prevent them from doing 
this. In reply to other questions from SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, 
which has obtained information that government members have 
increased their salaries without the agreement of parliament, he 
said that this is not true, and, in reply to a question on 
whether he thinks it is right that the government has exempted 
the daily NARODNA OBRODA from tax, he said that he knows nothing 
about it. He did not rule out the possibility of forming a 
postelection coalition with the Party of the Democratic Left. 
He said apropos of the HZDS: "A coalition with Chairman Meciar 
is not being taken into consideration for the KDH."

<F P=106> [Article by "bog, jam": "Deputies Approved Amendment to </F>
Referendum Law"] 
  [Excerpt] Bratislava--[passage omitted] After the lunch 
break [at the 8 June meeting of the National Council of the 
Slovak Republic], parliamentary deputies approved with comments 
the Statutes of the National Property Fund [FNM] of the Slovak 
Republic, which define the powers of the FNM Presidium and the 
FNM Supervisory Board. The approval of new FNM statutes was 
necessary because the amendment to the law on large-scale 
privatization from the beginning of this year substantially 
changes the FNM's legal status. At the same time, the deputies 
approved an amendment to the law on bankruptcy and settlement, 
under which the FNM's property is excluded from the law's 
jurisdiction. 
  In a secret ballot, the deputies then elected the ninth and 
last member of the FNM Presidium. It is Emil Hubinak, who had 
been nominated by the Democratic Union. Blazej Krasnovsky, 
candidate of the Christian Democratic Movement, was elected 
chairman of the FNM Supervisory Board, and Gregor Danisovic 
(candidate of the Party of the Democratic Left) and Jan Lukacik

  [Excerpt] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova 
briefed journalists at a regular news conference about this 
morning's signing by the representatives of the government and 
the Slovak National Bank of the letter of intent for the IMF's 
standby loan. The letter of intent was sent to IMF Managing 
Director Michel Camdessus. The attention of journalists at the 
brief news conference focused on the commitments arising from 
this document for Slovakia. Our radio was represented by Ivan 
Samel. 
  [begin Schmoegnerova recording] The letter of intent 
incorporates economic policy intentions for 1994 and 1995, which 
include a budget deficit of 4 percent for 1994 and a GDP rise of 
3 percent for 1995. Our further aim is to hold inflation at 10 
percent in 1994 and at 8 percent in 1995. Another of our 
macroeconomic aims is to maintain the internal convertibility in 
1994 and 1995, with the proviso that, by 1 January 1996, we will 
have prepared a so-called full internal convertibility of the 
current account of the balance of payments. 
  Apart from these macroeconomic intentions, or rather the 
government economic policy aims, the letter of intent also 
contains measures related to financial policies, the external 
financial sector, privatization, the financial restructuring of 
enterprises, and the building up of the financial sector.

  [Text] Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and General Michael Rose, commander of the 
UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, held 
talks in Sarajevo today on the possibilities of reaching a 
political solution to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the 
situation on the lines of separation. After the meeting, Prime 
Minister Haris Silajdzic told journalists that we cannot expect 
a complete peace in our country as long as the borders with 
Serbia and Montenegro are open. Until control is established 
over these borders, we will not have peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, our prime minister pointed out among other 
things. Mirela Hukovic has the details: 
  [Begin Hukovic recording] After their meeting today, Gen. 
Rose and Haris Silajdzic gave statements for domestic and 
foreign journalists. Gen. Rose said the following: 
  [Rose, in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] I talked with the prime minister about the latest 
development of events along the lines of separation. I must say 
that I am encouraged by the development of events. We only had 
one or two cases of truce violations and that number is not 
increasing. Recently I visited (?a certain) number of positions 
in the sensitive regions. I think that it is very calm and I 
hope that (?it will stay) [word indistinct]. 
  [Silajdzic] [words indistinct] also talked about the 
solution -- a political solution, of course -- and I told 
General Rose again [word indistinct] we cannot expect a complete 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina as long as the borders with Serbia 
and Montenegro are open. Until control is established over 
these borders, we will not have peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If 
the regime in Belgrade says -- and it does say so -- that it has 
nothing to do with the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then why does 
it not allow these borders to be controlled? (?There is this) 
Resolution 838, the Security Council resolution, we have to 
implement that resolution, and then we can begin to seriously 
talk about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We posed the question 
again of what to do if representatives of the aggressor 
(?refuse) any peace solution and whether we shall -- as we did 
after the (?London) conference -- say that [words indistinct] or 
we shall [words indistinct]. 
  (?In my opinion), the international community has several 
things to chose, from ranging from increasing the sanctions to 
lifting the embargo [words indistinct] control of borders. I 
think that the control of the borders with Serbia and Montenegro 
is the key to peace not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but also in 
the entire region. Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] Brcko, 13 Jun (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croat forces and 
the Croatian Army shelled Krepsic 10 km west of Brcko at around 
1300 today, firing twelve 82 mm mortar shells from the direction 
of Vucilovac, the press center in Brcko said today. Croatian 
forces opened strong infantry fire on Covic Polje 8 km southwest 
of Orasje from the direction of Matici at around 0900 this 
morning. 
  The republic of Srpska army units did not respond because 
the 
attacks had no serious consequences. Muslim forces also 
launched attacks on the southwestern part of the Brcko front, 
targeting Serbian positions but also without consequences for 
the Serbian side which did not respond. 
  According to Serbian military sources, the attacks indicate 
that the Croatian and Muslim forces have no intention of halting 
their operations against the Serbian defense lines in Posavina, 
and that in this way they will try to create conditions to 
realize the goal for which they have been massing troops in the 
area over the last few months -- to capture Posavina and link 
Croatian and Muslim territories through this area.

  [Text] Zvornik, June 13 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Croats and 
Muslims continue violating the latest truce by repeatedly 
attacking the territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic, Bosnian 
Serb military sources said on Monday [13 June]. The truce was 
signed by the Bosnian belligerents in Geneva last week and came 
into effect at noon on Friday. The same sources told TANJUG's 
reporter that the Croats had stepped up attacks in northern 
Bosnia and that Muslim provocations had been reported in many 
areas. 
  Bosnian Croat forces and regular army troops of neighbouring 
Croatia continuously opened fire from small arms along the 
entire line of separation in the area of Orasje, a Croat enclave 
in northern Bosnia. Croatian artillery also shelled Serb 
settlements and the town of Brcko. The Serb side lodged a 
strong protest with the U.N. command and special U.N. envoy 
Yasushi Akashi, warning them that the attack on the Bosnian Serb 
Republic from Bosnian and Croatian territory might have serious 
consequences. 
  The Muslims were opening fire from small arms and tanks on 
Serb positions in the areas of Gradacac and Teslic in northern 
Bosnia. Provocative actions, mostly from snipers, directed 
against Serb civilian targets on the right bank of the Drina and 
check points on the line of disengagement were renewed from the 
U.N.-protected Muslim enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. 
  Muslim provocative actions in the areas of Olovo and Kladanj 
in eastern Bosnia also continued, Bosnian Serb military sources 
said and added that a part of the Serb municipality of Zvornik 
had come under Muslim mortar fire. 
  In Sarajevo, Bosnian Serb military sources reported sporadic 
Muslim sniper and infantry fire aimed against the Serb sections 
of Nedzarici and Grbavica, while the suburb of Ilijas was 
shelled by rifle-grenades.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Croatian deputies to the assembly 
of the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a delegation of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna visited Zagreb over the past 
weekend and had talks with Croatian President Dr. Franjo 
Tudjman. The topic of their talks was the establishment of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. What are their impressions upon 
return to Mostar? Zdenko Vranjes has a report: 
  [Vranjes] The Croat-Bosniak federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is to get its government at a session of the constitutive 
assembly on 22 June in Sarajevo. The constitution is to be 
changed at that session in order to regulate the constitutional 
status of mixed cantons in the Neretva river valley and central 
Bosnia which have been agreed upon in Vienna. These are just 
some of the next steps to be taken in the pursuance of 
establishing the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. In order to 
provide complete protection of the Croat interests in all this, 
there should be maximum unity of the Croat deputies ought to 
exist. It is precisely for this unity that the Herceg-Bosna 
government assessed their talks with President Tudjman as 
exceptionally important. What did the Zagreb talks focus on and 
what are the results of the talks? This is what Ivan Bender, 
the president of the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat Republic 
of Herceg-Bosna, is going to tell us: 
  [Begin Bender recording] In the beginning it ought to be 
stressed that this meeting was organized while the delegation of 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna was paying a visit to Zagreb 
on the occasion of Croatia's Statehood Day. Mr. Jadranko Prlic 
and Pero Markovic, chairman of the executive committee of the 
Croatian Democratic Union, led the delegation. 
  A meeting like this one was necessary at this time as it had 
been felt that there were forces trying to disunite the Croatian 
deputies in the constitutive assembly in order to achieve their 
goals -- to wreck the continuity of the Croatian policy on the 
territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  It is interesting to stress that a majority of deputies were 
in attendance as we had taken all the necessary measures, and 
within the framework of all this we agreed what has to be done 
in the forthcoming period: First, we should stress again that 
the federation and its organization is closely connected with 
the establishment of the confederation with Croatia. This is a 
package. Because without the establishment of the confederation 
there can be no federation. This should be clear to all of us 
and it should be repeated that this is a package, that is, in 
practice, a kind of unity about which there should be no 
discussion on this occasion. 
  Further, we should stress again, and we will do so in the 
capacity of deputies at a session of the constituent assembly of 
the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the bodies of the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and Bosnia-Herzegovina itself are 
going to exist until the package which I have mentioned has been 
established. There can be no talk about the suspension of the 
government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, on the 
contrary it should further be strengthened until the federation 
and the confederation have been established, i.e. until some 
other bodies take over responsibilities currently discharged by 
the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. 
  As for the next session of the constituent assembly which is 
to be held on 22 June, we have reached an agreement that we, 
within the Croatian Democratic Union, should carry out all the 
necessary preparations for the election of the government of the 
federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have agreed, as regards 
the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, actually the Croat republic 
of Herceg-Bosna, that the executive committee of the Croatian 
Democratic Union should prepare concrete solutions as regards 
the posts of ministers and deputy ministers. [end recording]

  [Text] As the Press Center of the Army of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina reports, Generals Rasim Delic and Enver 
Hadzihasanovic, commander and head of the Supreme Command of the 
Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina respectively, had 
talks in the UN base in Visoko today with General Michael Rose, 
commander of the UN Forces for Bosnia-Herzegovina, about the 
implementation of the Geneva agreement and the method of 
monitoring the cease-fire. 
  During the meeting, the representatives of the Headquarters 
of the Supreme Command of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina presented a proposal on the deployment of 
observers, liaison officers, as well as the way of maintaining 
mutual communications. It was agreed that in the days to come, 
heads of headquarters should establish places for deploying 
observers, as well as other elements significant for monitoring 
the cease-fire [word indistinct] in the field. 
  Army General Delic insisted that elements for monitoring the 
cease-fire with the Serbian aggressors side should be 
established in the same way and that UNPROFOR [United Nations 
Protection Force] should urgently take more efficient measures 
to stop attacks at the protected zone of Bihac, as well as to 
return the population to the right bank of the Drina River, that 
is, to the protected zone of Gorazde. 
  The (?system of) maintaining the truce on the entire 
battlefield of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be monitored in the same 
way and on the basis of the same criteria, Army General Delic 
said at the end of the talks today, it has been reported by the 
Press Center of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 13 (AFP) -- UN troops in the eastern 
town of Gorazde intervened Monday to avert a clash between 100 
Moslem refugees trying to return to their homes and armed Serbs 
determined to stop them, a UN official said. Around 100 Moslem 
civilians had crossed to the east bank of the Drina River and 
were preparing to march on their homes within a UN- designated 
three-kilometre (two-mile) exclusion zone when 15 armed Serb 
civilians appeared within the zone, Commander Eric Chaperon said. 
  A UN peacekeeping patrol intervened rapidly and sent both 
groups back to their respective zones, Chaperon said. The 
incident "was settled peacefully, but the problem remains and so 
could happen again," he said. 
  Gorazde, designated a "safe area," is home to thousands of 
refugees who were forced out of their homes and villages in the 
region in the early stages of the war in 1992. The exclusion 
zone is off limits to Serb military forces. A truce negotiated 
last week in Geneva came into effect at midday Friday and is 
generally holding, according to UN spokesmen. 
  The planned four-week ceasefire was violated a number of 
times over the weekend. The latest incident was an attack 
Sunday by Bosnian Serbs on a British UN patrol comprising two 
armoured personnel carriers on a frontline near the northern 
town of Maglaj. There were no casualties in the incident in 
which 30 machinegun bullets hit one of the the vehicles. The 
British troops fired back with 80 rounds before withdrawing a 
short distance. 
  General Michael Rose, chief of UN forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, said meanwhile that he was generally 
encouraged by the decrease in fighting, since "nothing stops 
immediately." He said he had visited some of the most sensitive 
frontline areas Sunday and found that things were "fairly quiet."

  [Text] Zagreb, June 13 (TANJUG) -- The U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) confirmed on Monday that Moslems and Croats had 
on Sunday shelled the Serb town of Brcko in the north of 
war-shattered Bosnia, wounding a number of people. A statement 
released at the UNPROFOR command in Zagreb, Croatia, said that 
Brcko had been hit by six shells fired from Bosnian Croat and 
Moslem positions. Authorities in Brcko said on Sunday that the 
town had been hit at 12:02 local time (10:02 G.M.T.) by eight 
shells fired from 128-mm multiple rocket launchers, and that six 
people had been wounded -- five civilians, a child among them, 
and a soldier. 
  The attack was on Monday condemned also by U.N. envoy to 
former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi as a violation of the ceasefire 
agreement signed at Geneva on June 8, all the worse for 
endangering the lives of Brcko's civilians. Akashi said that 
the shells appeared to have been fired from Orasje in northern 
Bosnia, where Bosnian Croat and Moslem troops were now deployed. 
Representatives of the Moslem-Croat federation and Bosnian 
Serbs undertook under the terms of the truce, which took force 
at noon on Friday, to refrain from offensive operations for the 
period of one month. 
  Seven people have died and 46 have been wounded in the eight 
artillery attacks on Brcko in the last month, launched in an 
effort to cut off a corridor which links the eastern and western 
parts of the Bosnian Serb republic and which is at its narrowest 
at Brcko.

<F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Hercegovina, June 14 (AFP) -- Two 
Russian helicopter pilots serving with the Bosnian Serbs have 
defected to the mainly Moslem Bosnian army, bringing their 
helicopter with them. In the first defection of its kind since 
fighting began in Bosnia over two years ago, the two pilots 
landed here near the headquarters of the Bosnian army's Third 
Corps last Wednesday at 3:00 pm (1500 GMT), according to a 
senior officer who wished to remain anonymous. 
  Their Russian MI-17 "HIP" helicopter, painted in the Bosnian 
Serb colours of red-blue-white, was quickly repainted in Bosnian 
army colours and is still making test flights at a Zenica 
barracks. An AFP journalist saw it in flight, two days after 
its arrival. The story was confirmed to AFP by western military 
sources in the sector. The motive of the defectors remains 
unknown. 
  An officer at the barracks, speaking to two western 
journalists Monday morning, confirmed the presence of the two 
Russians but said it was "impossible to see them or speak to 
them without the agreement of the Third Corps command." The 
corp's press service refused to confirm or deny the story and 
said the command was not informed about the affair. 
  Another Bosnian Army officer said the two Russians did not 
plan to stay and fight with the mainly Moslem army, which in any 
case "needs arms rather than men to defend itself." He said the 
two had brought "presents to prove their good intentions," but 
did not specify what the gifts were. 
  The MI-17 is a heavy transport or assault helicopter, a 
valuable catch for the badly equipped Bosnian airforce. A 
western military source said the pilots -- whose motives for 
defecting were not revealed -- arrived from the east, apparently 
from Serb lines in the Mount Vlasic area. They first flew over 
the outskirts of Zenica for a long time, probably to allow time 
to negotiate their defection over the radio, he said. 
  There have been many cases of Russian soldiers fighting 
alongside Bosnian Serb forces, either as mercenaries or 
sympathisers. On May 5 IZVESTIYA interviewed a Russian 
mercenary who said he had served for three years in Bosnia for 
200 deutschmarks (120 dollars) per month.
