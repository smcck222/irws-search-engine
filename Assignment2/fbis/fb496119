  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- Late Tuesday [14 
June] night, beginning with 2245, the trade unions and the 
government started negotiations at the latter's headquarters, 
the Victoria Palace in Bucharest, after a first day of marches 
and rallies staged by the Alfa Cartel and other two large trade 
union blocs. These were joined, the press assessed, by some 
12,000 employees, many of whom travelled to Bucharest from the 
province. 
  The executive was represented at the talks by Labor and 
Social Protection Minister Dan Mircea Popescu, Finance Minister 
Florin Georgescu, Government's Secretary General Viorel 
Hrebenciuc, and Octavian Partenie, the government's liaison 
officer with the employers' and trade unions' associations. 
  The trade union delegation consisted of 15 persons, with the 
Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan Hossu, and his CNSLR-Fratia [National 
Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions] counterpart, 
Victor Ciorbea, at its head. 
  According to a government release, lying at the core of the 
talks was a government ordinance regulating the maximum wage 
fund exempted from supplementary taxation, which the unions 
consider as restricting wage rises. Also of prime importance 
was the subject of the degradation of the purchasing power of 
the common citizens, and wages in the educational system. 
  At 0120 the talks were interrupted and scheduled for 
resumption Thursday, 16 May. After this first round of talks 
Octavian Partenie said that the government made its point of 
view known, to the effect that supplements to the budget 
allocation for education would be approved as soon as the 
economy provided the necessary funds. He also said the 
government consented to resume the talks provided the unions 
called off their rallies. Bogdan Hossu was quoted as saying 
that there was hope that on Thursday positive solutions would be 
found for all the claims. 
  The unions' actions started Tuesday [14 June] morning with a 
rally in Aviatorilor Square and continued with marches along the 
main avenues of Bucharest until the afternoon, when the 
demonstrators returned to Victoriei Square, in front of the 
government's building, where they demanded that a trade union 
delegation be received by Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. The 
first round of negotiations started after long bargaining 
between the sides related to the size of the unions' delegation 
to the talks.

<F P=106> [From the 14 June Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpt] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- The formalities 
for the suspension of President Ion Iliescu from his office, 
initiated by the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party 
[PNTCD], and the ample trade union movements planned for today 
in Bucharest are the central topics of today's press. The 
foreign news pages are dominated by commentaries on the results 
in the elections for the European Parliament. 
  ADEVARUL writes in its editorial: "Among the premieres of 
the democratic political life in this country the recent 
initiative of the PNTCD to start the constitutional procedure 
for the suspension of the president of the republic, counts, 
from afar, as a spectacular one.(...) It comes against the 
background of a general agitation fostered by contradictory 
political statements, by confrontations bordering radicalism, 
and by trade union actions threatening to overflow into the 
streets. In such an explosive setting, the PNTCD's move, which 
formally abides by the law, but comes from politicians only too 
experienced not to know that they stand no chance of winning the 
game, seems to be rather meant to add to the general tension 
with the hope that the disruption it may cause to the present 
political layout could give it the shape desired by them." 
  CRONICA ROMANA carries an article titled "A Romanian 
Watergate?," which says: "The PNTCD's proposal to start the 
suspension procedure will presumably bring the Romanian 
political climate to the boil, and, at the same time, it will 
clarify a number of political alliances.(...) Whatever its 
practical consequences, this end of parliamentary season will 
obviously be extremely tense and with a hard to predict 
denouement." 
  VOCEA ROMANIEI, the government's paper, runs the commentary 
titled "The Rightists' Anti-Presidential Syndrome," saying, 
among other things: "A sudden revival of the right-wing attacks 
against the president of Romania, Mr. Ion Iliescu, is, as it 
appears, the tenor of the Romanian political life these days." 
The paper says that the "morbid lust for destabilization at any 
cost" will collide into the high wall of "a consolidated 
democracy, based on a real reform in full progress, and which, 
alas for them, is something completely different from the vain 
revenging dreams of our post-communist right." 
  About the scheduled trade union actions in Bucharest, daily 
ORA announces: "Today, four years from the events of June 1990, 
the revolutionaries and the miners are on the same side of the 
barricade." 
  TINERETUL LIBER carries the headline "The Capital on Alert," 
and reminds: "Today, 14 June, four years will have passed since 
the bloodiest of the miners' raids, which put an end to the 
marathon rally in the University Square. The capital of Romania 
will again be the scene of wide trade union moves, to be joined 
by the students, too, the great trade union confederations, 
and... surprise, about 3,000 miners. And this is not the only 
trade union action. Almost 110,000 teachers all over the 
country continue their strike blocking the school year, and road 
builders have announced theirs for tomorrow. It was perhaps for 
this reason that Premier Vacaroiu has twice condemned the trade 
unions, once on the radio and then on television, accusing them, 
by what has become a set-phrase by now, of "destabilizing the 
country." 
  CRONICA ROMANA writes: "Even if the prime minister accuses 
the trade unions of trying to destabilize (Romania) through 
their new actions, they said such threats no longer scare anyone 
and therefore they are not going to give up." 
  DIMINEATA carries an article named "Putting on a Solidarity 
for the Occasion, the Trade Unions Will Try Today To Force the 
Hand of the Rulers," says: "The object of trade-unionism is not 
only to claim (with or without aim,) but also to sustain the 
economic construction so as to be able then to staunchly defend 
the social order. The trade unions demand partnership, but it 
is hard to believe that this is to be obtained by hollering in 
the street. The aim would be much more readily reached if, with 
dignity, they would pursue laying all the cards on the table. 
And here, the employers' union and maybe the government are to 
be blamed for part of the failure. As a rule, the middle way is 
always the wisest, and, consequently, the best." 
  ROMANIA LIBERA devotes a special commentary to the events 
four years ago, and finds that "four years have already passed 
since the miners' guided invasion of Bucharest. Then, used as 
instruments for developments of the gravity of which they were 
not aware, they fully contributed to shattering the fragile 
beginnings of Romanian democracy, and to shocking the world by 
nightmarish images relayed by television networks. Nobody has 
so far assumed the responsibility for what happened then, events 
that had such bleak consequences, both at home and abroad, and 
immediate and long-term effects." 
  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI has its own view of those days: "As time 
passes, the thesis that the miners' action was unmotivated and 
erratic has become the axiom of the entire Romanian society. 
The only one who continues to justify the savageries of 14 June 
is Ion Iliescu." 
  ORA devotes its editorial to the Sunday [12 June] television 
interview of Premier Vacaroiu: "The appearance of the prime 
minister on the television screens had the precise aim of 
telling people: Look, we have steered Romania out of the 
crisis, we have brought it to the point where the recovery is 
about to start, and just now strikes, rallies, and 
destabilization are being planned. People have understood how 
the matter stands, they agree with him in principle, but they 
wonder why he has to boast. The invitation to political 
earnestness against attempts to destabilize should not be 
speculated for the benefit of personal, party, or ruling 
interests." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- The leadership of 
the opposition National Peasant Christian Democratic [PNTCD] 
triggered at the end of last week the procedure of suspending 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu from office, its demarche resting 
on a statement made by the Romanian number one three weeks ago 
and termed as anti-constitutional. The PNTCD claims that Ion 
Iliescu sustained that the court decisions on the retrocession 
of houses nationalized 50 years ago should not be enforced, 
since the Parliament was debating a bill that would give legal 
solution to the situation of such houses. His statement was 
branded by the PNTCD as not being consistent with the principle 
of separation of powers. 
  Why did the PNTCD keep silent for two weeks and then come up 
with "an abrupt initiative"? as daily CRONICA ROMANA puts it. 
PNTCD leader Corneliu Coposu explained the delay was meant to 
allow the presidency to deny the allegation, but political 
commentators say that the PNTCD leaders "are too experienced not 
to know they don't stand a chance of success" and consider that 
the real explanation of the initiative ought to be looked for 
elsewhere. The daily VOCEA ROMANIEI attributes to the PNTCD 
gesture what it calls "the anti- presidential syndrome of the 
right". 
  From the PNTCD allies' first reactions, termed by the press 
as "confused" and "puzzled", the political columnists conclude 
that they were not consulted. The constitutional procedure of 
suspending the country's president from office stipulates at 
least two stages to be covered, i.e. the initiative shall be 
sustained by at least one third of the parliamentarians, and 
then, there shall be a majority of votes. 
  Daily ADEVARUL notes that the PNTCD initiative is only meant 
to increase the tension generated by the union actions announced 
for these days, by the parliamentary disputes and by the 
arguments among politicians. The daily opines that the PNTCD 
runs the risk of a "sacrifice of political credit" that can have 
an impact on the opposition as a whole but it mentions that "the 
risk has been assumed". 
  The daily EVENIMENTUL ZILEI assessed in its yesterday's 
editorial that the gesture "has no value" in point of practical 
efficiency, but it can force some clarifications in the current 
political climate, which is consistent with the rules of the 
democratic game.

<F P=106> [From the 15 June Romanian press review] </F>
  [Excerpts] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The need for a 
balance in the Romanian society, marked these days by extensive 
union protests and the celebration of four years since the 
miners' descent to Bucharest on 14 June are the major themes 
covered by the leading press put out on Wednesday, 15 June. 
  The protest launched at the beginning of this week in 
Bucharest by three major trade union blocs, even if ruled by a 
mostly trade-unionist and commemorative character, have turned 
into a protest against the current leadership. 
  Amid street protests, the unilateral initiative of the 
opposition National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] 
to launch procedures to suspend Romania's President Ion Iliescu 
from his office is one more element to fuel tension in the 
political life, according to the press put out today. 
  Daily CURIERUL NATIONAL considers that the PNTCD's 
initiative 
is not only "a political lesson," but also and especially "a 
lesson of inflexibility and radicalism." The daily remarks that 
the history of the past four years shows, among other things, 
that radicalism and inflexibility "have had no political impact 
on the electorate, but rather on the contrary." Examining the 
potential consequences of the PNTCD's initiative, the cited 
daily estimates that by this "a definite end was put to the 
opposition--leadership dialogue," as it "encouraged the 
conservatory group within the ruling party of Social Democracy 
Party of Romania [PDSR] to assert that the opposition is an 
enemy to fight with" and opened prospects for the ruling party 
to consolidate ties with its current allies. Moreover, the 
daily considers that all these would have as potential 
consequence a speedy access of the National Romanian Unity Party 
[PUNR] to ruling, for under the newly created circumstances, 
this party "seems an ideal partner in governing." 
  Daily DIMINEATA writes that "the initiative launched by 
PNTCD 
leader Corneliu Coposu is in fact his own epitaph." The daily 
notes that it is not a serious fact that the PNTCD leader 
imagined that he could find two thirds of the parliamentarians 
"to embrace his aberration," and that "by this he sets himself 
in the service of our country's enemies, who are now seeing 
themselves with their lands and enterprises returned as their 
property rights." 
  Several dailies publish and comment on the communique issued 
by Romania's presidency in which the accusations brought to 
Romania's number one [President Ion Iliescu] are viewed as 
"ungrounded." [passage omitted] 
  Government daily VOCEA ROMANIEI publishes views of several 
parliamentarians on the initiative launched by the PNTCD leader, 
which they view as "a hit below the belt on democracy," an "at 
least hazardous action," or "a bluff." 
  The dailies also inform that at yesterday's meeting of the 
opposition Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] leaders and 
leaders of the Democratic Party [PD] a conclusion was reached to 
stop the procedure for President Iliescu's suspension from 
office and to invite the president to face Parliament and 
clarify the disputed aspects. This step is viewed by the 
editorialist of daily CRONICA ROMANA as "wise" or as "the most 
logical and democratic alternative under the given 
circumstances." On the other hand, the opposition is furthering 
its radical efforts on the much disputed issue of the draft bill 
on nationalized houses, daily ADEVARUL informing its readers 
that it is possible for the opposition to totally withdraw from 
Parliament, according to an announcement made yesterday by 
Gyorgy Frunda, senator of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [UDMR]. 
  Under the headline "Union Protests at European Standards," 
government's daily VOCEA ROMANIEI extensively comments on the 
protests launched yesterday in Bucharest. The daily remarks the 
observance of public order, the civilized articulation of the 
various claims, mostly economic ones, and the openness for 
dialogue. Daily CRONICA ROMANA welcomes the fact that no 
violence was used by demonstrators yesterday. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The Government of 
Romania approved in its Tuesday, 14 June, meeting a resolution 
for the reorganization of the national news agency ROMPRES. The 
reorganization of ROMPRES is required by the need for a clearer 
definition of its objectives and for the improvement of its 
activities; for the need to provide it with the necessary 
juridical status and functional pattern in tune with the 
importance of a public institution of national interest. 
  The government resolution spells the importance of the role 
and duties the national news agency ROMPRES has in ensuring a 
prompt and objective conveyance of information to both the 
Romanian and foreign press, and its provisions pursue to 
stimulate the agency's participation in the information flow in 
Romania and to enhance its cooperation with the national and 
international press agencies. 
  The resolution defines the national news agency ROMPRES as a 
public institution of national interest, financed by the state 
budget and operating at the legal and financial standards valid 
for all budget-subsidized institutions. 
  ROMPRES carries out its attributions free from any 
ideological, political, or economic influences or partiality 
likely to impair the accuracy of the information it releases. 
  In order to adequately fulfill its attributions, ROMPRES is 
authorized to request press information from state institutions, 
ministries, and other bodies of the central and local public 
authorities. 
  ROMPRES staff are entitled, in the exerting of their duties, 
to legal protection, in similar conditions with any civil 
servant. The specialized staff engaged in activities specific 
for the press have the rights and duties as devolving upon them 
from the profession of journalist, and, as such, are entitled to 
the protection of the law. 
  The general director of the national news agency ROMPRES is 
appointed by the prime minister, his position being equivalent 
to that of a secretary of state.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 14/6/1994 -- "We have succeeded 
in the first four months of this year to ensure a monetary 
stability absolutely necessary for the country to gain more 
credibility, to build confidence of domestic and foreign 
investors in the national currency, and initiate several 
privatization actions," Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu 
said during a television interview. 
  "Over the same period we have managed to curb inflation by 
50 
percent and, from latest statistic data available, inflation is 
expected to go farther below by 5 percent, that is much better 
than estimated for the first five months," Premier Vacaroiu said. 
  "In the ensuing months inflation should have to go below by 
about 1 to 3 percent, according to governmental forecasts, which 
would mean a powerful cut on interests and a better economic 
growth," is the opinion of the Romanian premier. 
  Showing that the executive has attached special importance 
to 
further the process of economic restructuring and privatization, 
Premier Vacaroiu showed his discontent over the fact that the 
pace of this process is not as previously estimated, "two 
hundred privatized companies this year is still a small number." 
  Concluding his interview, Premier Vacaroiu mentioned that 
economic forecasts for this year are envisaging "an industrial 
production growth of about 2 percent and a growth of the gross 
domestic product by 1.5 percent, under the circumstances of a 
rate of inflation that would not exceed 70 percent, a possible 
fact as we have so far followed in the steps we planned."

  [Excerpt] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- The Romanian 
Foreign Ministry considers in a statement released in Bucharest 
that the recent decision of the North-Korean authorities to quit 
the International Atomic Energy Agency as well as the 
declaration of its intention to give up its position as party to 
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, are of a nature to render the 
settlement of the extant issues more difficult. 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Mircea Geoana told the press on 
15 
June that the Foreign Ministry "follows with worry the evolution 
of the situation in the Korean peninsula, the mounting tension 
and risk of conflict in the zone." He showed that Romania 
advocated a political solution for the whole of the problems in 
the Korean peninsula, resulted from negotiations among all 
parties concerned. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 13/6/1994 -- Romanian Minister 
of Foreign Affairs Teodor Melescanu is going to visit Denmark 
and Finland in order to analyze the stage of Romania's relations 
with the two countries, with a special stress on the economic 
issues. 
  Before leaving for Denmark, the Romanian foreign minister 
said his visit in the two northern countries was an "obligatory 
leg" in a process of opening the bilateral relations, 
considering also the fact that Denmark and Finland are both 
members of the European Union. The Romanian chief diplomat 
referred in his statement to Romania's interest in matters 
concerning agriculture, food industry, and environment 
protection, economic fields in which the two countries are very 
advanced. 
  "It is a first good-will mission within an official visit 
aiming to review the things that we have accomplished together 
-- rather few so far -- especially in the economic field," said 
Minister Melescanu. 
  The Romanian foreign minister is paying an official two-day 
visit in Denmark on June 14-15, at the invitation of his 
counterpart, Niels Helveg Petersen. On June 16-17, the Romanian 
chief diplomat will be visiting Finland at Mr. Heikki Haavisto's 
invitation. Minister Teodor Melescanu is scheduled also to 
attend the Crans Montana forum in Switzerland, on June 17-18.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 14 (CTK) -- As President Michal 
Kovac has caught flu, he has canceled some events planned for 
this week, presidential spokeswoman Anna Turenicova told CTK 
today. Kovac was scheduled to visit East Slovakia and open a 
branch of the Presidential Office in Kosice, East Slovakia. As 
the illness is not serious, "his visit to the United States, 
planned for next week, will take place," Turenicova added. 
  Along with his Hungarian counterpart Arpad Goncz, Kovac will 
be presented the prestigious award of the Institute for 
East-West Security Studies (IEWSS) on June 22 in New York. They 
have been conferred the award for their remarkable contribution 
to international cooperation and understanding between the two 
countries' nations and effort to settle ethnic problems.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik hailed the results of Sunday's [12 June] referendum in 
which Austria voted for European Union (EU) membership as "very 
positive" today. 
  "What happened in Austria can help us succeed in our efforts 
to join the EU," he told CTK. 
  The vote was also welcomed by the Slovak Foreign Ministry, 
which issued a statement saying that Austria's path was "in many 
ways a source of experience for Slovak foreign policy, whose 
strategic aim is full EU membership." It also expressed interest 
in intensifying Slovak-Austrian relations as a "prototype for 
Slovakia's relations in an integrated Europe." 
  By voting to join, Austria had assumed not only the right to 
take part in joint decision making in the EU but also the 
responsibility of deepening European integration, the ministry 
said.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- The Slovak coalition 
government has not yet agreed on how to fulfill its pledges to 
the Council of Europe and the Hungarian minority parties in 
government nor on how to implement the screening law in 
practice, Premier Jozef Moravcik said after the Coalition 
Council session today. Negotiations will continue on Friday [17 
June], he said. 
  Moravcik's cabinet promised Egyutteles [Coexistence] and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) to fulfill two 
pledges it made to the Council of Europe in return for their 
support in government. The first pledge concerned the use of 
Hungarian names in their original form, and has already been 
approved by the Slovak Parliament. The second pledge -- to 
allow the use of bilingual road signs in areas with a sizable 
ethnic minority -- was not approved in a vote two weeks ago, and 
since then the government has not known how to proceed in 
meeting its obligation. 
  Moravcik believes the "road sign bill" should be put before 
parliament again unchanged, given that only one vote was lacking 
in the last vote. The government is in disagreement over 13 
communities named after Slovak historical figures, for which 
certain coalition deputies do not want Hungarian names to be 
used. "If we don't get them (the 76 votes needed) we will leave 
the question to the new parliament," Moravcik said. Elections 
are to be held on September 30 and October 1. 
  The Coalition Council also discussed the screening (or 
"lustration") law, passed by the federal parliament in 1991, 
which forbids communist-era functionaries to hold important 
official posts for five years. The law is scarcely applied in 
Slovakia. In spite of much speculation and mutual accusations, 
mainly directed at Economy Minister Peter Magvasi, the 
lustration certificates of cabinet ministers -- revealing 
collaboration or not -- have not yet been published. The 
official reason for the delay is that the law does not specify 
whether lustration should be conducted by the Interior Ministry 
or by the Slovak Security Information Agency, as it has been 
until now. 
  "We did not agree on how to resolve this," Moravcik stated. 
He conceded that debate on amendments to the law was being held 
up by the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the strongest coalition 
party, which wants to abolish the law. He said the matter may 
remain unresolved until the elections. Disagreement within the 
coalition has not reached a scale that threatens the functioning 
of the government, Moravcik said.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava June 13 (CTK) -- Ludovit Cernak, 
former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) and currently 
leader of the government coalition National Democratic Party 
(NDS) and parliament deputy chairman, favours national 
reconciliation between followers and opponents of an independent 
Slovak state. 
  In an interview with the daily SMENA today, Cernak says that 
"an absolute blindness towards the demands of national 
minorities cannot correspond with the real interests of the 
Slovak nation." Since Slovakia has gained its independence and 
thus implemented its statehood, it should be a good father and 
mother for all its citizens. Only when internal stability is 
achieved will Slovakia be able to join the European and world 
communities. We cannot continue to divide ourselves into those 
who were for Slovakia's independence and those who were against 
it. The process of national reconciliation should begin and 
everyone should be included into the process of building the 
Slovak statehood," Cernak says. 
  Referring to his past activities as a SNS founding member, 
Cernak says: "When (former Slovak premier and chairman of the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) Vladimir) Meciar came 
to me and spoke about our possible cooperation I told him that 
he would not be successful with his federalistic statements. It 
was during this talk that the word 'confederation' was used for 
the first time and I then admitted the possibility of 
confederation as a possible compromise between my views and 
Meciar's," Cernak says. 
  However, the SNS has become excessively radical and personal 
interests have ever more prevailed over the interests embedded 
in its manifesto, Cernak says, adding that in the long run, with 
the help of Meciar who actually corrupted the SNS, the radical 
wing in the party gained an upper hand. 
  "I think the fact that the radical wing has managed, after 
our withdrawal, to topple the moderate one will eventually lead 
to the party's suicide," says Cernak who was dismissed as SNS 
chairman and expelled from the party at its congress in February 
after which he and his followers established the NDS. 
  The NDS seeks to gain voters with the idea of national 
reconciliation while at the same time remaining a national- 
orientated party, Cernak says. He says the NDS's programme is 
close to that of right-centre parties', adding that the question 
of whether NDS leaders will accept the Christian Democratic 
Movement's (KDH) offer to run on its slate in the autumn 
parliamentary elections, or whether it will resume talks with 
the Democratic Union (DU) headed by Premier Jozef Moravcik, 
would be decided soon. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bratislava June 11 (CTK) -- The "temporary" 
Slovak Government is preparing a sell-out of the state to the 
foreign capital and therefore it is no wonder that the world is 
applauding the Moravcik government while, at the same time, it 
is warning Slovakia "against the bad Meciar," the pro-Meciar 
daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA writes today. 
  The cabinet of Jozef Moravcik is planning to privatise the 
gas and power industries without bothering about the fact that 
only a rich foreign entity can gain these strategic industrial 
branches which involve practically no profit risk, the paper 
stresses. It adds that the government has also approved 
standard-method privatisation projects for spas while it is 
beyond doubt who will be given priority in the sell-out of the 
natural wealth. 
  The author of the commentary claims that Jan Carnogursky, 
Milan Knazko and other politicians "have information" that 
foreign countries will not support Slovakia's integration into 
the European Union if Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) wins the autumn early elections. All 
of them are warning the Slovak public -- do not vote Meciar, 
else Europe will not accept Slovakia. 
  The temporary government wants to place this country again 
in 
the hands of foreign lords. "Won't we become tenants in our own 
country after the half a year of its rule," the paper asks.

  [Text] Tirana, June 14 (ATA) -- The group of the Dutch 
diplomats, headed by the secretary of the Netherlands's Embassy 
in Belgrade, Stela Roner, recently visited Prizren, a city in 
western Kosova. The leaders of the LDK [Kosova Democratic 
Alliance] branch in Prizren familiarized them with the grave 
situation of the Albanians and savage police repression against 
them. The Dutch diplomats concerned themselves especially about 
the needs and possibilities of sending aid, particularly to 
those in the field of education and information.

  [Excerpts] Bratislava 14 June (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
"The cabinet of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar was not defeated by 
poor economic results but by the power-thirst of politicians 
from the ranks of the former government coalition," the daily 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, published by Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), writes. However, political entities 
which have emerged as a result of the breakup of the two former 
government coalition parties -- the HZDS and the Slovak National 
Party (SNS) -- are built on an "unsure footing" and have no 
voter base, the paper adds. 
  The Democratic Union (DU), which emerged from the HZDS, as 
well as the National Democratic Party (NDS), established by 
members of the anti-Meciar wing within the SNS who later 
withdrew from the party, "had nothing but to join the government 
in March and begin to carry out their pre-election campaign for 
state money," the paper says. 
  "The ministers rushed after voters and in order that their 
paths are not too obvious they came up with the government 
programme," the author says. 
  Politicians from the other parties and movements who only a 
year ago spoke about turncoats with disrespect, now willingly 
offer them cooperation. However, the first ones are maneouvring 
in search of the most advantageous positions for themselves, 
their declared programme notwithstanding, the paper says. 
  While as recently as a year ago Democratic Party Chairman 
Pavol Hagyari criticised NDS Chairman Ludovit Cernak for turning 
quite of a sudden from a nationalist to a conservative (Cernak 
was dismissed as SNS chairman and expelled from the party at its 
February congress for holding a moderate position) today Hagyari 
readily offers Cernak a coalition, the paper says. 
  However, Cernak, who does not believe in miracles, has 
instead grabbed the more stable slate of the Christian 
Democratic Movement (KDH). Only elections will show whether his 
move was correct. The latest public opinion polls show that Jan 
Carnogursky's KDH does not enjoy the support of even five 
percent of voters, the author asserts. 
  If someone thinks that there is a rush on the Slovak 
pre-election political scene then it is only appearance. The 
leaders of some parties simply want to wake up only after the 
elections, the paper concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 13 (CTK) -- The National 
Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) leadership failed to 
decide today whether it would seek a coalition with other 
parties of the right in advance of the Slovak general elections 
on September 30 and October 1. The parties the NDS-NA might 
unite with are the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), led by 
Jan Carnogursky, and the Democratic Union (DU), led by Slovak 
Premier Jozef Moravcik. 
  NDS Deputy Anton Hrnko said the Executive Committee had 
requested the party leadership to come to a definitive decision 
by Saturday's meeting of the NDS Central Council. 
  The KDH, which is the second largest party in the coalition 
government, has stipulated that, while the NDS-NA can field 
candidates jointly, the NDS-NA could only form a separate 
deputies' group in parliament if the KDH received 16 percent of 
the vote. Polls indicate this is not likely. 
  Hrnko said the NDS-NA therefore preferred joining forces 
with 
the DU. The DU has been reluctant to offer the NDS-NA joint 
candidacy but now there are signs of change in the party 
leadership, Hrnko said. "We want to prevent a re-run of the 
situation at the elections the year before last when most of the 
votes were divided between the splintered right, which aided the 
anti-reform groups," he said. 
  It appears probable the KDH will go it alone in the 
elections. If so it is expected to reap between eight and ten 
percent of the vote and can therefore count on seats in 
parliament. 
  Negotiations should resume with the DU on the possible 
formation of an electoral coalition. The DU is a breakaway 
group from ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The NDS-NA was formed by the 
"anti-Meciar faction" within the Slovak National Party (SNS), 
which was in coalition with the HZDS before the government fell 
in March. 
  The non-parliamentary coalition of the Democratic Party (DS) 
and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) has 
uncertain prospects of getting into parliament.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- National Democratic 
Party (NDS) Chairman Ludovit Cernak today told journalists that 
Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik proposed last Thursday [9 June] 
that NDS leaders run in the early parliamentary election, 
scheduled for this autumn, on the slate of the Democratic Union 
(DU) of which he is chairman. Cernak said that talks between 
the two parties continued and a NDS leaders' solution was 
expected on Saturday [18 June]. 
  "Since cooperation with the right of center parties had 
always been more important for the NDS than its cooperation with 
the Christian Democrats we decided to cancel talks with the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH)," said Cernak, who as 
recently as this Saturday held talks with the KDH on probable 
participation of NDS candidates on its slate. 
  He said that the KDH's proposal did not satisfy the National 
Democrats as their five candidates would gain places in 
parliament only if the KDH won 16 percent of voter support, 
which is unlikely. 
  Cernak said that the possibility of a joint slate for right 
of center parties was taking shape because the right-wing bloc 
of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak 
Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) was also holding talks on 
cooperation with Moravcik's party. Nevertheless Cernak did not 
confirm that the talks with the KDH had been stopped. 
  According to the May poll conducted by the FOCUS agency 5.9 
percent of voters would vote for Moravcik's DU if elections were 
held now, which is sufficient to enter parliament, while the 
potential partners of the right of center coalition would not 
get in parliament independently -- the DS enjoys the support of 
3.6 percent of the respondents, while the popularity of Cernak's 
National Democrats did not cross the three-percent border. 
(Five percent voter support is required for a party to enter 
parliament according to the recently passed Slovak election law).

  [Text] Bratislava, June 14 (CTK) -- The conclusion of a 
coalition agreement between Slovakia's two ethnic Hungarian 
parties Egyutteles [Coexistence] and the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement (MKDH), has so far been hampered by the 
different positions on their alliance with other groupings. 
  "The agreement on close cooperation and coalition between 
Egyutteles and the MKDH is ready to 95 percent. We only could 
not reach consensus on whether or not the coalition should be 
open for other political groupings," Egyutteles Chairman Miklos 
Duray told CTK today. Egyutteles has 9 and the MKDH 5 deputies 
in the 150-seat Slovak Parliament. 
  Duray pointed out that on Monday [13 June] his movement had 
acceded to the MKDH demand that a twin-coalition be established 
before launching negotiations with the non-parliamentary 
Hungarian Civic Party (MOS) and the Hungarian People's Party 
(MLS). 
  However, given electoral law provisions on electoral 
thresholds, only an offer of a triple coalition or participation 
of the two remaining ethnic Hungarian parties in a common list 
of candidates can be considered, Duray said. "We (Egyutteles and 
the MKDH) will conclude a double coalition and then jointly 
discuss the conditions to be set for other partners," he added. 
  Duray pointed out that according to the prepared coalition 
agreement, the placing of contenders for deputies' posts (on the 
common lists of candidates) was to be decided by lots. "If the 
lot provides for a MKDH candidate to place first, an Egyutteles 
candidate would follow second," he explained. 
  He said that the two movements had also decided to divide up 
their costs "equally". The state subsidy which the coalition 
will receive for votes gained in the autumn elections will be, 
Duray said, divided up "partly equally and partly according to 
the number of seats acquired in parliament." 
  "In its program the Egyutteles movement is also open to 
left-wing non-communist forces," Duray said. However, he 
admitted that the ethnic Hungarian coalition found itself "to 
the right from the center" in the political spectrum.

  [Text] Prague June 15 (CTK) -- "Before the country split 
up on January 1, 1993, the Czechoslovak arms industry was 
conceived as a single unit," Andrej Sabol, Slovak State 
Secretary for Defence says in an interview published in the 
Czech financial daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY today. 
  "The situation altered with the split but even so, it would 
not make sense if the Czech Republic and Slovakia went to third 
countries in search of products that can be produced locally and 
more economically. An eventual agreement hinges on a mutually 
profitable trade deal. Both countries are interested in 
producing arms because of their revenue-raising potential and 
continued world demand for them," Sabol says. 
  As a result of the conversion, the Slovak arms industry now 
works at about eight percent of its original capacity. 
  "We do not want to expand up to the former levels but we may 
consider supplying armies whose specifications are similar to 
ours. Or maybe we could concentrate on upgrading military 
equipment produced in the former Warsaw Pact countries." 
"Another possibility might be the purchase of expensive Western 
technology," Sabol says, adding however that the willingness for 
actual cooperation between Czechs and Slovaks remains to be 
tested. 
  "On inspecting the modernised Czech and Slovak versions of 
tank and talking with experts at the recent IDET 94 military 
technology fair in Brno I felt sure that both sides would profit 
from joining their efforts," Sabol says in the paper, adding 
that both versions could be improved even more if tackled 
jointly. The Slovak version of the T-72 tank was well received 
abroad.

  [Text] Tirana, June 14 (ATA) -- People have to wait in long 
queues up to seven hours to cross the border points between 
Kosova and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM] in Han Elezi and Gllobocica. 
  Serbian forces in this border crossing point exercise a 
severe and detailed control, maltreat and provoke Albanians, get 
their passports under various pretexts, especially as a 
punishment for visits to Albania. 
  After being deprived of their passports, the Albanians are 
sent to jail or punished by very high fines.

  [Text] Prishtina, June 14 (ATA) -- During the last years 
48,000 pupils and 1,200 teachers have been forced to abandon 
their schools and homes in Kosova to escape Serb police 
persecutions. 
  According to reports by the "Naim Frasheri" Albanian 
Teachers' League, during this period, Serbian police have beaten 
and maltreated more than 3,250 teachers, 300 pupils, and a 
considerable number of parents who have not agreed to give up 
Albanian school. The police have killed seven teachers and 
parents. 
  "This organised terror against Albanian education continues 
to escalate, and recently, tens of schoolmasters and directors 
of education institutions have been arrested and kept in jail,"

  [Text] The negotiations that were interrupted at 0130 
between the government team, which includes State Ministers Dan 
Mircea Popescu and Florin Georgescu, Viorel Hrebenciuc, general 
secretary of the government, and Octavian Partenie, head of the 
office in charge of the government's relations with trade unions 
and employers organization, and counselors, experts, and 
representatives of the Alfa Cartel and the National Trade Union 
Block and delegations led by Alfa Cartel Bogdan Hossu, resumed 
shortly before 1500. 
  In the first 15 minutes, the representatives of trade unions 
explained that the minutes of the meeting, which were completed 
last night but not signed, include the government's viewpoint 
but, as far as the viewpoint of trade unions are concerned, 
there are several controversial points. Romulus Nita, vice 
president of the Alfa Cartel, immediately insisted that the 
talks should focus on Government Ordinance Number 13 to find 
ways to invalidate it. At this hour, the talks are in progress, 
our correspondents informed us. 
  Meantime, our correspondent informed us on the phone that 
Victoria Square continues to be occupied by Alfa Cartel trade 
union members. Trade union representatives from Focsani and 
Tulcea have joined the groups of demonstrators. The size of the 
law enforcement units, as well as their technical equipment, 
have also increased considerably.

  [Text] The government spokesman has sent us a communique 
with the following content: 
  During the evening hours, negotiations continued between the 
government commission -- consisting of Dan Mircea Popescu, 
minister of state and minister of labor and social protection; 
Florin Georgescu, minister of state and minister of finance; 
Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government; and 
Octavian Partenie, state secretary and head of the office for 
relations with the employers and trade unions -- and the 
delegation of the Alfa Cartel national trade union 
confederation, headed by its Chairman Bogdan Hossu. 
  During the last round of negotiations, which concluded today 
at about 2000, the government negotiators and the Alfa Cartel 
representatives signed a convention that contains, among other 
things, a number of solutions to the basic problems formulated 
by the union party. 
  They established, in mutual agreement, new ways to implement 
Government Decision 13, which refers to that part of salaries 
for which no additional taxes are to be paid. It was accepted 
that new efficiency indicators will be recognized other than 
those established by Government Decision 171 of 1994, such as 
increases in physical labor productivity, increases in the 
weight of the income earned from exports in the balance of 
companies' total income, and others. 
  Referring to the conclusion of the collective labor 
contracts, the parties agreed that before 22 June 1994 the 
divergent points between the Alfa Cartel and the employers is to 
be mediated by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu. 
  They also agreed upon the finalization of certain draft laws 
with a union connotation and the government pledged to forward 
them to Parliament in emergency procedure. 
  They found solutions suiting both parties on the observance, 
in the case of retirees, of the salary grades acquired between 
1990-1994, as well as a new mechanism of indexing salaries and 
minimal salaries throughout the whole economy. According to the 
convention, minimal salaries are to be increased beginning 1 
July 1994 to 65,000 lei per month, and every three months the 
government, together with the trade unions and the employers, 
will reestablish its level in accordance with the evolution of 
macroeconomic indicators and average salaries in each economic 
branch. 
  The conclusion of the negotiations between the government 
and 
the trade unions, with results that both parties termed 
satisfactory, proves once more the government's readiness to 
dialogue and its realistic way of approaching the problems 
raised by the trade union confederations. The idea ought to be 
reiterated that open dialogue, rather than the pressure of the 
street, represents the sole way of solving all hardships that 
emerge in the evolution of society, concludes the communique 
sent to us via fax by the government spokesman. 
  After the aforementioned convention was elaborated, the 
union 
representatives who had attended the negotiations with the 
government read out the text of that document in Victory Square; 
it was then approved, point by point, by the persons in that 
square. 
  At about 2120 the government party and the union delegation 
signed the convention. According to Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan 
Hossu, the trucks that have been parked in front of the 
government headquarters for the past three days are scheduled to 
leave Victory Square at this time.

a question from BTA regarding reports in certain mass media in 
Turkey, according to which part of the Turkish contingent of 
Blue Helmets is supposed to be transported to Bosnia-Herzegovina 
on civil aircraft flying over Bulgarian territory. 
  In his reply, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman 
stated 
that this issue has not been officially raised with Bulgaria. 
He said that all our neighbors have been repeatedly informed of 
the Bulgarian position regarding the conflict in former 
Yugoslavia. He recalled some of the elements of this position: 
nonparticipation in the conflict, whether directly or 
indirectly, including under the aegis of the United Nations, and 
appeals made to neighboring Balkan states to refrain from 
participation in the conflict. He said that a nationwide 
consensus exists in Bulgaria on this issue, which is shared by 
the political forces, the president, parliament, and the 
government, and no grounds exist for altering this position.

<F P=106> [Interview with Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the National </F>
Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces, by 
DEMOKRATSIYA Chief Editor Panayot Denev; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] [Denev] Mr. Dimitrov, will the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces] give up its boycott of parliament? 
  [Dimitrov] There are no reasons to do this. 
  [Denev] Mr. Stefan Savov, chairman of the SDS parliamentary 
group, and other members of the group have stated that the 
boycott is a great mistake and only makes things easier for the 
Communists.... 
  [Dimitrov] The problem is that the answers are given on 
different planes. If one is referring to slowing down 
proceedings, to parliament not working particularly well, it is 
true that this was achieved to a large degree, even previously. 
In and of itself, the boycott does not slow down proceedings. 
Nevertheless, in one way or another (slowly and with 
difficulty, thanks to our deputies' efforts), the proceedings 
have made progress. Now only 10 clauses of the bill on the 
judiciary remain to be examined. Meanwhile, over 200 clauses of 
this bill gave gone through, including some aimed at 
uncontrolled recommunization, like Article 113. The same is 
true in many other cases. There is no need to mention that 
certain dangerous deadlines are drawing near. In the final 
analysis, we are losing most battles, although we are succeeding 
in delaying them. I cannot be elated that we have postponed the 
next tragedy by one day. This is also tormenting our supporters. 
We are postponing things, but they do not know until when, and 
they ask themselves whether this state of affairs will not 
continue until the end of this parliament's term. In other 
words, they are beginning to suspect that we like this situation 
and have no inclination to alter things. 
  [Denev] Nevertheless, why did you decide on the boycott and 
what will you gain from it? 
  [Dimitrov] First, I would like to make one thing clear: No 
political action, especially in the present situation, carries a 
100-percent guarantee of being successful. Politics includes 
risks, and they are great, especially now. It is childish to 
demand cast- iron guarantees from anyone. The National Assembly 
deputies should not demand this either, they should have an 
excellent understanding of the complexity of the situation. 
  Now, about the boycott. The crisis in Bulgaria is a fact. 
The Constitution has been violated. Because of the actions of 
the majority, the public regards parliament as a negation of 
parliamentarianism. The government is discredited, it has 
received a vote of no confidence, and its policies are rejected 
on a mass scale. Public opinion wants elections. Most of the 
institutions favor elections. Even the Communists [Socialists] 
at their congress found themselves obliged to issue a call for 
elections (albeit in rather vague terms). On the other hand, 
everyone apart from the SDS has his own secret designs: to 
saturate public opinion with stories about elections, while 
gradually slowing the ball down and exploiting the summer 
vacation and the seasonal easing of the economic drama, in the 
final event, to retain the present government or one similar to 
it to carry on with the same policies that are so disastrous for 
Bulgaria. Such a false mitigation of the crisis will have 
ominous consequences, and we must not allow this to happen. 
  [Denev] Will the boycott help to achieve this? 
  [Dimitrov] The boycott is one of the ways. Parliament is 
managing to pass some laws, but tension within it is increasing. 
The Constitution is being violated every day because of the lack 
of a quorum in the plenary hall. The majority is confused, and 
processes of disintegration are under way within it. Certain 
positions are being reassessed. The crisis continues to be 
evident, and this compels them to seek solutions instead of 
"mitigating" the situation. In other words, by itself, the 
boycott is an inadequate means for forcing elections, but it is 
our most effective method of ensuring that the facts of the 
political crisis remain evident, of preventing it from being 
glossed over and consequently gradually sharpening public 
opinion, all the more because in this manner the SDS clearly 
dissociates itself from the absurd conduct of this parliament 
and makes its contribution to future elections. 
  [Denev] Is it not true that some of the laws that are 
being passed in the meantime may cause great harm? 
  [Dimitrov] This is also a matter of opinion. Most of the 
laws that the present parliament is considering were drafted by 
the SDS government of SDS deputies. Now the majority is making 
them dangerous by amending a small number of specific clauses. 
In this way, they change the law into its opposite. Unless 
elections are held, this parliament, with the present majority, 
will inevitably adopt these laws -- a month earlier or a month 
later. If we win the elections (and I personally believe that 
we will have the best chance of doing so precisely now), these 
clauses will be amended immediately, especially if, when the new 
parliament is formed, we make slight changes to the National 
Assembly's rules of procedure so that parliament can operate 
more quickly. 
  [Denev] Why then, precisely, did you assume the 
responsibility of suspending the boycott while the clauses of 
the bill on the judiciary are being considered? 
  [Dimitrov] I think you are asking me this question in the 
wrong way. We are not stopping the boycott. We declared at the 
outset, and the SDS National Coordinating Council approved it by 
vote, that we will enter the plenary hall on all occasions when 
votes are taken that are connected with the fate of the 
government and when the electoral law is debated. (I should 
also say that we will take part then other acts connected with 
the electoral law are being debated, such as the resolution on 
personal files.) However, I insisted also including in the 
formula that we will also enter the hall in the event of a gross 
violation of constitutional order. This is the case with the 
restrictions on magistrates and members of the Supreme Judicial 
Council, which in practice exclude noncommunists from these 
institutions. Under the Constitution, judges cannot be removed. 
This means that they are now aiming to gain control of the 
judicial system for years in the future. This differentiates 
this bill from every other law. Of course, I have no particular 
illusions about the parliamentary majority, despite the outright 
condemnation of this law that is contained in the report of the 
Council of Europe rapporteurs. Nevertheless, I would not want 
the Communists to be able to hide their intentions precisely on 
this issue. Since we will deal with these clauses in the bill 
later, I do not intend to discuss them now, but I repeat: For 
me, violation of constitutional law is the dividing line. 
  [Denev] Is it not strange that you, who were in fact against 
the adoption of this Constitution, are now defending it? 
  [Dimitrov] The Constitution indeed has many shortcomings, 
and recent events prove it. Under this Constitution, we cannot 
even get rid of a government that received an outright vote of 
no confidence. I very much hope that the next parliament will 
make changes in the Constitution, which includes amending it in 
accordance with the principles of the Turnovo Constitution, 
which provides for a sensible division of powers. These 
principles will have to be further elucidated, and I am ready to 
discuss them separately. Otherwise, arbitrary rule is being 
established in the state, and this means that any human right 
may be violated with impunity. This has nothing in common with 
democracy. We must fight against arbitrary rule by all means.

<F P=106> [DUMA PRESS report] </F>
  [Text] Georgi Purvanov, Doncho Konakchiev, Krasimir 
Premyanov, and Yanaki Stoilov were elected deputy chairmen of 
the Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
Supreme Council at the Supreme Council's first meeting on 11 
June. Nikolay Kamov and Klara Marinova are the old-new BSP 
spokesmen. Ten persons were elected members of the BSP 
Executive Bureau. In addition to those 10 members, Zhan 
Videnov, chairman of the BSP Supreme Council, and Nora Ananieva, 
chairperson of the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy 
[PSSD], are also members of the BSP Executive Bureau by virtue 
of the posts they hold. Thus the new Executive Bureau consists 
of 18 members. 
  During the discussion of the membership of the Executive 
Bureau of the BSP Supreme Council, an objection was expressed 
regarding the fact that most of the candidates are people's 
representatives. The proposal to observe the principle of the 
regional representation was rejected. Several candidates 
withdrew their candidacy, others were rejected, and new 
candidates were nominated. The list proposed by Zhan Videnov 
was slightly amended. The new names on this list are Yanaki 
Stoilov, Violeta Ivanova from Pernik, and Miroslav Popov. 
Already at the beginning of the discussion Zhan Videnov stated 
that he had intended to propose Yanaki Stoilov, but was not able 
to meet him and talk to him. Zlatimir Orsov withdrew his 
candidacy for private reasons. Georgi Pirinski also withdrew 
his candidacy in a categorical manner and explained this by the 
fundamental differences in anything related to the party's 
economic policy. 
  Ivelin Nikolov, chairman of the BSP Gabrovo City 
Organization, reported the wish of the BSP Gabrovo organization 
not to elect Krasimir Premyanov as a member of the Executive 
Bureau because of his work style. According to Nora Ananieva, 
certain changes in the PSSD leadership could be expected because 
several members are also members of the Executive Bureau and 
thus they would be too busy. 
  The participants in the plenum of the BSP Supreme Council 
elected the BSP Supreme Council leading organs -- 15 commissions 
and their leaderships. The commission chairmen will propose 
their memberships. After a discussion by the Executive Bureau 
they will be approved by the Supreme Council at one of its next 
meetings. 
  The BSP Supreme Council instructed the Executive Bureau to 
make the necessary changes in the BSP registration which spring 
from the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress, in accordance with 
Article 10 of the Political Parties Bill. 
  The BSP Supreme Council instructed BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov 
to prepare a draft program for the Supreme Council's work during 
the second half of 1994, which will be discussed at the next 
Supreme Council plenum, at which the BSP structure, budget, and 
payroll will also be updated. 
  After the plenum the new membership of the Executive Bureau 
met. On 14 June the Executive Bureau will issue its general 
assessment of the congress' work, spokesman Nikolay Kamov said.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksandur Marinov, chairman of the </F>
Bulgarian Socialist Party Sofia (BSP) City Organization, by 
Teodora Encheva; place and date not given: "41st BSP Congress 
Was Rigidly Staged"] 
  [Text] [Encheva] Mr. Marinov, were you definitely 
defeated by Zhan Videnov? 
  [Marinov] (Laughing) I do not think your question is 
precise. There was no duel between me and Zhan Videnov even from 
the formal point of view. The contest simply did not take 
place. It was not allowed. 
  [Encheva] But you yourself opened the duel. 
  [Marinov] On the contrary, such an impression was 
deliberately created to use it as a pretext of staging an attack 
against myself and my colleagues from the Sofia organization. I 
would like to say that I am rather concerned with the artificial 
lack of alternatives. This is something that does not speak 
well of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], because the party 
did not do the necessary for having a normal, nonviolent contest 
at the congress. This was a consequence of the congress' spirit. 
The real problems were evaded and there was a desire to proceed 
in a smooth manner, occasionally, amidst staged applause. 
Personally, I use very cautiously the concept "definitely," and 
view ironically any attempt to speak on behalf of history. 
  [Encheva] Who was the stage director at the congress? 
  [Marinov] The old leadership. This was a skillfully 
manipulated congress, which returns us very much to the past. 
everything was reduced to resolving the personnel issue. 
However, the critical discussion should not have been 
eliminated. I am disappointed, because I thought that the 
changes in the BSP are irreversible. 
  There was a strict staging of the statements. The principle 
of giving the floor in accordance to the order of requesting it, 
was not observed. There was an extensive preliminary campaign 
in the media, including our party organ, which had the task of 
creating a negative attitude toward certain organizations and 
people, and then there was the entire technical organization of 
the congress itself. 
  [Encheva] Why were you the only candidate against Videnov? 
What happened to Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, Georgi 
Purvanov.... 
  [Marinov] Well, I suppose that when certain people saw what 
happens, they lost their desire to compete. 
  [Encheva] Desire or.... 
  [Marinov] So to speak. 
  [Encheva] What do you want now from the BSP? 
  [Marinov] I want a program clarity, a clear face, and less 
general and evasive phrases. Second, I want a decisive rather 
that a simulated orientation toward new elections. In this 
sphere we again are carried away by the wave of strong words. 
Third, I want to expand democracy in the party -- only thus 
would it be possible to expand its influence and allow its 
cadres to develop their potential. Unfortunately, according to 
the charter this is impossible. I cannot understand why my 
proposal to allow the municipal organizations to nominate the 
candidates for National Assembly membership was not accepted. 
  [Encheva] Do you still think that the elections will take 
place this fall? 
  [Marinov] I already have my doubts. I am afraid that the 
elections are a flag that is being waved for different reasons. 
I would be a great disaster for the BSP if it finds itself at 
the rear end of the events, and is forcibly brought to the 
election polling stations. However, there still is a great 
chance that there will be elections in the fall, not because 
someone wants them, but because those are the objective 
tendencies. It would be very bad, let me repeat, very bad, if 
the impression is created that the BSP is afraid of elections. 
I am afraid that such an impression has already been created. 
  [Encheva] Nevertheless, why did you not allow yourself to 
be elected as a member of the BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Marinov] I refused to be a delegate of the Sofia 
organization. Frankly, I sensed the prevailing spirit and 
deliberately assumed a risk hoping that an absurd situation will 
emerge, which will indicate the real situation. 
  [Encheva] Do you think that this was a personal defeat? 
  [Marinov] I consider this to be an injustice. Life has 
taught me to endure defeats, but I have difficulties in 
swallowing injustice. I do not think that political rating is 
something fleeting that emerges and disappears suddenly. 
However, my cause was just and most of my benevolent comrades 
will appreciate this. 
  Personally, I did not expect that so many unworthy means 
would be used in such a scope. What can I do, this is 
democracy.... (laughing) 
  [Encheva] Do you feel betrayed? 
  [Marinov] No. I am sorry that most of the delegates did not 
understand what happened. 
  [Encheva] You did not have a team, is this what you mean? 
  [Marinov] I did not have organized support because I did not 
need a conspiracy. However, I had the support of a large part 
of the Sofia organization and other regions. 
  [Encheva] I did not understand what do you call the division 
in the BSP. 
  [Marinov] Look, the question is whose interests are being 
defended through politics. Obviously, certain internal and 
external economic factors have their influence, and our 
differences constantly increase. I do not say that those 
differences could be completely eliminated, but it should be 
clear what prompts our political steps. 
  Today we should have a much more active social policy -- but 
you see what happens. 
  I think that the ideas of general-democratic reforms are 
rather a cover, because it is clear that the reforms have a 
socioeconomic contents. 
  [Encheva] Will you head an ideological current within the 
BSP? 
  [Marinov] My views coincide with the main ideas vested in 
the BSP draft program, prepared by the Strategic Research 
Center. I would make the step you mention if the adoption of 
the program is prevented. Obviously, an ideological and 
political division will emerge then in the BSP. 
  [Encheva] The referendum on the program will be after 9 
September. Will you wait passively until then? 
  [Marinov] First, we have to elaborate the draft. 
  I am afraid that we will have to overcome a serious 
resistance and attempts to change it in such a way that it would 
lose its authentic ideas. It should be clearly explained to the 
party what is the meaning of the referendum. 
  [Encheva] Do you trust Videnov as a chairman? 
  [Marinov] I cannot answer this question unequivocally. 
  [Encheva] This is prompted by your emotions, right? 
  [Marinov] He is the legitimate chairman, and I observe the 
party charter. However, confidence is something much greater 
than that.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Andrzej </F>
Woyciechowski at the Radio Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of 
Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Text] [Woyciechowski] Radio Zet's guest today is Prime 
Minister Waldemar Pawlak. Good morning to you, Sir. 
  [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is your assessment of the first nine 
months of your term as prime minister? Are you satisfied, 
happy, or tired? 
  [Pawlak] The first months were spent working on the budget, 
and, as everybody knows, the budget solves a whole range of 
issues but not all of them. So now, after this period, now that 
we have reached midyear, we are presenting the "Strategy for 
Poland" program, which is oriented toward the future, primarily 
the next three years, but, on many issues, the program stretches 
out much further into the future. I think that demonstrates the 
entire dynamics of the government's proceedings. If we take 
some specific issues--I mean issues that especially affect those 
people whose lots were the most difficult in the recent time 
period--one must say that, effective 1 January, there was a 
valorization and an increase in the minimum retirement pensions 
and other kinds of pensions, whereas, effective 1 June, a second 
valorization was carried out, which was quite substantial. The 
same applies to salary increases in the budget sector and in the 
production and industrial area. We have been witnessing a very 
positive phenomenon of an increase in production, which this 
time around is a result of our work and our capital potential, 
as well as of foreign investments. The increase is definitely 
not the result of governmental credits or of administrative 
involvement in the economy. This is great cause for joy because 
it creates a stable basis for optimism. 
  [Woyciechowski] But what about you personally, Mr. Prime 
Minister? Are you happy, are you satisfied? I mean you 
yourself, personally. Or, maybe, is the situation not quite 
what it was supposed to be? 
  [Pawlak] Personally, I am a bit tired because the tempo has 
really been very fast, and one must watch oneself the whole time 
so as not to lose pace and [hesitating] to keep up with the rate 
of events we have to solve. I think that, apart from long-term 
issues, there is a whole list of issues that are of an immediate 
nature, there are obstacles and problems--these constitute a 
permanent aspect of operating on this level. This applies to a 
wide variety of issues, and I think that.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] When you say immediate 
problems, you must certainly also mean the strikes in the 
metallurgy industry that are now taking place. Yesterday and 
the day before that, you said something that caused some big 
excitement, especially among the Western press--namely, you said 
that, in your view, the strikes are caused by foreign factors. 
What did you mean? Did you mean that.... 
  [Pawlak] You know, this is exactly the difference between 
information and interpretation. I did not talk about such 
foreign connections. All I said was that it is an 
extraordinarily amazing coincidence, and, if reporters could 
only prove that I really meant something more than that, I think 
it would be very interesting. But such interpretations are a 
little too farfetched. It is beyond dispute that, as far as the 
world market goes, and especially the European market, there are 
big surpluses in steel production.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, it may be in 
the interest of somebody out there for Poland to be going 
through these strikes? 
  [Pawlak] I would put it in different terms: Others are very 
happy to see the strikes in our country because thanks to them 
they can sell their products with greater peace of mind, they 
have jobs, employment, salaries, and incomes guaranteed for 
them--for both employees and owners of steelworks. 
  [Woyciechowski] So, if my understanding is correct, what you 
did is appeal to the sense of patriotism rather than accuse 
imperialism of conducting strikes in Poland? 
  [Pawlak] You know, I can see you are going back to some 
notions from the previous era in Poland, and that is amazing to 
me. But, first of all, one must keep in mind that, in any game, 
it is mighty important not to score in your own goal, and, when 
it comes to the issue of the strikes, we are scoring quite 
effectively not once but several times in our own goal, and we 
thus give up on the rest of the game. As far as the resolution 
of such disputes or conflicts is concerned, it is definitely 
easier to solve those disputes when there is a lot of emotion 
involved, rather than with tough and concrete negotiations. 
Such an agreement was indeed concluded at the Katowice 
Steelworks. It also included salary raises, and it was signed by 
all of the trade unions except the one that initiated the strike 
in the first place, but it had relatively few members in the 
steelworks.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean the August '80 
trade union? 
  [Pawlak] Exactly. What is also interesting is that, a few 
weeks before that, the steelworks obtained guarantees for a 
major modernization investment concerning a continuous steel 
production unit and.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But it can almost be concluded 
from what you are saying that this is indeed a political strike 
and that somebody wanted to spite the government and the 
coalition. 
  [Pawlak] You know, the situation there was very weird 
because, apart from all the seriousness and....[pauses] What is 
a difficult situation down there, there are some aspects that 
are quite amusing: In the steelworks, which is an enterprise 
for which these people have been working for many long years, 
there is this very amazing situation where the steelworks' 
management is in one building, there is a protest committee in 
another building, and there is Sejm Deputy Zajac of the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] shuttling as an envoy between 
these two serious institutions. This looks quite amusing. It is 
as if the parties involved could not find a way of communicating 
with one another. After all, given that they fail to come to an 
agreement at the level of the steelwork, what could be the use 
of an outside observer or mediator? After all, these are issues 
related to the metallurgic industry and of the particular 
enterprise in question. The point on the one hand is not to lead 
the steelworks into ruin, and, on the other, to secure the 
possibilities of obtaining higher incomes for the people. Last 
year, the steelworks achieved an overall positive financial 
outcome, which is very important and very positive after a few 
years of quite difficult times. But now the steelworks are 
getting in trouble on their own request. 
  [Woyciechowski] How will this all end? Will you decide to 
close down the Katowice Steelworks if they continue to lead 
themselves into bankruptcy? 
  [Pawlak] Remember that there is no central management 
anymore.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] It is not up to you to close 
the steelworks down? 
  [Pawlak] The people down there are really building a future 
for them on their own, and they themselves are creating the 
conditions for the enterprise to either score success or to lose 
on the market and drop out of the race. 
  [Woyciechowski] Concerning Kolodko's "Strategy": Do you 
already know at this stage, or do you understand why the 
opposition walked out of the Sejm hall? 
  [Pawlak] Well, I cannot possibly imagine what the reasons 
could have been because, as I recall my parliamentary 
experiences, there were different types of times. There were 
times when we were up against the wall, or even high up the 
wall, but we never tried to leave the Sejm hall altogether. 
Well, that is.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You mean SLD members walked 
out, but members of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] have never 
walked out? Or has it happened at any time in the past? 
  [Pawlak] No, PSL members have never walked out of the Sejm 
hall. Perhaps our situation was a bit more fortunate because 
there have not been speeches that would be so sharp and 
addressed to us. But that....[Pawlak pauses] As far as issues 
such as governmental programs, budget laws, and other similar 
debates are concerned, even though they were hard for us at 
times, we tried to participate to the best of our ability and to 
influence either modification or changes, or we voted against 
when we could not have counted on changes, but this is tough 
work that must be done, and the absent simply do not count. It 
is important for us to be able to concentrate on issues we have 
to face. Regardless of these different maneuvers in the Sejm 
hall, the issues remain to be resolved, anyway, and one must 
simply address them eventually. 
  [Woyciechowski] Was there a small element of an election 
campaign in the decision to present the "Strategy for Poland," 
which was made right before the elections? Or was it just a 
coincidence? 
  [Pawlak] Partially it was a coincidence; if my memory serves 
me well, the elections were supposed to be held on about 29 May. 
However, the Sejm obliged us in the budget law....[Pawlak 
pauses] The resolution adopted when the budget was passed 
obliged us to present a long-term strategy in June. Thus, we 
simply followed the Sejm's order; we wanted to present a 
prospect for several years; primarily, we wanted to put the 
coalition's decisions and agreements in a compact form, which 
would deal with the main issues, the main problems that the 
state and the society are facing. The activities of the 
government or of several high-ranking state officials are not 
enough to put this strategy into effect; what is needed is the 
work and activity of many different milieus. Therefore, we are 
counting on a good substantive discussion in this area, as well 
as on activeness in the practical implementation of this 
strategy. 
  [Woyciechowski] What do you think of the statement by 
Primate Jozef Glemp? When he was commenting on the decision by 
the Sejm concerning abortion, he said that the Sejm was born at 
a time of the state's sickness, and today such a fetus within 
the state is not healthy. You never commented on this in public. 
  [Pawlak] And I do not intend to. This happens to be an area 
where you journalists can show off, and I am not going to do the 
journalists'job here. 
  [Woyciechowski] Sejm Speaker Oleksy protested because he 
interpreted the primate's comment as a statement referring to 
himself and the SLD. Do you think the cardinal also meant the 
PSL, and is that why you have not commented on that? 
  [Pawlak] Well, you know, let us allow those to whom 
statements are addressed to deal with them. Every person who 
listens to such statements, who analyzes such situations, should 
evaluate this issue himself. I am not going to comment on 
statements made by others; everyone has his own opinion, and I 
think the listeners can form their own opinions also. Such 
issues are often decided in the people's own conscience and in 
the behavior of each of us. There are great differences, 
depending on people's individual value systems. Let us leave 
this to the people. Let us allow everyone to evaluate this 
situation... [Pawlak pauses] Because I think it all concerns the 
situation that developed in the Sejm, and not just this 
particular statement. Let us allow everyone to evaluate whether 
the issue is so important that the Criminal Code should be 
applied or that we should rather speak about education and 
schools because this is where the key to resolving this issue 
lies, not in the Criminal Code. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you think the problem of abortion may 
have political consequences? Can it, as some people say, result 
in the weakening of the coalition and in its disintegration? 
  [Pawlak] I do not think so. It is stated clearly in the PSL 
regulations that issues concerning conscience and belief cannot 
be a subject of political discipline.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means that every Sejm 
deputy will vote just as he thinks? 
  [Pawlak] Just as his conscience tells him to vote. 
  [Woyciechowski] Now, what about the concordat? Is the 
concordat an issue that may weaken the coalition? Can this 
bring about any negative effects? 
  [Pawlak] I do not think so. However, this issue is entirely 
different. It is not a problem of detailed legal solutions 
concerning the internal law. It is an international treaty. I 
can only say that recently we have had far more treaties that 
entailed much more serious consequences, especially economic 
consequences, than the concordat. 
  Now, if the issue of the concordat is approached in a very 
substantive and precise way, many doubts can be dispelled. The 
discussion that has been held within the government has allowed 
us to submit it to the Sejm for ratification--with no 
objections. I hope that the debate we will witness in the Sejm 
will be based on a serious and substantive analysis; there is no 
room for emotions or for simple political gamesmanship. Now, 
from the viewpoint of broader and long-term interests, I think 
we must correct all of the mistakes resulting from a certain 
haste when the concordat was being signed. However, this can be 
done in an atmosphere of peace and responsibility. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mistakes were made by the Suchocka Cabinet, 
if I understood you correctly. In other words, the coalition is 
doing fine. You do not fear a conflict within the coalition. 
  [Pawlak] Well, I do not fear a conflict; however, I do not 
deny that there will be various issues that will give rise to 
heated and serious discussions in the coalition. This is 
because we are not going to sacrifice our views simply not to 
step out of line or to achieve unanimity. We will have serious 
discussions concerning which solutions are best. I believe this 
will help us avoid making mistakes. In this respect, the 
coalition is rather dynamic. There are various issues: In some, 
our views are quite similar; however, there are also issues in 
which we must try to work out a compromise; there are also 
issues where we respect each other's uniqueness and 
independence, and we are not going to change each other in this 
area. We believe that, in those issues, both parties have the 
right to maintain their subjectivity and identity. 
  [Woyciechowski] Is there now any conflict with Kwasniewski? 
The press was full of articles about it some time ago. 
  [Pawlak] I do not really know. That is, you know, if a 
topic must be supplied, we can have a quarrel with Kwasniewski 
about some important issue to make.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] To help newspapers increase 
their circulation? 
  [Pawlak] To make it credible. We can do something like 
that; I believe that Mr. Kwasniewski will agree on such a 
solution. However, as I have said, there are issues where we 
differ, but there are also areas where our views are similar. 
If we take a look at the coalition agreement, it includes 
various issues that have been agreed upon. I believe that this 
is the foundation for the coalition's activities. 
  [Woyciechowski] You are speaking about it with great 
self-assurance. This must mean that you are certain this 
coalition will survive at least three years. 
  [Pawlak] I have....[Pawlak pauses] I hope we will be able 
to consistently implement the tasks we have taken on; time is an 
important factor here that allows us to stabilize the situation 
and to resolve a number of problems. 
  [Woyciechowski] What is going to happen in a year and a 
half, when the presidential elections are held? It is already 
known that the list of candidates for president will include 
Lech Walesa. There will also be either Kwasniewski or Oleksy. 
Will the name of Pawlak be on the list? 
  [Pawlak] I think we have many good candidates in the PSL. 
Therefore, a slightly different solution will be implemented. 
My colleagues will be able to prove themselves. 
  [Woyciechowski] That means that the PSL will field a 
candidate? 
  [Pawlak] It certainly will. 
  [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. 
  [Pawlak] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Article by Bogdan Mozdzynski: "Employers in Favor of </F>
`Strategy'"] 
  [Text] Employers say that it will not be possible to 
implement the goals of the "Strategy for Poland," which they 
think are correct, without their participation. 
  Representatives of 42 organizations that are members of the 
confederation of Polish Employers [KPP] and representatives of 
five organizations that are not members of the KPP told Prime 
Minister Pawlak yesterday that the "Strategy for Poland" is a 
document for which they have been waiting for a long time, that, 
in their view, the goals outlined in the program are correct, 
and that they themselves are interested in their implementation. 
<H5>  On Equal Footing </H5>
  During a discussion on the main items of the "Strategy," the 
employers had particularly high praise for the government's 
readiness to form partnershiplike labor relations and 
negotiation-based mechanisms for salary regulation. The 
employers want the state to play the role of an umpire and 
mediator in conflicts between employers and employees. As KPP 
Chairman Andrzej Wilk stated, the implementation of the task 
would make for a rapprochement among those who are most 
interested in seeing conflicts resolved--that is to say, trade 
unions on the one hand and employers on the other. 
  According to Ryszard Bielawski of the Gdansk Employer 
Association, only an economy "based on consultations" can assure 
social peace. Employers will gladly participate in 
negotiations, provided the government approaches them on a 
partnership basis. 
  The prime minister said that employer participation in the 
Trilateral Commission is very significant for putting 
employer-employee relations in order and that the government 
will be "seriously taking employers' views into account." 
<H5>  Let Us Commercialize </H5>
  Many of the employers present stressed the importance of 
commercialization of state-owned enterprises. "It is a good 
thing," they said, "that the issue was mentioned as a `strategic 
problem' in Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko's program." Without 
its successful implementation, it will not be possible to carry 
out the "Strategy." Commercialization implies making the 
enterprises oriented toward market criteria, and "only then will 
employers be stimulated in an appropriate manner." 
  State-owned enterprises currently produce almost half of the 
GNP, while 95 percent of all conflicts occur in them. According 
to Andrzej Tyszkiewicz, manager of the Zeran automobile plant 
and chief of the Federation of Employers of Domestic Automobile 
Producers, employers representing the current and former state 
ownership are more sensitive to social policies than private 
employers. In Tyszkiewicz's view, employers of the enterprise 
to be commercialized will be the leading executors of the 
appropriate labor relations in Poland (meaning relations modeled 
after EU [European Union] countries). 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak responded by saying that he 
can see no obstacles against a speedy commercialization of 
enterprises, even if their current managements were to be 
retained. "They will simply start thinking along different 
lines once they find themselves under market conditions, while 
you are not going to have good cadres emerge from lame 
structures," the prime minister said. He is waiting for a 
unanimous position on this issue by the managing cadres.

<F P=106> [Article by Jolanta Adamiec: "A Difficult Wooing: The </F>
Cooperation Between Poland and the European Union"] 
  [Text] 
<H8>  Foundations of Cooperation </H8>
  Since 1 November 1993, a new and extremely important entity, 
the European Union, has appeared on the European scene. This 
does not mean, however, that it is an entirely unknown organism. 
On the contrary, as a fruit of the continuing development and 
evolution of the European Community, it had long been expected, 
not just by its member countries but also by all partners. As 
such, it also is taking over all of the obligations of its 
predecessor, including those concerning our country. 
  Poland is linked as an associate member to the EC by the 
European Treaty, which was signed on 16 December 1991. An 
agreement of this kind must be ratified by the parliaments of 
all of the member countries of the EC, the European Parliament, 
and the parliament of the concerned country. Poland ratified 
that agreement as early as in June 1992, but its ratification by 
the other countries took much longer. In effect, the agreement 
as a whole became effective as late as on 1 February 1994. 
However, its commercial part [the so-called Interim Trade 
Agreement] had already taken effect on 1 March 1992, and that 
made it possible to implement concessions [by the EC], 
presupposing the establishment, within 10 years, of a zone of 
free trade in manufactured goods. 
  The turning point in the relations between Poland and the EC 
occurred in 1988 upon the signing of the so-called Joint 
EEC-CEMA Declaration, which afforded the possibility of 
negotiating and concluding specific bilateral agreements between 
the Community and discrete countries of Central-East Europe. 
  In practice, since 1973, when the EEC adopted the principles 
of a joint trade policy, that possibility had not yet existed; 
all economic agreements had to be negotiated with the Community 
as a whole rather than with its individual member countries, but 
the CEMA countries refused to acknowledge the supranational 
powers of the EEC on this issue and, pointing to the imbalance 
between the negotiating parties, demanded bilateral agreements. 
At the same time, direct negotiations between the EEC and CEMA 
were impossible because the statute of CEMA did not authorize it 
to act on behalf of its member countries. 
  Owing to the East-West detente, one of whose fruits was the 
signing of the aforementioned "Joint Declaration," that impasse 
could be broken, and, on 19 September 1989, Poland signed its 
first major agreement with the EC concerning trade and economic 
cooperation and, soon afterward, the association agreement 
["European Treaty"] as well. The latter confers on 
Polish-Community relations a totally new quality, such that, 
within a short period of time, the status of our country changed 
from that of the virtual absence of agreements to one that is 
much more favorable than that of many other EC partners. It also 
is a vital factor in the whole of the changes taking place in 
our country; it stabilizes the direction and course of our 
economic reforms by placing them in the context of the entire 
West European system. 
  The range of the issues covered by the European Treaty 
extends from political dialogue (Articles 2-5) through trade 
(Articles 7-36), migration of labor (Articles 37-43), 
establishment of companies (Articles 44-54), exchange of 
services (Articles 55-57), movement of capital (Articles 59-70), 
competition (Articles 63-67), to coordination of legal systems 
(Articles 68-70) and economic (Articles 71-94), cultural 
(Article 95), and financial (Articles 96-101) cooperation. 
Although the very fact of the signing of such a far-reaching 
treaty is advantageous to Poland, not all of the barriers to 
mutual relations could be overcome. Most of these barriers 
pertain to trade relations, and they can by now be more 
concretely identified after the nearly two-year-long 
implementation of the Interim Trade Treaty. As for the other 
barriers contained in the remaining parts of the European 
Treaty, these concern chiefly migration of labor and financial 
assistance. 
  Regarding migration of labor, it was merely settled that 
Polish citizens who are legally employed on EEC territory will 
be treated like the citizens of the host country. Unfortunately, 
it was not possible to incorporate provisions legalizing the 
employment of other categories of Polish citizens residing in 
the member countries of the Community and sanctioning an 
additional quota for Polish employees. Yet, precisely such 
provisions would be most advantageous to the Polish side, given 
the current rising unemployment and the attendant social 
tensions. Another disputed issue was the financial protocol. 
Unlike in the case of association agreements with Greece and 
Turkey, in Poland's case, the agreement merely refers to the 
statutory provisions of PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for 
Poland and Hungary] and the European Investment Bank [EIB]. But 
the EIB offers loans solely on market terms rather than 
financial assistance in the close meaning of the term, while 
PHARE is intended to provide consulting and technical rather 
than financial assistance. 
  All of this reflects conflicting signals from the member 
countries of the Community. Their verbal support for the reforms 
in Poland and other countries of Central-East Europe is very 
strong, but, when it comes to particular decisions entailing 
specific expenses to their own economies, their attitude becomes 
quite detached. What is more, as the EU matures, the rise of new 
barriers relating to a common foreign policy, security policy, 
and trade policy is conceivable. These barriers may prove to be 
particularly detrimental to our aspirations for membership in 
the EU. 
<H8>  The Interim Trade Agreement </H8>
  The Interim Trade Agreement--that is, the trade part of the 
Association Treaty--introduces two basic distinctions. First, it 
treats differently manufactured goods and farm commodities, and, 
second, it introduces differing timetables for the abolition of 
[trade] barriers by Poland and by the Community. The former 
distinction was dictated by the specific conditions of the 
commodity market of the EC, while the latter, termed "the 
asymmetry principle," means that the EC began to abolish import 
barriers earlier and more rapidly than did the Polish side, this 
being intended to give us time to adapt ourselves to the 
conditions of trade on the international market. 
  As regards manufactured goods, the EC abolished the duties 
on 
50 percent of our exports on the effective date of the 
agreement. The pace of the reduction of duties on other goods 
varies for discrete groups of merchandise, as specified in 
detail in the Appendixes to the Treaty, which classify specific 
articles according to Integrated Nomenclature (NC). As regards 
farm products, total liberalization of trade is generally not 
envisaged; all merchandise was divided into six groups, each 
with a different timetable for the reduction of duties and 
countervailing fees as well as for increases in the fee-exempt 
quotas. In every case, however, a major limitation is the 
so-called protective clauses, which provide for restrictions in 
the event of, among other things, dumping, problems with balance 
of payments, abuse of monopoly practices, or broad fluctuations 
on the markets for particular products (farm, textile, steel). 
  Viewed in a broader context, it turns out that the 
concessions granted by the Community are rather limited. Here at 
least three factors should be taken into consideration: 
  --Share in aggregate exports: The longest-lasting and most 
restricted timetable of liberalization was adopted for goods in 
which Poland at present relatively excels (so-called sensitive 
goods) and whose free market access would yield maximum 
advantages; these goods account for nearly 23 percent of Polish 
exports to the EC, or, if allowance is made for textiles and 
steel, about 44 percent. 
  --Existing level of protection: The attendant extended 
process of abolition of barriers applies chiefly to the goods 
for which the extent of protection was the highest in the past 
as well. This means that trade liberalization applies primarily 
to the domains in which anyhow in the past, too, market access 
had been relatively easy. 
  --Possibilities for production: The industries manufacturing 
so-called sensitive goods, which are most affected by the 
recession, have both the largest inventories and the highest 
spare productive capacity, and they are capable of rapidly 
responding to increased export possibilities. 
  Thus, in practice, in the sectors in which the extent of 
protection is the highest and the possibilities for higher 
output and profitable exports are the greatest, the EC is 
eliminating its barriers most slowly. This also applies to trade 
in farm commodities, for which the treaty generally does not 
envisage the establishment of a free-trade zone and which not 
only account for 20 percent of Poland's aggregate exports to the 
Community but also concern goods whose production cost is 
relatively low and that are, comparatively speaking, quite 
profitable. 
  A disturbing element is the increasingly frequent problems 
raised by the utilization of protective clauses by individual 
member countries of the Community attempting to protect 
themselves against higher imports from Poland. This concerns, in 
particular, the subsectors currently experiencing major 
structural problems, such as the steel industry and farming. 
Most often, Polish exporters are being accused of dumping, the 
more so considering that, often in this country, the domestic 
prices of some or other products are not treated as real market 
prices. Our farm exports are being restricted under various 
pretexts. 
  It appears, however, that the Commission of the Communities 
is aware of the rising protectionism and, in practice, low 
extent of the concessions granted in the association agreement. 
The Copenhagen Summit (21-22 June 1993) became yet another 
attempt to meet the expectations of the Central-East European 
countries. Five of the decisions adopted at that summit are 
especially noteworthy, as viewed from our standpoint: 
  --[Full] membership of the associated countries in the EC 
was 
defined as a common objective of both sides. 
  --A fuller incorporation of the associated countries in the 
institutional structures of the EC was envisaged. 
  --The liberalization of imports by the EC will be 
accelerated. 
  --Part of PHARE funds will be allocated for direct 
infrastructural investments. 
  --The possibility of including the associated countries in 
some Community programs will be afforded. 
  This appears to be laying a solid foundation for the growth 
of further cooperation; however, the reality may prove different 
from the Copenhagen declarations. The broadening of economic 
ties is being impeded by the deep crisis in the world economy. 
Unexpected problems may also arise owing to the transformations 
occurring within the EU itself.[.sup]1[/] 
<H8>  Effects of Changes in the Foreign Policy of the EU </H8>
  Poland's attempts to establish closer cooperation with (up 
to 
and including [full] membership in) the EU coincide with the 
marked advancement of the integration of West Europe (within the 
framework of the Union and between the Union and the EFTA 
[European Free Trade Association]). This markedly complicates 
achieving our goal because we have to adapt ourselves to an 
organism that is not only incomparably more highly developed but 
also rapidly evolving. The related nascent problems may be 
exemplified by two aspects of the Union's growth: a common 
foreign and security policy and a common trade policy. 
<H5>  Common Foreign and Security Policy </H5>
  Attempts to coordinate foreign policy have been under way 
since the EEC was first established. The Maastricht Treaty has 
brought considerable order into it, even if it also, as a result 
of far-reaching compromises, is couched in rather vague language 
open to diverse interpretations. Two major provisions of that 
treaty allow for the possibility of adopting decisions by a 
qualified majority of votes (Article J.3) and open the road for 
a common defense policy (Article J.4). Currently, the West 
European Union is charged with the responsibility for 
coordinating the defense system, though upon making allowances 
for the NATO obligations of certain of the Union's member 
countries. 
  To Central-East Europe, a more integrated Community with a 
common policy on a broader range of political and economic 
issues means primarily an organism that is more closed to third 
countries. A common foreign and security policy engenders two 
principal groups of barriers: 
  --Fear of domination by the larger and more highly developed 
countries of the Community; after 40 years of domination by 
Moscow, the countries of Central-East Europe are particularly 
sensitive about pursuing an independent foreign policy of their 
own. 
  --Lack of experience, and especially of discipline, in 
cooperating with other countries and coordinating foreign and 
security policy. As exemplified by the member countries of the 
EC themselves, even after 20 years of attempts to attain this 
kind of cooperation, that is no easy matter. 
  Neither Poland nor the other postsocialist countries can 
cope 
with these barriers. This process also requires involvement by 
the EC and a gradual preparation of eventual candidates for 
inclusion in all aspects of a common policy. A common foreign 
and security policy may prove a particularly valuable domain for 
gaining experience because here the form and scope and 
cooperation are defined only on the basis of a consensus of all 
of the member countries. 
<H5>  Foreign Economic Policy </H5>
  A point of departure for a common policy on foreign economic 
relations is the Treaty of Rome, which mentions, among the 
principal instruments of the EC, a common system of external 
tariffs and a common trade policy (Article 3). Along with the 
Uniform European Act, the EC extended coordination to other 
domains of economic cooperation. The Maastricht Treaty thus 
introduced no radical changes in this respect, merely confirming 
(Article 3) that the EC's activities include, among other 
things, a common trade policy and an internal market 
characterized by a free flow of goods, people, services, and 
capital. 
  The provisions of the Uniform Act, while pertaining 
exclusively to internal liberalization and formally not 
referring to foreign relations, are not irrelevant to the EC's 
partners. At least three aspects of the EC's new policy will be 
directly related to these provisions: 
  --Allocation of EC quotas: To be sure, the EC does not 
intend 
to extend national quotas to the entire territory of the 
Community; rather, it intends to eliminate these quotas by using 
various forms of compensation during the transition period. 
Nevertheless, this may initially result in tighter protectionism: 
  --Protective measures: Previously employed individually by 
the various countries pursuant to Article 115 of the Treaty of 
Rome, upon merely notifying the Commission; under the Maastricht 
Treaty, they will now be subject to total control by the 
Commission and contingent on its prior approval. 
  --Trade in goods not included in the rules of the Common 
Market: Under Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome, defense goods 
were excluded from free trade, and a detailed list of such 
merchandise was agreed upon in 1950 and, in connection with the 
creation of the Common Market, has to be not only updated but 
also downsized. 
  Unlike in the case of the EC's common foreign and security 
policy, any changes in its common economic policy will affect 
Poland's situation both when that country joins the Community 
and when it remains outside it. Of a certainty, the possibility 
of inclusion in an area covered by a common protection system is 
more favorable to producers, but, on the other hand, the 
discrepancies in the economic systems and development levels of 
the EC and Poland are so marked that opening the domestic market 
to competition may cause unimaginable damage to the enterprises 
that still operate according to the principles of a planned 
economy. The aforementioned extension of national quotas to the 
entire area of the EC and the restrictions on the employment of 
protective measures require a long preparatory period even in 
the case of the weaker members of the Community. Major problems 
may also arise in connection with such issues as: 
  --The requirements posed by the standards and technical 
norms 
of the EC. 
  --The still predominant share of the state-owned sector in 
manufacturing [in Poland]. 
  --Adaptations of the financial and tax system. 
  --Liberalization of the service sector. 
  These are only representative and most important groups of 
problems, but even they alone demonstrate the magnitude of the 
technological, organizational, and--most important--financial 
efforts that will have to be undertaken in the event that any of 
the countries of Central-East Europe join the EU. 
<H8>  Prospects and Challenges </H8>
  As can be seen, cooperation with the EU is not problem-free. 
What is more, as this cooperation grows, not only the problems 
but also its cost will increase. But this does not mean that 
Poland should abandon the ambition of becoming an associate and 
later full member of the Union because then the cost to this 
country would be still higher. But everything should be done in 
order to completely exploit the opportunities and possibilities 
being afforded by the new situation in Europe, and also to get 
prepared, through the joint effort of both sides, for eventual 
problems and to try and reduce them to a minimum 
  In the case of the member countries of the Communities, this 
requires chiefly overcoming the stereotyped idea of a conflict 
between "broadening" (accepting new members) and "deepening" ( 
developing new domains and forms of mutual cooperation). 
According to this stereotype, any tightening of ties between the 
Union and the Central-East European countries can be considered 
only after the process of building the Union is completed. Yet, 
opposing these two concepts in itself already is fallacious 
because they are not mutually exclusive and, even more, they 
cannot run their course independently of one another. Any change 
in EC policies, if it is to be lasting, should by now make 
allowance for the needs and possibilities of potential new 
members. This is particularly essential in the case of the 
countries of the former Soviet bloc, which in every respect 
remain separated from the EC by an abyss they cannot bridge on 
their own. 
  Besides, paying attention to Central-East Europe does not 
mean halting the development of the Communities. On the 
contrary, any attempt to "put on hold" the lagging part of the 
European Continent would be harmful to both sides. Thus, the 
"deepening" of the EC could be enriched by taking a number of 
specific measures enabling the countries of Central-East Europe 
to smoothly join that process and, by the same token, 
stabilizing and accelerating the reforms in these countries 
themselves. Such measures may consist in, e.g.: 
  --Speeding up the implementation of the provisions of 
association agreements (and, in particular, in this connection, 
accelerating the liberalization of access of East European goods 
to the EC market. 
  --Affording to the countries of Central-East Europe the 
possibility of participating, at least in the capacity of 
observers, in the shaping of Community regulations (so-called 
acquis communautaire). 
  --Including associated members of the EC completely in the 
domains of common policies, where this does not threaten the 
unity of the Communities (e.g., environmental protection, 
research programs, regional policy). 
  --Developing a concept of "gradual membership" that would 
enable the Central-East European countries to be gradually 
included in the formulation of common policies and, insofar as 
possible, to participate in their implementation. 
  There is no precedent for any of these concepts in the 
foreign relations of the EC so far, but the complexity of the 
situation and the overall process of restructuring the shape of 
the Communities require a new approach to the process of 
European integration as a whole. 
  Much more difficult (and definitely more important) is 
another aspect of this whole process--namely, the proper 
formulation and consistent implementation of a Polish strategy 
of development because, regardless of how good the conditions 
afforded us by the EU may be, it will be up to us to utilize 
them properly. This requires, above all, strategic thinking in 
global terms and, thereupon, the adaptation thereto of our 
current foreign and domestic policies. 
  Specific measures should be primarily taken to exploit the 
opportunities already afforded by the Interim Trade Agreement 
and especially by the three-year period of one-sided 
liberalization of trade specified in that agreement. In this 
case, the paramount requirement is an economic policy 
stimulating improvements in the efficiency of our domestic 
industry and a proexport orientation of production. A survey 
conducted by E. Kawecka-Wyrzykowska indicates that, to 90 
percent of the Polish enterprises that export their products 
and/or deal in exports, the principal barriers are of a domestic 
nature (debt, instability of tariff and tax regulations, 
excessively high cost of investment, etc.).[.sup]2[/] 
  In addition to a rational program encompassing the whole of 
domestic economic policy, a specific plan dealing directly with 
the implementation of the treaty and regulating our current 
contacts is also needed. The principal measures should include: 
  --Determining which institution is to be responsible for an 
efficient flow of information among interested organizations; 
this concerns information on the extent of the utilization of 
the export quotas assigned to us, on the possibilities for the 
legal protection of the domestic market and Polish producers 
against excessive competition from the Communities, and on the 
process of adaptation of the Polish legal system and the 
prospects for scientific and cultural exchange. 
  --Efficient monitoring of the consequences of the treaty, 
serving to formulate proper arguments and coordinate contacts 
with the Communities. These contacts do not have to be top-level 
alone because possibilities for tightening or renegotiating 
certain provisions are also afforded to the Association Council 
established under the agreement, and, similarly, the Joint 
Commission of the Polish parliament and the European Parliament 
can also act on its own initiative. 
  --Dissemination of the basic legal acts and documents 
crucial 
to cooperation with the EU at various levels, and popularization 
of knowledge about the Union among the public. 
  But the coordination of all measures remains the fundamental 
prerequisite. This means, on the one hand, coordination of the 
process of adapting our economy, legal system, social policy, 
etc. to the requirements posed by the European Treaty and, on 
the other, coordination of the measures taken to restructure the 
economy as a whole, in both its relations with the economies of 
other countries and in purely domestic terms.

<F P=106> [Article by R.W.: "Public Opinion Research Institute for </F>
RZECZPOSPOLITA; Important and More Important Elections"] 
  [Text] "From my point of view, the self-governmental and 
parliamentary elections are equally important"--this according 
to almost 40 percent of adult Poles, respondents to a poll 
conducted at the request of our daily by the Public Opinion 
Research Institute [PBS] in Sopot. Nearly 30 percent of 
respondents believe that the parliamentary elections are more 
important, and almost 20 percent that the self-governmental ones 
are. Generally, then, the parliamentary elections are evaluated 
as more important than the local elections. The poll was carried 
out a week before the election date. 
  Both kinds of elections are often compared. Public opinion 
researchers estimate that participation in the local elections 
may be lower than in the parliamentary elections. A lot is 
being said about the fact that the local elections have acquired 
a political character, which results, among other things, from 
the fact that they are being held just a few months after 
parliamentary elections; those elections were lost by 
postsolidarity and rightist groupings and won by parties with 
origins tracing back to the Polish People's Republic. Thus, it 
is another test of forces for both the winners and the losers. 
In many cases, the coming elections will also acquire the 
characteristics of a referendum for or against the 
self-governmental authorities that have been in power since 1990. 
  We evaluate the intentions of our fellow countrymen slightly 
differently from our own. According to 30 percent of the 
respondents to the PBS poll, for other people the parliamentary 
elections are more important; 14 percent say that the 
self-governmental elections are more important; 4 percent 
believe that neither set of elections is of any special 
significance; and, according to 24 percent, Poles attach equal 
importance to the self-governmental and parliamentary elections. 
Almost 30 percent of the respondents had difficulty evaluating 
the views of other people. 
  Representatives of groups that are higher in the social 
hierarchy (the management cadre, well-off and educated people) 
say relatively frequently that, for other people, more important 
are the parliamentary elections; however, they themselves 
usually say that both kinds of elections are equally important. 
Also, the view has been confirmed that the idea of 
self-government is more important for small communities. In 
rural areas and small towns, there are more people for whom the 
self-governmental elections are of greater importance than 
parliamentary elections. 
  The poll was carried out on 11 and 12 June on a 1,043-person 
representative sample of adult inhabitants of the country.

<F P=106> [Article by Marek Wielgo: "Reprivatization--Bone of </F>
Contention"] 
  [Text] There is probably no political party that 
would officially reject the idea of reprivatization. Still, 
this is the fourth government and the third parliament to be 
deliberating the issue. As usual, the problem of who to return 
property to and in what form is a bone of contention. 
  A draft reprivatization law coming from some Sejm deputies 
was submitted to the Sejm in December; it satisfies former 
owners but does not suit the government. Under the government's 
auspices, a counterproposal was prepared by the Ownership 
Transformations Ministry, but the former owners say it is 
unacceptable. 
  According to Deputy Ownership Transformations Minister 
Andrzej Zebrowski, the state cannot afford the kind of 
wide-sweeping reprivatization that is being suggested by the 
Sejm deputies. "Our assessment is that claims by former owners 
amount to about 350 trillion zlotys [Z]," Zebrowski says. "To 
meet the claims, companies subject to privatization must devote 
5 percent of their shares to this every year. That means that, 
this year, the former owners could expect Z400 billion worth of 
shares." 
  "But we want the property to be returned to us in its 
natural 
form," reply those harmed. "Only in cases where that would be 
impossible,could the state offer substitute property or 
securities. Then, reprivatization would not have a damaging 
effect on the state budget." 
  "To return property in its natural form? That would create 
conflicts," counters Deputy Minister Zebrowski. "Take the 
ill-fated Warsaw apartment houses, for instance. About 4,500 
former owners or heirs are seeking to have the houses returned 
to them. If we were to do that, the current residents of the 
houses would object." 
  So the government proposes reprivatization coupons [bony 
reprywatyzacyjne], with which one could buy real estate being 
sold by the State Treasury or by gminas [small administrative 
units]. But only those people whose property was seized 
illegally by the state in the 1944-58 period would receive the 
coupons. 
  This would decrease the amount of claims from Z350 trillion 
to Z150 trillion, but that is still too much. Those harmed 
would not receive as much as their real estate is worth--they 
would receive 63-percent less. 
  The former owners do not understand the need for the new law 
because they can seek judicial remedies even now. "The 
government wants to legalize the barbarian laws of the Polish 
People's Republic," they say. "But the decrees through which 
the state took the property away from the people were contrary 
to the constitutional order." 
  Those harmed do not want the coupons, which may turn out to 
be just a pile of worthless paper if gminas are not obliged to 
sell real estate to people holding the coupons. Their view is 
that the coupons will be a way to get rich for those who will 
buy them very cheaply, and then, through personal connections 
with the gmina authorities, they will be buying real estate with 
the coupons.

<F P=106> [Interview with Roman Czerwinski, under secretary of state </F>
in the Ministry of Industry and Trade, by Zbigniew Kozakiewicz; 
place and date not given: "Swords Into Plowshares"] 
  [Text] [Kozakiewicz] The arms industry has a highly skilled 
labor force and a great tradition, and its products are of good 
quality. Nevertheless, it is in trouble. 
  [Czerwinski] Let us begin by considering that, in the 
1980's, 
the concept "arms industry" extended to some 90 manufacturing 
plants, both final producers and supplier plants. These plants 
were geared to serving our military and the armies of the Warsaw 
Pact, and, in addition, we exported part of the output outside 
the Warsaw Pact. The changes in our region, the collapse of the 
Warsaw Pact, and the abandonment of the policy of confrontation 
and of materiel stockpiling led to a situation in which such a 
considerable potential of the arms industry has turned out to be 
unnecessary. Most of its manufacturing plants had to retool to 
other production. At present, our arms industry consists of 31 
plants, chiefly final producers. It is a modern industry, and 
its products do not deviate from international standards; its 
output can supply about 70 percent of weaponry and equipment for 
the military. 
  [Kozakiewicz] What kinds of weaponry can it manufacture? 
  [Czerwinski] To put it differently, except for medium- and 
long-range antiaircraft missiles, supersonic aircraft, and large 
deep-sea vessels displacing more than 2,000 tons, we can make 
the entire weaponry and equipment needed by the military. 
  [Kozakiewicz] That is an impressive capability, but what is 
the industry's financial situation? 
  [Czerwinski] Its basic problems are its huge debt and the 
absence of alternative civilian production. In peacetime, arms 
plants cannot--because it is unnecessary--exploit their entire 
arms-manufacturing capacity, even if they are able to export 
part of their output. Thus, in order to keep operating, they 
have to make goods for the civilian market. Well, civilian 
production is not the problem; the real problem is its expansion 
to an extent sufficient to offset the deficit due to the 
mothballing or only partial utilization of defense production 
lines--hence the need to restructure the plants. Our experience, 
as well as the experience of other countries, indicates that, if 
output for the military is not more than 30 percent of capacity, 
a plant can still perform in the black if the remaining 70 
percent is sold. 
  I mentioned the arms industry's debt; last year it amounted 
to 16 trillion zlotys [Z]. At present, this burden is much 
lighter. Debt-reduction agreements account for about Z7.7 
trillion and other forms of debt conversion for Z3 billion. The 
remaining obligations were rescheduled and will be repaid 
partially in cash and partially in the form of shares in 
civilian production. Government loan guarantees--I emphasize, 
loan guarantees and not subsidies--have been provided, totaling 
Z25 trillion for industry as a whole. The arms industry and its 
particular plant can, if they have tangible prospects, count on 
loans totaling Z1 trillion and perhaps even more. About Z1 
trillion has been allocated for funding inactive production 
capacities. Altogether, this is, relatively speaking, a 
substantial amount. Arms plants have caught their breath and can 
exploit new opportunities. 
  [Kozakiewicz] You mean opportunities for developing products 
attractive to the civilian market? 
  [Czerwinski] Not only that. Our analyses demonstrate that 
the 
Polish arms industry can meet the needs of the military 70 
percent. The world is not standing still; hence, we too must 
think in long-range terms, about new types of weaponry and 
equipment, the modernization of current equipment, and the 
utilization of electronics and other achievements of science and 
technology. The Ministry of National Defense and our industry 
are doing a great deal of work on the modernization of weaponry. 
We have also established interesting contacts with foreign 
companies--Swedish, French, American ones. Joint undertakings 
are being planned. An example of a modern Polish project may be 
the Grom missile. An example--of course, not the only one--of 
extremely promising cooperation with foreign companies may be 
the joint project of the Gdansk Unimor and the Swedish Ericsson 
for developing tactical communications based on digital 
processing and the encodement of information. 
  [Kozakiewicz] Some foreign newspapers have been advising us 
to introduce a far-reaching conversion of our arms industry. It 
may be that the motive is to get rid of competition, is not that 
so? 
  [Czerwinski] It is hardly conceivable for a country of 
Poland's size to have no arms industry of its own. I believe 
that this idea is not even worth considering. Our arms industry 
remains in our Polish hands, and we shall continue to improve 
our technologies, but we shall also be wide open to foreign 
cooperation. The arms market is uncertain, but, perhaps, owing 
to such cooperation, broader export opportunities will be 
afforded. At any rate, I do not believe our exports are to 
diminish. 
  [Kozakiewicz] What other factors will influence the process 
of reforming the arms industry and adapting it to the market 
economy? 
  [Czerwinski] This process still continues and, for the 
enterprises to perform truly efficiently, it must continue 
further. The next step will be to commercialize the plants by 
transforming them into Treasury companies; this precisely means 
the adaptation of enterprises to the requirements of the market 
economy and adherence to the commercial laws and cost-effective 
accounting on the microscale. Arms enterprises will not be 
transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ownership 
Transformations because their sale, partially or in their 
entirety, is not envisaged. But this does not preclude 
structural and ownership transformations in those enterprises 
that produce for the civilian market. We shall support the 
concept of employee stock ownership, and this should favorably 
affect the ties between the work forces and the enterprises. 
Groups of companies will be organized under the arms 
enterprises, with the object of spurring their civilian 
production. The debt of these enterprises could be converted to 
shares in their civilian departments. All of these changes are 
intended not only to spur economic revival but also to 
counteract unemployment, which has strongly affected arms 
enterprises. At the same time, I wish to emphasize that these 
changes will not extend to the enterprise departments geared to 
defense production. 
  For the arms industry, privatization is not a means in 
itself 
but a means of promoting and accelerating economic growth. This 
policy on privatization will continue to be pursued. At the same 
time, considering the special nature of the arms industry, we 
shall also guide ourselves by the principle that the State 
Treasury is to own at least 51 percent of stock--that is, a 
majority share--in every arms enterprise, and the stock will be 
the registered rather than the bearer kind. Given adherence to 
this principle, practically all forms of structural-ownership 
transformations can still be applied. 
  [Kozakiewicz] The arms industry at one time found itself in 
an extremely difficult situation that was traumatic to its work 
force. What has changed in that respect? 
  [Czerwinski] We should bear in mind that at those 90 plants 
that worked for the arms industry in the 1980's, the share of 
civilian production was small, so that when the demand for 
military production slumped, it entailed collapse, mass layoffs, 
unemployment. That is why we attach such great importance to 
restructuring these plants, to converting to civilian 
production. Here I wish to emphasize the great role of the 
Committee for Scientific Research, whose projects are making it 
possible to surmount the related difficulties. 
  The arms plants had tried to save themselves by exporting to 
the East. This caused them to contract considerable debts owing 
to the difficult situation of their Eastern partners. By now, 
the plants have regained one-half of the value of those exports, 
while the other half does not appear to be irretrievably lost. I 
have already mentioned negotiations intended to reduce our 
multitrillion debt. Definite symptoms of a stabilization of the 
job market are arising. Such plants as the Rzeszow WSK 
[Transportation Equipment Plant] and Wroclaw Hydral, which 
slashed their employment in the years 1991-92, are now 
increasing it; the employees laid off in those years are 
returning to their work stations. For next year, we envisage no 
employee discharges other than those owing to old-age 
retirement. The establishment of civilian companies under the 
arms plants will also favorably affect the job market and reduce 
unemployment. All of this warrants speaking of a gradual 
improvement, of bettering the situation at arms-industry plants. 
As time goes on, this will be more tangible to employees than it 
is at present. 
  I would like to emphasize one other thing: There has been a 
marked improvement in the political climate, which favors the 
arms industry and the development of production for domestic 
consumption and exports. Our undertakings are commensurate. On 
the basis of what was done last year, we are organizing in 
Kielce an educational and promotional exhibition. We expect 
that, like other measures, it will foster the development of 
cooperation with domestic and foreign companies, the expansion 
of exports, and the strengthening of our potential.

<F P=106> [Article by Artur Morka: "Better `Bad Credits'"] </F>
  [Text] According to research results coming from the 
Institute of Market Economy Research, so-called bad credits 
(ones that have not been repaid by customers) constitute a 
decreasingly significant problem for the seven biggest 
commercial banks. 
  By the end of this year, bad credits will constitute about 
23 
percent of the entire credit portfolio of commercial banks. In 
1996, the number of bad credits should go down to 7-8 percent, 
which corresponds with norms usually adopted by banks in highly 
developed countries. 
  Bad credits began to be a problem after 1989; that is when 
economic conditions changed. Many enterprises could not repay 
credits they had borrowed earlier because they had problems in 
selling their products. But until they have repaid old credits, 
they could not have borrowed new ones (which they needed to 
modernize the production process.) 
  Bad credits began to also haunt the banks themselves. Even 
though interest rates were rising on paper, bankers were 
perfectly aware that once a debtor goes bankrupt, the chances to 
recover the money will be very slim indeed. The only solution 
was to write off part of the old debts for those enterprises 
that have good future prospects. 
  In March 1993, a law on restructuring banks and enterprises 
became effective. The banks researched by the institute were 
provided special bonds, in return for which they had to 
restructure their credit portfolios within a year. 
  The Institute of Market Economy Research examined the credit 
situation at seven banks separated out of the National Bank of 
Poland: Bank Gdanski, Bank Zachodni, Powszechny Bank Kredytowy, 
Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Pomorski Bank Kredytowy, Bank 
Depozytowo-Kredytowy, and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy. 
  The conclusion is that banking reconciliation proceedings 
[postepowanie ugodowe] was the most frequently applied method of 
restructuring debts--it was applied in four-fifths of the cases. 
The banks tried to recover about 15 percent of the debts by 
using judicial conciliation proceedings, while, in the remaining 
cases, Civil Code agreements were used. 
<H5>  Conciliation Most Frequent </H5>
  According to Finance Ministry data, enterprises had 
initiated 
over 190 banking conciliation proceedings by 31 March, out of 
which 120 were completed. As much as 60 percent of the 
proceedings were entered into by the banks researched by the 
institute. The value of these conciliation agreements is 
estimated at about 8 trillion zlotys [Z]. 
  Banking conciliation proceedings covered primarily large 
enterprises that employed on average over 1,300 employees. The 
majority of the enterprises (72 percent) are state-owned or 
Treasury-owned joint-stock companies. 
  The largest number of conciliation proceedings were 
initiated 
in the light and the electromachine industries, primarily in the 
Jelenia Gora, Opole, Lodz, Wroclaw, and Walbrzych Voivodships. 
As one can see, a majority of these voivodships are regions 
facing the danger of structural unemployment in which the 
industry's situation is very difficult. 
  In 30 percent of the banking conciliation agreements, the 
principle of substituting financial claims with shares in the 
enterprises was applied. This means that banks will have a 
better way of controlling the remedying process [proces 
naprawczy]. 
<H5>  Bankruptcy or Sale </H5>
  In the case of 162 enterprises that have incurred debts with 
the banks researched by the institute, courts declared 
bankruptcies of the enterprises on motions by the banks. This 
is the way the banks dealt with debtors who were without 
prospects for repaying the loans. In most cases, these were 
state-owned enterprises of the light or electromachine 
industries. No bankruptcy was declared with regard to 
enterprises of the fuel/energy or metallurgic industries. 
  Selling the financial claims [wierzytelnosci] of banks was 
another method of getting rid of the claims by the banks. The 
banks decided to put financial claims of 378 economic units up 
for sale; the total of the debts of these units amounted to 
about Z2.4 trillion. The prices ranged from 8 to 50 percent of 
the total value of a financial claim. Claims with regard to 
enterprises of the electromachine industry were the easiest to 
sell.

Switzerland. 
  [Correspondent] Heading a government delegation, Prime 
Minister Aleksander Meksi left for Switzerland today to attend 
the Crans Montana forum proceedings. High-level officials from 
various countries of the world have been invited to this 
meeting. The Crans Montana forum representatives organize 
roundtable talks to discuss situations and prospects of the 
development of world cooperation. 
  Before departure, Mr. Meksi made this statement for the 
television: 
  [Begin Meksi recording] Our delegation that will participate 
in the annual meeting of the Crans Montana Forum aims to present 
the Albanian reform with its results and difficulties, the 
institutional changes carried out in Albania, their perspective 
and future goals. It also intends to profit from the experiences 
of other countries that entered into reform before us or at the 
same time as us. As is known, this annual meeting of the forum 
will be attended by delegations from all former-communist 
Eastern European countries, as well as countries from Central 
Europe and international structures. That is, we will have an 
exchange of experiences and opinions, as well as contacts that 
will benefit Albanian foreign policy and be in the interests of 
Albania's economic development. 
  I think that these meetings are useful. Our delegation will 
try to truly present the political, economic, and institutional 
reforms in Albania, with all their benefits and difficulties.

<F P=106> [Article by Shemsedin Memia: "Ryerson's Paradox Illustrated </F>
in Own Words"] 
  [Text] The last U.S. diplomat left Albania in 1939 to 
return again after a lapse of nearly four decades. Embassies 
are now reopening and diplomats are knocking at the door.... 
William Ryerson is totally committed to his job, and expresses 
satisfaction with what he has done in the past two years. What 
our people were looking forward to, and what they expected from 
him, was U.S. investment in Albania. He sidesteps this issue, 
however, saying that "investments are expected to come only from 
private U.S. companies," and that "the delay is a result of the 
hurdles placed in the path of the Property Law." This law, 
however, has already been 90 percent implemented by our 
government. Is this simply a slip of the tongue, or it is his 
suspicions that prompt him to say this? Is this the truth, or 
it is just false information from the Albanian media? 
  Further, he adds that "one other decisive factor for the 
involvement of U.S. companies in Albania is the restoral of 
peace in Bosnia." Thus, there is a pretty long list of excuses 
to justify the failure to keep past promises. What are the 
arguments? Are they mere exercises in face-saving? Ryerson 
himself brought to Albania a lot of warships, and the chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides that are so badly needed by our poor 
agriculture. That is why the Albanians "appreciated" Ryerson's 
presence at the ceremony to commemorate the first anniversary of 
our policymakers' coming to power and at several award 
ceremonies, even various pioneers' events. In order simply to 
get rid of Fatos Nano, who used to irritate Mr. Ryerson, they 
found a pretext to imprison him. From now on, I believe Mr. 
Ryerson will be left in peace to address his compliments to his 
excellency the president and describe him as "the man who is 
sacrificing himself for the sake of Albania." In addition, Mr. 
Ryerson expresses joy over Albania's stability, freedom of 
speech, and freedom of the press! Dictatorship, he says, does 
not exist any more! 
  One can understand the reluctance of U.S. investors who, 
before coming to Albania, have to consult with Mr. Ryerson, or 
who are still waiting for the wars to end (God forbid that the 
warnings that the wars have only just begun should come true), 
but why do people from the Albanian diaspora in the United 
States and other countries not come to Albania? Are they scared 
by the "sweet" words of Mr. Ryerson, the U.S. plenipotentiary in 
Albania? It seems that U.S. and other foreign investors do not 
like tranquility and stability, or else they are astute enough 
to realize that there is some truth behind the diplomat's words.

<F P=106> [Part I of "Summary of the Program of the Right-Wing </F>
Democratic Party of Albania"] 
  [Text] The Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania (PDDSH) 
is a political force which aims at coalescing around itself all 
honest Albanians who are against communism, fascism, or any 
other form of totalitarian ideology. The PDDSH struggles for a 
free and democratic Albania where full freedom of the 
individual, private property, religion, thinking, expression, 
and action should be guaranteed in a lawful and democratic state. 
<H5>  The Political Position of the PDDSH </H5>
  1. The PDDSH is a political force on the right wing of the 
Albanian political spectrum, relying on and defending the rights 
of all those who are in favor of a firm anticommunist stand. It 
primarily relies on the broad masses of former political 
prisoners and detainees, former owners stripped of their 
property by the communist dictatorship, the broad masses of 
workers, both employed or economically assisted by the state, 
honest intellectuals, the youth of Albania, suffering women of 
Albania, and the Albanian patriotic peasantry. 
  2. The PDDSH will cooperate with other political right wing 
forces for the creation of a common anticommunist front. 
  3. The PDDSH will not accept any agreement with forces of 
neo- communist and communist convictions and stands. 
  4. The PDDSH will turn down any political agreement with 
extremist forces that aspire to resort to violence. 
  5. The PDDSH will work to attract the rank and file PD 
[Democratic Party] members who nurture right-wing democratic 
aspirations. The PDDSH will not enter into any relationship with 
the present PD leadership, because it thinks that they hold 
neocommunist views and positions. 
  6. The PDDSH will carry out its political activities in a 
democratic way, rigorously respecting the constitutional order 
and laws of the state. 
  7. The PDDSH is a party of clear nationalist stance. It will 
strive to protect Albania's freedom, independence, and national 
interests. The PDDSH is for an ethnic Albania, created through 
the free expression of our people's will in the motherland and 
the will of our brothers living in their own territories in 
Montenegro, Sandjak, Kosova, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], as well as the will of the 
expropriated Cams, who were expelled from their legitimate lands 
in Greece. Working for the realization of these aspirations, the 
PDDSH declares itself against any violent changes of the 
existing state borders of Albania with its neighboring countries. 
  8. The PDDSH will resolutely fight for the thorough 
eradication of communism and neocommunism in Albania. In this 
respect, it will also work for: 
  - the creation of a state commission which should 
investigate 
and bring to account the former ruling communists who have 
perpetrated political genocide against the people or have their 
hands stained with the blood of innocent people. 
  - the weeding out of former communists from responsible 
positions and decisionmaking bodies of the state administration. 
  - the investigation of business activities of unscrupulous 
speculators who have illicitly become rich and against whom 
measures should be taken, including expropriation in accordance 
with the law. 
  9. The PDDSH is for guaranteeing the rights of national 
minorities living in Albania, strictly honoring relevant 
international agreements. 
  10. The PDDSH will work for the state to protect the 
legitimate rights of our fellow countrymen who are permanently 
or temporarily living in other countries. The PDDSH will strive 
to mobilize our compatriots, however they live, in our country's 
political, cultural, and economic life. 
<H5>  The PDDSH's Economic Program </H5>
  1. The PDDSH is for a market economy, but economic reform in 
Albania should take into consideration our country's specific 
political, social, and economic conditions created following the 
collapse of the cruel communist dictatorship. The PDDSH is 
against the "shock therapy" and in favor of a gradual reform 
resulting in less drastic consequences during the transition 
period. 
  2. The PDDSH will work to reduce the unemployment level by 
taking the following main measures: 
  a. Putting under operation state-owned profitable 
enterprises 
mainly in food, textiles, mining industry, and in agriculture, 
etc. 
  b. Investing in projects that create more new jobs in 
infrastructure, forestry, tourism, and so forth. 
  c. Encouraging private business of productive character, 
which involves more manpower. 
  d. Rapid privatization at all levels of state-owned 
enterprises. 
  3. The PDDSH will strive to narrow at fast speed the 
existing 
differences between the real pay and price level, in the 
following aspects: 
  a. Control, through a discouraging fiscal system, over the 
uncontrollable price hikes. 
  b. Gradual increase of salaries, pensions, and assistance 
allowances. 
  c. Tax exemption of pensioners, unemployed people receiving 
economic assistance, invalids, and children, and ticket price 
reduction for them in state-owned transport, cultural and sports 
activities, public services, electrical energy, dental services, 
school texts, and so on. 
  4. The PDDSH will work to draft a state financial budget on 
a 
more studied basis, bearing in mind the following: 
  -- More rational rapports between investment and 
assistance, giving priority to the former so as to enable work 
and production to start again from scratch. 
  -- Drastic cuts in unproductive costs, particularly in 
state administration, army, and so on. 
  5. The PDDSH will struggle in a lawful way to abrogate 
immediately the Law No. 7,689 of 15 April 1993 "On the 
Restitution and Compensation of Buildings and Lands," and No. 
7501 of 10 July 1993 "On the Agricultural Land." It will strive 
for new laws to be passed that should thoroughly honor the 
legitimate rights of former owners in towns and countryside to 
total and unconditional restitution of their property, 
arbitrarily grabbed by the communist state and not given back 
even by the present laws in force. The PDDSH will strive that 
the new laws on property contain the following legal obligations 
to the owners: 
  a. Immediate and unconditional restitution of the existing 
buildings. 
  b. Immediate restitution of free land grounds, or those on 
which economic or cultural facilities and villa type dwellings 
have been built. 
  c. Compensation in value, in other land grounds or in 
buildings (according to the former owner's right to choose) for 
all the land grounds occupied by multistory dwellings (apartment 
flats). 
  d. Compensation in value, or in other land grounds, for 
occupied land grounds on which social facilities have been 
built, like hospitals, schools, kindergartens and nurseries, 
roads, parks, stadiums, and sport fields. 
  e. Full restitution of agricultural lands, olive trees, 
grazing lands and forests to poor, middle or rich former owners 
living in towns or in the countryside. 
  f. In areas where the state possesses large areas of land, 
the former landowners can be compensated, if they so wish, in 
plots of land from the state-owned land. 
  g. Peasants, who according to "the Land Law" have received 
plots of land, remain as tenants of this land now belonging to 
its former owner. The owner cannot send the tenant away from 
this land earlier than a period of five years. After this 
period, new contractual agreements can be concluded between the 
owner of the land and the tenant. 
  In this case, the tenants who have rented the land do not 
pay 
any more taxes to the state. 
  6. The PDDSH will fight for the abrogation of the existing 
laws on privatization, because they sanction the privileges of 
red businessmen and violate the rights of former owners, 
political detainees, and the working people. The PDDSH will 
strive for a minute revision of privatization, according to the 
following criteria: 
  a. Small and medium-size enterprises should be privatized by 
selling them on credit to former owners of objects, land 
grounds, former political detainees, and people working in them. 
The credit will be paid back within a delayed period of five to 
10 years, without any bank interest rate. 
  b. Large enterprises will be converted into shareholder 
enterprises in which 51 percent of the shares will initially 
remain state-owned property and 49 percent will be given free of 
charge to the workers of the respective enterprises. 
  c. With the abrogation of the government decision which has 
divided land to the working people for use, the agricultural 
enterprises will be revived and converted into shareholder 
enterprises, where shares will be divided according to the "b" 
clause of this article. 
  d. In agricultural enterprises set up on land that was 
formerly private property, the land, together with the economic 
projects built on it, will be given back to the former owner of 
the land, who is obliged to offer employment to not less than 
one farmer per family, for a period of two to three years. These 
types of enterprises can also be turned into private shareholder 
enterprises by agreement with the owner or owners who are 
carrying out their economic activities in the territory of 
former state enterprises. 
  7. The PDDSH is for the restitution to the former owners of 
riches expropriated or confiscated without compensation by the 
communist state, such as toppled buildings, livestock, monetary 
values, and so on. This will be gradually realised within a 
period of several years. 
  8. The state should compensate the political prisoners and 
detainees of the communist regime according to their relevant 
status in the following main directions: 
  a. Compensation in cash for the period of their sentence 
term 
in jails or concentration camps. 
  b. Free of charge privatization of state-houses they are 
living in. 
  c. Providing homeless people with free housing by the state. 
  d. Credits without bank interest rate, enabling them to 
start 
up business, and priority to the privatization of economic 
enterprises. Priority to employment. 
  e. Awarding study scholarships at home and abroad. 
  9. The PDDSH will encourage foreign investment in Albania. 
The PDDSH is of the opinion that the restitution of property to 
its former owners will attract foreign investors. The PDDSH is 
for offering stimulus to investment by large and serious foreign 
companies and creating procedural facilities for the conclusion 
of relevant contracts. A state administrative body will be set 
up for this purpose. It will deal with all the necessary 
practices that are currently dispersed among many government 
bodies, causing undue delays and concern to the foreign 
investors, and leaving room for corruption. 
  The PDDSH is of the opinion that in certain important 
sectors 
of our economy like agriculture, tourism, mining, and forestry, 
a policy of concessions must be pursued as a most profitable 
policy in our conditions, which would further encourage foreign 
and serious investors. Priority in these concessions will be 
given to agreements between governments. 
  10. The PDDSH will work to attract most favorable credits to 
our country. Work will be done for more acceptable rapports 
between investment funds and those for technical assistance. 
  11. The PDDSH will see that the credits received by the 
Albanian banks really serve to encourage productive activities. 
In this respect, the following basic criteria will be pursued: 
  -- To lower bank interest rates to medium international 
levels. 
  -- To create favorable conditions (longer terms with lower 
interest rate) for productive activities which create new jobs 
in agriculture, construction, public services, etc. 
  12. The PDDSH will strive, through a favoring fiscal policy 
and state investments, to support and encourage the activities 
of those enterprises that produce domestic goods, especially in 
food, tobacco, the textile industry, etc. 
  13. The PDDSH is for the immediate creation of a stock 
exchange market. It is of the opinion that the setting up of 
private shareholder companies will mark a consolidating step for 
the market economy in Albania. 
<H5>  The PDDSH's Agrarian Policy </H5>
  The PDDSH considers agriculture as one of the main branches 
of our economy, which plays and will still play in the future a 
primary role in our country's economic development. In this 
respect, the PDDSH will work to create conditions for Albanian 
agriculture and the Albanian countryside to embark really and as 
soon as possible upon a modern and intensive level of 
development, capable of successfully competing in the 
international market. To achieve this goal, the PDDSH will work 
in the following directions: 
  1. The production structures of the private agricultural 
economies should be defined by their owners themselves, 
according to the requirements of the market. The prospective 
development of agriculture will be guided by the state along a 
policy of subsidies. Given its suitable climatic and soil 
conditions, Albanian agriculture will be oriented toward the 
cultivation of tobacco, vineyards, cultivation of vegetables, 
strawberries and flowers in greenhouses, and toward animal 
husbandry. 
  2. Given the difficulties in creating a modern and 
competitive agricultural technology due to the large 
fragmentation of the land, the PDDSH will work (by providing 
credits, subsidies, and a favorable fiscal system) for the 
creation of farmers' units and private shareholder enterprises 
in the production sphere, agricultural machinery, transport, 
collecting and trading the products, and in the bank system, etc. 
  3. The PDDSH will work to encourage and stimulate the 
setting 
up of private farms by specialists in agriculture, the state 
renting them land from its own land (10-12 hectares) and 
offering them assistance with credits at low interest rates, 
exempting them from rent tax, and reducing their income tax for 
the first two or three years, etc. 
  4. The state, through a license system, will encourage the 
creation of private rural centers for selling seeds, pesticides, 
and chemical fertilizers. These centers will be required to be 
run by agronomists of high education. 
  5. The PDDSH will insist that a network of centers of 
technical assistance and control over agriculture be organized 
on a village- commune basis so as to ensure effective assistance 
and control over the development of agriculture and animal 
husbandry, according to technical discipline, strictly 
respecting the legislation in force. 
  6. The PDDSH is for offering support to joint ventures with 
foreign investment, by respecting parity in invested capitals 
and clearly defining the mutual obligations and profits in 
advance. 
  The state will also assist in creating enterprises with 
foreign investors, renting to them land from the state-owned 
land, and allowing private owners, too, to rent their land. 
  7. While being for passing a law that will allow selling and 
buying land, the PDDSH is against selling agricultural land to 
foreigners for a period of not less than 10 years, and it is 
against selling agricultural land to citizens of neighboring 
countries who live near the frontiers with our country. 
  The PDDSH will pursue a social policy promoting the 
interests 
of the most deprived and unprotected segments of our country's 
population. It will strive to protect the interests of these 
segments, making the state take the necessary measures in their 
favor. The PDDSH will struggle also for improvements in the 
social policy pursued by the state in all fields of its 
activities. In this respect, the PDDSH's attention will focus on 
taking the following measures: 
  1. Free ambulatory and hospital health services in the 
state-owned health institutions. Free service in the state-owned 
dental clinics (except for full or partial prostheses, for which 
pensioners, invalids, and people economically assisted by the 
state will pay up to a 50-percent reduced price. 
  2. State-owned education system. Obligatory eight-year 
education. Reduced prices of school books. 
  3. The state will support scientific research work in all 
fields. The scientific research institutions will be entirely 
financed by the state. 
  4. The state will fully or partially finance the activities 
of cultural and sports institutions, as well as educational 
entertainment and leisure activities for youth and children. The 
state will also assist and encourage private undertakings in 
setting up and operating sports associations, establishments for 
the education and entertainment of children (discos, cinemas and 
clubs, game centers, swimming pools, etc.) The state will assist 
with financial contribution in setting up clubs and other 
establishments for aged people and pensioners. 
  5. The PDDSH will strive to extend the period of leave days 
per year, birth leave days for pregnant women, and prohibit 
night shift work or other particularly difficult jobs for women. 
  7. The PDDSH will strive for the improvement of 
infrastructure by investing in repairing existing roads and 
building up a new modern road, railroad, and internal air 
transport network. 
  8. The PDDSH will persevere with investments in 
restructuring 
the electrical network of the cities and their potable water 
supply system. 
  9. The PDDSH attaches extremely great importance to a 
concrete estimation of Albania's intellectual potential. The 
PDDSH will struggle so that the state pursues a favorable policy 
toward an active participation of Albanian intellectuals and 
specialists in drafting projects, steering and putting them into 
practice, and in other technical and scientific undertakings, 
keeping under control the number of foreign specialists involved 
in these projects. The PDDSH severely condemns as antinational 
and antieconomic every attitude of underestimating our 
specialists. 
  10. The PDDSH is of the opinion that the state should 
coordinate private business through legal means, ensuring fair 
rapports between the sphere of commerce and that of public 
service so as normally to meet the population's needs in this 
sector. 
  11. The state will wield its strict control over hygiene and 
sanitary conditions in the commercial sector and services. It 
will gradually restrict street vendor trade, especially in food 
products, and discipline the trade of vegetables and fruits in 
centers controlled by hygiene and sanitary bodies. 
  12. The PDDSH is for a fair solution and prevention of 
social 
conflicts stemming from demographic movements of the population 
from mountainous areas, especially from the northeastern parts 
of our country. The PDDSH will not encourage parallel movements 
from one village to another, but it is for a free movement of 
people from villages to the towns. In the actual period of 
trnasition, the PDDSH is of the opinion that the state, through 
investments in forests and mines, should assist the peasants 
living in these areas with long-term, interest-free credits, so 
as to create living conditions in their areas until jobs for 
them are created in the towns. 
  The PDDSH views the movement of part of the population into 
the towns as an indispensable element of the long-term state 
program. In this respect, the state will give priority to 
villagers having little land, and families living in 
agricultural state-owned enterprises to move gradually to the 
towns as new jobs are created there. 
  13. In all its political activity, especially dealing with 
economic and social problems, the PDDSH will seek the opinion of 
and closely cooperate with the BSPSH [Union of Independent Trade 
Unions of Albania], the Association of Former Political 
Prisoners and Detainees, the Association of the Kulaks, 
patriotic societies like "Kosova," "Cameria," "Tirana," and 
other societies of anticommunist program and orientation. (To be 
continued in the next issue.)

  [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] and SZDSZ 
[Alliance of Free Democrats] have agreed that under the 
coalition government there will be 12 ministries. The 
ministerial posts and the posts of political and administrative 
state secretaries will be filled on a professional basis. Judit 
Laszlo reports on the governmental committee session. 
  [Laszlo] The two parties do not wish to amend the 
Constitution in order to transform the government, but the law 
on ministries will require correction, said Imre Szekeres, the 
committee's Socialist cochairman, at the end of the discussions. 
  He added: The work of the new government will require 12 
portfolios. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and the 
Ministry of International Economic Relations will be amalgamated. 
  The new government will have to decide which organizations 
of 
national jurisdiction it will want. Until then they will come 
under ministerial supervision, said Imre Szekeres, who spoke 
about other decisions as well: 
  [Begin Szekeres recording] We agreed that the internal 
structure of the ministries will not change; that is the 1990 
decision, namely the separation of the political and 
professional tasks, will remain in force. In other words, 
political state secretaries will remain, whose first tasks will 
be deputizing for the minister and a liaison role with 
parliament. 
  For the time being we have left it in the balance whether to 
change the name. There are two possible standpoints; I think 
that there is no dispute between us on this point; both are 
acceptable. What we must look at is which one represents less of 
a change, a change either of a legal or financial nature, if we 
alter the name. 
  We have agreed not to alter the ministries' internal 
structure insofar as the professional work will be coordinated 
by an administrative state secretary, one administrative state 
secretary. However, we will propose that the number of deputy 
state secretaries should be determined in accordance with the 
tasks and not according to a general rule. In other words, that 
there should not be five deputy state secretaries everywhere 
where that number is not actually needed. [end recording] 
  [Laszlo] The two parties are agreed that the majority of the 
minister without portfolio posts are not needed. There is a 
debate about the post of minister without portfolio in charge of 
national security. This topic will come before the plenary 
coalition session on Friday [17 June], as will the tasks of the 
various ministries, said Gabor Kuncze, the committee's SZDSZ 
cochairman. 
  The politicians were agreed that one and the same party 
should provide the minister and the political state secretary 
for a given portfolio, but that one or two exceptions are 
possible. To this Imre Szekeres added: The important thing is 
that both the minister and the political state secretary should 
be experts, and if one of the parties can recommend a more 
qualified candidate, it is conceivable that in exceptional cases 
the minister and the political state secretary would belong to 
different parties. 
  In answer to a question, Imre Szekeres said: If nominated, 
he 
would accept the post of SZDSZ parliamentary group leader.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with two unidentified officials of </F>
the National Security Office; place and date not given: "Who 
Sent the Terrorists to Parliament?"] 
  [Text] The police and the National Security Office [NSO] 
are working with their entire apparatus to investigate the 
bombing at the Parliament building. The two organizations are 
cooperating closely. We interviewed two high-ranking officials 
of the National Security Office, who do not wish their names to 
be revealed. They asked for our understanding because, in the 
course of investigating such affairs, there are always moments 
that cannot be made public. We first asked them to deal with 
the speculation here and abroad. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Is it possible that an international 
terrorist organization is behind this bombing at the parliament? 
  [Official] Like other versions, this is not impossible. 
However, these organizations generally declare themselves after 
the event or immediately beforehand. In other words, they 
"claim responsibility." No such signal has arrived in this case. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Do you consider it possible that a domestic 
extremist organization is behind it? 
  [Official] One cannot exclude this possibility, but there is 
no tradition of such a thing in Hungary. The fact that 
Parliament is also the symbol of our national past and history 
speaks against this possibility. Most known extremist 
organizations we can think of in this respect stress their 
national roots, and this does not seem to be compatible with an 
action against this historical site of our statehood. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] There are autonomous forces operating beyond 
our southern borders, forces that are not under state control. 
Threats against Hungarians in Vojvodina have also been mentioned 
in the press. There are rumors about the possibility of such 
organizations extending their operations beyond their own 
borders. Could all this be connected with the explosion? 
  [Official] I do not know your sources of information. 
Consequently, I do not want to comment at all on what you have 
just said. I repeat: We will investigate every possibility. 
We will not leave out any possibility. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Including the possibility that this action 
could somehow be connected with Magda Marinko's affair? 
  [Official] I am sorry that I have to repeat: We will not 
leave out any possibility. Not even such a possibility. Nor 
the possibility that a "lone wolf" or a crazy man carried out 
the bombing. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] You saw the location. What would you add to 
the descriptions that appeared in the press? 
  [Official] The fact that the front of Gate No. 19 was 
protected by a fence; at the same time, this is a building area. 
The attacker had to get over the fence, but this was probably 
not difficult because there were holes in the fence. A man of 
average physical condition could reach the gate from the Danube, 
place the bomb, and disappear in 3-4 minutes. If we take into 
account the approximately 6 minutes between two appearances of 
the guard in this area, the bomber had enough time. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, a single person could have 
done it. 
  [Unnamed official] It is not impossible. It is another 
matter that, in such cases, there is preliminary surveillance of 
the guards' movements and the placement of the television 
cameras, and there could be accomplices to choose the location 
and provide accommodation. However, with exact knowledge of the 
specifics of the location, a single person and 3-4 minutes would 
be enough. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Is the bomb found at Parliament a "relative" 
of the one in Szeged? 
  [Official] Yes, but I would entrust my colleagues with the 
details. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] You have been on location since early 
morning. What did you do? 
  [Official] We cooperated closely with the police bomb 
disposal experts. We collected everything that remained from 
the explosive device. Everything goes to the lab. It is 
tedious work, but it is worth it. The location and what remains 
there tell a lot even about the most sophisticated bomb. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] What did you find? 
  [Official] We found many pieces of a green-colored plastic, 
presumably pieces of a soap-holder-type box which held the 
alarm-watch-type timing device. There must have been somewhat 
less than one kilogram of TNT in the bomb. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] Is this a lot or little? What if this amount 
explodes on or in a car for example? 
  [Official] It is a strong bomb that would kill all the 
passengers and destroy the car completely. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] How big could this bomb be? 
  [Official] Altogether not bigger than 20x15 cm. It could 
comfortably be placed in a shopping bag. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] In what range can the timing device be set? 
Could you reconstruct the bomb? 
  [Official] The explosion can be set from 15 minutes to 26 
hours. Theoretically, it can also be set for a shorter time 
than 15 minutes, but if the time span is too short, it could 
also endanger the terrorist himself. Of course, we cannot say 
when the device was set before the explosion. Not only can we 
reconstruct the bomb but, thanks to what the bomb disposal 
experts have collected, we can see the exact model. Everything 
on this model is identical with this bomb before it went off. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] In connection with the bomb in Szeged, your 
colleague said only that it was a "relative" of the bomb that 
exploded at the Parliament. 
  [Official] If I may use the term here, I would say it was 
its little brother. We tested its power by analyzing the 
deformations on the pillar. The result: We are talking here 
about the same device, the same mechanical timing device, the 
same bomb, only with half the amount of explosive material. 
  [NEPSZABADSAG] In other words, it could be the same 
perpetrator. Is it possible that he is preparing for a third 
attack? 
  [Official] We cannot answer this question. Together with 
our police colleagues, we are working to discover and arrest the 
perpetrator or perpetrators....

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Deteriorating Foreign Trade Balance"] </F>
  [Text] The foreign trade balance continued to deteriorate 
in the first three months of the year: While exports increased 
by 25 percent, imports exceeded the level registered in the 
first quarter of 1993 by 30 percent, the Central Statistical 
Office [KSH] reported. 
  The decline of exports was the most visible characteristic 
of 
foreign trade in 1993 which resulted in a spectacular 
deterioration of the trade balance. In 1993, exports were 13 
percent lower than a year before. The reduction was typical 
mainly in the sales to market economy countries. Within this, 
Hungarian exports to the countries of the European Union (EU) 
decreased by 18 percent. 
  In 1993, the amount of imported goods increased by almost 21 
percent. Of this, 12 percent more goods arrived from the market 
economies and 49 percent more from transforming [atalakulo] 
countries. The latter was mainly in connection with on-off 
deliveries like MiG airplanes or the repair of Lithuanian 
airplanes. As a result, the import of machinery and transport 
vehicles from these countries increased almost sevenfold. 
  The volume of imports exceeded the previous year in all main 
product groups. In addition to significantly increased machinery 
import, the import of consumer industrial goods from the 
transforming countries and foodstuffs from the market economies 
increased the most, by 66 and 18 percent respectively. 
  The KSH detected further deterioration in the first quarter 
of 1994. While exports calculated at current prices increased 
by 25 percent, imports exceeded the level of the same period 
last year by 30.8 percent. A little over half of the balance 
deterioration arose in trade with the market economies, mainly 
with EU member states.

<F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "Temporary Nuclear Burial Site at </F>
Paks"] 
  [Text] An agreement has been reached between the Paks 
Nuclear Power Station Rt. and the Paks local government on the 
site for temporary storage of burnt-out heating elements. On 15 
June, a news conference was held at Paks Town Hall on the 
results of the public opinion poll preceding the decision and 
the conditions of the agreement. 
  As we have already reported, the construction of a storage 
place was made necessary by the fact that Russia accepted the 
heating elements in the past and is now showing reluctance to 
accepting further deliveries of radiating waste. 
  Mayor Imre Bor said that the local government wanted to 
represent the population's interests all along; this is the 
reason they carried out a public opinion poll before making the 
final decision. This demonstrated that, with adequate 
guarantees, 56 percent of the town's population accept the 
construction of the storage place; only 39 percent oppose it. 
This removed the last obstacle to reaching an agreement between 
the power station and the local government. 
  In addition to the guarantees, the agreement also provides 
130 million forints to the local government which can, among 
other things, be used for individual electric power allowances, 
based on need. The storage facility will be built in the 
vicinity of the power station.

  [Text] Negotiations between the republic of Serbian 
Krajina and the Republic of Croatia, which were supposed to 
convene today in Plitvice, have been called off. As was 
announced, the two sides were to talk exclusively about economic 
issues. Here is Branislav Bozic reporting from Plitvice: 
  I cannot tell you why the negotiations have been called off. 
They called me on the phone from Zagreb at 1345 and I was told 
that the negotiations had been called off since an agreement had 
not been reached on the details of the negotiations. I was also 
told to withdraw my people, and this is exactly what I am doing 
at the moment. This is what Colonel Bill Morton, a Canadian who 
is deputy commander of the South Sector in charge of organizing 
the conference, told us half an hour ago. 
  After that, we contacted Milan Martic, president of the 
republic of Serbian Krajina, and he told us that the Croatian 
side has set forth new ultimatums and is still conditioning the 
negotiations on bringing five of their correspondents and all 
U.S. correspondents who are in Zagreb, although a reciprocal 
decision was agreed upon during the preparations to the effect 
that only one of their correspondents and one cameraman can 
come, as was the case during the Zagreb talks, when only one 
correspondent and one television cameraman from the republic of 
Serbian Krajina were there, Martic said. 
  These negotiations obviously do not suit the Croatian side 
and they clearly want to not only postpone but interrupt them 
and accuse us in order to be able to carry out the war option. 
It is known that they are amassing forces along the borders of 
the republic of Serbian Krajina.

  [Text] Knin, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- The government of the 
republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] has done all it can over the past 
couple of days to continue the negotiating process with the 
Republic of Croatia on principles of equality and respect for 
the sovereignty and interests of the RSK, RSK Foreign Minister 
Milan Babic said in Knin today. 
  We did not make the continuation of the talks conditional on 
anything, but Croatia yesterday began its blockade of the 
negotiating process in a bizarre way--with a banal demand to 
allow five Croatian reporters to attend and cover the Plitvice 
talks. By substituting form for substance, they set this as the 
condition for the resumption of the talks. They managed to 
block the negotiations, as they had decided beforehand. They 
even proposed a final text of the agreement they wished us to 
sign in Plitvice, the ISKRA news agency quoted the Krajina 
foreign minister as saying. 
  We expect international factors to do all in their power so 
the peace process with Croatia could resume with the aim of 
achieving a lasting peace, which is in the interest of the Serb 
people and other members of the international community, Babic 
said while commenting on the postponement of the talks with 
Croatia.

  [Text] The talks on economic issues between the Croatian 
authorities and representatives of Serbs from the UNPA [UN 
Protected Area] -- which were scheduled to take place today -- 
have been canceled. Local Serbs refused to attend a meeting on 
the previously agreed terms. The most controversial questions 
concerned the agenda and issues in connection with delegations 
and the presence of Croatian journalists. Hrvoje Sarinic, the 
head of the Croatian delegation to talks with the Serbs, 
explains why the discussions were canceled. 
  [Begin Sarinic recording] The Serbs gave as a pretext our 
request that you, the media, should be present. My stand was 
very firm. I said that if the media are not present then the 
Croatian delegation will not come to the talks either. I think 
that the presence of the media is an indication of civilized 
behavior -- I would even say a question of general culture -- 
pardon me if I speak sharply -- and of decency. Why do I say 
decency? Because it was my initiative to invite the journalists 
from the UNPA. Your colleagues came here to witness the signing 
of an agreement on the cessation of hostilities. Enough said 
about this; let there be no speculation about who is to blame 
for the talks not taking place. Of course, the Serbs will most 
likely try to shift the blame on to us. I can say that had it 
not been this reason they would have thought up some other one. 
At this stage they are clearly not prepared to talk. 
  If they were to talk they would want to discuss certain 
points of the agenda which they would like to stick to -- and 
these would certainly not be acceptable to the Croatian side. 
In particular, after the Zagreb agreement they interpreted the 
accord as if they had been given a state and now they have to 
solve some vital problems, such as water, electricity, 
equipment, and so on -- problems that are normally solved by 
other states, such as Italy, Austria -- among themselves. This 
is of course a stand that Croatia cannot accept and that we will 
not and cannot accept. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by S.K.: "Anniversary of 114th Brigade of Croatian </F>
Armed Forces"] 
  [Text] The Croatian Armed Forces [HV] has not 
completed its mission until we have returned the dead to their 
graves and the living to their homes, said Corps General Janko 
Bobetko. 
  Split--The third anniversary of the founding of the 114th 
Brigade of the Croatian Armed Forces--the first reserve brigade 
of the HV--was celebrated Sunday with a ceremony at the Croatian 
National Theater in Split in the presence of numerous guests, 
led by the chief of the HV General Staff, Brigadier General 
Janko Bobetko. Besides the soldiers, officers, and NCO's of the 
114th Brigade, the ceremony was attended by the families of the 
fallen members of that brigade and by disabled veterans of the 
homeland war. 
  On that occasion, Gen. Janko Bobetko conferred 18 old-style 
flint pistols on the most prominent members of the 114th 
Brigade, and the names of the fighters in this brigade who have 
earned the praise of the president of the republic, the chief of 
the HV Main Staff, and the commander of the Split Corps Region 
were read aloud before the entire audience. 
  Addressing the honored soldiers and guests, Gen. Bobetko 
emphasized the leading role played by the 114th Brigade in the 
homeland war. "If it had not done what it did on the southern 
front, and in the Neretva valley, together with other HV units, 
we would not have Dubrovnik today," Bobetko said. He 
specifically addressed the families of the fallen fighters and 
the disabled veterans of the homeland war, stressing that they 
owe Croatia nothing, but that Croatia owes them everything. He 
also told the members of the 114th Brigade that the Croatian 
Armed Forces has not completed its mission "until we have 
returned the dead to their graves and the living to their homes." 
  The 114th Brigade of the HV was founded on 1 June 1991, and 
its first commander was now-retired Brigadier Ante Catlak. It 
was established to defend the people of Split, Omis, Trogir, 
Solin, and Kastel. Its military missions took it through 
Svilaja, Kijevo, and Vrlika to the Neretva valley and Dubrovnik. 
Its current commander, Major Slaven Zdilar, gave special 
emphasis to the brigade's role is halting Mladic's hordes in 
January 1992, when they attempted to penetrate all the way to 
Split. Among the 114th Brigade's important operations was the 
maritime landing of 104 soldiers at besieged Dubrovnik in 
October 1991 and that battle of Bosanci above Grad, which 
defined the defense of Dubrovnik. 
  Over the past three years, nearly 6,000 soldiers have passed 
through the 114th Brigade; 70 of them have given their lives for 
a free Croatia, and 200 of them have been wounded. 
  At the afternoon ceremony in the "Split" Hotel, the families 
of fallen Croatian defenders from the Split-Dalmatian Zupanija 
were given "Zrinski i Frankopan" medals.

    [Editorial Report] As elections draw nearer--they are 
scheduled for 30 September-1 October--a progovernment weekly has 
criticized Slovak writers for being heavily involved in partisan 
politics. Commentator Nina Hradiska, writing in the 2 May NOVE 
SLOVO BEZ RESPEKTU, charged that unspecified writers are 
becoming increasingly vocal in support of their candidates and, 
"forgetting their proper social mission," some of them are 
acting as unabashed partisan activists. "With great zeal, they 
are turning into politicians...day in and day out, they display 
the irresistible urge not only `to be with it' but also `to be 
in it.'" This misplaced enthusiasm, according to Hradiska, is 
particularly noticeable when there is an opportunity "to get 
publicity and an equally important chance to get lucrative 
rewards." This, she said, reminded her of a popular joke from 
the communist period: "Why do we build socialism with such 
enthusiasm? Because it is easier than to work!" She concluded: 
"Today the easiest thing is to dabble in politics." 
  A recent article printed in the weekly LITERARNY TYZDENNIK, 
published in Bratislava by the Syndicate of Slovak Writers, an 
organization leaning ideologically toward former Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar, seems to bear out Hradiska's critical 
contention. 
  Writing in the 29 April issue of LITERARNY TYZDENNIK, the 
veteran novelist and essayist Vladimir Minac attacked by name a 
number of prominent Meciar opponents who support the current 
anti-Meciar coalition. With emotion, Minac rejected their 
political credentials and characterized them as turncoats, who 
have abandoned "the cause of Slovak freedom. " He found them to 
be a peculiar kind of "political transvestite," without 
principles and conscience, who shun daylight and public 
disclosure, preferring "to change their clothes and their makeup 
under the cover of darkness, often behind the castle walls [an 
allusion to the residence of the Slovak president], because they 
hate it when people catch them while they are changing their 
disguise; they would much rather appear in public already 
freshly remade, complete with their old speech defects and their 
brand new faults." 
  One after another, Minac presented his fanciful character 
sketches of Ludovit Cernak, Roman Kovac, Michal Kovac, and Peter 
Weiss. Cernak and Roman Kovac were described by him as musclemen 
showing off their newly acquired muscle power. Michal Kovac--the 
name in Slovak means "blacksmith"--is presented as attempting to 
shoe an unruly, kicking horse (Meciar), while Peter Weiss, 
previously "the humble servant of the working man," was 
portrayed sporting the "armor of power," which prevents him from 
"hearing the voices of his neighbors." 
  The brunt of Minac's derision was reserved for the KDH 
[Christian Democratic Movement] chairman, Jan Carnogursky, who 
was presented as "the senior master of Slovak political 
transvestitism." Minac accused him of hypocritically pretending 
to be a champion of Slovak independence while exerting great 
effort to extinguish it." In a cryptic and bizarre reference to 
Carnogursky's involvement with the German Adenauer Foundation, 
Minac also charged Carnogursky with being in the service of the 
Order of German Knights," which for many centuries efficiently 
and charitably kept exterminating Carnogursky's dear neighbors, 
the Poles." Carnogursky, suggested Minac, "either has no 
historical memory or is a man...without norms and thus also 
without conscience." 
  Minac summed up his observations by charging that the 
contemporary Slovak "political scene is rapidly being victimized 
by bolshevism" and that "lies are becoming rampant in it." He 
branded the present "broad" governmental coalition of left and 
right parties "a fusion of black cassocks with pink panthers," a 
political arrangement that is bound "to accomplish the full 
rebolshevization" of the country. Should it succeed, warned 
Minac, "that would be it, amen, darkness." He then proceeded to 
criticize also the Slovak media, which he accused of 
subservience and a lack of moral convictions. Slovak 
journalists, charged Minac, "are literally outdoing themselves 
in enjoying their new mercenary role as they provide the new 
ministers [of the Moravcik government] the most fitting answers 
to appropriately chosen questions--the same way it used to be 
during the dullest times of the old regime." He concluded: "They 
find themselves in a state of bliss because now they have 
available a great number of new orifices they can crawl into. 
Transvestites dance to their own peculiar music. That is why 
transvestite politicians need their own transvestite media."

  [Text] A coalition agreement on future cooperation was 
reached on 15 June between the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement in Slovakia and Coexistence. Ildiko Nagy reports from 
Bratislava on the details: 
  [Begin Nagy recording] It lays down close political 
cooperation, the setting up of joint bodies, a dual election 
coalition, and further expansion with a third partner. The two 
sides also agreed that they would begin discussions soon with 
the Hungarian Civic Party on expanding the dual coalition into a 
triple one. 
  In answer to a question from Hungarian radio's correspondent 
[Nagy], Bela Bugar, chairman of the Hungarian Christian 
Democratic Movement, said he was satisfied with the result 
because they managed to achieve what the movement's national 
executive asked the negotiating delegation to do: to try to form 
a triple coalition. The two partners have already agreed on the 
conditions for this; however, this will be made public only 
after the dual coalition agreement is signed next week. 
  The documents adopted at the 8 January 1994 Komarno rally 
constitute the basis of the agreement. If these are acceptable 
to the third party--that is, the Hungarian Civic Party--then, in 
the view of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
chairman, they will succeed in forming a triple election 
alliance. [end recording]

  [Text] Businessman Rudolf Mosny is putting himself forward 
in the new role of politician and is entering onto the Slovak 
political scene. Yesterday, he briefed correspondents on his 
new political movement, New Slovakia [Nove Slovensko] 
(established on 6 May 1994), whose aim is to reverse the 
unfavorable development and to renew the citizen's faith in the 
legislative and executive bodies. The New Slovakia movement 
acknowledges the basic principles of modern liberalism, founded 
on the inviolability of democratic values, and affirms an 
effective market economy that provides social guarantees. The 
movement will join the preelection campaign and is counting on 
getting into parliament. So far, it is represented in about 
half of the districts in the Slovak Republic.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova </F>
"prepared by" Igor Zvach in Bratislava; date not given: "Brigita 
Schmognerova, Deputy Prime Minister for the Economy, Discusses 
Transformation and Its Pitfalls in NARODNA OBRODA"] 
  [Text] When we organized an informal meeting in the 
editorial office last fall, to which, among other economic 
experts, we also invited Mrs. Brigita Schmognerova, we had no 
idea that the next time she visited NARODNA OBRODA she would be 
a deputy prime minister. As an economist, she is--what 
else?--deputy prime minister for the economy. How does she view 
current economic problems? We now offer you an abridged version 
of her answers to some of the many questions we literally 
showered upon her. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] We ventured forth on the road of economic 
transformation virtually from one day to the next. First, the 
gung-ho system, then a certain sobering up, hesitation, and 
doubts--all the way to a slow down. Now it seems that there is 
again a certain speeding up. What does the present government 
intend to do, even though the period of its activity is 
curtailed by the date of the early elections, to ensure that 
transformation acquires an irreversible character? 
  [Schmognerova] First of all, I would like to say that this 
question is slightly hypothetical. Transformation is an 
existential necessity, and the outcome of the elections should 
not--I hope--change anything in this regard. The fact that the 
government can slow down or speed up transformation is another 
matter, and a responsible government cannot view a complicated 
process such as transformation merely from the point of view of 
time. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] All right, let us be more specific--what 
now and what later? 
  [Schmognerova] First and foremost, it is necessary to 
realize that changing ownership is one of the basic tasks for 
transforming the economy. Privatization has become "stuck" and 
complicated recently. Now that the government has decided to 
speed up privatization by means of coupon privatization and 
standard methods, we may assume that the whole process will 
start moving again. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] There was often talk about part-payment 
sales. What do you think of this option, for example? 
  [Schmognerova] Part-payment sales is one of the 
privatization methods. Does this really have a positive impact 
in our situation? Reality shows that it does not. The new owner 
often has trouble with paying the first installment, let alone 
all the others. Therefore, it is necessary to realize that it is 
more effective to sell to someone who is solvent. This does not 
mean that part-payment sales will not be implemented at all; 
they will not be given priority, however. The fact that a new 
owner is not always a good owner is another thing. For this 
reason, it is also necessary, for example, to consider that it 
would often be better to encourage the good managements of 
enterprises--for we do have them--so that they take part in 
ownership. It is necessary, for example, to reappraise 
managerial agreements and to motivate people, let us say, by 
guaranteeing them the option of purchasing shares in the event 
that the enterprise achieves good results. Incidentally, there 
are several of these places. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] The problem of the dire financial situation 
facing many enterprises has become very pronounced--and not only 
recently. They frequently could do something and knew how to do 
it, but where is the money to come from? 
  [Schmognerova] We have somehow "inconspicuously" moved over 
to a different package of problems. Here also, however, it is 
necessary to ponder the issue over a longer time frame. In 
essence, I see a solution to the dire financial situation in the 
business sphere on two levels. First and foremost, in the 
business sphere itself, where so-called bad debts from the past 
prevail. Here it is necessary to find a mechanism for finally 
ridding these enterprises of these debts if they really know how 
to proceed next. We are looking for an effective mechanism. 
Nevertheless, it is already clear that no mechanism for 
clearing debts will help some enterprises. Following tough 
analyses, it is no longer possible to hesitate with liquidation. 
On the other hand, it is also necessary to improve the 
situation in the commercial banks. It is very difficult to get 
credit at the moment. The banks have considerable financial 
resources tied up in the enterprises, and they are not even 
granting credit for propitious projects. The cautious credit 
policy adopted by the National Bank of Slovakia, which was 
reacting to the unfavorable monetary development in the fourth 
quarter of 1993, is also one of the reasons for the shortage of 
credits. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Credit really is a special chapter. Do you 
see any possibility of improving the current situation? 
  [Schmognerova] I have already outlined it. On the one hand, 
by helping to resolve the financial situation in the business 
sphere and, on the other, by improving the portfolio of the 
commercial banks. It does not just involve this, however. If 
the banks were to continue to administer themselves, as many 
have done until now, we would not achieve much. It is also 
necessary to make improvements here. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] Foreign credits have been discussed for 
quite some time, but there is still no significant change. Why? 
  [Schmognerova] Look, some people think that foreign 
organizations are hesitating, that they are waiting to see what 
happens in the elections. It is not like this, however. The 
negotiations with the IMF are coming to a head, and negotiations 
are under way with the World Bank on a standby loan and on 
credit for the financial restructuring of the enterprises and 
the banking sphere and so on. If these negotiations are 
successful, the way is open for other lines of credit. 
  Many potential creditors often ask me: Will you receive a 
standby loan? This will be an important signal for them that it 
is possible to have confidence in Slovakia. The fact that, 
despite the many loans already obtained, there is a problem in 
drawing on them is something else. There is a lack of good and 
propitious business projects. This should change. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] As we are discussing the IMF and the World 
Bank, these institutions couple the provision of loans to 
compliance with specific recommendations. However, complying 
with some of them often provokes opposition... 
  [Schmognerova] It is necessary to admit that these financial 
institutions are not charitable organizations. Credits from 
them have advantageous repayment periods and interest rates, but 
the state that wants to obtain them has to prove that it will 
not fritter away the money, that it will use it effectively, and 
that it will guarantee its returnability. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] However, the majority of the 
recommendations will not much improve the current situation of 
less solvent and averagely solvent citizens. And, some of the 
recommendations are not discussed much... 
  [Schmognerova] There is no reason not to talk about them. 
After all, the implementation of some of them is already being 
prepared--for example, increasing the state budget's revenue by 
means of a higher tax burden or cutting some subsidies. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] This is the very subject of the increased 
criticism... 
  [Schmognerova] I really see no pressing reasons for this. 
Indeed, this involves categories of luxury goods and services. 
A mistake was made when certain items that are really not 
luxury items found their way onto the lists. The government 
will rectify this. However, it is necessary to add that we would 
have had to adopt these measures whether we wanted to conclude 
an agreement on a loan with the IMF or not. So, we were faced 
with a dilemma: either to adopt them, which would have been 
reflected in price increases of about 3.4 to 4.4 percent, and 
thus resolve the crisis situation in health care, education, and 
in providing child allowances, or not to adopt them and 
irresponsibly burden the budget with a further several dozen 
billion [korunas], which would have to have been paid in future 
years. Or--and this was also a possibility--to condone the 
total collapse of health care and education or get ourselves 
into a situation in which we would be unable to pay child 
allowances to the really needy. Here is just one example--why 
pay for some luxury cosmetic operations from the paltry 
resources for health care? After all, this is absurd. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] And what about the issue of a later pension 
age or lower pensions? 
  [Schmognerova] You have opened a large and sensitive package 
of issues, so my answer will also require more space. This 
involves a series of social issues. I would begin by saying 
that, compared with the past, the IMF and the World Bank have 
altered their approach to us and, thus, also their method of 
negotiating. While at the beginning--a year ago--these 
institutions came to Slovakia with their proposals for an 
economic program on whose basis the negotiations were then held, 
the approach now is different. We have drawn up our analyses, 
we have proposed certain courses of action, and we have sought a 
concessionary and acceptable solution. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] For example, then, the issue of later 
retirement? 
  [Schmognerova] It is a fact that, in Western countries, this 
limit is higher than in our country. For example, in some 
places it is 65 years, or even 67 years, for men. We have 
countered this argument, however, by explaining that these are 
countries with a higher average age, an age to which their 
inhabitants live. The situation in our country is, 
unfortunately, worse. Therefore, this issue was discussed, but 
the Slovak Government did not commit itself to any step. 
However, few people know that this commitment--raising the 
retirement age to 65--is written into the Memorandum on Economic 
Policy to obtain a so-called Economic Recovery Loan from the 
World Bank, which was signed in January 1994. 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] What about the social security net? 
  [Schmognerova] We simply cannot conceal the fact that our 
all-embracing and generous social security net (although this 
does not sound nice) does not encourage enough people to want to 
improve their situation through their own efforts. There are 
plenty of examples. It is often better for a person to be 
unemployed. We also allocate child allowances in an almost 
across-the-board manner, and often people who really do not need 
them receive them. We took, for example--let us admit it--a 
politically accommodating step [with regard to the trade unions] 
when we agreed to the formation of a social fund. But... 
  [NARODNA OBRODA] This "but" may be very significant when we 
realize that this fund is (likewise) a considerable incursion 
into the state coffers... 
  [Schmognerova] Certainly, although the concessionary 
solution is far from the burden of the original proposal from 
the trade unionists. It is, however, true that the inadequate 
targeting of social aid and the various additional squeezes on 
capital--such as the social fund--reduce the amount of what we 
can really use for those who need it most.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "The Rapid Deployment Brigade Is Not Only </F>
for the United Nations's Needs"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Army has devised a different 
system for combat readiness and combat alert than under the 
former regime. At that time, "an enemy attack was expected 
every minute." This ensues from the current military-political 
situation within whose framework a so-called unexpected war in 
Europe can no longer break out. Therefore, even the Slovak 
Army's special battalion, intended to fulfill UN peacekeeping 
tasks, cannot be deployed without lengthy intergovernment 
negotiations and decisions. This statement was made by Defense 
Ministry State Secretary Major General Andrej Sabol. 
  He was reacting to a report published at the end of last 
week 
in the daily SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, which, in connection with the 
formation of a special unit intended for the UN's needs, stated: 
"Specifically, this means always keeping on alert at home a 
battalion of professional soldiers who have to be ready for 
immediate deployment." Gen. Sabol added, in this connection, 
that it should be the so-called rapid deployment brigade that is 
the best trained and ready for deployment anywhere on Slovak 
territory. He emphasized that it should not only be deployed 
for the Army's needs, but also, for example, in ecological or 
technological accidents. The special battalion may also be 
deployed for UN peacekeeping purposes; however, it is necessary 
to overcome several problems. These include mastering the 
English language, and the command system has to be compatible 
with that of the United Nations.

  [Text] Skoplje, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Some 250,000 members of 
the Association of Serbs and Montenegrins in the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.M.) will not boycott the upcoming 
census, but have doubts as to its regularity. Association 
President Nebojsa Tomovic assessed that the census was designed 
to provide a basis for dividing the F.R.Y.M. between the 
Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. It was also to enable 
federalization of this republic after the American-designed 
model used in the case of the Bosnian Moslem-Croatian Federation. 
  The F.Y.R.M. has a population of about two million, 
according 
to the latest census in 1991. Ethnic Albanians accounted for 21 
percent, although they claim their number was higher. "All this 
is being prepared behind the back of the Macedonian people, and 
the in-the-field decisions are being taken by American 
politicians according to intructions from Washington. The Serbs 
in Macedonia fully share the fate of the Macedonian people and 
oppose such U.S. plans on federalization of Macedonia," he said. 
  The census, Tomovic added, was designed to reduce the number 
of Serbs in the F.Y.R.M. to an insignificant figure and thus 
eliminate their influence on the final outcome of such plans. 
Tomovic described as a provocation by the Macedonian 
authorities the fact that many Serb nationals -- originally from 
Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija -- when 
obtaining F.Y.R.M. citizenship papers discovered that Macedonian 
police had put down they came or were born in the "State of 
Kosovo". 
  A strong separatist movement of ethnic Albanians, demanding 
a 
separate state and its secession from Serbia, was active for the 
past two decades in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and 
Metohija. The Serbs and Montenegrins were increasingly 
frequently questioning the validity of the upcoming census, and 
even their participation in it because of the rigorous 
conditions set by citizenship legislation. Among other things, 
it requires 15 years of permanent residence in the F.Y.R.M. to 
obtain Macedonian citizenship. 
  It is believed that several thousand Serbs and Montenegrins 
would not meet the conditions required for obtaining 
citizenship. In this way, the participation of the Serb 
community in the overall population of the F.R.Y.M. would drop. 
The F.R.Y.M. authorities, say Serbs accounted for about 2.2 
percent of the population, while the Serbs there claim they 
number about 250,000, or above 10 percent.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Clients' Money Is Not at Karic </F>
Bank"] 
  [Text] The delay in the payment of the savings deposits at 
Karic Banka has been lasting for 10 months now. In this period, 
the payment of the denar savings was carried out in limited 
amounts and with deferred payment. The citizens were able to 
withdraw 1,000 denars ($22.2) only as monthly interest, while 
they could not get the rest of the principal and interest. 
Firstly, the clients were offered to extend their agreement for 
fixed term deposits to another three months and then withdraw 
their principal and interest, but even after this period of 
time, they did not get anything. 
  There are often quite unpleasant scenes between the clients 
and the bank clerks at the bank, sometimes the sums of the 
minimal paid interests are written in Serbian language, and in 
dinars, instead of denars. Karic Banka does not have a 
guarantor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]. The National Bank of Macedonia only 
guarantees for those banks which are registered according the 
new law, that is , which received working licenses. Karic Banka 
is a branch bank of a foreign bank and has the same treatment as 
the business units of other banks which have head offices 
outside the state and which are guaranteed for by that foreign 
state. This means that the clients are only left to settle the 
agreement signed at this branch office in the court in Belgrade, 
which gives little hope when it is known that also in Serbia, 
the citizens were cheated out their money by the Serbian banks 
"Jugoskandik Banka" and "Dafiment Banka". 
  In September last year, Karic Banka had a debt to 8,000 
clients of up to three million German marks and then it was said 
that this debt would be taken over the bank AKA, which opened a 
representation in Skopje and which is the first foreign branch 
bank registered in Macedonia. However, AKA Bank is 
disassociating itself from any connections with Karic Banka. It 
works with the economy, that is, crediting companies, but not 
the population. Although the public knows about the connection 
between AKA and Karic Banka for some time, AKA Bank denied this, 
these days.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
president of the People's Assembly of the Bosnian Serb Republic, 
told TANJUG today that the maps, under review by the Contact 
Group for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, were far from 
acceptable for the Serbs. We have had a preliminary look at the 
maps, but we are expecting some improvements, that is, 
corrections. If that happens, it will be create favorable 
conditions for the restoration of peace in Bosnia, Krajisnik 
said. He particularly stressed that the maps, which have been 
circulated, were causing concern and fears among the Serb people 
that they could be imposed on the Serbs in their current form. 
  The maps considerably affect the vital interests of the Serb 
people and, in fact, they are destroying the achievements of our 
struggle for the homeland, which is impermissible. I do not 
want to pass any judgments on the maps. However, I am expecting 
reasonable proposals because we presented our objections and 
explained why we could not accept their proposals. We also 
invited the Muslims side to present their stances. 
  We are awaiting a response with great interest. Our reaction 
to the response will in any event be in line with the proposals 
adopted by the Serb Republic People's Assembly at the last two 
sessions, Krajisnik said in conclusion.

<F P=106> ["I.V."-initialed commentary: "Krajisnik: Affirmation of </F>
the Struggle for the State"] 
  [Text] According to the information of the Serbian news 
agency SRNA, the day before yesterday, Chairman of the Serbian 
Republic People's Assembly Momcilo Krajisnik received a 
delegation of the initiative committee for the preparation of 
the republican assembly of the Association of the World War II 
Chetnik Veterans from Ravna Gora. "The Chetniks were great 
patriots and they fought for the Serbian national question," 
Krajisnik emphasized on that occasion, emphasizing that the 
current struggle of the Serbian people for freedom and national 
state "can be compared to the struggle of the Chetniks during 
World War II." 
  "Our state and political leadership and the Serbian 
Democratic Party [SDS] are determined to create national 
reconciliation and affirm the patriotic struggle for the 
creation of the Serbian state in the years 1941 to 1945 to the 
utmost, even nowadays when a struggle for the final solution to 
the national question is being fought," Krajisnik specified, 
voicing his personal sympathy for the Ravna Gora movement. The 
president of the Serbian Republic Assembly also emphasized that 
the memory and the continuation of traditions will always exist 
within the affirmation of the Chetnik movement, adding that the 
state should regulate the celebration of all significant events 
from that period with legal acts. "If somebody will turn 
against the SDS now only because we are reaffirming the 
Chetniks, then let him," Krajisnik concluded. 
  The representatives of the initiative committee demanded 
from 
Krajisnik that the movement of General Draza Mihajlovic's Ravna 
Gora Chetniks be legally rehabilitated and that the 
association's constituent assembly at the republican level be 
held in the shortest possible time. After the meeting with 
Krajisnik, the initiative committee held a session on the 
premises of the Serbian Republic Presidency at which it was 
concluded to "wait for the reply of the Assembly until 15 July, 
and afterward hold the founding assembly of the association in 
Pale or Ilidza." 
  President of the Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Seselj, who 
has in the meantime dissolved his Serbian Chetnik movement, says 
that members of the Serbian Radical Party and the SDS took part 
in the organization of the new association, however, not as 
party representatives, but as veterans. Adding that the 
initiative for the creation of the association originates 
precisely from the ranks of the Serbian Radicals in the Serbian 
Republic, Seselj says that he fully supports any action aimed at 
rehabilitation of the Chetnik movement. 
  The Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO] is very surprised by the 
Bosnian Serbian leadership steering into Ravna Gora waters, 
especially, when one recalls that, until yesterday, even General 
Mladic himself would be taking cockades off the soldiers' caps. 
Milan Komnenic emphasizes that the Ravna Gora movement never 
propagated, and even less carried out, ethnic cleansing, nor did 
it propagate that the Serbs could live by themselves. "There 
were some people on the fringe of the Ravna Gora movement who 
had committed crimes and behaved aggressively and we are worried 
by Krajisnik's promotion of his own ideas about the Ravna Gora 
movement that have no connection whatsoever with this movement."

  [Text] Colonel (Plafait), authorized representative of the 
UN Headquarters for Bosnia-Herzegovina, today presented 
Brigadier General Enver Hadzihasanovic, commander of the General 
Staff of the Supreme Command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, 
with a proposal to deploy UN observers in charge of monitoring 
and reporting on the observation of the cease-fire agreed upon 
in Geneva on 8 June, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army press center 
informs. The proposal of the UN Headquarters for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is in accordance with the conclusions of the 
meeting of the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the 
United Nations. It envisages the construction of 66 observation 
points in the southwest and northeast sectors. 
  The Serbian aggressor's side has not delivered its proposal 
to the UN Command for Bosnia-Herzegovina yet. The final version 
on the observation posts can, therefore, be expected at the next 
meeting. The General Staff of the Supreme Command of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army continues to insist on an improved 
number and place of deployed UN observers, especially in the 
Bihac and Gorazde regions. If the observation posts are not set 
up on the territories temporarily controlled by the Serbian 
aggressor's side, then we will not accept and allow observation 
posts to be constructed on the free territory of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is written in the statement by the Army 
Press Center. 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army proposal on the number of 
liaison 
officers and line of administration and command has been 
accepted in its entirety by the UN Command for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The proposal facilitates efficient 
surveillance and reporting by the incumbent commands on the 
observation of the cease-fire.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 17 June carries in its 
regular four-minute newscast several reports confirming 
cease-fire violations in the republic. 
  Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports on the situation 
overnight and says that "this has been one of the hardest nights 
since the beginning of the chetnik aggression and particularly 
since the outbreak of the armed rebellion organized by the 
Kladusa outlaw [Fikret Abdic] in the border areas of the Cazin 
and Velika Kladusa communes. Overnight, and particularly after 
0300, the chetniks from the so-called Serbian autonomous 
province of Krajina used artillery to pound the wider areas of 
Skokovi, Pecigrad, Todorovo, and [name indistinct]. In addition 
to howitzers, they used multiple rocket launchers, so that the 
Cazin citizens are in shelters. The forces of the traitor army 
savagely attacked Pecigrad and Todorovo. As the attacks are 
still in progress we have no information on the consequences." 
  The 206th Chivalrous Zvornik Brigade Information Service 
correspondent reports that "the aggressor is continuing the 
usual cease-fire violations. In the course of the afternoon 
hours until late into the night, antiaircraft machine gun and 
small arms provocations were registered in Sapna, Kraljevici, 
and Kobilici, and along the forward defense lines in the area. 
The aggressor used 120-mm mortars to target our positions on 
Skakovica and Pandurica. The chetniks are continuing their 
provocations in the morning hours, but our troops are not 
responding." 
  Kladanj correspondent (?Muris Seho) reports that "in the 
course of the night, our defense lines on the southeastern part 
of the Kladanj front were targeted by the Romanija chetniks. 
The enemy mortars, Praga, and antiaircraft machine guns were 
particularly directed at the region of Konjevici. Ten 82-mm 
shells landed in the area. The chetniks from Hadzici continued 
small arms' provocations." 
  The 3d Corps Press Center correspondent reports that "the 
chetniks must have signed the cease-fire agreement using 
invisible ink, because events on the fronts in the 3d Corps 
theater of operations cannot be described as a cease-fire. The 
attacks were fiercest on the Zavidovici front, where the attacks 
began with the pounding of our defense lines in Hajdarevici and 
Imamovici. An infantry attack followed. Antiaircraft and small 
arms' provocations were registered on the Doboj and Teslic 
fronts. The rapid passage of buses and trucks on the 
Doboj-Pridjel-Preslica route is proof that they are preparing to 
launch fresh attacks in this area. The situation was similar on 
the (?Seric) front. Our troops are not responding to the 
provocations."

  [Text] In the afternoon, the united aggressor intensified 
the attacks on the free territory of the Bihac district. The 
outskirts of the Cazin commune have become the target of the 
artillery from the strongholds in the so-called Serbian 
Autonomous Region of Krajina. The members of the treacherous 
Abdic's phalanxes have started new artillery and infantry 
attacks on (?Trsac), Krivaja, (?Vidkovac), [word indistinct], 
and (?Kodrovi). They have been bringing fresh forces and 
military hardware all the time, especially to the area around 
Vidkovac and Pecigrad. Karadzic's chetniks on the Bihac, 
Bosanska Krupa, and Buzim part of the front have been attacking 
with antiaircraft arms. Their infantry arms provocations lasted 
the entire day, while their sniper fire has intensified, too. 
The reliable reports claim that there are indications that 
Abdic's war-mongering headquarters in Velika Kladusa has been 
arresting the workers of [words indistinct] and marching them 
through the town as captured members of the 5th Corps.

  [Text] Zvornik, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem and 
Croat forces continued to violate the one-month ceasefire in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bosnian Serb military sources said Thursday 
[16 June]. Bosnian Moslem and Croat troops, whose political 
leaders three months ago signed a U.S.-mediated federation 
agreement, continued offensive action in numerous areas of the 
former Yugoslav republic. Around the town of Orasje in the 
Posavina region of northern Bosnia, joint units of Bosnian 
Croats and regular Croatian Army troops made sporadic artillery 
attacks on Serb positions. 
  Soldiers from the regular Croatian Army have been deployed 
in 
and around Orasje since the start of the Bosnian civil war in 
April 1992. The Bosnian Serb forces suffered no losses in the 
latest attack and did not return fire, Serb military sources in 
Brcko said early on Thursday. Bosnian Moslem forces opened 
mortar fire on Teslic, a town in northern Bosnia, wounding six 
civilians, including two children, Serb military sources said. 
  The Moslems also launched attacks in a wide region around 
the 
northern Bosnian town of Doboj and the Borci region between 
Kalinovik and Konjic in eastern Herzegovina. Heavy Moslem 
artillery attacks were also reported around Kladanj in eastern 
Bosnia. Bosnian Serb sources reported that Moslem units opened 
fire in the Sarajevo region, firing mainly into Sarajevo's Serb 
residential areas of Ilijas and Hadzici.

  [Text] New York, June 16 (TANJUG) -- The United Nations has 
no information about any "ethnic cleansing" being practiced in 
the Bosnian Serb town of Banja Luka, a U.N. spokesman said on 
Thursday [16 June]. The statement was prompted by a NEW YORK 
TIMES report from Sarajevo alleging that an "ethnic cleansing" 
campaign in Banja Luka in western Bosnia-Herzegovina has 
intensified and that more than 3,000 Moslems and Croats have 
fled the town under Serb pressure in the past two months. The 
U.N. secretary-general's spokesman Joe Sills said that a Moslem 
offensive had abated after having raged for weeks and that the 
truce signed by Bosnia's belligerents at Geneva on June 8 was 
holding in the main, except for fierce fighting around Bihac in 
the west between rival Moslem factions loyal to hardliner Alija 
Izetbegovic and his moderate opponent Fikret Abdic. 
  Abdic and his supporters rebelled against Izetbegovic's 
war-mongering policy and last autumn proclaimed their autonomous 
province of western Bosnia and signed peace accords with Bosnian 
Serbs and Croats. Sills said that Bosnian Serb forces had been 
holding a Nordic medical convoy near Rogatica, southeast of 
Sarajevo, for the past three days in violation of an agreement 
on free passage throughout Bosnian territory. Asked if it was 
true that the convoy had refused to submit to a routine check, 
Sills replied that, according to his information, the Serbs were 
asking for more than a routine check, which he said was giving 
rise to concern.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item; By Stevan Cordas] </F>
  [Text] Belgrade, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Massive arrival of 
troops from Islamic countries to Bosnia-Herzegovina, where they 
are joining the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
threatens to turn the U.N. "blue helmets" into "green" ones. 
Around 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani and 1,200 Bangladeshi 
troops are expected to arrive in Bosnia next summer. When all 
the planned troops have arrived, UNPROFOR will have soldiers 
from as many as six Islamic states -- Turkey, Pakistan, 
Malaysia, Egypt, Jordan and Bangladesh. 
  The current situation indicates that this may not be the 
final figure becuase some other Islamic countries have showed 
great interest in sending their own peacekeepers to Bosnia. 
Those who know the situation in Bosnia claim that massive 
arrival of troops from Islamic countries had been initiated by 
Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic. He needs peacekeepers 
from Islamic countries for two reasons. The first one is that 
they would give him an additional military power under the 
current conditions of the arms embargo. The other one is 
connected with the attempt to Islamize Bosnia. 
  Izetbegovic's intentions are clear. Well-informed sources 
believe he will try to use Islamic peacekeepers for 
strengthening the influence of Islamic fundamentalism in the 
Bosnian Moslem enclaves. Some analysts in the West claim that 
most of the Moslem population in Bosnia is not inclined to 
Islamic fundamentalism. Izetbegovic must therefore be backed by 
a real power in his effort to `persuade' his own people that it 
is necessary to accept Islamic fundamentalism. 
  So-called holy warriors from Islamic countries, who have 
been 
fighting alongside Bosnian Moslems since the beginning of the 
civil war, have not had much success so far in helping 
Izetbegovic implement that ideology. On the contrary, their 
behaviour has turned many Bosnian Moslems against them. 
Izetbegovic therefore needs `fresh forces' with the image of 
peacekeepers and he has found such troops in Turkey, Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, etc. 
  There is an impression that the world's most powerful 
factors 
involved in the the settling of the Bosnian conflict are 
indiferently watching the arrival of troops from Islamic 
countries to Bosnia. Such a stand can be understood only as yet 
another in a series of expressions of support to the Bosnian 
Moslem side since the beginning of the war. U.N. 
Secretary-General Butros Butros-Ghali has found himself in an 
awkward position because Western countries are not ready to send 
fresh troops to Bosnia. On the contrary, the most powerful 
countries are indicating the possibility of withdrawing their 
peacekeepers. 
  On the other hand, Islamic countries have no problems in 
financing their peacekeepers serving as part of UNPROFOR. Under 
the circumstances, Butros-Ghali has no other option but to 
accept what is offered. Consequences of such an attitude, 
however, do not seem to be considered.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Vlado Pandzic, chairman of caucus of </F>
Croat deputies, by Ivan Sabic; place and date not given: "There 
Are Differences, But Not Divisions"] 
  [Text] Unanimity among Croat deputies is proof of our 
political will to work on making the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Federation a reality, says the chairman of the caucus of Croat 
deputies. 
  We spoke with Dr. Vlado Pandzic, the chairman of the caucus 
of Croat deputies, right before he left Sarajevo, where he had 
participated in the session of the Constitutional Assembly of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, and then in the session of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly that followed as a continuation. 
The reason for our interview was in fact these two meetings, and 
Dr. Pandzic had this to say in evaluating the results achieved: 
  [Pandzic] Everything that was anticipated was also done, so 
that I can say that a big step was taken in realizing the 
Federation Constitution. The federation got a president and vice 
president, and certain decisions, drafts, and proposals for laws 
were adopted, which are a precondition for carrying out the 
further work of setting up the federation. 
  [Sabic] Were there any changes in mutual relations between 
the first and second sessions of the Constitutional Assembly, 
was there any discernible change in the prevailing atmosphere in 
the Assembly meeting rooms? 
  [Pandzic] One could say that the atmosphere was better at 
the 
second session, that work proceeded somewhat faster.... As with 
any beginning, at the first session there was a certain amount 
of disorientation, but nevertheless we overcame that 
successfully. It is important that at both the first and the 
second session a high level of preparedness on the part of the 
deputies was discernible, there were no "derailments" from the 
agenda, the deputies demonstrated the will to achieve what had 
been planned, while at the second session one could discern a 
little more certainty that everything on the agenda would be 
completed at that session. Perhaps it can be said that some 
individuals stood out in terms of their disorientation, but that 
does not essentially alter the overall impression. 
  [Sabic] No less than two months passed between the enactment 
of the federation and the election of the federation's leaders, 
but the Constitution states that they be chosen as soon as the 
Constitution is adopted. Do you think that the next steps will 
not fall that far behind schedule? 
  [Pandzic] I call those two months lost time, which does not 
mean that that should be understand literally, because during 
that time some doubts and disagreements were resolved, 
everything that had generated a certain level of tension. 
Perhaps we could have taken several more steps during those two 
months, but I think that we will pick up the pace a little. This 
is reflected by the fact that in two weeks there will be another 
session where the government will be elected. 
  [Sabic] The last session of the Constitutional Assembly was 
interrupted by unexpected breaks, the session began late.... It 
is surmised that there were disagreements that had to be ironed 
out behind closed doors. 
  [Pandzic] A certain number of deputies arrived in Sarajevo 
late, and because of that the session was late in starting, so 
that on the first day of the session only a small part of the 
planned business was covered. The next day, in fact after 
meetings between the chairmen of the caucuses and the Assembly 
presidency, full agreement was reached. And right before the 
election of the federation president and vice president, there 
was a brief interruption in the session. The chairman of the 
Assembly wanted to fully clarify the issue so that unnecessary 
questions would not be raised later on, and for that purpose he 
organized a short meeting. It must be kept in mind that the 
Assembly is meeting in Sarajevo, a city that is completely 
encircled, in a hall that cannot be called adequate, while the 
Serb forces are positioned all of several hundred meters away. 
  [Sabic] It can often be heard in Sarajevo that there are 
plenty of Croat deputies who are opposed to the implementation 
of the Federation Constitution. Is that perhaps one of the 
reasons for the delays in the session? 
  [Pandzic] It cannot be said that there are no differences in 
views of the federation agreement. However, that is not 
discernible in the Assembly itself. The differences are more 
evident at meetings of the caucus of Croat deputies, there one 
might get certain impressions that could not exactly be called 
the best, but that must not be the real conclusion. The most 
essential thing is that all Croat deputies raised their hands 
for the Federation Constitution. 
  [Sabic] Both from the Assembly podium and on other 
occasions, 
you often emphasize the unanimity of the Croat deputies in 
expressing their views on any issue. Why do you think that such 
unanimity is essential? 
  [Pandzic] It would be enough to determine that there is a 
majority. Still, I think that it is not unimportant to mention 
that there is unanimity, because that, among other things, 
refutes the allegations of a supposed division among the Croat 
deputies. Through unanimity, we demonstrate our political will 
to work on making the federation a reality. 
  [Sabic] For deputies who live outside Sarajevo, the fact 
that 
they receive meeting materials immediately before the session 
begins is a big problem. Will there be changes in that in the 
future? 
  [Pandzic] That is indeed a rather big problem that also made 
the deputies' work more difficult. Very few people managed to 
read through everything that they were supposed to. I must say 
that this time these materials were very well prepared, very 
precise, that they did not raise issues that slow down the work, 
and some of them, the Federation Constitution for example, we 
received printed in both the Croatian and the Bosniak language. 
It was agreed that in the future materials will be provided in a 
timely fashion, so that this problem too will be removed from 
the agenda.

  [Text] Belgrade, 14 Jun (TANJUG) -- Colonel General Momcilo 
Perisic, chief of staff of the Yugoslav Army, said this evening 
in an interview for Serbian Radio and Television's first program 
that soldiers are never the ones to decide whether there would 
be war or not. 
  In his interview on the occasion of 16 June, Yugoslav Army 
day, General Perisic stressed that if it were up to soldiers to 
decide on matters of war and peace, they would always opt for 
peace, because professionals are well aware of what war entails 
and how extensive material destruction can be. 
  As a professional army, we have been carrying out orders 
issued by state structures and implementing political decisions. 
  The transformation of the Yugoslav Army, Perisic underlined, 
is primarily based on the establishment of state control over 
national defense, that is All National Defense [Opste Narodna 
Odbrana], on a new military doctrine, and other recent 
regulations. The basic objective is for us to remain masters in 
our own home, to defend the territorial integrity of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY], that is of the Serbs, 
Montenegrins, and all national minorities, because this is a 
bourgeois state. It is important to develop the defense 
capability of society as a whole, especially the army's combat 
readiness -- not in the sense of deploying this army outside the 
borders of the FRY but, first and foremost, of preventing any 
aggressor from threatening the country's security. 
  The transformation of the Yugoslav Army is based on a series 
of real factors. This transformation fully corresponds with our 
doctrines, that is, with the protection of the population of our 
country. First and foremost, we are bearing in mind the real 
threat coming from abroad. We are also bearing in mind our real 
material capabilities and, of course, our human resources. 
  In addition to this, we had to create units that are capable 
enough of preempting surprise threats in peacetime and at the 
same time flexible enough in wartime to create a massive army in 
a short period of time. Naturally, the transformation of the 
Yugoslav Army is an ongoing process, a process that encompasses 
everything -- ranging from organizational and structural 
changes, to the modernization of weaponry and equipment and the 
army's visual identity. 
  Commenting on the fact that the largest part of the military 
industry has remained on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, 
Perisic said that the loss of territory and military industrial 
facilities is certainly a problem besetting today's Yugoslav 
Army and the overall defense capabilities of society. By 
carrying out an organized evacuation we nevertheless managed to 
capture most facilities and to save all our technical 
blueprints. Thus, while carrying out the transformation of the 
Yugoslav Army, we are also securing conditions for manufacturing 
vital pieces of combat equipment in our factories. 
  The modernization of the army refers primarily to the 
modernization of the combat training system and supplying the 
army with new hardware, i.e., weapons and systems. During this 
period we have managed to replace or substitute the manufacture 
of the equipment we used to have until yesterday, either by 
modernization or by utilizing the collective scientific brain. 
We have managed to develop some new equipment which replaces 
the equipment we used to manufacture, only it has far better 
features, i.e., far better combat specifications, the chief of 
staff stressed. 
  "In the light of the economic blockade of our country, in 
the 
light of the fact that a war was and still is being waged in the 
area of the former Yugoslavia, all of this has a negative 
influence on our total economic power and, consequently, on the 
Yugoslav Army too. Anyone who ignores the correlation between a 
country's economic potential and the financial resources 
earmarked for the army harbors unrealistic views. This is why 
the budget earmarked for the Yugoslav Army is precisely as big 
as our society could provide at a given moment, namely 7.43 
percent of the national product." 
  In response to the criticism that the Yugoslav army has 
perhaps retained some characteristics of the former Yugoslavia, 
the general said: The multiparty system has been introduced in 
our country, and many party leaders would like to have an army 
that suits them and, consequently, not everyone's wishes can be 
fulfilled. The most dangerous thing for any army, in any 
multiparty society, is the possibility of political parties 
interfering in the army's personnel policy. The sharpest 
criticism has been that the army has been depoliticized through 
the process of transformation. We pay great attention to the 
personnel policy, and we know -- and this is perhaps the 
greatest contribution to the transformation of the army -- that 
the Yugoslav army units are now being led by exceptionally 
capable people, people of great knowledge, ability, dignity and 
pride, people who are prepared to and capable of predicting 
events and making decisions in line with the combat capability 
of their units and the overall potentials of our society. 
  It has always been, and still is, very important in the 
training and education of officers for them to be honest toward 
their own people and their soldiers, and to be exceptionally 
shrewd regarding their enemy. 
  However, unfortunately, due to wrong training of the 
officers 
in the Yugoslav People's Army [former Yugoslav army -- JNA], all 
their capability was directed toward organizing themselves and 
leading the army so as to protect the country from an external 
enemy, completely ignoring the possibility of an internal enemy. 
Due to their naivety, many acted in a way they should not have 
done. Naturally, during this civil war, from Slovenia to Bosnia, 
many officers were not up to their task, and they fared as they 
deserved. 
  A JNA unit under a capable officer did not suffer losses in 
either its equipment or people, and did not surrender. The 
Croats and the Slovenes have achieved everything they have 
achieved by deceit or some other method, but certainly not 
through armed combat. 
  Speaking about patriots and patriotism, Perisic said that 
this human quality develops and grows throughout one's life. 
That is an exceptionally important quality in the Yugoslav 
army, I would say a quality without which tasks cannot be 
successfully completed. Therefore, in some important aspects, 
the officers must be proven patriots. To be a proven patriot 
means to be ready to help one's own people in most difficult 
times, to share the fate of the people, and to be ready for the 
greatest of sacrifices. 
  General Perisic went on to say that NATO was set up to 
protect the interests of its member-states and it ought to be in 
the service of all these countries equally. 
  However, it began serving the interests of one country which 
is the architect of the new world order. 
  It is completely clear that NATO has somehow been abused, 
but 
in the final analysis, its raison d'etre following the 
disintegration of the Warsaw Pact is pointless, unless it wishes 
to continue doing what it is doing now. 
  Of course, many NATO effectives have been brought to the 
vicinity of the FRY to support forces which took an active part 
in the disintegration of the former Socialist Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia [SFRY], and now in their attack on the republic of 
Serb Krajina and the Srpska republic; given that they are in our 
immediate vicinity, they are indirectly threatening the security 
of the FRY, but we have to know that they are not here only to 
help the secessionist forces, but also to exert some pressure on 
our country. 
  Consequently, our country is under a multifold embargo, on 
the one hand under a complete economic blockade and on the other 
surrounded by NATO warships which pose a kind of threat to the 
security of the FRY. However, as we have much experience, and 
in the light of the four-year war waged by our compatriots 
living outside the FRY, we are aware that their presence could 
in a sudden turnabout bring into question the security of the 
FRY, and therefore we have been taking certain measures to avoid 
surprises of any sort. 
  Perisic said that the civil war on the territory of the SFRY 
came about because of foreign influence and the skillful use of 
internal contradictions. As this civil war is primarily based 
on religious and national antagonisms, rather than on some other 
factors, there is a danger of it spilling over to the territory 
of the FRY, following a similar principle. Normally, since the 
architects of the new world order, when drawing up their 
scenario, did not reckon with the heroic resistance put up by 
the people of the two Krajinas, they were halted in some degree. 
That process has even been paralyzed, and if we continue to be 
united as much as we have to be in order to protect our national 
being, then we could even halt that process. Bearing all this 
in mind, the FRY has been trying to a maximum degree to stop the 
war on the territory of Bosnia as soon as possible, and in this 
respect has been offering support to all peace-loving forces in 
the world in preventing the spread of the war eastward, i.e., to 
this area here. 
  Perisic was asked: As they are constantly threatening us 
with sanctions and bombardment, is there any reason to be 
frightened? 
  Perisic replied: "Certainly, when the very fabric of society 
is endangered a certain degree of fear is inevitable." 
  "In view of our experience throughout history, as well as 
the 
war under way, waged by our compatriots in the Republic of Serb 
Krajina and the [Bosnia] Serb republic under extremely 
unfavorable conditions, they have shown us that they could 
successfully withstand a numerically far superior opponent for 
four years now; moreover, this opponent is backed by the world 
media, not only morally but also logistically, including the air 
force [as received]. The conclusion to be drawn is that the 
Serbian and Montenegrin soldier, the Serbian and Montenegrin 
people, and the national minorities are ready and able to defend 
themselves -- with the Yugoslav army as their axis." 
  The general commented on relations with The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, which has received UN troops on its 
territory, most of whom are Americans. Of course, they are not 
there to protect the Macedonian people, but to set up their 
bases and, among other things, to help them secure their 
borders, as the Macedonians neither have the manpower nor the 
material resources to organize a modern army. However, as the 
border line is administrative and is not clearly defined, 
American soldiers are often apt to get lost and cross onto FRY 
territory, either out of ignorance or misinformation. All of 
these intrusions have been registered, some were thwarted or 
took place without incident. 
  However, since someone in the world wishes to turn every 
border violation into an incident, we are often accused of this. 
I had several meetings with the UN commander for Macedonia to 
this effect, I warned about frequent border violations and he 
promised this would discontinue. Nevertheless, I am not so sure 
some of these violations are not deliberate. As far as 
accusations that Yugoslavia is amassing troops along the 
Macedonian border are concerned, this is "pure media 
fabrication." 
  The situation along the Albanian border is almost identical 
in the sense of border incidents. 
  Young men from Kosovo and Metohija and the Raska region, 
Shiptars and Muslims are dodging military service in the 
Yugoslav army, and since they are harboring illusions about 
violent secession, these young men are being sent for military 
training to various centers abroad through different channels. 
On their return -- by way of testing their abilities and 
smuggling arms on a grand scale -- they are entering our country 
illegally. As our border patrols try to prevent them from doing 
this, incidents occur. They are using weapons during these 
illegal crossings. Unfortunately, these incidents often have 
tragic consequences for the infiltrators, which the 
unsympathetic world is exploiting very efficiently in its media 
campaign against our country, Perisic said. 
  The Yugoslav army, Perisic said, is a factor of stability 
for 
Yugoslavia as a whole, including stability in the region of 
Kosovo and Metohija, thanks to other elements and the people's 
support [as received]. I believe that the average Kosovo 
Albanian, that is Shiptar, would never choose the war option 
because he can see clearly enough what is happening in regions 
where people are trying to resolve something by force. 
  Second, they can also see the living standards of their 
compatriots in Albania. It suffices to climb a mountain near 
the border to realize what a vast difference there is between 
the economic might and living standards of the Shiptars on this 
and on that side of the border, for the Shiptars in Kosovo and 
Metohija are at least ten times better off than their 
compatriots in Albania. I believe that all they have been 
creating under the fold of the FRY and Serbia is such material 
wealth that they would hate losing it in some showdown not of 
their own choosing, but imposed by their leaders. But they were 
wise enough not to have accepted this. If they had, they would 
have lost so much. They are aware of this, so I do not believe 
such a thing could happen. Even if it does, the army and 
militia in Kosovo, as well as other social factors, will be 
ready and able to defend the territorial integrity of their own 
country. 
  The Yugoslav army and the FRY leadership are making 
tremendous efforts through various international factors and 
through political and military factors in Bosnia to effect peace 
there as soon as possible -- because we know that only peace, 
not any kind of peace but a just peace, can put an end to 
destruction and halt the suffering of all three peoples. 
However, there can be no peace if all three peoples are not 
equally determined to achieve it. 
  Will there be fresh aggression, a major offensive? 
  I am certain that a major offensive is a realistic 
possibility if the international factors responsible for the 
civil war in Bosnia do not exert pressure on the Muslims and 
Croats. I am sure that it will not be more successful than the 
ones so far, and you know that all of them ended in failure. 
  If these Muslim-Croat forces, the Muslim-Croat coalition, 
were to be aided by certain international factors, especially 
NATO, then the situation would naturally be far worse. However, 
I do not believe the international community would allow such a 
thing to happen, and if it did, the consequences would be 
disastrous, not only for the people of the Srpska republic, but 
for the entire population of the Balkans, Europe, and further 
afield. 
  Perisic commented on Croatian President Tudjman's statement 
that he would return Krajina into Croatia's borders and its 
state system by force: 
  ``In view of the fact that there has been a political rift 
in 
the Republic of Croatia and that Tudjman is losing ground, 
everything is possible -- he could push the Croatian nation into 
another war in a feverish attempt to hold on to power. What the 
chances are to return the republic of Serb Krajina into 
Croatia's borders are perfectly clear from the operations on its 
borders so far. 
  "Even though they engaged the entire country with help from 
the international community in a war against a far smaller 
nation, they did not manage to do anything; the Serbs have 
managed to protect their territorial integrity and did not allow 
deeper incursions to be made." 
  How much can inter-party bickering influence the Yugoslav 
army and how much has the army protected itself from internal 
political divisions? 
  ``It is obvious that the unity of a country is inevitably 
reflected in the unity of an army. The army is a social 
category which in every country, ours included, to a higher or a 
lesser degree reflects developments in society. The stronger 
the consensus between parties on vital issues of importance for 
the survival of a nation, normally the more positively is this 
reflected on the overall situation in the army, particularly its 
combat morale. 
  "The stronger the disunity, the stronger influence it has 
over the army; but as we have said, the army has been 
depoliticized, it has got well-built defense mechanisms for the 
prevention of such negative influences, I think that the party 
influence on the overall combat readiness of the army is 
marginal." 
  The Yugoslav army peace-time force is by its quality and 
quantity completely equipped to prevent any surprises. It is 
always capable of taking adequate measures to prevent any 
surprises, even under the most adverse conditions. This means 
that a very short period of time is necessary to transform the 
peace-time force into a war-time force of over 500,000 men, 
which now completely suffices to protect the nation from foreign 
threats of any kind, Perisic stressed.

<F P=106> [Article by A. Milutinovic: "New Story--Sad Ending"] </F>
  [Text] By mid-May, the commercial banks had loaned to the 
domestic economy about 800 million dinars of credit to 
"invigorate" production. Thanks to that financial injection, 
Yugoslav industry increased its output 12.4 percent in February, 
21.3 percent in March, and another 3.4 percent in April. At 
first glance, the authors of the program for monetary 
reconstruction and economic recovery have reason to be content. 
But at the same time there are also many reasons to be 
concerned. In the first four months of this year industrial 
production is all of one-fifth below what it was in the same 
period of last year. Let us remind those who are forgetful: The 
country's social product last year was equal to the one in 
far-off 1963. 
<H5>  "Overnight Coverage" </H5>
  The commencement of Avramovic's program was characterized by 
markedly "animated" credit activity of the banks, which recently 
has essentially dwindled. Only here and there do you hear that 
any of the more than 100 commercial banks has granted a new loan 
to the economy. Faced with this development of events, the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia [NBJ] has on two occasions tried to 
get additional funds for new loans by reducing the legal 
reserves (5 percent at the moment). But that effect melted away 
in just a few days, so that many bankers are demanding more and 
more loudly that the rate of the legal reserves be reduced to 
zero, that is, be done away with. In that case, that is, every 
dinar deposited could be loaned out. 
  The same objective is behind the demand to bring back once 
again the principle of "overnight coverage," which would mean 
that the negative balance of any bank could temporarily be 
covered from the accounts of another bank. Up to now, it was 
very expensive to go "in the red," and any negative balance had 
to be covered through a sale of foreign exchange to the central 
bank, and so the bankers were much more cautious. This, 
unfortunately, did not last long, and the principle of mandatory 
coverage of a negative balance with foreign exchange was very 
quickly abandoned. 
  Government bodies and agencies are continuing to insist on 
new bank loans in order to increase output. That is quite 
understandable. It is in the interest of the state for as many 
enterprises as possible to be in operation, because that also 
means fewer unemployed workers, who have to be financed from the 
garners of the state. At the same time, neither the federal nor 
republic government nor the central bank really cares all that 
much in the end whether and when any of those loans will be 
repaid. The risk falls only on those who actually invest the 
money in certain firms, and that means the bank and its 
depositors. Because most bankers are aware that even the banking 
sector will not be able to survive long without financial 
rescue, none of them is really all that anxious to reproach 
those who will later decide whether a bank is going to go into 
bankruptcy or perhaps be rescued. That is why the present 
situation might be described in just four words as "shut up and 
give." 
<H5>  Rescheduling </H5>
  Incidentally, there is no other way to explain the fact that 
many firms are coming for a second round of loans when they 
still have not repaid the first loan. Even though the date for 
repayment of the principal and the accrued interest agreed to 
has already passed. Still more strangely, many banks are meeting 
those demands more and more frequently and in that way turning 
themselves into "wishing wells," and only the rare ones dare to 
slam the door in the face of delinquent debtors. 
  The daily press has been writing about this quite a bit in 
recent days. The example of the Motor and Tractor Industry [IMT] 
in New Belgrade is a typical example: On 10 May, it applied for 
a new loan from Beobanka, although it had not repaid the 
previous loan of 19 million dinars. In order to improve the 
chances of their management, the workers at IMT went on 
strike--instead of asking the top management of their firm where 
the millions obtained in February disappeared. The colleagues 
from IMT were soon joined by trade union officials of IMR 
[Rakovica Motor Industry] in Rakovica, 21 Maja, Precizna 
Mehanika in Zemun.... 
  It all inescapably reminds us of the old tried-and-true 
formula. The only essential thing is to "channel in the right 
direction" the anger of the workers, and the loan is certain to 
be forthcoming. They are forgetting that this is the best way of 
destroying the stabilization program for certain. If decisions 
on the granting of new loans should be made by trade union 
officials together with inept managers of large firms, this will 
be a sure sign that the money is going into a bottomless hole. 
And because there is no bottom, there is no source from which to 
return what has been borrowed. 
<H5>  Return of the State </H5>
  In the present phase of realization of the program for 
economic recovery, the bankers are supposed to forbid access to 
their vaults to all those who still have not repaid old loans. 
  Otherwise, they will never again be able to say "no" to 
anyone. Rescheduling automatically means that there will be no 
money for projects for which credit support of the banks is also 
indispensable. 
  In this connection, there was the rather symptomatic 
announcement of the most responsible government officials that 
some firms cannot be left hanging and must be provided new loans 
although they have not repaid those already granted. This is 
justified on the alleged grounds that production has still not 
been rounded out. At the same time, it is not clear why this 
state does not loose the strings of "its own purse" and finance 
such programs from the budget, if it is so convinced that the 
market will confirm their value. 
  Governor Avramovic himself has been mentioning Zastava in 
Kragujevac more and more loudly, although it is clear to 
everyone that the average Yugoslav does not have money for a 
Yugo, and those who have managed to get rich in a short time 
prefer a Mercedes. The state must decide once and for all where 
its interest lies and then finance that itself, leaving 
everything else to free competition on the market, in which it 
will not be issuing any indirect orders as to who should do what. 
  It is clear to everyone that the growth of production is one 
of the conditions for economic recovery. But people seem to be 
forgetting that production is not an end in itself and is worth 
nothing until it finds a customer on the market. What is more, 
enterprises must discharge their obligations not only to the 
state, which in spite of all difficulties, has been collecting 
its tribute quite regularly, but also to the bank from which the 
loans were taken. Incidentally, if all the loans granted so far 
had been repaid with interest, nearly 900 million dinars would 
very quickly build up once again in the banking system. Only 
then could bankers freely decide how much of that money to lend 
to whom in the future. This way, one can get the impression that 
what has been borrowed is being repaid only by firms that have 
no one of their own in the top government leadership or in the 
management of the bank. 
<H5>  The Credit Financing of Losing Operation </H5>
  Attention should assuredly also be paid to the fact that the 
commercial banks have begun to extend foreign exchange loans to 
the NBJ. This has already been done by Jugobanka, Beobanka, 
Investbanka, Union Banka, Komercijalna Banka.... Nikola Stanic, 
M.A., NBJ vice governor, has even boasted in public that he has 
had no time for anything except concluding contracts with the 
bankers for foreign exchange loans. The basis for that is 
contained in the law recently adopted for the FRY to borrow $300 
million in foreign exchange and to use the foreign exchange 
collected in that way as support for the new dinar. It has 
already taken in several tens of millions of marks in this way, 
and this is giving rise to new dilemmas. 
  Aggrieved foreign exchange savings depositors are wondering 
how the banks have foreign exchange to lend to the state, when 
at the same time they say that they are unable to pay them their 
foreign exchange savings? The bankers justify themselves by 
saying that this is the foreign exchange of their customers, 
large socialized or government-owned firms, as though there is 
writing on every mark, dollar, schilling, or franc saying to 
whom it belongs and who deposited it in the bank. One gets the 
impression that this justification does not really hold water. 
But everything is possible here. 
  At the same time, the question arises of what interest the 
bank has here, when we know that the repayment period for those 
loans is two years, and there is a grace period of one year, and 
the rate of interest is the rate of interest in the country from 
which the currency comes? These conditions, which are not overly 
attractive, give rise to the suspicion that this is some kind of 
government "racket," so that certain bankers have no other 
solution than to take the foreign exchange from their vaults and 
"voluntarily" turn it over to the central bank, that is, to the 
state. 
  This version becomes quite convincing when we realize that 
many firms are ready to offer much more favorable conditions 
than the state for foreign exchange loans. But for them there 
simply is no foreign exchange. This suggests the conclusion that 
it is not all as voluntary as they would like to portray it. For 
the present, the story about those foreign exchange loans is 
very much like what happened with the loans to invigorate 
production. The media are overloaded with the numerous deals 
that have been concluded, and almost no one asks how and when 
those loans will be repaid? In what way will the state be able 
to repay the interest and accrued interest in a period of two 
years? If it does as it has done up to now--all those who have 
given their money can say good-bye to it. By way of consolation, 
there remains the hope that at some point the state might change. 
  Finally, the conclusion can be drawn that the public will 
soon be confronted with a new form of credit financing. This 
time they would have the principal role and would be using their 
money to help to increase production and support stability of 
the national currency. The idea of the new loan for "economic 
rebirth" has been launched by Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, NBJ 
governor, with a justification that sounds a bit naive, to the 
effect that he did not even know about the previous loan and 
what happened to it. New projects and programs that will compete 
to use the money obtained by floating the public loan are to be 
gathered over the next month or two. So, whoever wants to, let 
them do it. In order to correct at least to some extent the 
impression, the government would first have to force the 
enterprises who have so far borrowed money from the banks to 
repay those loans. Otherwise, the public will not be able to 
expect its money back either. And that would then mean that 
there is yet another story on the horizon with a sad ending.

  [Text] For over a month now, Serbian soldiers have been 
entrenching along the border with Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], raiding constantly on the 
territory of the neighborly country. The Serbian soldiers, who 
are also deploying mortars along the border, are in the direct 
vicinity of U.S. Protection Forces soldiers, who have not 
reacted so far. It is also reported that the Serbian soldiers 
have entered up to 300 meters into Macedonian territory.

  [Text] Belgrade, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic, 
president of the Republic of Serbia, today received Radovan 
Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, following the 
latter's return from Moscow. He briefed Milosevic on his talks 
with Russia's top representatives, particularly with Russia's 
Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, regarding the peace process in 
former Bosnia- Herzegovina and efforts to advance it 
successfully, the office of the Serbian president has announced. 
  Peace is undoubtedly the highest interest so the Serb side 
will contribute as much as possible to a political solution to 
the crisis, the statement says. 
  As stated, satisfaction was expressed with Russia's unbiased 
attitude and its efforts to help negotiations between the 
warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as with expectations 
that the international community secure equal treatment for 
every participant in this process.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Cvijetin Milivojevic: "With `the Front of </F>
Peace' Against `the Coalition of War'"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that one of the best informed men 
in Yugoslavia, who is at the same time the host at the Palace of 
the Federation, [Federal President] Mr. Zoran Lilic, thought 
about Radovan Karadzic, Biljana Plavsic, Ratko Mladic, Vojislav 
Seselj, Milan Babic, and perhaps about Vojislav Kostunica and 
some other political leaders of the Serbs from Serbia, 
Montenegro, and Bosnia, after he had been supported by Borislav 
Mikelic, the Krajina prime minister. 
  The fact that the president of the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia is virtually only the spokesman of those who 
concentrated the real political power in their hands, is less 
important than the fact that Zoran Lilic recently officially 
proclaimed the things that had started several months ago. 
Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president -- who forced himself 
on the so-called international community as the only relevant 
representatives of the Serbs and who is aware of the dark 
economic future of Serbia should the sanctions last for "1,000 
years" as he said himself -- was allegedly promised by the West 
that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would quickly return to 
the world if peace and a political solution were reached in 
Bosnia. 
  According to this version, it is Milosevic's turn to make a 
move now. He should, as quickly as possible, force the Bosnian 
Serb leaders to agree to the 51 to 49 percent division of 
Bosnia. In return, Serbia and Montenegro would gain the same 
status in the international community as the other former 
Yugoslav republics. Through the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the 
state of the Bosnian Serbs would be entitled to reconstruction 
aid, just like the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia 
would profit from the reconstruction aid, too, since it is 
probable that there would be confederal connections between the 
Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. At the end of the peace agreement implementation 
process, the Bosnian Serbs would be allowed to secede from the 
Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- if they want to, naturally. 
  Since the initial idea about the political elimination of 
Radovan Karadzic, as one of the impediments to this aim, has not 
proved to be quite efficient, other options are being considered 
now. One of them is that the president of the Srpska republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina cedes his unpleasant role of signing 
agreements about the Serbian withdrawal from certain territories 
to somebody else in order to retain the image he has in the 
Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The other possibility is 
to apply the model of Milan Babic's elimination from the leading 
position and find a new leader. The options include Nenad 
Kecmanovic, Nikola Koljevic, and some less-well-known people. 
"Well-informed" sources even claim that the commander of the 
army of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina [Ratko Mladic] 
has been offered a high-ranking position in the Yugoslav Army if 
he is ready to make compromises. 
  Naturally, all these ideas will not be activated if 
Karadzic's negotiating team approves of the general model for 
the partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Official Belgrade would 
compensate them for their approval by insisting that the Serbs 
"get good territories," first of all the corridor along the Sava 
River and a part of Sarajevo. 
  The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is now working on the 
creation of the so-called big "coalition for peace," which 
consists of the following parties, as we have learned so far: 
the Socialist Party of Serbia, the Democratic Party of Serbia 
[Depos], the Socialists of Montenegro, and the New Democracy. 
In order to gain the favor of the West, the regime would 
especially like the verbally most powerful opponent of the 
Socialists, Mr. Vuk Draskovic, to enter the coalition. Dusan 
Mihajlovic -- the new New Democracy leader, who is trying to 
establish contacts between his coalition partners from the 
republican government and his election partners from DEPOS -- 
has been assigned this task. 
  That this is not a joke has been confirmed by the event that 
took place at a recent SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] Main 
Committee session, in which Draskovic told his only remaining 
vice chairman, Mr. Dragoslav Milacic, that he [Milacic] would 
become federal minister. The SPO chairman is allegedly 
interested in becoming ambassador to the United States, which is 
the position also desired by Dragoljub Micunovic, the most 
famous Democratic Party "dissident." According to reliable 
sources, Vuk Draskovic was also very keen on entering the 
government of national unity, so the present events can be 
considered a continuation of the things that had already been 
begun. The SPS has the newly established party of Slobodan 
Rakitic in reserve, since the questionable DEPOS seats in the 
Chamber of Citizens depend on the ruling coalition. Apart from 
the use of force according to the principle "if you do not want, 
Rakitic will take it," the SPS is also applying other 
tried-and-tested measures, such as the activation of SPS 
extended arms in the SPO. 
  If the SPO agrees with this proposal, the regime will 
finally 
isolate the Serbian Radical Party. The second candidate that 
would remain outside the "national front" would be Kostunica's 
Democratic Party of Serbia, and Djindjic could choose between 
watching how his party opponents are favored and trying to reach 
power himself. 
  The general pressure on the complete opposition, "which 
should make the opposite become normal again," comes from clear 
statements issued by the SPS that it will not organize early 
elections, which would push the opposition "to the margin," as 
Mirko Marjanovic would say. Four leading opposition leaders 
claim that the opposition now only agrees about the name of 
Radoman Bozovic, the radio-television, and the election system. 
This is too little to be able to speak about an efficient 
resistance to the intentions of the leading parties. 
  It is clear that the results of the latest differentiation 
on 
the Serbian political scene will depend primarily on the course 
of the peace negotiations in Bosnia.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic </F>
"exclusively for Dnevnik 2" by Dusko Petrovic on 16 June; place 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Petrovic] Today the new government is exactly 90 
days old. How would you briefly assess its work? 
  [Marjanovic] After 90 days, there is a stable dinar, stable 
prices, a consolidated balance without a deficit on 24 July 
[date as heard], increased wages, and an increase in real 
consumption, as well as a standard of living that has more or 
less risen. That is everything that was included in the program. 
  It has to be said here that I expect this to continue. I 
also expect systemic laws to be implemented in the spirit of the 
further realization of the program. 
  [Petrovic] The Serbian Government endorsed the proposed 
package of taxation laws yesterday. In the speech you made 
today [at the Economists' Conference in Budva], you assessed 
that package as a system that is close to the taxation systems 
in most developed market economies in Europe. Do you expect the 
Assembly to adopt the package and to completely agree to it? 
  [Marjanovic] I do. These are expert issues, so I do not 
believe there will be any differences if the decision is made on 
the basis of expertise and of what has been presented in the 
program. 
  There could only be some bickering among the parties. 
Otherwise, I think that the draft laws in this sphere have been 
drawn up well and to a professional level. After all, I saw 
this confirmed by economists, our scientists today. Therefore, 
I expect any debate (?in the assembly) to be like this, at 
expert level, and this should be the case, so I do not think 
there will be any particular resistance to it. 
  [Petrovic] Mr. Prime Minister, you are absolutely convinced 
that the program will be fully successful. Six months have 
passed and its results have contradicted the doubting Thomases. 
  [Marjanovic] Yes, I am convinced and I see that many of our 
scientists today are optimists. I am more of an optimist, as 
they have nevertheless expressed some skepticism about the 
future, pointing in particular to the problem of property 
transformation. However, in my opinion, many things were omitted 
in the debate and we nevertheless have many chances of 
succeeding, regardless of whether sanctions will be lifted or 
not. 
  [Petrovic] Thank you very much. 
  [Marjanovic] Not at all.

  [Text] Krusevac, Yugoslavia, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) has lost 60 billion dollars as a direct or 
indirect result of sanctions in the past two years, Serbian 
Vice-Premier Slobodan Unkovic said on Thursday. 
  In order fully to grasp the enormity of the losses, it 
should 
be said that Yugoslavia's projected national product for 1994 
stands at 13 billion dollars, Unkovic, who is also Serbia's 
minister of science and technology, told reporters of 
influential Bulgarian newspapers who arrived on a three-day 
visit to Krusevac, central Serbia, on Thursday. 
  The United Nations voted the sanctions in place in May 1992 
because of Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in civil war in 
neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico, who also attended 
the talk, said that the only thing Serbian authorities insisted 
on in their contacts with foreign media reporters was truthful 
reporting. 
  Vico said that this kind of reporting would give a much more 
objective picture of Serbia and Yugoslavia and the situation in 
the lands of former Yugoslavia.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] An article by Vesna Kostic and 
Aleksandra Bilanovic in the 13 May edition of the Belgrade news 
weekly NIN examined the increase in the number of wealthy people 
in Serbia and the manner in which they achieved their wealth. 
Only a few of the newly rich became so through "entrepreneurial 
ability," according to the authors. The rest acquired their 
wealth through "connections and acquaintances, institutional 
concessions, market monopolies, and natural resource 
concessions." NIN pointed out that some of the new rich, 
"through lobbying and bribes, ensured privileged positions for 
themselves in the granting of loans (especially last year from 
primary issue, or currency issued without backing), the 
distribution of strategic products, and the issuance of permits 
to engage in the import-export trade and real estate 
transactions." 
  The article cited Dr. Aleksandra Posarac of the Belgrade 
Institute of Economic Science, who said that "a variety of 
mechanisms for plundering the people" exist and that they offer 
"ideal conditions for amassing enormous capital without work." 
In essence, according to Dr. Posarac, it is a matter of 
redistributing existing public resources. She defined these as 
foreign trade firms and all other public companies; society 
bears the risk while the profit goes into private pockets. The 
Dafiment Bank also played a significant role in the enrichment 
of individuals, in Posarac's opinion. "The lists of Dafiment 
depositors that have been made public account for the 
disappearance of only tens of millions of German marks, but the 
question of what happened to the 200 million that are 
unaccounted for remains. Where are they?" 
  In a box titled "Who They Are and How Much They Have," NIN 
published a list of the Serbian new rich, qualifying it as 
incomplete and based on unverified assessments by business 
partners, acquaintances, and "accessible publications." NIN 
observed that the list shows that the rich are for the most part 
people who participate or participated in the government, who 
were or are directors of public enterprises, and who worked or 
still work in public foreign trade firms. Several of the 
individuals on the list, the weekly noted, have connections with 
Genex, a Belgrade firm also known as Generalexport that, 
according to the 1990 Trade Directory of Yugoslavia, engaged in 
foreign and domestic trade, representation of foreign firms, 
tourism, hotel management, and air transport. The list consists 
of the following names: 
  -- The Karic brothers: Their total assets are assessed at 
$100-150 million; they own firms (trade offices) in almost all 
of the states of former Soviet Union, from Moscow and Kiev to 
Tashkent and Uzbekistan; they have opened firms on the other 
side of the Atlantic; they have at their disposal huge business 
offices in Belgrade; they have a house in Pec, Serbia, seven 
apartments in New Belgrade, and a villa in the Dedinje section 
of Belgrade. They own a huge piece of property near London with 
three medieval castles, one of which has as many as 38 rooms, 
luxurious swimming pools, and a thoroughbred horse farm. 
  -- Zoran Drakulic: His worth is assessed at $100 million; in 
Cyprus he has a company with the name East Point; in Belgrade 
his company is called Ju Point and in Budapest Ein Point. This 
former Genex official "has expanded his business so much that he 
has even opened an office in China." 
  -- Miroslav Miskovic: There are rumors that he has capital 
of 
$35-40 million dollars; former director of Zupa of Krusevac and 
former member of the Serbian Government, he is the largest 
shareholder of the Delta company (foreign trade, a bank, and the 
Deltino restaurant). He has a luxurious villa in "Neimar." 
  -- Zoran Kacar: He is worth $15-20 million; he was the first 
to start purchasing hard currency for deposits into "giro" 
accounts through Interplast Trejd; he owns several apartments in 
Belgrade and a house on the coast; he is owner of a chain of 
bakeries in the United States and a large number of firms in 
Austria, Sweden, Germany, and Cyprus. There is a rumor in 
Belgrade that because of a conflict with the authorities he left 
the country and now lives in the United States. 
  -- Zoran Markovic: He owns the Bel Pagetta firm, and he 
claims that the investment in this project amounted to $2 
million, but "it is unlikely that he has at his disposal less 
than $5 million"; he has been expanding his business into Poland 
and Slovenia and is expected to expand into Romania and The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; he lives in a Genex 
company apartment. 
  -- Nikola Kitanovic: The man who invented "Raul Amon" says 
that the assessment of his worth at over $10 million is very 
modest; he expects a profit of $130 million from a contract 
recently signed with a Chinese firm. 
  -- Dr. Nenad Djordjevic: This former State Security Service 
official and instructor at the Advanced School of the Ministry 
of Internal Affairs is today owner of the VTS firm; his worth 
has been assessed at between $50-130 million. 
  -- Mirko Marjanovic (Serbian prime minister): It has been 
assessed that he has $50 million in cash. 
  -- Dragan Tomic (minister in the Serbian Government, 
coordinator of the new economic program, and director of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's largest furniture company, 
Simpo): NIN did not succeed in discovering his worth, but it is 
claimed that his assets are for the most part in London in a 
firm that belongs to his son, who is in the re-export business. 
  -- Zoran Obradovic: A former Genex employee, he is the owner 
of the Petromet firm; his worth has been assessed at about $10 
million. 
  -- Miki Savicevic: Former director of Genex, he has firms in 
Switzerland and Russia; it is believed that his worth is about 
$10 million. 
  -- Milenko Isakov: He is the owner of the MCS firm, which 
exports copper; his worth has been assessed to tens of million 
of dollars. 
  -- Sinisa Radosevic: also a former Genex employee, he is in 
the agricultural business and is worth up to $10 million. 
  The list does not include Radoman Bozovic, Federal Assembly 
speaker, and Dusan Matkovic, general director of the ferrous 
metallurgy firm Sartid-13 and former minister of industry, 
although their names are "most often publicly mentioned," NIN 
states, adding that this is because no one is willing to give 
any information whatsoever on the way the two obtained their 
wealth and on the amount of their wealth. "Many names are 
mentioned in a whisper and with fear, which not only reveals 
that what is at issue may be the wealth obtained through illegal 
means, but also that these are people who have a tendency to 
resort to violence and malevolent displays of their power." Very 
often what is at issue are personalities from the "demimonde" 
and even the "real underworld." Thus, for example, a certain 
Manda is mentioned as the owner of a rather large number of 
gambling houses and boutiques, but merely mentioning his first 
name is considered to place the safety of one's family at risk, 
NIN says, adding that the same is true of attempts to decipher 
the origin of the wealth of Zeljko Raznjatovic Arkan and his 
close associates. 
  In its 27 May issue, NIN reports that Serbian Prime Minister 
Mirko Marjanovic, whose name appears on the list above, has 
filed a complaint at the First Municipal Court in Belgrade 
against the NIN journalists who wrote the article for "damage to 
his reputation and honor."

<F P=106> [Interview with Montenegrin Foreign Minister Miodrag Lekic </F>
by Milovan Nedeljkov; place and date not given: "We Are Not a 
Part of Small or Greater Serbia"] 
  [Text] One of the "most difficult" politicians for extreme 
Serb nationalists in Belgrade, and very often also for the Serb 
authorities, is the "naughty boy" of Montenegrin politics, 
Miodrag Lekic, foreign minister of Montenegro. Although 
official Belgrade has never publicly complained about the work 
of the Montenegrin foreign minister, they have long been trying 
to force Podgorica to relinquish that ministry and Lekic's 
ministerial function. Most serious accusations come from 
Seselj's radical, who say the young minister (born in 1947) 
intends to separate Montenegro from Serbia and lead it into the 
protection of Italy and the Vatican. He is being reproached for 
having indirectly caused the flogging of Serb tourists in 
Montenegro with his statement that "Montenegro is not a Serb 
state." 
  [Nedeljkov] Belgrade announces the "revitalization" of Yugo- 
diplomacy. Has that anything to do with the abolition of your 
ministry, i.e. your appointment as Belgrade's ambassador to 
Rome? 
  [Lekic] The revitalization, as you called it, of Yugo- 
diplomacy is not connected to the abolition of the Montenegrin 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Things are quite clear -- that 
ministry is based in history and in the Constitution, which is 
more important than occasional attempts to abolish it. This 
important element of Montenegrin sovereignty, realized in 
history in 1878, cannot depend on one man alone. I am going 
nowhere, but even if I were, it could only happen after my 
successor is chosen at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. If I 
were to go to Rome, I would not be the ambassador of Belgrade, 
but of both Podgorica and Belgrade. 
  [Nedeljkov] As the foreign minister of Montenegro, during 
diplomatic missions, have you ever met diplomats from former 
Yugoslav republics? What were those meetings like, if there 
were any? 
  [Lekic] Unfortunately, I met none. I am not avoiding such 
meetings. I believe there will be more such meetings with 
gradual normalization of relations between the republics of 
former Yugoslavia. 
  [Nedeljkov] You once said that Montenegro has "objective 
needs to communicate with the world," and that that is the 
reason for not abolishing the Montenegrin Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs. Does that mean that "your" ministry, contrary to the 
general belief in the West and other former Yugo-republics, is 
not just following orders coming from Belgrade? 
  [Lekic] It is obvious that the Montenegrin Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs is not obeying orders from Belgrade. As a 
departmental organ, the ministry is working on the basis of 
program politics of the Government of Montenegro. 
  [Nedeljkov] How do you feel about the national problem. 
Some people from Belgrade accuse you of betraying the Serb 
national interest. 
  [Lekic] I am a Montenegrin. I am working to help Montenegro 
overcome this difficult and tragic crisis of the collapse of 
former Yugoslavia as painlessly as possible. Since I returned 
from Mozambique, where I was ambassador of former Yugoslavia, 
two years ago, I have been working to preserve the interest and 
reputation of our republic, at the expense of no one. 
  [Nedeljkov] You have recently stated that "Montenegro is not 
a Serb state" and that provoked powerful reaction in Belgrade. 
  [Lekic] Montenegro belongs to its citizens, for its 
Constitution defines it as a civic state, not as a national 
state. If we apply national criteria, then it is a Montenegrin 
state, for the Montenegrins are the most numerous nation in 
Montenegro. However, it is primarily characterized, politically 
speaking, as a civic and democratic state community. 
  [Nedeljkov] Can Montenegro become a member of the union of 
Serb states, which many political forces in Belgrade have been 
announcing? 
  [Lekic] The Montenegrins are a sovereign and politically 
mature nation, so it will be the only factor deciding about 
historic road of the oldest Slavic state in the Balkans. 
  [Nedeljkov] Should Montenegro be a part of a greater 
Serbia? 
  [Lekic] Montenegro cannot be a part of small or greater 
Serbia; it is a state that can join a broader community on an 
equal level. 
  [Nedeljkov] Is the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] a 
democratic, peace-loving federation of two equal states? 
  [Lekic] Being surrounded by war, suffering under economic 
sanctions, it is difficult to achieve the ideals of democracy, 
federalism, and other societal values to the full. There are 
tendencies, certain results, and for true political, economic, 
and cultural emancipation, we must have more favorable general 
conditions, primarily lifting the economic sanctions imposed by 
the international community. 
  [Nedeljkov] The statement by the advisor to the Office of 
Croatia in Belgrade, Mr. Bilandzic, that Croatia could open a 
consulate in Podgorica, was interpreted as a direct attack on 
the sovereignty of the FRY. What do you say about that? 
  [Lekic] I do not consider that statement an attack on the 
sovereignty of the FRY. That is not a new idea and it is worthy 
of being considered and discussed. 
  [Nedeljkov] Does Montenegro have a dual foreign politics 
with regard to the so called "western Serbian countries" and 
Prevlaka? 
  [Lekic] I do not see a connection between the problem of 
Prevlaka and, as you said, western Serbian countries. The 
uninhabited peninsula of Prevlaka, with several hundreds of 
meters of rocky ground, makes a logical whole of the Bay of Boka 
Kotorska. Always in history, ever since the time of the 
Venetians, these areas were governed by the rule that those who 
had Boka Kotorska also controlled Prevlaka. In case of the 
opposite, the narrow bay becomes a joint property, waters in 
that part of the bay are territorial and international, and that 
may lead to incidents which, I believe, are neither in the 
interest of Croatia or our side. I, therefore, expect that a 
just solution will be found in the final peace agreement. 
  [Nedeljkov] Prevlaka, Montenegro, the Republic of Croatia. 
What is the role of Belgrade and Serbia in that? 
  [Lekic] Our institutional connections with the other federal 
unit show that the entire federation is interested in solving 
the problem of Prevlaka. We must point out that Prevlaka is a 
favorite subject of the extremists, who, though they do not 
quite know where it is exactly, think it should be turned into 
casus belli. Potential instrumentalization of Prevlaka for 
military purposes is another reason to join forces to solve this 
problem in a rational manner. 
  [Nedeljkov] Do you believe in future close links between 
former Yugo-republics? 
  [Lekic] All republics of former Yugoslavia are logically 
connected to a point. Montenegro with a strong, sometimes even 
illusionist Yugoslav feeling, has real and potential connections 
with former Yugoslav republics. No republic of former 
Yugoslavia has gone to the moon; rather, we are still neighbors. 
We all have two choices: to take the road of constant conflict 
or that of cooperation. There is no third way. We think that, 
in spite of great differences that were created, we must try to 
establish, first bearable relations and then, as much as 
possible, restore road, economic, and other connections which 
were decades in the making, while we were living together. Of 
course, the beginning of the process requires respect for new 
state entities created on the territory of former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] Pristina, Yugoslavia, June 16 (TANJUG) -- The 
European Union maintains that Kosovo-Metohija should remain 
within Serbia and does not support ethnic Albanian separatist 
aspirations, a delegation of the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (C.S.C.E.) parliamentary assembly said on 
Thursday. 
  Delegation Head Frank Swaelen told Serbian Minister Without 
Portfolio Vekoslav Sosevic that the E.U. viewed as unacceptable 
the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia, says a 
statement released by the province's information secretariat in 
Pristina. 
  Sosevic and representatives of the Kosovo district informed 
the C.S.C.E. delegation that all political disputes in the 
province stemmed from years of separatist activity of Albanian 
extremists and their aspirations for the creation of an Albanian 
state in Serbian territory. 
  They explained that this was why ethnic Albanian parties in 
Kosovo-Metohija were refusing dialogue with Serbian authorities, 
although one had been offered many times. 
  These political groupings will persevere in their separatist 
aspirations and will continue to avoid a dialogue with the 
Serbian authorities as long as there is the least sign of 
support from individual international factors, said Sosevic. 
  Swaelen told reporters after the meeting that the C.S.C.E. 
wanted to examine the possibility of reincorporating Yugoslavia 
in the C.S.C.E., (its membership was suspended in the summer of 
1992) and to this end was collecting information about the 
situation in Serbia's provinces of Kosovo-Metohija and Vojvodina 
and the region of Raska (Sandzak) which is shared by the 
Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. 
  He said he was optimistic about the chances of a dialogue 
between Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo-Metohija. 
  After the delegation's meeting with ethnic Albanian 
representatives on Thursday, the vice-president of the most 
influential ethnic Albanian party -- the Democratic Alliance of 
Kosovo -- Fehmi Agani said that the talk was informative rather 
than anything else and the representatives had informed the 
C.S.C.E. delegation of their well-known stands. 
  A strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement has been active 
in Kosovo-Metohija for decades. it is openly advocating the 
province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation 
to neighbouring Albania.

    [Editorial Report] Several recent items in Czech 
periodicals have discussed the process of reorganizing, 
modernizing, and downsizing the Czech Army. 
<H5>  Command Reorganization </H5>
  The deactivation of the Western and Central Military 
Commands 
and their replacement by two corps commands headquartered in 
Tabor and Olomouc were reported in the 19 April issue of ARMADNI 
REPORT. Lieutenant General Frantisek Podesva, newly named 
commander of II Corps, told the military journal that "the 
purpose of the Army reorganization is creation of a new concept 
of operational command levels." The general stated that the new 
corps would assume some of the functions of the old military 
commands, such as basic training and responsibility for 
"mobilization-asset acquisition," but that some duties, such as 
property management, would be assumed by other components. 
  Below the corps level, the Central Military Command Army 
divisions in the the II Corps area will be converted to three 
mechanized brigades in mid-July, according to ARMADNI REPORT. 
Two Western Military Command armored divisions will be 
reorganized as the I Corps brigades by 1 July, while the 
transformation of the 20th Mechanized Division into a brigade 
within the I Corps will be completed in 1995. Upon assuming 
command of the I Corps, Major General Lubomir Jura stated that 
the emphasis of reorganization and training efforts will now 
shift to the company and platoon levels. Jura noted that Army 
downsizing had so far led to the deactivation of 54 regiment- 
and division-sized units and the release of 16 bases to civilian 
uses. 
<H5>  Training Area Reduction </H5>
  Army cutbacks have included a consolidation of military 
training areas. MLADA FRONTA DNES of 19 May indicates that the 
number of Army training areas has been reduced from eight in 
1990 to five currently. The facilities that were terminated were 
those located at Dobra Voda in Klatovy district, at Ralsko in 
Ceska Lipa, and at Mlada in the districts of Nymburk and Mlada 
Boleslav. The largest remaining training areas are now those in 
Libava and Hradiste. 
  Libava, in the vicinity of Olomouc, is used for practice 
firing from hand-held weapons, self-propelled artillery, 
infantry-combat-vehicle guns, tanks, and field artillery. As of 
1994, it also includes an aerial target range for fighter and 
bomber aircraft. The Army also has 12 firing ranges in the 
Hradiste military training area near Karlovy Vary, better known 
as Doupov, of which the largest are tank, infantry, and 
helicopter firing ranges. The 25,000-hectare Boletice training 
area in southern Bohemia has seven firing ranges, including one 
for helicopters. Training takes place mainly in artillery and 
armored-personnel-carrier, tank, and hand-held weapons fire. A 
similar area at Brdy, near Pribram, serves for artillery and 
tank training as well as air bombing and strafing. The oldest 
training area in Brezina in the Vyskov district, established in 
1935, is used for practice firing by tanks, infantry combat 
vehicles, and artillery. It is the smallest of the training 
areas, comprising 15,000 hectares. MLADA FRONTA DNES notes that 
civilian populations in the regions surrounding the training 
areas tend to complain about the disruptive effects of military 
operations on their daily lives. 
<H5>  Rapid Deployment Force </H5>
  The establishment of an elite rapid deployment brigade was 
described as one of the "key elements" in Army reorganization by 
a 14 May LIDOVE NOVINY article, which also noted that the 
brigade "is one of the few development programs the military is 
able to afford, in view of its tight budget (27 billion korunas 
[Kc])." According to LIDOVE NOVINY, the rapid deployment brigade 
should become operational by 1 July of this year, and its 
formation will cost approximately Kc800 million. The paper 
quoted the colonel in charge of organizing the new unit as 
rejecting any "theories" that the professionalization of the 
Army might fail. He did, however, concede that the substandard 
physical condition of many recruits and the poor condition of 
military housing facilities are obstacles to the establishment 
of an effective professional fighting force. 
  An article in the 19 April military journal A REPORT 
described a press conference by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys 
that was almost entirely devoted to the rapid deployment 
brigade. Baudys said that, like the rest of the military, the 
new unit faced a shortage of qualified junior officers. "Finding 
young people for the brigade should be the start of a 
fundamental change in this respect, but it is a process that 
will require a number of years," stated the minister. As a 
result, said Baudys, the rapid deployment brigade will start as 
a semiprofessional unit to be converted gradually into a fully 
professional one. He added that new methods of attracting 
qualified recruits were being tried, such as use of the concept 
of "extended service time," under which the soldiers would 
receive a one-time cash payment or "temporary retirement pay 
upon completion of [their] term of service." 
<H5>  PM Wants Further Cuts </H5>
  During a recent visit to II Corps headquarters in Olomouc, 
where he was briefed on the status of Army modernization and 
restructuring, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that progress in 
transforming the military was proceeding at about the same speed 
as that of the rest of Czech society. The 7 May issue of the 
Moravian daily ROVNOST quoted him as saying: "After completing 
most of its reorganization, the Army is now entering the stage 
of routine buildup and improvement." Klaus added, however, that 
the Army still needs to "reduce rather than add weight."

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] Several recent Czech periodical articles 
have provided information on developments in the Czech defense 
industry. 
<H5>  New Military Jet </H5>
  Victor Kucera, research and development director of the 
Czech 
aircraft manufacturer Aero Vodochody, provided details on his 
company's new L-159 multipurpose light combat aircraft in an 
interview published in the 19 April issue of the military 
journal A REPORT. Kucera said that the L-159 will come in one- 
and two-seat versions, both with good fuel economy, advanced 
avionics, and the capability of operating over chemically 
contaminated terrain. The L-159 prototype is slated for 
production in 1996, and the aircraft is scheduled to be 
available for delivery by the end of 1998. The initial 
manufacturing run is estimated to be about 100 aircraft, most of 
which will be acquired by the Czech Air Force. The plane will 
meet international criteria, including NATO compatibility, and 
will be available for export. Its maintenance and operational 
procedures, weapon systems, and ammunition will correspond fully 
to Western standards. 
  Kucera noted that the L-159 is a substantial upgrade of Aero 
Vodochody's proven L-59 series. Even though the L-159 will 
reach a maximum speed of only Mach 0.82, due to construction 
techniques and a wing design that facilitate cheap and rapid 
production, the new plane, according to Kucera, should perform 
better than the MiG-21 and the MiG-23. The L-159 will not be 
very well suited to dogfights, but it will have strong defensive 
capabilities, including multipurpose radar and the most modern 
passive and active defense protection available. Kucera 
described the L-159 as being very similar to the British HAWK 
aircraft. He said that four L-159's will cost no more than one 
U.S. F-16. 
<H5>  Defense Procurement Contracts </H5>
  The efforts of the Czech armed forces to modernize and 
achieve NATO compatibility have led the Czech Defense Ministry 
to seek bids by suppliers of various types of military hardware. 
According to the 19 May issue of the Prague daily LIDOVE 
NOVINY, approximately 40 companies are currently competing for 
contracts. Requests for proposals have been issued for an 
all-terrain vehicle (for which Mercedes is competing with the 
U.S. Jeep Corporation and Prague-based Avia), a new combat 
aircraft (for which the Czech company Aero Vodochody is 
developing a prototype), guided missiles (for which the French 
firm Matra is seen as the primary bidder), infantry weapons 
(pitting the Czech Arms Plants [Ceska Zbrojovka] against the 
Swiss firm SIG), tractors (which may be obtained from Tatra), 
and communications systems (which Italy's Marconi and Germany's 
Dornier would like to provide). 
  LIDOVE NOVINY notes that the big sums involved in 
large-scale 
defense procurement have raised the issue of potential bribery. 
The paper writes that, while some Defense ministry officials 
dismiss this possibility, other ministry employees claim that 
the first signs have already appeared in the form of expensive 
restaurant-bill payments by representatives of defense 
contractors. The new chief of Army logistics, Frantisek Veprek, 
told LIDOVE NOVINY that even such behavior by procurement 
officials is unacceptable. As an example of measures that have 
been taken to forestall bribery attempts, Veprek pointed to the 
division of labor among three offices that work on contract 
bids: one prepares contracts for bids, another evaluates bids, 
and a third approves proposals. 
<H5>  Foreign Training Approved </H5>
  The Czech parliament has approved a government proposal that 
would allow Czech Army units to be sent to foreign countries for 
training and, conversely, allow foreign military units to train 
with the Czech armed forces in the Czech Republic, according to 
the 30 April RUDE PRAVO. The liaison training will be limited 
to 30 days and 700 troops for Czech units traveling to foreign 
countries, and foreign units in the Czech Republic are to be 
limited to a stay of 21 days and are not to exceed 5,000 troops 
at any one time. 
<H5>  New Generals </H5>
  SVOBODNE SLOVO of 9 May reported that President Vaclav Havel 
has promoted three Army officers to the rank of general. 
Ladislav Kozler, chief of the Defense Ministry Foreign 
Relations Department, and Josef Dufek, commander of the 4th Air 
Defense Corps, were named major generals, while Colonel 
Rostislav til, the commander of Czech troops detailed to the UN 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia, was given 
the brevet rank of major general for the duration of his service 
with UNPROFOR.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by </F>
unidentified program announcer; relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia 
Network in Polish--live] 
  [Text] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Just as it did 
a week ago, today's "Bilans" program is going out live. Our 
guest then was Professor Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister 
and minister of finance. Today, on the other hand, we have 
Waldemar Pawlak, chairman of the Council of Ministers, in the 
studio. 
  Almost nine months have passed since Prime Minister Pawlak's 
cabinet was formed. We are now in the middle of 1994, and it is 
therefore time for a summing up. We would like to do this on 
the basis of two documents. The first is the prime minister's 
report, given on 8 November of last year. The second is the 
"Strategy for Poland," the government's program up to 1997. 
  Prime Minister, let us recall your Sejm report. You stated 
then that the struggle with unemployment is among the 
government's highest priority tasks. Unemployment has fallen 
but only insignificantly, and the prospects are not too 
encouraging because it is estimated in the "Strategy for Poland" 
that, in three years' time, more than 2.5 million Poles will be 
without work. 
  [Pawlak] Indeed, unemployment is a very serious social 
problem, a problem for the entire state. I think that not all 
of us are aware of the scale of this problem. We have a 
situation where, if we take all of those who do not have work 
and those who take retirement and annuity payments, and, on the 
other hand, those who do work, we get proportions that are in 
practice one to one. So, this shows how difficult it is to 
actively overcome this very troublesome phenomenon. 
  I would like to very clearly stress that the problem of 
unemployment and of reducing the scale of unemployment, reducing 
the number of unemployed, has two very important aspects. On 
the one hand, the creation of new jobs and the reduction of that 
number of unemployed and, on the other, the need for the labor 
market to absorb young people who have finished their schooling. 
And it must be said that, over these three years, Poland's 
population will increase by about 600,000 people. And so, 
limiting unemployment does not only mean reducing this number, 
but also absorbing this population growth. That is, around 1.5 
million new jobs must be created by the year 2001 so that 
unemployment does not grow. And this shows what a serious 
phenomenon this is. 
  [Announcer] So, we must come to terms with the fact that, 
nevertheless, 2.5 million Poles will be without employment in 
the year 1997? 
  [Pawlak] I think that if things go well, if economic 
processes run well, this scale of unemployment may be smaller. 
As you know, from the point of view of these processes that we 
are having to deal with, this is quite difficult because, on the 
one hand, we have the stabilization of the national economy, the 
limitation of these economic factors, and of inflation in 
particular, and, on the other, the need for the creation of 
jobs. And we wish to draw attention, along this road, to the 
investment-friendly character of our program, to the creation of 
new jobs, the close association of modernization programs with 
the local situation on the labor markets. 
  An active approach to issues of unemployment is very 
important, as is the promotion of industries and activities that 
will absorb a large amount of labor. We need not immediately 
take the most modern technologies in every area. It is worth 
recalling here an old anecdote of [Henry] Ford's, who, when 
asked whether he was a supporter or an opponent of automation, 
said that he was an opponent because a robot would not buy a car 
from him. And I think it is worth remembering this. 
  [Announcer] Prime Minister, unemployment is also associated 
with the countryside and with agriculture. I will quote two 
figures: 27 percent of the professionally active [population] 
produces 7 percent of the gross national product or of the 
national income, let us say. It is clear that this relationship 
must change. What proposal do you have, not so much for 
agriculture as for the countryside? The countryside, as is well 
known, suffers from underinvestment. It stands civilizationally 
much below the cities. There is quite simply an awful lot of 
work to do there. 
  [Pawlak] Our approach to the issues of the countryside is 
significantly broader than merely the problems of agriculture 
and employment in agriculture. And this is how these matters 
are conceived by one of the key programs of the "Strategy for 
Poland," the very title of which indicates the essence of this 
approach. The point is the development of rural areas. 
  [Announcer] But Prime Minister, at the same time--I am sorry 
to interrupt--but, at the same time, the Strategy [for Poland] 
includes the clause that the amount of cheap credit for 
agriculture will be significantly, must be, successively 
limited, while cheap credits for agriculture were the basis of 
the Polish Peasant Party's election campaign. 
  [Pawlak] Not only theirs. 
  [Announcer] Among others. 
  [Pawlak] Well, all right. This is.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] [words indistinct] 
  [Pawlak] Let me just say a little. I wish to show that our 
concern is that we look at the countryside not just as 
agriculture but, above all, as the place where 38 percent of the 
population of Poland lives and where people work in many and 
various spheres: in the agricultural infrastructure, in 
[agricultural] processing, in services and trade. And we draw 
attention to the renewal of the countryside and the 
multifunctional development of the countryside as this basic 
goal, in order to create realistic possibilities for the 
attainment of incomes alongside [those from] agriculture. This 
is so that we can look to the future and not to the past and 
what took place in other countries tens of years ago. 
Development of the infrastructure--telephones, water mains, 
roads, gas--is very important. This conditions the possibility 
of the creation of many modern enterprises. Already today we 
have very specific examples. There is a very modern (?syringe) 
factory near Lomza, computers are produced near Nowy Sacz. 
There are often specific, local opportunities that people are 
capable of exploiting marvellously. An example that I recently 
had the opportunity to familiarize myself with very closely, as 
well as with the evolution of the [associated] milieu, is 
Swarzedz [in western Poland], which is showing itself capable of 
very ambitiously and quickly adapting this local specificity to 
the current needs of the market. These examples demonstrate that 
the countryside must be treated differently, and, from the point 
of view of the prospects for development in other countries, as 
well, the developing countries, where there is a trend toward 
returning to living outside the great urban agglomerations. 
  I do not think this present situation is a burden for us but 
a chance--that is, if we can make use of it. 
  [Announcer] Summing up, Mr. Prime Minister, let us us talk 
about agriculture for a moment. Will Polish agriculture become 
relatively competitive with, for example, West European 
agriculture, before the end of the century? 
  [Pawlak] It is already competitive, and Europe is very much 
afraid of our agriculture. For example, there are certain 
actions that hinder the availability of our agricultural 
products, especially fruit and vegetables, on European markets. 
  [Announcer] But, Mr. Prime Minister, we have also introduced 
a surtax. 
  [Pawlak] Yes, but you know well that the European Union has 
had such charges for decades. So, we are not always following 
with our solutions in such a way that we end up with comparable 
tools for such comparable competition, giving our producers the 
same chances. [sentence as heard] 
  Recently, yesterday I think, the Council of Ministers' 
economic committee discussed a program for the development of 
agriculture up to the year 2000. And this is, as it were, 
another level for those programmatic proposals we have been 
putting forward. A strategy is a general program showing 
general directions. On the other hand, the Agriculture Ministry 
has already put forward detailed solutions concerning that part 
of the economy. 
  [Announcer] Mr. Prime Minister, I know that agriculture and 
rural affairs are very close to your heart, but let us talk 
about the "Strategy for Poland." There are certain basic 
indicators that are very optimistic. For example, the growth of 
the GNP by over 20 percent, a fall in inflation in 1997 to 9 
percent, are forecast there. At the same time, there is talk of 
reducing taxes, about increases in subsidies for culture, 
education, health. Do you not think that such an excess of 
these just objectives is at variance with the realities? In 
other words, is the "Strategy for Poland" a realistic program? 
  [Pawlak] I think it is very much a realistic program. The 
structure of this program is a directional one, showing the main 
objectives, conditions, main objectives, resources, threats, and 
implementation criteria. And we wish to discuss these 
objectives thoroughly with various groups so that there is 
agreement as far as the aims are concerned. And, as far as 
resources are concerned, we have to be very flexible under the 
circumstances and life force of our flexible approach, so that 
these aims can be within reach. It is also important that we 
know the major threats because then we can effectively reach our 
objectives, on the other hand.... 
  [Announcer, interrupting] Such as, for example, the lack of 
social peace and strikes, Mr. Prime Minister? 
  [Pawlak continues] On the other hand, implementation 
criteria 
are also included there, which allow us to assess whether and 
how fast we are approaching these objectives. 
  [Announcer] But aren't you afraid that that very lack of 
social peace, the strikes we have at present, will make it 
impossible to implement the program? And the second matter, the 
issue of strikes. You said yesterday that the latest strikes in 
the steel industry were being inspired from the outside. Please 
excuse me, but this reminds me of rhetoric from the past. 
  [Pawlak] Oh no, no. This is an old trick that can still be 
found in today's "Wiadomosci" [television newscast], that this 
is not information but interpretation. I did not say it, and 
this can be easily checked. It was just a coincidence that 
problems with the sale of steel on European markets happened at 
the same time as strikes in our steel industry, and this is 
where we are scoring an own goal, I am sure. This is 
irrespective of intentions and is unequivocal because, in such a 
situation, we are losing out to the competition. 
  [Announcer] We are into the last 40 seconds. And [there is] 
a very important issue, the issue of local government. This 
area is the most criticized. 
  [Pawlak] I wish to stress very clearly that the government 
has decided on broad cooperation with and support for local 
government, and in such a way that the local governments will be 
able to effectively implement their tasks. The point here is, 
above all, not to centrally transfer responsibility to local 
governments without the resources that will later safeguard the 
correct implementation of these tasks. We have had such a 
phenomenon in the case of education, and we have put the case 
very clearly. Those parishes [gminy] that make the decisions, 
that adopt resolutions, can take over schools. If the country's 
situation improves, I think it will be possible to much more 
easily and effectively pass on an ever wider range of tasks to 
the local governments, together with the resources for this. 
What happens when these tasks are entrusted without resources 
can be seen from the example of, for instance, the handover of 
certain tasks in the communal economy, the generation of 
thermal-energy, for instance. 
  And I think there is one more issue associated with these 
structural transformations. 
  [Announcer, interrupting] We must end. 
  [Pawlak] This is just one sentence. The point is that it is 
often said that we again need a district [powiat] level of 
administration. I do not think that, for the time being, we are 
in so hopeless a situation as to have to reach for a third 
layer--that is, to carry out a reorganization. It is worth 
considering the exploitation of the potential that exists 
already--for instance, the handover of wider entitlements, 
especially in the sphere of voivodship budgets for voivodship 
local assemblies [sejmiki], so that they, together with the 
voivoda, are able to create significantly better solutions and 
economically exploit those opportunities that are available at 
the local level, at the voivodship level. 
  [Announcer] Thank you very much, Prime Minister. We have run 
out of time.

<F P=106> [Article by Mikel Ndreca: "Anti-Kosovar Provocation"] </F>
  [Text] The Belgrade mass media reported a few days ago the 
appointment of Zivorad Igic as ambassador of Yugoslavia (!) to 
Albania. BUJKU rightly deplored this news. 
  As is well known, after the disintegration of AVNOJ 
[Antifascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia] 
Yugoslavia, many states of Europe and the United States withdrew 
their ambassadors from Belgrade, at the same time requesting the 
withdrawal of the Yugoslav ambassadors from their countries. 
Respecting this stand by other countries, the Republic of 
Albania acted likewise by withdrawing its ambassador from 
Belgrade and asking for the withdrawal of the Yugoslav 
ambassador in Tirana. 
  A few days ago, the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] 
Government issued a request for the revival of talks with the 
democratic Republic of Albania at foreign-ministerial level. We 
have not been informed of the response of the Albanian side. 
  How these possible talks will develop is not the concern of 
this article. What interests the Kosovar Albanian public today 
is the appointment of Zivorad Igic as ambassador to Tirana. 
  If the governments of the FRY and Serbia really do have a 
sincere intention to renew relations of any kind with the 
Republic of Albania, they must also think about the choice of 
the person who will contribute toward promoting these relations. 
Zivorad Igic is not such a man. His appointment to this 
high-level diplomatic post in a country with whom relations have 
cooled for well-known reasons has been taken as a serious 
provocation by the Albanian people of Kosova. We do not believe 
that the state and political authorities in Yugoslavia and 
Serbia are unaware of this. And this is why.... 
  Zivorad Igic, once a village schoolteacher (nothing wrong in 
that) grew up almost in the Albanians' lap. He was 
"distinguished" as an "ardent" supporter of the idea of 
"brotherhood-and-unity and togetherness." From being a 
journalist and media editor, at the end of Yugosiavia's 
existence he "jumped" to the post of the (final) chairman of the 
Kosova Socialist Alliance [SAWP]. After purging this 
organization of Albanians at an early stage, he at the same time 
sought the most drastic and brutal state measures against them. 
  After the final destruction of the League of Communists 
[LCY] 
and the SAWP, Igic joined the Socialist Party of Serbia [SPS] 
and assumed high office. In the first pluralist parliamentary 
elections (in which the Albanians did not take place for 
well-known reasons), he was elected a deputy to the Serbian 
Assembly. 
  After the events of 1981, Zivorad Igic had slowly, but 
systematically and in the most perfidious fashion, following the 
"LCY line," involved himself in the anti-Albanian campaign. 
Following the outbreak of the anti-Albanian national-chauvinist 
popular hysteria and especially after 1987, Zivorad Igic devoted 
himself heart and soul to this campaign. In his articles in 
several Yugoslav newspapers, his appearance on LCY, SAWP, and 
other political rostrums, on the floor of the parliaments of 
Serbia and self-styled Yugoslavia, Zivorad Igic, more than 
anyone else from Kosova, lied, slandered, and spat out 
chauvinist gall against the Albanian people, accusing them of 
treason, of destroying Yugoslavia, and of allegedly visiting 
"violence," "terror," and "genocide" on the Serbian people in 
Kosova and beyond for more than a century. In these articles 
and speeches, Zivorad Igic insistently demanded the abolition of 
Kosova's autonomy, the suspension of all its educational, 
cultural, academic, health, and even economic institutions, and 
the total destruction of the Kosova economy and its subjection 
to that of serbia. The total destruction of all these 
institutions and of the Kosova economy is the indisputable 
"contribution" of Zivorad Igic, who, as a deputy of the Serbian 
parliament, voted for all the necessary measures. 
  Zivorad Igic, a Kosova-born Serbian intellectual, not only 
failed to raise the voice of reason against the most brutal 
violence, terror, and genocide on the continent of Europe, 
visited upon the Albanian people in Kosova by the present 
Serbian regime, but, in his articles, appearances, and behavior 
in the service of this regime, has powerfully aided 
anti-Albanian policies, showing himself to be a sworn enemy of 
the Albanian people. Finally, one must mention another matter 
of principle of which the FRY Government is aware, but which it 
ignores as something "nonexistent." It is well known that the 
Republic of Albania has accepted the Republic of Kosova. The 
choice of the Albanians of Kosova is well known both to 
Yugoslavia today and the world. Despite the efforts of the 
Yugoslav and Serbian Government to treat the Kosova issue as a 
Serbian internal affair, this issue has become 
internationalized, and the Albanians have no intention of 
accepting a solution without the presence and guarantee of an 
international factor. Zivorad Igic's appointment as the FRY's 
representative in Tirana, or anywhere else, at this phase of 
tense Albanian-Serbian (and Yugoslav) relations, cannot be 
understood by the Albanians as anything other than an 
intentional provocation. Sensible policies would not permit 
such a thing. The Albanians of Kosova are vitally interested in 
good, friendly, and sincere Albanian-Yugoslav relations, but 
they can only come about after the question of Kosova is 
conclusively solved. The appointment of the FRY ambassador from 
Kosova suggests that the FRY Government wishes to quietly sweep 
under the carpet Kosova as a free and independent entity, while 
the Republic of Albania will be left "holding the baby," 
because, if it fails to accept this ambassador from Kosova, it 
will be accused of "destabilizing" the situation in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Article by Anna Dano: "The New Government Is Almost Ready"] </F>
  [Text] After the agreement on political guarantees, 
personnel issues have also appeared on the agenda of the 
coalition talks. According to our information, contrary to 
previous promises, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will 
only receive four ministerial positions: The Interior Ministry, 
the Cultural Ministry, and the newly established ministry in 
charge of issues of infrastructure seem to be certain; 
negotiations are still going on regarding the Justice Ministry. 
The political state secretaries will probably emerge from the 
party that provides the minister too, but the other party can 
nominate the chairmen of parliamentary committees. Alajos 
Dornbach will probably be the chairman of the Parliament. 
  After agreeing on the political guarantees of the future 
coalition, the issue of distributing the ministerial positions, 
including the personnel decisions, can no longer be delayed. 
Although after winning the elections, the Socialists said that, 
as a gesture toward their coalition partners, they will not 
divide up the ministries according to the number of mandates but 
will give 40 percent of them to the liberals (at least five 
ministries), no one mentions this anymore. According to our 
latest information, the SZDSZ can count on four ministerial 
positions at most, and only one of them is a really strong 
position. 
  The fact that Gyula Horn will be the prime minister has been 
clear for quite some time. After the leading players of 
international politics and the big capital recognized the 
victory of the chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
with a spectacular gesture, the SZDSZ is forced to forget about 
Balint Magyar's statement that there will be no coalition under 
Gyula Horn's premiership, a statement confirmed by the executive 
body. This, as well as the position that it would be a mistake 
to restore the institution of minister without portfolio, 
something that would also require the modification of the 
Constitution, designed the place of Gabor Kuncze, who was 
professionally "sold" in the course of the campaign, as head of 
the Interior Ministry. The only problem here is that Gabor 
Kuncze is an economist, and not a legal expert. 
  The fate of the head of the Foreign Ministry is also most 
probably decided. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, the travelling 
ambassador of the liberals, could not even be considered, so 
this position will most probably go to Laszlo Kovacs, the former 
MSZP head of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee. 
  According to the rumors, Laszlo Bekesi will become the head 
of the Finance Ministry. This shows some contradiction, because 
if the Bekesi-program is the basis of the common government 
program, then Bekesi should lead the economic top ministry. And 
the Finance Ministry can hardly be this top ministry if, along 
with it, a centralized ministry will deal with the economy, a 
top ministry that will incorporate the current Industry 
Ministry, the Ministry of International Economic Relations, and 
the National Technological Development Committee. The 
privatization issue could also be incorporated here, namely the 
National Property Agency. 
  The debate is still going on on whether to also incorporate 
the Treasury Property Management Organization into all this. 
The MSZP supports the idea, but the SZDSZ opposes it. There is 
not yet a sure candidate for this mammoth ministry but, 
according to our information, the MSZP would prefer Laszlo Pal 
in this position, but he still lacks the support of the liberals. 
  The Justice Ministry is the other critical point. The SZDSZ 
candidate is Peter Hack, but the MSZP would also like to see 
their own man in this position, and Pal Vastagh is the person 
considered for this position. According to the current state of 
affairs, the MSZP seems to win the debate. The fate of this 
ministry can be important, all the more so because both parties 
came up with the proposal to eliminate the position of minister 
without portfolio in charge of the intelligence services. In 
that case, the civil intelligence services could only get under 
the control of the Interior Ministry or the Justice Ministry. 
However, the former could bring bad memories because of the 
Danube-gate scandal. If the Justice Ministry gets it, the 
person who gets this will obtain two ministry seats 
simultaneously. It is true that MSZP Deputy Chairman Ferenc 
Baja has also been considered for supervising the Intelligence 
Services, but the SZDSZ does not support his nomination. 
SZDSZ's Andrea Szolnoki ran for the position of welfare 
minister, but it is almost a fact that MSZP's Pal Kovacs will 
get this position. The idea of transferring social policy 
issues from the Welfare Ministry to the Labor Affairs Ministry 
seems to be fizzling away. Mrs. Kosa Magda Kovacs is the 
plausible candidate to head the Labor Affairs Ministry. 
  There is full understanding regarding the Culture Ministry: 
Both parties support the nomination of Gabor Fodor, who changed 
places from the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] to the 
SZDSZ. 
  The position of MSZP's Laszlo Lakos as head of the 
Agricultural Ministry seems to be similarly sure. 
  There is not yet any agreement on the fate of the Defense 
Ministry. It will probably also remain under the control of the 
MSZP. Gyorgy Keleti has repeatedly been mentioned as a possible 
candidate. The same applies to the issue of environmental 
protection. 
  The parties also discussed establishing two new ministries. 
One would be in charge of issues connected with European 
integration; the other would deal with matters of infrastructure 
(transport, urban development, investments, the world expo). 
The latter should go to the liberals, but there is not yet a 
concrete candidate. 
  The MSZP is also urging the establishment of a third 
ministry, or more precisely a position of minister without 
portfolio. This would deal with national minority issues. 
Their candidate is Csaba Tabajdi, but the SZDSZ supports 
neither the position nor the candidate. 
  The delegations have already agreed that the head of every 
ministry can also bring the political state secretary with him. 
To counterbalance the expected two-thirds MSZP advantage, Gyula 
Horn and his party offered the position of head of the relevant 
parliamentary committee to the representative of the other 
party. There will also be some counterbalance if Alajos Dornbach 
receives the position of parliament chairman. 
  There is also agreement on the candidate for the National 
Bank chairman. Both parties would welcome Gyorgy Suranyi in 
this position.

  [Text] We have just learned that the negotiations between 
representatives of the Croatian authorities and the Serbs from 
the protected zones have been canceled due to the Serbs' refusal 
to allow representatives of Croatia's media to attend the talks. 
This is what international mediator Kai Aide said at a news 
conference which ended a few minutes ago at the UN Protection 
Forces headquarters in Zagreb. The international mediators will 
try to reach agreement on another date for these negotiations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
Christine Dupre in Prague; date not given: "The Coalition 
Endangered"] 
  [Text] The defeat in the Slovak parliament of the 
draft bill that would have allowed bilingual signs in 
communities with a strong Hungarian minority marks the first 
failure of the coalition government (comprising the Communist 
Renewal, center parties, and the Christian Democrats) led by 
Josef Moravcik since the overthrow of his predecessor, Vladimir 
Meciar, last March. This 49-year-old attorney will have 
difficulty in keeping his coalition together after the early 
elections of 30 September and 1 October 1994, let alone 
preventing the return of Meciar and the nationalists. But the 
Slovak prime minister refused to dramatize the situation during 
the interview he granted to LA LIBRE BELGIQUE. 
  [Moravcik] It is true that the rejection of the bill can be 
interpreted as a failure. But I believe that today we are 
nonetheless closer to conforming with the Council of Europe 
recommendations: Both the majority and the opposition agree on 
the principle of bilingual signs in communities in which 
linguistic minorities represent at least 20 percent of the 
population. The differences in opinion relate to the names that 
should appear alongside the official Slovak names. But there is 
really only a very little way to go to obtain a consensus. This 
is a technical question, and I am convinced that we will succeed 
in mastering it. 
  [Dupre] Does this not also prove that Vladimir Meciar 
remains 
very strong? He is already campaigning in the villages in which 
the election may possibly be played out. 
  [Moravcik] The polls are in fact pointing to a fall in 
popularity of Meciar and his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), with right now some 20 percent of prospective votes. I 
hope that we will succeed in convincing the electorate that 
there is another way of exercising power than the one used by 
Meciar. The economic measures that the IMF recommended to limit 
our budget deficit to 4 percent of the GDP, the VAT [value-added 
tax] raising to 25 percent on 10 percent of goods and services, 
and the fall in farm subsidies will not make our task any 
easier, but we have no choice. On the other hand, we are 
looking to revive the building industry through privatization 
money: The programs we will be launching in the regions will 
play a very important role here. 
  [Dupre] Will Slovakia be staking its future and its 
attachment to Europe on these elections? 
  [Moravcik] I do not believe these parliamentary elections 
are 
going to substantially alter the political scene. The present 
coalition has a chance of remaining in power, but its fate is, 
to a large extent, in the hands of the Party of the Democratic 
Left (the SDL or Communist Renewal, the leading party in 
government). If it maintains its image as a modern, Western, 
and European party, everything will go well (editor's note: the 
SDL base is at times suspected of preferring an alliance with 
Vladimir Meciar). Taking a long-term approach, it is to be 
hoped that the other political formations will succeed in 
sidelining the HZDS, treating it as an extremist party. If 
Meciar's party were to obtain a better-than-expected result, 
Slovakia would be slowed down on the path it has mapped out, but 
I do not believe its fundamental directions would be called into 
question. 
  [Dupre] How do you react on hearing Czech Prime Minister 
Vaclav Klaus questioning the legitimacy of the government you 
head up and refusing to meet you? Does this represent indirect 
support of Meciar? 
  [Moravcik] Mr. Klaus has two main character traits: his 
conservatism and his caution. He is waiting. An attitude that 
pretty much resembles that of West European countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadja Pengov on the session of the parliamentary </F>
Foreign Affairs Commission in Ljubljana on 15 June] 
  [Text] In the closed part of the session, the 
parliamentary Foreign Affairs Commission discussed Italy's 
behavior toward our country regarding our integration in the 
European Union, the visit of the president of the state to 
Zagreb -- President Kucan briefed the members of the 
parliamentary commission himself -- and a report by the 
Commission's three-member working group for borders that visited 
some villages yesterday. The report concerns four villages on 
the other side of the Dragonja River and on the other side of 
the border crossings with Croatia where, in the past, the 
authorities of Piran and Buje communes used to intersect. The 
majority of the villagers there believe that they belong to 
Slovenia. The working group is of the same opinion. The 
Commission proposed that Slovenia does everything necessary to 
keep the villages in our country. 
  Regarding the visit of President Kucan to Croatia, during 
which he held talks with President Tudjman and Prime Minister 
Valentic -- as the Commission emphasized, a visit that again 
passed in the absence of our foreign minister -- the members 
were of the opinion that it is high time for the countries to 
finally start discussing numerous problems that are burdening 
relations. The agreement about this, as [the head of the 
Foreign Affairs' Commission] Zoran Thaler said, could be reached 
during preparations for the July visit of Prime Minister 
Valentic in Ljubljana. 
  Now about the third topic, which was discussed in the part 
of 
the session closed to the public -- Italy's attitude toward our 
country and the measures to slow us down in drawing closer to 
the European Union. 
  [Begin Thaler recording] The essential question that we 
asked ourselves is: What are the actual interests of Italy? Is 
what the Italian Foreign Minister -- who likes to say that these 
are minor problems that are already being resolved and that, 
after their resolution, Italy will gladly support Slovenia's 
membership in the European Union -- is saying also true, and is 
the agreement about these so-called minor issues truly 
sufficient for Italy to change its policy toward Slovenia? 
  Our logic is quite the opposite and, we believe, also more 
rational. We believe that the interests of Italy would be much 
better served if Italy was the one to encourage and, in a way, 
push Slovenia closer to the European Union. [end recording] 
  The Commission proposed that the government intensify its 
contacts with the 11 EU members and the arguments for the 
resolution of the position of the Slovene minority in Italy, 
which has recently deteriorated again. As Thaler assured, 
Slovenia will prepare a detailed dossier about the results of 
the Fascist repression upon the Slovenes between the years 1918 
to 1941 and will inform the European public of the findings. In 
this way, the second side of the medal to the questions and 
demands regarding property of the former refugees will also be 
known. 
  It will also become clear that the raising of the issues 
regulated with the Osimo Agreements could have further 
consequences for the European territory and that this is not 
merely a matter of Slovene-Italian relations. The Commission is 
of the opinion, Thaler emphasized, that the agreements between 
Italy and Slovenia are internationally and legally valid. Any 
possible new questions should be resolved to mutual satisfaction 
and not through blackmail.

  [Text] Belgrade, 17 Jun (TANJUG) -- Republic of Srpska 
president Radovan Karadzic told VECERNJE NOVOSTI (Belgrade 
daily) today that the River Drina could never again become a 
border between the Serbs (in Bosnia and Serbia), and that the 
Muslims could only be given enclaves in eastern Bosnia. In an 
interview given in Moscow after his talks with Russian 
officials, Karadzic pointed out that he had asked Andrey Kozyrev 
and his aides to tell the contact group that the Serbs had to 
have their part of Sarajevo. According to Karadzic, the central 
part of Sarajevo, except for Grbavica, will be given to the 
Muslims, and the republic of Srpska should get Dobrinja, Ilidza, 
Lukavica, Hrasnica, and Rajlovac (western districts of Sarajevo). 
  "We will not give up the right bank of the Una river under 
any circumstances, and there can be no haggling over Sanski 
Most, our part of (Bosanska) Krupa, Novi Grad (former Bosanski 
Novi), and Prijedor (all Serb-held towns in western Bosnia), or 
over Podgrmecje and Potkozarje (areas in western Bosnia)," 
Karadzic said. 
  Karadzic told the Russians to convey to the contact group 
that the Sava river would be the best and the only possible 
natural border in Posavina (Northern Bosnia). He said that the 
republic of Srpska is very interested in a 1- or 2-km widening 
(of the corridor) near Brcko and stressed the readiness to allow 
the Muslims to use part of the Brcko port, but any interruption 
of the republic of Srpska's territorial integrity is out of the 
question. Karadzic pointed out that Croatia is offered an 
honorable (Serb) proposal to get 250 square km in the Dubrovnik 
hinterland in exchange for 30-35 km of the coast, between a 
point north of Molunat and Prevlaka. 
  Saying that very soon it will become clear whether or not 
the 
United States is trying to involve Serbia and the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia in the war, Karadzic specified that 
United States' insistence on a peace plan and maps dividing 
Bosnia, which will be unacceptable for the Serbs, would be a 
clear indication of this.

<F P=106> [Interview with FRY Defense Minister Pavle Bulatovic by </F>
Radoljub Matovic and Milorad Pantelic; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "We are successful in developing the defense system 
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, although the 
circumstances in the country and its neighborhood are very 
complicated. Defense and safety are two vital functions in the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which has decided to establish 
and organize a professional, powerful, well-equipped, and 
efficient military force. In other words, we would like to 
develop a military force that will be able to avert an 
aggression against our country and that is capable of defending 
our territorial integrity, freedom, and independence in case of 
an aggression," Pavle Bulatovic, the federal defense minister, 
said in his first interview for VOJSKA. 
  [VOJSKA] To what extent is the defense concept being 
manifested? 
  [Bulatovic] It is clear that a military force and a defense 
system in general depend on the financial possibilities of the 
country, but also, vice versa, the power of a country depends on 
the capabilities of its military force, which should defend it, 
thus enabling it to prosper in freedom. 
  The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 
unified its defense system, and this concept is being 
consistently materialized in the republics of our federation. 
In other words, the republican defense ministries have 
practically been abolished and the Federal Ministry constituted. 
Defense is a portfolio in the Federal Government. There are 
problems with the materialization of our defense concept, but 
they cannot affect the defense system as defined by the 
Constitution. 
  It is clear that the federal state had to define what kind 
of 
a military force it wanted and how big it should be, and it did 
so. We have to bear in mind that a powerful military force is 
the aim we want to achieve. This aim cannot be achieved 
overnight. Especially not because we are trying to develop our 
army under the conditions of a war and economic sanctions, which 
means with very little financial means. The Federal Government 
and the Federal Defense Ministry do not have any additional 
funds that would make it possible to speed up the organization 
of the army, so that the only approach, which must be applied 
consistently at all command levels, is to be rational and set 
priorities. 
  Our multiparty system requires us to reach a consensus in 
all 
important issues, especially in the field of national defense. 
This must be binding for all parties, regardless of their 
political programs. Conflicts between political parties must 
not affect the defense system. 
  [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army must not be accused of the 
disintegration of Yugoslavia any longer. 
  [Bulatovic] The question of who caused the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia is very complex. Nobody has treated this issue 
seriously yet. This is necessary, though. It is more than 
obvious that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [SFRY] 
was a fragile structure since it collapsed at the first 
nationalist attacks and influences from abroad. 
  The former Yugoslav People's Army is unfoundedly accused of 
the disintegration of Yugoslavia. Seen from the point of view 
of history, the army has always defended freedom in this area, 
and politics has always chosen the state it wanted. In my 
opinion, the Yugoslav People's Army could have done only two 
things -- either to execute the orders given by its supreme 
command, the SFRY Presidency, or to stage a coup. The military 
leadership chose the correct solution; everything else is 
speculation since we cannot know whether Yugoslavia would have 
collapse also in the case of a coup, whether more or less blood 
would have been shed.... We must not allow wrong assessments 
made by individuals from the former Yugoslav People's Army to be 
ascribed to the Yugoslav Army. The phenomenon of treason has 
always been present in this area, but always as an act committed 
by an individual, not as collective hypocrisy. 
  [VOJSKA] The defense of Yugoslavia is a right and duty of 
all our citizens. Still, some do not want to fulfill this 
obligation. 
  [Bulatovic] This is a big and complex problem. It is 
necessary that the state is accepted and respected by all of its 
citizens if we want them to accept its defense as their duty. 
Unfortunately, there are still people who have not accepted the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as their state. Would the use of 
repressive measures mean that they accept our state, its 
leadership and policy, or will it only be the implementation of 
laws? It is not only necessary to find rational political 
solutions to controversial matters, but also to apply legal 
regulations. 
  There must be no quarrels about certain questions, 
especially 
about the territorial integrity of Serbia, Montenegro, and 
Yugoslavia in general. No negotiations are possible about this 
topic, neither in Yugoslavia, nor abroad, since this state is 
the result of historical processes and desperate struggles for 
freedom. Nobody has the right to argue about the blood shed in 
this area. 
  [VOJSKA] What is the destiny of peace in the Balkans, and 
who will, in your opinion, decide about it? 
  [Bulatovic] Major powers are following their interests and 
are creating the spheres of their interests in the Balkans. It 
is clear who does not want peace; the Serbs in Yugoslavia and in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina certainly do want it. 
  I would like to remind you that the aim of the aggressors in 
the two world wars was to exterminate the Serbian and the 
Montenegrin population, but they were not successful. What was 
not achieved then is beingdone in a much more perfidious way now 
-- by waging a low-intensity war against us, without spreading 
into war conflicts. The Serbian and Montenegrin people have to 
defend their freedom decisively, as they have done during the 
course of history. They have no other choice. 
  Many assessments have already been made, but I would like to 
remind you of the words uttered by Mr. Jovan Cvijic that the 
Serbs are guilty only because they built their house in the 
middle of the road. The house has to be defended because it is 
obviously an impediment to the interests of major powers. They 
do not want to allow us to live peacefully in our house. 
  [VOJSKA] The required high professionalism of the army 
collides with the modest financial means Yugoslavia can invest 
in it. What is done in order to find a solution to this 
contradiction? 
  [Bulatovic] There is really a striking discrepancy between 
our wishes and our financial power. This problem is often 
discussed at the Federal Defense Ministry and in sessions of the 
Supreme Defense Council. There is understanding in military 
commands and units that financial means are restricted and that 
priorities have to be set. By additional efforts of army 
members, it is possible to perform key tasks and keep the combat 
readiness of our defense system on the required level. The 
recovery of country's economy is encouraging, so we can hope 
that more means will be devoted to the defense system soon. 
  [VOJSKA] When will the organization of the Federal Defense 
Ministry be adopted? 
  [Bulatovic] We have not completed the organization of our 
Ministry yet. We are intensely working on it, however. There 
are still some questions that have to be solved. After that, we 
shall present the scheme of our organization to the Federal 
Government for adoption. This will happen soon. 
  [VOJSKA] The protection of civilians has been taken over by 
the Federal Defense Ministry, too. What problems accompany this 
procedure? 
  [Bulatovic] The tasks that had been performed by the 
republican ministries before the new Law on Defense was adopted 
were taken over by the Federal Defense Ministry at the end of 
last year. It was not a simple operation, since a completely new 
defense type had to be developed. We did not only take over 
these tasks from the republican ministries, we also employed 
their employees in charge of defense tasks. I can tell you that 
radical changes are foreseen in this field. There is a lot of 
work, but I believe that we shall be able to manage it. 
  [VOJSKA] You have stressed on several occasions that it is 
necessary to transform the military industry. What are the 
concrete measures you have proposed? 
  [Bulatovic] As you know, approximately 48 percent of capital 
assets of the former military industry have remained on the 
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Forty-six 
percent of the former employees have also remained. We have 
inherited almost all the scientists and researchers and other 
respectable personnel, as well as laboratory resources. 
  In cooperation with the Army of Yugoslavia General Staff, 
the 
Ministry has successfully organized the manufacturing process of 
priority weapons and military equipment. It is only natural 
that the present financial possibilities dictate our behavior in 
this extremely important field. 
  The Federal Defense Ministry will make use of its military 
industry facilities according to the criteria of economic 
feasibility. In other words, it will act according to market 
economic principles wherever this is possible. Since the market 
economy has been introduced, it is necessary to reorganize the 
military economy. The Yugoslav Army cannot invest in new 
facilities and technologies in order to develop complex combat 
and non-combat systems. It can only buy certain products from 
the "list" of the existing equipment in various units and 
commands. 
  One of the reasons we have not completed the process of 
military industry transformation is that the respective federal 
laws are late, too. The new law on companies will give the 
institutional framework for a more efficient organization and 
transformation of the military industry that will be adapted to 
the economic system of the country and to the needs of the 
Yugoslav Army. 
  [VOJSKA] Does this mean that the chances for a quicker 
technical modernization of the Yugoslav Army are getting better? 
  [Bulatovic] The Yugoslav Army must be equipped with modern 
and efficient weapons and technology. This is also the aim of 
the transformation, but we have to be aware of the reality of 
our military and political situation. 
  Technical modernization includes the introduction of 
efficient combat means, modern rocket systems and optoelectonic 
means, radio systems protected from surveillance, wiretapping, 
and disturbances, modern means for fire control etc. Our 
experts have assured us that the existing combat means can be 
modernized and developed. Certain complex means will have to be 
bought abroad. Research and development and manufacturing 
facilities will be adapted to the already adopted plans for 
technical modernization. 
  [VOJSKA] Let us go back to the difficult problem of 
finances.... 
  [Bulatovic] This is a really difficult question because we 
only have means to cover the most necessary things and it is 
difficult to set priorities under the present circumstances. We 
must not allow our basic defense functions to be affected, and, 
on the other hand, we must not allow young personnel to leave. 
In cooperation with the Federal Government and the Supreme 
Defense Council we shall do everything in order to prevent this. 
  [VOJSKA] One of your biggest problems is apartments for your 
employees.... 
  [Bulatovic] It is well known that there are 25,000 
applications for apartments that have to be solved, 17,500 of 
them were filed by people who have no apartment at all. So far 
we have succeeded in temporarily accommodating 3,000 Yugoslav 
Army members with 10,000 family members in military facilities. 
These people came to Yugoslavia from the breakaway republics. 
A radical change in the search for solutions in this field will 
not be possible without considerable financial help from 
society. Together with the General Staff, we have prepared a 
special program according to which 10,000 apartments should be 
built for the Yugoslav Army by the year 2000, but it is still 
not sure whether this will materialize or not. It is only 
certain that we shall have 2,000 apartments for our personnel 
next year. There are numerous other initiatives, but their 
materialization depends on funds. 
  [VOJSKA] The Yugoslav Army members who have not become 
Yugoslav citizens would like to know what their status is. 
  [Bulatovic] It has been precisely defined by the 
Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that the 
members of the Yugoslav Army can only be Yugoslav citizens. 
There is the same regulation everywhere in the world. The 
question of Yugoslav citizenship for those people will be solved 
according to the federal law on citizenship, which has to be 
adopted. I hope that the bill of law will soon enter the 
parliamentary procedure. 
  [VOJSKA] We are approaching 16 June -- the Day of the 
Yugoslav Army. The traditions of both the Serbian and the 
Montenegrin Armies are rich and long.... 
  [Bulatovic] Our peoples have always cherished the idea of 
freedom, we have always supported defense politics, politics of 
peace. We are powerful as far as our willpower and decisiveness 
are concerned. 
  June 16 was chosen as the Day of the Yugoslav Army, so that 
we are approaching its first anniversary. We must not assume, 
however, that history began on 16 June, or 27 April, or on some 
other day. We have to avoid mistakes that have been made since 
1945, because during this time it was almost degrading to 
mention Kajmakcalan, Cer, Mojkovac, Kolubara, Skadar, or army 
commanders Misic, Stepa, Putnik, Bojovic, Janko Vukotic, from 
whom we could have learned a lot, not only as far as tactics and 
strategy are concerned, but also as far as the relation toward 
soldiers and the state are concerned -- with adaptations to 
modern times, of course. Nor must we forget the experiences of 
World War II, especially from the resistance movement against 
Fascism. 
  I am convinced that commanders, soldiers, and other 
professional members of our army, as well as all those who are 
contributing to the development of our defense system, work 
toward a reliable defense system for the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia. 
  Finally, I would like to congratulate all Yugoslav Army 
members and the employees of the Federal Defense Ministry on the 
first Yugoslav Army anniversary. 
<H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5>
<H5>  Who Are Barbarians? </H5>
  Five hundred years ago we printed our first book in Obod, 
the 
"Oktoih." This was our contribution to world culture. Our 
first book is only a little younger than the United States, 
whose propaganda machine is now accusing us of being barbarians 
and monsters who should be wiped off the the face of the Earth 
for the benefit of humankind. 
  A nation exists, however, not only based on its biological 
existence, but also in the light of its contribution to 
civilization. 
  I would like to remind you of a dialogue between the army 
commander Drasko and the principal of the Republic of Venice in 
"Gorski vijenac," a work by P.P. Njegos that shows that 
accusations, but not by the Serbian and Montenegrin people, have 
a long tradition. 
  The principal is interested in the "Bosnjaci [population of 
historic Bosnia-Herzegovina] and Arbanasi [population of 
historic Albania]" and asks Drasko: "If they catch a 
Montenegrin, either dead or alive, will they eat him up, or what 
will they do with him?" 
  Drasko answers: "How would they eat him up, for God's sake, 
a man cannot eat a man!" 
  It is obvious who would like to change the roles now....

<F P=106> [CTK report: "The RDP Group Is Eager To Have the Czech Army </F>
as a Customer"] 
  [Text] Prague--The RDP Group consortium, associating 40 
arms enterprises, is interested in having the Czech Army as a 
customer. Viktorie Hradska, director general of the consortium, 
said this in an interview for CTK yesterday. 
  She believes that the statement that Defense Minister Baudys 
has no intention of dealing with the RDP Group is "rather 
exaggerated." Disputes that have arisen between the consortium 
and the Army, if any, should not be generalized, according to 
Hradska. 
  Baudys says in his statement that he has no intention of 
negotiating with the RDP the deliveries of military material to 
meet the needs of the Czech Army. The reason is the fact that 
the minister wants to directly address the manufacturers when 
making purchases. According to what he said, the Army does not 
need a mediator when concluding contracts. 
  Hradska is convinced that the existence of an organization 
of 
the RDP type, which would provide an umbrella for the given 
sphere of industry, is necessary. According to her, such 
company allows a rational arrangement and mutual interlinking of 
the production programs of the consortium members as regards 
research, development, and strategic planning, which would be 
too expensive for a single company. The RDP also should provide 
some guarantee that some of the Czech companies will not be 
swallowed by foreign industry, the director believes.

  [Text] Sofia, June 15 (BTA) -- Stressing once more 
Bulgaria's position of noninterference in the Yugo-conflict in 
any form whatsoever, Georgi Dimitrov, leader of the Bulgarian 
delegation to the 27th regular meeting of the Committee of 
Senior Officials of the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe in Prague, stated that Bulgaria was the most badly hit 
by the embargo on the former Yugoslavia, BTA learned from the 
Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
  Referring to the decisions of the CSCE Council of Foreign 
Ministers' meeting in Rome on "continuous control of the 
observance of CSCE standards and principles for human rights 
improvement and protection of minorities in Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro)," Mr. Dimitrov praised the results achieved by 
the meeting of representatives of the Bulgarian minority in 
eastern Serbia and officials of the embassies of the CSCE 
participating countries held at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade 
in May. The leader of the Bulgarian delegation insisted on 
ensuring the conditions which would enable the Bulgarian 
minority in Serbia exercise their legitimate rights and freedoms 
in full in compliance with the CSCE standards.

  [Text] Prague, June 15 (CTK) -- At their current session 
in Prague, the Committee of High Commissioners of the Conference 
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) today urged Latvia 
to re-evaluate its law on state citizenship adopted last week. 
The CSCE was asked to take a stance on the issue by the Russian 
Foreign Ministry. 
  The law, which sets hard conditions for acquiring Latvian 
citizenship, is a thorn in the flesh of the strong Russian 
minority living in the country. CSCE spokesman told journalists 
that the Latvian delegate to the Prague session, Ivars Pundurs, 
did not rule out that his government would make certain changes 
in the law. CSCE commissioners accepted this stance with 
satisfaction, the spokesman said.

  [Text] Tirana, June 14 (ATA) -- A delegation of the 
Republic of Montenegro arrived in Tirana on its way to the UK. 
The delegation is led by Premier Milo Djukanovic and composed 
of Deputy Premier Krunoslav Vukcevic and Foreign Minister 
Miodrag Lekic. 
  On the request of the Montenegrin part, the delegation was 
received in Durres by Premier Aleksander Meksi and Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi. Mr. Meksi pointed out the contacts and 
dialogue are important for the development of the relations 
between the two countries. This is a principle of the Albanian 
foreign policy also applied in the relations between Albania and 
Montenegro. The Albanian Government, said Mr. Meksi, holds that 
both sides should find possibilities for a cooperation in the 
future in fields of mutual interest. He also mentioned aspects 
of the regional situation, reiterating Albania's opinion on the 
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, on the issue of the Albanians in 
Kosova and the relations of Albania with neighbouring countries. 
  Mr. Djukanovic, Montenegrin premier, pointed out the 
readiness for cooperation between Montenegro and Albania, as 
neighbouring countries with common interests. He also spoke 
about the Balkan situation, laying the stress in the development 
of the dialogue between the two parties.

Agriculture and Food reported through a press release that the 
talks between the Albanian and Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Ministry of Agriculture 
delegations were characterized by a spirit of understanding and 
respect of the mutual interests. 
  The two sides agreed on all the questions they discussed 
concerning the problems of the mutual interest. The Albanian 
party insisted that the documents to be signed should refer to 
Macedonia with the name that the United Nations has given to 
this republic since Albania too has recognized its eastern 
neighbour by this name. The press release said that there was 
no personal approach on this question. 
  The minister of agriculture and food, Hasan Halili, who 
headed the delegation, clarified that the stand of the 
delegation was in conformity with that of the Albanian 
Government on this issue. The press release informs the public 
that issues about which the two delegations talked will be 
reflected in a protocol which is expected to be signed soon.

  [Text] Sofia, June 14 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
is likely to nominate a replacement this week for Deputy Prime 
Minister and Trade Minister Valentin Karabashev, who has 
resigned, Socialist leader Zhan Videnov told a regular briefing 
today. It became clear that with this absolutely necessary 
change the cabinet will work until the elections. According to 
Videnov, the personnel and structural changes demanded from the 
prime minister by the Socialists in return for support for the 
cabinet would have made sense only if they had rallied the 
parliamentary majority to support the cabinet. Since this did 
not materialize and Bulgaria is heading for elections in the 
autumn, structural and personnel changes became rather 
pointless, Videnov said. 
  Prime Minister Lyuben Berov yesterday submitted a proposal 
to 
parliament to relieve Karabashev of his post and appoint Kiril 
Tsochev in his place, it was announced later on. The Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) will not demand changes other than those 
already proposed, Videnov said after a meeting of the BSP 
parliamentary group this afternoon. According to him, the 
Socialists will not object to Tsochev's appointment as deputy 
prime minister as well. 
  The BSP may back a motion by the Fatherland Party of Labour, 
its coalition partner, that parliament give up its summer recess 
in view of the possibility of elections in the autumn. 
According to Videnov, it is worth taking a shorter holiday so 
as to pass on second reading the Army and Armed Forces Bill or 
elections-related legislation. Videnov said the Army is in dire 
straits and it is unlikely that 2,000 million leva needed in the 
second half of the year will be allocated. Videnov has proposed 
to President Zhelev to convene the National Security 
Consultative Council for a discussion of this issue. 
  The mayoral election in Veliko Turnovo (central Bulgaria) on 
Sunday [12 June] gives us grounds to believe that the trend to 
support the Union of Democratic Forces has begun to give way, 
Doncho Konakchiev, member of the BSP supreme leadership, said 
when asked to comment on the election results. The election was 
declared invalid because of a low turn-out. According to 
Konakchiev, the results show that a change in the reform model 
is needed. According to Videnov, the BSP reached 65 per cent of 
its electoral potential in Veliko Turnovo and its supporters 
were obviously the more active. Clearly, people are not 
interested in local elections yet and parliamentary elections 
are all that matters for the time being, Videnov said.

  [Text] Sofia, June 16 (BTA) -- Today parliament continued 
its second reading of texts of the Judicial Power Act which were 
returned for discussions in the Legislative Committee. The MP's 
of the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) were present and voted. 
In late May they declared a boycott of parliament's plenary 
sittings in protest against the failure of Prof. Berov's cabinet 
to resign after its proposed reshuffle was rejected by 
parliament. However, a week ago they decided to return for the 
debates on the Judicial Power Act. 
  According to the SDS, the requirements for membership in the 
Supreme Judicial Council contradict the constitutional rights of 
the citizens. It is the duty of the deputies to be in the 
debating chamber when the Constitution is being violated, SDS 
leader Filip Dimitrov commented on the decision to return to 
parliament. Parliament did not approve the amendments proposed 
by the SDS providing for lawyers and jurisconsults to have the 
right to participate in supreme judicial bodies without the 
requirement of a five-year length of service as judges, 
prosecutors and investigators. Thus the MP's proved their firm 
intention to let arbitrariness reign supreme in Bulgaria, 
Dimitrov said, addressing the debating chamber. According to 
the SDS, in its present form this act reveals possibilities for 
political cleansing. 
  The Organized Crime Control Service should remain a central 
service, the Parliamentary National Security Committee decided 
today, debating a bill on the service. It heard representatives 
of different services of the Ministry of the Interior, who set 
forth different opinions protecting their professional areas but 
finally the Committee decided in favour of the idea for a 
central organized crime control service. The deputies addressed 
an interpellation to Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov in 
connection with numerous complaints to the committee of 
discharge of academic-rank experts from the army in violation of 
the Academic Rank Persons Act. The problem will be discussed at 
the next session of the committee due to official engagements of 
the defence minister. 
  Grain export will become imperative because of the expected 
1-1.5 -million-tonne surplus after this year's harvest, MP's of 
the Parliamentary Agriculture Committee agreed at their session 
today. A profit of 110 million leva (about $2 million) could 
have been made from last year's harvest, Lyubomir Draganov, 
chairman of the state-owned Zurno Ltd. said. The government has 
been submitted a concept for reorganizing the company with U.S. 
assistance, Draganov added. The committee also acquainted itself 
with the progress of the land reform in Bulgaria. 
  National Radio and National Television should organize broad 
public debates on the problems of culture and above all on the 
programme proposed by the Ministry of Culture for reducing the 
number of cultural institutions. This was decided at today's 
session of the Parliamentary Radio and Television Committee. The 
programme for reform in culture, which provides for the closing 
down of many theatres, galleries, cinemas, etc., was sharply 
criticized by the members of the committee. 
  The Parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee today 
approved 
a bill ratifying the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for 
Nuclear Damage, the Joint Protocol on its implementation and the 
Paris Convention on Civil Liability in Nuclear Power. By 
ratifying the Vienna Convention and the Joint Protocol Bulgaria 
will accede to international legal regulations facilitating 
trade in nuclear equipment and services.

<F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, June 13 (of BTA) -- The Russian 
parliamentary delegation, which arrived late last night led by 
Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Upper Chamber of the Russian 
Parliament, met with President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly 
Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, and 
Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. The Russian delegation 
includes the chairman of the Committee of Constitutional 
Legislation and Judicial and Legal Affairs, Elena Mizulina, and 
the members of the Upper Chamber's Committee Regulating Budget, 
Financial, Exchange, Lending, Currency Issue, Taxation and 
Customs Affairs, Mikhail Baskhmelnitsyn and Vladimir Chub. 
  "This visit to Bulgaria is not only a parliamentary one, it 
is also a state visit. It is necessary to establish closer 
political relations between Bulgaria and Russia, which will have 
an effect on their economic relations as well," Mr. Shumeyko 
said after his talk with the chairman of the Bulgarian 
Parliament. According to the chairman of the Russian Upper 
Chamber, it is impossible to treat all-European problems without 
the participation of Bulgaria and Russia. 
  At their meeting Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Shumeyko stressed the 
importance of the exchange of information between the Bulgarian 
and the Russian Parliament; Mr. Shumeyko proposed to conclude an 
agreement on interaction in the field of information and 
exchange of experience in the sphere of legislation. "It is 
very important that the Bulgarian parliamentary committees have 
access to everything that is happening in Russia now," Mr. 
Yordanov told reporters later. He believes that part of the 
problems between Bulgaria and Russia can be resolved by 
considering them first at the level of parliamentary committees. 
  The chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament said there were no 
differences between Bulgaria and Russia about European 
integration, NATO's defence structures and the Partnership for 
Peace plan. "However, it should be taken into account that 
Bulgaria and Russia are approaching the European structures from 
different positions: Bulgaria is a typically European state, a 
fact which has predetermined its Eurocentric foreign policy in 
the last years, while things are much more complicated for 
Russia because it is a vast state extending to Asia," Mr. 
Yordanov said. In his view, Russia can itself become an 
exponent of the integration idea in the contemporary world and 
this is the path it has embarked on. Asked if he fears that the 
intense interest Russian politicians have been showing in 
Bulgaria of late could affect the process of Bulgaria's 
integration with Europe and NATO, Mr. Yordanov replied in the 
negative. 
  Mr. Shumeyko said that he and Mr. Yordanov did not discuss 
the war in ex-Yugoslavia. "We paid little attention to the 
Balkan crisis, because everything is clear -- what Bulgaria and 
Russia seek is the earliest possible solution to the conflict in 
Bosnia- Herzegovina," Mr. Yordanov said in turn. "Bulgaria has 
been, and still is, suffering the heaviest losses of all as a 
result of the embargo on ex-Yugoslavia and the crisis there," 
Mr. Yordanov recalled. 
  After his meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Mr. Shumeyko 
said he hopes that during the visit by Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin to Bulgaria, scheduled for this autumn, the 
two countries would conclude a number of efficient agreements 
which their parliaments would ratified quickly thanks to the 
present parliamentary talks. "Bilateral relations are never an 
obstacle to the promotion of multilateral ones," Mr. Shumeyko 
stated. "It is Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko's shared opinion that 
Bulgarian-Russian economic relations have made little progress 
although a lot of governmental agreements were signed," 
Government Spokesman Raycho Raykov told the media. He said that 
Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko had considered the problem of mutual 
indebtedness and the Bulgarian army's urgent need of spares for 
nearly 100 percent of its facilities supplied by the ex-Soviet 
Union. 
  The talks of Russian Upper Chamber Chairman Vladimir 
Shumeyko 
and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov focussed on economic 
cooperation. Mr. Daskalov told the media that the Russian 
delegation wanted to know about any developments concerning the 
consideration of Russia's bid for the Council of Europe (on May 
11, 1994 Bulgaria took over the presidency of the Council of 
Europe's Committee of Ministers for a term of six months). 
"Russia is welcome as a full member of the Council of Europe 
but will be admitted to it when it meets the criteria for 
membership in the Council," Mr. Daskalov said. In his opinion, 
Russia's bid for membership in the Council of Europe will be 
considered during Bulgaria's presidency, but it will be 
impossible to finalize the admission procedure within its term. 
The Bulgarian foreign minister denied the allegations in some 
Bulgarian papers that Russia had offered Bulgaria to form a 
Belgrade-Sofia-Moscow axis. 
  "I have met a lot of presidents of late, but there are only 
few you can talk with about any problem as frankly as with the 
Bulgarian President," Mr. Shumeyko said after his meeting with 
President Zhelev, the last on his formal meetings during the 
visit. According to Mr. Shumeyko, most of the positions he and 
Mr. Zhelev expressed are similar, but there were moments when 
they had to explain things to each other -- the difference in 
Russia's and Bulgaria's approach to the Partnership for Peace 
initiative, for example. "Mr. Shumeyko conveyed greetings from 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Zhelev; the 
Bulgarian President sent his best wishes to Mr. Yeltsin," Kamen 
Velichkov, foreign policy advisor to the Bulgarian President, 
told the media after the meeting.

  [Text] Sofia, June 14 (BTA) -- Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman 
of the Upper Chamber of the Russian Parliament, addressing a 
news conference at the end of a three-day official visit today, 
said, "This visit is not only of a parliamentary character, it 
had been cleared with President Yeltsin and the government and 
preceded a visit to Bulgaria by Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin in the autumn." Mr. Shumeyko headed a Russian 
parliamentary delegation to this country. Yesterday he was 
received by President Zhelyu Zhelev, Parliament Chairman 
Aleksandur Yordanov, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and Foreign 
Minister Stanislav Daskalov. 
  Mr. Shumeyko stressed that Bulgaria and Russia should 
establish closer political contacts which would improve economic 
relations, now suffering from unjustified neglect. The Russian 
parliament already has a group for parliamentary contacts with 
Bulgaria. According to Mr. Shumeyko, the two parliaments should 
pass laws promoting closer ties between the two countries. 
Asked about the different positions held by Bulgaria and Russia 
on European cooperation, Mr. Shumeyko said they differed in 
their assessment of the Partnership for Peace programme. "For 
me, Partnership for Peace is an economic rather than a political 
problem," he said, recalling that in the former Soviet Union one 
in four were engaged in the military-industrial complex, while 
the proportion of these employees in Bulgaria's work force was 
smaller. 
  Mr. Shumeyko welcomed all tactical steps taken by Bulgaria 
towards its integration into Europe. As to strategy, Mr. 
Shumeyko said, the ethnic, national and spiritual ties between 
the Bulgarians and the Russians should not be forgotten. 
  This is the fourth high-level Russian delegation to Bulgaria 
this year. In February Bulgaria was visited by Ivan Rybkin, 
chairman of the State Duma, in May Patriarch Aleksiy II, and 
this month Oleg Lobovo, chief secretary of the Russian Security 
Council, made separate visits to Bulgaria.

  [Text] Sofia, June 14 (BTA) -- Bulgarian border guards 
intercepted an attempt to smuggle three trucks loaded with 
petrol across the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border at 10 AM today. The 
trucks refused to obey the border guards who were forced to use 
their guns. An unidentified person was wounded 25 m from the 
border on Bulgarian territory, his life being out of danger. He 
was rendered medical aid. 
  An extraordinary meeting with Yugoslav border authorities is 
being held on the site of the incident to clarify all 
circumstances. Experts of the regional directorate of the 
interior in the town of Montana have been sent to the site of 
the incident, the Press Office of the Interior Ministry reported.

  [Text] Sofia, June 16 (BTA) -- The international community 
and the World Bank are impressed by the Bulgarian Government's 
efforts to reduce the budget deficit and stabilize the national 
economy, said Michael Wiehen, World Bank regional director for 
Europe and Central Asia, at a press conference today. Michael 
Wiehen is heading a World Bank delegation to this country. 
According to him, the government is close to signing a deal 
with Bulgaria's London Club creditors and the World Bank is 
ready to support this deal. 
  Support will be rendered parallel with the International 
Monetary Fund and will find expression in a special loan which 
the World Bank will extend to Bulgaria this summer. Michael 
Wiehen declined to specify the exact size of the loan but said 
it would be a considerable sum. It will depend on the final 
balance of the separate instruments chosen by the creditor banks 
and on their final deal with Bulgaria. The loan will be granted 
for a period of 17 years with a four-year grace period. 
  The assistance rendered by the World Bank to Bulgaria is 
aimed above all at stepping up economic growth, Michael Wiehen 
said. He projected that this year the Bulgarian economy will 
probably mark zero growth but, according to World Bank experts, 
next year's growth will be positive. The only exception may be 
agriculture, which under favourable meteorological conditions 
may register positive growth already this year. 
  The World Bank is closely following privatization in 
Bulgaria 
as decisive for this country's transition to market economy. 
Special attention should be paid to bank privatization and 
strengthening the supervision of the commercial banks by the 
central bank, Michael Wiehen said. According to John Wilton, 
World Bank resident representative in Bulgaria, at present the 
central bank has small potentials for exercising such control. 
Some legislative changes are necessary in order to strengthen 
it. John Wilton described the state of the banking system as a 
whole as not very good, which is due to the interdependence 
between the banks and state-owned enterprises and their "bad 
debts." According to John Wilton, some of the banks in this 
country may be privatized in the following 12 months.

  [Text] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Jan Strasky, the 
representative of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in a 
coalition commission dealing with the restitution of church 
property, has proposed that in the first phase the commission 
focus on settlement of the church property question, from which 
it would later draw a line heading for "the restitution full 
stop." 
  Speaking at a press conference today, Strasky said the ODS 
was interested in a rapid agreement. The party still insists 
that only the state be the obliged person, and that the issue be 
not described as restitution but "equipping of church 
organizations with the property they need to carry out their 
activities," Strasky emphasized. The ODS also keeps to its 
proposal that the return of the church property be not settled 
by a law but through individual government regulations, he said. 
  Strasky said the ODS supported the prior return of those 
buildings from the state property which could continue to serve 
the spiritual and administrative purposes of individual 
churches, or as accommodation facilities for church 
representatives. The buildings and premises which have been 
serving social, cultural, and education purposes, should be 
returned where churches were ready to carry out these activities 
serving the public, under the same conditions -- including the 
amount of state subsidies -- as everybody in this sphere, 
Strasky said on behalf of the ODS.

  [Excerpt] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Attacks against the 
post-war decrees issued by President Edvard Benes and a campaign 
conducted against the completion of the Lidice monument were 
linked to "the dangerous manifestations of covert or even overt 
support for fascism" by Miroslav Grebenicek today. 
  In his statement given to CTK, Grebenicek, chairman of the 
Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), said that the way 
in which Benes was being attacked and scandalized "is too 
reminiscent of the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler and Czech 
collaborators (with fascism)." "We reject resolutely any 
challenging of the results of World War Two because similar 
steps would be not only an offense to the millions of victims of 
fascism, but a dangerous step leading to the destabilization of 
the whole of Europe as well," the statement says. 
  It warns that he who "supports the attacks (against the 
Benes 
decrees) threatens our national identity and opens up the road 
towards unlimited property restitution which would lead to the 
total collapse of not only the economy, but all social life in 
the Czech Republic." 
  Under the decrees, some 2.5 [million] Sudeten Germans were 
expelled from Czechoslovakia and their property was confiscated. 
The Sudeten German Landsmannschaft has now been claiming the 
property and the recognition of the right to homeland. [passage

  [Text] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Czech Health Minister 
Ludek Rubas today rejected as false the claims by Jiri Nemec, 
director of the General Health Insurance Company (VZP), about 
the VZP's bad financial situation and stressed that "the health 
insurance system is facing no collapse." 
  In the parliamentary health committee yesterday, Nemec said 
that the VZP, which covers health care for three-quarters of the 
population, might enter the next year with a deficit of 5.5 
billion crowns (about $183 million). Nemec said that this is 
due to the tension between the limited revenues of the health 
insurance system and the growing expenditures on health care. 
  "Health care costs are not rising according to how much 
people are ill, but according to how often the doctors are 
inviting them for examinations so that they gather as many 
points as possible for which they get money," Nemec said. 
  Unless the Health Ministry and the parliament adopt 
regulatory measures to stop the doctors' hunt for points, the 
health insurance system may collapse, Nemec warned yesterday. 
He said that this would necessitate either higher health 
insurance payments which now constitute 13.5 percent of an 
employee's pre-tax pay or patients would have to start paying 
extra money in doctors' surgeries. A third variant is to 
decrease the point's value, according to the number of which 
doctors are paid. But experts believe that this method would 
paralyze health care, Nemec said. 
  The VZP and the parliamentary committee have agreed that the 
system based on the number of points only had to be regulated. 
Health insurance companies should be free not to pay for the 
examinations which prove unnecessary, restrict prescription of 
costly foreign medicaments, or introduce patients' higher 
financial contribution to some types of treatment. 
  Nemec said yesterday that health care was sufficiently 
funded. "With the seven percent from gross national product we 
have secured for us a leading position among poorer countries. 
But unfortunately we are not capable of appropriately managing 
the money." 
  A statement from the Health Ministry given to CTK today said 
that the ministry was attentively following the financing of 
medical care, analyzing the present state, and studying 
regulatory mechanisms. 
  Rubas has submitted to the parliament and government several 
proposals of late. It plans to amend the Health Code and 
legislation on insurance, insurance companies, including a list 
of medical performance categories and categories of medicaments, 
and to restrict patients' uncontrollable access to specialists. 
  The amendments are to be discussed in the autumn, the 
statement says. It adds that Rubas has not found any reason to 
raise the health insurance rates because he believes that the 
insurance companies had the possibility to turn to revision 
doctors to examine whether particular treatment was necessary. 
The law not only renders this possible, but even orders the 
companies to do so, the statement says. Rubas and Nemec will 
meet tomorrow to discuss the above problems.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 June (MTI) -- The Presidium and the 
parliamentary group of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) held 
a five-hour joint session on Wednesday [15 June] evening. 
Topics discussed included how the former ruling party should 
prepare for its four-year opposition role, party spokesman 
Karoly Herenyi said at a press conference in Budapest on 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  Among the tasks considered the most important by the MDF are 
to protect the Constitution and law, to preserve the 
achievements of the last four years, to safeguard human freedom 
rights and private property, and to enforce freedom of the press 
at least to the extent that characterized the last four years. 
According to the two bodies, the press can be both a brake and 
a guarantee against the future two-thirds coalition majority. 
  The participants set down as a basic principle that the MDF 
would like to receive at least 10 percent of the places in the 
newly formed parliamentary committees, but would consider it 
ideal if it could enjoy the same conditions as the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) did in the previous cycle, in other 
words, that it receive greater representation than its numeric 
proportion, and have a representative in all parliamentary 
committees.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- The National Election 
Committee (NEC) has declared the official final results of the 
first and second rounds of the general elections, after the 
Supreme Court approved its decision on modifying the results in 
the sixth constituency -- Gyor-Moson-Sopron County (W Hungary) 
-- where Gyorgy Rasko (HDF) finished in first place after the 
re-count, instead of Gyula Varga (AFD). Thus, the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum receives one more seat (bringing the total to 
38) in Hungary's 386-seat National Assembly, while the Alliance 
of Free Democrats has one seat less (total: 69).

  [Text] Budapest, 16 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- In the first 
quarter of this year, industrial output grew by 9 percent 
compared to the same period last year. The increase was mainly 
registered in the manufacturing industry. Energy consumption 
fell by 5 to 6 percent as compared to the corresponding period 
last year, according to the Finance Ministry's most recent 
report on the economy's first quarter performance. 
  Exports increased more slowly than imports, but the gap is 
gradually narrowing. According to preliminary customs figures, 
Hungarian companies exported products to a value of $2.9 billion 
by the end of April, 4.7 percent up on the same period last 
year. Imports amounted to $4 billion, which shows a 7 percent 
increase as compared to the first four months in 1993. With the 
increase in imports falling from month to month, the ministry 
projects a slower increase in imports for the year. Food 
industry accounted for most of the increase in exports. Exports 
of machines were moderate, while their import significantly 
increased. According to ministry analysts the drop in machine 
exports and the growth in machine imports indicate that domestic 
investment demand is on the rise, which should contribute to 
long-term growth in the economy. 
  In the first quarter, enterprises spent 65 billion forints 
on 
investments, 59 percent up on the same period of last year at 
current prices. The ministry's report predicts a 5 to 10 
percent increase in the volume of investments for 1994. 
However, analysts are cautious about drawing conclusions from 
these figures.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- The gross debt burden of 
the country has risen by HUF [Hungarian forint] 1.763 trillion 
over the past three years. Of this, HUF 547 billion is from the 
central budget deficit, part of which is due to the doubling of 
net interest payments, according to the Finance Ministry's 
report on Hungary's debts in the period between 1990 and 1993. 
  Government spokesperson Judit Juhasz told the press that the 
situation improved only in the period between 1990 and 1992. 
Last year's figures already showed a current account deficit 
which was only partly counter-balanced by a considerable amount 
of direct foreign investments. 
  Juhasz said the government had authorized the minister of 
international economic relations to sign a European agreement on 
the modification and extension of eased taxation terms. As a 
result of this, from July 1, Hungary will be able to export 
products such as meat and grain to European Union member-states 
under more favourable terms.

  [Text] Budapest, 16 Jun (MTI) -- Contrary to current 
rumours being spread by the international press, Hungary has not 
delivered any weapons to the secessionists in South Yemen, 
according to Gyorgy Buda, deputy head of the Export Control 
Office at the Ministry of International Economic Relations, who 
made an official statement to MTI on Thursday. 
  Information on weapon exports is usually secret, unless the 
head of the inter-departmental commission monitoring exports 
gives permission to disclose specific data. Having received 
such permission, Buda said, "Hungary's Government has not had 
any contact with military forces in South Yemen in the past 
three years, as it officially recognizes the Sanaa government, 
and there cannot have been any legal weapon deliveries from 
Hungary to Yemen without an official end-use guarantee from this 
government." 
  "Under a decree issued to Hungary's inter-departmental 
commission monitoring exports, the delivery of weapons to crisis 
zones is prohibited. Accordingly, Hungarian weapons cannot have 
been exported to Yemen, even with Saudi Arabian assistance. In 
addition, the falsehood of such rumours is obvious from the fact 
that Hungary has no weapons for sale of the type mentioned by 
the press." 
  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Janos Herman told MTI that the 
Hungarian ambassador to Yemen has visited their Foreign Ministry 
twice in order to assure all the officials concerned that these 
rumours have no grounds. Hungary's official statement on the 
issue has been acknowledged.

  [Text] Poznan, June 16 -- Deputy Prime Minister and Finance 
Minister Grzegorz Kolodko stressed in Poznan on Thursday that 
according to Polish businessmen, the "Strategy for Poland" 
provides for a credible economic programme. Kolodko met with 
businessmen, bankers, and scholars during the Poznan 
international fair to discuss the future of the Polish economy. 
  "The programme is credible for the International Monetary 
Fund (IMF), that is for the people who can count money much 
better than us. The programme is also credible for the 
ministers responsible for the economy and finance in countries 
of the European Union," Kolodko added. 
  Deputy President of the Polish Business Council Jan Kulczyk 
stressed that its members were satisfied with the way the 
government solved the question of taxes in the programme. He 
called on the minister to ensure the same conditions for Polish 
capital as there are for foreign investors in Poland. Foreign 
companies should play a complementary role in Poland's economic 
development and new companies should be protected by the 
government. 
  Polish businessmen also talked about the possibilities of 
cooperation with companies in the east, including China. It was 
emphasised that without the support of the government policy it 
would be difficult to regain the previous position on the 
markets of the former Soviet Union. The finance minister said 
the government had already adopted some regulations aimed to 
boost economic cooperation and not only export expansion to the 
east. The government assumes that exports and imports with the 
east will increase faster in the years 1994-1997. Kolodko also 
spoke about the government's efforts to solve the problem of 
mutual debt. 
  Minister for Foreign Economic Relations Leslaw Podkanski, 
who 
also participated in the meeting, told Polish businessmen that 
his ministry keeps a data bank on eastern markets. He also said 
that his ministry is planning to set up eight trade centres east 
of Poland.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The Senate on Thursday adopted 
the unchanged version of the law on the management of property 
left to the state treasury by the Russian Army formerly 
stationed in Poland. Senators had proposed a few changes in the 
text but the house finally rejected them in order to finish work 
on this urgent issue. 
  The newly-adopted law says that the property is now managed 
by provincial governors who may pass this responsibility on to 
local governments if the latter want it. Forests will be 
administered by the state forests management. Property of 
special importance for national defence will be taken over by 
the Defence Ministry. 
  The former Soviet and later Russian Army left in Poland 
nearly 8,000 buildings and other property worth over 158 million 
U.S. dollars. To upgrade this property to a reasonable 
condition, Poland will have to spend nearly 93 million U.S. 
dollars, while the estimated value of ecological damage amounts 
to about 53 trillion zlotys (2.5 billion U.S. dollars). Some 
30-40 per cent of the property, mainly buildings, have already 
been overhauled and are used. 
  The Senate also adopted the law on restructuring the 
co-operative banks. Under this law, the co-operative banks will 
be grouped in nine regional banks, and the Bank of Food Economy 
(BGZ) will be transformed into a joint stock company and will 
play the role of the national bank. Within five years, its 
shares will be sold to cooperative banks. 
  The Senate decided to make no changes in the recently 
amended 
law on corporate income tax. According to the amendemnt, bank 
reserves covering bad credits will be considered as the bank's 
costs and in that way banks will pay lower taxes. If the 
amended law is signed by the president, the state central budget 
will get 1.7 trillion zlotys less.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The permanent observer status 
given to Poland by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Western 
European Union (WEU) is unsatisfactory, head of the delegation 
of the Polish Parliament for spring session of the WEU assembly 
Deputy Longin Pastusiak said upon his arrival from a WEU session 
in Paris. The present status makes it impossible for the Polish 
delegation to cast votes, participate in committees' work and 
forward amendments to reports. 
  Speaking to journalists Pastusiak said that Poland's full 
integration with WEU, which under the Maastricht Treaty is to 
become an armed organization of the European Union, remains one 
of the priorities of the Polish policy. In his opinion, odds 
are that efforts of Polish delegation to attain this goal will 
bring results during the December session of the WEU 
Parliamentary Assembly.

  [Text] Gdansk, June 15 -- Several customers of a bank in 
the Gdansk province have been approached recently by Nigerian 
institutions and asked to agree to have big money transferred on 
their accounts. In return the Nigerians offered 30 percent of 
the transferred amount, a bank staffer told PAP on Wednesday. 
The bank customers rejected the Nigerian proposal and notified 
the bank whose authorities believe the Nigerians were trying to 
launder money in Poland. The Nigerians wanted to transfer many 
million dollars to each account. 
  The proposals came from the Nigerian Federal Ministry of 
Industry and Trade and the Federal Ministry of National Defence. 
The Nigerians justified their proposal with the unstable 
situation in their country and asked to keep the operation in 
secret. 
  A similar proposal was reported on Wednesday by the 
"DZIENNIK 
BALTYCKI" daily which wrote that the Nigerian Construction 
Ministry and the Nigerian national oil corporation wanted to 
transfer 57 million U.S. dollars. They wanted to pay 17.8 
million U.S. dollars for the transaction and sacrificed further 
4.2 million dollars for the servicing costs, read: bribes.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 16 -- The Nigerian Embassy denied on 
Thursday the information that Nigerian ministries had attempted 
to transfer millions of dollars to the accounts of Gdansk 
institutions. 
  PAP reported on Wednesday that two Nigerian federal 
ministries of industry and trade, and of national defence 
approached customers of one of the Gdansk banks and asked them 
to have the money transfered on their accounts in return for 30 
per cent of the transferred amount. A similar proposal made 
allegedly by the Nigerian Construction Ministry and the Nigerian 
Oil Corporation was reported in the "DZIENNIK BALTYCKI" daily 
quoted by the PAP. 
  The embassy states in its communique sent to PAP on Thursday 
that all these "so-called federal ministries are fake" and adds 
that "the letters reportedly circulating among some banks in 
Gdansk have not emanated from federal government ministries or 
any federal government corporation." 
  The embassy claims that such letters are "handiwork of 
fraudsters using fictitious names and titles, and aimed at 
duping unwary and greedy foreign businessmen." 
  The embassy reported on similar cases in its recent regular 
news bulletin of February 1994 and warned the Polish business 
community to be on alert. The embassy advised recepients of 
such letters to report to the embassy but the banks in Gdansk 
chose to ignore this advise, reads the communique.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 15/6/1994 -- "Big trade union 
confederations -- Alfa Cartel especially -- gave us notice about 
a lot of union actions to be developed on June 14-21," said 
Octavian Partenie, secretary of state, head of the Government's 
Office for relations with trade unions and employers' 
organizations. 
  Referring to the union claims and the dialogue of government 
and unions, Octavian Partenie said "that their claims reached us 
through media." He added that "many of the claims are already 
settled or in the process of settlement, some are to be 
negotiated as they can not be settled on the spot and other ones 
cannot be even discussed." In the unrealistic claims ranking, 
the official mentioned a 50 per cent salary increase, a claim 
which means that "if we proceed to a 50 per cent salary rise 
today, we will have tomorrow a 60 per cent price increase and 
followed by a new salary increase, unemployment increase rate 
and a population increase rate who cannot live a decent 
life...and again a spiralling inflation." 
  At the end of his interview, Octavian Partenie expressed his 
confidence in a reciprocal wish for dialogue. "Only in a 
receptive and responsible dialogue can we find the proper 
solutions," he underlined, noticing that at the present stage 
unions should look towards the employers' organizations. "It is 
with the employers' organizations that they are conducting talks 
now and so it will be in the future too," said the Romanian 
official.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- For several weeks 
the Chamber of Deputies has debated the Education Act, seen as 
the second most important law of this country after the 
Constitution. The law will pass when key provisions, such as the 
ones regulating education in minority languages, are solved. To 
these, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] has 
many objections in their draft form. 
  The chapter in question, the thirteenth, being the most 
difficult to adopt, a Parliament member came the other day with 
the idea that the chapter should be skipped over and remanded to 
a special group formed of the senior members of the [Chamber of 
Deputies] Education Committee and the leaders of the 
parliamentary groups, while the plenum goes on with the debates 
on the following chapters. 
  So, while the chamber tackled other sections of the draft, 
negotiations took place in what the daily newspaper ADEVARUL 
calls "the less transparent corners of the Education Committee 
and the chamber's permanent bureau," and "maybe even between the 
ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] and the UDMR." 
  The bone of contention are two articles of this Chapter 13, 
namely the one stipulating that at all school levels the history 
and geography of Romania should be taught in Romanian language, 
and the other says that objects of study specific for the 
technical, medical, agricultural, juridical, and economic 
streams, whatever the level, should be taught in Romanian. 
According to press news, the ruling party is reportedly 
favoring the provisions above for various reasons, one of them 
being the insistent request by some of its political allies (the 
National Unity Party of Romania, the Greater Romania Party), and 
some independent members of parliament, namely that "the history 
and geography of Romania be taught exclusively in the official 
language of the Romanian state," that is, in Romanian. 
  Commenting the first round of talks on this issue, CRONICA 
ROMANA remarks that "it ended with an agreement on the teaching 
of geography and civic education in the languages of minorities, 
and of teaching only history in Romanian language." A second 
and a third round of consultations have failed so far to bring 
the sides' positions any nearer. 
  With the consultations going on until late, the following 
morning (Thursday, 16 June), the plenum debates started two 
hours later than scheduled. 
  The same morning, a UDMR press release informed that its 
presidium had reached the conclusion, at its latest meeting, 
that the articles so far adopted from the draft of the education 
act "do not help solve the problem to the effect desired by the 
UDMR," and that the still valid education law, enacted during 
the communist regime, was "more permissive than the draft 
currently under debate."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- During a news 
conference on June 16, in Oradea, reformed Bishop Laszlo Tokes, 
mentioned that the article speaking about him and issued 
recently in the TINERAMA newspaper "seemed unrealistic, a 
diversion built by the Securitate, in close connection with the 
present power and the nationalist extremists." 
  In the article in TINERAMA, journalist Ioan Itu supposed the 
former priest had belonged to the Romanian Securitate, and to 
prove it, the journalist published in the above mentioned issue 
the facsimile of Tokes' engagement paper with that organization. 
The mentioned newspaper also told about a 20,000 lei-bill 
handed over by Laszlo Tokes to a Hungarian secret service 
officer. 
  On June 16, the Episcopal Reformed Diocese Office belonging 
to Piatra Craiului also mentioned in an official statement that 
the main reason for this slander is to discredit the [1989] 
revolution started in Timisoara and to disgrace the heads of 
revolution and the democratic opposition.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- The Romanian 
parliamentary delegation, headed by Adrian Nastase, speaker of 
the Chamber of Deputies, returned on 15 June from an official 
three-day visit to the Czech Republic. On arrival at Otopeni 
Airport, Speaker Nastase told the press that the Prague visit 
was a "success." "We have felt there much warmth and a great 
readiness for revigorating the political, economic and cultural 
relations between the two countries." 
  Also, Adrian Nastase assessed as "encouraging" the messages 
got on the occasion, referring in particular to the Czech 
standpoint according to which Romania has to become member of 
the "Central-European initiative." "These aspects, associated 
with the visit President Vaclav Havel will pay the next few days 
to Bucharest, prove a real will at this moment for an 
intensification of the bilateral relations", Adrian Nastase 
stated.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 16/6/1994 -- Romanian-Chinese 
consultations at deputy minister level ended in Bucharest on 16 
June. The two delegations, headed by Qin Huasun, deputy foreign 
minister, and Ion Gorita, secretary of state, approached matters 
of multilateral diplomacy and especially problems on the UN 
agenda. 
  The visit to be paid here at the beginning of July by Li 
Peng, president of the Council of State of the People's Republic 
of China, the first at this level after 1990 paid by a Chinese 
official to Central and Eastern Europe, was also discussed by 
the two deputy ministers. 
  Regarding the multilateral diplomacy, the two delegations 
referred to such topics as the UN's reform and restructuring, 
especially concerning the Security Council, the peace-keeping 
operations, regional conflicts, with stress on developments in 
ex-Yugoslavia, human rights, and disarmament. Both parties 
expressed their "concern" in connection with the recent 
developments in the Korean peninsula and stressed that what was 
needed was "a political settlement negotiated among all parties 
concerned." 
  The representatives of the Chinese and Romanian foreign 
ministers noted pursuant to the consultations the existence of 
an "identity" of standpoints between the two countries 
concerning the major issues of concern to the UN. It was agreed 
that, based on the fine relations of cooperation, such kind of 
consultations should be continued, in view of establishing 
common modalities of action for the future UN session (September 
1994.)

  [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- Miklos Duray, chairman 
of the Hungarian minority movement Egyutteles [Coexistence], 
today told CTK the Hungarian parties would manage to compromise 
with the other government coalition parties on Friday [17 June] 
on the use of bilingual names for towns in which the Hungarian 
population makes at least 5 percent. 
  "The maintenance of the government coalition majority 
position in parliament will depend on this compromise," Duray 
said. "We are for compromise whereby the official names of the 
communities are not changed but the Hungarian name is also used 
on road signs," he said. 
  Two weeks ago three deputies from Egyutteles did not support 
the draft bill on place names. A bill which would put a full 
stop to a year-long dispute on bilingual place names was thus 
not passed with only one vote lacking. 
  The bill, rejected by the Slovak Parliament on June 3, would 
have enabled the use of bilingual (Slovak and Hungarian) names 
for towns and villages in which the ethnic minority populations 
make up at least one fifth. 
  In spite of promises made to the Council of Europe by 
ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar, the president and parliament 
chairman, the situation has not changed since last October when 
residents of the village of Marcelova erected a road sign of 
their own with the Hungarian name of the village -- 
"Marczelhaza." This provoked a prompt reaction by the then 
Transport Minister Roman Hofbauer who ordered the removal of the 
sign. 
  The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik which relies on 
Hungarian deputies for a majority in parliament, has already 
fulfilled its promise -- Slovak Hungarians may now use the 
native language form of their first and second names. 
  However, parliament failed to pass the agreed version of the 
place names law because nationalist-orientated coalition 
deputies protested against the inclusion of villages and towns 
named after historical Slovak figures into the list of more than 
500 communities which would have to use bilingual signs. These 
deputies along with the three of 13 Hungarian deputies voted 
against the law. 
  Duray said that not only were former members of the Slovak 
National Party (SNS), who joined the government camp under the 
name of the National Democrats, responsible for the failure but 
also some deputies from the Democratic Left Party (SDL). 
  "Although they justify their stand by the election campaign 
their position has deeper roots," Duray said. "The SDL 
maintains that it would lose voters in northern Slovakia should 
it approve the law and agree to the use of Hungarian names also 
for 16 villages," (where 40,000 Hungarians live) which are named 
after famous Slovaks. 
  Duray said that the government should count on the failure 
of 
its further plans if it were not be able to solve this issue. 
"I hope the government is wise enough to find an acceptable 
compromise in order we continue to support it," Duray said, 
adding that the position of Egyutteles deputies at the next 
parliamentary session would depend on the future of the place 
name law. At this session parliament is to discuss projects 
which are of key importance for keeping the budget deficit 
within the limits acceptable to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and obtaining a highly-desirable loan. 
  "One of the deputies from the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH), Pal Farkas, admitted at a Coalition Council 
meeting today that Hungarian deputies would not necessarily vote 
together with the government coalition," Duray warned. He 
assured, however, that he personally would assess economic 
questions pragmatically and would not link them to the road sign 
law.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 15 (CTK) -- Bilingual road signs 
in towns and villages inhabited by ethnic minority populations 
are part of the European standard which should be reached by 
Slovakia before the autumn elections, Pal Farkas, deputy 
chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH), 
today told CTK. "If a new government bill on place names, to be 
submitted on Friday [17 June], is acceptable for us and the 
coalition I see no reason why it should not be discussed at the 
next parliamentary session," he said. 
  He admitted that he told the Coalition Council today that 
the 
government should not necessarily be supported by Hungarian 
deputies who secure its majority in parliament. "It was 
necessary to recall that our agreement with the coalition as 
well as the recommendations by the Council of Europe are in 
effect. According to the agreement we support the government 
provided it solves this problem also. If the coalition is 
unwilling to do so nobody can expect blind support from us," he 
said. "We are flexible to a certain extent. If a new bill 
allows for a referendum to decide on bilingual road signs then 
we would be able to back it," Farkas said. 
  He said that aggravation of the problems surrounding the 
place names law can indisputably be ascribed to the election 
campaign in which the national feelings of voters are exploited, 
he said. "For us, however, it is a question of our identity. 
We live here, and have our own language so why should not we 
name our villages and towns in our native language as it is 
generally accepted everywhere in Europe," Farkas said.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava June 16 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
"The policy of economic transition must aim for two quite 
contradictory goals -- creating conditions for economic growth 
and employment and maintaining macroeconomic stability," says 
Brigita Schmognerova, deputy [prime] minister for the economy, 
in an interview in PRAVDA. 
  That part of transition representing adaptation to new 
conditions on a microeconomic level is more difficult and 
longer-term, she says, and involves mainly the entrepreneurial 
sector, but also requires consumers and employees to change. 
The minister notes that the Slovak economy continues to have 
certain basic advantages over that of Poland or Hungary, though 
it does have its difficulties. 
  The basis for further development of the economy which the 
current Moravcik cabinet has promised to lay down is inspiring a 
trust in the government's economic policies -- something that 
will give the country access to lower cost credit, Schmognerova 
told the paper. 
  During talks with the International Monetary Fund on the 
provision of a stand-by loan, for example, the government 
strived to specify goals and instruments that correspond to 
Slovak conditions, and are realistic and realisable, says the 
minister. "The opposition is trying to make the International 
Monetary Fund out to be a bogeyman," PRAVDA quotes Schmognerova 
responding to accusations that the government is being too 
accommodating towards the international organisation. 
  Instead, sticking to those goals will ensure Slovakia's 
ability to repay its loans, showing that the government's 
economic policy is reliable, not just in the eyes of the IMF but 
more generally.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia June 17 (CTK) -- "Vladimir 
Meciar as Slovak premier ordered the Interior Ministry to watch 
head of its secretariat Anna Nagyova at the time when there was 
a minor misunderstanding between them," Ludovit Cernak, 
parliament deputy chairman and chairman of the National 
Democratic Party (NDS) confirms in the daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD 
today. 
  Asked by the daily, Cernak confirmed the existence of a 
private firm which acts as information and intelligence agency 
for ex-Premier Meciar. The firm, according to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, 
obtained "unofficial" information about Slovak high-ranking 
politicians. The paper says that Jaroslav Svechota, former 
Slovak interior minister in 1990 when Meciar led the ministry, 
works in the firm. 
  Cernak says that he has documents to prove that Meciar, in 
the interests of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), 
corrupted the Slovak National Party (SNS) when Cernak was its 
chairman, and had thus contributed to the victory of 
non-tolerant and radical wing.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava June 15 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
"The frontier between decent and indecent manners, prosperity 
and poverty, success and failure must not end at the River 
Morava (bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia)," honorary 
chairman of the New Slovakia (NS) movement Rudolf Mosny tells 
today's independent daily NARODNA OBRODA. 
  The NS, which presented itself for the first time on Tuesday 
[14 June], adheres to the values of "modern liberalism" based on 
the inviolability of democratic values and efficient market 
economy vouching for social security, says Mosny, a businessman 
who has returned after several years in exile in the USA to 
Slovakia. 
  Many problems have been caused by privatisation which has 
become a political tool, says Mosny, adding that the 
Privatisation Ministry should be abolished because it can be 
easily substituted by the National Property Fund and "world 
professional organisations with perfect skill with respect to 
privatisation. Everything must be subordinated to the aim which 
is revitalisation of the company. Neither coupon privatisation 
nor employees' shares are such technique. They can be applied 
only if the company flourishes," Mosny states. 
  The time has come for the positive influences of the West to 
arrive in Slovakia, he says. "There is economic instability, 
poor taxation, political fragmentation, corruption -- all the 
bad influences from the West here," Mosny stresses. It is 
untenable that 63 "billionaires," but also 50 percent of people 
living below the poverty line, are registered in Bratislava, he 
adds.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 16 (CTK) -- The visit by a mission 
of representatives of the U.S. Overseas Private Investment 
Corporation (OPIC) will be an important catalyst for American 
investment here, Premier Jozef Moravcik said on Slovak Radio 
today. Slovakia needs the help of foreign investors because it 
lacks sufficient resources of its own to revive the economy, 
Moravcik said after meeting with the mission, headed by OPIC 
Vice President Christopher Finn and made up of 25 business 
leaders. 
  U.S. investment in Slovakia remains low, said Moravcik, 
noting that the government would like individual countries to 
have adequate shares. He added that Slovakia was mainly 
interested in investment in the manufacturing sector. U.S. 
investors have expressed interest mainly in the energy industry, 
production of goods important for environmental protection, and 
tourism, Moravcik noted. 
  Moravcik said Slovakia offered good conditions for 
investment, though some changes to the legal system are needed, 
as is the creation of a stable political situation. OPIC is an 
independent U.S. Government agency focused on supporting 
economic growth in countries with developing market economies by 
stimulating private U.S. investment activities.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 16 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik expects his forthcoming meeting with Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus to be a "certain inventarization of questions which 
are still open" between the two countries. Klaus and Moravcik 
are to meet at the international forum of politicians and 
economists in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. 
  "We will tell each other which problems can be settled at 
present and which cannot," Moravcik told CTK today. He pointed 
out that Slovakia had taken an accommodating stance towards 
Prague's demands as regards the introduction of a standard 
border regime. 
  Moravcik said he viewed as extremely urgent the abolition of 
the "old bloc" of the clearing account in trade between the 
Czech and Slovak Republics, where accounts are made in the ratio 
1:1. This becomes subject of speculation and harms the Slovak 
budget, he added. "We would like to reach an agreement, as the 
problem is very urgent," Moravcik stated. He admitted that the 
main problem was that of covering the rate differences in the 
transfer of payments to the rate of the Czech and Slovak 
currencies towards ECU [European Currency Unit]. 
  "There are more ways of solving the issue, but two of them 
can be considered. The rate differences would either be shared 
-- in some specific way -- by the two sides, or the solution of 
the differences would be left with enterprises, debtors, and 
creditors themselves," Moravcik said. He said he did not expect 
any changes in the functioning of the clearing scheme, though 
the two parties were likely to express their stances in 
Crans-Montana. The four-day forum starts today.

Assembly. In evening they are taken to their homes. During the 
night, only the Serbian police and few Serbians. [sentence as 
received] The Serbian chairman of the Podujeve Communal 
Assembly told the BORBA newspaper that the Serbians make up 1.6 
percent of the total population while there are Albanians are 
120,000.

<F P=106> [Report by Suzana Kos from the Crans Montana economic forum </F>
in Switzerland] 
  [Excerpt] The chairman of the morning plenum, Czech 
President Vaclav Klaus, called on the participants to think 
primarily in two directions: about the changes that could be 
seen over the past year in the participating countries 
themselves, and in their relations with foreign countries. 
  The first one to speak about his experiences this morning 
was 
Slovene Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek. He presented the 
encouraging results that our country has accomplished. He drew 
attention to the growth in GNP, which is expected to amount to 5 
percent this year. He also spoke of the stability of our 
currency, inflation, which is under control, and decreasing 
unemployment. Drnovsek very adamantly pointed at the blackmail 
by Italy which has blocked Slovenia's access to the European 
Union because of unresolved bilateral relations between the 
countries. For this reason, Prime Minister Drnovsek said after 
talks with Croatian Prime Minister Valentic, it is particularly 
in the interests of Slovenia and Croatia to resolve open 
questions and thus consolidate their international positions. 
  Today the Slovene and the Croatian representatives mostly 
discussed three pressing issues that are burdening the relations 
between the countries: the Zagreb branch of Ljubljanska Banka, 
the Krsko nuclear power plant, and the sea border in Piran Bay. 
  Regarding the nuclear power plant, there are no longer any 
major differences. Concerning Piran Bay, Slovenia cannot step 
back from its position. Regarding the issue of the Croatian 
savers, there is still a difference amounting to approximately 
250 million German marks, Prime Minister Drnovsek said: 
  [Begin Drnovsek recording] It has transpired once again, 
just like during our last meeting, that it is impossible to find 
solutions for certain areas individually, and the question poses 
itself whether we should perhaps resolve them in a package; that 
is, in a package where giving way on one issue would mean 
gaining on another. Prime Minister Valentic and I actually 
discussed such a hypothetical speculation or offer. [passage 
omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] [Announcer] Talks between the Czech and the Slovak 
Government delegations ended a little while ago at the Crans 
Montana in Switzerland. The delegations are headed by Prime 
Ministers Vaclav Klaus and Jozef Moravcik. After their talks 
the Czech prime minister granted an exclusive interview to Czech 
Radio, in which he summed up the talks. 
  [Begin Klaus recording] As far as the topics are concerned, 
these are the issues which keep returning. I think it is 
appropriate on this level to say [word indistinct]. I will sum 
this up for you. 
  First, the issue of our unfortunate certificates. I think 
that the new element is that Slovakia has recently held talks 
with the European Communities about easing the situation for the 
European Communities in this sphere. This means that they will 
not require certain certificates. In fact it would be a measure 
discriminating against the Czech side if Irish, Portuguese, and 
Danish exporters are not obliged to acquire certificates, while 
Czech exporters would be obliged to acquire them. 
  We received an assurance, an unequivocal assurance from the 
Slovak side, an assurance which I perceive as a very positive 
one, that, first, nothing has been signed with the European 
Communities, only talks have been held; second, the Slovak side 
considers it self-evident that if such an agreement with the 
European Communities is concluded, it is clear that it will be 
applied automatically in the same way for the Czech Republic. 
Therefore, any discrimination can be ruled out. I think that 
this is the first important thing. 
  I would appreciate if our mass media make this clear because 
it is unfortunate to quote each other untruthfully. I would be 
really grateful to you if you could communicate this clearly. 
  Second, we spoke about the so-called old bloc -- all of us 
know what it means. Both sides have expressed interest in 
abolishing this old bloc, in putting it forward to the two 
parliaments to approve this. This means that the Slovak 
parliament has to do so by August, when it is to hold its last 
session before the elections. We would put this forward to our 
parliament at its July session because it does not hold any 
session in August. 
  Yes, there is an interest in abolishing the old bloc in the 
way which would make it impossible for any obligations to emerge 
between the two states, between the governments or between the 
government and enterprises in the given country. This means 
tackling the issue of any remaining relations on the level of 
enterprises. This is an important conclusion. It is 
unequivocally formulated and I think this is a good result, too. 
  Third, the old bloc concerns a payment agreement that will 
require an amendment concerning the abolition of the old bloc. 
This will of course be put forward to the two parliaments. 
  We have been alarmed by some statements made by the Slovak 
side about the necessity or lack thereof to revise the payment 
agreement as such. We reached an unequivocal assurance that we 
consider the clearing mechanism to be something that makes 
payments between enterprises of the two countries easier. 
Neither the Czech side nor the Slovak side see any reason for 
abolishing the payment system based on the clearing relation 
between our countries. We may improve or modify some of its 
particular points. We should not indicate to each other that 
one side wants to abolish it; that is untrue, and it would 
worsen and complicate our relations. This is the third 
important conclusion. 
  The fourth important conclusion which I would like to sum up 
is that the Slovak side repeated what we are saying as well: We 
are extremely interested in preserving the customs union. Those 
few sentences once uttered by somebody on this or the other 
side, the sentences which were in some way interpreted -- 
correctly or not -- in the media, are contrasted by statements 
made by the Slovak prime minister, the Slovak deputy prime 
minister for economic affairs, the finance minister and the 
economy minister -- that is, by the four fundamental 
representatives of the Slovak Republic in this sphere -- and 
expressing, I repeat this, an unequivocal interest in preserving 
the customs union and not providing space for speculations. 
  I think I have warned about the necessity of preventing 
sentences which might be interpreted in different ways from 
leaking to the media. We do not do this and would much 
appreciate the other side not engaging in this. This is, in my 
view, the fourth important conclusion. 
  The fifth conclusion is to take the border issue into the 
implementation phase. This is an important issue. There is an 
exception to the disputed area about which the Slovak side has 
clearly said that their side finds it impossible to make 
concessions -- the issue of the so-called Kasarna -- but 
otherwise it seems possible to conclude all the other issues. I 
think it is good to conclude these things. This would mean 
doing away with yet another problem. 
  The Slovak side says that they simply do not perceive the 
Kasarna issue as one which might be solved by handing the 
territory over to the Czech Republic. The only option is to 
introduce specific conditions in this region, opening a special 
border and roads, introducing a special norm there which would 
make it possible for numerous Czech owners of recreational 
compounds in this area to function normally, and subsequently to 
do the best to meet the needs there. They simply consider it 
impossible to hand over this area. This statement is necessary 
to take into account as a statement by the full-fledged Slovak 
representation. I have heard it and I am taking it into account. 
  We spoke also about property issues. A certain option 
emerged of a different method of registration, transfer of 
debts, perhaps a technical amendment. However, I repeat that it 
is not possible to make a breakthrough in this matter as at 
present, prior to the elections, the Slovak Government does not 
have a mandate to take any radical new step. I simply cannot do 
anything else than to take reality into account. 
  Finally, the last thing, which is not unimportant, is that 
we 
spoke once again about the need to follow up our close 
cooperation -- I would rather call it indirect cooperation -- 
which existed in the past also with the previous government, 
making the maximum effort to support each other whenever it is 
possible as far as foreign policy issues are concerned, where 
our interests are similar, and simply to tend to help each other 
rather than failing to do so. I think this, too, is in our 
mutual interest. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] The Universal Economic Forum ends in Crans 
Montana in Switzerland today. In addition to plenary sessions 
and discussions within sections, bilateral talks also played an 
important role. Our special correspondent Lucie Weissova tells 
us about those in which the Czech delegation was involved. 
  [Weissova] [Czech] Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held talks 
with the host Swiss delegation, from whom he received an 
invitation to pay an official visit to Switzerland. He also 
talked to representatives of the smaller states of the former 
Soviet Union: Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Belarus. He told 
us the following about the contents of those talks: 
  [Begin Klaus recording] What I consider significant is that 
these countries explicitly see the model being effected by the 
Czech Republic as being the model for them to follow. We have 
even firmly agreed that for both Moldova and Georgia we might be 
prepared to send a certain delegation of our experts, who would 
advise them as to the logic of the whole transformation process.

  [Text] The Crans Montana Forum has ended proceedings in 
Switzerland. Here's our reporter Reis Cico: 
  [Cico] A delegation from our country attended the Crans 
Montana Forum in Switzerland. Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, 
who heads the Albanian delegation, took the floor today. In his 
speech Meksi made a summarizing overview of the changes and 
developments in Albania, pointing out achievements in political, 
institutional, legislative, and economic reform. 
  Prime Minister Meksi said that the results achieved in these 
two years of democratic government encourage us to go quicker 
toward the road of transformations and the country's 
democratization. The changes and transformations toward the 
construction of a new democratic society in former socialist 
countries, Meksi stressed, require above all a favorable climate 
of international relations and an increase in technical and 
economic assistance on the part of relevant bodies. 
  Dwelling on Balkan problems, Prime Minister Meksi said that 
Albania thinks that the United Nations and the Western countries 
should contribute more to the establishment and preservation of 
peace in our region. After condemning the aggression in Bosnia, 
Meksi stressed the danger that the spread of the conflict to the 
south of the Balkans would include many regional countries in a 
direct war. Meksi continued to say that Albania considers it 
compulsory to preserve stability in the Balkans and maintains 
that problems should be solved through dialogue, he concluded. 
  All the Crans Montana Forum participants addressed an appeal 
to the Western countries to contribute more to the democratic 
transformations of former socialist countries, considering this 
an investment for Europe.

<F P=106> [Interview with Asen Michkovski, National Assembly deputy </F>
for the Alternative Social-Liberal Party, by Todor Tokin; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Michkovski, unlike most of your 
colleagues in the ASLP [Alternative Social-Liberal Party], you 
have not yet left the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy]. 
  [Michkovski] I am still considering my decision. I think 
there is always time to leave any organization, including a 
parliamentary group. In this case, I am following the old 
Bulgarian proverb: "The quick bitch gives birth to blind pups." 
The main qualities that anyone who calls himself a politician 
in Bulgaria should have are patience and sober thinking. In 
politics I only support pragmatic actions that can really lead 
to something important. I have proved this during the last five 
years. The ASLP, of which I am deputy chairman, also displayed 
its pragmatism, and I hope that this will continue in the future. 
  [Tokin] The ASLP was expelled from the SDS [Union of 
Democratic Forces] because it supported Professor Berov's 
government. Have you any regrets that this happened? 
  [Michkovski] ASLP Chairman Nikolay Vasilev most accurately 
described the ASLP's expulsion from the SDS when he said that 
the SDS is shedding its own brains. All in all, this has been 
confirmed. Prof. Vasilev's definition has even been surpassed by 
the SDS leadership's cretinism. The recent acts of the 
so-called blue coalition can only be described in specialized 
medical literature. Psychopaths, cretins, and people who cannot 
see further than their own noses have dug a grave for the 
coalition, so that it has no importance for Bulgaria's future. 
The actions of Filip Dimitrov, Edvin Sugarev, and other 
individuals with unstable psychological and hormonal conditions 
have succeeded in really turning the SDS into a sect, making 
them people of no importance for the next National Assembly, in 
which they will have 10-12 seats. They have little chance in 
the struggle for power, and they do not even want power. They 
were in power, and at the moment they have a unique opportunity 
to seize it again, but they do not want to. Their only aim is 
to remain eternally in opposition and to guarantee places for 
themselves. 
  These are people with no love for their fatherland. Their 
blind allegiance to the United States or to anyone else, acting 
as if Bulgaria was a satellite, has completely destroyed the 
country's image. They continue to go about abroad defaming 
their native land. In general, these people are bankrupt. 
  [Tokin] Will the ASLP not expel you because of your refusal 
to obey the decision of the ASLP Political Council to leave the 
NSD? 
  [Michkovski] The ASLP is the most democratic structure in 
Bulgaria. Its organizational statute does not provide that its 
decisions are binding on anyone, and this includes the ASLP 
deputies. Furthermore, I have not said that I will not leave the 
NSD, I am simply making use of the democratic provisions of the 
party's statute to follow my democratic convictions. 
  [Tokin] Do you then concur with the reasons given by your 
colleagues who have left the NSD, such as Prof. Nikolay Vasilev 
and Georgi Kostov? 
  [Michkovski] I have absolute respect for the motives of all 
of them, including the individuals whom you mentioned. We 
simply differ in our assessment of the political moment, and 
most of all the political future of such an act. I do not 
consider that any formation that proclaims itself as so-called 
liberals can win the elections in Bulgaria, nor even form part 
of the political spectrum. Bulgaria is a state with a 
totalitarian past, so that here the reforms can only be carried 
out slowly and gradually, and on this subject I myself might 
admit my mistakes. I too was a supporter of the shock therapy, 
but this was about two and a half or three years ago. Now I 
think quite differently. Bulgaria's evolution toward becoming a 
modern state should proceed calmly, without shocks and without 
stigmatizing anyone. 
  [Tokin] What do you think about the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party]? 
  [Michkovski] What the BSP should do, but has not yet done, 
is very simple. It needs public legitimization both within and 
outside the country. It should admit the errors of those whom 
it succeeded and condemn those responsible for bringing the 
country into the present situation, but in no event is anyone 
entitled to strip the BSP of the right to be a legitimate 
political force. I am no supporter of the BSP and cannot be 
one, but, objectively considered, things show that the Bulgarian 
Socialists have a correct strategy and, all in all, it is only a 
question of time before they assume power. In general, I think 
that in the next parliamentary elections, whenever they take 
place, a left-of-center coalition will really sweep away 
everything else from the Bulgarian political scene. 
  [Tokin] Does the ASLP have a place in this coalition? 
  [Michkovski] This I am not sure about. In the final event, 
the congress is the body that can define our political allies, 
coalitions, and so on. I believe that social liberalism has a 
place in such a coalition, everything is a question of how one 
weighs things up. However, this should never be regarded as an 
act of petition. The ASLP is the most intelligent political 
formation and it has proved this during the last three years: 
Starting with an organization consisting of a group of 28 
people, it fought its way to power; it has taken part in power 
for two and a half years, and I think that it will remain a fact 
in the government of the country for a long time to come. 
  [Tokin] Will you personally continue to support the 
government? 
  [Michkovski] I personally support only those of the 
government's actions that relate to solving national problems, 
such as the efforts to finalize the settlement with the creditor 
banks of the London Club. I also support all actions by any 
department of the Bulgarian Government that are aimed at 
privatization and increasing the proportion of private ownership 
in the country. I support any actions by the government that 
encourage the development of Bulgarian national capital and 
create successful Bulgarian businessmen. With the same proviso, 
I also support what the government is doing to forge an 
independent Bulgarian foreign policy. 
  [Tokin] Does the NSD have a future? 
  [Michkovski] It never has been a political formation, merely 
a parliamentary alliance created to support sensible 
legislation, nothing more. Politically speaking, the NSD has 
never had any particular chances, and the same is true of the 
future. Only the strong and emerging party formations have a 
future. 
  [Tokin] Your colleagues who left the NSD claim that one more 
government may be formed within the term of this parliament. Do 
you share this view? 
  [Michkovski] I am skeptical. The only possibility is an SDS 
government, but the degree of cretinism within the SDS 
leadership has gone beyond all normal bounds. The Berov 
government is the last government that this parliament will 
have. I believe that no one in the country really wants 
elections, and I do not think they will be held this autumn. 
However strange it may seem, Prof. Berov's weak government will 
turn out to be quite tough and will last until the end of 1994. 
  [Tokin] A Sofia daily called you "the terminator." How do 
you react to this description? 
  [Michkovski] I can only express gratitude for such an 
assessment, but unfortunately my own view is different. I am a 
calm and normal person with no claims of being a terminator.

  [Text] President Arapd Goncz is of the view that the aim of 
the coalition talks between the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] 
and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] is national 
reconciliation. The president of the Republic gave an interview 
to Kossuth Radio just before our program. Regarding the 
elections, the head of state said that they took place in an 
orderly manner and that the people voted for changes. 
  [Goncz] ``The election result is obvious. The country's 
political will is clearly revealed. It cannot be questioned; 
its legality cannot be questioned. If we wish to analyze the 
reasons, such as whether the country voted for or against 
something, the debate on this will probably last for a while. 
It is a difficult test of conscience for everybody. 
  ``The country wanted modernization, progress. It wanted to 
move toward security of existence. I am convinced that the 
country wanted a change in style, which is by all means positive. 
  ``The country disliked something very much. I think that the 
country did not like the style, because we consequently forgot, 
or were inclined to forget, that the bourgeois mentality of the 
country had progressed, under the surface, even during the 40 
years of communist rule in spite of their intentions. So a 
society with a rather bourgeois and secular character came into 
existence, and its system of values in essence differed from the 
system of values and symbols of the previous four years. It can 
be understood that all the parties are currently battling with 
the problem of self-definition. 
  ``The SZDSZ, as the second winner in my opinion, must decide 
whether to join a coalition or not. And the greatest winner, 
the MSZP, must clarify how much it will dare and how much it 
will have to accept from its past and how much it can reject 
from its past, and with whom and to what extent it can become a 
modern social democratic party within the four-year cycle.'' 
  [Announcer] Regarding his talks with the six parties in 
parliament, Arpad Goncz said that in his view not all of the 
organizations have yet managed to find a new identity. 
  [Goncz] "I saw the intention to be in the opposition and to 
face the facts. [sentence as heard] I saw the difficulty of 
facing the facts, and in some cases I saw the intention of 
escaping from reality." 
  [Announcer] The head of state also evaluated the coalition 
talks up to now. 
  [Goncz] "National reconciliation is definitely an aim. A 
Hungarian is not another Hungarian's enemy. If we do not try to 
keep selecting who is and who is not Hungarian, then I think 
there will be room for everybody here, and it is in our commom 
interest to build the country for everyone's benefit." 
  [Announcer] Arpad Goncz described the fact that Socialist 
Party Chairman Gyula Horn laid a wreath together with Erzsebet 
Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, as one of the first signs of 
national reconciliation. 
  [Goncz] "If Gyula Horn wanted to pay tribute and express 
feelings of this kind, then with the gesture of laying a wreath 
at the symbolic grave of the 1956-ers and at the grave of Imre 
Nagy, together with Erzsebet Nagy, daughter of Imre Nagy, he 
simply expressed something without words." 
  [Announcer] In conclusion, Arpad Goncz cautioned against the 
new goverment laying its hands on the press because, according 
to the president, this affair could explode at any time.

  [Text] According to the outgoing prime minister, the 
government's experiences of the past four years will be very 
much missed in the coming period. Speaking on the "Sunday 
Newspaper" radio program, Peter Boross expressed the view that 
the coalition now being formed is not unified. At the same 
time, the outgoing head of government also stressed that it is 
in interest both of the country and of the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum that a successful government be created. 
  He said also that this year there was a turnabout in the 
economy. Inflation and unemployment fell and productivity 
improved. At the same time, he believes that a wrong assessment 
was made at the beginning of the system change in the region 
about how much time is needed for people to become more 
satisfied with their lives. According to Peter Boross, this 
requires 10-15 years. 
  The outgoing prime minister believes that a government which 
does not take up the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the 
borders and does not make a stand in their interest does not 
deserve the trust of the Hungarian people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, president of the National </F>
Peasant Christian-Democratic Party, by Roxana Badralexi; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Coposu, why do we all have the 
feeling that everything ends in smoke? 
  [Coposu] Generally Romanians are fatalistic people and 
display this mood when they see that their sustained and 
repeated efforts yield no concrete results. For four years, 
people have been waiting for changes for the better, but we are 
moving from bad to worse. Thus, two groups of people take 
shape: some vindicative ones who are building up an indignation 
that is very dangerous for social stability, and another group 
which includes people who become apathetic and embrace the 
fatalistic theory that nothing can be changed anyway. This 
second group was the reason for the large number of expatriates, 
who are, unfortunately, mainly young people. One exclamation 
that one can hear more and more often: It was much better in 
Ceausescu's time.... is also justified. When you compare the 
zero prospects in the time of the Vacaroiu government with a 
situation of oppression that nevertheless ensured a minimum of 
misery, and when the miserable life was supplemented through 
theft, the options are in favor of the former regime. But let 
us not forget that there are also people who lived before the 
Communists.... 
<H5>  Under Current Conditions Except for the Constitutional </H5>
Monarchy, Nobody Is Capable of Polarizing the Trust of the Public 
  [Badralexi] Most of the disappointed people look with 
resignation toward the opposition. In this context, your recent 
public declaration regarding the monarchy shocked many people. 
Why have you made this statement now? 
  [Coposu] I believe that principles cannot be negotiated. 
The 45 years of communism imprinted in the mind of people the 
complex of mistrust. Two generations that were born and raised 
in the communist regime were instructed under the sign of lies. 
Those people knew that you have to think in one way and express 
yourself in another way. This complex still persists today. 
There are telling examples of this in parliament. The 
president, who affirms that he has embarked on the path of 
democracy, does not give up his Marxist-Leninist concepts. I, 
contrary to this group of people, had the luck to be in jail 
while the population of the country was practicing the complex 
of mistrust. I did not adopt it and I believe that the duty of 
a person who is responsible for a certain political situation 
must be sincere and firmly affirm his principles, without 
resorting to petty calculations about the opportuneness of a 
certain attitude. I was surprised by the explosion of 
commentaries in connection with my statement regarding the 
monarchy. I said that our party voted against the current 
Constitution and that, as long as it is in force, we are 
duty-bound to respect it, but that nobody can stop us to improve 
it and bring it up to the level of people's expectations. The 
modification of the Constitution can also mean a change of the 
constitutional form. We believe that the democratic form that is 
most suitable for the difficult circumstances that our country 
is currently facing is the restoration of constitutional 
monarchy. 
  [Badralexi] In your case, can we talk about a historic 
nostalgia.... 
  [Coposu] There is no nostalgia here whatsoever. I have 
strictly pragmatic arguments. They have no connection with any 
sentimental or romantic feelings that some people have. My 
arguments are not based on the desire to have royal continuity 
or to connect the series of rulers who were at the helm of the 
Romanian Principalities with the royalty that modernized 
Romania. However, under the current circumstances, there is 
nobody capable of polarizing the trust of the public and of 
attracting the Romanian people to make the necessary efforts, 
apart from the constitutional monarch. We have never concealed 
the fact that we are dissatisfied with the current Constitution. 
We have never concealed the fact that when the electorate is 
going to empower us with the levers of power, we are going to 
improve this Constitution. We have never concealed our 
adherence to the principles of constitutional-monarchy. 
Therefore, I do not understand Adrian Nastase's surprise at my 
statements, as if I had said something special or something new. 
He forgets that when I was next to him, in front of millions of 
television-watching people, I affirmed the same thing! 
<H5>  I Believe That We Are Duty-Bound To Direct the Public </H5>
  [Coposu] In the same way that I cannot contest his devotion 
to the president, Mr. Nastase has not got the right either to 
show surprise at my option, which is not made in any personal 
interest, but in the interest of my country. The only thing 
this pretended stupor might do is to assist a possible 
diversion. As far as I am concerned, the laws of the country 
and democracy give me the right to present my viewpoint. More 
than that, I believe that I am duty-bound to prevent the options 
of the public and to direct it toward concrete objectives that 
are useful to the nation and the future of the country. I have 
learned from the results of current opinion polls that no more 
than 30 percent of the electorate favors monarchy. Why? This 
is the result of the job that the Communists carried out for 
almost half a century. 
  The disinformation "divisions" of the Communists, which are 
still in good shape today, if not even in better shape than 
ever, are operating through the dissemination of lies. They 
retain those lies that are meant to be picked up by the public 
and abandon the others. We cannot afford to adopt such methods 
and that was one of the reasons why we lost votes in the last 
elections. Because we did not come up with petty lies. To say 
that the restoration of monarchy means to take the land away 
from peasants is an aberration and it is unacceptable that such 
an idea can be born in the mind of some people who have 
political responsibilities. 
  [Badralexi] You probably understand that, for the younger 
generations who have no idea what monarchy in fact means, such 
slogans as "The King and the Homeland" are not sufficient. Why 
doesn't a monarchist campaign include the information, for 
example, on who gave land to peasants? 
  [Coposu] King Ferdinand and King Mihai, who else?! Who took 
away the land from peasants?! The Communist Party! I do not 
throw responsibilities at Mr. Iliescu, who -- at that time -- 
was only minister of youth or first secretary. But there is no 
doubt that all the nomenclatura of that time and of today agreed 
with taking the land away from peasants. To come now and claim 
that the opposition took away the land and, as a matter of fact, 
that Communists who are currently ruling the country returned it 
to peasants is a monstrosity! But let me return to what you 
were saying before. I have to tell you that there has not been 
a monarchist campaign. 
  [Badralexi] But why should there not be such a campaign? 
  [Coposu] In this case, I have to admit that the opposition 
could have made such a campaign. It did not do so. Why?! 
Because the Romanians do not know their own history. As long 
as we cannot find a handful of historians who can rehabilitate 
the truth, at least for the interwar period and the communist 
period, the world will remain with information shrewdly supplied 
at the time of communist domination. Thus, it is useless to 
raise issues that provoke surprise. If you talk to the young 
people who were born after 1945 about the institution of 
monarchy, they ask you what that is. As if Romania, which has 
never been a republic, has never been anything else, except for 
a republic!! Today Romania's history is being taught only up to 
the time of the end of World War I. Is that not convincing?! 
  [Badralexi] However, in your capacity as a politician, how 
would you plead for the restoration of the monarchy? 
  [Coposu] The constitutional monarch does not govern, but 
rule. This cannot be said about a president, who represents a 
political formation and who, although he is duty-bound to be 
equidistant, nevertheless remains the slave of the party that 
promoted him. Thus, instead of a person with a certain 
political orientation who is incapable of being independent in 
his judgment, we would have a neutral referee, who is not 
involved in political trouble, and for whom all Romanian 
citizens are equal. The monarch would have the capability to 
notice the serious moments in history and would not act the way 
a president who is faithful to a party acts, that is, a 
president who is clinging to the prolongation of governmental 
agony. 
<H5>  It Does Not Matter To Me What the Name of the Monarch Is. I </H5>
Plead for Him as an Institution! 
  [Badralexi] Are you referring to any president? 
  [Coposu] I am talking about the situation in Romania. There 
is no doubt that in advanced democracies it is possible that a 
president might be above any suspicion and does not ignore the 
will of the people. 
  [Badralexi] Let us try to speculate on something. We are 
talking about King Mihai, a historical personality who has been 
acquitted, from a moral viewpoint, by the history that has not 
yet been written in school books. I am referring to you and to 
the other political leaders in Romania. Thus, do you believe 
that if King Mihai, installed on Romania's throne, would be 
faced with a situation where he would have to mediate in a 
dispute between you and, let us say, Oliviu Gherman, might he 
take your side? 
  [Coposu] A constitutional king cannot take one side or the 
other. Apart from that, we are not talking about a dispute 
between myself and Mr. Gherman. Moreover, if all the FDSN 
[Democratic National Salvation Front, former name of the ruling 
party, PDSR] -- we call the ruling party by a feminine name -- 
would include only "Ghermans," I do not believe that the 
situation would have reached the current troubled extent. 
Unfortunately, Mr. Gherman, whom I even deplore, endures the 
pressure of cripto-Communists in his own party. But let us 
become serious. I am not talking about King Mihai or about 
myself. I am saying it only in brackets, that King Mihai, at a 
very early age, displayed balance, serious judgment, and a love 
of the homeland. But this was only in brackets. Now, I am 
talking about an institution. I believe that, for quite a long 
time from now, the constitutional monarchy is indispensable and 
is the only one that can ensure a democratic regime in Romania. 
  [Badralexi] On what are you basing your ideas when you plead 
for this cause? 
  [Coposu] The truth will emerge eventually, I am sure of it. 
However, there is an element that, I do not know why, is 
overlooked here: The famous institution that is the Romanian 
people has never made a mistake. Not even in crucial moments 
when it was kept under control by force or by lies. The 
Romanian people has a remarkable political intuition and we rely 
on it. There is a saying that the pitcher goes so often to the 
well that at last it breaks, and this is true. I count on early 
elections for next spring and then the institution I was talking 
about will prove itself. 

<H5>    The Western Policy Is a Policy of Opportunity </H5>
  [Badralexi] Can we or should we count on international 
support in any way? 
  [Coposu] No, we cannot, and we have no right to do so. We 
have to reach the right path that we have to follow alone. It 
is true that the appearances are discouraging. Recently, I was 
again surprised by President Iliescu's behavior. It is true 
that I should be used to any paradox by now. However, I never 
cease to be surprised at certain behavior. Recently, President 
Iliescu promulgated the law on agricultural taxes. I nurtured a 
faint hope that ultimately Iliescu, who pretends to be a lover 
of the peasants, would not agree to sign such an aberrant law 
that puts a tax on the amount of land and not on income. 
Moreover, I can even see his picture in the newspaper, holding 
the arms of peasant women who are happy that a law has been 
voted in that forces them to pay taxes on a nonexistent income. 
Everything that is happening around me seems to belong to the 
world of fantasy. But, nevertheless, I am optimistic. 
  [Badralexi] Even lately, we constantly see representatives 
of the civilized world coming to our country and shaking hands 
with the current rulers, pleased with the "achievements" of the 
past years. Doesn't it seem that the West has accepted them? 
  [Coposu] The policy promoted by the West is a policy of 
opportunity. It is true that Romania represents a great 
geopolitical interest, especially in the current period. Thus, 
it is logical that the West tries to promote stability here in 
our country. 
  [Badralexi] However, as a witness of historic events, aren't 
you a little afraid? 
  [Coposu] ....Certainly, sometimes I think that the adventure 
of Western-communist relations that existed in the past might be 
repeated. Nevertheless I have to repeat it: I am an optimist. 
I believe that it is a passing stage that is nearing the end. 
Still, a force that is capable of destroying a nation like ours 
has not been born yet. Soon we will live a normal life.

<F P=106> [Article by Mihai Fabian] </F>
  [Text] In an unmistakable manner, Corneliu Coposu, 
president of the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic 
Party] is making efforts -- as George Padure's advertisement 
might say -- to make the life of each Romanian "a bit better." 
The fact that he starts from presenting his own person, with 
his (social) classmates, or with his party colleagues, and that 
he does not show the least interest in the life of the majority 
of the people is his own business. However, this attitude 
cannot leave indifferent those many who are threatened from two 
sides at once. One side is represented by the fact that, to 
reach his goal -- the one that he has clearly and openly 
declared, namely, to bring back former King Mihai to the throne 
-- Coposu and "his group" will do all they can to provoke early 
elections. And if they win those elections (that is what he 
believes) the Constitution can be changed and the ex-king, who 
is exiled to Versoix, will be able to return to Romania, and 
might even drive under the Arc de Triomphe in a jeep similar to 
the one that U.S. General Patton was driving during the 
debarkation in Normandy... 
  It is obvious that early elections can be provoked only by a 
crisis. But, we are quite aware of what a crisis means and we 
are sort of fed up with it. However, the change of the 
Constitution will have to have the approval of the electorate. 
This is the only note of optimism (for us) in the tenebrous 
threats voiced by the PNTCD leader; it is difficult to assume 
that the Romanian people, who spoke out for the Republic in 
1991, would willingly change their options in 1995 on the 
alleged ground that there is no leader -- certainly except for 
the ex-monarch -- who can currently polarize the sympathy of the 
electorate, as Coposu affirms. It is true that a great part of 
the electorate does not know what the monarchy meant and might 
be seduced by the much-publicized slogans according to which the 
monarch would "save" Romania. 
  The other side -- and unfortunately for Coposu, this side is 
much larger -- knows what the ex-monarch really meant for our 
country. Thus, as far as the popular vote (we cannot help it, 
the expression defines the reality) is concerned, it cannot be 
really changed. 
  The more so since, while revealing such an obvious lack of 
competence that for a moment we almost thought that we are 
facing a trick that we cannot figure out, Coposu also threatens 
us, apart from reinstating the monarchy, with the implementation 
of the much-publicized integral restitution of property 
(restitutio in integrum). This means that such an extraordinary 
polarization will take place in Romanian society, and will 
result in such a gap between the rich (a few) and the poor (the 
majority) that not even the liberals, who are known for having a 
cure to all ailments, will be able to fill it up. 
  The integral restitution of all the goods that in one way or 
another have become state property, usually through violation of 
the law, would mean repairing an error by committing a much 
greater error. We are not referring only to a few million 
tenants who will see themselves thrown out in the streets, and 
peasants who will return to the state of serfdom, although 
nobody is entitled to play with the fate of these people. We 
are talking about the complete destruction of the work carried 
out by millions of Romanians for scores of years, who created 
factories out of small workshops, blocks of flats on empty lots 
that were left untended, and holiday resorts at the seaside or 
at the mountain, in one word a patrimony for which we have all 
made great efforts, but less those who, willingly or 
unwillingly, stayed far from the homeland and who -- when 
Coposu's dream comes true -- will not hesitate to come and claim 
their properties. 
  The distinguished PNTCD president seems not to have taken 
all 
this into consideration. Moreover, he believes in a favorable 
response to the intentions he clearly expressed: the restoration 
of the monarchy and "restitutio in integrum." The insistence he 
has displayed to fulfill this "credo" makes us believe that the 
PNTCD leader wishes no longer to be part of the parliamentary 
opposition. Maybe he finds the ... street more comfortable. In 
any event, by militating for the return of big lands to past 
landowners or their current successors, Coposu has proved again 
-- as if it was still necessary -- how "close" he is to the soul 
of these people whom we call peasants and through whose efforts 
Romania has always managed to get out of any impasse. Coposu 
added the "chance" of his unequivocal speech to the common sense 
of this peasant, who has always known whom his friends are. His 
speech will be "sanctioned" accordingly, even if it will not 
happen so soon. As far as the road from Republic to monarchy is 
concerned, we do not even bother to try to convince Coposu that 
for the immense majority of Romanians this is inconceivable. 
But one should grant him what is rightfully his! That is, we 
must recognize Coposu's "merit" and make thinner with every 
passing declaration, like the aforementioned one, the not very 
large group of his own camp. Through this monarchist zeal, 
Coposu is the best advertiser of the form of government that 
currently prevails in our country, that is, the Republic. In 
other words, Coposu is campaigning for the Republic without 
being aware of it...

<F P=106> [Article by Irina Zidaru: "Due to the Fact That No </F>
Compromise Could Be Reached, the Expression `Elimination of the 
Consequences of Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact' Will Be Eliminated From 
the Future Romanian-Russian Treaty"] 
  [Text] Mircea Geoana, spokesman for the Romanian Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, referring to the renegotiation of the basic 
Romanian-Russian political treaty at a recent news conference, 
said: "We continue to have differences in approaching the issue 
of including in the future Romanian-Russian treaty certain 
provisions that would properly assess all those events that had 
a negative impact on Romanian-Soviet relations." As is known, 
negotiations were held on 1-3 June between representatives of 
the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  The main controversial point between the two delegations is 
the formula "to eliminate the consequences of the 
Ribbentrop-Molotov pact" proposed by the Romanian side and 
rejected by the Russian side. "We have not reached any formula 
of compromise. We are still far from solutions," as Dumitru 
Ceausu, head of the Romanian delegation and director of the 
directorate in charge of judicial issues and treaties, told us. 
We remind our readers that the normalization of relations with 
Russia and the conclusion of a basic treaty were the issues 
raised by Ambassador Richard Schifler and General George A. 
Joulwan during their recent talks with Romanian authorities in 
Bucharest. The next round of talks will take place in Bucharest 
in September.

Ministry of National Defense will organize the second stage of 
testing personnel in these military units. On the basis of 
certain regulations of the Defense Ministry, the personnel in 
the military commands will have to take a number of exams. 
These exams are organized directly by the General Staff and are 
part of the process of transforming and restructuring the Army. 
  In accordance with the importance, area, and size of the 
commands, it is possible that the number of personnel will be 
cut by a maximum of 15 percent. The first stage of testing 
personnel took place in the second half of May at a local level. 
At the level of the entire ministry, a maximum 20-percent cut 
in personnel is envisaged in territorial and central structures. 
The most important territorial commands of the Ministry of 
National Defense are in Bucharest, Bacau, Cluj, and Drobeta 
Turnu Severin.

  [Excerpts] A formal rally was held in Varazdin this morning 
on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of organized 
fire-fighting in Croatia. Franjo Tudjman, president of the 
Republic of Croatia, spoke at the rally. Zlatko Kuretic reports: 
  [Kuretic] [passage omitted] After introductory speeches by 
the host and Franjo Greguric, the president of the Croatian Fire 
Brigade Association, the rally was addressed by President Franjo 
Tudjman. He expressed gratitude to the Croatian firemen for 
their contribution in the patriotic war. Speaking about the 
firemen's parade in Varazdin, he also said: 
  [Begin Tudjman recording] This parade speaks about the unity 
of all parts of Croatia, of all Croatian counties, about the 
unity that we must nurture in all areas because we have 
established a single, independent, sovereign, and 
internationally recognized Croatian state. There are still 
people in the world who cannot reconcile themselves to this 
fact. Our Croatia has become, however, not just internationally 
recognized, but our sovereign and independent Croatia also has 
powerful allies and friends, including, in the first place, the 
United States, the most powerful world superpower in one part of 
the world, and also our friend China, another world power, in 
the other part of the world. 
  We have good relations with the European Union and friendly 
relations with most of the European and other countries in the 
world. Croatia's international status is such that we can 
devote ourselves to carrying out other tasks before us: the 
liberation of the occupied parts of Croatian and the development 
of the federation and the confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
From then on, we can devote ourselves in peace to economic and 
cultural development and to the tasks our government is faced 
with. 
  In both the economic and political fields, we have achieved 
not just surprising results, but a miracle that the world is 
admiring. We have curbed inflation. We have created conditions 
for the introduction of a new Croatian currency that will be 
stable because our efforts and our sweat and blood are in our 
hands and will no longer go to foreign capitals. All our sweat 
and blood will be in the interests of Croatian men, Croatian 
people, and the Croatian state. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Zagreb, June 17 (TANJUG) -- The chief Croatian 
negotiator for the postponed talks between the Republic of Serb 
Krajina and Croatia, Hrvoje Sarinic, has outlined a number of 
issues standing in the way of the talks in addition to the 
dispute over press accreditation. 
  Sarinic said he was not satisfied with items the Serbs had 
included in the agenda of the talks. He also objected to 
Krajina's insistence on lifting United Nations Resolution 820, a 
move he said would make Krajina completely independent. 
  Sarinic said the Serb side was interested in discussing 
partial issues, such as the restoration of water supplies, while 
Croatia wanted to negotiate not only economic, but also 
political issues. He said the problem of Krajina-Croatia 
telephone connections was politically important, reiterating 
Croatia's demand that telephone numbers in Krajina bear the same 
area code as Croatia. 
  The Croatian reaction to the cancellation of talks between 
the Krajina and Croatia indicates that Croatia's demands for 
increasing the press quota for Croatian reporters was merely a 
tactic to avoid holding the talks at all. 
  The talks scheduled to take place in Plitvice were cancelled 
when Krajina permitted Croatia to bring only the same number of 
reporters to the talks as the Serb side had been allowed at the 
Zagreb talks in March. The Krajina Serbs were allowed to bring 
two reporters to the earlier talks. 
  Responding to a Serb request that Croatia pay up on the 
outstanding pensions due to Serb retirees now living in Krajina, 
Sarinic rejected Serb estimates of 57,000 such retirees, saying 
the total was only 34,000. Sarinic also said Croatia would only 
pay the smaller number of pensioners in the new Croatian kuna 
currency unit. The kuna was first introduced as Croatia's 
currency in the fascist independent state of Croatia, a 
Nazi-sponsored puppet state that existed only during World War 
II. The Croatian Government reintroduced the kuna last month. 
  The Republic of Serb Krajina was established in 1991 on Serb 
ancestral lands in Croatia after Croatia seceded from the former 
Yugoslav federation. Krajina was placed under United Nations 
protection in 1992 and has since suffered three military 
offensives from Croatia. International conference on former 
Yugoslavia representatives Kai Eide and Geerd Ahrens have 
pledged their assistance in trying to resume the stalled 
Krajina-Croatia talks.

<F P=106> [M. Zurovac report: "We Reject Blackmail"] </F>
  [Text] The talks between the delegations of the Republic 
of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and Croatia that were supposed to be 
held in Plitvice were postponed and it is still uncertain as to 
whether they are going to be held at all. The Croatian 
delegation had not arrived by last night. Following this 
(un)expected course of events, RSK President Milan Martic has 
stated for VECERNJE NOVOSTI the following: 
  "The venue is not contentious. We have demonstrated maximum 
cooperativeness and flexibility, something Croatia had obviously 
not counted on. Their behavior and request for support from the 
international community and allies confirm that they were caught 
by surprise and that they do not want to come to Plitvice. They 
are evidently not in the mood to negotiate, as they are 
fervently seeking the help of their allies in order again to 
accuse the Serbian side and show that the war option is 
unavoidable." 
<H5>  Substantive Obstacles </H5>
  "We are patiently waiting," Martic said, "because there is 
no 
alternative to the peaceful settlement of the problem. Croatia 
has found an 'excuse' in journalists and resorted to ultimatums, 
demanding their sponsors to exert pressure on us. We will not 
accept any ultimatums. We enjoy the support of our assembly, 
government, and the RSK people." 
  In response to the question whether the talks would resume 
in 
the course of the day, Martic said: 
  "As far as we are concerned, they could resume. I have sent 
a written message to David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg with 
regard to the message sent to the RSK leadership by Enrique 
Agillar, coordinator of the civil sector. The message, which 
had allegedly been sent by Owen and Stoltenberg, but not signed 
by them, refers to procedural and substantive obstacles to the 
negotiations in Plitvice. However, whether they are procedural 
or substantive, the consequences of the message are absolutely 
political. 
  "Croatia was not sent a message with the identical content. 
The message states that the answer regarding the acceptance or 
rejection of the talks be sent via Agillar in Knin. We do not 
believe that Croatia will send its reply to Geneva via Knin, 
which means that the Croatian side was sent a different message 
or not sent one at all." 
<H5>  Wrong Order </H5>
  Martic also claims that the agreement that the agenda be set 
at the very beginning of talks had not been respected. Instead, 
the message sent to the RSK already contained the priority 
issues that should be discussed. The first three of the total 
of five issues were exclusively in the interest of Croatia (a 
set of measures concerning the supply of electric power and 
water, high voltage network, and oil pipes). The RSK was thus 
put in an unequal position. Point 5, concerning UN Security 
Council Resolution 820, makes it clear that the blockade of the 
RSK is not going to be lifted, but only perhaps gradually 
moderated. In other words, the RSK would be enabled to trade 
within Croatia. 
  "The agreement that one Croat journalist and one photo 
reporter be present in Plitvice was not respected either," 
Martic said. "Instead, the RSK was given the ultimatum to allow 
five journalists in. The rescheduling of the start of the 
meeting for 1600 [1400 GMT] suggests that the Croatian 
delegation wanted to spend the night at Plitvice, which 
contravenes previous agreements. The message also says that a 
delegation could include more than five members, which was the 
original maximum. The agreement that the delegations' cost 
would be borne by the international conference on the former 
SFRY was also annulled and replaced with a clause that the costs 
would be shared by the two delegations. It is totally incorrect 
to make the arrival of Owen and Stoltenberg in Knin conditional 
on the agreement that the next round of talks be held on 30 June. 
  "At the same time, Croatian politicians' public speeches and 
the media campaign have disturbed the atmosphere concerning the 
negotiations to the extent that they have become impossible to 
hold. The inflexible statements by Hrvoje Sarinic [chief 
Croatian negotiator] have caused much disturbance among the 
Serbian people in Krajina, who do not like anyone setting them 
conditions. 
  "The negotiations are of interest for both countries," 
Martic 
said at the end, "and we believe that the cochairmen of the 
peace conference will invest extra effort to convince the 
Croatian side of the necessity of continuing the dialogue."

<F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister of the </F>
republic of Serb Krajina, by Predrag Sarac; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Sarac] The continuation of the negotiations on 
economic cooperation between the Republic of Serbian Krajina 
[RSK] and Croatia has attracted much attention. Even though 
everything was ready for the continuation of the negotiations in 
Krajina and in Plitvice, the failure by the Croatian delegation 
to turn up has practically blocked the negotiating process. 
What was in fact happening during the consultations shortly 
before the talks were supposed to take place? There were plenty 
of comments, but we sought the answer from Borislav Mikelic, 
head of the government and the Krajina negotiating delegation. 
  [Mikelic] Their rejection of the continuation of the 
negotiations and failure to come to Plitvice, because we had 
allegedly not agreed to allow five journalists to come here, is 
a transparent thing and cannot be the reason as to why there are 
no negotiations. 
  It appears to me that the central thing in all this is that 
Sarinic [chief Croatian negotiator] had realized that he would 
not be the host in Plitvice, but us, that he would not be able 
to promote himself in Plitvice, and that he would not be able to 
manifest what he wants, that he would be under the completely 
equal conditions, like us. He had realized that, in the 
presence of the international community, the talks would be held 
in the way they should, that there would be no pressure, nor 
agreements prepared in advance according to which the Serbs 
would allow this and that, without at the same time seeing what 
is behind this. 
  [Sarac] What should be done next? Will the negotiations 
continue? 
  [Mikelic] In our view, everything that we had prepared, the 
platform that had been prepared by our government, we are 
prepared to continue the talks tomorrow. We have therefore not 
disrupted the talks. We have not given up the negotiations. We 
were not the cause of the talks' failure either. Those who did 
not come to Plitvice, because of the journalists, I think that 
they are responsible for not coming to Plitvice.

  [Text] Knin, 19 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Republic of Serb 
Krajina [RSK] is always prepared for talks with the Croatian 
side, RSK President Milan Martic told a TANJUG correspondent. 
"We can talk at any time anywhere in Krajina," he added. "We 
know we are a state and nothing can make us change our mind. We 
are prepared to meet them in Plitvice whenever they want." 
  Expressing the willingness to resume talks, Martic doubted 
at 
the same time whether the Croatian side will accept it, because 
"Krajina will remain adamant in its stand that one cannot go 
below what is known as reciprocity and equal terms." 
  Martic claimed that the latest talks in Plitvice failed 
because they did not suit Croatia's needs and that journalists 
were used only as a pretext. "They do not suit Croatia's needs, 
the Croats are even prepared to sacrifice their own people at 
the expense of a war option," the RSK president claimed. "They 
were brought into this situation because we agreed to the talks 
and they had obviously not counted on it." 
  Martic said that in Geneva the Croats asked that the meeting 
be held anywhere in "Croatia, including the RSK." Hence their 
surprise when we agreed to the talks in Plitvice, because they 
counted on the Serbian side's refusal. In this way they would 
have precipitated the war and found international sponsors for 
this attempt. 
  "We really wanted to discuss economic issues, primarily the 
opening of communication lines. But, we are determined about 
one thing -- we cannot talk about it unless [UN] Security 
Council Resolution No. 820 is abolished." 
  According to Martic, there are many issues to discuss. The 
RSK will ask to be allowed to use the ports of Zadar and 
Rovanjska and for access to Europe through Croatian territory, 
that is, through Italy, Slovenia, Austria, and Hungary. "In 
exchange for that, we would let them use our communications and, 
of course, we are ready to give water to Bigrad and Zadar, but 
it seems that this does not suit Tudjman and his policy," Martic 
says. 
  Martic believes Tudjman does not care much for the Croats in 
Dalmatia. "If we were pounding Zagreb he would be concerned, 
but the fact that Zadar has no water supply is in fact good for 
him because he uses it to keep people under control and motivate 
them to fight against us." 
  Milan Martic says the Croatian leaders are to blame for the 
lack of a regular water supply in Biograd and Zadar because they 
are refusing to hold talks. "Everything they are doing is 
leading toward the war option, and they will surely strike," he 
said. "At the moment they are prevented by huge rifts in the 
political and military leaderships, but the opposition is 
forcing Tudjman to go to war." 
  "Their parliament is nonexistent. It is not functioning. 
Everyone is working to undermine it, and Tudjman can use that 
situation to arrest all his opponents. This is why he needs an 
attack on Krajina," Martic said in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jakovcic, leader of the Istrian </F>
Democratic Assembly, by Ingrid Steiner; place and date not 
given: "Every Time New Borders Were Drawn Here, a Desert 
Remained Behind"] 
  [Text] [Steiner] What would autonomy mean for Istria? 
  [Jakovcic] It would mean more financial independence for us 
and more powers at the provincial level. At the moment Croatia 
is a super-centralized state, all power is in President 
Tudjman's hands. We are not even permitted to manage the tourism 
advertisements for Istria. We also do not have any influence on 
the top echelons of our companies. In no case, however, would 
autonomy mean separation from Croatia. We want full solidarity 
with the Republic of Croatia. 
  [Steiner] Thus, changes of the borders are out of the 
question? 
  [Jakovcic] Every time new borders were drawn in our region, 
this ended in a drama. We do not want any new tragedies. The 
national borders between Italy, Slovenia, and Croatia are to 
remain as they are. However, it is not logical that Istria is 
cut in two halves so sharply and that the authorities are 
managing the border checks so painstakingly. The border should 
be overcome but not changed. 
  [Steiner] Must Istria again fear territorial claims by 
Italy's extreme right? 
  [Jakovcic] Istria is not Italian. Romans, Slavs, and 
Teutons always met here. And today, too, Italians, Croats, 
Serbs, and Albanians live here together. Even though the Croats 
are the majority, we support our minorities absolutely. We have 
learned our lessons from history: from the expulsion of the 
Croats by the Italian fascists, from the expulsion of the 
Italians from communist Yugoslavia. What remained behind always 
were civilizational deserts. 
  [Steiner] What is Istria's attitude toward a return of the 
expelled Italians? 
  [Jakovcic] If Croatia wants to join Europe, a solution must 
be found so that the Italians can buy back their former land. 
This problem must be dealt with pragmatically and must not be 
politicized. We know that the people who lived here want to 
return. But we do not want to accept new tragedies.

  [Text] The parliamentary opposition is blaming the ruling 
HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] for the breakdown in inter-party 
negotiations. It sees a way out of the deadlock in a settlement 
before the next assembly session, and it predicts early 
elections. This is a brief summary of a news conference held 
today by the HSLS [Croatian Social Liberal Party], the HNS 
[Croatian People's Party], the HSS [Croatian Peasants' Party], 
the SDP [Social Democratic Party], the HND [Croatian Independent 
Democrats] and the IDS [Istrian Democratic Assembly]. Jasnka 
Dudic reporting: 
  [Dudic] Opposition representatives denied the HDZ's claims 
that the opposition was less cooperative yesterday than usual 
and said that the HDZ was inflexible and unwilling to accept any 
compromise. They stressed that the opposition had decided not to 
put forward any candidates for the position of vice-presidents, 
suggested that it would abandon the issue of legality, but 
demanded that it be allowed to vote on the dismissal and 
election of the president of the assembly. Since this was 
rejected, we came to a deadlock, Ivica Racan [SDP chairman] said 
and announced a meeting of the opposition for Monday [20 June]. 
  [Begin Racan recording] At the meeting we will discuss the 
possibility of the opposition offering resignations from all its 
positions in the Croatian Assembly. We will also decide in 
which way we will take part in the further work of the assembly, 
but I do not think that we will attend the sessions scheduled 
for Tuesday. [end recording] 
  [Dudic] The opposition believes that the situation in the 
assembly does not need to be solved through early elections, but 
if no agreement is reached, the opposition is ready to accept 
even that challenge.

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro by </F>
Snjezana Mlinarevic; place and date not given: "We Began 
Allocating Shares"] 
  [Text]A vacuum in the Assembly; the government being 
incapable of regulating important regulations, like special 
taxes for instance, and, in the worst case, resorting to 
unpopular decrees; the resignation of Health Minister Andrija 
Hebrang in connection with a decision made by the Constitutional 
Court -- all this is making the government's life miserable as 
it has enough problems trying to administer the country with the 
unstable parliamentary processes. Deputy Prime Minister 
Borislav Skegro, in his department of economy, has to deal with 
most of those problems at present. Furthermore, his portfolio 
covers the constantly red- hot field of the transformation and 
privatization of social enterprises. 
  [Mlinarevic] Mr. Skegro, would you comment on the 
Constitutional Court's decision that present salaries in the 
field of medical services are unconstitutional? Did that create 
a precedent or could similar decisions meet the same fate? 
  [Skegro] I would not comment on the decision passed by the 
Constitutional Court. The court is an independent institution. 
I can, therefore, not predict the outcome of other cases either. 
  [Mlinarevic] The health minister's warning that overruling 
the decision would undermine the basis of the stabilization 
program is an important phenomenon. 
  [Skegro] Minister Hebrang has warned of resistance regarding 
the program, which we emphasize on a daily basis. His 
resignation shows his moral attitude. The resignation he 
submitted to Prime Minister Valentic does not necessarily have 
to be accepted. 
  [Mlinarevic] While the government is waiting for deputies to 
take their seats, many say it has got unnecessarily involved in 
the Split case of "Banovina." Why has the government become so 
involved over the purpose of one building? 
  [Skegro] I do not think it got involved at all, and that 
this is an insignificant problem, especially for Dalmatia. The 
Banovina building is the property of the state and the 
government must intervene in this and all similar cases. 
  [Mlinarevic] You have successfully completed the last round 
of negotiations with trade unions about the pay deal. The 
latest rift in the biggest trade union head office may bring new 
negotiators. Could you comment on that? 
  [Skegro] I would not comment on the events on the 
trade-union scene. Do you want me to come into conflict with 
trade unions, now that we managed to get used to being partners? 
But, seriously, the trade union turmoil is their internal 
problem. Government negotiators do not care who is the 
authorized negotiator of the other side. 
  [Mlinarevic] Some say Mr. Lesar is a weaker negotiator than 
say Boris Kunst, who announced a new and stronger trade union 
gathering. 
  [Skegro] I do not want to characterize negotiators, but in 
the present circumstances and considering our obligations toward 
international financial institutions, the government cannot, 
even if it wanted, be generous regarding trade union demands, 
which are often justified. 
  [Mlinarevic] Trade union members say that, in the latest 
talks, they managed to "draw in" a large number of firms from 
the circle of those that do not submit to pay limitations. Have 
you really plant bait for the trade-unions of "51 percent of 
registered shares" in the agreement? 
  [Skegro] Can you imagine that something like that is 
possible? Everybody has their own tactics in negotiations. 
Anyway, we do not fear salaries will explode in firms with more 
than 51 percent of registered shares. New privatization bills 
-- and we have been discussing them for a while -- propose that 
the dividend be paid on the entire package of shares, meaning 
also on the registered, partly-paid shares. Small shareholders 
will then have to consider which pays best. Before they give 
themselves a raise, they will calculate which pays better. If 
they opt for better salaries, they will reduce the dividend, 
although they should wait. And it does not take much 
calculation to figure out that income tax is much higher than 
profit tax. I do not think we will have to persuade 
shareholders that those figures are correct. 
  [Mlinarevic] The arrival of "fresh" money in Croatia is 
imminent. Moreover, the minister of finances has set a definite 
date for the first round of the foreign loan to come to Croatia 
very soon. How will the money be "spent"? 
  [Skegro] It was announced that the first loan from the World 
Bank of $128 million should be given the green light on 23 June, 
in addition to other loans that make up the sum of about $500 
million, and this will not be "consumed," even if we wanted 
that. Those are strictly special-purpose funds that will be 
used for rebuilding and building places that were destroyed in 
the war, as well as for the construction of the infrastructure; 
roads, the electric-power industry, water management, and 
agriculture. There can be no improvisation regarding that, for 
the world institution will have full control at all times, from 
insight into the dynamics of work to payments for every rebuilt 
house, for example. 
  [Mlinarevic] As deputy prime minister, you also function as 
the president of the Board of Management of the Croatian 
Privatization Fund. How do you account for contradictory views 
on the efficiency of the transformation process in Croatia, 
ranging from very positive to statements that the privatization 
model is a failure? 
  [Skegro] Easily. As the deputy prime minister who is also 
directly in charge of that area, I am expected to give a 
favorable judgment. I would, therefore, not like to pass 
judgment on the past privatization period or measures we 
introduced from that position. I think that the judgment of an 
independent institution is most objective and it was presented 
to our public. There are weaknesses during the aftermath of the 
transition process in all countries -- and Croatia is no 
exception -- but IMF and World Bank experts say this process in 
Croatia is very good. Anyhow, all further relations with 
Croatia are tied to the results of privatization. They see 
great progress and their objections refer to public state 
enterprises that have not been privatized yet. I am personally 
very pleased with the pace of introducing new ownership 
relations in firms, and the job of privatization and 
restructuring the economy is a painstaking and long process, 
even without war. 
  [Mlinarevic] So, you say that to say that there is social 
injustice in the transformation, which has also been compared 
with the South-American syndrome -- the rapid impoverishment of 
the masses and the rapid acquisition of wealth by a few -- is 
unfounded 
  [Skegro] I do not want to list the arguments that prove that 
those statements are false. Let me refer once again to the 
evaluation by the international institutions, and they probably 
know the circumstances in South America much better than some of 
our economists. 
  [Mlinarevic] Recently, several foreign companies have 
purchased shares in Croatian firms. Are foreign investors now 
more interested in Croatian firms? 
  [Skegro] Of course. The climate for investment has improved 
significantly, now we have several prominent international 
companies in Croatia; "Ericsson" will soon sign a contract to 
purchase the shares of "Nikola Tesla," Belgian "Interbrew" is 
here, German "Messer" and some others. Furthermore, the success 
with swap arrangements, selling shares for "old foreign-currency 
savings" [that were lost as a result of the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia] on the Zagreb Stock Exchange, is evidence enough of 
the progress of privatization. 
  [Mlinarevic] Still, the state is reluctant to relinquish its 
property. 
  [Skegro] I would not say it is reluctant or that it does not 
want to do that. However, we cannot rush into selling off firms 
just to get privatization off our backs. For example, can we do 
that with hotels for which there is a lot of interest in a 
situation like this? Are we to sell hotels cheaply just because 
the roads leading to them are destroyed at present? 
Furthermore, I do not think it is wise to sell firms that are 
making a profit in these circumstances as well. The state needs 
some of them. However, private property must prevail. 
  [Mlinarevic] Sessions of the Managing Board of the 
Privatization Fund have recently been opened for the press to 
see how decisions on selling firms are passed. On several 
occasions, you emphasized that this makes your work much easier. 
  [Skegro] Decisions about purchases and sales, and which also 
concern the destiny of firms and people employed there, are 
neither simple nor easy to reach. We must often consider 
elements that require sane judgment from different angles. It 
would be easier if money was the only element to be considered. 
Discussions, people advocating different things, the way of 
voting, that is all available to the press, it is all 
transparent, and that makes it easier for us to work, knowing 
that there can be no additional interpretations, which is a 
frequent phenomenon in everything that happens in the process of 
transformation. 
  [Mlinarevic] Journalist had the opportunity to notice that 
all members the Managing Board of the Privatization Fund meet 
very rarely, and their meetings most often barely have a quorum 
or are inquorate, as the last one was. How will you tackle this 
extensive agenda? 
  [Skegro] It will be difficult. It is obvious that the 
Managing Board is turning into a bottleneck of a kind. Composed 
of deputies, ministers of some key departments, and trade-union 
representatives who are burdened by other obligations, often 
away on business, the board is essentially a hindrance. Firms 
are waiting for decisions and this delay is impossible and 
costly for several reasons. 
  [Mlinarevic] Meetings of the Board, which are few and far 
between, have prompted you to consider professionalizing that 
body. 
  [Skegro] That should also be considered. Whether to have a 
fully professional, competent team that will be directly 
responsible to the government and parliament for each decision 
it makes or something similar to that effect. I think new 
privatization laws will introduce some new details into the work 
of the Managing Board. 
  [Mlinarevic] Will that also refer to the lower level, to 
managing boards in firms? 
  [Skegro] Managing boards in firms are not that much of a 
problem, although they will also be "checked." The more 
efficient the managing boards and the privatization, the fewer 
firms will have to be run by the state. 
  [Mlinarevic] New privatization laws were announced some time 
ago. From what was available to the public, we can deduce that 
the emphasis is on small shareholders. 
  [Skegro] That is correct. Very soon, the government will 
put together a new bill to be put before parliament. We are 
aware that the present pace of payment of share installments is 
very difficult for small shareholders without great sacrifice, 
although we did make some concessions at the beginning of the 
second year of payment. We will, therefore, considerably 
prolong the period of payment by installments and it will be 
longer than the present period of five years. Furthermore, we 
will also give a considerable discount for payment in full. 
After disabled veterans and the families of dead soldiers, the 
second category of citizens will follow -- refugees who will be 
given shares. 
  [Mlinarevic] Will this enable the reaching of a social 
consensus of all classes, because some say the state cares only 
about the chosen "critical mass" of shareholders? 
  [Skegro] I think the state should care about the small 
shareholders who trusted their firms, who, after all, accepted 
the risk of shareholding. However, all other categories will 
sooner or later be taken care of. But, everybody cannot be 
given an equal number of shares, nor do they deserve that. 
  [Mlinarevic] According to the first version, it is planned 
that the refugees are to get about 20,000 Croatian kuna worth of 
shares. Is that a modest amount? 
  [Skegro] Even children, minors, will have the right to get 
shares, so it will not be that insignificant in one family. 
However, it is more important which shares to distribute, and 
how to secure high-quality, profit-yielding shares that can be 
sold at a price not lower than nominal, instead of just "paper." 
  [Mlinarevic] You attempted to solve the problem -- with 
regard to disabled veterans -- by founding the HDF [Croatian 
Patriotic Fund]. You got involved personally, but as we see, 
the HDF is not functioning as it should. 
  [Skegro] Yes, I personally supported the HDF project as the 
first investment fund, the forerunner of others to come, 
however, we encountered problems on two levels. Firstly, the 
lack of experts who would lead such a fund. We simply do not 
have people educated for that and this will continue to be a 
problem. On the other hand, disabled veterans demanded -- and 
no one can or wants to deny them that right -- that they chose 
the shares themselves and manage them independently, keeping 
them or selling them on the market, instead of keeping them at 
the HDF with a guaranteed dividend. Therefore, the Managing 
Board of the Fund has recently decided to share out, from its 
own portfolio, all shares of the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, which 
are in great demand among disabled veterans. 
  [Mlinarevic] Investment funds, as a part of the further 
privatization strategy, have been announced, but also forgotten, 
it seems. Is the HDF one of the reasons? 
  [Skegro] They were not forgotten. We have been encountering 
the same problems: Who will lead those funds? We are preparing 
the establishment of the largest investment fund, the Fund for 
Rebuilding, whose beneficiaries will be those who suffered most 
in the war. This could be a possibility for the refugees, but, 
having learnt from the experience with disabled veterans, we do 
not know how the refugees will want to realize their right to 
shares. Furthermore, there is the Pension Fund and a couple of 
other funds. 
  [Mlinarevic] On the other hand, the distribution of shares 
-- and the Zagreb Tobacco Factory is a case in point -- could 
quietly lead to a take-over of factory by foreign companies, and 
the state is protecting the tobacco shares precisely from that. 
  [Skegro] In the ownership structure that will, in time, 
develop in the Zagreb Tobacco Factory, once the shares are 
distributed -- and there will be a large number of small 
shareholders -- take-overs will not occur unforeseen. But you 
can rest assured that we created protection mechanisms in the 
firm itself, and the state has its own way of influencing the 
course of privatization of the firm. There will be no major 
take-overs, especially after the experience of some eastern 
countries, where tobacco factories were bought just because of 
the market and then closed. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  The Right Time Is Yet to Come </H5>
  [Mlinarevic] You also advocate the distribution of shares. 
If they are being shared out as late as now, was the pace and 
the time for the distribution not more important than the 
principle of distribution itself? 
  [Skegro] That is correct. I think that the time for mass 
privatization was determined well in Croatia. What would happen 
if we had such a strategy at the beginning of transformation? 
An abundance of vouchers in a country at war! I claim that 
would be lethal; who, today, could know who owes shares? A 
"hostile take- over" of our firms, as an economic term, would 
probably also happen literally. Naturally, we are counting on 
the distribution of shares in transition. Disabled veterans 
were first in line, and we will also cover other categories of 
the population. 
<H5>  [Box, p 9] </H5>
<H5>  Bankruptcy </H5>
  [Mlinarevic] In spite of the good results of the 
stabilization program, the latest data show many insolvencies 
among firms. How do you explain that? 
  [Skegro] It is very simple. Insolvency, just that part 
concentrated in two or three branches of economy, is the result 
of the chronic nonsettlement of debts between firms that surface 
powerfully at a time of zero-inflation. 
  [Mlinarevic] Still, regarding that, the question of 
bankruptcy has again become topical. One gets the impression 
that there are no bankruptcies, for they are a matter of 
political decision. 
  [Skegro] There are no bankruptcies of large firms like there 
were three years ago. Not that many and with such consequences. 
However, it is not true that bankruptcy is a matter of political 
decision, nor that politics controls it and artificially 
inhibits it. Anyhow, bankruptcy is an everyday occurrence, our 
data show that. Indeed, they are not very stormy, which is 
good, they do not include a large number of employees at one 
place. There are no big changes, but that does not mean there 
are no bankruptcies as a normal phenomenon in the market 
economy. However, there will be large-scale bankruptcies, but 
we must take them as a process of healing the economy that will 
be accompanied by a strengthened social program.

<F P=106> [Article by Branko Vojicic: "Montenegro and `War Booty': </F>
Plunder of Looted Croatian Riches"] 
  [Text] Podgorica--The Montenegrin public has still not been 
told that Montenegro has returned part of its plundered "war 
booty"--paintings and drawings that the former JNA [Yugoslav 
People's Army], in its famous "liberation" raid on Dubrovnik, 
"captured" at the summer house of renowned painter Milovan 
Stanic in Mali Zaton. Specifically, since there was not a single 
representative of the Montenegrin "fourth estate" present at the 
transfer of the paintings and drawings, the local media have 
remained mute and the public has been short-changed for the 
umpteenth time concerning the details of this significant step 
in normalizing relations between the Republic of Croatia and 
Montenegro. 
<H5>  What MONITOR Reveals </H5>
  In light of this fact, the article "Paths of War Booty" 
published by the independent Podgorica weekly MONITOR is of 
interest. The article talks about how students from Niksic--in 
military uniform and with passes--were transported to the 
Dubrovnik front in organized fashion to "gather war booty." 
Specifically, the weekly reveals that in early March 1992, while 
the war was raging around Dubrovnik, 15 students, residents of 
the "Vucinic Brothers" dormitory in Niksic, led by Radoman 
Kovacevic, director of that institution, loaded six truck 
tractors and two trailer trucks with goods from the "Mlini" and 
"Kupari" hotel complexes and transported them to Niksic amid air 
support and the protection of the military police. The operation 
was organized by the successor to the army that shot its own 
soldiers for stealing apples--the former JNA and current Armed 
Forces of Yugoslavia [VJ]. MONITOR published a photocopy of 
Radoman Kovacevic's permit "to take from the Mlini (hotel) 
furniture, radiators, dishes, and kitchen supplies for the needs 
of the Niksic dormitory," as well as a pass "authorizing 
movement to and from Sutorina and Trebinje." This permit was 
signed, "under the authority of the commander," by head of the 
civilian administration agency, Colonel Drago Pipovic. The 
stolen goods were transported by "Autoprevozno" of Niksic, which 
properly billed the dormitory for its services in transporting 
160 metric tons of "equipment, furniture, and miscellany" along 
the Niksic-Kupari-Niksic route. 
  Scarcely four months had passed since the successful looting 
expedition when a dispute broke out among employees of the 
Niksic dormitory. The director was accused of having seized 
everything, and it was alleged that the "war booty" was 
extensive: expensive paintings (for some time they adorned 
Kovacevic's office, but then they disappeared), large safes of 
gold and foreign exchange, plus television sets, expensive 
furniture, telephone exchanges worth hundreds of thousands of 
German marks.... 
<H5>  Mercedes for a Fistful of Marks </H5>
  "We do not know where such things are," it was said at a 
special session (closed to the public) of that institution's 
board, when several dormitory employees suggested that 
"officially not a single specification arrived" and that the 
dormitory has not benefited from it in the least. 
  On the contrary, the director rewarded the students who went 
with him on the adventure--with free dormitory services until 
the end of the school year. However, the director refuted the 
charges by saying, "Although I have a moral right to enter 
ustasha houses, there are no items in my possession!" 
  "The legal person did not provide evidence of the property 
at 
his disposal," because of which it was not possible "to exercise 
control over the financial-material business dealing," concluded 
the financial police, which has been involved in the entire case 
ever since charges were brought by the minister of education 
against Director Kovacevic, but not because of the plunder, but 
rather because of the illegal rehiring of a former dormitory 
secretary. Kovacevic was called before the examining magistrate 
only six months later, but after that the whole matter sank into 
oblivion. 
  It appears that the further investigation into Kovacevic was 
halted by the former chief of the VJ General Staff, Zivota 
Panic, with the cooperation of General Pavle Strugar and General 
Radomir Damljanovic, insiders allege. Apparently they did not 
want to raise questions concerning the thefts because all 
indications are that they too had "lined their pockets." For 
example, Strugar "bought" a Mercedes 190 brought in from the 
Dubrovnik front for several hundred German marks, while 
Damljanovic got a luxury Peugeot for a few marks more. 
  Recently, however, the "Kovacevic case" has been 
"activated." 
The court has authorized experts to gather evidence of the 
director's "abuses in connection with procuring food for the 
dormitory, trading a freezer for one automobile tire, giving 
free housing to some students," and several other minor 
irregularities. No one mentions the theft of "war booty."

<F P=106> [Article by Davor Drezga: "Croatian-Macedonian Economic </F>
Cooperation: Free Trade Zone for Greater Exchange"] 
  [Text] Zagreb--In order to promote mutual cooperation as 
well as overall economic and trade relations between Croatia and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
a cooperative agreement between the economic chambers of the two 
states was signed Thursday at the Croatian Economic Chamber 
[HGK]. This document, through which active measures are 
undertaken on a reciprocal basis to promote the economy, to 
stimulate the development of trade, and to support economic and 
technological cooperation between Croatia and Macedonia, was 
signed by the HGK chairman Mladen Vedris and GKM [Economic 
Chamber of Macedonia] chairman Dusan Petreski. 
  The agreement stipulates that the chambers will assist one 
another, within the bounds of what is possible, in appearances 
at international exhibitions and other events in Croatia and 
Macedonia. In addition, there will be support in organizing 
seminars, business meetings, and reciprocal visits by trade 
delegations. The chambers will also cooperate in the area of 
international arbitration, patent law, and trademark protection. 
  Referring to the difficult recent period during which 
economic cooperation between Croatia and Macedonia has fallen 
off, Mladen Vedris emphasized that now we must focus on the time 
to come. He added that businessmen feel a need for business ties 
in various activities and sectors. A philosophy of economic 
cooperation could be created on the basis of a free trade zone, 
which presupposes liberalization in economic relations. This 
would promote the establishment of a higher level of trade, 
Vedris said. Vedris invited Macedonian businessmen to come 
exhibit their products at the Zagreb Trade Fair. 
  Noting that economic structures in Macedonia have been in 
crisis for three years now, Dusan Petreski said that despite the 
crisis, an economic reform program is being carried out, but 
slowly. Privatization is also proceeding gradually. 
  Petreski emphasized that the Macedonian economy is 
interested 
in expanding trade with Croatia, which last year amounted to (a 
total of) $84 million. Macedonia had a small deficit, which it 
would like to even out. Petreski stressed that the vast majority 
of the trade is based on compensation and barter, while 
cooperative arrangements between enterprises have ended 
entirely. The Macedonian business sector would like to 
liberalize trade relations with Croatia. 
  Petreski then spoke of the need to adopt, as soon as 
possible, numerous documents that are important to economic ties 
between Croatia and Macedonia: agreements on commercial and 
economic cooperation and on eliminating double taxation; accords 
on investment, employment, and social security; and an agreement 
on trade payments, which he considers very important. Petreski 
invited representatives of the HGK to visit Macedonia, and his 
invitation was accepted.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "J. Hruby: The Purification of the Social </F>
Democratic Party of Slovakia Is No Longer Possible"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Social Democratic Party of Slovakia 
(SDSS) is at the bottom. The coalition agreement with the Party 
of the Democratic Left on the joint course of action in the 
early parliamentary elections is too binding for them and 
deprives them of their identity. This is what SDSS Deputy 
Chairman Jozef Hruby says in the declaration he provided to TA 
SR yesterday, through the Press and Information Department of 
the Movement For a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  The enormous debt, amounting to tens of millions, and the 
permanently reappearing attempts by principal functionaries at 
violating their own statuses have disturbed the peaceful ranks 
of the SDSS so much, J. Hruby continues, that the need to 
establish an authentic social democratic party is being 
discussed more and more openly. In his opinion, it is difficult 
to expect a reversal at the meeting of the SDSS Central Council, 
which is to take place on 25 June. Those who are against the 
planned merger with the Party of the Democratic Left are most 
likely to ignore it and will not come. Those who are hesitating 
or have fear will be silent, and, as soon as the Central Council 
has a quorum, the supporters of the merger will push through 
their cause. 
  Jaroslav Volf is likely to enter SDSS history as the SDSS's 
most successful liquidator. It is a sad thing that he often 
uses the name of Alexander Dubcek as a shield. In view of his 
attitudes, it is immoral, Hruby said at the conclusion of the 
declaration. 
  The SDSS Central Council Presidium rejected Hruby's 
declaration as fictitious, unfounded, and subjective. It is 
allegedly motivated by his personal failure to get his name on 
the preliminary list of candidates for parliamentary elections 
in 1994 in the order he would like to have seen.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Party of the Democratic Left Does Not </F>
Interfere in Disputes Within the Social Democratic Party in 
Slovakia; There Has Never Been Talk of Merger"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] 
approaches the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS] with 
respect, treating it as a partner party. It has never had the 
ambition to interfere in its internal affairs. This was stated 
by SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik in response to the 
statement issued by SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby. Ftacnik 
said that there did not exist a single SDL document or working 
paper that would talk about a merger with the SDSS. 
  On the other hand, in the document entitled "Draft Concept 
of 
the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Course of Action 
in the Preelection Period in the Foreign Policy Sphere," it is 
stated on page 7, under item 6.5: "Can a merger of the HZDS with 
the Social Democratic Party be considered in the future?" SDSS 
Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby should therefore turn his attention 
in another direction, Milan Ftacnik noted. 
  The SDL statement goes on to say: "We know that the 
left-wing 
coalition of the SDL, the SDSS, the Farmers Movement, and the 
Green Party in Slovakia [SZS] is a thorn in the flesh of certain 
circles in the HZDS, which has found itself in international 
political isolation and remains without a clear-cut profile. 
The question arises whether this voice from within the SDSS is 
not all too reminiscent of the departure of a small group from 
the SZS, which had also rejected a democratically drafted and 
approved coalition agreement in the name of the preservation of 
the party's authenticity and objections to the SDL and started 
to establish a new party and simultaneously send out signals to 
the HZDS. 
  The game of breaking up the [HZDS's] most serious political 
and electoral competitor, the Left Choice coalition, apparently 
continues. It bears testimony to the nervousness and lack of 
self-confidence of those who organize it from behind the scenes.

<F P=106> [Article by "TA SR, ao": "Lone Soldier in the Field; </F>
Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Social Democratic Party in 
Slovakia on Disagreements Within the Party"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--"Chairman Jaroslav Volf knows very well 
that the situation in the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia 
[SDSS] is very tense," SDSS Deputy Chairman Jozef Hruby stated 
in an interview for the TA SR, adding that he cannot be bought, 
which the SDSS chairman knows very well. 
  Speaking about his attitude toward the SDSS's close 
cooperation with the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], Hruby 
said that it was exactly the same as that of [late SDSS 
Chairman] Alexander Dubcek. Hruby noted that, during elections 
to the SDSS Central Council at the last party congress, he had 
received the largest number of votes of all candidates. In 
spite of that and in spite of his being SDSS deputy chairman, he 
had been offered the 46th place on the joint slate of candidates 
[of the Left Choice coalition of four left-wing, agrarian, and 
green parties]. He added that not every SDSS member was buying 
the honey-sweet rhetoric [not further specified), which is why 
it is quite possible that the party will split into two 
entities. He said that it was questionable whether Jaroslav 
Volf's friends from the SDL would still be interested in the 
Social Democratic appendage that will stay with Volf. 
  Yesterday, we asked SDSS Chairman Jaroslav Volf: "Your party 
is supposedly falling apart. Is that true?" 
  He replied: "It is possible that some people harbor this 
wish. Farmers and Greens had already been targeted, and I 
suppose it is now the Social Democrats' turn.... I believe, 
however, that this is just the effort of certain people from the 
outside to exploit the personal disappointment of individuals 
who have not been successful on the slate of candidates or, 
possibly, a case of failure to comprehend that the preservation 
of the party's identity is not incompatible with a coalition, 
which can, moreover, spread Social Democratic ideas and give 
them much greater publicity and a chance also in parliament and 
the government. I cannot but assess these efforts by 
individuals as an attempt that will most likely not meet with a 
favorable response in our party. Quite the contrary. These 
people are actually sealing their own fate."

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by Maria </F>
Hluchanova and Jan Pankovcikova; place and date not given: "We 
Have Revived the Idea of Merging the Liberal Parties of the 
Center"] 
  [Text] [SME] The Democratic Union [DU] has offered the 
National Democratic Party (NDS) the opportunity to run on its 
list of candidates in the elections. What made you take this 
step? 
  [Moravcik] This is nothing new. We spoke with Mr. Cernak 
and his colleagues a long time ago. We may not have reached an 
agreement at that time, but it is a different situation now, and 
we thought it was necessary to discuss once again the original 
project, which is still attractive. The parties of the center 
that are oriented more or less liberally should unite, and this 
is why we have revived this idea. 
  [SME] Could you specify in what respect the situation is 
new? Several weeks ago, the DU Republican Council presented a 
final resolution of your party to run independently in the 
elections, and Mr. Cernak discussed preelection cooperation with 
the Christian Democratic Movement.... 
  [Moravcik] We spoke about establishing a confederation of 
parties of the center before the elections. There is not enough 
time for this, however. Now, the opportunity has arisen to 
reach agreement with the NDS on a joint list of candidates. 
  [SME] So, we were mistaken when we thought that the DU's 
lists of candidates had been closed? 
  [Moravcik] They are not. Within our party, we agreed on the 
leaders in the individual electoral regions. 
  [SME] The Democratic Union announced that it was open to 
negotiations with the Democratic Party (DS).... 
  [Moravcik] Yes, we are fulfilling the project about which we 
spoke--a gradual merger of the parties of the center. This is 
important for Slovakia mainly from the viewpoint of the 
crystallization of the political scene. We are trying, and will 
try, to fill the center and the gap right of the center. 
However, this will require more time than the time we have left 
before the elections in the fall. 
  [SME] What places are you offering to the NDS and the DS on 
your lists of candidates? 
  [Moravcik] The talks will continue. It is premature to 
speak about it for the time being.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Julius Gembicky; place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] is the 
backbone and the core of the Left Choice [electoral alliance 
formed by the SDL, the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia, the 
Green Party in Slovakia, and the Farmers Movement]. Because of 
its stable preferences in preelection polls, it has good 
prospects for the fall elections. In spite of this, it is being 
alleged that there are disagreements among its leaders, a rift 
within the party, and even a secret plan on a postelection 
coalition with the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]. 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Weiss, under what circumstances would the SDL 
be ready to form a coalition with the Meciarites after the 
elections? 
  [Weiss] If we had the certainty that no HZDS deputy would 
give the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to a recent 
incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak 
greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament, who has 
black hair and wears a moustache, with a "Heil Hitler"] and that 
the policy of this movement, which incites the people and sets 
Slovaks against one another and Slovaks against Hungarians, will 
change; if they stopped fabricating theories about a conspiracy 
against the Slovak Republic and if we had the certainty that 
their policy will be based on expertise and that HZDS 
representatives will be able to abide by agreements and will 
give up the idea of steamrolling and breaking up other parties 
by rectifying or dismissing their leaderships. It would be 
possible if we were linked, moreover, by a relative proximity of 
our programs. In that case, we would be ready to consider even 
a coalition with the HZDS. 
  [Gembicky] Does all of this apply to a coalition with the 
HZDS even if it is headed by Mr. Meciar? 
  [Weiss] I do not think the problems of HZDS policy are 
caused only by the personality of Vladimir Meciar, even though 
he did everything within human power to damage relations with 
all of the other parties. The extempore performance staged in 
parliament by Ivan Luptak demonstrated what kind of 
undercurrents there are in this movement and in which direction 
it could evolve. The decision about what will happen after the 
elections will be made by the voters, but the further direction 
of the evolution of the HZDS must be determined by this movement 
itself. The HZDS is in evident foreign political isolation, 
and, despite its considerable influence in our society, it has 
also drifted into domestic political isolation. Its inability 
to prepare any coalition is proof of this. 
  [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the formation 
of a coalition with the HZDS, including Vladimir Meciar, after 
the elections, in case it shows interest in it? 
  [Weiss] If the HZDS keeps reverting to the political tone it 
uses vis-a-vis the SDL, I must raise the question of whether he 
who spends his entire energy on breaking up his future partner 
can be trusted as a partner for cooperation. 
  [Gembicky] Would the SDL reject postelection cooperation if 
the demand of the HZDS or its chairman was: Yes to the SDL but 
without Weiss and [SDL Deputy Chairman] Ftacnik? 
  [Weiss] I do not think the HZDS will be in a situation, 
after the elections, in which it will be able to set conditions. 
Such an ultimatum is unacceptable to us. The decision on with 
whom we will enter into a coalition will be made by the Republic 
Council or an SDL congress. 
  [Gembicky] The SDL's preferences are relatively high, and 
the Left Choice could have the decisive influence on the 
formation of the government coalition after the elections. What 
is the ranking of the SDL's potential partners? 
  [Weiss] In view of the proximity of programs and acceptance 
abroad, the Democratic Union of Slovakia [DU] is the most 
natural ally. After all, a leftist-liberal coalition is nothing 
exceptional in the world. We would again offer cooperation to 
the Association of Workers of Slovakia (ZRS) and, depending on 
the correlation of forces, we would consider other potential 
partners. We continue to proceed from the idea that the depth 
of the crisis in Slovakia and the complexity of the tasks that 
will have to be tackled by any government are so huge that 
broader cooperation will have to be sought. And such 
cooperation rules out diktat by any of the partners. 
  [Gembicky] Did you come across any negative reactions to the 
rejection of cooperation with the HZDS during your recent 
meetings with the [SDL] mayors of towns and villages in central 
and eastern Slovakia? 
  [Weiss] Both citizens and mayors understand why it was 
necessary to support the vote of no-confidence in Vladimir 
Meciar. This is not the SDL's main problem. The SDL's problem 
is, rather, that some of our members and supporters cannot 
comprehend why we entered into a coalition with the right-wing 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. The emotional reactions to 
some statements by KDH representatives about the SDL before the 
1992 elections are still vivid in memory. Because we had to say 
a resolute no to the confrontational style of politics, the 
systematic search for an enemy, and the neoparty [neostranicka] 
terminology of labeling anyone a traitor, a janissary, and a 
saboteur, it was necessary to look for allies. 
  It was necessary to put an end to the political crisis 
generated by the HZDS and the Slovak National Party [SNS], two 
political entities without a clear-cut profile, by their falling 
apart. A minority government would be unable to accomplish 
this. That is why a new majority was found that was able to 
stabilize the situation and agree on calling early parliamentary 
elections. 
  The historical dimension must be taken into account as 
well. Slovakia has experienced several political coups since 
1938. Each of them produced many losers, who can become 
exponents of longing for revenge and the settling of accounts. 
It is very important for Slovakia not to exhaust its energy on 
hatred but on cooperation. A coalition of the left, the center, 
and the right is a certain experiment in Slovak political life. 
However, it forces all political parties to cooperate, in 
defiance of differences in their programs. Slovenia has had 
good experience with such a coalition, and a red-black coalition 
[of Socialists and the conservative People's Party] is working 
well also in Austria. 
  The KDH, too, is having problems accepting the SDL as a 
coalition partner. However, if we were to build only on 
negative experience, it could easily happen that we would stop 
talking to one another and be unable to shake hands. My idea of 
politics is such, however, that, regardless of different 
programs and divergent political values and irrespective of a 
tough electoral contest, we must not hate one another. 
  [Gembicky] Do you concede the possibility of the coalition 
with the KDH continuing after the elections, should this become 
necessary? 
  [Weiss] This possibility is open but so are other options. 
The HZDS's speculations and calculations with the SDL's breakup 
are self-serving. The dictum I am the strongest current 
[allusion to a statement by Vladimir Meciar] does not apply to 
the SDL. The SDL is not founded on a single political star. It 
has a constellation of experienced politicians. Even though 
these personalities have different views on some tactical steps, 
we discuss these differences democratically in order to arrive 
at a common opinion.

<F P=106> [Interview with National Democratic Party Chairman Ludovit </F>
Cernak by Martin Krno on 15 June; place not given] 
  [Text] The lunchtime telephone conversation between Jozef 
Moravcik and Ludovit Cernak on 9 June shuffled the cards on the 
preelection political scene. That is to say, surprisingly, the 
National Democratic Party-New Alternative [NDS-NA] stopped 
flirting with the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and 
started to pat the shoulders of the Democratic Union [DU] in an 
amiable manner. Yesterday, we interviewed NDS Chairman Ludovit 
Cernak on the reasons for this change. 
  [Krno] It seemed just a week ago that your electoral 
alliance with Jan Carnogursky was already as good as secured. 
What contributed to the decision to abandon your preelection 
wooing of the KDH? 
  [Cernak] Politics is the art of compromise and the art of 
bargaining. Despite this, we have proceeded in a clear-cut and 
fair manner. We stated publicly again and again that we would 
be most happy if all five entities in the political center and 
right of center were to go into the elections together. Our 
next priority was for a centrist policy and, following up on 
this, we were willing to consider the KDH offer. The change in 
the DU's point of view was a decisive occurrence. We informed 
the Christian Democrats of this immediately. The point of view 
that strengthening the center will improve the prospects for the 
future broad ruling coalition's electoral success is indeed 
pragmatic and sensible. The DU is a priority for us; the 
political grouping that the Alternative for Political Realism, 
the Alliance of Democrats, and the NDS formed in expressing no 
confidence in the former government has, naturally, crystallized 
as a movement of the center. The public received it positively 
on the whole. Therefore, we are pleased that there has been a 
change in the DU's point of view. I have to say, however, that 
our approach toward the KDH in the talks was correct. 
  [Krno] You surely asked the DU's representatives what led 
them to change their decision because the Union's Republican 
Council adopted a resolution recently that it would enter into 
the elections independently... 
  [Cernak] I did not delve into the essentials of why they 
changed their mind. I assume that it was their realization of 
their responsibility for the policy of the center. After all, 
the existence of lots of tiny little parties is nonsense. The 
best thing for them would be to merge--and not only two of 
them--into a single entity after the elections and formulate a 
professional policy with strong support. 
  [Krno] Into a single entity? As into one party? 
  [Cernak] Yes. 
  [Krno] In what form should you enter into the parliamentary 
elections with the DU? 
  [Cernak] The DU has made us an offer that is in fact 
technically the same as the KDH offer--this means, opening its 
lists of candidates to members of other political entities. 
  [Krno] As far as the number of elective places are 
concerned, will you be in a better position than you were with 
the KDH, which offered you the chance of five seats in the 
National Council? 
  [Cernak] We will be in about the same position. 
  [Krno] On 13 June, when we asked at a Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] Deputies' Club briefing what kind of 
conclusions they intended to come to with regard to their 
colleague Ivan Luptak for his conduct [giving the Nazi salute to 
Cernak] in parliament, they said that this was in reaction to 
your improper handling of the National Council meeting. Why did 
you handle it undemocratically? 
  [Cernak] I disagree fundamentally with this claim. These 
are the twists and turns and excuses of a movement that is 
incapable of adopting a tough point of view on the statements 
and conduct of its own deputy. I am convinced that this was a 
short circuit on the part of Mr. Luptak. However, one has to 
pay for short circuits in life and especially in politics. The 
HZDS Deputies' Club should distance itself clearly from such 
statements made in parliament. I have read the stenographic 
record of the meeting carefully. I definitely proceeded in 
accordance with the rules of procedure.

<F P=106> [Article by "(zl)": "Miklos Duray Is the Most Unpopular"] </F>
  [Text] Representatives of the Center for Social and 
Marketing Analysis (FOCUS) yesterday made available data from a 
poll conducted to ascertain public opinion before the 
parliamentary elections in the fall. It is apparent from the 
poll that, in the wake of the volatility on the political scene 
in March, the situation has calmed down and that there has been 
a slight increase in support for the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] and a slight decline for the Party of the 
Democratic Left [SDL]. The Democratic Union [DU] has a real 
chance of getting into parliament. 
  The poll's results in response to the question "Why would 
you 
vote?" are interesting. In essence, the replies can be placed 
into four categories. Support for a party or movement was 
predominant in the first category; up to one-quarter of the 
respondents would vote in accordance with this support. The 
second category is made up of respondents who give priority to 
asserting group interests. The replies of workers, national 
economic minorities, believers, and those favoring the Slovak 
nation were predominant in this category. Those who give 
priority to the programs of the political parties were ranked in 
the third category. The last category was made up of 
respondents who would vote for a personality. They accounted 
for 12 percent of the respondents. A typical response to the 
question on why they would not vote was: "No party is worthy of 
my vote." 
  According to the FOCUS poll, the greatest trust is enjoyed 
by 
M. Kovac (22.8 percent), V. Meciar (22.2 percent), J. Moravcik 
(21.7 percent), and Peter Weiss (14.1 percent). L. Cernak 
received only 2-percent support. In reply to the question "Who 
do you consider to be very pleasant?," the respondents said the 
following: M. Kovac (29.9 percent), J. Moravcik (29.9 percent), 
I. Gasparovic (23.4 percent), V. Meciar (22.5 percent), and P. 
Weiss (22.2 percent). In reply to the question "Who do you 
consider to be unpleasant?," the rankings were as follows: 
Miklos Duray (64.2 percent), Jan Carnogursky (52.6 percent), 
and Vojtech Bugar (50 percent). V. Meciar is unpleasant for 
41.5 percent of respondents. According to FOCUS, J. Volf (with 
6.7 percent) came last in this category. 
  Some 7.1 percent of respondents acknowledged that they were 
unequivocally left wing, 6.7 percent that they were 
unequivocally right wing, and 44.1 percent that they were more 
toward the center. Almost half of the respondents would prefer a 
"market economy, if the state influences it to a considerable 
extent." 
  [The same newspaper on the same date on page 1, under the 
headline "Many Candidates--Few Chosen," carries the following 
table, based on FOCUS's analysis of replies to the question 
"Imagine that new parliamentary elections were to be held this 
weekend. Which party or movement would you vote for?"

<F P=106> ["Regular" interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F>
correspondent Martin Bartisek; place and date not 
given--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bartisek] A new entity has 
emerged on our political scene--the New Slovakia movement. 
Honorary Chairman Rudolf Mosny has proposed the abolition of 
the Ministry for Administration and Privatization of National 
Property. What do you think about his proposal? It is possible 
to assume, to a certain degree, that it was put forward by a man 
of some experience. Moreover, he says that, in our country, 
privatization has become a political instrument. I am, in fact, 
asking two questions. 
  [Moravcik] I agree with both of them. As far as turning 
privatization into a political issue is concerned, we spoke out 
about this already some time ago, and we are striving to 
depoliticize privatization. From this viewpoint, it is possible 
to agree with this idea. However, as far as the activities of 
our Cabinet are concerned, we strive to respect the above 
principle strictly--that is, we would not like privatization to 
be an arena of political influence by individual parties, to be 
carried out so that supporters of one or the other party gain 
some unfair advantages. This will have a very negative impact. 
If privatization is being linked to policy, it should be only 
economic policy. This is our aim. This means that privatization 
should support the Cabinet's economic policy. 
  The measure we adopted today is aimed at this--we proposed 
releasing 3.5 billion korunas of the money we gained or are 
going to gain through privatization of national property. We 
want to release this money to give an impetus to the development 
of our economy. 
  [Bartisek] However, your reaction to the call for the 
abolition of the Ministry for Privatization was positive. 
  [Moravcik] At present, there are still reasons for the 
existence of the ministry, given the current concept of 
privatization as outlined in the Privatization Act. If we 
change this concept, which is defined by the current norms, we 
might even imagine abolishing the Ministry for Privatization. 
It is, of course, possible to discuss this issue. However, the 
implementation of this idea before the elections can be 
excluded. [passage omitted]

  [Text] According to the initial and still incomplete 
results of the self-government elections held yesterday, the 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has won in Bedzin, Bydgoszcz, 
Czestochowa, Kielce, Konin, Koszalin, Legnica, Lodz, Olsztyn, 
Plock, Suwalki, Walbrzych, and Wloclawek. 
  In Lublin, almost the same number of votes was received by 
candidates of the SLD, the center-right, and the Freedom Union 
[UW]. 
  In Warsaw, victory went to a coalition of Freedom Union, the 
Conservative Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party; in Gdansk, 
Gdynia, Krakow, and Wroclaw to the Freedom Union. The 
center-right received the greatest number of votes in Bialystok, 
Chorzow, Lomza, Przemysl, Rzeszow, and Torun. 
  The turnout was low--between 25 and 40 percent. The official 
results of the self-government elections should be known on 
Friday, State Electoral Commission Secretary Kazimierz Czaplicki 
told this station today.

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Prime Minister Lech Walesa by an </F>
unidentified correspondent at the Gdansk polling station on 19 
June--recorded] 
  [Text] Polling stations opened at 0800 hours: 27.5 million 
Poles eligible to vote will elect 52,000 councillors for 2,500 
parish councils. President Lech Walesa and his family voted in 
Gdansk at 1215. 
  [Correspondent] President Walesa arrived at the polling 
station after attending Mass at the St. Stanislaw Kostka Church 
in Gdansk-Oliwa. His wife and daughter accompanied him to the 
district polling station. 
  President, how do you assess the work of local government in 
the previous term in office? 
  [Walesa] I think that in these conditions and after such a 
long time of being deprived of democratic liberties, local 
government has really achieved a lot. A lot, but the needs were 
even greater. 
  [Correspondent] What do you expect from councillors who will 
be elected for the coming term? 
  [Walesa] I hope they will learn from the experience of their 
predecessors and that they will concentrate even more on the 
most important issues to meet the demands of small communities, 
that they will resolve problems important to specific regions. 
  [Correspondent] President, do you not think that a possible 
victory of the Polish Peasant Party may halt the political 
reform and decentralization of the state? 
  [Walesa] This is unlikely and is not possible because the 
circumstances are different. That is the first reason. The 
second reason is that the system operates itself now. 
Politicians are not in the position to do much harm. They can 
make it difficult but not sufficiently difficult to destroy what 
has already been started. 
  [Announcer] Correspondents from all over the country report 
that the elections are taking place peacefully. Interest has 
not been great so far. On average, there are eight candidates 
for one seat in multiseat constituencies, and three candidates 
in single-seat constituencies. In Chelm and Elblag Provinces, 
Senate by-elections are also being held.

<F P=106> [Article by R.W.] </F>
  [Text] A week before the self-governmental elections, 60 
percent of adult Poles intended to take part in the voting (35 
percent of them knew this for certain). Over 40 percent still 
had no idea who they would support. The most numerous group of 
respondents intended to support nonpartisan candidates; as for 
political parties, the most popular was the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD], followed by the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and 
the Union of Freedom [UW]. Almost every sixth respondent did 
not know the party to which "his" candidate belongs. The poll 
was carried out by the Sopot Public Opinion Research Institute 
[PBS] at the request of RZECZPOSPOLITA. 
  Even though 60 percent of respondents declared that they are 
willing to go to the polls, the final voter turnout should be 
estimated at a considerably lower level. Opinion researchers 
have already often noticed that actual voter turnout is indeed 
closer to the number of people whose answer to the question 
concerning their intention of voting was "definitely yes." 
There are 35 percent of them, so we can expect a turnout of 
approximately 40 percent. These calculations are also confirmed 
by specialists from the Center for Research on Public Opinion 
[OBOP]; this center has obtained almost identical results as the 
Sopot institute. 
  Among those who will go to the polls in the greatest numbers 
are people with higher educations (nearly 60 percent of them are 
absolutely sure they will vote), the richest people, people 
employed in the budget sector, white-collar workers of higher 
and medium levels, and parliamentary voters of most of the 
well-known parties. This particularly concerns the former 
"Fatherland" coalition, of which the Christian-National Union is 
the main component, as well as the Union for Real Politics, the 
former Democratic Union, and the Polish Peasant Party-Peasant 
Accord. More than 50 percent of representatives from these 
groups say that they will certainly go to the polls. 
  The greatest reservations can be observed among poorly 
educated respondents, rather poor people, manual workers, 
especially unskilled workers, and housewives. 
  People who declare the desire to vote very frequently do not 
yet know which name they will choose on 19 June. Total lack of 
knowledge is declared by 44 percent of respondents in this 
group; 22 percent have their favorites but are still hesitant. 
Only every third respondent knows for certain who he will 
support. 
  Most disorientated are young people, with vocational 
education, with low incomes, the unemployed, school and 
university students, and those who supported the former 
Liberal-Democratic Congress and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of 
Reforms [BBWR] in the parliamentary elections. The least doubts 
are expressed by respondents between the ages of 40 and 59, with 
higher education, well-off individuals, and peasants and 
representatives of the managerial cadre. 
  Every fifth respondent (20 percent) says that the candidate 
he is going to support does not belong to any party; every sixth 
(17 percent) person is not able to identify himself with any 
particular grouping. The rest are going to support a candidate 
fielded by one of the political organizations. Most frequently 
mentioned are the SLD, the PSL, and the UW (which received much 
lower preference ratings than during the parliamentary 
elections). Between 1 and 2 percent of respondents are going to 
vote for each center-right party.

  A PBS poll for RZECZPOSPOLITA, conducted on 11 and 12 June; 
a 
1,043-person representative sample of adult inhabitants of 
Poland. The OBOP poll, conducted between 20 and 25 May, 
consisted of 1,079 interviews conducted with a random sample of 
adult inhabitants of Poland.

  [Excerpts] Wroclaw, 17 Jun--President Lech Walesa arrived 
in Wroclaw this afternoon, where he is to attend tomorrow's 
graduation parade of officer cadets of the Tadeusz Kosciuszko 
Mechanized Troops College graduating with the rank of 
lieutenant. [passage omitted] 
  When asked if he was not afraid that the left would win in 
the local government elections on Sunday, Walesa replied that he 
divided people into active and inactive, and the active people 
into less or more prepared. "Whatever we may say, inside the 
left, because it was in power for 50 years, people are better 
prepared. And that is normal for the times we live in. The 
right has to learn and learn again, and, in a short time, it 
will be in power. It depends on the learning--if there are a 
lot of prize pupils, it will be quicker," the president told 
journalists.

the Lucchini Steelworks in Warsaw. Jacek Gasiorowski, 
cochairman of the Solidarity strike committee, said this form of 
protest will last until the board begins negotiations with the 
strikers. 
  The dispute at the Lucchini-Warszawa Steelworks began on 9 
June. The steelworkers are demanding a pay raise of 30 percent 
and that modernization of the steelworks be undertaken by the 
Italian owner. The strike has been organized jointly by 
Solidarity and the National Trade Union Alliance [OPZZ].

<F P=106> [Interview with Polish Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski </F>
by correspondent Barbara Szczepula; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Szczepula] We claim that Poland's membership in 
the European Union [EU] will bring advantages not only to Poland 
but also to Europe. Is this claim indeed justified? 
  [Olechowski] The greatest advantage to all will come from a 
lasting reconciliation between Poles and Germans, along the 
lines of the French-German reconciliation. It will mean the 
elimination of a source of potential conflicts at the center of 
the European Continent. 
  The second advantage will stem from the fact that Poland's 
accession to the EU will enhance Europe's potential for 
competition with other economic centers around the world. This 
is because Poland will bring to the EU certain new resources, 
such as, for example, the highly qualified but still inexpensive 
labor force. This will result in lowering the average production 
costs throughout the EU's entire territory and also bringing 
down the prices of the goods manufactured there--which, in turn, 
will make them more competitive. 
  Poland's integration into the EU will also enhance the 
wealth 
of Europe's cultural and civilizational assets. I am referring 
here to our particular type of creative sensibility, which is 
different from its Mediterranean, English, and German 
counterparts. We bring to Europe our own styles and currents in 
the literary, musical, and visual arts. In other words, we 
simply bring our own identity. This is because we must not view 
Europe exclusively in terms of economic achievements and modern 
products; after all, it is true that our production record in 
these spheres is still comparatively low. 
  [Szczepula] In your opinion, is the date of Poland's 
accession to the EU a distant prospect? We recently saw a 
report by a U.S. scientist, Richard Baldwin, who asserts firmly 
that we should not entertain any dreams of Poland becoming an EU 
member during the next 20-30 years because our country is simply 
too poor and its agrarian structure is far too antiquated. On 
the other hand, we have been estimating that we might be joining 
the EU by the year 2000. 
  [Olechowski] If the EU membership was restricted 
categorically to wealthy countries, neither Greece nor Portugal 
nor Spain would have been accepted in the first place--nor, for 
that matter, somewhat earlier, would Italy have. I believe that 
the most important criterion is that of similarity of the 
political and economic situation of the particular aspiring 
country and the already existing European Community. That would 
entail the requirement for democracy and a market economy. 
Well, we know that Poland is moving in these very directions. 
  What does accession to the EU mean, in fact? It means 
opening up our goods and services market, and that is what we 
are already doing within the framework of the EU association 
agreement; it also means a joint capital market, labor market, 
and so on.... If there is one area I am concerned about, it is 
Polish agriculture. 
  Our agriculture is totally incompatible with the Western 
agricultural system. It would not be possible today to extend 
the European agricultural policy over our own farming system. 
In EU countries, some 3-7 percent of the population works in 
the agricultural sector, whereas in Poland the corresponding 
proportion is 25 percent. Our budget would not withstand an 
agrarian policy conducted according to the principles in force 
in the Union. In this sphere, we really do need more time. 
However, let me remind you that, when Spain was joining the 
EEC, its agricultural sector presented the greatest problem, 
too. Consequently, a longer period was allowed for adjustment 
in the agricultural sector, and somehow or other it managed to 
adjust. We will manage, too. In addition, we should remember 
that, because of the Maastricht Treaty, the EU not only is an 
economic community but also shares a common line in the spheres 
of foreign policy, security, and justice and internal affairs. 
In these areas, there are no obstacles at all to immediate 
integration. 
  [Szczepula] How do you assess the Polish public's 
readiness to accept integration into the EU? 
  [Olechowski] Polish people are open and ready for 
cooperation. The odd instances of xenophobic behavior can be 
explained by the present difficult economic situation in our 
country and a sense of frustration about the fact that, having 
achieved the truly momentous feat of overthrowing communism, we 
nevertheless failed to overcome quickly enough the 
civilizational recession we are still suffering now. However, 
let me repeat that, on the whole, we are open to new 
development. Even the popular saying, "A guest in the house 
brings God into the house," attests to our attitude. In 
addition, we are usually a tolerant people. Please note that 
Poland is the only state in this part of Europe that has signed 
good-neighbor agreements with all of its neighbors, despite the 
fact that we share a very complex historical past with four of 
them--namely, Russia, Germany, Lithuania, and Ukraine. This 
shows that we are good at arriving at a compromise. In a 
community of nations, the ability to give up a proportion of 
one's interests in the name of the common good is an extremely 
important asset. 
  [Szczepula] You said recently that the Baltic is now 
becoming as important for Europe as the Mediterranean. This 
offers a big chance to Poland and, in particular, our littoral 
regions. 
  [Olechowski] This promises to be a fascinating development. 
Until recently, the EU was associated exclusively with the 
Mediterranean region, but these days the Baltic Sea is becoming 
more and more important for Europe. Before long, there will be 
four EU countries with a Baltic coast: Germany, Denmark, 
Sweden, and Finland. Soon, they will be joined by Poland as 
well as Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This will certainly 
create a whole new situation. I believe that we will shortly be 
discussing that situation during the approaching forum of the 
Baltic States Council. 
  [Szczepula] Recently, Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski 
expressed his concern about the conviction, apparently prevalent 
in Poland, that it will be impossible for us to overcome the 
crisis without the backing of foreign capital. In his opinion, 
the situation is exactly the opposite: It will be Poland's 
emergence from the crisis that will attract foreign capital. Do 
you agree with this view? 
  [Olechowski] The thesis that we will not make it without 
outside help is incorrect because, with a relatively moderate 
influx of capital, we have already begun to emerge from the 
crisis. It is true that the eye is attracted more by the healthy 
and the rich than the sick and the poor, but, if we are to 
increase our wealth, certain conditions must be met. We do need 
foreign capital in order to expand our investment. Economists 
estimate that we could easily afford 5.8-percent economic growth. 
  [Szczepula] Beginning on 1 July, the EU will be presided 
over by the Germans. As I understand, you classify that 
development as advantageous for Polish integration aspirations. 
What can we count on with the Germans? 
  [Olechowski] The Germans favor us not only in their 
declarations but also in their actions because they themselves 
have an obvious interest in it. Consequently, it is natural 
that they should support Poland in its rapprochement with the 
EU. As we have already said, this rapprochement need not mean 
immediate membership because there is a need for a transition 
and adjustment period in the economy. However, the EU itself 
can accelerate the process of our conjunction by offering us its 
assistance in a more binding declaration. We are especially 
interested in hearing the EU member states declare unequivocally 
that they want to see Poland become a member of their community. 
This would mobilize us to more efforts and, at the same time, 
would oblige the EU member states to extend assistance to us in 
these efforts. 
  [Szczepula] As you outlined the main directions and 
principles of Poland's foreign policy in your Sejm address, you 
said that the one of the most pressing needs is to change the 
stereotyped image of Polish people to which foreigners 
subscribe. Do you believe that, over the past years, we have 
changed so much that these stereotypes are no longer accurate? 
  [Olechowski] Yes, I believe so. However, the way from 
changing a set pattern of behavior to changing people's 
stereotyped perception of our behavior is neither simple not 
obvious. Let us consider the expression "Polnische Wirtschaft" 
["Polish economy"; used in a derogatory sense]. We might think 
that these days the phrase "Polnische Wirtschaft" would begin to 
denote an economy that has outstanding results in the field of 
market transformation and that recorded the highest growth in 
Europe over the course of the past year. But it is not so. The 
phrase still carries strong pejorative connotations. 
Consequently, we must make an effort to advertise our 
achievements more widely and energetically, and to point out how 
much we have changed. We must convince Europe that we are 
Europeans. We must send it a set of our latest pictures. 
  [Szczepula] Let us hope that one of these new pictures will 
include the Europartenariat conference, which is taking place at 
this moment. Thank you for talking to us.

<F P=106> [Article by Edmund Szot: "Old Farm Machinery Is Selling, New </F>
Is Not"] 
  [Text] Polish producers of farm machinery assured us for 
many years that they were not afraid of foreign competition. The 
farm machines produced in the West, they said, are on average 
two to three times more expensive than ours, and the slightly 
cheaper machines from the East are two to three times worse than 
ours. 
  The possibility of importing used machines from the West was 
forgotten. They are generally much cheaper than the Polish 
machines, and the quality of materials used in them is equal to 
ours, as are their operating advantages. What happens, 
therefore, is that a farmer buys a machine that is already 
several years old but figures that, on his small farm, the 
machine will still work for 10 or perhaps even more years. The 
effects of this kind of thinking are felt most by the producers 
of combine-harvesters. 
  Last year Polish farmers bought 2,101 used 
combine-harvesters 
in the West, while, during this same period, the Plock factory 
was able to sell only 195 "Bisons." It is said that three times 
more farm trailers and beet harvesters were imported than were 
sold domestically. In other types of farm machinery, the effect 
of import was not as great; nevertheless, it was not looked upon 
with joy by domestic producers. For example, last year farmers 
bought the following equipment abroad: 374 spraying machines, 
1,800 plows, 247 cultivators, 570 harrows, 229 sowing machines, 
186 planters, 199 fertilizer spreaders, 510 presses for 
gathering hay and straw, 783 combines and diggers for gathering 
potatoes, 332 root toppers and combines for gathering beets, 14 
manure spreaders, 3,023 farm trailers, 468 minitractors, and 
3,340 tractors. And, although the above figures include both new 
and used equipment, one can guess that most of these machines 
have already done their job for the bauer [German word for 
farmer] and are now helping the farmer in Poland do his 
work--because the imported machines come mainly from West 
Germany. Import from Austria, second on this list, is several 
times smaller. 
  The import of this used farm machinery is causing Polish 
producers a great deal of trouble. Union members in the farm 
equipment factories recently protested against it, and the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Food Management is also looking at 
it with displeasure. In the past, it supported the attempts to 
protect domestic production of tractors, and today the import of 
tractors of the type produced by "Ursus" carries a 35-percent 
duty (on the import of others, the duty is 15 percent). 
  There is only a 6-percent border tax on the import of used 
farm machines, which is too small an impediment. And so other 
methods of halting or limiting the import of used machines are 
being sought. A requirement to obtain a so-called energy 
certificate has been instituted, and now there are plans to 
require possession of a "B" symbol, which machines that fulfill 
Polish work-safety requirements receive. 
  "There is a proposal that the Ministry of Foreign Economic 
Cooperation request the Tribunal in The Hague to halt the sale 
to Poland of used combine-harvesters, says Jerzy Szymanski, 
deputy director of the department of land management and 
countryside infrastructure in the Ministry, but, after a year, 
the situation will return to its previous state anyway.

  [Text] Special U.S. envoy Charles Redman held talks with 
Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Presidency; Presidency member Ejup Ganic; and Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency in Sarajevo 
today. Nedzad Leko reports: 
  [Leko] After three-hour-long talks, only Charles Redman 
addressed the journalists, and said the following: 
  [Redman] "I took advantage of my visit to continue our 
consultations on a number of issues facing Bosnia today -- both 
political and economic -- and the reconstruction of Sarajevo and 
other parts of the country. This evening I am going to Zagreb 
where I will have a meeting with Mr. Akashi, President Tudjman, 
and members of the Croatian Government. I will spend several 
more days in Europe to continue consultations because we all 
believe that this is an important moment to continue working 
toward a more stable, and, we hope, lasting peace. The 
negotiations are very difficult, but we are working hard, and 
will continue to do that. You will probably see me here in 
Sarajevo again soon." 
  [Leko] Asked whether the maps on which the contact group 
worked over the past two days in London were discussed at the 
meeting, Charles Redman said: 
  [Redman] "I am not here in that capacity. These issues are 
obviously always very interesting and important. However, I am 
here for bilateral U.S.-Bosnian relations [as heard], and not in 
the context of the contact group."

  [Text] Commanders of the 1st, 3d, and 7th Corps of the 
Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Vahid Karavelic, 
Sakib Mahmuljin, and Mehmed Alagic -- met with Vitez Region 
Commander Filip Filipovic at a command of the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina today. They met to discuss the 
concretization of the military part of the agreement signed in 
Washington. In an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding, 
representatives of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] 
expressed interest in implementing the details regarding the 
formation of the joint Federal Army. 
  The effects of the truce signed between the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO on 25 February 1994 
that have been achieved so far represent a good-quality basis 
for realizing tasks issued by the Joint Command, and the regions 
covered by the 1st, 3d, and 7th Corps, as well as the Vitez 
Region are definitely important for their implementation in the 
field. On this occasion, attention was also focused on the 
joint activity of the forces of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the HVO in the struggle against chetniks. 
The commanders assessed that the talks today were extremely 
successful.

  [Text] Belgrade, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- Commenting on the 
cease-fire agreement signed in Geneva and the latest statements 
on possible maps dividing the Bosnian territory for tomorrow's 
edition of the Novi Sad daily DNEVNIK, Lieutenant Colonel 
General Ratko Mladic, commander of the main headquarters of the 
Srpska republic army, said that the Serb army in Bosnia had 
opted for a passive defense to the increasing number of 
Muslim-Croat attacks and provocations because it wanted to 
demonstrate that the Srpska republic was in favor of a peaceful 
political solution to the conflict in this way too. 
  Mladic said that the Muslims would perhaps respect the 
so-called cease-fire if they had a united political and military 
leadership, and if their Western mentors did not encourage the 
war option. 
  Commenting on demands for further Serb concessions, Gen. 
Mladic said that there would be no haggling over the towns that 
have always been Serb and are currently held by the Serbs, and 
that proposals to include clearly Serb towns in the "gray zones" 
were out of the question: Because it is obvious that they 
[Muslims and Croats] are trying to use Western support to gain 
what they could not win in a military way. There has to be a 
compromise, but all three sides must take part in it if 
permanent peace is the final aim. 
  The Serb side has demonstrated a maximum of cooperation so 
far but unfortunately this has not been received positively by 
the West. It has been interpreted as Serb weakness and 
compliance, and that is why fresh concessions are being 
demanded. Even vital Serb interests have been jeopardized in 
order to reach peace, but these interests -- a territorially 
integral Serb republic and its natural territorial link with the 
Serbian motherland -- will certainly not be abandoned. 
  Commenting on the arrival of soldiers from Turkey and some 
other Islamic countries in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gen. 
Mladic said that this has exposed NATO's, i.e., U.S. strategy 
because, being afraid of a new Vietnam, they are relying on 
their satellites: Croatian and Muslim armies and military forces 
of certain Islamic countries. However, if the Srpska republic 
comes under an armed attack, its army will respond with all 
available means, Gen. Mladic said in his interview for 
tomorrow's edition of Novi Sad DNEVNIK.

<F P=106> [Report by Hamiz Deronjic from Brcko] </F>
  [Text] The intensity of the Serbian aggressor's combat 
activities escalated on the Brcko battlefield last night. 
Sporadically but persistently throughout the night, the enemy 
used 60-mm mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, antiaircraft 
guns, and rifles to attack the defense positions of Brcko. The 
defense positions in Djukici, in the central part of the 
battlefield, and in Vranovaca were targeted the most frequently. 
  An enemy saboteur group was chased away in the region of 
Boderiste at approximately 2000 last night, and at 2200 the 
defenders repeated their success in thwarting an attempt by 
chetnik saboteurs to penetrate into the Vranovaca area. 
  The aggressor continues to encounter major difficulties 
mobilizing soldiers. Intelligence information suggests that, 
over the past month and a half, the Serbian aggressor has 
carried out a whole series of raids in Bijeljina and in nearby 
villages. The chetnik military police are rounding up potential 
military conscripts in apartments, on the streets, bus stops, 
and even in hospitals, regardless of their (?rank), profession, 
or health condition, to transport them to special training camps. 
  However, not even this latest aspect of mobilization has 
provided much of a chance for success for the aggressor. As 
soon as they arrive on the front, these forcefully mobilized 
soldiers of the so-called Srpska republic army desert the front 
lines in the Bosnian Sava Basin and Mt. Majevica at the first 
given opportunity.

  [Text] There has been no let-up in chetnik attacks on the 
battlefields in the Third Corps' operational zone. They 
launched fierce attacks yesterday, especially on the Mount Ozren 
and Vozuca battlefields, using all types of heavy artillery. 
Here is a report from the Third Corps press center: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] Dozens of shells hit 
Hajdarevici, (Brasnevine), Livade, and Kamenica, and hundreds of 
large caliber shells were fired on the defense lines along the 
entire front line. The Third Corps responded to these attacks, 
so the fighting around Vozuca raged all day yesterday. In 
addition to frenzied artillery attacks, the chetniks launched 
several unsuccessful infantry attacks in which they suffered the 
largest losses so far. We estimate that several dozen of the 
aggressor's dead soldiers remained in the no-man's-land between 
the front lines. Many of their wounded were abandoned during the 
disorderly retreat. The huge losses incurred by the chetniks 
during their attempts to capture strategic locations around 
Zavidovici, the aim of their offensive, are the reason for the 
daily calls for reinforcements. 
  In addition to the attacks on the Vozuca front, chetniks 
were 
also active on the Celic battlefield, where they stepped up 
provocations and occasionally opened fire from 82-mm mortars. 
The situation was similar in the Tesanj area, the free 
territories around Teslic, and Doboj, where the aggressor used 
infantry weapons and a (?D-1) tank to shell Kalosevici.

  [Excerpts] Doboj, 19 Jun (TANJUG) -- Muslim units have 
resumed attacks on Serb positions and residential areas along 
all frontlines in the Doboj region, the information service of 
the Srpska republic army's 1st Krajina Corps said this evening. 
[passage omitted] For the fifth day running, strong Muslim 
forces, reinforced by units from Zenica and Kakanj, are 
attacking Serb positions and villages along the Ozren-Vozuca 
front. The attacks are focused on the area between the Krivaja 
river and the southwestern part of the Ozren-Vozuca front where, 
with strong artillery and tank support, the Muslim forces are 
launching infantry attacks and using terrorist-sabotage groups 
in attempts to break through Serb lines and destroy all Serb 
villages. This is why a mass exodus of the Serb population has 
begun. 
  According to the statement, the Muslims are also attacking 
Serb defense lines in Vozuca from the direction of Banovici, 
Lukavac, Zivinice, and Tuzla. According to the statement, it is 
becoming more obvious that the UN Protection Force has been 
offering logistical and fire support in the area between Ribnica 
and Vijenac. A mass exodus of the population has also begun from 
this area after many civilians, mostly children and women, were 
killed in Muslim artillery attacks on their villages. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Petrovac, 17 June (TANJUG) -- The offensive launched 
by pro-Izetbegovic forces against positions held by Fikret 
Abdic's units in Cazin Krajina in northern part of the Bihac 
region has continued for the seventh day in a row, local Muslim 
media reports. 
  According to the same sources, last night remnants of the 
5th 
Corps of the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army launched an 
infantry and mortar attack against positions and residential 
areas controlled by the army of the Autonomous Province of 
Western Bosnia [APWB] from the direction of Djogici and 
Pajezitovici. The Abdic proautonomy forces repelled the attack 
without suffering any losses. 
  Alija Izetbegovic's forces resumed the attacks this morning 
from the direction of Zeljkovici, Porcici, Memici, and Liskovac. 
Later in the day fighting also took place in the Beganovici, 
Todorovo, and Pecigrad areas. 
  Local media in the Bihac region, loyal to Alija Izetbegovic, 
report that 5th Corps forces have been inflicting heavy losses 
on the army of the APWB and that both sides have suffered 
casualties.

<F P=106> [By Michel Moutot] </F>
  [Text] Hasici, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 19 (AFP) -- 
Maverick Moslem leader Fikret Abdic has his back to the wall as 
Bosnian Government forces, freed by a temporary truce with 
separatist Serbs, move to regain control in his fiefdom of 
Bihac. Near the frontline hamlet of Hasici, Abdic's men were 
hastily digging a new network of trenches Sunday following the 
news that the village of Todorov, three kilometres (two miles) 
down the valley, had just fallen to the Bosnian Army 5th Corps. 
The battle for the Bihac pocket in northwestern Bosnia, where 
the millionaire businessman has declared autonomy from Sarajevo, 
has stepped up as his Serb-backed forces fight desperately to 
contain the Bosnian Army advance. The guns in Bosnia, which 
elsewhere have fallen generally quiet since the temporary 
ceasefire of June 10, are still clearly audible in this 
"autonomous province" proclaimed by Abdic last September. With 
the ceasefire taking effect along the front line between 
separatist Serb and Bosnian Army forces, the Army's 5th Corps, 
entrenched in the southern part of the enclave, launched a new 
offensive which Abdic's raggle-taggle troops appear unable to 
contain. 
  UN military observers said that unless they received men and 
equipment from separatist Serbs in the neighbouring Krajina 
region of Croatia, Abdic's forces would be unable to contain the 
advance of the 5th Army Corps for much longer. Rebel troops in 
Hasici wore an air of unease as they manned their posts. "The 
last civilian fled this sector two days ago," the commanding 
officer explained nervously. Some of his men had no uniforms. 
The nearby woods and surrounding fields echoed with automatic 
weapons' fire. "The balance of forces is very unfavourable for 
Abdic, 500 men against 15,000, a group of men little better than 
a militia up against a war-hardened army," a UN observer said on 
condition of anonymity. UN reports say that Krajina Serbs have 
been shooting at the Bosnian 5th Corps for several days, despite 
denials by Abdic's spokesmen. "I'm not sure the support of Serb 
guns is enough to redress the situation," the UN observer 
commented. 
  In Velika Kladusa, Abdic's stronghold near the Croatian 
border, the dull thud of gunfire was clearly audible. These 
were 122mm or 132mm guns, according to a UN European officer. 
The 5th Corps has lost about 70 men in the battle for Bihac, 
diverse sources agree, and although the toll among Abdic's men 
is not known, it is likely to be much higher. Almost 400 of his 
troops have been taken prisoner. Several civilians fleeing the 
fighting were seen near Velika Kladusa on Saturday, the first 
sign of a collapse in morale in territory that he controls. 
"There is no massive exodus nor any housing problems for the 
time being," said Monique Fufelli, head of the local mission of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. "Houses are 
very dispersed in the rural region and people have been put up 
by relatives," she said.

  [Text] The Bihac Region is still the most troubled part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. As of last night, chetniks from the 
so-called Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina have been using 
howitzers to virtually destroy border areas in the Cazin 
Commune. Krivaja, Pjanici, Skokovi, Liskovac, Todorovo, and 
Golubovici are being targeted by the Serbian aggressor, who has, 
more and more, been substituting Abdic's treacherous 
paramilitary, which is in disorder. There have been many wounded 
civilians, some people have been killed, but nobody is assessing 
material damage any longer. Here is a report by Mirza Sadikovic: 
  [Begin Sadikovic recording] This is why the Command of the 
5th Corps made a statement again and the civilian authorities of 
the Bihac Region presented a new (?protest) about the open 
chetnik aggression, in fact carried out from another state, 
which the local UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] members have 
been watching calmly. 
  During the day, members of Abdic's treacherous phalanxes 
also 
continued their wild artillery attacks. Due to an energetic 
response by our fighters, they and their chetnik allies (?began) 
withdrawing artillery deeply into their territory, leaving a 
real wasteland in their wake. 
  Following this morning's energetic responses by the 5th 
Corps 
units, a large part of territories has been liberated, and one 
more entire company from the 2d Brigade, the so-called Kladusa 
National Defense, has been caught and disarmed. Large 
quantities of ammunition, equipment, and armament that Abdic 
especially received from chetniks were confiscated on the 
occasion. [end recording]

  [Text] The Bihac region was again today the least quiet 
part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. From their strongholds in the 
so-called autonomous region of Krajina, chetniks shelled the 
outlying districts of Cazin. They also targeted the wider area 
of Buzim. Although the members of Fikret Abdic's traitorous 
units were reinforced with chetniks among their ranks in their 
attacks on Pecigrad and Todorovo. Their attempts to recapture 
lost territory were in vain. Mirza Sadikovic reports: 
  [Sadikovic] The truth is rapidly finding its way to Velika 
Kladusa. This afternoon the fighters of the 5th Corps of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army liberated new territories as they were 
returning fire to constant artillery and infantry attacks 
launched by members of Fikret Abdic's forces, fully supported by 
the chetniks of the so-called autonomous region of Krajina. 
They also disarmed yet another group of some 100 soldiers of 
the self-styled people's defense of Velika Kladusa, thus 
bringing total disarray into its 1st Brigade. A considerable 
amount of artillery and infantry equipment, weapons and 
ammunition was captured in this operation. At the same time a 
large number of people have crossed into the liberated 
territory, while Fikret Abdic's war-mongering headquarters is 
being gripped by panic because even the private radio station of 
Velkoton [Velika Kladusa Radio] has started to disobey orders. 
  Overall, conditions are being rapidly created for the 
normalization of living conditions and the legality of the state 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina across the entire region of Bihac.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Government's Office for Displaced Persons and </F>
Refugees Warns: Western Bosnia Being Intensively `Cleansed'"] 
  [Text] "The latest convoys with a very large number 
of Croats and Muslims indicate that the Serb authorities in the 
occupied regions are continuing with ethnic cleansing, but also 
that Croatia is having an increasingly difficult time caring for 
such large numbers of refugees and displaced persons." 
  Zagreb--On Thursday, the government's Office for Displaced 
Persons and Refugees sent a letter to foreign embassies in the 
Republic of Croatia and to the media repeating the warning that 
it is at the limit of its abilities in caring for all the 
refugees, especially those who continue to arrive. "Once again 
we call on all international bodies, governments and government 
bodies, and the international political community to halt ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to help the Croatian state 
to care adequately for the approximately half a million 
displaced persons and refugees," the letter states. 
  The letter recalls that two weeks ago the office similarly 
warned of an intensification and continuation of quiet ethnic 
cleansing in western Bosnia, which the Serb authorities have 
been conducting for two years now, but which they have been 
intensifying in recent months. "We were prompted to send out 
this letter," it goes on, "by the increasingly frequent and 
ever-larger convoys with new refugees of non-Serb nationality 
from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Kotor Varos, Prnjavor, and Derventa, 
who seek refuge from violence in Croatia." 
  The latest such convoy, which arrived in Croatia with 600 
new 
Muslim and Croat refugees on Tuesday, 31 May through the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] checkpoint at Dragalic near Nova 
Gradiska, motivated the Office for Displaced Persons and 
Refugees to "warn about the same problem for the umpteenth 
time--ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia and the arrival of an 
increasing number of refugees in Croatia, and the inability of 
Croatia to care for all these people under current conditions." 
  "Especially worrisome is the fact that this convoy was again 
organized by the Serb authorities in Bosnia, through their 
Serbian Red Cross, literally deporting these people," the Office 
for Displaced Persons and Refugees emphasizes. 
  The letter also alleges that some of the people on the 
convoy 
had entry or transit permits for Croatia, but that there are 
indications that some of those permits were forged. The majority 
of the people arrived with only a little clothing, and around 
200 of them sought assistance from the Office for Displaced 
Persons and Refugees the very next day. "On Wednesday and 
Thursday, they were assigned mostly to the Gasinci refugee 
center near Djakovo, which meant that we were forced to overfill 
the already inadequate living quarters. We must note that 
neither the office nor any international body knew about the 
arrival of this convoy," the letter emphasizes. 
  "Based on the number of new refugees, the latest convoy is 
an 
indication that the arrival of the remaining Croats and Muslims 
from that part of Bosnia can be expected shortly. That would 
complete the ethnic cleansing of western Bosnia, and Croatia 
would be inundated with new refugees," according to the 
assessment of the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees. The 
office again warned that there are no new structures for 
organized housing and that the only solution is to house them in 
structures that are already overcrowded. In addition, an 
increasing number of hitherto privately housed displaced persons 
and refugees--of whom there are around 400,000--are seeking 
organized housing.

  [Text] Baghdad, 19 Jun (TANJUG) -- A Yugoslav delegation, 
headed by Milorad Unkovic, federal minister for economic 
relations with foreign countries and president of the group for 
economic and technical cooperation within a joint Yugoslav-Iraqi 
committee, held talks in Baghdad today with Iraqi Deputy Prime 
Minister Tariq 'Aziz. 
  During the talks, described as cordial, both sides expressed 
satisfaction over the cooperation between their countries so 
far, and prospects to promote it further when conditions make 
this possible. Global world problems after the end of the Cold 
War and its implications on the two countries were also 
discussed. 
  Milorad Unkovic briefed Tariq 'Aziz about the current 
political situation in Yugoslavia and the economic recovery 
program. He also explained to his host the position of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
and other war-torn parts of the former Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav 
minister stressed that Yugoslavia should be reintegrated in the 
international community as soon as possible. 
  The Iraqi deputy prime minister said that the parties in the 
conflict should show more flexibility in the talks in order to 
find a compromise solution leading to a lasting peace. 
  Radoslav Bulajic, deputy Yugoslav foreign minister, briefed 
Tariq 'Aziz on the international position of the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] and its foreign policy principles. The 
main direction of Yugoslavia's policy is that of peace, of 
resolving all conflicts peacefully and observing all 
international norms and the UN Charter, Bulajic stressed. The 
talks resume in Baghdad tomorrow.

<F P=106> [Interview with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav </F>
Jovanovic by Edouard Van Velthem; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Van Velthem] In the past week, the latest 
cease-fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina seems to be holding. Is this 
good news for Belgrade? 
  [Jovanovic] Certainly. We want to see a complete cessation 
of hostilities without any conditions and have been arguing for 
this for several months already. 
  [Van Velthem] From the start the Yugoslav Government has 
defended the European plan for the partition of Bosnia. Is it 
at the same time exerting pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to 
induce them to accept this peace process? 
  [Jovanovic] I do not believe this is necessary. The Bosnian 
Serbs are resolutely constructive in this respect. They 
accepted the 49 percent allocation of territory several months 
ago now during negotiations on the British aircraft carrier 
"Invincible," and confirmed this accord in Brussels when the 
Twelve submitted their action plan. Today, without making any 
objection in principle, they are primarily seeking to improve 
not the quantity but the quality of the territories allocated to 
each side. Radovan Karadzic reminded Andrey Kozyrev of this 
when he met with him in Moscow earlier in the week. 
  [Van Velthem] With respect to Russia, there is rather the 
impression of a coldness between Moscow and Belgrade since the 
angry outburst against the Bosnian Serbs by Mr. Churkin, Mr. 
Yeltsin's emissary. 
  [Jovanovic] That is a false impression. What happened 
between Mr. Churkin and Mr. Karadzic is purely a matter for 
them, we were only indirectly involved. Our relations with 
Russia remain good, there is mutual trust, and there is no lack 
of communication. 
  [Van Velthem] If political dialogue is renewed, are you 
going 
to demand guarantees on the lifting of sanctions against 
Belgrade? 
  [Jovanovic] We have always been calling for this. It is 
inseparable from progress in any peace process, the one is not 
possible without the other. We also insist that the question of 
lifting the embargo should be laid down in the agreement itself. 
I am not saying that it must be lifted immediately and 
automatically at the moment of signing, but it must be treated 
as an unavoidable international obligation. The peace agreement 
and the lifting of sanctions must be treated as twins in a sense. 
  [Van Velthem] What is today the economic situation of 
Yugoslavia under the embargo? 
  [Jovanovic] There has been a clear, even spectacular, 
improvement since the stabilization plan launched by Mr. 
Avramovic, now the head of the National Bank. We are still a 
long way from the day-to-day circumstances we would like, but 
there has been a clear change in the past four or five months. 
Hyperinflation has been checked, the dinar exchange rate is 
holding up, and prices are stable. The energetic efforts by the 
government to maintain this level has met with a much greater 
serenity on the part of the population than previously. There 
is also renewed respect for law and order, despite sporadic 
incidents that are the direct result of the proximity of the war 
in Bosnia. In short, compared with the tensions we previously 
saw, there has been a general calming process at work, economic, 
social, and even political. Most of the parties are coming 
together in support of a core of national and state interests. 
That was far from the case before. 
  [Van Velthem] In Bosnia itself, associations of Serb 
citizens 
are continuing to demand the preservation of the undivided, 
multiethnic state. Do you support such initiatives? 
  [Jovanovic] It is not a movement, it simply serves the 
pretensions of the Muslim authorities to be representative of 
Bosnia's three communities. There are a small number of Serbs 
there who are either "little collaborators" or people who are 
unable to choose their position faced with the Muslim 
authorities. But it is a marginal phenomenon. In Sarajevo, in 
Zenica, or in Tuzla, the silent majority of Serbs still present 
is simply waiting for the first opportunity to leave their 
ghetto and join the territory of the Srpska republic. It is a 
sad reality, but it must be acknowledged, and not only on the 
Serbian side: Among the Croats and the Muslims too, there is 
growing migration to return to regions controlled by their 
nationals. These areas have seen a fratricidal war. 
  [Van Velthem] Peace in Bosnia would not be enough to bring 
calm to the Balkans. Major questions remain open, Krajina or 
Kosovo in particular. 
  [Jovanovic] The Krajina question is a part of the general 
Yugoslav crisis. A procedure in three stages, which we support, 
has already been launched between Knin and Zagreb. The 
cease-fire has been achieved, the normalization of economic 
relations will follow within the next few days, and the field 
will then be clear to attack the most sensitive and most complex 
objective, a permanent political solution. 
  Kosovo on the other hand is a separate issue, distinct from 
the present Yugoslav crisis, internal to the Federal Republic 
grouping together Serbia and Montenegro. It is a problem of 
separatism that has existed for at least a decade. We have 
guaranteed wide-ranging cultural, territorial, and 
administrative autonomy to our two provinces, Voivodine and 
Kosovo. We have no problem in the north because the populations 
concerned exercise their prerogatives. In the south, on the 
other hand, the Albanians refuse all dialogue, reject democratic 
electoral procedures and boycott the institutions proposed to 
them. We have always said that national minorities have the 
right to develop their four principal identities, ethnic, 
religious, linguistic, and cultural, and these needs are assured 
by our new constitution. 
  [Van Velthem] Would this go as far as reestablishing the 
internal autonomy previously granted by President Tito? 
  [Jovanovic] Albanian leaders themselves admit that this is 
no 
longer possible. The models of the past have become inadequate 
for new circumstances. Yesterday's Yugoslavia no longer exists, 
and the international community that did all it could to achieve 
that should be the first to realize it.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Yugoslav dissident Milovan Djilas by </F>
Alessandro Curzi; place and date not given: "After Bosnia 
Anything Goes"] 
  [Text] [Curzi] You recently talked about three kinds of 
fascism -- the Serbian, the Croatian, and the Muslim -- and 
about the threats of contagion to huge areas of our continent, 
our Europe. But Europe seems to be distracted, concerned solely 
with its many various forms of selfishness. A strong right-wing 
tide exists in many countries. In Italy there has been talk 
about changing, shifting our country's borders eastward. What 
would you like to say to the Italian people now, in this 
situation? 
  [Djilas] I said there is a typically Balkan kind of fascism 
that I consider worse than the Mediterranean fascism, because it 
is full of racist elements. And it is racism not against 
colored people but against neighbors, similar people. More 
precisely, they do not embrace fascist ideology, but they use 
fascist methods. Of course, the protracted war in Bosnia and 
the existence of the methods I mentioned encourage the Right 
throughout Europe. Today the Right is enjoying a definite 
recovery almost everywhere, and especially in central Europe, 
France, and Germany. With regard to the question of borders, 
though I do not presume to give any advice or issue any 
messages, I would tell the Italian people that any change in 
this regard could have unimaginable and even catastrophic 
consequences for Italy. 
  [Curzi] In the former Soviet empire people seem already 
tired 
of post-communism -- especially in Poland and Hungary. The 
leader of the Right, a member of the Hungarian parliament, told 
me that there is no longer any fear of communism. What do you 
think motivates those people? What options will be taken in the 
years ahead? 
  [Djilas] There are many factors that influenced those 
elections. The countries that experienced the socialist 
revolution, such as Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, now have 
the greatest difficulties -- more so than the countries that 
were under the domination of the Soviet Union itself. These 
difficulties are due above all to these countries' ethnic 
structure; and let us not forget that the Soviet Union, now 
Russia, had strong imperialist tendencies. It will take a long 
time to overcome these tendencies; there must be a different 
kind of society that does not need imperialism. Russian society 
has not yet reached this stage of development; it is still a 
bureaucratic society with major problems regarding social 
changes. As for Hungary and Poland, the Left was victorious, 
but they are not Stalinist communists. The victory was won by 
reformist communists and young people who want freedom and 
social justice. Communism is a great movement that has always 
embodied different currents, but with the victory of Stalinism 
all these currents were eliminated, destroyed. We can say that 
Lenin's communism will never return, or will only return with 
minority groups. These groups exist in Serbia too, but they do 
not have a major political role. So the victory in Hungary and 
Poland can be explained in terms of those peoples' desire to 
salvage and develop certain values that existed during the 
communist era and that could be destroyed by a sudden transition 
to capitalism. This is the most important reason. Also, the 
parties of the Right and center have not proposed anything new; 
indeed, their ideas date back to the period before World War II. 
However, new ideas have been put forward by the Polish and 
Hungarian socialists. I believe that what happened in Hungary 
and Poland is a good thing because it tends toward democracy and 
free trade. 
  [Curzi] I would like to ask you another question, concerning 
ideology. Is it possible, on the eve of the year 2000, to still 
have hope in your ideals, the ideals of a socialism with a human 
face that will truly bring democracy throughout Europe and 
throughout the world? 
  [Djilas] The ideals of democratic socialism have never been 
formulated in a determined manner. I spoke in general terms, 
that is, I am in favor of democracy -- but the kind in which 
social problems are resolved. I believe that in Scandinavia 
they have been fairly successful in this, but we must not 
underestimate what has been done in the past 50 years in 
Germany, France, and Italy in the field of social affairs -- 
health, the right to education, and so forth. We live in Europe 
or, rather, "you" live in Europe, and I live here in Yugoslavia, 
where there is war; whereas in Europe nobody's life is in 
danger, nobody dies of starvation, and nobody is homeless or 
unable to study. Europe today is ideologically almost entirely 
social democratic, which means that the threat from the Right is 
even greater and that, unless we halt it, the consequences could 
be tragic. It is necessary to halt the right-wing extremists, 
who are opposed to the parliamentary system or in favor of 
limiting social rights. 
  [Curzi] With regard to the terrible war that is devastating 
the former Yugoslavia, what responsibilities does the West bear; 
what should Europe and the United Nations in particular do to 
resolve the problem and to initiate a peace that will be truly 
honored by the tormented peoples of the former Yugoslavia? 
  [Djilas] The war in Bosnia has prompted -- or, rather, 
revealed an internal crisis that already existed. The West's 
failure to respond brought about an extraordinary situation: 
After Bosnia anything goes. It is enough to be strong and to 
have a little political circumspection, and anything is 
possible. The international laws that govern conflicts and 
relations between states and peoples no longer apply. So unless 
order, by which I mean international order, is restored, the 
entire system on which all the Western values were built will 
continue to crumble. Nobody wants to do anything concrete. 
  [Curzi] I would like to ask you a personal question. Could 
you tell me a happy memory and a sad memory from your life? Let 
us start with the sad one, so that we can end this interview on 
a hopeful note. 
  [Djilas] My most tragic memory -- not even bad, but tragic 
-- 
was the death of my wife last summer. Throughout the years of 
persecution, isolation, and my son's exile, we became a single 
person. That was the most difficult moment in my whole life. 
My worst memory concerns my conduct when my case was discussed 
by the Central Committee. Indeed, it was very different from 
how I would have liked. 
  I recovered very quickly, but I had to pay for my mistake. 
That is how it is. If you are consistent and believe -- and I 
have always believed in communism -- you have to first throw 
yourself into the mire and then if you can, you stand up again 
and continue. As for my fondest memory, it is difficult to say. 
I think it has to do with my son, who spent 10 years in exile 
-- our meetings and then at last his return to Yugoslavia. I 
really think those were the most beautiful moments of my life. 
But I do not think that my life has been difficult or tragic. 
I chose my destiny. I decided everything, or almost 
everything. Of course, nobody can decide everything: I was 
also subject to conditions. Be that as it may, I made my 
decisions, and when you decide on your own, it is not easy.

    [Editorial Report] Without additional commentary, the 
Belgrade opposition political weekly VREME publishes on pages 12 
and 13 of its 30 May issue "18 Indications of Early Elections." 
Among them are the following: 
  --Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic visited the 
agricultural fair in Novi Sad, where he was welcomed by 
directors of agricultural combines and factories, tasted wine, 
and effusively praised farmers. 
  --In mid-May, for no apparent reason, the Serbian Assembly 
discussed sowing. 
  --The Government of Serbia decided to give one loaf of bread 
each day to the poorest citizens of Serbia for the next two 
months. 
  --City transportation in Belgrade is somewhat improved. 
  --Charges have been brought against a group of delegates of 
the Serbian Radical Party for having prevented an official from 
carrying out his duties in connection with the expulsion of a 
delegate from a session of the Chamber of Citizens of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) Assembly. 
  --A large group of foreign journalists were guests of the 
Serbian and federal governments, which tried to "sell" the 
journalists the "truth about Serbia" and "flooded" domestic news 
media about their efforts. 
  --Four political parties (the Serbian Renewal Movement, the 
Democratic Party, the Democratic Party of Serbia, and the 
Serbian Radical Party) have announced an initiative to have 
Radoman Bozovic, president of the Chamber of Citizens of the FRY 
Assembly, dismissed. 
  --"Belgrade diplomatic circles" announce the lifting of 
sanctions against the FRY "as early as 30 May" according to a 
TANJUG report. 
  --Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, announced 
that the party will organize a "Week of Struggle Against 
Sanctions." The action started with Djindjic and the party's top 
leaders making voluntary blood donations. "This is apparently 
the first case of the leaders in a national campaign giving 
blood--usually the blood is sought from the people." 
  --G. Kalajic, "ideologist of the Serbian fascists," praised 
Mirjana Markovic, wife of Slobodan Milosevic, and sent her a 
message saying that differences between the rightists and 
communists are much smaller than the chasm that separates those 
two groups from "corrupt European liberals." 
  --The two "kums" (Serbo-Croatian term for baptismal 
godfather 
or best man at a wedding, which denotes a special relationship 
or bond) Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian Radical Party, 
and Vuk Draskovic, leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, have 
made peace without "cancelling out the programmatic differences" 
between the two parties.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 17 (TANJUG) -- Zoran Djindjic, 
president of the opposition Democratic Party (DS) in the 
Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, said Friday that the preliminary 
version of the map for territorial division of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina was unacceptable for the Bosnian Serbs. 
Djindjic told a press conference in Belgrade that political 
entities created after Bosnia-Herzegovina's division had to be 
viable and connected territorially. "The preliminary version 
takes into consideration only the Moslem-Croat territorial 
entity while the Serb entity is discriminated," he said. 
  The contact group for Bosnia -- which includes 
representatives of the United States, Russia and the European 
Union -- is preparing a plan for Bosnia's division granting 51 
percent of the territory to the Moslem-Croat federation and 49 
percent to the Srpska republic. 
  When the proposal is adopted by the foreign ministers of the 
countries represented on the contact group, it will be presented 
to the warring sides as an ultimatum. 
  It is strategically important that the cease-fire hold, said 
the DS president. 
  The truce shows that the international community has chosen 
to begin a territorial delineation, he said and added that this 
was not irrelevant because two concepts had been on the table so 
far -- the Serb, proposing a territorial demarcation, and the 
Moslem, proposing a unitary Bosnia. The one-month cease-fire 
agreement, signed in Geneva last week, took effect on June 10.

  [Editorial Report] In an article published in Belgrade in 
BORBA on 19 May, page 5, under the title "Minister Favors Some, 
Ignores Others," the Independent Association of Journalists of 
Serbia [NUNS] points out that a recently proposed law which 
would require all news media to obtain government approval prior 
to receiving financial support from any foreign source proves 
that "the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has 
not abandoned its idea of achieving complete control over all 
the media in the country." The media which might be granted such 
approval would be required to identify their published materials 
and their radio and television programs as being financed by a 
foreign source. This requirement, according to NUNS, "represents 
an attempt to satanize the media which are not favored or 
financially supported by the government." NUNS also points out 
that Ratomir Vico, minister of information of the Republic of 
Serbia, had not even responded to their request for a meeting. 
On the other hand, NUNS adds, he has offered his full support to 
the Association of Journalists of Serbia, an organization that 
was "unexpectedly reactivated following a prolonged period of 
inactivity." Thus, NUNS accuses the minister of favoring one 
association while ignoring another. 
  On the same page, BORBA publishes another article titled 
"Death Sentence for the Independent Media." In this article, the 
International Federation of Journalists [MEN] states that "if 
this law is adopted, it will mean a death sentence for the only 
independent voices existing in the country and refute all 
illusions that the Serbian Government has any concern for 
democracy." MEN further notes that the government's main 
objective is to use this new law against such periodicals as 
BORBA and VREME and such radio stations as "B 92" and "Studio 
B," which in many respects depend on foreign support.

  [Text] The VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Movement for Macedonian National Unity] 
considers that the threats to the security, autonomy, and 
independence of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] from the frequent border 
incidents and activities of Serbian forces on the border with 
Macedonia represent a serious problem, and that the urgent 
protection of the sovereignty of the Macedonian state is 
required, in conformity with the basic postulates defined by 
international law and international agreements. 
  The pro-Serbian leftist government coalition, which fully 
controls the Macedonian Assembly, has not yet proposed any legal 
measures to define and support Macedonia's state border with 
Serbia, as well as with other states, and thus respond to these 
activities of our northern neighbor. Because of all this, the 
northern state border is still being treated as an 
administrative border. 
  The VMRO-DPMNE considers that the government of Branko 
Crvenkovski and Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov are most 
responsible for not resolving this situation, because so far 
they have not done anything to contribute to adapting the 
Macedonian legislation to international law on state sovereignty 
and the protection of territorial integrity. According to 
VMRO-DPMNE, there can be no justification for this leftist 
ruling coalition, which has not yet passed a new law on the 
control of the state borders, on protecting the inviolability of 
the entire length of the borders and thus defining a way for 
solving border violations and incidents, which are occuring 
increasingly frequently.

Macedonia. Representatives of this party have been guests of the

all orthodox and Christian peoples in the Balkans, as a part of 
the all-European integration process, the party leader Vasil

view with the Serbian Socialists on all main issues concerning 
the Balkan political crises. He also pointed out he had been 
assured Macedonia is not faced with any danger coming from its 
northern brotherly neighbor. 
  Representatives of the party were also received by the 
Serbian Government and the Holy Synod of the Serbian Orthodox

  [Text] The Democratic Party of Yugoslavs in Macedonia 
[DPJM] has protested after the Macedonian authorities banned the 
entry and stay in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] of some Serbian Orthodox priests, and 
considers that this cannot be compatible with a democratic 
society. 
  The DPJM has also protested because yesterday some other 
Serbian Orthodox priests were not allowed to enter Macedonia as 
civilians either, which represents a serious violation of the 
democratic and constitutional principles of Macedonia, and it is 
another instance of the tough repression of the population of 
Serbian nationality, which has already been deprived of its 
rights. 
  The DPMJ has also protested the irrational and, in its view, 
irresponsible statements by the Head of the Macedonian Orthodox 
Church Mihail.

  [Text] A Macedonian youth was stabbed during the clashes 
between Macedonians and members of the Albanian ethnic minority 
in Tetovo. The tension between the two ethnic communities is 
rising in light of the upcoming public census in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  The Albanians, who officially constitute 23 percent of the 
population, boycotted the last census in 1991. They claim they 
account for 40 percent of Macedonia's population. In western 
Macedonia, which is seen as a potential hotbed of clashes, the 
Albanians make up approximately 70 percent of the population.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Murder in Tetovo"] </F>
  [Excerpts] Yesterday, Vase Trpcevski from Tetovo was 
killed in a street fight after an argument between two groups of 
Albanians and Macedonians [[The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM]. The Interior Ministry issued a public 
announcement, explaining a street fight broke out at about 2100 
[1900 GMT], near the Colourful Mosque in Tetovo, involving a 
group of about 12 older underage Macedonians and about 15 
Albanian citizens, which ended in murdering the 18 year-old Vase 
Trpcevski, who was stabbed near his heart. The group of 
Macedonians was coming back from a party and was attacked by a 
bigger group of Albanians. Two of the attackers Suleiman 
Skondori and Adnan Sodiu were arrested at the border crossing of 
Deve Bair during an attempt to leave for Turkey. The police 
also imprisoned Rusit Rusiti and Menduh Zendeli, possible 
murderers. 
  Eight Macedonians were treated at the Tetovo medical centre. 
Two of them are kept for hospital treatment and the others were 
released. [passage omitted] 
  Tetovo citizens, especially the Macedonians, are unanimous 
in 
their condemn of the crime. They also reacted against the city 
police preventing doctors to provide first aid for the injured 
Macedonians on the spot. The situation in Tetovo is presently 
calm, but tense. 
  On the occasion of young Vase Trpcevski's death, his family 
received telegrams of deep condolences by President Gligorov, 
parliament president Andov, and Prime Minister Crvenkovski.

Occupation of Kuwait"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Czech Republic estimates the level of 
its losses caused by the military invasion and the subsequent 
occupation of Kuwait by Iraq at $385 million and has submitted 
the relevant documentation to the UN Commission for 
Compensations. A total of 19 Czech organizations have filed 
claims for $333 million. Most of the damage results from unpaid 
deliveries and projects. The largest claim, for $108 million, 
comes from Technoexport Prague a.s. Other claimants include, 
for example, the Zetor Brno state enterprise and Strojexport 
Prague, which claim $90 million each. The list of claims 
submitted to the UN Commission also includes the Finance 
Ministry's claim for $52 million. The Czech ministry (and its 
federal predecessor) has paid this sum to Czech organizations in 
order to alleviate their losses. Most of this sum was used to 
pay interest on loans for claims "frozen" in Iraq, Miroslav 
Havel, director of the State Budget Section at the Ministry of 
Finance, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. Money for this purpose will 
also be allocated from the state budget's contingency reserves 
this year. Within the framework of the Czech Republic's overall 
claims, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demands compensation of 
$11,000 for losses incurred by the former Federal Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs during the evacuation of its staff or due to the 
loss of some embassy property. In the opinion of M. Havel, the 
compensation for damage by the UN will be a protracted affair 
with an uncertain outcome.

  [Text] Plzen--The Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi [Nuclear 
Engineering] Plzen company will supply compact grids for the 
spent fuel pool of the Rivne nuclear power station in Ukraine. 
Twenty percent of the order has already been paid for. Another 
60 percent of the payment is due to arrive in the next few days. 
If it does, Jaderne Strojirenstvi will supply the corresponding 
part of the ordered equipment by the end of June. 
  According to Vaclav Lobovsky, director of Skoda Jaderne 
Strojirenstvi, this contract should, first and foremost, explore 
the ability of Ukrainian nuclear power stations to pay. Jaderne 
Strojirenstvi had signed a letter of intent with Derzhkomatom 
[State Committee for Nuclear Energy], their umbrella 
organization. 
  Skoda hopes to obtain $150 million (4.5 billion korunas) 
worth of orders on the basis of this contract, to be realized 
gradually until the end of the year 2000. This is the sum at 
which the letter of intent estimates the needs of the four 
Ukrainian nuclear power stations equipped with VVER 
[water-moderated water-cooled] reactors--Rivne, South Ukrainian, 
Zaporizhzhya, and Khmelnytskyy. 
  According to Karel Wagner from Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi, 
who participated in a seminar on Czech regulatory drives in the 
South Ukrainian nuclear power station, Skoda's program has been 
received well. By its design, the equipment offered by Skoda 
also enhances the nuclear power stations' safety. 
  In addition to reactor grids and drives for regulatory 
systems, Skoda Jaderne Strojirenstvi wants to assert itself on 
the Ukrainian market with hermetic cable bushings [kabelove 
hermeticke pruchodky], spare parts, and operational inspections 
of the pressure vessels.

<F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta] </F>
  [Text] This week, the RDP Group arms company has withdrawn, 
at the very last moment, its application for a license to trade 
in military material. The Ministry of Industry and Trade has 
confirmed this. The arms consortium took recourse to this 
maneuver after it learned that government authorities were about 
to reject the issuance of the arms-trading permit. 
  The Defense Ministry had serious objections against Jan 
Vlcek, director of the company. At the former Federal Defense 
Ministry, he was engaged in X-Trade, a subsidized organization 
of the Army that sold off surplus military technology to foreign 
countries. 
  In view of the dubious activities of the representatives of 
this consortium in Iran recently, the Foreign Ministry wanted to 
support the stance of the Defense Ministry. In its confidential 
document, they even said that the RDP Group did more harm than 
good to the interests of the Czech Republic. "We recommend that 
this company be urged to show `restraint' in its activity," 
diplomats said. 
  The licensing administration of the Ministry of Industry and 
Trade was to announce a negative stance to the RDP Group by the 
end of this week. In that case, the RDP Group consortium, which 
associates about 40 arms enterprises, was under the threat of 
not being able to conduct trade in arms at all for at least a 
year. According to the law, a firm whose application has been 
denied must wait one year to reapply for permission to export 
military material. 
  Not being allowed to trade in military material would 
significantly damage the RDP Group because trade in arms was one 
of its goals when the consortium was established--apart from 
coordinating domestic production of military technology and 
participating in the replacement of the Army's arsenal. Experts 
estimate that, in the course of one year, the arms company would 
lose transactions worth millions of korunas. 
  The RDP Group wants to reapply for the trade license in 
military material as soon as possible. After former diplomat 
Viktorie Hradska has been appointed to Vlcek's position, arms 
manufacturers expect that ministries will be more inclined to 
meet them halfway.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Bulgarian </F>
Socialist Party Supreme Council, by Teodora Encheva; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [Encheva] Mr. Videnov, do you want to be prime 
minister? 
  [Videnov] I want Bulgaria to have a lasting, efficient, and 
leftist-centrist government. I think that the voters will soon 
resolve this issue. I have often said that Bulgaria will hardly 
be an exception to the other East European countries, where the 
composition of leftist-centrist cabinets is formed after complex 
coalition negotiations that often have an unexpected or 
unconventional result. 
  [Encheva] I meant your personal ambition. 
  [Videnov] I have neither sick ambitions nor an inferiority 
complex. Both the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] and I could 
cope with such a challenge. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Why did you sacrifice Georgi Pirinski as a member 
of the BSP Executive Bureau? You know that he will not work 
together with Doncho Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. He 
repeatedly stated that their economic policy concepts are 
incompatible with his. Could you comment on him withdrawing his 
candidacy and resigning as deputy chairman of the BSP 
parliamentary faction? 
  [Videnov] Georgi Pirinski did not know the entire membership 
of the Executive Council, but he was informed about Doncho 
Konakchiev and Nikola Koychev. I am sure that this is not the 
reason he withdrew his candidacy. I rather think that his 
personal decision was influenced by the plenum's discussion, 
which showed that the new membership is firmly determined to 
implement the congress decisions regarding early elections in 
the fall. 
  [Encheva] Do you mean that Georgi Pirinski does not want 
elections? 
  [Videnov] Only he could answer this question. I think that 
his decision was influenced by certain economic measures that 
the cabinet and parliament are adopting now. They could produce 
a positive effect in the fall, if we have political stability. 
However, it would be an illusion to hope that things will 
proceed at a good pace in the legislative sphere. I would not 
dramatize his resignation from the post deputy chairman of the 
parliamentary faction, because he said that he wants to work in 
the Supreme Council organs, and as far as I am concerned, I will 
help him. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Could you say when there will be elections? 
  [Videnov] The elections issue must be resolved this year. 
Theoretically, this proposal was already discussed by the BSP 
leadership last fall. Now we are certain that early elections 
will take place. 
  [Encheva] Prior to the congress you were more categorical 
regarding having the elections this fall.... 
  [Videnov] Technically, the end of October-beginning of 
November is the best time for elections. Afterward it will be 
too late to develop an election campaign, form a new cabinet, 
prepare the new budget, and so forth. Naturally, not all 
political forces take those criteria into consideration and 
surprises of all kinds are possible. Therefore, the degree to 
which one could be categorical is limited. [passage omitted] 
  [Encheva] Do you think that the influence of Aleksandur 
Lilov and Andrey Lukanov over you has decreased after the 41st 
BSP Congress? 
  [Videnov] The influence of noted BSP figures over party 
policy has always been implemented through their participation 
in the party's leading organs and not through the party chairman. 
  [Encheva] Do you think that Aleksandur Marinov will form an 
ideological current within the BSP, as he said in his STANDART 
NEWS interview? 
  [Videnov] No, I do not think that our ideological 
differences 
are that great. The BSP does not need a new ideological 
current. The time when inner party and personal problems were 
resolved in such a manner is over, therefore, I think that such 
a step has a very low probability. I think that this is rather 
intensified activity on the eve of the referendum on the party 
program. I assume that Mr. Marinov will be among the 
participants in the discussion related to the party program.

  [Text] After signing the convention between the Romanian 
Government and the Alfa Cartel National Trade Union 
Confederation, Florin Georgescu, state minister and finance 
minister, and Alfa Cartel leader Bogdan Hossu made the following 
statements to the press: 
  [Begin Georgescu recording] The negotiations that concluded 
tonight took place, most of the time, in a constructive 
atmosphere, and in our opinion their results are in accordance 
both with the need to continue and accelerate reform, on the one 
hand, and, on the other, with the imperative of raising the 
standard of living of all our citizens. 
  Practically, the conclusions contained in the convention 
concluded between the government party and the trade union party 
establish the principles and the methods of negotiating salaries 
over the coming time, but this has to be in accordance with the 
performance of our economy and with the financial means of the 
companies in question. Similarly, the convention also 
establishes methods and ways by which we can avoid that the 
macroeconomic situation, which has became quite stable over the 
recent months, should be endangered by the phenomenon of 
inflation, the evolution of the national currency exchange rate, 
and everything they imply, regardless of how future negotiations 
between the employers and the trade unions will evolve. 
  In our opinion, the final form of the convention concluded 
between the two parties observes both the principles of market 
economy, which are being strengthened in our country, and the 
democratic way they manifest themselves for the parties engaged 
in negotiations and in the erection and consolidation of the 
market economy. [end recording] 
  [Begin Hossu recording] After three days of intense and 
sometimes quite tense negotiations, the two parties managed to 
finalize them by signing tonight a convention which manages to 
solve the unblocking of the admissible funds [deblocarea 
fondului admisibil], in view of negotiations on the salary 
system at the level of companies. Besides, we obtained an 
increment of the minimal salaries throughout the economy, which 
will have beneficial effects, above all for pensioners and for 
unemployment benefits granted to the jobless. 
  On the other hand, we established that over the next week we 
could possibly finalize, under the patronage of the prime 
minister, the negotiation of the collective labor contracts at 
the national level. 
  The government decisions that used to regulate the 
retirement 
of employees and the social protection granted to certain 
disadvantaged professional categories, such as the miners or 
employees in the chemical and the oil processing industry, were 
altered so that the employees in question are now protected. 
  Considering that during the negotiations we concretely 
solved 
our four claims, our national trade union confederation, with 
the consent of the participants in the rally, decided to suspend 
this action. Everyone is to leave for home and clear Victory 
Square. [end recording]

  [Text] Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of 
Croatia, held talks with Charles Redman, the U.S. President's 
special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and U.S. Ambassador to 
Croatia Peter Galbraith in the Presidential Palace in Zagreb 
this evening. 
  They exchanged opinions on the political and economic 
situation in Croatia and the peace process in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Asked if they had discussed the territorial 
division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whereby the Croat-Bosniak 
Federation would be given 51 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina and 
the Bosnian Serbs 49 percent, the Croatian president said that 
is the only reasonable solution. 
  Redman said that they had discussed the division only in 
general terms, while President Tudjman was informed about what 
is being attempted by the contact group and with ministers [as 
heard]. We are not at the stage where we can propose anything, 
Redman stressed, but we are working hard at it.

  [Text] General Marinus Wilmink, commander of Allied NATO 
Land Forces in Central Europe, ended his four-day official visit 
to Slovakia with talks in the Defense Ministry in Bratislava. 
He also met with journalists at a brief news conference. 
Bernard Roztecky has the details: 
  [Roztecky] After his talks with Andrej Sabol, state 
secretary 
in the Slovak Defense Ministry, Gen. Marinus Wilmink assessed 
his first official visit to Slovakia as very valuable. He 
appreciated the mutual understanding as well as the sharing of 
views on some military issues. He pointed out that future 
cooperation will benefit from such trust. 
  According to General Julius Humaj, Slovak Army commander in 
chief, who was present at the concluding talks, cooperation will 
take place in three main areas: the development of new 
organizational structures in our Army--that is, a transition to 
the system of army corps and brigades similar to that of NATO. 
The other areas cover the introduction of logistics systems in 
army units and simulated training and other training for battle, 
areas in which NATO has rich experience. 
  State Secretary Andrej Sabol also assessed the political 
aspect of the talks, especially in relation to our participation 
in the Partnership for Peace program. He recalled that our 
initiative to set up a NATO consultation center in Bratislava 
met with Gen. Wilmink's understanding. The general appreciated 
the need for more intensive sharing of experience. 
  The commander of NATO land forces in Central Europe will 
leave for NATO headquarters in Germany this afternoon.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 19 (AFP) -- Troops of Bosnia's 
mainly Moslem army fired on a British UN observation post in 
Gorazde, the United Nations said Sunday [19 June] as it reported 
a growing number of ceasefire violations. Most of the clashes 
are between the Bosnian army and Serb secessionist forces, and 
northeastern Bosnia has seen the biggest increase in military 
activity over the past three days, UN spokesman Eric Chaperon 
said. 
  However, on Saturday [18 June] night Bosnian army forces 
opened fire on a British UN observation post in the eastern 
enclave of Gorazde, Chaperon said. The British force fired 
back, he added without saying if there were casualties. At dawn 
Sunday Bosnian Moslem and Serb forces also clashed in Gorazde, 
he added. [passage omitted] 
  Chaperon said the head of UN forces in Bosnia, General Sir 
Michael Rose of Britain, sent a letter Saturday to the 
commanders of the Bosnian army and Serb forces asking for strict 
observance of the ceasefire. Rose cited incidents in which one 
or the other side had broken the truce. [passage omitted] 
  Chaperon also reported that a Danish UN medical team, due to 
travel from Sarajevo to Gorazde, has been stuck in between for 
five days at the Serb-held town of Rogatica after refusing to 
submit to Serb searches of their equipment.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Cadastre: Serb Soldiers Deep Inside </F>
Republic of Macedonia Territory"] 
  [Text] The Serbian soldiers who have taken positions on 
the strategic peak Straza, with an altitude of 1,703 meters, in 
the locality of Cupino Brdo, near Kriva Palanka, have penetrated 
between 550 and 600 meters into the territory of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
This can be concluded from the cadastre of the Kriva Palanka 
Geodesy administration. The sketches of this region, according 
to the Kriva Palanka Geodesy administration, were made in 1967, 
and processed in 1968. 
  According to these sketches, that is, the one from the 
cadastre county of Luke, of the Kriva Palanka local assembly, 
the peak Straza, with [words indistinct] elevations at 1,702 and 
1,703.5 meters above sea level, is at a distance of 550 meters 
air line from the neighboring cadastre county of Surdulica, 
which is on FRY territory. 
  Today's VECER writes that there is still no official 
information as to what is happening on the peak Straza and when 
the Serbian soldiers came there. It is found out that the 
members of the Macedonian Army, who control the border region, 
have sent information to the Defense Ministry, however, it has 
still not been officially issued. 
  There are some assumptions that the Serbian soldiers have 
been at these positions for about a month, and they were first 
noticed by the villagers from Podrzikonj and Luke, who were not 
allowed by the Serbian soldiers to approach their land parcels, 
which are in the immediate vicinity of the border. After the 
news about the Serbian positions on Macedonian territory, NATO 
observation patrols, made up of U.S. soldiers, stationed 
themselves near the Macedonian Army camp, two days ago, and 
their intention is to stay in this volatile region for a while.

  [Text] Prague--Economic losses incurred by the Czech 
Republic as a result of UN sanctions against the warring Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] exceed $290 million--that is, 8.7 
billion Czech korunas [Kc]--states Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
in his reply to an interpellation of Communist Party Deputy 
Vratislav Votava. 
  Although the former CSFR made use of the possibility of 
asking the United Nations for partial compensation of the 
damage, along with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine, its 
negotiations with the UN Security Council have not produced any 
results. "In view of the UN's difficult financial situation, 
the possibilities of compensation must be assessed 
realistically," Klaus states. 
  Losses in the sphere of foreign trade amount to $259.4 
million. Of this sum, $190 million (Kc5.7 billion) are foreign 
trade enterprises' claims in former Yugoslavia. The loss of 
another $69.4 million (Kc2.1 billion) is due to the failure by 
the republics of former Yugoslavia to cover their debt stemming 
from the clearing account between former Yugoslavia and the 
Czech Republic. 
  One-off damages suffered by organizations of the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade amount to $17 million (Kc510 million). They 
result from nonliquid company claims and the costs associated 
with the halting, owing to the UN sanctions, of some planned 
deliveries to former Yugoslavia, work on which had already 
started. 
  Damage in the sphere of transportation represents Kc82.9 
million, of which some Kc80 million is accounted for by the loss 
of fees in railway transportation for transit from former 
Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the Czech Republic profits from 
the fact that civilian aircraft are banned from flying over the 
territory of Serbia and Montenegro and use international air 
routes over the territory of our Republic, for which they pay 
overflight fees. 
  Losses incurred from the stricter regime for transit of 
natural gas to Croatia and Slovenia have been estimated at $13.7 
million.

<F P=106> [Article by Marian Dudinsky: "The Zuzana Howitzer Is </F>
Selling Like Hotcakes; World Hit of Slovak Arms Industry 
Presented at Jelsava"] 
  [Excerpts] A major festivity took place at the 3d 
Artillery Brigade at Jelsava the day before yesterday. Three 
"generals" of the present Slovak Army were presented to the 
public there, two of whom are women! The first is ZUZANA 
[Slovak form of "Susanne"], the second DANA, and the third is 
Rocket Launcher--Model 70. It is self-evident that we are 
talking about arms systems in our Army's arsenal, among which 
"Sue," a self-propelled cannon howitzer, is the absolute hit. A 
lot of praise has been heaped on it at all international 
exhibitions at which it has been presented lately. 
  The 155-mm caliber, the very caliber that is also used by 
NATO armies, and the range of 40 kilometers, a distance for 
which air reconnaissance is required, place this weapon among 
the leading ranks in the world at present. This is also 
confirmed by the preliminary price of 30 million korunas [Sk], 
or $1 million (for potential foreign customers), per unit. Of 
course, this price is based on the assumption that we will be 
able to produce at least 100 pieces a year and that production 
starts immediately! Waiting in this area means waiting for 
bankruptcy. India alone has shown interest in 400 of these 
howitzers.... And other interested parties are legion. 
  The second "general" is ZUZANA's predecessor, a 152-mm 
self-propelled cannon howitzer, model 77, code named "DANA." 
Its range is "only" 20 kilometers, but, during its 
presentation, one's ears, though plugged, were ringing 
handsomely. The assertion seems to be true that it may be 
enough to erect 10 to 20 of these monsters at the battlefield to 
deafen the enemy troops. They cost about Sk10 million apiece. 
  The 122-mm rocket launcher, model 70, is mounted on a Tatra 
813 chassis and equipped with 40 rockets (known as improved 
"katushas" [World War II Soviet-made rocket launchers]). Its 
range is also approximately 20 kilometers, but its price is a 
mere Sk7.5 million. However, a single shot costs up to Sk20,000! 
[passage omitted] 
  As is to be seen, Slovak arms manufacturers are beginning to 
recover from the woeful heritage of conversion imposed by Havel 
and to return to markets from which they had been pushed out by 
the so-called humanitarian ethics of federal policy, which 
pharisaically applied only to Slovakia.... 
  [Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 18 June on page 
3 carries a 150-word "r"-attributed report entitled "Targeted on 
Howitzers." According to the report, in a statement provided to 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA, Colonel Tomas Svec, chief of the Public 
Relations Department at the Army Command of the Slovak Republic, 
corrected the information contained in the above report as 
follows: "The Zuzana self-propelled cannon howitzer is not in 
the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic. The Army 
intends, however, to introduce it into its arsenal, as was also 
stated at Jelsava by the commander of the Army of the Slovak 
Republic. The information about Zuzana's price (Sk30 million) 
is also incorrect. This price is a very rough estimate from 
January 1993, when there was no experience with the development 
and production of such a high-quality combat system. The actual 
price is quite different."]

  [Text] Julian Garcia Vargas and Piotr Kolodziejczyk, 
defense ministers of the Kingdom of Spain and of Poland, signed 
a defense cooperation agreement today. 
  [Begin Vargas recording, in Spanish with passage-by-passage 
translation into Polish] We discussed all issues concerning 
military cooperation, and I think we can become partners in the 
European Union soon. [end recording] 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] This agreement sanctions the 
reality that has been a fact for some years now. Our close 
cooperation links have been in existence since 1990, with 
varying degrees of intensity. This agreement, unlike other 
standard bilateral agreements, does not contain any secret 
clauses. It simply constitutes a legal basis for making our 
cooperation more dynamic. 
  When it comes to our plenary talks, I would like to 
emphasize 
with great satisfaction that Minister Vargas said in a very 
clear and decisive way not only on his own behalf but also on 
behalf of the Spanish Government that Spain will forcefully 
support our aspirations toward integration into the West 
European structures, the economic and defense structures. [end

<F P=106> [Article by Janusz B.Grochowski: "Struggling With the </F>
Constitution"] 
  [Excerpts] Professor Janina Zakrzewska says that it 
is easier to say "no" than to answer a question on "how." That 
is probably the main reason the Third Polish Republic continues 
not to have a constitution. 
  Five years ago, many issues seemed much simpler. Everybody 
knew what society was protesting against. The June elections to 
the contract Sejm became a plebiscite putting the screws to the 
authorities of the authoritarian state. Even the communists 
themselves, or at least some of them, spoke against the 
so-called real socialism, and that made it possible to get down 
to evolutionary changes. 
<H5>  "At Last in Our Own Home" </H5>
  There were no major problems with making the ideological 
cosmetic changes to the basic law. The eagle was crowned again, 
and the adjective "socialist" was deleted. The idea of a 
lifelong friendship and military alliance with the Soviet Union 
was abandoned, which was made easier by the fact that the Soviet 
Union was just beginning to collapse. The Army was told to be 
apolitical, while "God, Honor, Motherland" was inscribed on its 
flags. 
  So adopting a new constitution of the Third Republic seemed 
like the easiest thing under the sun to do. It should be 
adopted as soon as one can write a fundamental law that would 
suit Polish needs and aspirations. But 3 May 1991 is the 
absolutely final deadline that cannot be violated, Professor 
Bronislaw Geremek used to say four years ago. 
  But, generally speaking, the task turned out to be much more 
difficult. When it came time to give some substance to concepts 
like "democracy," "state based on law," or "social justice" 
(which are favored by everybody, with virtually no exceptions), 
then everybody began to understand the concepts in his own way. 
And the longer the debate continues, the bigger the 
discrepancies that are emerging. [passage omitted] 
<H5>  President or Parliament </H5>
  [Presidential Aide] Professor Lech Falandysz argues that, in 
the transitional period in which Poland is right now, beyond 
doubt the country needs a president with quite substantial 
powers. For the period of the crisis, the country needs a 
system in which a relatively strong and stabilized executive 
authority will be acting alongside parliament, which, however, 
will not have an advantage over the executive authority. By the 
way, that would be just a natural consequence of the decision 
made by the Sejm, to the effect that the head of state is 
elected not by the National Assembly but by citizens in popular 
elections. 
  The proposal to subordinate the chief of the Polish Army 
General Staff directly to the commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces (the president) is an attempt at imposing precisely that 
kind of model. Efforts to grant decisionmaking powers to the 
National Security Council [RBN], which up to now was only an 
advisory organ to the head of state, are also in the same tone. 
As a result, the RBN would become a supergovernment whose 
orders would be binding on other authorities, including the 
Council of Ministers. 
  It is an echo of Lech Walesa's "buffer theory." The prime 
minister, being responsible in front of parliament, to some 
degree protects the president, who reserves only the most 
important powers for himself, including the right to dismiss the 
prime minister, explains Professor Falandysz. 
  But the problem is that practically no major political 
party, 
including the extraparliamentary ones, is willing to agree to 
such a concept. Both the right wing and the left wing, both 
post-"Solidarity" and postcommunist parties, are in favor of a 
parliamentary-cabinet type of system, under which it is the Sejm 
that has the upper hand in issues that are most important for 
the state, with the government implementing the day-to-day 
running of the country. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Stanislaw Kalina, director of the </F>
Szczecin Voivodship Office, by correspondent Pawel Winiarski; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Winiarski] It would appear that the reform of the 
administration system in our country has slowed down recently. 
On the other hand, the number of conflicts between local 
self-government structures and the central administration has 
increased. What is happening here? 
  [Kalina] When I was starting in my post of the Voivodship 
Office director, the process of decentralization of the existing 
range of powers and administrative competence was very rapid. 
Nowadays, these changes have, as it were, been suspended in a 
vacuum. For example, the pace of work on the pilot reform 
program has decelerated, as has that on the reform of the 
country's administrative division system. On the other hand, 
local self-government bodies had earlier secured a range of 
powers and competence of which they cannot now take full 
advantage because the necessary funds for the implementation of 
these powers have not followed in the wake of the legislation. 
In addition, the question of a clear and lucid division of 
competence between the central and local administration is also 
still unclear in many points. Consequently, it is not surprising 
that conflicts arise. 
  [Winiarski] Is Szczecin Voivodship particularly prone to 
frequent occurrences of such conflicts? Are they justified? 
  [Kalina] On the whole, as regards the quality of the central 
administration's work, we are among the national champions here, 
but the real criterion for assessing the work of the central 
administration bodies is provided by the results of conflicts 
brought before the Supreme Administrative Court [NSA]. In that 
area, we have no reason for indulging in complexes. For 
example, last year none of our supervisory administrative 
decisions against which charges were brought before the NSA by 
local self-government bodies were actually found questionable by 
that court. This does not necessarily mean that all of our 
other decisions were invariably correct. The NSA judged that 
several of our administrative decisions were incorrect. This 
was partly the result of the complexity of our legislation and 
partly the fault of individual officials handling the cases. 
However, the vast majority of complaints are caused by the poor 
knowledge of our legislation prevalent among the public and the 
lack of understanding of the role of central government 
officials. Another, partial reason is that certain 
organizations, particularly the trade unions, subscribe to the 
philosophy that, if the law is unfavorable to their causes, that 
is just too bad for the law. 
  [Winiarski] You mentioned mistakes made by central 
administration officials. How do these mistakes arise? 
  [Kalina] First of all, they arise out of the lack of 
thorough 
briefing in the disciplines of administrative law and modern 
administration systems. We still suffer from the lack of a 
cadre of well-trained experts, who would be apolitical, assured 
of their job security, protected from outside pressures, and 
given sufficient financial security in their positions. This is 
our greatest problem, and it can only be solved by a new 
parliamentary act on public service officials. At present, we 
have the opposite situation, with a growing number of instances 
of outside pressure to bring about certain administrative 
decisions, and with the financial situation of the public 
service officials worsening steadily. In this situation, it is 
hardly surprising that the best experts leave the sector and the 
most talented graduates of higher education establishments are 
reluctant to join our ranks. 
  [Winiarski] The list of complaints leveled against the 
central administration includes the extremely onerous and 
time-consuming procedure of appeals against the voivodas' 
decisions. It is true that cases brought before the NSA wait 
there for a very long time before being investigated. 
  [Kalina] It is indeed true. At present, the nearest 
extramural NSA center is situated in Poznan and serves five 
voivodships. Consequently, cases wait for six months or more 
before coming up for investigation. We want to change this 
state of affairs and set up an independent extramural NSA center 
in Szczecin. All the formal criteria for doing so have been 
met: We have a sufficient number of cases awaiting 
investigation, an adequate number of experienced and highly 
qualified judges, and enough academics who specialize in that 
branch of the law. We have also been successful in "breaking the 
premises barrier" in Szczecin. At present, the only dilemma we 
still have to face is the choice of the future seat of the 
Szczecin extramural NSA center from the two premises offered to 
us. Consequently, I believe that the first cases will be heard 
by the center as soon as the first quarter of next year. 
  [Winiarski] But does it guarantee that they will be 
investigated promptly? 
  [Kalina] Yes, and this should be advantageous not only to 
those bringing the charges, but also to the central 
administration bodies themselves, including such special 
administration centers as, say, customs and excise offices and 
the treasury police. Nothing improves the quality of work as 
effectively as the awareness of the existence of rapid 
monitoring systems capable of checking your results. In 
addition, the proposed bill postulating a revision of the NSA 
act contains provisions on the NSA control of local legislation 
brought in by local administration bodies. This will in effect 
mark an end to the accusation leveled against us that the law 
set down by the voivoda is not subject to any judicial controls. 
  [Winiarski] Have such accusations been brought against you? 
  [Kalina] Certain people view relations between central and 
local administration as a platform for power struggles and 
fights for domination. But we are doomed to work together, and 
we must find a way of coexisting. The voivoda does not aspire 
to the role of a scourge or sword suspended above the doings of 
local self-government structures. Our proposals and suggestions 
extended to city and parish councils before they make their 
decisions in specific cases prove that we wish to avoid the need 
to waive them after the fact. This type of cooperation has 
proved successful with many local self-government structures, 
but we simply cannot avoid a certain area of conflict, 
especially in the sphere of finance. Unfortunately, the 
situation is such that the voivoda is unable to finance many 
projects because he himself has no adequate funds at his 
disposal. The funds come from the central budget and are 
strictly limited. 
  [Winiarski] The voivoda also has the power to coordinate the 
activity of special administration structures. How are 
relations shaping along this line? 
  [Kalina] They vary. For the past few years, there has been a 
tendency to encourage massive development of the special 
administration structures and multiplying the numbers of 
relevant institutions. Each of them is under the competence of 
a different institution, and, as a consequence, the voivoda is 
unable to coordinate the work of that sector of local 
administration, although he is formally obliged to do so. As a 
result, the decisionmaking process becomes unduly extended, the 
bureaucratic apparatus mushrooms, and the entire system becomes 
more rigid instead of more flexible. This, of course, in turn 
causes frequent conflicts and misunderstandings. In 
consequence, all the blame is heaped on us because the voivoda 
is the most easily accessible representative of the central 
administration and the government. 
  [Winiarski] But perhaps the whole central administration is 
not really so very necessary? 
  [Kalina] There is no state in the world capable of 
functioning well without its own internal administration. 
However, the secret is in getting the whole administrative 
machinery to function efficiently and to issue just decisions on 
the basis of the legislation in force. In turn, that 
legislation must be clear and lucid and the range of competence 
clearly set out and distributed, and the people who are involved 
in operating that system must be adequately qualified and 
trained.

<F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Krajewski: "A Holding Company Beyond the </F>
Law; Agency Will Take Over 50 Trillion Zlotys Worth of State 
Wealth"] 
  [Text] The minister of foreign economic cooperation, 
who is a member of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], is trying to 
put together the biggest holding company in Poland. The company 
will take over the state's shares in Cenzin, Ciech, and 
Baltona. The ownership transformations minister, who comes from 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], thinks it is a scandal and 
amounts to using loopholes in the legal system. 
  The holding company in question is the state-owned Agency 
for 
Economic Development [Agencja Rozwoju Gospodarczego], which was 
set up by Minister Leslaw Podkanski on 2 February 1994. Over 
the next few years, the agency is to assume control over several 
dozen State Treasury partnerships that deal primarily with 
foreign trade and that are currently supervised by the foreign 
economic cooperation minister. 
<H5>  From Cenzin to Baltona </H5>
  The assets of these partnerships are evaluated at over 50 
trillion zlotys [Z], which would make the agency the largest 
capital/financial holding company in Poland. 
  Currently, its share capital is Z4.570 trillion and includes 
state-owned shares in three companies registered on the Warsaw 
Stock Exchange: 270,000 shares of the Bank Rozwoju Eksportu 
[BRE], 1.080 million shares of Electrim, and 2.628 million 
shares of Universal. 
  Over the few next years, the agency is to take over the 
state's shares in such big companies as Cenzin (62.7 percent), 
Ciech (51 percent), Baltona (51 percent), Animex (34 percent), 
Budimex (53 percent), Polimex Cekop (51 percent), Paged (30 
percent), Pol-Mot (24 percent), and Metronex, Poznan 
International Fairs (60 percent). So the agency will hold 
significant influence over the composition of the companies' 
governing boards. 
<H5>  NIK's Control </H5>
  According to Ownership Transformations Minister Wieslaw 
Kaczmarek, the establishment of the agency is a scandal: "Such 
institutions must be based on the legal system rather than 
taking advantage of loopholes in it," Kaczmarek told ZYCIE 
WARSZAWY. "As far as I know, the Supreme Chamber of Control 
[NIK] is examining the issue," he added. 
  "NIK has been examining the agency since May, within a 
program of controlling foreign trade centers," confirmed NIK 
Press Spokesman Wojciech Daniel. "Results will not be published 
until mid-July at the earliest." 
<H5>  Ambitious Plans </H5>
  According to the agency's statute, its goal, among others, 
is 
to provide financing for investment projects (construction of 
highways, border crossings, or inland waterways), promoting 
Polish exports, and providing guarantees or financial 
reinsurance for large economic ventures. 
  "Company `X' wants to bid on a modernization project for 
Beirut airport, which is estimated to cost $300 million. But 
first it has to put up collateral worth one-sixth of the 
contract. Our financial potential makes it possible for us to 
help the company in a such a situation," explains Wieslaw Kuc, 
chief of the agency and a former member of the BRE governing 
board. 
  What will happen if the agency finds itself in a situation 
of 
having to pay in place of a dishonest contractor? Shares and 
participation in State Treasury partnerships are one of the 
agency's assets. The agency does not want to sell them off, but 
it does not rule out doing that in case it gets into trouble by, 
for instance, having to repay a large credit that it had 
guaranteed earlier. Still, Chairman Kuc sounds confident that 
there will be no slipups because, in granting guarantees, he 
will be using the same kinds of procedures as those applied by 
banks.

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jun--Local government in cities has 
slipped out of control of the SLD-PSL [Democratic Left 
Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] ruling coalition. But, at the 
same time, no one has gained a decisive victory, Adam Michnik 
writes in GAZETA WYBORCZA, adding that almost nowhere will the 
individual parties be able to manage single-handed. 
  Three large blocs have formed in the cities: the SLD, the 
Freedom Union [UW], and right-wing coalitions. Who will enter 
into which setups with whom, the GAZETA WYBORCZA editor wonders, 
expressing the view that it depends only on the UW whether it 
can find the best partners in the other blocs because it is only 
the UW that is in the position to talk to both the SLD and the 
right-wing parties. 
  Specific issues and pragmatism and, consequently, rational 
programs and real abilities must outweigh ideological arguments, 
Michnik writes in his commentary on the results of the local 
government elections.

June, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social 
Democracy of the Polish Republic, said that, according to 
Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] estimates, the number of local 
councillors from that party increased tenfold after the 19 June 
local elections. There were 758 councillors during the previous 
term. The SLD won the largest number of seats (over 50 percent) 
in Wloclawek, Sosnowiec, and Czeladz. [passage omitted] 
  Szmajdzinski said that, in 29 towns where proportional 
elections took place, the SLD won 30 percent of the seats, which 
was comparable with the parliamentary election results. The SLD 
won 40-50 percent of seats in 10 cities, including Lodz, Zielona 
Gora, Bydgoszcz, Dabrowa Gornicza, Grudziadz, and Lublin.

<F P=106> [Article by wk: "Foreign Investors' Industrial-Commercial </F>
Chamber; `Strategy'--Yes, but..."] 
  [Text] Foreign investors are happy that the 
government announced an economic program covering several years. 
Still, they would like to get familiar with details of the 
program. 
  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak met with foreign investors 
yesterday. "We are united by a common goal--to score success in 
a market economy and in building democracy," said Pawlak. 
"Foreign investors who are members of the 
[industrial-commercial] chamber, as well as their Polish 
partners, support those political forces that guarantee the 
development of a market economy open to the world and based on 
private ownership," replied Chairman Stefan Lewandowski. 
  The businessmen had high praise for the government for 
having 
prepared the "Strategy for Poland," which creates the foundation 
for making business plans based on reliable data. Still, they 
asked the prime minister to provide more details. 
  Foreign investors asked the prime minister when the 
government will speed up the privatization process. "More 
companies may have been sold earlier, but, in general, these 
were sales for low prices. We are not eager to see privatization 
at any cost," Pawlak responded. 
  "What about taxes? Can we count on stability in the tax 
system?" the investors kept asking. "We are eager to see 
stability. There is the VAT [value-added tax], there are customs 
duties and income tax, and that should be enough," Pawlak 
explained.

  [Text] The Polish National Bank [NBP] was not

concerning issues related to reforms in the banking sector. 
There is talk that one of our departments was apparently

Gronkiewicz-Waltz told NOWA EUROPA. 
  In the Program, activities of the NBP were assessed quite 
critically. It was said that, while issuing money, supervising 
other banks, and performing ownership functions at the same 
time, the central bank does not perform any of these functions 
properly. According to Gronkiewicz-Waltz, there are no reasons 
to support such an argument. The central bank always forces the 
government to grant it concessions to decrease the budget 
deficit. We are the ones who make the reduction of the 
inflation rate happen. There is already some progress in the 
area, even though things could be better. As for supervision, 
the NBP knows what is happening among other banks, and it has 
compiled a detailed diagnosis on the topic. Still, if the state 
budget wants to take over banks being supervised by the NBP, I 
will gladly give them up, stated the chairwoman. 
  So, as to taking the NBP's suggestions into account, a 
provision on separating banking supervision out of the central 
bank's structure and on organizing the supervision in the form 
of an independent institution was removed from an initial 
version of the Strategy program. The independent institution 
form exists in only four EC countries. When it comes to Belgium 
and France, the independence of banking supervision is only 
apparent, while, for instance, in Finland, there is a trend to 
merge the functions. 
  The NBP chairwoman also expressed the view that, if one 
wants 
to establish several strong banks, one must consolidate them 
first and privatize them later. Once the banks go onto the stock 
market, any mergers will be practically impossible. Still, 
privatization is also needed because state-owned financial 
institutions are characterized by low efficiency dynamics. 
Their higher profitability, compared with the average value for 
the sector as a whole, is not a result of better management but 
is, instead, a result, for instance, of lower costs for 
obtaining money.

<F P=106> [Article by J.K.K.: "CUP on Economy From January to May; </F>
Increased Production, Lower Inflation"] 
  [Text] Over the first five months of this year, 
developmental trends prevailed in the economy, say experts for 
the Central Planning Administration [CUP]. 
  Compared with the first five months of last year, industrial 
output increased by 10.1 percent, including 11.5 percent over 
May, while, when it comes to the housing industry, output 
increased by 6.4 and 4.5 percent, respectively. 
  The financial situation of enterprises is better than a year 
ago. Gross revenue has been increasing at a faster rate than the 
cost of obtaining it, which in turn leads to high growth of the 
gross financial result (by 75.3 percent over four months of this 
year, compared with the same period last year). The total 
profit at the disposal of economic units [podmioty gospodarcze] 
has also been growing (by 13.1 trillion zlotys over the first 
four months of this year). Nominal monetary reserves of 
enterprises (zloty-denominated and in foreign currencies 
calculated in zlotys) were 5.6 percent higher in May than in 
December, whereas, a year ago, a drop of 2 percent was reported. 
  Despite the continuing negative foreign trade balance, the 
situation in exchange with foreign countries has definitely 
changed. Over the January-April period, the rate of growth of 
revenue from exports was 16.5 percent, compared with the same 
period last year, and it exceeded in a major way the growth rate 
of payments for imports (9.3 percent). A year ago, an 
over-10-percent drop in exports was reported in the same time 
period, with an over-18-percent increase in imports. 
  The state of field crops approximates or even exceeds the 
average level of recent years, and that is a sign of good crop 
yields in the future. Price configurations for producers of 
pigs and cattle have also been beneficial, which is a factor 
facilitating a reconstruction of the herds of these animals. 
  Among other positive trends being observed in the economy, 
CUP experts note the inflation rate, which is lower than last 
year. Over the January-May period, retail prices rose by 9.9 
percent, while, a year ago, they rose by as much as 14.5 
percent. Prices increased by 1.7 percent over the month of May. 
  However, these positive trends in the economy are 
accompanied 
by some negative phenomena. A high growth rate in salaries in 
enterprises operating within the old monopolist structures 
constitutes a particularly major danger for maintaining the 
growth trends. The burden on the state budget resulting from 
the effects of some earlier valorizations of retirement and 
other types of pensions, as well as pressure coming from the 
budget sector to have salary differences alleviated compared 
with the enterprise sector and a high level of debt among 
budget-sector units, could also have an impact on the inflation 
process. 
  As for foreign trade, decreasing trends in trade with 
countries of Central and East Europe and very minor expansion 
into markets in developing countries constitute a danger for 
maintaining the high export dynamism and for improving the 
foreign trade balance of payments. 
  A very significant and persistent drop (in the range of 24 
to 
26 percent) in the size of housing investments has been holding 
from the beginning of the year. After the first five months, 
the number of apartments delivered (22,200) is 35 percent lower 
than a year ago (the drop in the cooperative housing industry is 
47 percent). 
  Negative effects for economic growth also come from social 
tensions and strikes, which are a result of a lack of sense of 
social security and of frustrations present among many social 
groups, the CUP experts say.

<F P=106> [Article by U.K: "Textile Exporters Are Losing the Battle </F>
With the Competition: Quotas for the Taking"] 
  [Text] "The competitiveness of our textile products is 
falling. Cheaper products from the East Asia--and more and more 
frequently from Ukraine, Belarus, and the Balkan countries--are 
pushing our products out of the European Union (EU) markets," 
Waldemar Markuszewski, deputy director of the department of 
commodity sales and tariff policy regulation in the Ministry of 
Foreign Economic Cooperation, said to NOWA EUROPA. 
  Some types of textile products are included in the so-called 
sensitive commodities group. The EC countries, as well as the 
United States, Canada, and Norway, limit their export by 
employing quotas. 
  A large part of the quotas allocated to us in an interim 
agreement with EC remains unused. The ministry expects that this 
year will be better than last year. 
  The annual reduction in duties on Polish textiles should 
help 
to make this possible. Furthermore, the size of the quota itself 
is being increased 2-3 percent. 
  Our products are no longer as competitive as they were a 
year 
or two ago due to increased labor costs, although they are still 
lower than in the West. They lose out to the still-cheaper 
textiles from East Asia and the products from the Central and 
East European countries--e.g., Ukraine, Belarus, and Latvia. 
  Polish producers do not always know how to meet the 
requirements of the Western market, and they lack money for 
promotion. The old foreign trade organizations offices were 
either bankrupted or underwent transformation, and the companies 
were not always able to develop new connections with Western 
traders in time. The competition is great, and our firms find it 
difficult to meet it, especially because not every company can 
fill large orders. But there are Polish factories that have an 
established reputation on the foreign markets and steady 
customers in the EC countries and the United States. 
  Textile quotas to the United States, Canada, and Norway are 
also being only partially used. 
  Textiles are an important item in our trade and constitute 
almost 13.5 percent of total exports. Most of our exports are to 
Germany, indicating that our customers there know the Polish 
market well. This export makes up 18 percent of our export to 
the EU. We export the least to Spain and Portugal, whose markets 
are our competitors in deliveries to EC markets. 
  Only 18 groups of texile commodities are subject to quotas. 
We sell the remainder, such as blankets, woolen fabrics, tents, 
ladies' blouses, and work clothes, without limitations.

  [Text] At today's session in Mostar, the Chamber of 
Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna proposed Jadranko 
Prlic, president of the government of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, as a vice president and minister of defense in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federal Government. The chamber also 
discussed President Kresimir Zubak's report on the latest round 
of negotiations with the Serb side and government measures to 
curb lawlessness in the Herceg- Bosna area. Zdenko Vranjes 
reports: 
  [Vranjes] In addition to proposing Jadranko Prlic as a 
candidate for the post of vice president and minister of 
defense, the following were also put forward as candidates: 
Neven Tomic as minister of finance, Mate Tadic as minister of 
justice, Nikola Grabovac as minister of trade, and Stjepo Andric 
as minister without portfolio. Two candidates are contesting 
the post of minister for health care -- Vlado Simunovic and Ivan 
Sarec. The deputies also adopted a list of deputy ministers 
from the ranks of the Croat people in the federal government. 
  The constitutional amendments, including certain 
alterations, 
relating to the definition of mixed cantons were also adopted. 
A draft law on ministries and some other documents that will be 
placed on the agenda for a session of the federal parliament, 
scheduled to take place on Wednesday in Sarajevo, were also 
endorsed. 
  It seems that the big powers have agreed on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not relinquish the 
division of Bosnia at a 51-49 percent ratio, Kresimir Zubak, 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, said when 
presenting his report on the latest round of negotiations in 
Geneva. He also spoke in detail about the contact group's 
proposals; the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, gray zones, and 
blue roads. The Croatian side has been short-changed to some 
degree in the areas of Teslic and Kotor Varos, while Muslim 
interests have been fundamentally damaged in the area of eastern 
Bosnia. The Muslim territories around Kljuc and Sanski Most may 
be reduced as they will be designated as gray zones. 
  The Serbian side's demand for two power stations near Jajce 
to be given to the Serbs has not been accepted, Zubak added. 
Passages [pasaz] are now being mentioned instead of corridors, 
Zubak said, and added that this Serb passage in Posavina would 
run through Serb villages, so the whole of Derventa would be 
included in a Croat canton. Only some Croat villages between 
Brcko and Modrica would be included in the Serb passage. 
  The president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation said that 
a blue road between Modrica and Bosanski Samac, via Jajce, 
Kljuc, and Sanski Most had been discussed in Geneva as well as a 
corridor between Livno and Bihac. Of the three draft political 
solutions for Bosnia-Herzegovina the Croatian side regards the 
solution that implies a confederation between the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation with Croatia as the most 
acceptable, while at the same time the Serb part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina might have a similar arrangement with the 
so-called Yugoslavia. If the Serb side refuses the contact 
group's plan the federation will demand that the arms embargo be 
lifted, Zubak added. The deputies also issued an appeal to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and Fikret Abdic's forces to end their 
clashes in western Bosnia and to seek a solution at the 
negotiating table. The Croat side offers its services as a 
mediator in their negotiations. 
  Tonight the Chamber of Deputies also adopted the 
government's 
measures to curb crime in the Herceg-Bosna area. The government 
is duty-bound to submit to the deputies a report on the 
implementation of these measures within one month. The deputies 
demanded that in addition to measures to curb robberies along 
the road over Mount Vran Planina, steps should also be taken to 
either prove or dispell rumors circulating among people that the 
criminal operations in Herceg-Bosna are being covered up by 
elements within the top ranks of Herceg-Bosna's authorities or 
that they themselves are involved in these operations. Speaking 
about the onset of a fierce anticrime campaign, Kresimir Zubak 
told the deputies that the Presidential Council has set up a 
headquarters that will spearhead the fight against robberies and 
crime.

  Following a long debate and a break this afternoon, the 
chamber of deputies is expected to adopt a list of Croatian 
Democratic Union candidates for members of the federal 
government. Jadranko Prlic has been put forward as a vice 
president performing the duty of minister of defense in the 
federal government.

  [Text] Abdic's forces have continued to use long-range 
artillery from well inside the occupied territory of Velika 
Kladusa, with continuing support by the chetniks from the 
so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. The intensity 
of the shelling with tanks, howitzers, and mortars is best 
illustrated by the fact that over the last two days from [words 
indistinct] they have fired over 6,000 shells, razing [word 
indistinct] villages to the ground. There have been many 
casualties. 
  Since midday, the members of the Kladusa paramilitary have 
intensified their attacks along the entire front line, and 
reliable reports claim that Abdic's (?fascist) headquarters is 
preparing a new offensive and new attacks to recapture lost 
ground. However, he still has problems with forceful 
mobilization, and with generally mobilization, since the 
population is simply rejecting all calls. It is important to 
stress that the population's cooperation is [word indistinct] 
every day.

  [Text] Petrovac, June (TANJUG)--Heavy fighting between 
forces loyal to Bosnia's Moslem fundamentalist leader Alija 
Izetbegovic and those of the Autonomous Province of Western 
Bosnia (APZB) continued Monday in the Moslem enclave of Cazin 
Krajina in Western Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The radio station in Velika Kladusa, the APZB centre, said 
Izetbegovic's forces had attempted to infiltrate a terrorist 
group and had opened artillery and small arms fire on APZB 
troops. 
  Bihac radio, controlled by Izetbegovic's forces, said the 
forces of the Sarajevo Moslem government firmly controlled all 
their positions despite continuing attacks by the APZB army. 
  APZB leader Fikret Abdic is opposed to Izetbegovic's policy 
of war and wants Moslems, Serbs and Croats to live peacefully 
side by side. Immediately after the proclamation of the APZB in 
autumn last year, Izetbegovic's troops attacked the forces and 
population of the new autonomy. The conflicts, which have so 
far claimed hundreds of lives, did not stop after the latest 
Bosnia ceasefire came into effect on June 10.

  [Excerpts] Velika Kladusa, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 20 
(AFP) -- With Bosnia's Moslem-led army closing in, authorities 
in the breakaway Moslem enclave of Bihac have detained up to 700 
civilians for opposing the war effort, including women, 
teenagers and elderly people, relief officials and other sources 
say. 
  Many of the male detainees were taken away for refusing to 
join the vastly outnumbered force defending Bihac against a 
battle-hardened corps of the Bosnian army advancing from the 
south of the pocket toward Velika Kladusa, its main town, 
relatives and members of international relief organizations say. 
No firm figure on the number of detainees is available, 
although a variety of independent sources put it at between 400 
and 700. 
  The speaker of Bihac's self-proclaimed parliament, Bozidar 
Sicel, admitted that 150 people have been arrested. He 
dismissed them as "spies or agents spreading disinformation" in 
the intra-Moslem conflict and said searches of their homes had 
turned up weapons and explosives. 
  The arrests began on June 10, the day the Bosnian army 
launched an offensive against Bihac, in the northwest corner of 
the republic, relief officials say. The detainees are being 
held at a poultry farm converted into a detention camp near the 
border with Croatia. 
  A member of the International Committee of the Red Cross 
gained access to the camp over the weekend after a week of 
pressuring authorities for access. "They are men who refused to 
serve in the military, and political dissidents, but what is 
worse, their relatives have also been arrested, including women, 
adolescents and elderly people," a relief official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said. [passage omitted] 
  Here in Velika Kladusa, small groups of women gather each 
day 
outside the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees or 
the Red Cross to ask the organizations to intervene on behalf of 
their missing loved ones. 
  "They took away several dozen, in two cars and a truck," the 
wife of one detainee said on condition she not be named. "My 
husband didn't want to fight against fellow Moslems, and 
everybody knew it. They took away 15 of our neighbors, including 
a 70-year-old." 
  Another woman said she challenged the officials who came and 
took away her husband, an engineer, last Monday [13 June]. "I 
asked them for an official document. They showed me one that 
said they had the right to search homes. Then they took away my 
husband." She added: "One of his friends agreed to go to the 
warfront. They let him go, and the next day he was on a bus for 
the front line. As for me, they said they would arrest me if I 
went back" to the UN refugee agency. 
  Rumors are circulating around town that the prisoners are 
being mistreated and deprived of food. Relatives also say some 
are being forced to dig trenches on the front lines. Over the 
weekend a group of civilians digging with shovels and picks were 
seen on the front line near the hamlet of Hasici, with soldiers 
watching over them. But there was no way to confirm they were 
prisoners.

  [Text] Regarding the Brcko front, the latest cease-fire

  Early in the evening, our fighters resisted several attacks 
by Chetnik surveillance-saboteur groups in the central part of 
the front. Along with intensified provocations [word

<F P=106> [Report by A. Pecanac: "Against the Originators of the </F>
Conflict"] 
  [Text] The first convention of the Republican Party was 
held in the crowded Congress Hall of the Holiday Inn Hotel in 
Sarajevo. Explaining the main program aims of the newly-founded, 
civilian-oriented party, its founder Stjepan Kljuic remarked 
that the Republican Party would soon join all the patriotic 
forces in Bosnia- Herzegovina in mobilization and the 
preparations for the final liberation of the homeland. The 
engagement of the Republican Party should be viewed in this 
context; the party does not intend to oppose the current 
authorities, but it will oppose all those who are against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and cooperate with all those who support 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We hope that the West will go back to international law and 
that it will not allow Europe to be Balkanized and the ethnic 
occupation rewarded, said Kljuic. The conflict with the Croats, 
which was a mistake in Croatian policies toward 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, is also to blame for the tragic fate of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, according to Kljuic, the Republicans 
will strongly oppose the attempts to appoint some of the people 
who participated in the politics that led to the conflict and 
the victims of war in the new federal authorities. 
  The Republican Party sees the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
in 
being oriented toward the West and its fundamental democratic 
values, as well as toward the Islamic countries. 
  Remarking that the establishment of an independent, 
sovereign, and integral Bosnia-Herzegovina is the basis of the 
future activities of the party, Kljuic said that it is in such 
Bosnia- Herzegovina that the Republican Party will support the 
establishment of the economic system on the basis of private 
ownership, market economy, ethnic and religious freedom, civil 
freedom, human rights, independent judiciary, and all other 
democratic achievements contained in the UN Charter. Moreover, 
Kljuic said that the party would become involved in actualizing 
the return of the refugees and displaced persons in the country, 
without which there will be no peace on these territories. 
  Welcoming the founding of another party in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mirsad Ceman, head secretary of the SDA 
[Party of Democratic Action] remarked that the success of the 
founding of this party would depend on the extent to which the 
ideas represented by the Republican Party will extend beyond the 
borders that are at present controlled by the Army of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Support for the forming of the Republican Party was 
expressed 
by Mirsad Ceman on behalf of the SDA, Nijaz Durakovic, president 
of the Social Democratic Party, Salih Foco of the LBO [expansion 
unknown], Ilija Simic on behalf of the HSS [Croatian Peasants' 
Party], Sejfudin Tokic of the Union of Social Democrats of 
Bosnia- Herzegovina, and Dragutin Cicak, president of the Croat 
Civil Party. 
  Stjepan Kljuic was elected president of the Republican 
Party, 
and the members of the Directorate are: Dr. Adnan Dizdar, Dr. 
Boris Tihi, Zaim Zeljkovic, Dr. Slobodan Trninic, and Senka 
Nozica. 
  In the following six months, the Republican Party will be 
working on bringing the organization to life, and soon they will 
promote their program in all the major towns in the Republic.

  [Text] The main activity of the Federal Government over the 
past week concentrated on the realization of the program of 
economic stabilization, the Federal Government stated at a 
regular news conference. Sporadic cases of currency dealers' 
cuts are of a passing character and the exchange rate of dinar 
remains stable, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic assesses. Vladimir 
Nikolic reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Nikolic] From 24 January to 11 June, 
prices have increased by a mere 0.8 percent altogether. 
However, the structure of increases is not satisfactory because 
we have noted a (?great) increase in the prices of agricultural 
produce and the prices of services, Kontic said. For this 
reason, the Federal Government has pointed to further 
possibilities to cut prices, especially some of them. The main 
attention focused on the accomplished level of incomes and its 
influence on the realization of the program, the strengthening 
of the overall economic activity and production, and elimination 
of the budget deficit in the second half-year. In connection 
with this, at yesterday's session, the Federal Government passed 
a decree that regulates the salaries of deputy prime ministers, 
federal ministers, and officials, changes to the law on 
earnings, compensations, and other incomes of the employees in 
the federal ministries, federal offices, federal organizations, 
and federal government services, and changes to the decree on 
expenses that are being recognized as material expenses for the 
federal administration offices. 
  According to Kontic, salaries have increased greatly, 
especially in May. He assessed this as a negative trend, 
primarily because of its intensity, which does not match the 
increase in production and the trends in the economy. An 
accompanying factor is a disproportion between the incomes in 
industry and non-industry. However, the federal prime minister 
believes that the total income mass in May means that we have 
accomplished equilibrium with the available national product. He 
said that further increases in salaries could endanger the 
strategic goals of the program of the economic stabilization: 
  [Kontic] Departing from these conclusions, the Federal 
Government, with the decrees that I have just read, passed a 
decision to reduce all calculation factors at the federal level, 
better to say, in the federal administration, by 30 percent and 
to additionally reduce the highest salaries in the Federal 
Government by an additional 10 to 15 percent. To avoid any 
misunderstandings in your reports and interpretations of my 
words, I must draw your attention to the fact that the Federal 
Government has, even so far, been paying out approximately 30 
percent lower salaries in comparison to the established 
calculation factors. Therefore, nobody should conclude that the 
earnings in the federal administration will be reduced by this 
amount. 
  [Nikolic] The Federal Government is preparing a law that 
will, in a unique way, regulate all the issues regarding the 
entire state administration. Regarding general economic 
activity and the increase in production, they concluded that 
positive trends are taking place. Statistically speaking, the 
industrial production in May was lower than the month before, 
however, according to the federal prime minister, positive 
trends have continued in industry. The energy supply, which has 
noted an expected drop, has a considerable share in all this. 
This primarily refers to electrical energy, whose production is 
matched with the requirements. Excluding the energy industry, 
the remainder of industry is nevertheless [words indistinct] 
than in April, Kontic said. 
  We expect further cuts in the share with which the public 
expenditure participates in the national product, which has 
already been brought below 41 percent. Kontic assessed that the 
budget deficit will also be eliminated by increasing incomes 
from real sources. 
  [Kontic] Departing from this, we have drawn up and already 
agreed a consolidated balance of public expenditure at the level 
of the country, which involves a certain amount of deficit 
financing of the budget in July only, however even then 
exclusively on the basis of foreign currency coverage. The 
uncovered balance of the federal budget has been reduced to 100 
million dinars altogether, while the republics have practically 
managed to eliminate their budget deficits. 
  [Nikolic] Prime Minister Kontic informed the reporters that 
at yesterday's session the Federal Government passed a proposal 
on the law banning the construction of nuclear power plants on 
FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] territory. With this, the 
existing legal provision has been harmonized with the FRY 
Constitution. The law envisages a ban on the construction of 
nuclear power plants and a ban on the construction of 
installations for manufacture of nuclear fuel and processing of 
exhausted nuclear fuel on FRY territory. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article in two installments by D. Vukovic and S.P. </F>
Stamatovic: "Who Are the New Ambassadors?"] 
<H5>  [14 Jun p 12] </H5>
  [Text] Yugoslav diplomacy is preparing an offensive. This 
can be deduced from the fact that, several days ago, a new 
diplomatic corps, composed of new heads of the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] missions in a number of foreign 
capitals, was inaugurated. 
  When the Federal Government announced this 20 days ago, in a 
statement issued in the wake of the meeting, it also pointed out 
that the new Yugoslav diplomatic corps would also include many 
businessmen, because economic affairs are unquestionably of 
primary importance. The weekend before last, while introducing 
the list of new ambassadors to the public, Federal Prime 
Minister Kontic made a few critical remarks on the behavior of 
the press, which, he sais, had speculated a lot about the list 
and spread the conviction that mainly businessmen would be 
chosen for diplomatic posts. Whether the prime minister had 
actually overlooked the statement previously made by the Federal 
Government, or whether he wanted to say something else when the 
names had already been specified is not quite clear. 
  Anyway, the list was presented to the public, together with 
the request of the representatives of the government to 
journalists that they should not call it the list of 
ambassadors. The reason is that ambassadors cannot be appointed 
as long as the sanctions last, so the press should rather refer 
to the designated people for the posts of heads of missions, or 
charge d'affairs, and suchlike. That is to say, the list 
includes people who are professional diplomats, for whom 
diplomacy is both a vocation and a profession, as well as those 
who are coming from the public, political, and, in a broader 
sense, social life. 
<H5>  Ministers and Writers </H5>
  In this second group, the man with the best social rating in 
the current circumstances is certainly Danilo Z. Markovic, 61. 
He should not need any particular introduction to the public, 
because he earned his good reputation as the minister of 
education in all governments under Milosevic so far. He is 
believed to have been the mentor of Mirjana Markovic 
[Milosevic's wife] when she was working on her graduation exam, 
after which he became her protegee. He belonged to [Mirjana] 
Markovic's ideological group at Belgrade University that, 
actually, prepared the Eighth Session [of the Serbian 
communists, which launched Milosevic to power], only to make 
headway in his political career after that. The scientific 
career of Markovic rests upon a breakthrough to the East. His 
book, Sociological Aspects of Work--which is his 
expert field of knowledge--was translated only in Moscow and 
Sofia, under the communist regimes. Is this what makes him 
qualified to take up the Moscow office? It is quite unlikely 
that he still has admirers in the Moscow offices from which the 
state is run. Or, could it be, perhaps, that they are just 
temporarily absent? 
  Djoko Stojicic, 58, also has a ministerial pedigree. He is 
leaving for Prague to replace Stanja Stojanovic, who was 
Milosevic's right hand man when he was squaring accounts with 
rivals from the Yugoslav Communist Parties in the former Central 
Committee of the Association of Communists of Yugoslavia 
[CKSKY]. Stojanovic spent four lovely and well-deserved years 
in Prague, where he was so successful that the president of the 
state in which he served raised a hue and cry against the Serbs. 
Whether he, as an ambassador, could do anything about it is 
questionable, but what we have stated here is definitely 
unquestionable. 
  In any case, Stojicic is going to face the same from 
President Vaclav Havel who is ill-disposed toward the Serbs. 
Just like Havel, Stojicic is also an author, but his literary 
status is quite unclear, even in Yugoslavia, let alone abroad. 
His poetry is not so esteemed, yet he is writing and publishing 
it persistently. Recently, however, in a review of one of his 
volumes of contemporary folk poems, which Stojicic collected and 
brought to light, academician P. Ivic assessed his opus as being 
equal to the work of Vuk Karadzic [famous 18th century Serbian 
philologist and linguist]. 
  In terms of politics, Stojicic is also Milosevic's 
confidant. 
Before the Eighth Session, he was in a brief dilemma over 
whether to stay neutral in the conflict, but shortly thereafter 
he made a decision and joined the right side. Thereafter he 
edited NIN, managed the Institute for International Scientific 
and Cultural Cooperation, and, until recently, he was a minister 
in [Serbian prime minister] Nikola Sainovic's cabinet. As a 
young man, he was a leader of the Youth Association for a long 
time and was also an internationalist for quite long thereafter. 
Eventually, he gradually began to lean toward the national 
line. He is quite good at picking lucrative jobs -- for many 
years he was the chairman of Krsmanac [choir and ensemble 
performing folk songs and dances], which it made possible for 
him to travel all over the world. Yet, we have to give him 
credit for initiating a rather respectable festival -- the 
Mokranjac [famous Serbian composer] Festival traditionally held 
in Negotin. 
  Many people believe that Veizovic remained in the office of 
Krajina's foreign minister for such a (relatively) short time, 
because the assessment of the then Krajina leadership was that 
he is too soft a Serb. On the eve of one of many negotiating 
conferences on the Krajina issue (the London conference), 
Zecevic decided to replace Veizovic with Slobodan Jarcevic, 
because the prime minister believed that a Krajina native ought 
to be the leading man of Krajina's diplomatic corps. 
  It seems that Veizovic was also rated as a soft Serb because 
of his platform for negotiations in settling the Krajina issue. 
According to some opinions, his platform, which found support in 
Vukovar at the time, promoted the confederal option for Croatia 
and the RSK, although Veizovic himself says: "My platform meant 
that one can find a solution only through negotiations, while, 
actually, all the options were being reconsidered at the time as 
well as any solution based on the Vance plan and equal rights 
for all the peoples in the former Yugoslavia." 
  Veizovic, whose current title is "authorized minister of the 
Federal Foreign Ministry," is now working in the SMIP, or in 
other words, he is a diplomat in transfer at the moment. 

<H5>    [15 Jun p 12] </H5>

<H5>    Diplomats and Double-Ministers </H5>
  Among the 11 heads of Yugoslav diplomatic missions who have 
been recently appointed, five of them are from Montenegro. Two 
of them, Miodrag Lekic and Zoran Popovic, have already been 
Yugoslav ambassadors abroad. Dr. David Dasic has also been to a 
diplomatic mission, but as consul general to New York City. 
Gojko Dapcevic has been with the Federal Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs [SMIP] for several years, but was never sent abroad 
before. We do not know whether the same applies to Ljubo 
Djukic, longtime SMIP official. The post of the Yugoslav charge 
d'affairs (to the Austrian capital) has been given to Dobrosav 
Veizovic, longtime deputy of the Serbian foreign minister and 
short-time foreign minister in the government of the Republic of 
Serbian Krajina. 
  Gojko Dapcevic, 56, newly appointed ambassador of the FRY to 
Kiev, is a famous poet of the mid-generation. He entered the 
SSIP [former Federal Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, now SMIP] 
several years ago, changing from the post of the director of the 
Marxist Center to the Central Committee of the Association of 
Communists of Montenegro. Those who know him well say that 
Dapcevic had an eye out for a diplomatic post for the past 20 
years, and only now has he got one. He graduated from the 
Faculty of Philosophy in Belgrade. 
  Dr. David Dasic, 54, is the future chief of the Yugoslav 
diplomatic mission to Brazil. He is an economist by profession. 
After studying in Belgrade, Dasic remained in the capital for 
some time to do some scientific work. The leadership of the 
Association of Communists of Montenegro [SKCG] offered him a job 
at the time when the chairman of the Central Committee of SKCG 
was Vojo Srzentic, so Dasic took up the position of executive 
secretary of the Central Committee. After that, he worked in 
the [former] Federal Executive Council as an adviser, then he 
changed over to the SSIP, only to be thereafter appointed 
Yugoslav consul general to New York City. 
  The future Yugoslav ambassador to Syria, Zoran Popovic, 45, 
started his career as journalist in TANJUG. From Cyprus, where 
he was TANJUG correspondent, he came to Montenegro as 
reinforcement for the then Radio Titograd. He was editor in 
chief of Radio Titograd for four years, after which he atayed an 
additional four years in the capital of Montenegro as the editor 
of the only Montenegrin daily, POBJEDA. Even then, people were 
saying that Popovic was not particularly interested in 
journalism, but rather considered it as a temporary occupation 
on his way to a diplomatic post. So it was -- Popovic went as 
Yugoslav ambassador to Jordan. His affinity for Arabic 
countries is logical, since he has a degree in Oriental studies. 
  Ljubo Djukic, longtime SMIP official, who is now leaving to 
take up the ambassador post in North Korea, is not so well-known 
in Podgorica, since he did not perform any political function in 
Montenegro. This is understandable, because while he was aide 
and senior at the ministry [not further specified] in Belgrade 
he was mainly in charge of relations with the Assembly and the 
government. 
  According to BORBA's sources, all the future ambassadors on 
the Montenegrin list meet one of very important preconditions 
for working in the diplomatic service -- they speak at least one 
foreign language fluently. Except for Lekic, whom we reliably 
know that he does not belong to any political party, we could 
not find out if the other four do. 
  According to well-informed sources, the future Yugoslav 
charge d'affairs to Austria, Dobrosav Veizovic, 58, is a 
professional diplomat with appropriate experience, or as he 
himself says, he is a career diplomat. Veizovic is a Serb from 
Serbia (he was born in Bajina Basta), rather than one from 
Krajina, as he was believed to be earlier because he was the 
foreign minister in the government of the Republic of Serbian 
Krajina [RSK] for several months. He graduated from the Faculty 
of Philosophy (German literature and the Italian language), he 
speaks German and Italian, and has some knowledge of 
Scandinavian languages. 
  Veizovic acquired his diplomatic experience in the Yugoslav 
Embassies in Stockholm, Copenhagen, and Cyprus, where he was the 
chief adviser, and he was also the secretary of the Yugoslav 
Embassy in Bern. Since 1964, he has been with the SMIP. What 
made people remember Veizovic, however, is the two ministerial 
offices that he held at the same time for several months. From 
1991 to 1993, he was the deputy Serbian foreign minister in 
Vladislav Jovanovic's cabinet (who was also a double minister 
for a while, republican and federal), while in the course of 
1992 he also happened to be the foreign minister of the RSK in 
Zdravko Zecevic's cabinet. 

<H5>    A Man of Weight </H5>
  Darko Tanaskovic, 48, the future head of the mission to 
Turkey, is not only not a professional diplomat, but he also has 
no political background, as his predecessor does. However, his 
weight in the eyes of the public is perhaps the greatest among 
all the newly appointed ambassadors. He taught Islamic studies 
at Belgrade University for a long time and earned undisputable 
respect among his colleagues. The son of a general (his father 
was the commander of the Territorial Defense of Serbia), even as 
a student Tanaskovic became quite famous for his high marks and 
knowledge. However, recently, he became involved in social 
debates in which his attitude, generally well-balanced, assumed 
a somewhat stronger national color. Possibly, this might be a 
good enough recommendation for the authorities in Serbia to put 
him on the list, although it is not the best reference for the 
country he has been assigned to. In some of his more recent 
performances, he has not been considerate toward the Muslim 
cause at all. Some say that this attitude of his was aimed at 
gaining entry to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. 
Instead of the Academy, Tanaskovic has entered diplomacy. 
  Among the freshmen in the diplomatic service, there is also 
Dragoslav Jovanovic, 57, until recently deputy prime minister in 
Sainovic's cabinet, who has been appointed head of the mission 
to Brussels. Jovanovic built his career in the SDK [State 
Taxation Service], where he was director general. At a certain 
stage, rumors circulated that he would be appointed governor of 
the National Bank of Yugoslavia, until the real messiah 
appeared; namely Dragoslav Avramovic. 
  Jovanovic was born in "Serbian Kumrovec" [town in Croatia 
where Tito was born], that is Pozarevac, where he most probably 
had an opportunity to see and meet the man who makes the 
decisions on diplomatic careers. In his youth, Jovanovic was 
active in athletics, he was a sprinter, while later he became an 
official of the Athletic Association of Serbia. 
  Zivorad Igic, 52, the future head of the mission to Tirana, 
was born in Babin Most, near Pristina. He graduated from the 
Faculty of Philosophy. He was a journalist, and editor in chief 
of the informative-political program of Radio Pristina, 
responsible editor of KOMUNIST, the Kosovo edition, and also the 
editor in chief of Pristina's daily JEDINSTVO. 
  Since 1981, he has been writing for many Yugoslav 
newspapers. 
He wrote several studies, as well as two books. In 1988, Igic 
was appointed deputy chairman of the Association of Journalists 
of Yugoslavia, while his first political function was that of a 
member of the Council of the Regional Committee of Association 
of Communists [OKSK] of Pristina in 1989. A month later he was 
designated a member of the Presidency of the Provincial 
Committee of the Association of Communists [PKSK] of Kosovo, 
while in December of the same year he was elected chairman of 
the Socialist Association of Kosovo. 
  At the inaugural congress of the Socialist Party of Serbia 
[SPS] in July 1990, he was elected a member of the Executive 
Committee of the Main Board of the SPS, while three months later 
he was elected deputy chairman of the Regional SPS Board for 
Kosovo. In December 1990, he was appointed a delegate to the 
Serbian Assembly, while in fall 1992 he rose to the function of 
chairman of the Regional SPS Board for Kosovo. In the same 
year, he was appointed a delegate to the Council of Citizens at 
the Yugoslav Assembly, where he clashed with the radicals. 
  Until 1988, Igic had little social recognition, while, since 
then, he has been decorated and awarded several times. Among 
other recognitions, he was awarded the Medal of Work with Silver 
Wreath, the Svetozar Markovic award, the Award of the Yugoslav 
Institute for Journalism, and so forth. 
<H5>  Trained in Montenegro </H5>
  As for the "Montenegrin list," the greatest attention is 
being paid to Miroslav Lekic, 47, the current foreign minister 
of Montenegro and future Yugoslav ambassador to Rome. After he 
finished studying political science in Belgrade, Lekic started 
his career in his home town of Bar, where he performed many 
different functions -- he was the secretary of the OKSK of Bar, 
the director of the local cultural center, and the director of 
Radio Bar. He made a name for himself as a member of the 
Executive Council of Montenegro, where he was the secretary of 
the Committee for Education and Culture at the time when the now 
deceased Vuko Vukadinovic was chairman of the Executive Council. 
It was the Executive Council that, after the well-known events 
in October 1988, collectively resigned. That was the first 
success of the antibureaucratic revolution in Montenegro. Lekic 
is one of few people from Vukadinovic's team who, after the 
"Montenegrin January," remained in the newly elected Executive 
Council, with Radoje Kontic as its chairman. After that Lekic 
went to the diplomatic service. He was the Yugoslav ambassador 
to Mozambique, at the same time being in charge of diplomatic 
relations with Lesotho. Lekic is a well- mannered diplomat who 
speaks several foreign languages fluently. Few people know that 
he is not a member of the ruling Democratic Party of Socialists, 
although in the second cabinet of [Prime Minister] Mile 
Djukanovic he was given a very important ministerial department.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Milika Sundic from the "Sunday at Ten" </F>
program] 
  [Text] The current situation on the territory of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is actually neither that of war nor peace. 
The Muslim-Croat coalition is obviously not adhering to the 
one-month cease-fire agreement that had been reached with many 
difficulties. There is also a serious danger of what will happen 
in the days ahead. It is also uncertain as to whether the 
one-month cease-fire will ensure further negotiations on the 
settlement of the crisis on the territory of the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Therefore, the most important thing is to preserve peace at 
any cost. The second most important thing is to invest 
additional efforts so that the negotiations on the final 
solution to the crisis can continue. 
  The most important thing is what the contact group is going 
to do with the maps, because it is obvious that the latest 
meeting in London has not resulted in an accord among the 
countries that are participating in the meeting. There is even 
a mention of major differences in the views of West Europe and 
the United States, while not much is known as to what Vitaliy 
Churkin was promoting at these talks in the contact group. 
  If one is to judge this according the results of Radovan 
Karadzic's visit to Moscow, and what [Russian Foreign] Minister 
Kozyrev said after that visit, one could expect the Russians 
this time to insist that some vital interests of the Srpska 
republic be satisfied. This vital interest does not only amount 
to percentages, that is, to the 49 percent, but to the integrity 
of the Serbian territory in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Without that territorial integrity, the Srpska republic could 
obviously not accept any agreement, even if this were to the 
detriment of an agreement for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  At this moment all the factors that protect and defend the 
interests of the Srpska republic and the interests of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must be extremely careful not to 
find themselves in the situation that could be abused against 
the Srpska republic -- here I, of course, also refer to the 
republic of Serbian Krajina -- as well as the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. 
  At this moment it would not be prudent to discuss anything 
else but focus on the soonest possible establishment of a 
lasting and just peace. The Srpska republic has obviously been, 
is, and will be prepared to accept any just peace. On its part, 
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is ready to accept any 
agreement that would satisfy the interests of all three sides in 
the conflict. 
  However, one should be wary of those forces in the world who 
obviously do not care for a lasting and stable peace on the 
territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. I primarily refer to 
some West European quarters and the United States, and 
especially to the Republic of Croatia. A just settlement of the 
crisis in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is obviously not in its 
interest as it expects that further complications in the crisis 
there would help Croatia to achieve some of its aims vis-a-vis 
the republic of Serbian Krajina. 
  I do not know whether the international community is 
sufficiently ready and able to realize the essence of the 
current crisis, but one thing is clear: If the United States 
and the European Union cared for a lasting and stable peace, 
that peace could be established as early as tomorrow. They must 
exert additional pressure on the Muslim-Croat coalition to 
accept peace. Contentious issues can be discussed and negotiated 
until a lasting and stable solution has been found. 
  Therefore, the situation is extremely uncertain. The 
greatest danger comes from the uncertainly of what the maps will 
look like. This time I believe Russia will finally realize all 
the behind-the-scenes activities of the United States, Germany, 
and some other member countries of the European Union aimed at 
granting the Muslim-Croat coalition something that does not 
belong to them, to the detriment of the Srpska republic and thus 
to the detriment of the Serbian people and the Serbian lands as 
a whole.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 20 (TANJUG) -- Serbia's riverboat 
shipyards are operating at barely one-fifth capacity because of 
the two-year-old economic sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
According to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, work at 10 
shipyards in Serbia has ceased, resulting in lost revenues of 
about 150 million German marks. The chamber said Monday that the 
6,000 employees in the shipbuilding sector could build about 300 
million German marks worth of ships a year, providing work for 
another 150,000 workers in industries ranging from the iron and 
steel to electrical sectors. The chamber group dealing with 
shipbuilding has announced plans for constructing a new river 
fleet over the next several years. The government will put up 40 
percent of the funds, with rest coming from shipyards, customers 
and banks. 
  Before the imposition of the UN sanctions, Yugoslav 
shipyards 
spent about 80 percent of their time on production for export, 
with many Yugoslavs working overseas on such ships. The chamber 
group said that today, most Yugoslav ships that had been based 
abroad are moored in dock, where they are steadily decaying and 
have lost their navigation permits. According to the 
Jugoregistra register of shipping, only 360 of a total of 906 
Yugoslav vessels still hold valid permits. Serbia previously 
had one of the largest fleets on the Danube.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F>
Kosova, by reporter Bujar Muharremi in the Albanian Television 
studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Muharremi] Dear viewers; I greet you from the 
studio of the satellite program and invite you to view a 
conversation with president of the republic of Kosova Dr. 
Ibrahim Rugova, who is our guest tonight. 
  Mr. Chairman, it has been several months since our last 
conversation and I think there have been many problems that have 
given rise to this conversation, considering also the fact that 
you are continuing contacts at the highest level in Europe 
regarding the Kosova issue. 
  I would like to greet our television viewers wherever they 
may be, in Albania, Kosova, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Germany, Sweden, Denmark, 
Norway, and in all other countries where they are temporarily 
working and living. 
  I would like to inform you, dear viewers, that in our 
conversation with Chairman Rugova, you will have the possibility 
to call us directly on numbers 426-08 and 425-01. 
  Mr. Chairman, I greet you and thank you for taking part in 
our satellite program. 
  [Rugova] Allow me to thank you for this invitation to talk 
again. As you noted, there have been many problems and there 
still are. However, we should maintain our work consistently, 
consider the situation first in Kosova and then in Albanian 
areas and, of course, establish contacts with the world, our 
friends, and foster contacts and sympathy. This is our 
every-day job and we should do it. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, I believe we can start our 
conversation today with your recent visit, your last diplomatic 
tour to several European countries. As we reported on our 
satellite program, you recently paid an official visit to 
Denmark, then stopped over in Norway, and then went again to 
Germany. Your last stop was in France. Of course, Mr. 
President, it is observed that your contacts reach top official 
spheres. For example, in Denmark you met Prime Minister 
Rasmussen and Foreign Minister Petersen. Are these meetings a 
sign of the seriousness of the Kosova issue and the increasing 
interest of European diplomacy? 
  [Rugova] I can say that it was really a cycle of visits or a 
small tour in several European countries starting, as you 
stressed, from Denmark. What was most important was the visit 
to the North Atlantic Assembly, to which we were invited. The 
talks we held there and our presentations were very successful 
and important. I can say that the entire visit in general was 
very successful and very productive. At the same time, I do 
agree with you, because this illustrates the seriousness of the 
issue and raises the Kosova issue to the level of the official 
and state diplomatic circles of the European countries. I can 
say that we received not only understanding, but also support 
from these countries. These countries are very important not 
only in the European Union, but also in the Atlantic Pact. 
  After these official contacts, I can say that, fortunately, 
we have made many friends who, during these years, have visited 
and helped Kosova -- friends who have been to Albania and have 
helped Albania. I want to say that we have maintained contact 
with them, as a popular saying goes: It is easy to make friends, 
but it is difficult to keep them. We should keep these friends 
and establish regular contacts in the future. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, could you describe some of the 
main issues you raised during your last European tour? 
  [Rugova] We discussed the situation in Kosova, which is 
always dangerous and tense. It is a situation of repression, 
violence, and discrimination, or apartheid, as is said in Europe 
nowadays. Secondly, we discussed the question of our political 
plans -- the plan for Kosova, for the political solution of the 
Kosova question. As you know, our political plan is for an 
independent and neutral Kosova, open to Serbia and Albania. As 
a preventive measure, we have requested a larger international 
presence and protection for Kosova, as well as a protectorate or 
civil administration as a transitional or temporary stage for 
Kosova, in which life would be normalized and institutions would 
function. We could then talk about the status and future of 
Kosova. I hope that one day the Serbs will change their 
viewpoints. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. Chairman, in an interview for Deutsche 
Welle during your stay in Germany, you stressed that you favor 
the option of the independence of Kosova. You also stressed that 
an international civil protectorate would be a transitional 
stage. How were these alternatives you presented received by 
your main interlocutors? 
  [Rugova] I can say that there is understanding for the plan 
and the viewpoint on the independence of Kosova, because this is 
a result of the referendum we held in 1991, just like the other 
peoples in the former Yugoslavia, Croats, Slovenes, Macedonians, 
Bosniaks, and so forth. The other question, i.e. of an 
administration or civil protectorate, is being carefully 
considered. Of course, contacts and work are needed for this, 
as well as pressure on the Serbian side to accept such a thing. 
  I can also say that there are different views on the 
solution 
of the situation in Kosova. However, these two topics are very 
serious and should be carefully examined. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, you mentioned at the beginning of 
the conversation that you visited Germany. On this occasion, you 
had contacts with State Minister Helmut Schaefer, Bundestag 
Foreign Policy Chairman Mr. Stercken, as well as other 
high-level representatives of the German Government. To what 
extent is the question of Kosova known and supported in Germany? 
  [Rugova] I can say that Germany is one of the first 
countries to have shown interest in the Kosova situation and it 
has done so for many years. Traditionally, it knows the Kosova 
issue quite well and has so far supported it. We hope that 
Germany will be more active, particularly now that it will be 
taking over the European Union [EU] Presidency from 1 July. Then 
after six months, France will assume it. During this stage, the 
German side promises to be more committed to resolving the 
Kosova issue. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, I think that another question 
that would be of interest is this: In all these meetings and 
political and diplomatic contacts you have had, how much is the 
role and weight of the Albanian democratic state, and the figure 
of President Berisha, felt in resolving the Kosova issue and the 
national question? 
  [Rugova] I can say that after 50 years, it is our good 
fortune to have started to have contacts and to cooperate. I 
can say that the role of the democratic power in Albania, 
President Berisha, and the government is very great. Today, this 
role is important as Albania is entering international 
institutions and organizations and represents and puts forward 
our demands as well. Albania's support is invaluable and should 
continue in this direction. 
  [Muharremi] Do you think that we have reached this stage, 
i.e. a pan-Albanian global policy? 
  [Rugova] I think so. We have taken the first steps and now, 
we are consolidating this policy. It is good that we have 
managed to start a common policy, an Albanian global policy 
regarding all topics and problems. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, it is clear that European policy 
in general, from the lowest levels up to the highest circles, 
manifests an evident concern and predisposition to resolve the 
Kosova issue. Of course, in this framework Belgrade's and 
Athens' positions seem to be out of tune. I would like to 
stress here the Greek Government's position regarding your 
participation in the North Atlantic Assembly proceedings. The 
Greek Government considered it an act that runs counter to the 
Atlantic Pact goals and impairs stability in the Balkans. 
Please, Mr. President, what did you say in the meeting in Oslo? 
  [Rugova] Unfortunately, there was some reaction from Greece, 
and perhaps Serbia. I would also like to say that a German lady 
chairing the Committee of Civil Affairs said that even the Greek 
delegation had agreed on my presence there. Regarding the 
remarks and accusations that are circulating, they have no basis 
and justification, as I presented the situation in Kosova, our 
political plans, and the question of a political solution for 
Kosova. These met with great understanding both in the Civil 
and Political Affairs Committees. The success is important. Of 
course, there will always be rumors and charges. 
  [Muharremi] What about the position of the Serbian 
Government, considering the kind of official reaction it 
maintained toward the German Government? Of course, the German 
Government gave its answer -- Rugova is the highest 
representative elected by free elections in a region inhabited 
mainly by the Albanians of Kosova. How do you assess the German 
Government's reaction in this case? 
  [Rugova] I consider it remarkably positive. I am used to 
these reactions by the Serbian Government, with various attacks 
and threats. That is why this is a sign of the nervousness of 
that regime, which wants to isolate the Albanians more. That is 
why the German Government accepts the legitimacy of the Albanian 
representatives elected by free votes in the elections of two 
years ago. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, do you think that these stances 
maintained by the Greek and Serbian Governments in the context 
of the events occurring in the region and the Balkans, and 
particularly in the south, toward which Greece is presenting a 
pretentious policy, are casual combinations or a fruit of old 
relations in the Belgrade-Athens axis? 
  [Rugova] Unfortunately, some of our neighbors have always 
worked in this way. We can consider this as either cooperation 
or coincidence. However, we request from the Greek Government 
that it be more tolerant, examine questions calmly, and 
cultivate good neighborliness with Albania and Albanians in 
general, as we are one factor in the Balkans. 
  Regarding the Serbian side, it is known that today it rules 
Kosova by force. We are making efforts to find a political 
solution to the Kosova issue. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, the ministerial meeting of 
nonaligned countries was recently held in Cairo. You sent a 
letter, a kind of message, to the leaders at the meeting. Of 
course, foreign policy analysts noted the fact that Serbia had 
not been invited to this nonaligned meeting, while it is well 
known that for decades the former Yugoslavia was, as it were, a 
country that relied on the nonaligned countries. Do you think 
that this is a strong position, a reaction of the nonaligned 
toward the current Serbian policy of violence and repression? 
  [Rugova] As you know, the nonaligned movement flourished in 
the sixties and seventies. By the eighties it had begun to 
weaken. The former Yugoslavia was a major country in the 
movement and one of its founders. Of course, nowadays when new 
states have emerged and are emerging from the former Yugoslavia, 
they cannot accept Serbia, which is employing violence and 
declaring war on other people and former regions. That is why it 
was a good move that the Kosova issue was included as one of the 
topics even in this conference. It was a good gesture for the 
Kosova issue and that of Albanians in general. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, a new element of the Kosova 
situation is, of course, the demand now being put forward by 
both political and state figures and the media for a dialogue 
between Serbia and the legitimate leadership of the Albanian 
people of Kosova. Do you think that Serbia is ready for a 
constructive dialogue with Kosovar personalities? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, there is a great effort being 
made by the international community, many European countries, 
and the United States to find possibilities for any dialogue in 
various negotiations. From the start, we have been for dialogue 
and for holding talks. So far the Serbian side has not shown 
any sign that it is ready to talk. We request that these talks 
be held under some supervision or in the presence of a third 
party. That is why there is the readiness at the international 
level to start something. As you know, two years ago we held 
talks in the framework of the Geneva Conference on several 
specific issues, but they yielded no results. Nevertheless, it 
is necessary to hold talks. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, there are rumors that Serbia has 
started a dialogue with separate individuals. Is this true, and 
do these individuals enjoy the mandate of the Albanian people of 
Kosova? 
  [Rugova] As you know, there have been contacts with several 
parties of the Serbian opposition by some of our small parties. 
Then, there have been contacts between Albanian and Serbian 
intellectual groups. Meanwhile, it is known that individuals 
can contact each other, no one can prevent them from doing so. 
However, it is also known who has the mandate -- the elected 
organs of Kosova. The various contacts that may have been 
established are matters that are up to the individuals 
themselves. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, I have another question for you. 
Some time ago you spoke about -- and it is precisely the topic 
we are discussing right now -- the need for dialogue with 
Serbia. This is, of course, much spoken about and President 
Berisha stressed it during his last visit to Romania, about the 
need for a dialogue with the legitimate leaders of the Albanian 
people of Kosova in the presence of a third party. Please, who 
is or could this third party be? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, for the moment, the definition 
of the third party is still.... As a side, we can say it should 
be oneof the international or European institutions. As you 
observe, the European Union, the United States, and Russia have 
committed themselves to the questions in former Yugoslavia. I 
think that in this connection a third party will be found for us 
to supervise the talks under the auspices of the United Nations. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another issue that I think is 
of interest and worth addressing in this conversation is the 
fact that much is spoken today, both in the international and 
Albanian media, about peaceful resistance having always been 
your political credo. This is and has always been highly valued 
in the world. Here I would like to remind you that U.S. Vice 
President Al Gore, who has praised your peaceful policy, German 
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel in his last interview with the 
ZERI newspaper, and Mr. Peter Albright, the U.S. ambassador in 
Zagreb, considered you the Albanian Mahatma Gandhi or Martin 
Luther King. Are you convinced that this is the way to avoid 
conflict and bloodshed in Kosova? 
  [Rugova] By all means. This is the way to avoid it. So far 
we have managed, fortunately with the understanding of the 
entire people, to escape a conflict, because as you know we have 
no protection in Kosova. Since 1991, we have been left with no 
protection in Kosova. Then, considerations about our movement 
and the resistance of the Kosovar people are in fact 
qualifications that allow the international and the Albanian 
question to be regarded as a stabilizing and peaceful factor in 
the Balkans and Europe. We have managed this through this 
movement, which is both a need and our choice. It is a need 
because we did not and do not want to move toward a catastrophe 
and a tragedy. It is our choice because, in this way, we have 
affirmed ourselves as a nation, as good-tempered people with 
high human qualities and with a resistance that will unfailingly 
yield its own results. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, during your visit to the 
countries we mentioned, you stopped over in France, where you 
had contacts with several French political figures. You met 
Michel Rocard, chairman of the French Socialist Party, and Alain 
Lamassoure, French minister for European Affairs. Can you 
please tell us what were the problems you discussed with them 
and what was their position on the Kosova issue? 
  [Rugova] Regarding these contacts, we have maintained 
several contacts with other French parties, and now with the 
Socialist Party at the highest level. As you know, the French 
Socialist Party has supported our issue many times. We 
discussed with Mr. Lamassoure the situation in Kosova and 
possibilities for a dialogue to resolve the Kosova issue. I can 
say that these are, more or less, regular contacts that we have 
established with France, the French Government, and French 
institutions. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, in this case, of course, it would 
be permissible to mention here in this live conversation your 
latest book, presented on the occasion of your visit to France, 
titled: The Kosovo Issue -- Ibrahim Rugova -- The Kosovo Issue 
[as heard]. 
  Mr. President, of course, the book embodies a part of your 
political opinions, a part of your attitudes, and your political 
and diplomatic activity so far. Can you please tell us how was 
the presentation of this book, which has political importance 
for the Kosova issue, assessed by the French intellectuals and 
the entire public? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, it was a special pleasure to 
present this book in the framework of my visit there. The book 
was prepared on the initiative of the Paris-based Committee for 
Kosova by Mrs. (Marie Francoise Allain and Xavier Galmichte), 
who compiled this book and worked a lot on it. They insisted 
that we should work together because, as you know, given the 
difficulty of movement, it is very difficult to enter and leave 
Kosova. They really managed to write a very good book, a book 
with interviews and long conversations, which present the 
question of Kosova and other historical and judicial problems in 
Kosova, i.e. what happened with the Albanians in a retrospective 
way. The book has an introduction by our well-known writer 
Ismail Kadare. It is important that in Paris, where we are not 
very well represented with literature, a well-known publisher 
like Fayard is publishing such a book at this time. It is a 
readable book, more a story with a historical, scientific, and 
political content than a discourse. I think that for the general 
public, considering the assessments given in Paris, the book 
would be very acceptable and popular for the Kosova issue and 
the Albanian cause in general, as I do not have time now to 
write books. 
  [Muharremi] Of course. Meanwhile, while we have been 
talking, we have received many phone calls from our brothers of 
the diaspora. First, a group of citizens from Switzerland wants 
to greet you personally on your productive work in the interest 
of the Albanian people and Kosova. 
  [Rugova] Thank you and we greet them together from your 
studio. 
  [Muharremi] Eva Konini, a citizen from Tirana, asks: What 
prospects lie in store for Kosova? 
  [Rugova] Everyone is aware of the situation there and you 
know that it is grave. However, I think that Kosova has very 
good prospects, as it possesses economic potential, rich natural 
resources, as well as, like all Albanian areas, a human 
potential, a new, active, and cultured population, 90 percent of 
which is educated. We also have an economy, though it is 
presently not functioning -- Kosova's economy was destroyed by 
the Serbian regime -- and this is a good basis for future 
development. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President.... 
  [Rugova] And of course, an open and not a closed Kosova. I 
always say this. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, here is another question: What 
is your opinion on the chances of parallel power in Kosova? 
  [Rugova] Ours is a legal power and the only power, but we 
are presently occupied. There is an installed Serb power, which 
is rudimentary. Our power there functions, as you know, in the 
school system, a system of solidarity to survive and organize 
our life, and this has surprised the world. That is why people 
are supporting us in this organized and very rational resistance. 
  [Muharremi] Another question, Mr. President, comes from 
Switzerland this time. Will the government be completed? 
  [Rugova] I have warned for a completion of the government 
and it will be done, but carefully and it will take time. As 
you know, a part of the government we had and we still have is 
in Kosova and a part abroad, for reasons that are known, as the 
government was not able to act several years ago. The 
government has performed and is performing many important tasks 
and, of course, through the strong cooperation we have with each 
other, with all Kosovar institutions, the government, and 
outside organizations. 
  [Muharremi] Another question comes from a viewer from 
Switzerland, who poses this question. Of course, he has in mind 
problems that have to do with Kosovar youths who are refugees in 
Switzerland and the efforts to prolong the stay of the youths 
there. This viewer asks: How do you foresee the solution to the 
question of the youths after their return from Sweden? 
  [Rugova] This depends whether he is talking about the people 
living there or not. Sweden has made efforts to return all our 
citizens there, but it has run into obstacles on the part of 
Serbia. We have asked that these youths be granted temporary 
residence. Many European countries have agreed to grant this 
status to these youths. In this situation, we can provide the 
youths with some vacancies, find some positions in our present 
system, such as in the university, the small private economy 
that the Albanians have. And of course, under these grave 
circumstances, we will leave no one to die of hunger. 
  [Muharremi] Another question.... 
  [Rugova] Of course, if we think of tomorrow, that's another 
question. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you is this: 
What is your comment on the visit of an Albanian Socialist Party 
leader to Greece? 
  [Rugova] It is true that parties and groups have the right 
to establish contacts. However, it should of course be known, 
direct information is needed, or a report by the state where the 
political parties or various associations are acting, because we 
often talk about the national question, but the national 
question is very concrete. We have a consensus, an Albanian 
global policy. That is why it would be better if all parties 
and groups were to remain loyal to this consensus, not to put it 
in stronger words, to be loyal to an official policy. However, 
contacts with good intentions, without inferiority, are 
important and should be developed. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from 
Tirana: What are your relations as president with the 
intellectual Rexhep Qosja? 
  [Rugova] They are very good. As you know, Rexhep Qosja is 
one of our renowned intellectuals. He has not entered any 
political organizations or parties. He is the leader of the 
Forum of Albanian Intellectuals. He has contributed with his 
writings and presentations and there are no misunderstandings or 
disagreement. He performs his job, and of course; I, as 
president, carry out my job, too. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question seems to be 
related to Belgrade preparations to appoint a new ambassador in 
Tirana. It looks as if it is going to be Zivorad Igic. The 
question is: What is president Rugova's opinion about the 
appointment of this Belgrade ambassador in Tirana? 
  [Rugova] I heard recently that he will be appointed here as 
ambassador. As you know, for years he has been the chief of the 
Socialist Party for Kosova, as there is not one of Kosova, but 
for Kosova. Unfortunately, he has largely contributed to the 
repressive situation prevailing in Kosova now. I think that 
this option should be reconsidered, whether Belgrade has decided 
to send him or not. Of course, Kosova has its own representation 
in Tirana and other countries. However, such people do not 
deserve to represent anyone. 
  [Muharremi] Our pan-Albanian public has continuously shown 
interest in the contribution and role of Kosovar intellectuals 
in the present processes in Kosova. Precisely that is the 
content of another question addressed to you. 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, Kosovar intellectuals have shown 
great commitment and, with the foundation of our parallel 
institutions and political parties, many of them have become 
members of political parties, elected deputies of the Kosova 
Assembly, members of various associations and the university. 
Their role is very great, of course including here the youngest 
intellectuals, as they keep the university and various 
institutions going. Under this grave and difficult situation, 
they, nevertheless, contribute a lot. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from 
Germany. Islam Kamberi puts this question to you: When is the 
Kosova parliament expected to convene? 
  [Rugova] We have so far postponed the meeting of the 
parliament, so as not to provoke any conflict. We can hold this 
meeting, I am not giving any time here, but we should be 
careful. It is important that parliamentarians are in Kosova, 
elections have been held, and several parliamentary groups are 
working. Some commissions of the parliament have started to 
work on the basis of the present situation. As you know, under 
such conditions, a parliament finds it difficult to conduct 
normal activity. Anyway, we will see our way to performing this 
job. However, a part of the parliament is working and 
functioning. 
  [Muharremi] A question from Zurich, Mr. President. Now, 
this question has to do with the present situation of the 
political parties and the Albanians in Macedonia. How do you see 
this situation developing? 
  [Rugova] You know what happened with the Party for 
Democratic Prosperity [PDP] there. I think that there is now a 
kind of lull and we should make efforts so that all parties can 
consolidate, be they large or small. However, a means of 
cooperation, a council, or something should be found for the 
PDP, as they should definitely be more individual. In the case 
of the present census, all the Albanian forces there should be 
organized. Elections in Macedonia will be held in the future, 
too. That is why we should make common efforts to consolidate 
the political organization of the Albanians there. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, recently as well as before, 
Serbia has concocted several trumped-up political trials in 
various main cities in Kosova. With these trials, Serbia 
attempts to accuse the Albanians of Kosova that they are being 
prepared for terrorism, to bear arms, up to the point of 
charging them with being trained in special camps in Albania, 
and so forth. Are these activities of the present Serbian policy 
an aggravation and an escalation of the violence and terror 
against the Albanians in Kosova, as well as an attempt to 
attribute to the personalities and the political leadership of 
the Albanians in Kosova the role of a destructive force, and not 
of a force that aspires for dialogue and agrees to discuss at 
the table of bilateral negotiations? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, this is an old song being sung 
to us. Thus, always with charges against Albanians, they have 
created that myth on the armed Albanians, and so forth. For a 
year now, as you know, there has been widespread imprisonment of 
various groups and the majority have been convicted from one to 
15 years of jail. These are simply trumped-up political trials 
to discredit our present policy, weaken the political position 
of the Kosova leadership, and of course, increase the degree of 
violence and repression. This is their main aim. As you know, 
no weapons or anything else have been found on those people who 
were imprisoned. They have taken people from their homes. 
Anyway, these are all fabrications so as to intensify the 
violence and repression and politically discredit the Albanian 
policy and leadership in general. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, we mentioned before.... 
  [Rugova] When Germany wanted to repatriate refugees, the 
Serbs said that they were trained there and they continued 
training. These are fabrications aimed at discrediting the 
Albanian policy. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, I would like to pick out a part 
of the interview that German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel gave 
to the ZERI newspaper. Mr. Kinkel stresses that the Serbs 
cannot refuse to the Albanians of Kosova what they request 
themselves for the Serbian communities in Bosnia, Herzegovina, 
and Croatia. How do you assess this statement from the chief of 
the German diplomacy? 
  [Rugova] This is an interesting opinion. However, as you 
know the Serbs and their regime have always acted with double 
standards. In Bosnia and Croatia they have requested their 
ethnic rights, as they have people there. Then they brought 
this about through violence and force. Meanwhile, the Serb 
regime refuses the Albanians the right to self-determination, 
the right of independence. Regarding Kosova, they always call 
upon a certain historic right, which no longer holds water in 
the modern, contemporary world. Of course, much would depend on 
the solutions in Bosnia. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, the next question comes from 
Germany from Nazif Bilalli. He addresses this question to you: 
Do you assess as positive the last visit of the delegation of 
the Republic of Montenegro in Tirana? 
  [Rugova] These are normal contacts that Albania maintains 
and will maintain with neighboring countries. As you know, last 
year the president of Montenegro paid a visit, then the foreign 
minister, and now the prime minister. These are positive steps 
of contacts, recognition, and cooperation. Thus, nothing bad 
comes out of these contacts. It is known that Albania has its 
own positions and policy and should cooperate with the others. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, in continuation of our 
conversation, regarding your visit to Denmark, the Danish 
newspaper DETFRI ACTUELLE cites you stating that "President 
Rugova declared: We have asked that the question of Kosova be 
treated in the framework of the global examination of problems 
in former Yugoslavia." What is the stance of the European 
diplomatic circles regarding this fair demand of yours? 
  [Rugova] Besides what I said and we discussed at the 
beginning, we have always requested that the question of Kosova 
be put forward in the global solution to former Yugoslavia, so 
that Kosova would be a direct representative in any possible 
conference that will be held. Then comes the question of 
sanctions, and I can say that there is understanding and 
promises that Kosova will anyway be included as a partner in 
possible talks on the global solutions for former Yugoslavia. I 
can affirm that there exist such a disposition not only in the 
countries we visited, but in other countries as well. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, in a conversation such as this, 
it is routine to ask you about the activity carried out by the 
government of Kosova. Of course, it is known that the Kosova 
government is regularly active in educational and health 
matters, in economic organization, as well as in slowly creating 
state structures. How do you assess this activity bearing in 
mind that it has to work under all these extremely difficult 
conditions? 
  [Rugova] They pertain to our entire organization and the 
government, that is, the part that is abroad and that at home, 
and to political parties, as we are in a situation in which our 
organs are functioning in Kosova under difficult conditions. 
For example, I can mention here the Democratic Alliance, which 
has a very good organization, various associations, other 
parties, institutions or local governments that we have, which 
are being strengthened every day. We can also point out the 
creation of several economic institutions, such as the Chamber 
of Commerce set up some time ago, then the organization of the 
economic and everyday life in Kosova. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, there is a question from Sweden 
from Haxhi Osmanaj. In this framework, he would like to ask you 
for a certain assessment of the mass media. He says: How does 
president Rugova assess the work of the RILINDJA newspaper? 
  [Rugova] RILINDJA is for the moment published in Tirana and 
Switzerland. There is a RILINDJA in Kosova, as well as BUJKU. 
We assess this very positively and RILINDJA has contributed a 
lot in informing the public at home and abroad. It is a serious 
newspaper and has contributed a lot. Its publication in 
Switzerland was an important step in keeping RILINDJA alive and 
preventing it from being extinguished. At the same time, it 
informed our public and people abroad that stability in 
information and in the information culture is being created in 
the West. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, Kadri Berisha from Switzerland 
asks you: What contacts does president Rugova have with Mr. 
Adem Demaci? 
  [Rugova] We have good contacts. As you know, Mr. Demaci is 
chairman of the Human Rights Council in Kosova, a very important 
association that is performing a great job. Then, the authority 
of Mr. Demaci helps us all, particularly his work during the 
recent years in Kosova. I can say he is not only a symbol of 
resistance, but he works and is in the framework of our 
resistance. 
  [Muharremi] Let us come to a question I addressed to you 
before through a viewer regarding the movements of young 
Kosovars from Kosova. This viewer from Germany asks: Is this 
movement, this departure of the youth from Kosova, proper? 
  [Rugova] It is not that we are trying to find arguments, but 
we should understand this on the basis of the entire situation 
in the former Yugoslavia. You know what happened with the 
refugees from the war front in Bosnia and Croatia. Then from 
the front of violence present in Kosova, which started first in 
1981, and particularly in 1989-90, young people have left, 
particularly for refusing to join the Serbian military service, 
deserters starting from Slovenia up to Bosnia. Regarding this 
exodus, the situation is such that we have requested their 
temporary asylum and have been trying to help them as much as we 
can. Meanwhile, I can say that recently there has been less 
movement, because many European countries have established their 
system of visas and various actions. However, on the basis of 
the present situation, this is important as people are alive and 
they will move and come back. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from 
Ejup Gashi in Norway. He asks you: How does president Rugova 
assess the Norwegian foreign policy on the option of a peaceful 
solution in Kosova? 
  [Rugova] Very positively. We have had contacts with Norway 
before. Like all other Scandinavian countries, this has always 
been the case in Kosova. We have had contacts with various 
delegations, associations, and the government. Even this time, 
we reached a very good understanding on the question of Kosova 
and its solution. We also consider the assistance that Norway 
is granting us through various aid and with the temporary 
shelter of our refugees, who were settled in many places there 
and have began to be integrated, in the positive sense, until 
possibilities are created in Kosovo. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question for you: A 
television viewer from Korce asks: Do you see the fight of the 
Albanian people in Kosova as a peaceful passive resistance or as 
a peaceful active stand? 
  [Rugova] To be frank, this is not as completely passive as 
is thought, because the people there are sacrificing their work 
and their lives. As you know, all this violence and repression 
goes as far as murder. That is why this is an active resistance 
and a resistance praised by the world. If other demonstrations 
may be called active resistance, we have also tried them several 
times, as you know. However, there is great danger as the large 
troop presence there presents a potential threat, because things 
may take another direction, which we would not want. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, a student from Tirana wants to 
know your opinion: Is it possible that the question of Kosova 
can be won through diplomatic contacts alone? 
  [Rugova] This cannot be done through diplomatic contacts, 
because as you know, there has been... Of course, we are a 
state and we have a policy. There are criticisms, opinions, and 
different viewpoints. The diplomatic contacts are necessary and 
important. We are on the road to success through the 
organization we have established in Kosova, through the 
resistance of the people, because the people are not asleep 
there, as sometimes may be thought in a simplistic way. 
However, we, and Albania too, should strengthen contacts and 
friendships. As I said before, the contacts that Albania, 
President Berisha, and the government have established today, as 
well as those of Kosova, are very important; as the saying of 
our people goes: A house cannot be kept without friends. Then 
there are international factors that have often supported us. 
That is why we should be ready and cooperate with them. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Shkoder comes back 
to the idea of dialogue. He asks: Do the conditions and 
possibilities exist for the development and start of an 
unconditioned dialogue between the two sides at the present 
moment? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, we have not set many conditions, 
because you know that such a dialogue would be unequal given the 
violence and total insecurity in Kosova. However, we should 
talk and, I repeat again, there have been no official 
indications of talks so far, but, anyway, we should talk. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, a viewer from Switzerland has 
posed this question: Which international factors, so to say, 
are supporting and assisting the solution to the Kosova issue? 
  [Rugova] Now, how to consider what these international 
factors are? There are special places and factors -- such as 
the international community, the European Union, the United 
States -- that have reached understanding and address and assist 
the question of Kosova. This is the international factor and, 
of course, depends... as well as certain countries that we have 
mentioned during our talk that assist the question of Kosova. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, Hysni Sopaj from Split asks: 
Does president Rugova foresee paying a working visit to Croatia 
and Slovenia to discuss the position of Albanians in these two 
countries? 
  [Rugova] I went to Slovenia some time ago. Now we will see 
with Croatia, as we have better relations, more or less. As you 
know, Albania has made contact with these two countries and has 
established good relations. This helps, but we will do our 
utmost in Kosova to organize a visit to Croatia soon. The 
predisposition exists, but you know the difficulty of these 
contacts, which were interrupted a year ago. 
  [Muharremi] A viewer from Switzerland wants to know your 
opinion: How does president Rugova comment on the threats of 
Arkan [Zeljko Raznjatovic, leader of the Serb Unity Party, SSJ; 
head of the Serbian Volunteer Guards, SDG] and Seselj [Vojislav 
Seselj, president of the Serbian Renewal Movement, SPO] 
regarding the eviction of Albanians from their ancient 
territories in Kosova? 
  [Rugova] These are continuous threats. We have become used 
to them. However, their ill-omened dream of evicting Albanians, 
suspending political parties, and exterminating Albanian leaders 
will not come true. In short, their dreams and demands will not 
be realized. As you know, this is a bad myth that has been 
inherited over several years or decades. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another television viewer, this 
time from Tirana, wants to know whether all the political 
factors in Kosova are in accord with president Rugova's stances 
or not? 
  [Rugova] All the political factors are of the same opinion. 
As you know, we have five parties in the parliament of Kosova, 
as well as the Coordinating Council of the Albanian Political 
Parties. We have reached consensus on the independence of Kosova 
on the basis of a referendum, the people's will, and of course, 
the demands put forward in our political project on the 
situation and organization in Kosova. Of course, the president 
consults these parties and is obliged, even by the Constitution, 
to listen to the parties, groups, parliament, and so forth. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, Nazmi Ramadani from Berlin has 
posed this question: Will our Berlin Wall be removed without 
war, as was the original wall in Berlin? 
  [Rugova] I hope yes and, not to answer so shortly, I can say 
we are working on it, the Albanian people in general are working. 
  [Muharremi] Ferit Ejupi from Switzerland asks: Why does a 
part of the government of the republic of Kosova act in Kosova 
while the other part acts outside Kosova? 
  [Rugova] In short, it is because of the current conditions. 
In 1991, when we founded this provisional coalition government, 
it was necessary for some government members to go abroad as 
they may have been arrested and their activity suspended. As 
you know, before this government, we had another government that 
emerged from the other parliament. We have also accepted the 
legitimacy of that government, while this is a coalition 
government. There is nothing bad here if opinions are 
expressed, whether it should be in Kosova, or wherever. 
However, we should be prudent regarding this. 
  After the 1992 elections, the situation changed. The 
president is in Kosova, as well as a part of the government. It 
is important that they function where, and how, we can see it. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, we have another question from 
Germany, which, I think, is seemingly related with the statement 
of Douglas Hogg in Prishtina. The viewer has posed this 
question: What is president Rugova's opinion on Bosnia's 
division and the problem of Kosova, as part of the former 
Yugoslav Federation? 
  [Rugova] Now, regarding the question of Bosnia, this has 
been accepted as a state, but the situation in the field has 
urged immediate efforts, such as the ethnic division, and so 
forth. This situation will depend a lot on the efforts to create 
a Muslim-Croat federation, headed by a confederation or 
something else. The Serbian side is abstaining from this. 
  Regarding the question of Kosova, it is known that we are 
committed to its independence and neutrality. We have also said 
that all the Albanian political parties in Kosova have reached 
consensus, and if there are changes to the internal borders of 
the former Yugoslavia, they will naturally be valid for the 
Albanians, too. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, another question comes from 
Switzerland: Do you think that the discriminating policy 
against the Albanians in Macedonia will change? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, the Albanians there have 
contributed a lot to the stability of that republic by being 
members of the parliament, participating in the government, and 
having a political organization. The Macedonian Government and 
the other institutions should be more active in fulfilling the 
demands of the Albanians, incorporating their institutions, 
schools, and faculties, and following a more active policy. I 
hope that this policy will be more active in the future and, of 
course, the Albanians will be better organized on the political, 
administrative, and judicial levels in Macedonia, because there 
is the potential, but we should be ready to find agreement and 
understanding. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, it seems from the telephone calls 
that there are many questions from the television viewers. 
Anyway, because of the limited time, of course, I would like to 
ask you two more questions before closing our live conversation 
on our satellite program. 
  Several months ago, the television started satellite 
broadcasting. Considering the contacts you have had and your 
assessments of the pan-Albanian general opinion, is the value of 
this satellite program appreciated properly -- not only in the 
sense of moral support, but also regarding the material and 
financial support to continue this program and particularly to 
expand it, so that this program reaches new dimensions of 
pan-national importance? 
  [Rugova] To tell the truth, several months ago, when we 
talked together, it was the start of this program, which is 
something very important and a great achievement. Of course, we 
should now make all possible efforts, with a better organization 
of the diaspora and with our people, be it with the government, 
the Democratic Alliance -- which is very well organized abroad 
-- with clubs, and with various associations, so that the launch 
of this television is assisted, because without such a studio 
today, our people, our nation would be more divided. We should 
do our utmost to keep it. I am not making any appeal to our 
citizens abroad, but we should work to realize this and keep 
this studio. And God willing, tomorrow we will have more. 
Anyway, we should be organized and carry out these obligations 
and duties, because we need it, above all, as it is in Albanian. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President, the last question, in closing 
this conversation. As is known, we are on the eve of 
celebrating the 70th anniversary of the June democratic 
revolution. Do you see parallels today with this important event 
in our national history? 
  [Rugova] I stayed here for these days in order to be present 
at this great, important celebration of our renowned figure, Fan 
Noli, who, throughout his life, worked in politics and fought 
for the realization of the national rights of Albanians. I can 
say that a parallel can be drawn regarding the democratic ideas 
and the democratic progress. Albanians today are different from 
the Albanians of the Twenties, fortunately, and it is easier to 
accomplish the mechanism of democracy and the national 
interests. Once again I want to show my great respect and great 
thanks to our great Noli, as they say. At the same time, this 
is a good opportunity for Albania to celebrate this important 
moment. 
  [Muharremi] Mr. President.... 
  [Rugova] And we should continue this. 
  [Muharremi] In closing, I want to thank you for this very 
friendly conversation, hoping that through this talk we provided 
the pan-national broad public with ample information on the main 
problems that worry us today. I would also like to send thanks 
to all the television viewers who watched our broadcast and 
greetings from the staff of the Radio Television and the 
Satellite Program, hoping that you will come to our studio 
again. Thank you once again. 
  [Rugova] Thank you. Warm greetings to all. You are welcome 
to come to Prishtina soon.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Natality in Kosova Under the Target </F>
of Serbian Regime" -- issued by the Democratic League of Kosovo] 
  [Text] In spite of continued discrimination exercised by 
Serbian regime in the Kosova health system in order to reach 
"demographic equilibrium" Serbian doctors have recently publicly 
declared that they were not satisfied with the last three years 
achievements. 
  In order to gain in political life, Serb doctors call on 
Milosevic administration to radicalize their policy towards 
preventing the natality of Albanians. 
  Alexander Andrijevic, installed director of the maternity 
ward in the Clinic in Prishtina, told Serb-run Prishtina 
Television, that besides the measures taken up to date, "births 
for the Republic of Kosova continue and there is no sign that 
the rate of birth among the primitive world of Albanians will 
drop." 
  Recent public declarations of Andrijevic finally reveal 
their 
clear political intentions. He was determined to "stop this flow 
of babies," even if he must commit crimes. The project in which 
Andrijevic is engaged intends to control the birth rate by 
deciding how many babies should live and how many should die, 
how many Albanian women should undergo surgery in order to 
eliminate their uterus, etc. Yet, in order to reach some 
results, Andrijevic requires the assistance of Serbian 
administration, ends an article published by today's 
Prishtina-based BUJKU.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Strategic Point at Straza Seized"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday a team of NOVA MAKEDONIJA journalists went 
near a zone that has been occupied by members of the regular 
Yugoslav Army, 250 meters into Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] territory. They also control a 
strategic point on Mount Straza near Kriva Palanka, including 50 
additional meters of territory, and therefore there is all 
together 300 meters of territory under their control. 
Macedonian Army patrols are being turned away from this area 
with the following words: "Do not approach -- this is Serbia." 
Members of the U.S. UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] also took 
up their positions yesterday. However, it is evident that the 
Serbian Army does not have any intention of withdrawing. 
  For the chief of the Yugoslav Army General Staff, Momcilo 
Perisic, the events on the Macedonian-Serbian border are nothing 
but a media lie. Moreover, Perisic stated that Macedonia 
accepted the UN forces, within which the Americans are the most 
numerous, not for the sake of protecting the Macedonian people, 
but for the sake of forming their own base.

<F P=106> [Report by Panta Dzambazovski and Z. Cvetanovska: "Serbian </F>
Soldiers Are Entrenching"] 
  [Text] The thick fog around the border region near the 
village of Cupino Brdo, in the district of Kriva Palanka, 
prevented us from seeing the Serbian soldiers who, after 
penetrating 250 meters into Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] territory, now control a 
strategic height 1703 meters above ground level. If there had 
not been a strong wind blowing toward the seized zone, we might 
even have heard their voices. We managed to approach them to 
within some 120 meters. 
  This was the farthest point that we could reach, and we were 
escorted there by Dusko Spasevski, one of the members of the 
Macedonian Army [ARM] camping near the border -- about 40 
minutes away on foot. The ARM patrols usually come to 100-200 
meters from the strategic point on the Straza mountain, where 
the Serbian soldiers of the regular Yugoslav Army are being 
entrenched. They have already dug trenches and positioned 
machine-gun nests there. When the weather allows, the Macedonian 
soldiers can see the Serbian patrols changing over. Sometimes 
they communicate for a whole hour, but the conversations go as 
follows: "Do not approach, this is Serbia." Sometimes they 
send invitations for discussions: "Come to negotiate, let us 
agree." The members of our army do not react. In the vicinity 
we also met a five-member Macedonian patrol headed by Lieutenant 
Enver Jakupi. 
  It seems that this point is of importance for the Serbian 
army because of its strategic character, and not because it is 
allegedly on "Serbian territory." Actually, the district real 
estate registry offices have always worked diligently, and 
therefore this border belt has never been disputed. The essence 
is that this point is a good observation point for a large 
stretch of Macedonian territory. From there it is possible to 
observe the border posts at Ramna Niva, German, and Kopriva 
(with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), Deve Bair (with 
Bulgaria), and up to the mountains of Osogovo. The previous 
position of the Serbian army was behind this elevation, near a 
settlement in Yugoslavia by the name of Cuka, which did not 
offer such possibilities. 
  According to some information, the Serbian soldiers have 
been 
here for a whole month. Their patrols are usually composed of 
eight members. They carry some small arms, but some claim that 
they have also deployed mortars. At this moment, it is probably 
the surveillance equipment that is the most important weapon in 
use, and this is surely also directed at UNPROFOR members. 
  We have also found out something else that is exclusively 
revealed in our newspaper. Namely, the Serbian soldiers have 
not penetrated 250 meters into our territory, but 300 meters. 
To be more precise, when approached by Macedonian military 
patrols, the Serbian soldiers descend 50 meters from the 
elevation and take up a new position more suitable for attacks 
and for defense. Before taking over this strategic elevation, 
the Serbian army had deployed some reservists near the villages 
of Surlica and Prolesje in Yugoslavia. 
  On the Macedonian side the nearest settlements are the 
villages of Podrzikonj and Luke, whose inhabitants are deeply 
worried. A number of them have land just on the border. They 
cannot go to this now. The Serbian soldiers do not allow them, 
and the ARM is advising them not to go until the situation is 
resolved. 
  Half an hour before the arrival of our team, at some hundred 
meters from the ARM camp, some dozens of UNPROFOR field vehicles 
of the "Hammer" type arrived, with U.S. soldiers on board. We 
could see that their intention was to stay there for a while, 
because they were setting up tents. 
  Compared with two days earlier, yesterday there were not a 
large number of ARM or police there. Actually, that had been a 
preventive measure because of the traditional rally organized in 
memory of Cupino Brdo, where Macedonian and Serbian partisans 
waged a joint battle against the Bulgarian occupier during World 
War II. This time, however, Serbian war veterans did not show 
up. 
  It is obvious that the Serbian Army does not intend to 
withdraw.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Dangerously Escalated Serbian </F>
Provocation"] 
  [Text] In regard to information on latest incidents on the 
Macedonian-Serbian border, Macedonian Defense Minister Vlado 
Popovski held a press conference last Friday, June 17. 
Reflecting the border situation in the past year, Minister 
Popovski said Serbian-caused incidents have occurred often in 
the last three months. Seven incidents were registered in June, 
the same number of incidents occurred in May and five such 
incidents took place during April, which is a high percentage of 
a total of 19 incidents since January 1991. The minister 
divided the incidents into two types: First, entering on the 
Macedonian territory by Serbian troops, and secondly, incidents 
between UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] and Serbian patrol units. 
The recent Serbian MiG 21 plane violation of the Macedonian air 
space is also an example of border incidents in this year. 
  In most cases, the Macedonian border is crossed by Serbian 
patrols, who enter as deep as up to 300 meters on to Macedonian 
territory, but they stayed longer then usual near the place 
called Cupino Brdo and the observing post Straza, Minister 
Popovski stressed. At the place called Golem Tapan, Serbian 
troops established a telephone communication with their base in 
Serbia. 
  The Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] has sent a protest note to the Yugoslav 
authorities on all the incidents, but the reply has always been 
a denial of such reports. 
  What really causes concern, the minister said, is the fact 
that Yugoslavia considers the Macedonian-Serbian border to be 
only administrative. This border, Popovski reminded, was 
regulated by the First Constitution of the People's Republic of 
Macedonia, and upon a conclusion by a joint Macedonian-Serbian 
committee, back in the period of 1945 to 1948. All peak 
elevations had been marked even then and the Serbian side never 
had a dispute over borders with Macedonia. It was the 
Macedonian side that questioned two points -- the place of 
Serupa and the junction of the three borders of Albania, 
Macedonia, and Federal Yugoslavia, as well as the Prohor 
Pcinjski monastery. 
  The Macedonian Army, evaluating the character and danger of 
such incidents, undertook measures of forcing Serbian patrols 
out of Macedonian territory. At this moment, there are eight to 
12 Serbian soldiers at the post of Straza and the Macedonian 
Army troops are only 100 to 150 metres away. The mechanism of 
peaceful forcing Serbian soldiers out of Macedonian territory 
has thus far been efficient, although both sides have pointed 
guns at each other at all times. As for the peak Straza, it is 
decided to make an effort to resolve the situation through 
diplomatic means, but if it fails, the Macedonian side will have 
to take the peak over and will do so. Besides this, authorities 
in Yugoslavia, as well as the United Nations and CSCE will be 
informed on the whole situation with a thorough documentation. 
  In a wider sense, the incidents could also be interpreted as 
an attempt to activate another political factor in Macedonia, 
especially before the upcoming census and elections, Popovski 
stated. This pressure is complemented by the Serbian Church 
threats to introduce cannon measures against the Macedonian 
Church. If the old confrontation topic of Serbs being allegedly 
endangered in Macedonia is added to all this, Popovski said, it 
could be easily explained as an organized mechanism of political 
and psychological pressure on Macedonia. Answering reporters' 
questions, Minister Popovski gave some further information. 
Firstly, he pointed out these incidents must not be interpreted 
as an aggression, despite the fact some Serbian troops have 
stayed longer on Macedonian territory; secondly, the Macedonian 
side will ask the international community to get involved in 
defining this border; and thirdly, Macedonia will request, in 
the context of the newly emerged situation, that the 
international community lifts the arms embargo.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Barbarovski: "Dangerous Serbian </F>
Threats"] 
  [Text] The Serbian Army is endangering the territorial 
integrity of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Some 15 soldiers went 
approximately 250 meters inside our country's territory and 
seized heights and the most significant strategic points on 
Cupino Brdo and Podrzikonj near Kriva Palanka. The soldiers of 
our northern neighbor now control the highest peak on Mount 
Straza. The information from the field is that for the whole 
past month there have been some major movements on the Serbian 
side, that tents have been put up and trenches dug on Macedonian 
territory. In the absence of official information from the 
Defense Ministry, the local inhabitants are gripped by fear and 
anxiety, even though so far no incidents have occurred apart 
from the seizure of our territory. The Macedonian Army soldiers' 
task is just to observe the Serbian military "breach." 
  This is not the first time that regular units of the Serbian 
Army have violated the territorial integrity of our country. 
There has been a series of incidents in the last three to four 
months, which announced what is now actually happening. The 
border with Yugoslavia has some disputed zones that have been 
avoided by the Macedonian side and UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces]. These zones were not defined by the border 
commissions, and now more relaxed times and a calmer atmosphere 
are expected in order to resolve them. The Serbian side knows 
this, too. However, it is keeping up the tension by making open 
threats to peace and security. Serbia has not stopped 
demonstrating its force on Macedonia's northern border. It does 
that when its warplanes fly over our territory, when its 
disguised soldiers capture our border troops, and when they do 
not allow UNPROFOR units to use the roads along the Macedonian 
border zone. 
  It would be naive to believe that this latest serious 
incident is not part of a strategy that is breaking through on 
several fronts. The entry of the Serbian soldiers onto our 
territory just before the beginning of the census coincides with 
the open threats by the political associations of the Serbs in 
Macedonia to boycott the census because of their "not regulated 
citizenship status" and because allegedly "85 percent of the 
Serbian population" has not been provided with citizenship 
documents from the Interior Ministry. At the same time there are 
claims that "surnames are being changed, particularly of Serbs 
who have lived in Macedonia for a long time." 
  On the other hand, the Serbian Orthodox Church and its 
"administrators for Macedonia" "recommend" that the Macedonian 
Orthodox Church ultimately return to its "canonic mother," 
reinforcing its threats with border provocations. 
  All this, supported by part of the Serbian state press, 
which 
uses the strongest symbols, archaic pictures, and mythological 
formulas ("Serbian country," "autochthonous people," "old 
homes," "graves of Serbian soldiers") is aimed not only at 
providing an excuse for the "warmongers" but also at creating a 
psychosis in Serbia about danger, which is the only possible way 
to maintain the ruling oligarchy. That is why the comments of 
the military leadership of Serbia on the incident near Kriva 
Palanka was so dismissive: "It is something that Macedonian 
journalists have made up." Just as the Bosnian model was also a 
"journalist's invention": provocation -- incident -- military 
conflict. 
  Facing this great Serbian military pressure it is strange 
that the Macedonian Government, the Defense Ministry, and the 
General Staff of the Macedonian Army are taking such an 
attitude. It is true that the minister responsible and chief of 
the military leadership are outside the country, but the public 
cannot be left without relevant information in such cases. We 
do not know if the international bodies have been informed about 
the incident, which could exert pressure on the Serbian state 
leadership to withdraw their soldiers from Macedonian territory. 
The issue of the disputed border regions should be resolved as 
soon as possible, but only through negotiations. No other 
argument can fill in the "geographical holes." Unless the 
Bosnian war mania has come down to the south.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on news conference by FYROM Interior </F>
Minister Ljubomir Frckovski on 15 June: "The Interior Ministry 
Does Not Break Up Parties"] 
  [Text] At yesterday's news conference the interior 
minister briefly reviewed the preelection political situation 
and fervor, and said that, depending on their profile and 
internal structures, the parties are using different methods to 
try to provide excuses for various political situations, but, as 
he said, the Interior Ministry does not intend to provide such 
excuses. Some of the attacks that have appeared on the public 
political scene have accused the Interior Ministry of 
infiltrating and breaking up various parties with the intention 
of dispatching them from the political scene. This is a known 
methodology used by a number of political parties in the past 
for plotting, and it is usually studied as part of the lesson on 
promoting global revolution. The general characteristic of 
revolutionary parties is the syndrome of conspiring and 
searching for conspirators engaged in breaking up a group and 
creating a new one. Frckovski emphasized that no police force 
has ever managed to break up a political movement or political 
party. 
  It is neat when party problems can be covered up by such 
external factors because then we have a victim and an excuse for 
personal political defeats. However, we must be concerned with 
the low level on which the political struggle is being waged, 
making political pornography [as published] the main topic of 
political discussions. Playing around with confidential 
documents, trying to create party policies without having 
accusations investigated through a parliamentary or court 
procedure, or both, represent political manipulation, because 
they make serious hearings and serious democratic procedures 
impossible. There is no way to incorporate all of these into a 
procedure or to establish who is responsible. The aim is to 
satanize the authorities and to score cheap political points, 
Frckovski underlined. We can do nothing other than to offer to 
open our files and check the results, but that cannot be done in 
the media. However, I fear that the whole affair will remain 
within the sphere of political gossip. It causes great trouble 
when somebody's personal failure is associated with the 
political interest of a party. There were such manipulations 
when the Interior Ministry was accused of mass murder, with 
claims that it organized a traffic accident with five casualties 
in order to cover up the activities of one of its employees 
against some politicians. Such manipulations indicate not only 
mentally and morally disintegrated personalities, but also a 
situation in which there are no bounds in the political 
struggle. This is very dangerous for the political climate. 
  The State Security Service and the Interior Ministry cannot 
be blamed for a meeting, which might even have been accidental, 
between a certain lady, an ordinary secretary of the VMRO-SMD 
[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Union of 
Macedonian Organizations, a Bulgarian-based party], and some 
politicians of a certain political party on 26 and 27 March of 
this year, who were then given 50,000 German marks in financial 
assistance. The Interior Ministry cannot be blamed for the 
meeting in the Rila Hotel [in Sofia] when some well-known 
politicians of this country met a group from the VMRO-SMD, and 
were also joined by the Sofia district attorney and chief of the 
city's Interior Ministry. On that occasion they agreed on a 
plan for the election campaign, including the placement of a 
radio station on a historically famous mountain close to our 
border, all designed to help the party in the elections. Three 
groups were formed: one for ideological preparations and 
publishing activities, another for distributing publicity 
material, and a third for military preparations. The Interior 
Ministry can present evidence on these matters, but nobody can 
be blamed for the failure of the party except its own political 
program. 
  The claims that there was organized crime made us bring a 
number of criminal charges that we would not normally have done, 
in order to vindicate some statements made by former Interior 
Ministry officials, but that again is their personal problem. 
[sentence as published] The claim that we were allegedly not 
bringing charges so as to protect someone was an evident mistake 
made by the Interior Ministry to cover up political statements 
by operational work. [sentence as published] The legal case is 
closed that dealt with former minister Antoni Pesev, who issued 
a permit for the construction of a gas station without the 
permission of the Interior Ministry. I do not wish to make a 
personal inquiry into this mistake, but there was actually such 
a permit from the Interior Ministry. After that, the government 
made a decision, which simply made things ridiculous. The 
mistake was used politically to cover up the amateurish public 
statements of that time. There still remains the possibility of 
slander charges but I do not know what my reactions would be 
then. What we in the ministry owe is at least an apology for 
having been used, at least a number of us, to cover up political 
statements made by some senior officials. 
  Concerning the events on the Macedonia-Serbian border 
Frckovski said it was in the domain of the Defense Ministry 
because it was about the border itself, not a border crossing or 
zone. He listed the incidents: One illegal crossing of 17 
soldiers and two officers occurred on 24 May 150 meters inside 
our territory, threatening a UNPROFOR unit; the airspace was 
violated by a Yugoslav warplane on 27 May; two soldiers 
penetrated 200 meters into Macedonian territory on 30 May; two 
soldiers went 200 meters inside our territory on 1 June; on 8 
June they set up a tent on our territory; they have dug trenches 
mostly on their own territory, except possibly for one. The 
situation is similar today. We have our forces positioned a 
close distance from there, but all of this is "frozen" until a 
settlement.

  [Text] On the eve of the census in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], representatives of various 
political parties and other associations have put forward their 
statements. Regarding the census, Mendu Thaci, deputy chairman 
of the Party for Democratic Prosperity Party [PDP], declared to 
the Albanian Radio and Television: 
  [Thaci] The public has been informed that in 1991, the 
Albanians boycotted the census held at that time. This was an 
expression of civil disobedience on the part of Albanians, 
practically the lack of belief toward the administration staff. 
  The Law on Census, which was approved some time ago by the 
parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, is in 
fact more respectful of minorities than that of 1991, but when 
attaching to it the bad will of the administration staff that 
applies this law, this means that Albanians will be 
discriminated from the beginning at this level. 
  Article 24 of this law states that nationalities here should 
be represented on the basis of a proportional number. In fact, 
this law is not respected, because according to the official 
data in 1991, Albanians were 21 percent and more, while now in 
the census commissions and registration groups, Albanians in 
this republic take part with 12.8 percent. 
  It is known that the Macedonian administration staff 
particularly creates a terrible confusion with documentation, 
especially in ensuring the nationality of this republic. At the 
present level, there are more than 60 percent of Albanians who 
have not arranged the problem of nationality. Moreover, 
something that was not in 1991 is included, which is the fact 
that all the Albanians who work abroad will be considered as a 
non-resident population and will not be counted. The census is 
really a very important act, but I would say that it is not an 
historic act. 
  The PDP does not bear responsibility for the failure of this 
census, because it is not this party that participated in 
drafting the law, various consultations in commissions, and 
lately it is not the one that voted for the law in the 
parliament of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The 
responsibility falls on those who make manipulations and such 
non-serious projects.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Criminal Charges Against Macedonian </F>
Church"] 
  [Text] Pahomije, bishop of Vranje and administrator of the 
eparchies of the so-called Serbian Orthodox Church in Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] stated 
canon criminal charges would be brought against the Macedonian 
Church at the Great Church Court, unless the Macedonian Church 
re-enters the canon union with its sister church in Serbia. 
This would mean the defrocking of all Macedonian metropolitans 
and the church excommunication of Macedonian believers. The 
goal of forming eparchies in Macedonia had been to protect the 
basic human and religious rights of the Serbs there, which are 
being violated, Pahomije said in his interview for the Belgrade 
paper POLITIKA. They also aimed to reveal the Holy See's 
intention to place the Macedonian Church under its jurisdiction, 
he added. The decision to bring criminal charges against the 
Macedonian Church will be delivered to its head, Father Mihail 
in person by a Serbian delegation, Pahomije [words indistinct]. 
  Meanwhile, the A1 television reports the Holy Synod of the 
Macedonian Church claims it has not received any letter or 
facsimile informing it of such a decision. The Holy Synod will 
discuss its relations with the Serbian Church at its next 
Wednesday session.

  [Text] Skopje, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- Eftim Ancev, minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and water management for Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --FYROM], speaking on his 
return from a three-day visit to Turkey, told journalists here 
that an aid package for about 10,000 tonnes of corn for 
Macedonia had been agreed. 
  "We held useful talks with Turkish Agriculture Minister 
Sahin 
and we signed a protocol on technical and scientific cooperation 
in the sphere of agriculture," Ancev said, and added that they 
had also discussed the possibilities of exchanging experts." 
  The aid agreement on 5-10,000 metric tons of corn and on the 
purchase of a certain amount under very favorable conditions at 
good prices is very important, he said. 
  The Macedonian minister also stressed the importance of the 
fact that in the future Macedonia will be able to export its 
goods to the Turkish market, "and to buy Turkey's products for 
very good prices and under good conditions."

<F P=106> [Article by "(vrs)": "The Damage Caused by the Soviet Army </F>
Will Cost Quite a Lot"] 
  [Text] Prague--The state will provide more than 140 million 
korunas [Kc] this year to clear up the damage caused by the 
former Soviet Army. This works out at Kc14 for each citizen. 
  First and foremost, it is essential to clean up the 
underground waters and the parcels of land contaminated by fuel 
and to dispose of the unexploded munitions the Soviets left 
behind. "The source of the damage, which is deemed to be 
Russia, has not spent anything on rectification, and it is not 
envisaged that anything will be spent," said Jaroslav Ruzicka, 
an Environment Ministry expert. 
  Clearing up the damage left behind by the former Soviet Army 
has already cost almost Kc400 million in the years 1991-93; this 
is roughly one-fifth of what, according to estimates, will have 
to be spent as a whole. 
  Ruzicka said that a lot of unnecessary damage was done to 
the 
environment because the withdrawal of the Soviet troops from the 
Republic was very sudden. "In Germany, the Russians' withdrawal 
has been staggered over a period of several years, and so it is 
under greater control," he said. Ruzicka commented, however, 
that the damage caused by the Czech Army is, to say the least, 
the same.

  [Text] According to Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, 
the Slovak Government will try to settle property differences 
with the Czech Republic before this year's Slovak parliamentary 
elections, which should take place in October. This was stated 
by the Slovak foreign minister during his visit today in Prague. 
More from Marika Taborska. 
  [Taborska] The present Slovak Government is interested in 
settling the remaining open questions in Czech-Slovak relations. 
However, according to Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, it 
is doubtful there will be enough time to settle the issue 
conclusively because of the fall parliamentary elections. Eduard 
Kukan talked with his Czech counterpart, Josef Zieleniec, about 
the current state of bilateral relations--in particular, as they 
relate to the division of former federal property and to 
international agreements. Zieleniec was asked what was achieved 
in discussing the biggest Czech claim resulting from the balance 
of accounts of the former State Bank of Czechoslovakia. He said: 
  [Begin Zieleniec recording] This problem is very old, and 
finding a solution to it is difficult. The key lies in the Czech 
National Bank's claim vis-a-vis the National Bank of the Slovak 
Republic. The claim amounts to about 24 billion korunas [Kc]. On 
the other hand, there are two separate claims to gold. One is 
linked to the so-called Slovak gold, which is symbolic and was a 
Slovak national collection, and the second resulted from the 
division. 
  However, I wish to say that these are two disproportionate 
claims. On the one hand, there is the claim of Kc24 billion and, 
on the other, the gold claim whose overall value is well under 
Kc1 billion. The gold is a highly visible, symbolic claim, but, 
from the viewpoint of the balance of mutual claims, it is not as 
important as the claim of the Czech National Bank vis-a-vis the 
National Bank of the Slovak Republic. For the time being, this 
question is frozen because we are dealing here mainly with the 
Slovak acknowledgement that this claim is justified. The 
question of repayments is one thing, but an acknowledgment of a 
claim is of key importance. [end recording]

"Economic Development From January to April 1994"] 
  [Text] Industrial output was 1.2 percent lower in April 
than in April 1993. The volume of industrial output during the 
first four months of the year was 0.7 percent lower compared 
with the same period last year; this figure was 3 percent in 
organizations with 25 and more employees. According to 
estimates, output in smaller organizations was higher in April 
and has been since the beginning of the year, by almost 
one-quarter. The production of goods was higher, in particular, 
in the paper and printing industry and in publishing activity, 
by 15.4 percent; in oil refining, by 9.3 percent; and in the 
chemical and pharmaceutical industry, by 3.3 percent. 
  Construction output was 0.3 percent higher in April; it was 
6.5 percent higher for the first four months of the year 
compared with the same period of 1993. During the first four 
months, output rose by 11.4 percent in organizations with fewer 
than 25 employees and among individual businessmen. 
  The number of employees in enterprises with 25 and more 
employees in industry was 5.5 percent lower during the first 
four months compared with the same period last year; this figure 
was 1.4 percent higher in construction. The average monthly wage 
during the aforementioned period rose to 6,185 korunas [Kc] (by 
13.7 percent) in industry and to Kc6,787 (by 13.5 percent) in 
construction. 
  The volume of cargo traffic declined in April in all types 
of 
traffic compared with last April. Compared with the 
January-to-April period last year, during the first four months 
of this year, 3.2 percent more goods were conveyed by public 
road haulage; 15.1 percent fewer goods were conveyed by 
railroad; and 25.2 percent fewer goods were conveyed by river. 
  During the first four months of 1994, sales of slaughter 
cattle fell by 9 percent, of slaughter hogs by 4.4 percent, of 
slaughter poultry by 27.6 percent, of milk by 6.6 percent, and 
of eggs by 4.8 percent compared with the same period last year. 
  Consumer prices went up by 0.4 percent in April compared 
with 
March; at the same time, the prices of foodstuffs, 
nonfoodstuffs, and services increased by the same percentage, 
while prices in public catering rose by 0.6 percent. 
  The number of unplaced job seekers declined further in April 
to 171,900 and was 13,400 lower than at the end of last year. 
  Retail sales in the January-to-April period amounted to 
Kc131 
billion and were 15.2 percent higher than during the same period 
last year. Expressed in physical volume, they increased by 6.5 
percent. 
  The overall volume of exports during the first four months 
amounted to Kc117 billion in franco prices and was 6.5 percent 
lower than in the January-to-April period last year. The decline 
in exports to Slovakia by Kc7.5 billion--that is, by 27.9 
percent--had a decisive influence on the reduction in exports. 
Imports amounted to Kc118.5 billion and were 10.9 percent more 
than last year; at the same time, imports from Slovakia fell by 
7.1 percent. So, the balance of trade ended with a deficit of 
Kc1.5 billion. With the exception of the countries of the former 
Soviet Union (a deficit of Kc10.1 billion), there was a surplus 
with all territories.

<F P=106> [Interview with Andrej Sabol, state secretary at the Czech </F>
Ministry of Defense, by Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not 
given: "Arms Companies Have Something To Build On"] 
  [Text] [Zabojnik] How do you view the possibility of 
cooperation between the arms companies in a situation where 
these enterprises have begun to compete, to a certain extent, in 
both republics? 
  [Sabol] The arms industry of the former Czechoslovakia was 
organized as a whole. After the federation was partitioned, the 
situation changed, but, nevertheless, what sense would it make 
to buy something expensive in third countries that we ourselves 
can make more cheaply at home? A solution would be to agree on 
mutually advantageous economic opportunities. In both the Slovak 
Republic and the Czech Republic, there is interest in arms 
production because arms, as an important source of funds for the 
state coffers, do sell and will sell in the world. 
  [Zabojnik] As a result of conversion, production was 
completely phased out in the Slovak Republic. Will there not be 
problems in reviving production? 
  [Sabol] The arms industry of the Slovak Republic is now 
working at 8 percent of its capacity. We do not want the 
industry to produce as much as before. However, we can produce 
in order to meet the needs of our armies and the armies of 
countries with similar equipment that needs to be renewed. The 
modernization of equipment produced in the arms factories of the 
former federation, the Soviet Union, and the Warsaw Pact 
countries could become the second and a larger component of our 
common interests. Each of these countries can carry out this 
modernization using its own capacities, but full modernization 
is not quite possible in that way. Purchasing expensive 
technology from Western arms manufacturers may also be involved. 
There also is a third possibility: We may reach agreement, and 
everyone, according to his possibilities, will help to meet our 
common needs. Now, the final problem is: To what extent are we 
really able to revive and develop cooperation? 
  [Zabojnik] What did you learn at the recent IDET '94 arms 
fair in Brno? It was possible to compare the products from both 
republics there. 
  [Sabol] I saw both the Czech and jthe Slovak versions of the 
modernized tank, and I spoke with experts from both countries. 
If we agreed upon joint technological steps, it would certainly 
lead to even better results and mutual benefit. Other countries 
do not give up their own arms production, either. For example, 
Switzerland is developing arms production that is more expensive 
than possible purchases abroad. When I asked why they were 
taking this course of action, they said: We keep the know-how 
at home, the arms industry means the constant development of 
technologies, and we provide jobs for our own people. This is 
also a way for us, I believe. 
  [Zabojnik] The Slovak version of the modernized T-72 tank 
has 
met with a positive response from foreign experts. How are you 
satisfied? 
  [Sabol] Some details can still be improved on ours as well 
as 
the Czech version. Jointly, we could get even further. I do not 
imagine that the Czech side is thinking only about its own army, 
but also wants, like ourselves, to assert itself abroad. This 
means jobs for people at home and making our presence felt in 
the world. We are also aware of the financial problems in some 
countries that want to modernize economically but rationally. 
This presents great opportunities to the producers in both 
countries.

  [Text] We have received a communique faxed to us from the

announcing that during an extraordinary session of the PDAR 
Executive Bureau they decided that the PDAR parliament faction 
would initiate the procedure of withdrawing the confidence 
granted to the government by means of a no-confidence motion. 
The communique is signed by PDAR Chairman Victor Surdu. 
  Another faxed message, which is signed by the PDAR

Senate and the Chamber of Deputies: 
  In accordance with Article 112 of Romania's Constitution, 
the 
PDAR parliament faction initiates the procedure of withdrawing 
the confidence granted to the government by means of a 
no-confidence motion. 
  Considering the reasons detailed in the censure motion, 
which 
presents the current grave situation in agriculture as a 
consequence of the government's inadequate activity, we express 
our conviction that the Senate and Chamber of Deputies members 
of other parliament factions, who have not forgotten those who 
voted for them, who are as concerned as we are over this 
situation, and who wish to solve the problems, will second our 
motion and sign the signature list initiated by our parliament 
faction, which, for the time being, is too small to accumulate 
the number of signatures necessary to meet constitutional 
stipulations.

<F P=106> [Report by Mircea Podina from Washington] </F>
  [Excerpts] The visit paid to Washington by National 
Defense Minister Gheorghe Tinca at the invitation of his U.S. 
counterpart, Defense Secretary William Perry, concluded today. 
This morning, according to schedule, the Romanian delegation 
flew by helicopter to the Quantico Marine Corps base in 
Virginia. [passage omitted] 
  Before leaving Washington, I asked him to draw up a balance 
of his visit in the U.S. capital. This is what he said: 
  [Begin Tinca recording] I leave with the feeling that the 
majority of the things I proposed to achieve during this visit 
have been accomplished. 
  First, I managed to convey the messages that had to be 
transmitted to the U.S. party regarding the military ties 
between Romania and the United States, between the Romanian 
Armed Forces and the U.S. Armed Forces, principally regarding 
our cooperation within the Partnership for Peace initiative and 
regarding security. 
  Second, I leave with the conclusion that there is certain 
readiness of the U.S. party, especially at the Pentagon, to 
further relations with Romania on a number of levels. Now, in 
the beginning, our cooperation actions might not be too 
impressive or spectacular, but their evolution is an undoubted 
and serious one, and this will certainly allow us to attain the 
goals we set for us. 
  I also leave with another conclusion, about which I am not 
very pleased, namely that Romania is far too little known in the 
United States, in Washington, and, especially among the 
political and security analysis circles, among the political 
analysis circles in the U.S. Congress. For this, I am not 
blaming the U.S. party, heaven forbid, and I am not blaming 
ourselves either. This is rather meant as an encouragement for 
us to do more and in a more organized way to make known our way 
of thinking in our relations, because as I have found, there is 
certain interest for such relations, so they have to be 
disseminated among the U.S. political media and among the 
analysis circles there. 
  The brightest aspect of my visit was the pleasure of handing 
over an invitation letter to Defense Secretary William Perry to 
visit us in Bucharest. In July, he will make a tour of certain 
Eastern European countries, and it is my conviction that 
sometime in July he will also come to Bucharest. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Virgil Magureanu, director of the </F>
Romanian Intelligence Service, by Ileana Lucaciu in Bucharest on 
28 May: "Old Mentalities Are an Obstacle"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Living Standard Determines the Overall Image of a Regime </H5>
  [Lucaciu] Law No. 14 of 24 February 1992 on the organization 
and functioning of the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI] 
defines the main role of this institution as follows: A state 
body specialized in gathering intelligence about Romania's 
national security. At your last news conference on 29 March, 
you said that the main threat to national security is the 
situation of the economy. Would you be so kind as to elaborate 
on this statement? 
  [Magureanu] I am not the best authorized person to give you 
an answer to that question and to corroborate the negative 
impact that the precarious state of the economy can have on our 
national security. It is more than obvious that there is no 
sphere of social life that is not affected by the state of the 
economy. First of all, the state of a country's economy is at 
the basis of social stability. In its turn, social stability is 
linked to the living standard, that is, to the well-being or 
poverty level of certain social strata, which can lead to 
discontent and tension. Some of these manifestations of 
discontent and tension can degenerate into extreme outbursts. I 
believe that you remember the regrettable phenomena in the life 
of our young democratic society, which were also caused by 
economic discontent. I would cite the last miners' incursion as 
an example of such a phenomenon. These are extreme situations. 
However, there are also other aspects, less visible at first 
glance, which are also correlated to the state of the economy. 
When the economy is in crisis, these aspects -- upon which our 
national security depends to a high degree -- cannot be 
satisfied, such as the national defense and the working out of a 
system whereby Romania can assert its interests, as a function 
of the geopolitical context in which we find ourselves. But 
then, regardless of what I said, the overall image of a regime 
is usually linked to the people's living standard, which cannot 
conceivably be ensured at a reasonable level without a dynamic 
economy boasting positive growth quotas. 
  [Lucaciu] Within the framework of its obligations, the SRI 
puts together various assessments and information on certain 
states of affairs, which it then submits to the authorized 
bodies: the government, presidency, and the Parliament. Even 
you confirmed that you have produced such information during 
certain situations. What was the efficiency of these 
assessments, as reflected in the concrete actions taken by the 
respective bodies, which represent the power? 
  [Magureanu] Indeed, we regularly brief the respective 
bodies, even on a daily basis. You ask me about the efficiency 
of this information? Well, it varies somewhat. Anyhow, the 
majority of our briefings have an impact at the executive level, 
where measures are taken to counter would-be negative phenomena. 
There are also moments when we make concrete proposals for 
various negative situations that arise, situations that require 
urgent measures to solve the problems. 
  [Lucaciu] To give a concrete example, I would recall that 
you notified the relevant bodies in connection with the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime contract [irregular sale of Romanian 
vessels to Greek ship owners]. As a matter of fact, the press 
has published similar revelations, too. Nevertheless, the 
contract could only be stopped by the justice bodies. 
  [Magureanu] Generally speaking, we are also concerned, like 
you are, with the negative situation of our fleet after 1990. 
We issued various warnings in this respect and, indeed, certain 
things were subsequently redressed. We cannot judge now whether 
adequate measures were rapidly taken at the time. However, I 
believe that our information has had an impact. But what is 
regrettable is the fact that all the people who could have 
played a positive role in solving these matters of utmost 
importance -- such as the aforementioned case -- have failed to 
act in a concerted manner. Their efforts were disparate at 
times. On other occasions, the problems were tackled from a 
partisan political angle. Several sequences of the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime affair were turned into political 
accusations against one another, which somewhat distorted the 
core of the matter. Thus, it became a political dispute, when 
it actually was a serious national matter, which should have 
been coherently tackled from the same position by all sides 
involved. 
  [Lucaciu] In such a situation, one must show some 
understanding for political passions specific to this period and 
perhaps to the temperament of some people, even though they may 
harm the final goal. 
  [Magureanu] In our society's evolution, it is somehow normal 
that the two of us, for instance, should be situated at 
different political positions. However, when strategic matters 
are at stake, which are most important for the national security 
-- the fleet is also such a matter, since it is directly or 
indirectly linked to our national security -- we should give up 
our partisan political attitudes. Political differences should 
only account for nuances, if they are properly conceived and 
brought up in the respective case. On the contrary, if the 
situation is seen from antagonistic positions by the sides 
involved -- for the sole reason that there are political 
differences between them -- then the solution to the problem 
will be further delayed. However, the dispute around the 
Petromin-Forum Maritime acquired an unprecedented virulence, 
hence the lower efficiency in solving the case due to the 
various partisan attitudes that have hampered the solving of a 
serious affair for our society. 
  [Lucaciu] Partisan positions are currently manifest in the 
parliamentary commissions, which examine and then submit reports 
on various matters. As a rule, two reports are drawn up: one 
for those in power and the other for the opposition. This is 
now happening in the Anti-Corruption Commission, which cannot 
submit its report on time, at the scheduled date of 30 May. 
  [Magureanu] My opinion is that when the problem of 
corruption at various levels is raised -- unfortunately we are 
often compelled to acknowledge the existence of this phenomenon 
-- political passions should be set aside and the law should be 
allowed to have its say. The relevant factors should help the 
law in this respect. But maybe even we, as an institution, have 
not been doing a proper job in this respect, to the extent of 
supplementing the efforts made by others to clarify various 
cases. Maybe the rather poor correlation between us and the 
mass-media is also to be blamed for this, since we should really 
support each other. 
<H5>  Caritas -- A Negative Phenomenon of Great Proportions </H5>
  [Lucaciu] You told the press that you notified the relevant 
authorities some time ago about the danger posed by Caritas and 
the other so-called mutual assistance games. However, these 
schemes unfolded at will, until they went bankrupt, thus hurting 
thousands of poor and naive people, while enriching a few 
profiteers. 
  [Magureanu] From the beginning, Caritas should have been 
restrained by special legislation, which would have prevented 
the game from unfolding. I have stated my opinion on this 
subject in public on several occasions and I also took up the 
matter with various officials. Caritas was a negative 
phenomenon of great proportions, which not only swindled some 
poor people out of large sums of money, but also extracted huge 
sums of money from the overall economic circuit. At a certain 
point, the experts even feared a serious economic blockage -- 
there was indeed such a possibility -- due to the draining away 
and piling up of huge sums of money blocked in these games. To 
all this, one should add the artificial price hikes in the areas 
whether the Caritas profits had an impact and the dollars taken 
outside the country, after being bought at absolutely incredible 
prices, which were three or four times higher than the official 
rate. All this is the negative and very serious outcome of the 
Caritas scheme. 
  [Lucaciu] Therefore, you informed the relevant people. Why 
did nobody take the necessary steps on time? It seems that 
there is a crack along the three-stage route of information, the 
power's analysis forum, and the decisionmaking process. An 
interested or disinterested crack... 
  [Magureanu] There was a delay in the decisionmaking process 
in this particular case. Here, we may both agree on the 
implications of the problem. There has been much interference, 
at various levels. There was local pressure from those who 
could earn money from such schemes. There was pressure from 
certain people at various levels of power, who were given 
priority in receiving money from the game. Then, there was also 
pressure from the public at large. At a time of economic crisis 
-- here we return to the issue of the economic crisis, a problem 
that burdens us all -- people believe in miracles. There is a 
paradox with regard to miracles, namely that the less likely 
they are, the more people tend to believe in them and the 
greater their resonance. We witnessed the functioning of the 
miracle of general prosperity, at a time of crisis, when hopes 
in a better life could no longer be perceived in a normal way. 
To all this, one has to add the slow pace at which the legal 
bodies moved in this matter. We do not yet have a settled 
legislative system. In a healthy economy, the games of chance 
are strictly regulated and are not allowed to acquire such scope 
and what a newspaper called "such caricature-like proportions," 
as occurred in our country. 
  [Lucaciu] I asked you this question about the route of your 
information and its efficiency, because I could find no 
stipulation in Law No. 14 that you can legally notify someone -- 
the justice bodies, for instance -- to rapidly intervene in such 
a serious case unearthed by the SRI. 
  [Magureanu] Indeed, the law does not specify that. However, 
we are entitled to legally intervene whenever we can perceive a 
major attempt to undermine our economic life. We not only have 
the right, but also the specific duty to intervene in such 
situations. 
  [Lucaciu] What form does your intervention take? 
  [Magureanu] We issue warnings about the major danger posed 
by certain actions. 
  [Lucaciu] Who are you warning, the justice or the General 
Magistracy? 
  [Magureanu] Yes. 
  [Lucaciu] What if the Magistracy or the law do not take any 
measures? 
  [Magureanu] Well, you had better address this question to 
the respective institutions. However, I believe that we should 
also be more efficient in issuing appropriate warnings in such 
cases. 
  [Lucaciu] The SRI is an institution that is subordinated 
to Parliament and its activity is organized and coordinated by 
the Supreme Defense Council of the Country, which is headed by 
President Ion Iliescu. In what way are you subordinated to the 
aforementioned council? 
  [Magureanu] All our principal domains of activity are 
controlled by Parliament. However, as far as the day-to-day 
executive aspect of our activity is concerned, as well as the 
way in which we integrate ourselves within the framework of 
other institutions that by law are part of our security system, 
we are subordinated to the Supreme Council. We are to 
periodically report our activity to the council. Summarizing 
the whole thing, fundamentally we are under the control of 
Parliament, but in our current activity we are subordinated to 
the Supreme Council. 
  [Lucaciu] Besides the SRI, which other services work 
parallel to you in Romania? 
  [Magureanu] There have been a great number of allegations 
about those services. They have been enumerated and everyone 
considered that there are too many of them. However, the 
services operating outside the SRI are actually branch services 
[servicii sectoriale]. For instance, there is a 
counterintelligence protection unit functioning within the 
Ministry of Interior (UM 0215). Or the Guard and Protocol 
Service of the dignitaries (SPP) [Serviciul de Protectie si 
Paza], which for its current information has set up a so-called 
Center for Operational Information. And, as in all countries of 
the world, the Armed Forces have their own military 
counterespionage and information protection service. The 
competence of all these services is limited to their specific 
field of activity. And as you may know, there is also the 
Foreign Intelligence Service (SIE). 
  [Lucaciu] Does the SRI cooperate with these services? 
  [Magureanu] Yes, we do. Our day-to-day activity presupposes 
our cooperation with those services, in a way that is strictly 
regulated by law. 
  [Lucaciu] Under whose control are those services? 
  [Magureanu] Here there is a special situation. Whereas we 
are effectively under the control of Parliament, they are 
subordinated, as stipulated by law and other precise 
regulations, to the institutions to which they belong: To the 
respective ministries, or, in other cases, such as the SPP, to 
the corresponding institution. 
  [Lucaciu] The law stipulates that one of your duties is to 
protect state secrets and prevent the leaking of information. 
  [Magureanu] In every intelligence service the protection of 
secrets features within the spectrum of its activity. Since our 
work in this area can be characterized as general, it is only 
natural that we should also have broad responsibilities 
regarding the protection of state secrets. 
  [Lucaciu] You have personally admitted that there have been 
some cases of information being leaked to the press from the SRI 
itself. What steps have you taken to curb that phenomenon? 
  [Magureanu] I did not exclude the possibility of information 
being leaked to the press. But not just "to a certain part of 
the press" [reference to alleged leak of information about a 
number of opposition leaders and other politicians to the 
Greater Romania Party weekly ROMANIA MARE]. Some leaking of 
information did occur, it is true, but it was not deliberate in 
all cases. Sometimes it happened because some of our employees 
did not act correctly; we immediately took measures against them. 
  [Lucaciu] I understand that the SRI has reached the third 
phase in its reorganization, which has been done by 
restructuring in the name of the professionalism required by the 
specific exigency in such services. There has been a great deal 
of speculation in the press on this issue. In some cases even 
linking the restructuring to the areas where they took place 
[reference to replacement of SRI heads in various counties]. 
  [Magureanu] Restructuring has not been carried out in 
special areas. During the third, current, phase, we submitted 
the command to restructuring. I would define the essence of the 
current phase as follows: The transfer of the command over to 
the young generation. To a very significant percentage we have 
made that transfer to the new generation. In the future that 
transfer will amplify within our institution so that the command 
should be, to an ever-increasing extent, in the hands of the 
young people who joined the SRI after 1990. For the present, 
this process has just begun, but we made the transfer to put the 
command in the hands of a generation that, above all, has a 
better perception of the current role of our institution and of 
our fundamental goals. Please note that such restructuring did 
not occur merely in some areas of the territory, but rather over 
the whole of it. Over one-third of the command of our county 
branches, as well as in our central units has been revitalized 
since last autumn. 
  [Lucaciu] Article 4 of Bill No. 14 stipulates that upon 
request of the leaders of public institutions, public 
corporations, and so on, the SRI is allowed to disclose 
information about persons who are to be appointed in important 
offices in the said units. Did the presidency contact you in 
this regard, requesting that you disclose such information about 
the persons who were to be appointed presidential counselors? 
  [Magureanu] Yes, they requested it in quite a number of 
cases. But not in all cases. I would like to emphasize the fact 
that the law gives us the right to do that solely upon the 
request of leaders of institutions. This clause has been 
introduced deliberately. Thus we should offer objective 
information about the character, about the aptitude of the 
persons who are to be appointed to certain offices. In some 
cases they request such information. In certain cases they do 
not. Actually no institution leader is compelled to request 
such information, especially if he considers that he already has 
sufficient information about the person in question. At the 
time they discussed this law, the aforementioned paragraph was 
the subject of lengthy negotiations. I always stress this fact. 
Initially, that paragraph sounded much more imperative, as it 
stipulated that institution leaders are compelled to consult 
with us. That is when I also took the floor and I said that I 
do not wish our institution to mediate or to be responsible in 
any way for the appointments made in leading offices, as this 
would resemble the previous practice, generate suspicion, and it 
would artificially act as arbitration, which is not necessary. 
  [Lucaciu] Bill No. 14 also stipulates that the SRI organize 
and carry out the transportation of official mail over the whole 
territory of Romania, in order to protect the state secrets. 
  [Magureanu] This refers to secret mail, which it is our duty 
to transport. 
  [Lucaciu] You are aware of the fact that recently a top 
secret document, which had been elaborated by presidential 
counselor Colonel General Vasile Ionel and confidentially sent 
to Radu Timofte, the chairman of the Senate Defense Commission, 
was also published, partially, by the weekly ROMANIA MARE. The 
information contained in that document, once published, may 
affect national security. How would you term this situation? 
  [Magureanu] That was a leaking of information caused by the 
incorrect conduct of an employee. 
  [Lucaciu] There are several plausible variants... 
  [Magureanu] I know the dispute and I do not believe that 
things are as simple as they seem at first glance. I do not 
think that one of the persons at the two ends -- Messrs. Vasile 
Ionel and Radu Timofte -- are responsible for it, but rather the 
blame should fall on the incorrect action of the intermediary 
who transported the mail. 
  [Lucaciu] Will you ever be able to present the truth about 
this case to the public? 
  [Magureanu] If they request that we should interfere in this 
case, which does not directly refer to us... 
  [Lucaciu] But is the surveillance of secret correspondence 
not one of your tasks? 
  [Magureanu] The leaking did not occur during the 
transportation of the mail. Owing to the strict transportation 
regulations we have, such a thing would have been impossible. 
  [Lucaciu] Does the publishing of that document infringe upon 
national security? 
  [Magureanu] Of course it can affect national security. 
  [Lucaciu] And, under such circumstances, will you intercede? 
  [Magureanu] Yes, if we are requested to do so, because we 
were not involved in this matter and I am not sure whether the 
mail in question was part of the correspondence for which we 
normally ensure the transportation. 
  [Lucaciu] During a news conference you asserted that the 
level of your cooperation with similar bodies in the Republic of 
Moldova was not very good. 
  [Magureanu] No, it was not. 
  [Lucaciu] How is it currently? 
  [Magureanu] It still isn't. 
  [Lucaciu] Certain analysts claim that if one were to 
simplify things, currently there is an underground struggle 
going on in our country between two wings of the former 
Securitate. One consists of those who are nostalgic, while the 
other, those who are pragmatic, who adapted to the market 
economy, and support the reform. What is your opinion on such 
allegations? 
  [Magureanu] I think that such reasoning is a little 
artificial. I did not really understand your assertion about 
the former Securitate. These old structures no longer exist in 
our country. 
  [Lucaciu] I was not referring to structures, but rather to 
people. 
  [Magureanu] Those people retired a long time ago. It is 
true, some of them went into business, so that remark was 
correct. However, I would not consider them as champions of the 
reform. Similarly, I would not consider that the other ones, the 
structured [structurati] ones -- as you termed them -- within 
the former Securitate, exert a genuine, palpable, influence upon 
our security system. There are no such influences. 
  [Lucaciu] I did not mean especially the SRI, but rather 
their influence upon our political life. 
  [Magureanu] I do not believe there is such an impact, except 
perhaps to an extent that I would term as marginal; certain 
employees of the former Securitate have been called upon to 
carry out certain operations, let us say, professional ones, by 
certain political parties. However, in my opinion such cases 
are not very significant. 
  [Lucaciu] Do you think that those persons have altered their 
outlook? 
  [Magureanu] To a varying degree, from case to case. 
  [Lucaciu] Do you not think that the inability to change 
certain conceptions is hindering the reform process? 
  [Magureanu] Of course, old conceptions, regardless of the 
domain in which they manifest themselves, act as hurdles. 
However, I do not think that it would be conclusive if one 
claimed that certain hindering actions could, to a relevant 
extent, be exerted by former employees of the Securitate. In my 
opinion, in our case conservatism may be traced back to 
completely different things. I would like to warn everyone of 
this potential error that comes of looking at things 
schematically. It is not a certain part of the former 
Securitate acting to hinder reform, while another part of the 
same echelons of the Securitate acts in favor of reform. I 
think this image is an artificial one. But we could talk in 
detail about this subject some other time. 
  [Lucaciu] Many people endorse this idea by the manifold 
underground ties the former Securitate people had. 
  [Magureanu] One oversimplifies things if one considers all 
hindering actions -- which are really there, one can feel them 
in Romanian society -- as the work of some former Securitate 
employees with old conceptions. The image of our current 
situation is much more complex. 
  [Lucaciu] Which are the factors, in your opinion, that cause 
such visible hindering effects? 
  [Magureanu] There are very many of them. For instance, at 
the local level and in the central administration there are 
certain corrupt or corruptible persons, who are interested in 
keeping their current advantageous positions and therefore their 
actions cannot be but hindering, going against the tide. 
  [Lucaciu] If one looks at reality, our current situation, 
there seems to be quite a number of persons interested in going 
against the tide. 
  [Magureanu] Again, one has to distinguish among things. 
Hindering actions cannot be explained solely by the existence of 
old conceptions and corruption. Such actions may also be the 
consequence of certain inadequate juridical regulations, 
loopholes in the organization, the wrong assessment of the steps 
that ought to be made in certain directions, and the unsuitable 
nature of the development programs at various levels. 
  [Lucaciu] I would like to mention the fact that I did not 
discuss all these issues with the acting director of the SRI, 
but rather with a person who is interested in political 
expertise. Do you intend to go into politics when you retire 
from the SRI? 
  [Magureanu] That is an issue that will have to be decided in 
the future, and in any case not in the near future. What I 
intend to do is go back to my former work, that is, education 
and research. However, other routes cannot be excluded either. 
As far as the future is concerned, I consider myself a person 
who still has sufficient time ahead of him, so there is still 
some uncertainty about my future options. 
  [Lucaciu] As a person who is interested in the political 
domain, do you believe that currently in Romania there are 
clearly structured political doctrines? 
  [Magureanu] No. And that is another reason for the 
continuing stagnation and hesitation. Although various parts of 
our political spectrum have been claiming their own doctrines, 
these have still not sufficiently jelled. Some of them have not 
even been adapted to the general European course either, despite 
claims that their ideologies stem from broader currents existing 
in Europe. There is discrepancy between the doctrines they 
claim to follow and the similar doctrines as practiced in the 
neighboring countries and, generally, in Europe. Besides, the 
level of our political culture is quite low. Unfortunately, 
this phenomenon is quite obvious. I have had the opportunity to 
see with my own eyes, even during public debates, persons who 
claimed they were followers of a certain current, a certain 
doctrine, and yet they were not familiar with its canons. 
Besides, there is also a kind of a circumstantial behavior, 
meaning that whenever they find a slogan that is useful for the 
purpose of their immediate political profit, they will not 
hesitate to adopt it, without pondering and trying to analyze it 
deeply first. A great deal of confusion is also generated by 
the very large number of political parties that currently exist, 
some of which -- and quite a number of which -- claim they 
belong to social- democracy or some other contemporary doctrine, 
without sufficient knowledge about those currents and without 
being able to explain either the Romanian tradition in the 
evolution of those doctrines or the way in which they evolved in 
Europe and in the world. All this sometimes generates a bleary 
situation with respect to the relation between those doctrines 
and reality in our country. 
  [Lucaciu] The absence of well-established doctrines leads to 
the personalization of our political life, to the accentuation 
of the role of the leaders. What importance would you ascribe 
to leaders in the life and representation of political parties? 
  [Magureanu] If one thinks in terms of what is specifically 
Romanian, one sees that this influence is palpably very strong. 
It is true, the phenomenon of personalization -- the 
personalization of power, one might say -- in the life of 
political parties and even generally in politics, may appear in 
the initial phase of democracy, but it may continue later on as 
well. However, in the two aforementioned cases the quality of 
the personalization is essentially different. In the case of 
our country, in the initial phase, within many of the political 
parties the leaders had an overwhelming role in the shaping of 
those currents, in their gaining credibility and even 
legitimacy. This is a fact that is valid not only for Romanian 
society, but for other societies as well. I mean the other 
societies, which similarly to us, are also in the transition 
phase. It seems inherent to me that personalities should play 
such a role in the initial phase of democracy. In some cases it 
may even have beneficial effects. 
  [Lucaciu] Under the current circumstances do you believe 
early elections could be held? 
  [Magureanu] This is possible. 
  [Lucaciu] Considering that the various doctrines are not 
clarified yet, how do you think the electorate could find its 
way about? 
  [Magureanu] The electoral options will be significantly 
reoriented. This is a normal phenomenon during the transition 
period. Today we have reached a further phase of reform. Let 
us not forget, Romania has made significant steps on the way of 
transition, and, although for some people those steps proved to 
be quite painful, their results are irreversible. This is also 
acknowledged by certain international bodies. From now on, the 
crucial issue for us is whether or not we manage economically. 
Our performance in solving that issue will be decisive for the 
option of the electorate. 
  [Lucaciu] Is economic success not the result of strategies? 
  [Magureanu] Yes, obviously. 
  [Lucaciu] That strategy is offered by the parties designated 
by the electorate. 
  [Magureanu] As far as the shaping of strategies is 
concerned, responsibility is shared by all those who, at a given 
time, share the state power. 
  [Lucaciu] Do you anticipate a positive outcome? 
  [Magureanu] I refrain from making forecasts. But if I were 
to do so, I should be moderately optimistic, while, in any case, 
manifesting restraint. If I were to make an assertion now, it 
could be superseded by the dynamic evolution of events and, 
besides, any clear-cut assertion of mine might be interpreted as 
an attempt to meddle in the normal course of political life. 
  [Lucaciu] Before the end of last month you held a meeting 
with the editors in chief of various dailies intended to better 
the circulation of information between the SRI and the press. 
What have you accomplished so far in that sense and what has 
the press accomplished? 
  [Magureanu] We are trying to refine our relations with the 
press through the press office, which we have improved both in 
structure and function. Moreover, we are trying to make our 
relations with the press more fluent in the case of issues of 
general interest. Those are issues that are equally interesting 
for both parties and which we could make joint efforts in 
clarifying.

<F P=106> [Report by Balazs Pocs: "No Political Cleanup Planned in </F>
the Foreign Ministry"] 
  [Text] The chapter of the government program on foreign 
and security policy and defense has been drawn up, it was 
announced at a news conference on 16 June at which a report was 
presented on the three-day work of the coalition committee of 
foreign affairs experts. 
  The negotiating delegations were led by Laszlo Kovacs for 
the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and Istvan Szent-Ivanyi for the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. There are no fundamental 
differences between the ideas of the two parties, Kovacs said. 
He added that the three main directions of foreign political 
activities -- Euratlantic integration, forming good-neighborly 
relations, and supporting the justified efforts of the Hungarian 
minorities living beyond the border -- are closely related and 
equally important, and they need to be handled in parallel with 
one another. 
  It is especially important for Hungary to become part of the 
European Union [EU] as soon as possible and on the best possible 
conditions, Kovacs emphasized. Until membership is achieved, we 
have to make the most of the options provided by the Association 
Agreement, and we have to make use of the opportunities to 
develop the agreement and to amend it if necessary. However, 
this does not mean that the agreement will be renegotiated. He 
added that the talks on membership have to be started already in 
this parliamentary cycle, and then a referendum has to be called 
on the issue. 
  The views of the two parties differ somewhat on the issue of 
NATO membership. The MSZP is in favor of holding a referendum 
on this issue after the talks on membership are completed. 
Although the SZDSZ would not oppose a referendum initiated by 
the public, it does not consider it absolutely necessary. 
  Without normalizing relations with the neighboring 
countries, 
there is no chance of an improvement in the situation of 
Hungarians living there, and the establishment of 
good-neighborly relations is also important for Hungary's image 
and integration, Kovacs said. The document prepared by the 
experts committee makes special mention of Hungarian-Slovak and 
Hungarian-Romanian relations, and emphasizes the importance of 
the next government showing a willingness to have talks on the 
[bilateral] basic agreements. These agreements will have to 
contain a mutual renunciation of territorial demands, 
recognition of current borders, and obligations to respect 
national minority rights in accordance with the norms of the 
Council of Europe and the CSCE. 
  The two parties agreed that it is the government's 
constitutional, political, and moral obligation to support the 
interests of Hungarians living beyond the border; this includes 
national minority rights, the economic development of 
Hungarians, and their local social self-organization. 
  Szent-Ivanyi said that views on the Foreign Ministry's 
structure were not included in the committee's documents because 
this will be the responsibility of the party that runs this 
ministry. However, they agreed that it has become necessary to 
modernize the Foreign Ministry's structure, to reduce 
compartmenalization, increase the efficiency of the flow of 
information, and to rationalize its budget. If possible the 
ministry's staff has to be reduced. 
  Talking about personnel policy, Szent-Ivanyi said that 
preference will be given to professional considerations and the 
Foreign Ministry will not have any kind of political cleanup. 
  In reply to a question, Kovacs said that appointing the 
foreign minister or deciding whether the ministry should belong 
to a single party do not fall within the competence of the 
experts committee. He added that, in the committee's view, the 
structure of the Foreign Ministry will also have to reflect the 
tasks resulting from the changed governmental structure. 
  In reply to our question, Szent-Ivanyi said that the SZDSZ 
is 
proposing the establishment of a ministry or office responsible 
for European affairs because, in the interest of Hungary's 
membership, it would be more favorable to concentrate the 
related issues in one hand. He added that it would be expedient 
also to jointly handle the issues of national minorities living 
over the border and within the country. 
  Emphasizing that this was his personal view, Kovacs said 
that 
the assignment of the ambassadors is for two to six years. It 
will be a task for the new foreign minister to examine which 
ambassadors' work is absolutely necessary and to ask them to 
stay on if possible. 
  In reaction to Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's remarks 
(regarding the resignation of Pal Tar, ambassador to the United 
States], Kovacs said that it is indeed a basic citizens' right 
to run in the elections on the Hungarian Democratic Forum's 
list, but to be an ambassador is not such a right; the two 
issues cannot be linked. It is doubtful that a person who had 
demonstrated his commitment to a foreign policy attitude based 
on a belief in historical mission and ideological antipathies 
and sympathies would be able to serve a foreign policy not based 
on these, Kovacs said. 
  Talking about defense, Imre Mecs (SZDSZ) and Gyorgy Keleti 
(MSZP) said that they consider it essential to maintain armed 
forces that could guarantee the country's security. The 
committee considers it necessary to continue to reduce the size 
of the armed forces and to draw up a long-term development plan. 
The draft reform plan of the armed forces has to be submitted 
to Parliament in 1995. The experts committee would like to see 
rescinded the government decree that planned to unite the 
Defense Ministry and the Army headquarters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, acting head of the </F>
parliamentary group of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Anna 
Dano; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Dano] Why is the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] not satisfied with the coordination right that is 
equivalent to a veto right and the four ministerial positions 
offered by the Socialists? 
  [Kuncze] Who said this is not enough? We have mutually 
learned our positions and this phase in the negotiations has 
come to an end. It is true that our desires were far apart, but 
we are negotiating in order to bring them closer. 
  [Dano] However, it is well known -- and perhaps you will not 
deny it either -- that there are serious debates over the 
distribution of ministries and the appointment of ministers and 
state secretaries. Would you tell us what this difference of 
interests is about? 
  [Kuncze] This is as if the press were controlling politics. 
At the same time, all that is happening is that we have reached 
a point in the negotiations where we must decide how to divide 
up the government positions among us. This has been given a lot 
of publicity, which is misleading because this publicity gives 
the impression that this issue has elicited the biggest debates 
or that this issue is the most important. The creation of 
guarantees or the coordination in 10 committees are more 
important issues. It would be really unfortunate to give the 
voters the impression that the most important issue here is who 
gets what position. 
  [Dano] In your opinion, what other critical points can be 
found in the agreement? 
  [Kuncze] For example, if we fail to agree in the committees 
and the members of the main committee also fail to find a 
solution to the problems. Differences emerging between the 
committee on local government and the constitutional law 
committee could be such problems. There are differences of 
views regarding the role of the counties, but we also have 
differences of views on what should be done regarding the 
constitutional law in the coming parliamentary cycle and in what 
order. 
  [Dano] It often seemed during the negotiations that the 
SZDSZ would not even have adequate experts for many ministries. 
Perhaps this is why you are sticking so much to certain 
positions, and this hinders progress in the negotiations. All 
this is surprising -- all the more so because, for the past 
year, the SZDSZ has been saying that it was preparing to topple 
the government; in other words, it was preparing for governing. 
  [Kuncze] This is not true. The SZDSZ has adequate experts. 
  [Dano] What is your opinion about the bill-package of 
Sarkozy's independent group of experts -- namely their proposals 
to modify the statute and the Constitution? 
  (Kuncze] We have been following their activity closely, and 
we knew the details previously; generally, we agreed at the time 
and, of course, we argued about some details. It is another 
matter that a comparison of programs is taking place at the 
coalition negotiations, and the proposals meant for the 
parliament will emerge based on this. However, if we compare 
this with the activity of Sarkozy's group, we can find 
differences. 
  [Dano] These proposals almost eliminate the candidates' 
independence and would turn parliament into a voting machine. 
  [Kuncze] On the contrary. They free parliament from 
unessential issues. This could open up more opportunities for 
debate, and the essence of parliament is to hold debates there. 
Our parliamentary group supports the statute modifications 
mentioned by our negotiating delegation at the six-party 
negotiations. But it is not longer worth mentioning Sarkozy's 
proposals because we would like the professional issues to be 
decided upon already in the committees. People should vote on 
the modifying proposals there and, after a strict control, these 
proposals should be submitted to the plenary session. There, 
people can vote in packages on proposals that most certainly 
enjoy the support of parliament. This would also reduce the 
time spent on voting. 
  Our parliamentary group also supports the proposals that 
give 
greater opportunity for the opposition to supervise the 
government, proposals that facilitate the establishment of 
investigation committees and set up rules regarding the ordering 
of days of political debate. We also support the idea that 
one-third of the deputies in important committees should be 
opposition members, because one-third of votes are needed for a 
proposal to make it to the plenary session. The fact that the 
opposition parties will receive more committee positions than 
their government weight will also facilitate the activity of the 
opposition. 
  [Dano] How can you guarantee a parliamentary group 
discipline according to the expected new statute? 
  [Kuncze] This is a matter of the statute of the 
parliamentary group. We discussed this matter last weekend. 
Everyone accepted that, as a government party deputy group, our 
parliamentary group will have to function according to new 
rules. There are only ideas about this now, and there is not 
yet a set rule regarding the absences. This rule will endeavor 
to make sure that there are as many people present as possible 
at the plenary sessions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Hack, member of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats delegation at the coalition talks, by Lajos Bodnar; 
place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bodnar] You have placed 
great emphasis on institutional guarantees, but less has been 
said in public on the personal guarantees. However, one 
interesting aspect has been discussed, namely the position of 
coalition deputy prime minister. This appears to be an unusual 
solution and, at first sight, it reveals compromises. The 
question is how this political position can be fitted into the 
public law? 
  [Hack] The coalition deputy prime minister is an institution 
that is half-way between the current setup and, let us say, the 
solution in Germany, where the institution of deputy chancellor 
is known, and this position was, for a long time, filled by the 
smaller coalition partner. In terms of public law, we do not 
wish to establish this position of "deputy chancellor" -- deputy 
prime minister. At the same time, in the government's statute, 
we wish to mention the fact that, during the operation of this 
government, there will be a minister within the cabinet who will 
have the right to agree on certain issues. I would add that his 
rights will not be decided by the ministry he heads, but rather 
by the fact that he is the person nominated by the smaller 
coalition partner. However, this will not be the minister who 
deputizes for the prime minister when he is absent. The 
government decree on the order of substitution can, without any 
problems, regulate that some other minister, rather than the 
interior minister -- if this position is filled by the coalition 
deputy prime minister -- should substitute for the prime 
minister in his absence. 
  [Bodnar] The disputed issues would be taken to a coalition 
conciliation committee in which both parties would have one 
vote. Do you think that this seems like a hallway to the right 
of veto? 
  [Hack] I would not put it as sharply as a right of veto. At 
any rate, the constraints to create consensus are included in 
the way of operation. Therefore, we agree on a solution that 
will, at one point, definitely bring the disputes to a consensus. 
  [Bodnar] The two parties made an important gesture to the 
future opposition in the distribution of the committee places. 
Does this have any risks, and in view of the known power 
structure, does it have a real stake? 
  [Hack] It definitely has a stake because the parties 
preparing for coalition offer higher positions and a bigger 
chance for participation to the opposition than what would be 
warranted by the proportion of their mandates. In my view, this 
is an important gesture and the majority in 1990 did not do 
this. It has a value and the opposition parties appear to 
appreciate it. I add that the six-party agreement will lay down 
these extra rights that will be due to the opposition only while 
the coalition stands. We have agreed that, in certain 
parliamentary committees, the proportion of opposition and 
government will be 50 percent each. One of these is the 
national security committee that was set up in proportion to the 
mandates in the previous cycle. We also agreed that if 
Parliament is to set up an investigation committee, the 
proportion of government and opposition in it will again be 50 
percent each. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Szilagyi Terezia Csaszar, deputy chairman of </F>
the Christian Democratic People's Party, by Jezso; place and 
date not given] 
  [Text] With the approach of the local government 
elections, an increasing number of right-wing parties realize 
the need for a common political stand. However, the extent to 
which this process of alliance can go is still questionable. In 
certain circumstances, Bela Csepe, former head of the 
parliamentary group of the Christian Democratic People's Party 
[KDNP], can envisage a fusion with the Hungarian Democratic 
Forum [MDF]. However, KDNP Deputy Chairman Laszlo Varga opposes 
the idea. We asked KDNP Deputy Chairman Szilagyi Terezia 
Csaszar first about this controversy. 
  [Szilagyi] The national, Christian-conservative parties will 
find it extremely difficult to obtain results in the local 
government elections separately. These parties should therefore 
seriously consider the possibility of having common candidates 
or dividing up the mandates among themselves, as the KDNP and 
the MDF did in 1990. I do not yet regard fusion as a current 
issue. In the long run, however, the right wing should also 
create a people's party-grouping which, in my opinion, starting 
from the integrating force of the KDNP, will also be able to 
bring the other three similar parties into a close alliance or 
even a political union. 
  [Jezso] You mentioned three parties. 
  [Szilagyi] In addition to the MDF and the Independent 
Smallholders Party [FKGP], I also mean here the United 
Smallholders Party. 
  [Jezso] You are the KDNP deputy chairman in charge of 
organizational matters. In your view, what should the 
organizational setup of the new KDNP be like? 
  [Szilagyi] We must renew the party's statute, as well as its 
organizational and operational rules. The party members' 
obligations, sphere of authority, and their calling to account 
are not yet clearly outlined. This is why there was no 
discipline in the party. I think it is useless to renew the 
ideological debates, because the KDNP has firm and deep 
spiritual and moral roots. I would like our party to become a 
well-organized, modern, European people's party, a party open to 
social issues. 
  [Jezso] In a recent television program, Laszlo Kover, the 
acting parliamentary group head of the Federation of Young 
Democrats, said regarding the possibility of a common stand of 
the four opposition parties that this should be limited to a 
common solution of technical issues. In his view, an opposition 
coalition would curtail precisely the variety of opposition 
possibilities and, therefore, he does not think this is a 
desirable way. What is your opinion? 
  [Szilagyi] Our party has repeatedly declared that it would 
like to work as a constructive opposition party. I see 
opportunities for the four opposition parties to create a 
uniform stand on specific issues. Otherwise, the opposition 
will have a very tough time alongside a two-thirds coalition 
majority.

<F P=106> [Report by Miroslava Belcheva: "Union of Democratic Forces </F>
Parliamentary Group Demanded Resignations of Three of Its 
Leaders"] 
  [Text] Public demands were made for the resignations of 
Filip Dimitrov, Svobodka Stefanova, and Edvin Sugarev from the 
SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] parliamentary group, following 
a meeting of the group, the scandalous proceedings of which 
leaked out at the trolleybus stop near the National Assembly. 
Sugarev justified himself, casting the blame on the group, 
which in his view was committing suicide. In a shocking 
interview given to a Sofia newspaper, Svobodka Stefanova made 
defamatory statements against Stefan Savov, Georgi Petrov, 
Mikhail Nedelchev, and Vesela Rasheeva, accusing them of 
plotting to discredit others and making offensive 
generalizations about their past and standard of education. 
Edvin Sugarev emotionally defended her. This prompted Petrov 
and Rasheeva yesterday to demand the expulsion of Stefanova and 
Sugarev from the SDS parliamentary group. In the lobbies of 
parliament, Stefan Savov asked Georgi Petrov to withdraw his own 
resignation. 
  However, the issue did not come to a vote at the meeting. 
Aleksandur Yordanov appealed for personal disputes to be 
settled, even by expulsion if necessary. 
  According to Rasheeva, the SDS will not disintegrate just 
now, but the sharp decline in its image makes it pointless to 
"stand together." 
  SDS Deputy Romil Popov declared that it was high time for 
Filip Dimitrov to resign. He angrily stated that Dimitrov was 
to blame for everything. He allowed people like Ludzhev and 
Michkovski to leave the coalition, handed over the power held by 
the SDS without the parliamentary group deciding to do this, 
provoked splits in the SDS member parties, and even permitted 
his own cronies like Vasil Mikhaylov and Edvin Sugarev to spread 
slanders. Popov said that for a year now he had been 
campaigning to remove Filip Dimitrov from the SDS leadership. 
He claimed that two-thirds of the SDS deputies agreed with him, 
including Zlatka Ruseva, Vesela Rasheeva, and most of the 
deputies from the United Christian Democratic Center, the RDP 
[Radical Democratic Party], and the DP [Democratic Party]. 
  The SDS parliamentary group does not have the powers to 
decide on my resignation, F. Dimitrov explained with a smile. 
Under the SDS regulations, Dimitrov said, he can only be 
removed from his post if five of the SDS member parties raise 
the issue in the National Coordinating Council and 10 of the 15 
parties then vote against the incumbent leader. If it so 
decides, the SDS parliamentary group can only decide to remove 
certain deputies from its ranks, but this does not affect their 
powers in the National Coordinating Council.

<F P=106> [Interview with Kiril Tsochev, deputy prime minister and </F>
minister of trade, by Boyka Bashlieva, in Sofia on 15 June: "I 
Do Not Expect To Work Miracles, But Welcome the Challenge"] 
  [Text] [Bashlieva] Mr. Tsochev, minutes after the result 
of the vote was announced, Stefan Savov [leader of parliamentary 
group of the Union of Democratic Forces] declared that you were 
a Communist. Would you characterize yourself as one? 
  [Tsochev] When on 16 May Professor Berov invited me and I 
was asked to stand for the post of trade minister, the first 
question that I asked was who was proposing me. The prime 
minister answered that I was his candidate and that he had 
agreed my candidature mainly with professionals in the field of 
foreign trade. 
  [Bashlieva] Do you know the identities of these 
professionals? 
  [Tsochev] They were not named, but Prof. Berov said that 
many of the people whom he had consulted had given, though it is 
embarrassing for me to say so, a positive assessment of my work. 
The condition that I set was that I do not want any political 
force to stand behind me, making me its hostage in the 
government of experts that I believe this government represents. 
  [Bashlieva] Did the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] 
set any conditions for supporting you? 
  [Tsochev] Certainly not. Our conversation was correct, in 
terms of finding out who I was -- where I had worked, what sort 
of job I had done, and they were pleased to receive a negative 
reply to the question whether I had been in the state security 
system. Was I a member of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party]? 
Yes, until 1990, since when I have been nonparty. 
  [Bashlieva] How do you explain that the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliamentary group did not invite you to meet 
them? 
  [Tsochev] Many of the BSP's economists do not know me. 
  [Bashlieva] Why did you accept Prof. Berov's invitation to 
join his team? 
  [Tsochev] I find this an interesting challenge. The 
know-how that I have acquired in 20 years work in state 
government and two years in the private sector gives me grounds 
to want to try to do something for Bulgaria. I would not like 
to sound immodest, but I come from private business and am 
materially secure, although unfortunately I will have to put my 
company into deep freeze while I serve as a minister. 
  [Bashlieva] Is life easier in private business? 
  [Tsochev] Yes, but my zodiac sign is Aries, so I am the kind 
of man who seeks a challenge. 
  [Bashlieva] You mentioned that you do not expect to work 
miracles. Nevertheless, what ambitions do you have as you 
accept your ministerial post? 
  [Tsochev] I have a few ideas, but first of all want to see 
what has been done so far in the trade sector. I will meet Mr. 
Karabashev [former trade minister] today. 
  [Bashlieva] Are you prepared to make any assessment of what 
he has achieved? 
  [Tsochev] I do not think I am entitled to do so. 
  [Bashlieva] Do you have any impressions about the team with 
which Mr. Karabashev worked, and are you considering making any 
changes to it? 
  [Tsochev] So far I have not met the team, but I will be 
meeting everyone. At this stage I do not intend to dismiss or 
appoint anyone. However, this does not mean that anyone who 
commits a professional gaffe will not go. 
  [Bashlieva] What are your initial ideas? 
  [Tsochev] They relate mainly to the foreign trade sector -- 
stimulating exports, protecting domestic production, and making 
it possible for us to recover our positions in foreign markets. 
In a week's time my team and I will announce a two-stage 
program -- for the next three months and until the end of the 
year. 
  [Bashlieva] Can you say anything more specific? 
  [Tsochev] One man does not make a team. Please let me first 
hear what the people with whom I am to work have to say.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Tatyana Vasileva: "Zhelev Considers Second </F>
Term in Office""] 
  [Text] The veto that President Zhelev is expected to 
impose on the laws on the judiciary and mass privatization may 
once again put him one step in front. 
  The personification of the amendments to the Judiciary 
System 
Act as "anti-Tatarchev" and "anti-Grigorov," as well as the 
personification of the reaction to them, may prove harmful; the 
laws at least should not be used as a means of obtaining 
personal revenge. However, it will certainly open the hearts of 
the people at 134 Rakovski Street [headquarters of Union of 
Democratic Forces, SDS] to the head of state whom they rejected 
more than a year ago. If, after lengthy consultations with all 
the parties concerned, Dr. Zhelev nonetheless decides to return 
the law to parliament for further drafting in the plenary hall, 
this will undoubtedly also make him a hero in the eyes of 
Europe, where people already believe that our judiciary is being 
recommunized. 
  Stopping the mass privatization act will also increase the 
president's rating abroad. Foreign investors are staying away 
from Bulgaria not only because, as a Balkan country, we are 
considered to be a high risk, but also due to the model for 
privatization that we have now been arguing over for three 
months. Although winning a few points abroad, Dr. Zhelev will 
nevertheless attract the wrath of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist 
Party]. The Socialists are already wondering whom to blame 
because their increasingly impoverished electorate has nothing 
to gain from taking part in the mass privatization. 
  It will be a veritable feat of aerobatics if the head of 
state finds another form of veto that will allow him to make up 
with the SDS without provoking an almighty quarrel with the BSP, 
and at the same time avoid damaging his image abroad. This 
would certainly mean that, after almost four years in the 
supreme office, Dr. Zhelev refuses to walk any longer along the 
edge of the precipice and is looking to win the soft, velvety 
caresses of the electorate. 
  If the president acts to set people's minds at rest, in 
contrast to the political storm that everyone expects, this may 
be interpreted as meaning that the head of state is already 
thinking about a second term.

  [Text] [Announcer] After speedily completed repairs, the 
No. 1 Reactor Unit at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant was put 
back into service. But, as our correspondent Veselin Angelov 
reports, the nuclear plant is operating at reduced capacity at 
the moment. 
  [Angelov] The reduced operating capacity was made necessary 
by the fall in electricity consumption throughout the country. 
In fact, only three of the six generating units are in 
operation at Kozloduy at the moment: These are Units No. 1 and 
No. 2, each producing 420 megawatts, and the 1,000-megawatt No. 
6 Unit. The remaining reactors are shut down for planned 
maintenance or for reloading with fresh nuclear fuel. The 
period of their shutdown is being utilized to introduce some new 
technical features, connected with improving safety of 
operation. This is a continuous process, prompted by the 
constant improvements in international standards and the 
requirements of the World Association of Nuclear Operators.

  [Text] The latest public opinion survey carried out by the 
FOCUS agency in May 1994 produced some interesting results 
regarding the more detailed and specific aspects of individual 
political entities and personalities. 
  While the list of trustworthy politicians is still topped by 
the "evergreens" (Michal Kovac, Jozef Moravcik, and Vladimir 
Meciar), it is interesting that precisely Michal Kovac and Jozef 
Moravcik, as well as Brigita Schmognerova, have become 
acceptable to broader sections of the population. It is 
precisely the acceptability of the sympathizers of parties other 
than his own that markedly distinguishes the present prime 
minister from his predecessor (sympathizers of the Movement for 
a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] make up 74 percent of those who 
trust Vladimir Meciar, while Democratic Union [DU] voters 
represent only about 20 percent of those who trust Jozef 
Moravcik). Similarly, whereas the popularity of Peter Weiss 
within the ranks of his own party is declining, he is becoming 
more acceptable to the supporters of other parties. According to 
the FOCUS survey, of all party leaders, Ludovit Cernak, Jan 
Slota, and Peter Hagyari enjoy the least sympathies in their own 
parties. 
  The FOCUS survey was also aimed at ascertaining shifts in 
the 
voters' base since the 1992 elections. The slightest shift has 
been ascertained among Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] voters--56 percent of those 
who had voted for these two parties in 1992 would also vote for 
them in 1994. Approximately half of the original voters have 
remained loyal to the HZDS and the Democratic Party [DS] (which 
ran in the 1992 elections as the DS-Civic Democratic Party of 
Slovakia), while 40 percent of those who had voted for the Civic 
Democratic Union [ODU] in 1992 would today vote for DU. Another 
interesting finding concerns the structure of supporters of 
individual political parties. Men, citizens with only basic 
education, and citizens over 55 slightly prevail among HZDS 
supporters. Citizens working in the private sector are 
underrepresented among them. As much as 92 percent of HZDS 
supporters are determined to participate in the elections. If 
they were to choose a second party, HZDS supporters would opt 
for the Slovak National Party [SNS] and the Association of 
Workers of Slovakia [ZRS], while they feel an aversion for the 
KDH. The typical SDL voter is over 45 or 55, and citizens 
without religious affiliation are overrepresented among them. A 
total of 90 percent of SDL voters are determined to participate 
in the elections. Other parties acceptable to SDL supporters 
are the ZRS and the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia [SDSS], 
while they have an aversion to the HZDS and the KDH. The most 
typical KDH supporters are over 55 or 60, with only basic 
education. Some 88 percent of them are Catholics, and 91 
percent would participate in the elections if they were held 
today. As other acceptable parties, KDH supporters name, above 
all, DU and the DS. They have an aversion to the HZDS, while 
their aversion to the SDL is declining. DU would be voted for by 
a disproportionate number of women and citizens under age 44. 
Supporters with university education are also overrepresented 
among them. Sympathies for DU grow with the size of the 
community of residence. If they were to cast a second vote, DU 
voters would give it to the National Democratic Party [NDS] or 
the KDH, while they feel aversion for the HZDS. 
  When asked about their motives to vote for a particular 
party, respondents cited four reasons predominantly: sympathy 
and trust, the assertion of group interests, the political 
parties' programs, and the political parties' personalities. 
The following motives are important for the supporters of 
individual political entities: sympathy and personalities for 
HZDS supporters, Christian character of the movement and 
sympathy for KDH supporters, the assertion of workers' interests 
and social emphasis in the party program for ZRS supporters, and 
sympathy and personalities for DU supporters (the personality of 
Jozef Moravcik is an even bigger motive for DU supporters than 
the personality of Vladimir Meciar is for HZDS supporters).

  [Text] Warsaw, 21 Jun--A conversation with President Lech 
Walesa started the first day of an official visit to Poland by 
Mary Robinson, president of Ireland. Lech Walesa, speakers of 
the Sejm and the Senate, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, and 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski welcomed Mary Robinson 
outside the Belweder Palace. 
  "Europe and the world are facing new tasks today. Since the 
Iron Curtain has ceased to divide us, we have to find new 
solutions," Lech Walesa said when greeting the Irish president. 
He described the relations between Poland and Ireland as good. 
  Mary Robinson, who is the first Irish president to visit our 
country, said, among other things, that her visit should 
contribute to making the links that already exist between Poland 
and Ireland even closer.

  [Text] Belgrade, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The Federal Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs notes with concern an escalation of 
accusations by The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] 
against the Yugoslav Army because of alleged violations of its 
border and actions provoking border incidents. Along the same 
lines are accusations that the Yugoslav Army is massing its 
forces in the border area with the FYROM and that `the Serb 
army' has occupied the Straza observer post on Cupino Brdo," the 
statement issued by the ministry says. 
  ``The Federal Ministry for Foreign Affairs deems all the 
accusations unacceptable and unjustified, and rejects them 
entirely. 
  ``The Yugoslav Army was deployed along the border as early 
as 
June 1992 and from then on it has been securing Yugoslav 
territory, along the border with the FYROM, up to the 
administrative borders of the municipalities belonging to the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At that time and for a long 
period thereafter the FYROM had no objections to the situation 
on the ground. The Yugoslav Army units deployed along the border 
with the FYROM fully respect their code of service, performing 
their duties strictly in the territory of the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. The FYROM's accusations of alleged border 
violations became frequent when foreign military observers 
arrived on the Macedonian side of the border. 
  ``The Federal Foreign Ministry believes that the aim of the 
frequent accusations by the FYROM authorities is to substantiate 
the theory of the alleged `threat from the north' launched by 
certain non-Balkan and non-European players for their own 
interests. Such accusations should at the same time justify the 
involvement and strengthening of the deployment of foreign 
military factors on the territory of the FYROM, as part of the 
campaign of stepping up pressures on the FRY [Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia]. 
  ``The FRY's policy toward all neighbors, including the 
former 
Yugoslav republics, is well known, and the attempts to portray 
it in a false light, such as those from the FYROM, are contrary 
to the mutual interests for the development of good neighborly 
cooperation, peace, and stability in the Balkans. The FRY's 
policy is based on mutual respect of territorial integrity and 
sovereignty and, in relation to the FYROM, also on the interest 
in normalizing relations and reestablishing broken ties and 
cooperation. The FRY will fully adhere to the principles of the 
inviolability of territory and non- use of violence in solving 
open issues. 
  ``Again describing the Macedonian accusations as illogical, 
unfounded, and unacceptable the Yugoslav side expects the FYROM 
Government to stop fabricating such accusations and, in the 
interest of peace, security, and good relations to put its 
actions in line with internationally recognized norms and 
documents,'' it is said at the end of the statement by the 
Federal Foreign Ministry.

  [Excerpts] Pristina, 20 Jun (TANJUG) -- The trial of 14 
ethnic Albanians charged with setting up "the defense ministry 
of the Kosovo republic" and municipal "military headquarters in 
Kosovo and Metohija," which has been adjourned several times, 
began in Pristina today. 
  Hazer Hajzeraj, who, according to the indictment, was "the 
minister" in "the ministry," was heard first before the court 
council. Hajzeraj, who had for a long time been deputy defense 
secretary and the commander of the civil defense in the Kosovo 
province, did not admit to being the minister, claiming that he 
had never organized "a defense ministry" or any similar 
association. He confirmed that he had had contacts with Fehmi 
Agani and Anton Koljaj, the leaders of the Democratic Alliance 
of Kosovo [DSK], but he justified this by saying that the 
meetings had been "informal and not specially organized" and 
that they had simply exchanged opinions on the situation in 
Kosovo. 
  He also said that he had not advocated the secession of 
Kosovo from Serbia and Yugoslavia, explaining that the "autonomy 
of Kosovo" was his position. 
  "I am aware that there is already one army in Kosovo and 
that 
there is no room for two armies here", Hajzeraj said. 
  Asked by the prosecutor to explain his contacts and meetings 
with the self-declared Kosovo prime minister in exile, Bujar 
Bukosi, Hajzeraj admitted that they had met three times in 
Albania and Germany. They discussed, as he said, "only how to 
protect the population and property." 
  He gave a similar explanation of his meetings with DSK 
deputy 
president Anton Koljaj, who is in charge of defense issues in 
Rugova's party, and admitted that his "expert assistance" had 
been required. 
  However, he did admit to having received certain amounts of 
money in German marks, but explained that this was "help for the 
Albanians sacked from work." [passage omitted] The trial 
resumes tomorrow, when the other accused are expected to be 
heard.

  [Text] Skopje -- Ljubomir Frckovski, minister of internal 
affairs of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], told correspondents that 
Macedonian politicians had held a meeting in the Rila Hotel in 
Sofia with leaders of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Union of Macedonian Societies [VMRO-SMD]. They 
allegedly agreed with them a plan of action during the period 
preceding the parliamentary elections in Macedonia. It was 
claimed that three groups were set up, to deal with ideological, 
propaganda, and military matters, in which the Rakovski Officers 
Legion was also reportedly involved. The plans of the 
"conspiracy" included setting up a radio transmitter in the 
vicinity of the Macedonian border. On the other side of the 
border, within Macedonia itself, the "groups" were supposedly 
intending to work to overcome the differences between parties 
whose stances were close to one another.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Petr Dudek: "Sobriety Above All"] </F>
  [Text] When U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Peter 
Tarnoff tactfully pointed out to journalists last May that, in 
foreign policy, the United States will continue to pursue only 
those aims that it can manage--and that have economic 
significance for Washington--many politicians on both sides of 
the Atlantic feigned great surprise. Commentaries and 
statements repudiating the surprisingly "resigned" and 
"isolationist" drift of U.S. foreign policy began to appear. At 
the same time, Tarnoff had only conceded something that was as 
plain "as the nose on his face." Perhaps he came up with his 
formulations a little soon. However, with the passing of a year, 
we can only acknowledge his good intentions. 
  The number-three in the U.S. Department of State underlined 
his view of future U.S. international policy yesterday and the 
day before yesterday in Prague. The stabilizing Czech economic 
situation suits the U.S. side. Tarnoff referred with 
satisfaction to the higher U.S. investment in the Czech Republic 
(roughly 30 percent of the overall volume of foreign imports). 
Viewed through Washington's eyes, the Czech basin [ceska 
kotlina] is a region that it does not have to take care of 
systematically because its inhabitants, within the framework of 
their potential, are taking care of it themselves. 
  Unfortunately, the issues that affect the fate of countries 
like the Czech Republic, issues that these countries cannot deal 
with on their own, will not wither away in this fashion. The 
security vacuum in which the Central European countries have 
found themselves following the collapse of the Soviet empire can 
only be filled under the given circumstances by membership in 
NATO. If, however, Moscow decides to put off the moment when 
its former satellites are accepted into NATO, no one in today's 
world other than Washington can influence its willfulness. Will 
it do so? 
  Tarnoff left this question, which must have come up in his 
talks with Czech politicians, only half answered. Yet he spoke 
extensively and optimistically, as was to be expected, about the 
Partnership for Peace, project and, in an interview with 
journalists, he rejected tactfully but decisively the criticism 
that has recently been leveled at this unbinding program in the 
United States. 
  The Czech Republic is far from being a state that would not 
let the key officials in the U.S. Department of State sleep 
peacefully. Visiting it, therefore, is not something that would 
"get hot" for U.S. diplomats. Tarnoff himself called off at the 
last moment in the spring his announced and carefully planned 
visit to Prague. 
  It is impossible to be surprised at the calm unconcern with 
which Washington dubs us self-supporting. Other countries, 
threatening to explode, merit U.S. attention more. North Korea 
is the most noticeable example. Even here, however, Washington 
is limiting itself only to what it can manage--and it seems that 
it can manage little. 
  Peter Tarnoff, who held talks in Asian countries last week, 
in reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY on whether Washington 
will be willing and able to prevent Pyongyang from producing 
more nuclear bombs, was quick to recall the success of the 
conciliatory mission by former President Carter. In return for 
Kim Il-song's allowing two international inspectors to remain in 
the DPRK, the United States will suspend its attempt to 
introduce sanctions. A meager victory--but in the spirit of the 
sobriety formulated by Tarnoff. Rather than dispatching the 
Army to force Kim into obedience, it is worthwhile for 
Washington to send Jimmy Carter to Pyongyang. The fact that the 
North Korean regime cannot be trusted and that the two 
inspectors will not prevent the production of further nuclear 
bombs in the DPRK has somehow been left aside.
