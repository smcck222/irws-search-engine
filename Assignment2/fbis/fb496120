  [Text] At the Chamber of Deputies headquarters today the 
leaders of the parliamentary political parties belonging to the 
Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] held a meeting that was 
also attended by CDR Chairman University Professor Emil 
Constantinescu. The communique issued after the conclusion of 
their meeting points out that considering that until now no 
direct answer has been received from Romania's president in 
connection with the request to present his stance in Parliament, 
the gathering of signatures of CDR parliamentary representatives 
is progressing to begin the procedure of suspending President 
Iliescu from his office. 
  The communique also says that depending on the way debates 
on 
the education draft bill and the draft bill on the restitution 
of nationalized dwellings continue in Parliament, the CDR will 
decide whether it is opportune to commence a parliamentary 
strike. 
  According to our correspondent Ioana Perdichi, during 
today's 
meeting they also agreed that a censure motion against the 
government should be introduced during the current parliament. 
They also sanctioned the draft of the censure motion text, 
which is to be submitted for discussion during the bilateral 
talks to be held with the Democratic Party [PD]. 
  The parliamentary groups of the CDR and the PD held a met 
this afternoon and elaborated the joint action strategy of the 
opposition. They decided to continue to gather signatures for 
the procedure to suspend President Ion Iliescu from his office 
and agreed -- in case the president explicitly rejects the idea 
of giving explanations in Parliament -- to actually begin the 
aforementioned procedure. 
  Regarding the censure motion, the leaders of the opposition 
parliamentary factions agreed that a censure motion should be 
introduced against the activity of the government, worked out 
the text of the motion, and agreed that the document is to be 
forwarded to the competent parliament bodies after the necessary 
number of signatures is gathered.

  [Text] The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]-SZDSZ [Alliance 
of Free Democrats] coalition talks ended a short while ago. 
Organizational and personnel matters were the focus of the 
talks. Attila Csaszar, our staff member, sent the following 
report from the site: 
  [Csaszar] The coalition talks ended just a short time before 
the beginning of this program. For the time being, here are 
some brief notes on the results. 
  The MSZP, the winner of the elections, will have nine 
ministries in the future government, while the SZDSZ will have 
three: the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Culture and 
Public Education, and the infrastructure portfolio [Ministry of 
Transport, Telecommunications, and Water Management]. Political 
state secretaries will be provided by the MSZP. Names have not 
yet been mentioned, according to SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Petoe. 
  An agreement has also been reached on which party will 
provide the parliamentary speaker. This post will be filled by 
an MSZP deputy. The three deputy speakers will be nominated by 
the SZDSZ, the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum], and the FKGP 
[Independent Smallholders Party]. The FKGP will have the 
opportunity to delegate a deputy speaker only if it signs the 
six-party agreement on parliamentary matters. 
  A preliminary decision was taken on matters relating to 
parliamentary committees. The SZDSZ can delegate the chairmen 
of three committees -- the Constitutional, Defense, and Foreign 
Affairs Committees. The chairmen of the other committees will 
be delegated by the MSZP. The opposition is still expected to 
make demands in this matter, however. 
  It was also said that in the current situation, the two 
sides 
might even sign the coalition agreements as early as Friday. It 
is also very likely that in accordance with earlier reports, 
Gyula Horn will be the prime minister.

  [Text] Sofia, June 17 (BTA) -- "Mass privatization will 
get off the ground and whoever tries to hinder it is bound to 
lose. I do not believe that the president will be the one to 
stand in its way," Prime Minister Lyuben Berov said after his 
meeting with President Zhelyu Zhelev today. They talked about 
mass privatization and the Privatization Act for an hour. In 
the last few days, the president has been holding consultations 
with experts, law-makers, and representatives of the private 
business and the public sector on the Privatization Act 
amendments providing for mass privatization. The president is 
expected to decide whether to impose a suspensory veto on the 
act by June 23. 
  Asked if Dr. Zhelev was going to veto the act, Dr. Berov 
said 
that it was up to the president to decide, adding that the 
balance was hardly tipped that way. "Referring the act back to 
parliament will be a losing move and I do not believe that the 
president will do it," Prime Minister Berov emphasized. In his 
view, those who advised the president against mass privatization 
were guided by self-seeking interests. 
  "In addition to the implementing regulations, the 
Privatization Act should be complemented with an act on the 
investment privatization funds," Prof. Berov said. However, he 
doubts that the incumbent parliament will have time to adopt 
such legislation. He said that all issues arising in connection 
with the Mass Privatization Act will be regulated by decrees and 
ordinances. According to Prof. Berov, the list of the 500 
enterprises subject to privatization is not final and can always 
be corrected, but it serves as a basis one can proceed from. 
  "I have been mandated by this parliament to work until the 
end of September and do a certain job, and that is what I am 
doing. If the application of the Privatization Act is delayed, 
then parliament will have its say," Prime Minister Berov said 
when asked if he would resign in case of a presidential 
suspensory veto on the Privatization Act. "Parliament should 
either revote the act or accept the veto," he said.

  [Text] Sofia, June 19 (BTA) -- Dr. Petar Dertliev was 
reelected president of the Bulgarian Social Democratic Party 
(BSDP). Mr. Stefan Radoslavov was reelected chief secretary. 
The congress elected a 101-member National Committee and a 
14-member Inspection Committee. Changes were made in the 
party's constitution. Until recently former members of other 
parties were not allowed to hold key posts for at least 3 years 
in locals and for at least five years in the National Committee. 
  The party's strategic goal is Bulgaria's transition to free 
civil society based on parliamentary democracy, to local 
self-government and social market economy, runs a resolution of 
the congress on the strategic goals and future guidelines of the 
BSDP. The party is for early parliamentary and local elections 
to be organized by a caretaker government. The BSDP disapproves 
of the attempts of the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] and SDS 
[Union of Democratic Forces] to pass amendments to the 
constitution to extend parliament's life to the very elections. 
  If the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) continues the 
boycott 
of parliament and obstructs its legislative work, there will be 
no elections this year, Dr Dertliev told a news conference later 
today.

  [Text] Sofia, June 18 (BTA) -- Forty-two minutes after 
midnight the 440-MW Unit One of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant 
was switched off because of a turbogenerator failure, Ms 
Yordanka Stoyanova, head of the Public Relations Department told 
BTA. It was a short circuit in the conventional equipment and 
has nothing to do with the reactor's safety. No radiation 
changes have been registered. The unit was switched on again 
about noon. It will work at about 50 per cent of its capacity 
until the turbogenerator is repaired. Three of the six units of 
the plant are currently in operation. Their capacity totals 
about 1,600 MW. Units Four and Five are undergoing routine 
repairs.

  [Text] Geneva, June 20 (BTA) -- Bulgaria's permanent 
representative at the United Nations Valentin Dobrev briefed 
international mediators on former Yugoslavia Lord David Owen and 
Thorvald Stoltenberg on Bulgaria's position on the forthcoming 
census in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
-- FYROM]. Bulgaria's representatives at the Council of Europe 
in Strasbourg and at the United Nations and other international 
organizations in Vienna provided similar information to the 
Council of Europe and the Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in Europe (CSCE). 
  The major points of the Bulgarian position, as reported by a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman, are the following: 
  At this stage European standards applied by the Council of 
Europe, the CSCE and other international institutions, 
especially concerning the free expression of national identity, 
are much higher than those operative in Macedonia likely to be 
applied at census; the Government of Macedonia should take the 
necessary steps to secure free expression for all its citizens, 
in line with European standards; Bulgaria will take a stand on 
the results accordingly; Bulgaria attaches great importance to 
relations with Macedonia and is willing to promote them further.

  [Text] Sofia, June 20 (BTA) -- "Ankara has no special 
political or economic strategy about the Turkish minority in 
Bulgaria or in any other Balkan state," says Turkish President 
Suleyman Demirel in his first major interview for the Bulgarian 
press, granted to the editor-in-chief of the TRUD daily Tosho 
Toshev in connection with a forthcoming visit to Turkey by 
Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev. 
  "Turkey's principled position is that people should not be 
forced to leave the country where they were born and have 
lived," the Turkish head of state says. Asked what Turkey had 
done to help the financial development of Bulgaria's 
Muslim-populated borderland areas, he answers that every state 
is obliged to improve the economic conditions of its citizens. 
He expresses the conviction that the economic situation of the 
Bulgarians living in those parts can be improved by expansion of 
trade and economic relations between Bulgaria and Turkey. "To 
this end, the country should discuss ways and means to widen 
trade and economic contacts," Mr. Demirel observes. 
  The Turkish president says that relations between Bulgaria 
and his country have been "good" so far with the exception of 
the 1984-1989 period. He sees the recently growing number of 
high-level visits as a clear indication of the two countries' 
political will to promote their relations in all spheres. 
Bulgarian-Turkish trade has increased considerably, from $60-70 
million in the early 80's to $329 million in 1993, Mr. Demirel 
says. This is an encouraging sign for the tendencies of 
bilateral relations, in his view. 
  The Turkish president describes as "promising" the prospects 
of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Region, recalling that 
Bulgaria and Turkey initiated its establishment. In an area 
overwhelmed by past and present political and economic 
difficulties, regional cooperation can help a lot to overcome 
these difficulties, he emphasizes. "If together with the other 
member countries we manage to do so, we will be able to reap the 
fruits of regional peace and stability," Mr. Demirel notes. 
  Discussing the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, President 
Demirel describes as major progress the Muslim-Croat agreement 
signed in Washington and expresses the opinion that the process 
started with that agreement could provide a sound basis for 
comprehensive peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The economic difficulties experienced by Turkey, the Kurds' 
struggle for independence in Southeastern Turkey and the 
successful performance of Islamic fundamentalists in the local 
elections are also discussed in the interview.

  [Text] Sofia, June 20 (BTA) -- The Union of Democratic 
Forces (SDS) and the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), this 
country's major parliamentary forces, still differ radically 
about the way to go to possible early parliamentary elections, 
according to socialist leader Zhan Videnov, who spoke to the 
press after his meeting with SDS leader Filip Dimitrov. The 
decisions of the two forces' top-level forums about early 
elections this year were discussed at the meeting. 
  The BSP holds that the question about elections should be 
raised in late summer or early in the autumn, when the 
government's term, for which it received a confidence vote, will 
run out, and it will have carried out its programme. For its 
part, the SDS believes the issue should be resolved without 
delay in the coming days and weeks, for which purpose a cabinet 
crisis should be precipitated, followed by the fall of the 
cabinet and elections in October. According to the SDS, the 
Electoral Law and the constitution should be amended only after 
the fall of the cabinet. "We set forth our position, namely, 
that it is difficult to discuss other matters before the 
government's fate is decided," Filip Dimitrov said. The BSP is 
eager to have early elections but not just now, he added. The 
Socialists' suggestion that the preparations for early elections 
should start in the autumn practically amounts to putting them 
off, Dimitrov said. 
  These two approaches are hard to combine. Moreover, the SDS 
links a number of necessary steps, such as amendments to the 
Constitution, debates on a new electoral law or amending the 
effective one, with a guarantee for early elections, which they 
see exclusively in the fall of the government, Videnov 
explained. In his view, this is an extreme, unwise and 
unrealistic approach, to which reality will provide a 
corrective. Videnov believes that given the great difference in 
the views of the two major parliamentary groups, it is doubtful 
whether there will be fast guaranteed progress in a direction 
that would be of benefit to the country above all. 
  The socialist leader presented to Filip Dimitrov an expert 
analysis of the minimum of work needed to be done on the 
Electoral Law. The analysis shows that it could not be done in 
a few days, Zhan Videnov said. 
  Videnov told the press the meeting had been held by mutual 
agreement and had been under preparation for the last three or 
four months. Filip Dimitrov said the invitation to the meeting 
had come from the BSP leadership and the SDS had accepted it. 
It was attended by Ivan Kurtev, chief secretary of the SDS 
National Coordinating Council, and Krasimir Premyanov, Deputy 
Chairman of the BSP Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Report by Ekaterina Kazasova] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, June 17 (BTA) -- "There is every evidence 
that the position of the incumbent Bulgarian Government on human 
rights and the rights of Muslims in Bulgaria in particular is 
the right one," Dr. Ahmad 'Ismat 'Abd al-Majid, secretary 
general of the League of Arab States, told a news conference 
today at the end of his official visit. The visit, paid at the 
invitation of Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov, is 
the first one by a leader of the collective body of the Arab 
states to Bulgaria. During his visit, the guest acquainted 
himself with the Bulgarian Government's positions on the Arab 
region and on a number of international problems. 
  "The problem of Muslims in Bulgaria has been raised at all 
my 
meetings at different levels," Dr. Majid said. "Based on what I 
have been told, I can draw the conclusion that at the moment all 
Bulgarian citizens enjoy equal rights irrespective of their 
religion," he went on to say. Concerning Bulgaria's request for 
assistance in removing the question of Bulgarian Muslims from 
the agenda of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the 
guest promised to inform the organization's leadership about 
everything he had learned in Bulgaria and expressed his hope 
that the request would be met. 
  The possibility of Bulgarian companies taking part in 
building the infrastructure in the region of Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip was also discussed with Dr. Majid. "Bulgaria has 
been maintaining active relations with the Arab countries, it 
has taken part in the building of their infrastructure and I 
think it is perfectly natural for it to take part in the 
construction in that area," Dr. Majid said. 
  Asked about the stand of the League of Arab States on the 
latest developments in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM], Dr. Majid expressed his hope that 
Macedonia would continue to develop normally, avoiding any 
conflicts and bloodshed. "No doubt what is happening in 
Macedonia now has a negative effect on its neighbours, Bulgaria 
included," he stated. 
  Earlier today Dr. Majid was received by President Zhelyu 
Zhelev and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov. He met National 
Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov too. 
  It was stressed at the meeting with President Zhelev that 
Bulgarian-Arab cooperation should be restored and activated. 
"In a historical, geographical and economic aspect, Bulgaria 
has always maintained good contacts with the Arab states," Kamen 
Velichkov, the president's foreign political adviser, said after 
the meeting. 
  The positions of Bulgaria and the Arab League on some major 
issues in the Balkans and the Middle East were clarified at Dr. 
Majid's meeting with the chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament. 
Both sides agreed that Bulgaria would only benefit from the 
quick settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
  Meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Dr. Majid showed interest 
in the difficulties Bulgaria has got to overcome in the 
implementation of economic reform and in its transition to a 
market economy; he was also interested in the progress of 
negotiations on Bulgaria's foreign debt with the international 
financial institutions, government spokesman Raycho Raykov said 
after the meeting. Prime Minister Berov stressed the fact that 
despite the difficulties, Bulgaria's transition to a 
market-based economy is peaceful. The guest wanted to know if 
foreign investments are protected in Bulgaria; he was assured 
that they are and that Bulgarian and foreign investors are 
treated on an equal footing. 
  Dr. Majid visited St. Aleksandur Nevski Cathedral in the 
centre of Sofia. He took a walk round the open market-place in 
the square in front of the cathedral where Bulgarian artists and 
craftsmen sell their works. He seemed to be especially 
interested in Bulgarian crafts and crochetwork. Tomorrow Dr. 
Majid will be visiting the Rila Monastery. He is leaving the 
country on Sunday.

  [Text] Prague, June 17 (CTK) -- A new deputies' bill on 
elections to the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate was 
officially submitted to the parliament today, CTK has learnt. 
The bill was drafted by thirteen deputies from the coalition 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Civic Democratic Alliance 
(ODA), and the Christian Democratic Party (KDS), and from the 
Liberal Social Democratic Party (LSNS). The new bill was 
submitted two weeks after the Chamber failed to pass on June 2 a 
government bill complete with some changes and additions 
proposed by deputies. 
  Elections to the Chamber are to be held in 1996, elections 
to 
the yet unformed Senate were planned for the autumn, along with 
communal elections. But as the law was not passed, the 
Senatorial elections will probably be postponed. 
  The new bill has been drafted on the basis of the original 
government bill, but includes almost all the changes and 
additions proposed by deputies and approved at the parliamentary 
session on June 2. But it does not include the proposal by 
Miloslav Vyborny (coalition Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-CSL) that the first 
Senatorial elections be held in 81 constituencies, but the 
following elections in only 27 constituencies formed by merger 
of the original 81. The Senators' term is to be six years and 
one third of them is to altered every two years. 
  In discussing the government bill the parliament approved 
Vyborny's proposal, which resulted in the bill's rejection 
particularly by ODS deputies. The ODS has resolutely insisted 
on all Senatorial elections to be held in 81 one-mandate 
constituencies for which it has been criticized by both 
coalition and opposition parties. They claim that through this 
the ODS wants to ensure its dominance of the Senate. 
  Marek Benda, chairman of the KDS group, told CTK on June 9 
that the preparation of a new bill "is an expression of our 
effort to pronounce our conviction that the Senate must be 
filled and that it is not possible to pretend as if everything 
was in order after the failure to pass one law. It is simply 
not a correct attitude to say that we will not implement the 
Constitution and will start considering how to re-write it." 
  Since the failure to pass the law, various proposals have 
been made to delete the Senate from the Constitution and to 
divide its powers between the government, parliament, and 
president.

  [Text] Prague/Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- The information 
that the Czech Republic ranks sixth in international trade in 
arms was challenged by Kamil Cermak, press spokesman for the 
Trade and Industry Ministry, today. He called incorrect the 
data by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 
(SIPRI), according to which the Czech Republic had made a profit 
of DM800 million [German marks] from military equipment exports 
last year, the sixth largest in the world. 
  Cermak said that the Ministry had turned to SIPRI to explain 
from where it had drawn the data on Czech arms exports and to 
rectify the matter. He said that in 1993 the Czech Republic had 
exported $167 million worth of weapons. In 1992, the last year 
of the Czechoslovak Federation, the exports amounted to about 
$150 million, particularly thanks to exports of Slovak-made 
tanks and heavy weaponry. 
  About 80 percent of Czech exports is constituted by L-39 
Albatross jet planes made by the Aero company. The rest are 
artillery, hunting, and short fire arms, Cermak said. Czech 
weapons are exported especially to third world countries which 
comply with the legal terms of arms exports. 
  Reacting to the news about the Czech Republic's alleged 
sixth 
position among arms exporters, Eva Slavkovska, deputy chairman 
of the Slovak National Party (SNS), said today that the armament 
industry conversion in Czechoslovakia affected only Slovakia, 
but "came" to the country from the Czech Republic. Because the 
Slovaks had got caught by the Czechs' goal-orientated game, the 
Czech Republic has now been profiting from arms exports, she 
said. 
  Slavkovska pointed out that under the federation, when a 
substantial part of the armament industry was concentrated in 
Slovakia, Czechoslovakia had ranked seventh among world arms 
exporters. The SNS was a coalition partner of the former 
government of Vladimir Meciar.

  [Text] Prague June 18 (CTK) -- The Democratic Union (DEU) 
will seek enactment of the non-proscription of the crimes of 
communism, says a manifesto of the new right-wing party which 
was officially constituted today. The manifesto also calls for 
barring former higher Communist Party officials, agents of the 
secret police (StB) and members of extremist parties and 
movements from civil service. It stresses that "the tyranny of 
the StB minority nomenklatura" had been continuing because no 
essential attempt had been made to settle accounts with the 
totalitarian past. 
  Espousing fundamental liberal democratic values, the DEU 
will 
assert a new concept of politics as an activity which is not 
"dirty," but which will restore people's civic self-confidence 
and interest in commitment in public affairs, the manifesto says. 
  DEU was registered as a political party at the beginning of 
March. The idea to establish a new right-orientated party 
appeared for the first time last September in an article signed 
by Josef Kudlacek, publisher of the right-orientated daily CESKY 
DENIK. In it he criticised the policy of the strongest Czech 
party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) of Premier Vaclav Klaus. 
  Kudlacek then wrote that the creation of the new party was 
"an opportunity for this country, an opportunity to prevent the 
left from seizing power again in the next elections." He also 
said that "unless a new right-orientated party is established, 
our country will be faced with the tragic Polish turnabout." 
  The party today elected Alena Hromadkova its chairwoman. 
Hromadkova, 51, is a sociologist and economist by education. 
She had never been a member of any party. She signed the 
Charta 77 human rights manifesto. She was one of its 
spokeswomen in 1991.

  [Text] Brno, South Moravia, June 18 (CTK) -- A new Moravian 
party, the Movement for Self-Governing Moravia and Silesia 
(HSMS), was established today electing Jan Smejkal its chairman. 
Smejkal told CTK that the priority goal of the HSMS, registered 
on June 1, was self-rule for Moravia. 
  He said that the participants in the constituent congress 
considered the movement a successor organisation to the original 
Self-Governing Democracy Movement for Moravia and Silesia 
(HSDMS) which was transformed into the present Bohemian and 
Moravian Centre Party (CMSS) in January. Some members of the 
original movement, especially those active at Brno's local 
administration, disagreed with the move. 
  Delegates from the Brno organisaton accused CMSS Chairman 
Jan 
Krycer at the CMSS congress on June 4 "of a loss of prestige of 
the party, disintegration of the organisational structure and 
decline in the party's popularity." The CMSS has 9 out of a 
total of 200 parliamentary seats. But according to the latest 
public opinion polls, it would not cross the parliamentary 
border of 5 per cent now.

  [Text] Prague, June 19 (CTK) -- "The Czech Republic has 
refused for the time being to grant a request from the United 
Nations to reinforce the UN forces in Rwanda and send a military 
hospital complete with the staff there," Monday's [20 June] 
issue of the independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES writes. "The 
request was conveyed last week to the Czech delegation to the UN 
and visiting representatives of the parliamentary Defense and 
Security Committee by UN Undersecretary General Kofi Anan," the 
paper writes. 
  "According to diplomatic sources, the Czech UN mission said 
that the Czech Republic would not most likely grant the request 
because it had already exhausted all its possibilities to 
reinforce the peace-keeping forces. 
  "The director of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations 
Section, Jaromir Novotny, had said earlier that the Army did not 
have any more reserves for UN operations. But according to 
Czech Army representatives it would be much more difficult to 
find volunteers ready to go to Rwanda than to provide the 
hospital," the paper says. It recalls that the Czech Republic 
has already sent one field surgical team of 20 doctors to the 
former Yugoslavia. Czech soldiers and civilian policemen of the 
Czech Armed Forces are currently active within five UN 
peace-keeping operations, the paper points out.

  [Text] Budapest, 17 Jun (MTI) -- The Hungarian Socialist 
Party (MSZP) is expected to hold eight ministerial portfolios in 
the new government, with the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) 
heading the remaining 4 ministries, according to the latest news 
of coalition talks. The MSZP won 209 of the total 386 seats in 
the recent elections, while the SZDSZ took 69. 
  It is almost certain that in the coalition, or as the 
parties 
themselves define it, "common government," MSZP President Gyula 
Horn will be appointed prime minister. Gabor Kuncze, SZDSZ 
parliamentary party leader and prime ministerial candidate, will 
fill the newly created post of "coalition deputy prime 
minister." However, according to the Constitution law, it is 
not the coalition deputy prime minister who will replace the 
prime minister in the case of his absence, but the minister of 
finance and economy, Laszlo Bekesi. The new, re-structured 
Ministry of Finance and Economy will have increased 
responsibilities compared to the present Ministry of Finance. 
  The privatisation process may also be managed by Bekesi, 
dubbed the MSZP's "economics guru." Bekesi was responsible for 
the party's economic manifesto and was finance minister in the 
Nemeth government of 1988-89. 
  Of the ministries, Gabor Kuncze is likely to head the 
Ministry of Interior, and another SZDSZ member, Gabor Fodor, the 
Ministry of Culture and Education. 
  A Socialist politician is expected to head the Ministry of 
Labour. The Ministry of International Economic Relations will 
be integrated with the Ministry of Industry and Trade, where the 
minister is expected to be Socialist politician Laszlo Pal. His 
name has also been mentioned as the possible head of a unified 
State Property Agency (SPA)-State Holding Company (AV Rt). 
  An SZDSZ politician is expected to head the Ministry of 
Infrastructure, which will be formed from the Ministry of 
Transport, Telecommunications and Water Management. The 
minister of justice is also expected to be appointed from the 
SZDSZ, although according to some sources the SZDSZ is seeking 
to exchange this portfolio for the Speaker of Parliament. The 
Socialists' candidate for speaker is Zoltan Gal. If he is 
appointed, then the deputy speaker(s) may be Alajos Dornbach 
from the SZDSZ, and/or Peter Boross, the outgoing prime 
minister. Since the SZDSZ has refused the defence portfolio 
offered by the Socialists, this position is also expected to be 
filled by the MSZP. 
  Pal Kovacs and Laszlo Kovacs, both MSZP, are expected to 
head 
the Ministry of Welfare and the Foreign Ministry repectively. 
The minister of agriculture is also expected to be an MSZP 
politician, Laszlo Lakos. 
  Two candidates, Gyorgy Keleti (MSZP) and Imre Mecs (SZDSZ) 
are running for the post of the minister of defence. The head 
of the environmental protection portfolio is expected to be 
former Expo commissioner Etele Barath. 
  The number of ministers without portfolio is expected to be 
reduced to 1 or 2, and the present internal structure of the 
ministries maintained. The arrangement of public administration 
state secretaries, who organise political and professional 
activities of the ministries, will also remain. However, the 
state secretary positions remain an area of dispute, the 
question being whether or not the secretary should be from the 
same party as the minister.

  [Text] Budapest, 20 June (MTI) -- A preliminary agreement 
on the distribution of ministerial portfolios was reached during 
Monday's [20 June] round of coalition talks between the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto announced today.

the 
interior, as well as the transport, telecommunications, water 
management, and education ministers. The rest of the portfolios 
will be held by Socialist politicians.

Democrats will head three parliamentary committees: the 
constitutional, the defense, and the foreign affairs 
committee.The rest of the non-opposition committees will be 
chaired by Socialists. 
  According to an earlier decision, about one third of 
parliamentary committees will be chaired by opposition parties.

  [Text] Wroclaw, June 18 -- President Lech Walesa on 
Saturday told a news conference in Wroclaw that defence is the 
pillar of the state while last four years have not been fully 
used by politicians to build a strong and effective defence 
system in Poland. He vowed that acting on advice of the General 
Staff he will veto the 1995 Budget Law if it does not allocate 
more funds for the Defence Ministry. 
  Earlier in the day, the president who is also the superior 
of 
the armed forces attended a ceremony of promoting the graduates 
of Wroclaw's Tadeusz Kosciuszko Officers' College to the rank of 
second lieutenant. The promotion was carried out by chief of 
the army's General Staff General Tadeusz Wilecki. 
  Congratulating the newly-promoted 241 graduates, Walesa said 
the homeland will never dissapoint them and added he will do his 
best to improve the army's bad financial situation, claiming 
that one mustn't "economize on the army." 
  Asked by journalists about the forthcoming visit of the U.S. 
President to Poland, Walesa vowed to tell Bill Clinton that 
Poland wants to rapidly and strongly integrate economically and 
militarily with Europe. He said he will stress that it is in 
the the United States's interest that Europe is included within 
one security system. 
  Walesa touched upon the 1995 presidential elections and told 
newsmen that he will conduct his next presidential campaign in a 
way that is different from what journalists and politicians 
"imagine and contrive." The president stated he wants to be 
re-elected because he has not completed his work and built 
democracy in Poland. The promotion ceremonies were also held in 
Poznan, Deblin, Koszalin, Jelenia Gora, Zegrze and Torun, with 
the presidential chancellery ministers attending. 
  Also on Saturday, head of the National Security Bureau 
Henryk 
Goryszewski handed a banner to the elite airborne troops of the 
Krakow military district. Defence Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk 
attended the ceremony. A similar event was held in Bydgoszcz 
where a banner was given to an air defence unit by secretary of 
state at the presidential chancellery, minister Mieczyslaw 
Wachowski. A mass was later said by the Polish Army's Field 
Bishop Leszek Slawoj Glodz.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 20 -- The Democratic Left Alliance 
(SLD) won Sunday's local elections in most cities, according to 
preliminary results collected by the Polish press agency PAP. 
The SLD won most local council seats in 17 provincial capitals: 
Lodz, Kalisz, Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Radom, Kielce, Szczecin, 
Koszalin, Slupsk, Bydgoszcz, Suwalki, Ciechanow, Zielona Gora, 
Plock, Ostroleka, Legnica, and Sieradz. Centre-right coalitions 
won in Bialystok, Lomza, Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin, 
while the Freedom Union and related coalitions came first in 
Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Wroclaw, Krakow and Bielsko-Biala. The 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) won single seats in several cities 
but it is expected to win more seats in the countryside. 
By-elections to the Senate brought victory to candidates of the 
SLD and PSL. The election turnout has been estimated at 35.8 per 
cent, head of the State Electoral Commission Wojciech Laczkowski 
announced. This estimate is based on data from 36 provinces. 
Official results are expected at the end of this week. 
  The turnout was higher in the countryside (38.5 per cent) 
than in towns (29.2 per cent). The highest turnout was recorded 
in the Leszno and Poznan Provinces, 43 and 42 per cent 
respectively. The lowest turnout occurred in Lomza (23 per 
cent) and Gorzow (24 per cent). "Low turnout does not mean a 
crisis of the local government idea. A conflict with a village 
head may be a reason for people not to go to the polls. At the 
same time, turnout may be very high in a neighbouring commune," 
said head of the National Election Bureau Kazimierz Czaplicki. 
Czaplicki added said that the 36 per cent turnout was low but 
not discrediting. He said that local elections in other 
countries often attract moderate attention among the electorate, 
for example, 25 per cent in the United States, 39 in Hungary, 
and 40 in Britain. 
  Secretary-general of the Social Democracy of the Republic of 
Poland (SDRP) Jerzy Szmajdzinski told Mondays press conference 
that according to the estimates of the SLD it has increased ten 
times the number of local council members. He contended the 
result was satisfactory, which indicates that the SLD was the 
main leftist force. He said that the election results mean that 
society favours the implementation of a normal political 
timetable, with no accelerations. In Szmajdzinski's opinion, the 
SLD won 30 per cent of votes in 29 cities, following up their 
September 19 parliamentary election result.

    [Editorial Report] Warsaw PAP in English at 0737 GMT on 20 
June carries a series of several short reports on results of the 
Polish local elections on 19 June. The following is a 
compilation of the reports: 
  According to the electoral commission in Lodz, candidates of 
the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] won 36 mandates out of 80 to 
the Lodz municipal council. The Lodz Alliance of Citizens, 
comprising the Christian-National Union, the Peasant Agreement, 
the National Party, and the Party of Christian Democrats, won 23 
seats. The turnout in Lodz reached some 25 percent. 
  In Kalisz, the electoral forum of the left wing won 18 
mandates to the 45-seat municipal council, according to the 
local electoral commission. The Freedom Union managed to win 
eight seats, and the Polish Peasant Party two mandates.

  In Szczecin, the BBWR socio-political association filed an

Poland. The center-right coalitions won in Bialystok, Lomza, 
Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin while the Freedom Union and 
related coalitions came first in Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, and 
Wroclaw. 
  The election turnout was estimated at between 23 and 37

provinces than in their capitals.

expected 
to win more seats in the countryside.

  [Text] Lodz, June 20--The low turnout in Sunday's local 
government elections is a defeat of all political forces in 
Poland, but the greatest defeat was suffered by the church, 
according to deputy head of the Social Democracy of the Republic 
of Poland (SDRP) Leszek Miller. 
  "The church has mobilized all its strength, this time it put 
everything in the balance, (...) but it failed to mobilize such 
masses of voters to go to the ballot box it counted on. I 
believe this is the expression of disagreement of many believers 
to a politicized role the church has recently sought to play in 
Poland," Miller told journalists in Lodz on Monday. 
  Miller thought that the outcome of the elections offers a 
chance for political stability in Poland. It will be possible 
to keep the election and political timetables--presidential 
elections in over a year, next local government elections in 
four years, and parliamentary elections in less than four years. 
He added that the elections must have convinced all politicians 
and all Poles that the "road to a civic society will be arduous, 
difficult and long."

  [Text] Poznan, June 20 -- President Lech Walesa told 
journalists in Poznan on Monday that the local elections held on 
June 19, "although apolitical, will acquire a political 
character when the results are summed up" because parties will 
try to demonstrate how many seats they have won, the president 
said. 
  Lech Walesa also pointed out that Polish economy had changed 
for good and communists who have turned into wealthy capitalists 
will not introduce communism again. According to the president, 
the comeback of the old regime is impossible because "that would 
need Soviet tanks once again." 
  Referring to the question of the freedom of press in Poland, 
the president assessed that Polish press is entangled in party 
alignments and reporters are hunting for sensation. However, he 
added "it is a crisis of adolescence one has to go through and 
things should improve later." 
  Questioned about the arrest of Boguslaw Bagsik, Mr. Walesa 
reiterated that he had expected a just trial of Bagsik, former 
"Art-B" company owner who is charged with pumping huge money out 
of the Polish banks.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 17/6/1994 -- Commenting in a 
press conference on Friday, 17 June, on the letter sent to 
Romanian President Ion Iliescu by the leaders of the opposition 
parliamentary groups on Thursday [16 June], whereby the 
president was being asked to attend the joint session of the two 
chambers of parliament in order to deliver some explanations 
about a recent statement he made, presidency spokesman Traian 
Chebeleu stated: "We are bewildered by the unconstitutional 
character of the means by which the parliamentary groups of the 
opposition are trying to bring the president in front of 
parliament. The president has not been elected by the 
parliament and cannot be summoned to answer for his acts at the 
initiative of several parliamentary groups who have involved 
through this invitation the whole parliament without previously 
consulting the whole parliament." 
  Reiterating the essence of the president's statements made 
during a visit in the country [in Satu Mare] with regard to the 
issue of the nationalized houses, the presidency spokesman said 
that the statements were perfectly legal and in concordance with 
the presidential prerogatives and therefore "the president has 
nothing to retract." 
  The very fact that the president would not follow a 
procedure, considered to be unconstitutional, of coming in front 
of the legislative, does not exclude the president's readiness 
for dialogue with any political formation on the basis of mutual 
respect, said the spokesman. 
  "The president will come in front of parliament any time it 
is necessary, but only if the constitutional provisions are 
observed," said presidency spokesman Traian Chebeleu.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- Slovak Interior 
Minister Ladislav Pittner told CTK today a definitive conclusion 
on the Czech-Slovak border was conditional upon the solution to 
the issue of a small area of Czech weekend cottage owners called 
Kasarna to which Slovakia raises a claim. 
  In an interview for CTK, Pittner said that "the Czech party 
must drop its claim to the Kasarna area in exchange for another 
territory and recognize that for Slovakia the area is important 
and attractive by its character, and that it is not only a 
matter of territorial compensation." 
  Kasarna, now administratively part of north Moravia, has 
been 
an object of discords between the Czechs and Slovaks for several 
centuries. 
  Pittner said that the area was to be discussed by the Czech 
and Slovak premiers, Vaclav Klaus and Jozef Moravcik, when they 
meet within the World Economic Forum which opened in 
Crans-Montana, Switzerland, today. 
  Pittner and his Czech counterpart, Jan Ruml, are to meet on 
the Czech territory next week to discuss some pending questions 
related to the introduction of a standard border regime and some 
technical questions related to the addendum to the Czech-Slovak 
visa-free agreement which specifies certain articles of the 
agreement. The addendum was approved by the Slovak Government 
earlier this week. 
  It is to be signed by the Czech and Slovak foreign 
ministers, 
Josef Zieleniec and Eduard Kukan, at their meeting in Prague on 
Monday [20 June].

  [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government will 
try to settle the property disputes with the Czech Republic 
before the parliamentary elections scheduled for September 
30-October 1, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan told a meeting 
organized by the Bohemiae Foundation today. 
  The so far unresolved property "disputes" make up around two 
and a half per cent of the total bulk of the former federal 
(Czechoslovak) property; they largely pertain to the "Slovak 
gold," Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan 
said. Slovakia has claimed several tonnes of gold amassed by 
the Nazi-sponsored Slovak state during World War Two which was 
confiscated by Czechoslovakia after the war. 
  The meeting of the two countries' premiers which occurred 
this weekend in the Crans-Montana economic forum has contributed 
to the prospective solution of the "feuds", Kukan noted. 
  As there were 70 years of common history, relations between 
the two states, however independent, still form a "special 
category," Czech Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Vondra said. 
As far as the future development of the Czech-Slovak relations 
is concerned, consensus on the "strategic objectives" of the 
foreign policy is necessary, Vondra added. This afternoon Kukan 
will meet Premier Vaclav Klaus and President Vaclav Havel.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic and 
Slovakia have agreed to abolish the old clearing account, 
containing commercial debts which arose before the currency 
separation in February 1993, and have decided that companies 
themselves will cover exchange rate differences that have since 
arisen. 
  "Companies themselves will decide what exchange rate they 
will use to settle their debts on the account. It is untenable 
that differences from changes in the exchange rates be paid from 
the state budget," Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik said on his 
return from the economic forum in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, 
where he also met Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus. 
  The possibility of companies paying the differences, on 
which 
both premiers agreed, is only one option. "Companies can agree 
on compensation through supplies of goods, or each paying half 
the difference," Moravcik said. He admitted that Slovak 
companies would be the losers. 
  The account's abolition must be approved by both countries' 
parliaments. Moravcik said it could take effect as of August 1 
if sufficient legislation is found to serve as a basis for the 
step. He admitted that the account might be abolished after the 
autumn Parliament elections in Slovakia, because in contrast to 
the Slovak Parliament, the Czech one will be holding its last 
session in July. 
  Moravcik said that he considered it important that the Czech 
side had promised it would not "begin any initiative" to abolish 
the mutual clearing account from the customs union. That does 
not mean that mutual payment agreements could not be improved if 
either side wants to change something, he added.

  [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- The present Slovak 
Government will sign a basic treaty with Hungary if it can be 
signed, and will not wait for the autumn parliamentary 
elections, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said today. Speaking 
at a press conference after a meeting with his Czech counterpart 
Josef Zieleniec, Kukan said there existed positive signs that 
the treaty would be concluded. The key points of the treaty are 
recognition of the existing border and guarantees of ethnic 
minorities. 
  The treaty has been under preparation for a long time now, 
but the minority policy of the former government of Vladimir 
Meciar and some stands on the same question of the previous 
Hungarian government had not allowed its signature. "We have 
already been preparing the text of the treaty and I believe that 
talks on it will start immediately after the (new) Hungarian 
government starts functioning," Kukan said. 
  Kukan and Zieleniec today signed an addendum to the October 
29, 1992 Czech-Slovak agreement abolishing the visa duty. The 
addendum brings the border and customs regime on the Czech- 
Slovak border closer to European standards. It allows citizens 
from third countries to cross the Czech-Slovak border at 
specified crossings which is to allow better control of 
migration. Kukan also met today Chairman of the Czech 
parliament Milan Uhde.

  [Text] Prague, June 20 (CTK) -- Although the Egyutteles 
[Coexistence] Movement does not trust the whole government 
coalition, it still wants to go on supporting the government of 
Jozef Moravcik, Miklos Duray, chairman of the Egyutteles 
Movement of ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia, says in an 
interview published by the independent Czech daily MLADA FRONTA 
DNES today. 
  "My mistrust is aimed mainly against the post-communist 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), which from the outside looks like 
being open to ethnic minority demands. But it is just the 
opposite: It is the strong SDL group of deputies which has long 
been blocking the solution of minority questions. I would like 
to point out it is known that the SDL deputies are considering 
post-election cooperation with (ex-Premier Vladimir) Meciar," 
Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES. Meciar's Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, now an opposition entity, 
consistently tops opinion polls. 
  "Of course, we are aware that despite its mistakes, the 
(present) government is a better alternative than Meciar," Duray 
says. "However,... the Egyutteles would like the government to 
arise from the new elections (slated for autumn) to lean more to 
the right, as Hungarians were always able to reach consensus 
with the Slovak right wing," he states. 
  He dismisses the idea that he and Meciar need each other to 
legitimize their political stands. "I do not need Mr. Meciar for 
my political existence.... Mr.Meciar has caused many problems 
to Slovak residents, and as a politician I do not want any 
problems," Duray emphasizes. 
  He says he does not consider himself a radical, but a 
politician not inclining to compromises at the cost of 
principles. 
  To the question of the interviewer whether or not the 
Egyutteles contributed to the tension (between Slovaks and the 
strong Hungarian minority) in south Slovakia, when three of its 
nine deputies recently voted against the "place-name" bill 
(which was to enable bilingual place names in the above 
regions), Duray says the rejected bill's wording was far from 
what the ethnic Hungarian parties agreed with the government 
coalition. The bill could also have been passed if it were not 
for the absence of thirteen coalition deputies at the relevant 
parliamentary session, he adds. 
  "We have very precise information that the Council of Europe 
(CE) was attentively monitoring developments in Slovakia and the 
country's attitude to the ethnic minority question," Duray says. 
He points out that the CE had not been correctly informed about 
the "place name" bill. According to him, CE representatives had 
believed that the Slovak Parliament would pass the law in a form 
known from Norway or southern Tyrol. "They did not know at all 
that we (ethnic Hungarians in Slovakia) had given up our claim 
for bilingual names of towns and villages, and accepted -- 
within a compromise -- the introduction of bilingual road signs. 
But this is a fundamental difference, and if they (the CE) had 
known this, the opinion could not arise that Slovak Hungarians 
demanded what could not be fulfilled. Therefore I cannot but 
state that Slovak representatives in the CE had distorted the 
reality at last," Duray says in MLADA FRONTA DNES. 
  Referring to the question of a Hungarian-Slovak agreement to 
grant the unalterability of the common border, Duray says: "I do 
not think at all that the question is of any great political or 
international importance. The border, as all borders in Europe, 
has been guaranteed since the end of World War Two. There is 
only one exception, that of the former Yugoslavia, where we are 
witness to a bloody war, which in no case threatens between 
Slovakia and Hungary. After the split of the Czechoslovak 
Federation (on January 1, 1993) both Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic are in the position of successor states, which also 
means their borders are guaranteed," Duray points out. 
  The Egyutteles Movement has 9 deputies in the 150-seat 
Slovak 
Parliament. Neither it nor the other ethnic Hungarian 
parliamentary party, the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement 
(MKDH, 5 deputies) are members of the government coalition, but 
they are supporting the present government.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 19 (CTK) -- The national council of 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) told CTK 
today it agreed with the formation of a coalition with the 
Egyutteles movement, but still supported the idea of creating a 
coalition of three along with the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS). 
In its statement adopted yesterday and given to CTK today, the 
MKDH said it had confirmed the powers of a commission to 
represent it in talks on the coalition of three. 
  The MKDH and Egyutteles have a total of 14 out of a total of 
150 parliamentary seats. The MOS is an extra-parliamentary 
party. Early parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place 
on September 30-October 1. About 560,000 (11 per cent of 
Slovakia's population) ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia. 
  The idea to form a coalition of three, which is promoted 
particularly by the MKDH, has not met with much support from 
Egyutteles, which would prefer a coalition of four, including 
the Hungarian People's Party (MLS, extra-parliamentary). But 
with the elections drawing near, the movement is ready to 
discuss the "close coalition." 
  Miklos Duray, Egyutteles chairman, told CTK recently that 
the 
"fundamental conditions" for the formation of such a Hungarian 
parties' coalition are: creation of a joint group once they are 
represented in parliament, common policy in local elections 
along with common slates in mayoral elections, and a common line 
on Slovakia's foreign policy. 
  According to a June poll carried out by the Statistical 
Office, the present MKDH-Egyutteles coalition would be supported 
by 8 per cent of voters. The parliamentary border is 5 per cent.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- A visit by Chairman of 
the Russian Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Vladimir Zhirinovskiy 
to Slovakia, which was to have taken place this weekend, was 
postponed indefinitely, one of Zhirinovskiy's private hosts 
lawyer Jozef Lauko told CTK today. 
  "As we have been informed by the LDP leadership, 
Zhirinovskiy's visit will not take place due to foreign and 
internal political developments in Russia," Lauko said citing a 
fax he had received from Andrei Losev, head of the office of the 
LDP deputies' group in the State Duma, the low chamber of the 
Russian parliament. He said, however, he was convinced that 
Zhirinovskiy would in the long run come to Bratislava on a 
suitable date. 
  Zhirinovskiy and four other members of the leadership of the 
ultra-nationalist LDP were to have come to Slovakia for a 
four-day visit on June 25. Zhirinovskiy already planned to 
visit Slovakia already in May but the visit was canceled due to 
a corruption scandal which erupted in the Russian parliament 
then.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- Cabinet today approved 
an amendment to state budget legislation which maintains the 
deficit at 14 billion Slovak crowns (about $424 million), while 
increasing revenues and expenditures, Deputy Premier Brigita 
Schmognerova announced after an extraordinary cabinet meeting 
today. The draft state budget does not resolve the relationship 
between the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of 
Slovakia which must finance the budget deficit. 
  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that he would discuss 
the 
issue with the bank's governor Vladimir Masar. An amendment to 
the Law on the Central Bank will then be drawn up in July, which 
will probably increase the payments that the bank has to make to 
the state budget. Last year, the bank financed a 23 billion 
crown deficit and the state had to pay 9.6 billion crowns in 
interest. The bank only made budget contributions of six billion 
crowns. 
  The amendment increases health expenditures by 1.8 billion 
and education by 1.2 billion crowns. Costs for family benefits 
will also be higher. The government also proposes the creation 
of a reserve for guarantees for social insurance funds. It 
wants to ensure higher revenues through already prepared 
increases in value-added and excise taxes. "If the parliament 
fails to approve the tax laws, the government will withdraw the 
draft amendment on the state budget," Schmognerova remarked. 
  The amendment also allocates 500 million crowns from the 
National Property Fund for comprehensive housing construction 
and 245.5 million crowns for projects converting arms production 
to civilian purposes, which should already have been financed 
last year. A total of 3.5 billion crowns from the Fund's money 
is to be spent on other development programs. 
  Filkus said the draft amendment is conditional on the Slovak 
Government's obligations to the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF).

  [Text] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Premier 
Brigita Schmognerova today rejected opposition claims that the 
government was capitulating before the restrictive policy 
demands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
  "It is easy to accuse somebody but hard to argue," she said 
at a press conference. She refuted the opposition claims by 
citing from documents showing the former government led by 
Vladimir Meciar was planning -- shortly before being ousted by a 
no-confidence vote in March -- to introduce a 20 per cent rise 
in the price of energy and increase the pension age to 65 for 
both men and women. The measures would meet the conditions 
required to qualify for an IMF loan. 
  Meciar said at Jedlove Kostolany, west Slovakia, on Friday 
[17 June] that it was inhuman to send 65-year-olds into 
retirement when the average life expectancy for Slovak men was 
67. 
  At the same meeting Sergej Kozlik, deputy premier in the 
Meciar government, compared the commitments given to the IMF by 
the present government of Jozef Moravcik to a cowpat in a field: 
one person stops before it, the other treads in it. "Whose 
boots are going to stink now? The Moravcik government's!" 
Kozlik said.

  [Text] Zemplinska Sirava, East Slovakia, June 18 (CTK) -- 
The coalition National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS) of 
Ludovit Cernak will run in autumn elections on the slate of 
Premier Jozef Moravcik's Democratic Union (DU), Cernak told CTK 
today. The decision was made at today's meeting of the NDS 
Central Council. Cernak had been chairman of the nationalist 
Slovak National Party (SNS), from which he was expelled in 
February "for consistent gross violation of the statutes." 
  Cernak said that the offers made to his party by the DU and 
the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan Carnogursky were 
equal. The NDS has opted for Moravcik's party because the DU's 
major priority is the creation of a centre bloc, he added. The 
KDH is clearly right-orientated. 
  Another reason were, Cernak said, the results of public 
opinion polls which had shown that the membership and voters of 
the two parties were "compatible." According to the latest 
poll, the DU has a 6 per cent voter support, while the NDS would 
not cross the 5-per cent parliamentary border. 
  Cernak said that the final decision on the participation of 
his party on the DU slate would be made by the DU National 
Council next week. The elections are scheduled to take place on 
September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Jedlove Kostolany, west Slovakia, June 17 (CTK) -- A 
coalition agreement on election cooperation was signed by the 
chairmen of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and 
the Slovak Farmers' Party (RSS), Vladimir Meciar and Pavel 
Delinga, today. 
  The agreement provides for nine RSS representatives to be 
placed on the HZDS list of candidates. The two parties have 
agreed to form a joint deputies' group in the new parliament, 
Meciar reported. The elections are scheduled for September 
30-October 1. 
  First and foremost, it is necessary to ensure that the 
elections are held, Meciar said. After them, Meciar wants to 
acquire such a position which would make it possible for him to 
undertake fundamental changes in the Constitution and economic 
structure of society, he said without specifying. According to 
the latest polls, the HZDS would reap 29 percent of votes, thus 
leading popularity ratings.

percent, while 10 percent of voters have not made up their mind.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 17 (CTK) -- The coalition parties 
agreed today to present the "signpost" law to the next session 
of the Slovak Parliament at the turn of July, chairman of the 
Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) Jan Carnogursky told 
journalists after a session of the coalition parties today. 
  The law on bilingual names for towns and villages inhabited 
by ethnic minorities will be discussed for the third time this 
year. The bill, which pertains mostly to the 560,000-strong 
ethnic Hungarians, has been twice rejected. 
  "The law will make it possible for the towns and villages 
with at least 20 percent of ethnic population to have their 
place names also in the ethnic language, while a list of the 
eligible communities will be a part of the law," Carnogursky 
reported. 
  The list will not include 13 cities bearing the names of 
Slovak cultural personalities (during the previous voting, this 
was the reason for some ethnic Hungarian deputies to vote 
against the law). This time the Hungarian leaders did not insist 
on them and promised to support the bill. The law will also bar 
the names from the era of Magyarization and Horthyite occupation 
(1938-1945), Carnogursky added. 
  According to the deputy chairman of the coalition Democratic 
Left Party (SDL), Milan Ftacnik, the law assumes that change be 
made on the strength of a local referendum for which a 
80-percent turnout will be necessary. The present (Slovak) 
place names will be still exclusively used in official contact, 
while that in ethnic language will be applied only for traffic 
signposts, he explained.

public actions, and in most cases sanctioned by the Serb laws, 
such as the Law on Kosova's Colonization, and on Banning the

  Demaci also familiarized the CSCE delegation with the daily

and wounding them without any cause.

humanitarian association of Pristina refuted Serbian claims that 
"Arms have been dispatched" to its address. The deputy chairman 
of this association, Jak Mita, stated that "No such shipments 
have been sent to us as Serbian television and the newspaper 
POLITIKA say to our address." 
  He stressed that "The donator they refer to is unknown to us 
and that there are no facts in border points of Hungary proving 
these shipments as the Serbian mass media reports," Mr. Mita 
said adding that even the ecumenic community has refuted this 
accusation. It has stressed that the community has received 30 
tonnes of clothes which can be testified to by Engel Ferdi, the 
transporter of the contingent. 
  Serbian information sources said recently that Novi Sad 
customs officials found a truck, during a check of 3 trucks with 
humanitarian aid, "Filled with weapons and military equipment 
weighing up to 10 tonnes." According to the Serbian mass media, 
which refer to customs officials, the trucks had been sent by 
the ecumenic humanitarian service of Hungary for the "Mother 
Teresa" humanitarian organization of the Albanians in Pristina.

  [Text] Pozsony [Bratislava] -- Vladimir Zhirnovskiy, 
chairman of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, will not be 
visiting Slovakia this weekend after all. According to 
information received by the Slovak press, the reason for the 
cancellation of what had been scheduled originally as "a 
friendly tourist visit" was the situation that had developed in 
Russia. Zhirnovskiy and his associates regard that situation as 
too dangerous for the party leader to be absent for four or five 
days abroad. 
  Meanwhile, very significant confidence-building documents 
have been produced at the expert level, as a result of which a 
Deportation Treaty will be signed between Hungary and Slovakia 
in May (or at least the Slovak side so expects), and at least 
one border-crossing point will be opened. It has not yet been 
decided which of the three border-crossing points will be the 
one to be opened while the Boross government is still in office, 
but the signing of the Deportation Treaty has been decided, at 
least by the Slovak side. 
  A dispute arose between the two countries due to Slovakia's 
other deportation treaties, because they anticipated that 
Hungary would become the "reception center" for refugees. As a 
result of talks between experts, held in Budapest on 11 May, the 
contracting parties agreed to take back their own citizens in 
the normal way and to classify arrivals from third countries 
into three categories. It was already indisputable earlier that 
when citizens of a third country held residence permits or 
visas, the contracting parties were willing to proceed in 
accordance with international norms. In the case of persons 
staying illegally in the other country's territory, a refugee 
from a third country will be accepted back within 48 hours, even 
it can be proved that he had arrived from the contracting 
party's country, where he had likewise been staying illegally. 
This provision of the treaty goes beyond the customary treaties 
and presupposes an agreement that suggests good relations 
between the two countries. In the Slovak side's opinion, it is 
not necessary to wait with the signing of the treaty until a new 
government has been formed. That would be an unnecessary delay 
during the summer tourist season.

<F P=106> [Interview with Janos Nemeth, chairman of the National </F>
Election Commission, by Gy. Attila Fekete; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] In an interview with NEPSZABADSAG, Dr. Janos 
Nemeth, chairman of the National Election Commission (OVB), has 
said that the political parties and their candidates, as well as 
independent candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks 
between the two rounds of voting to introduce themselves to the 
voters and outline their programs to them in detail, instead of 
switching to a dirty campaign. According to the OVB chairman, 
the role of the electronic media in the campaign has risen since 
1990. This explains in part the fact that the number of filed 
objections to the programs of Hungarian Television, for 
instance, has multiplied in comparison with the number filed 
four years ago. 
  [Fekete] In recent weeks the Supreme Court has reviewed on 
appeal several opinions of the OVB. At first the court set 
narrowly, and then ever wider, the limits within which the OVB 
could condemn violations. Would it not be more expedient if the 
OVB could issue not just opinions but also binding orders? 
  [Nemeth] With due consideration for the provisions of the 
law 
and the decisions of the Supreme Court, since its establishment 
the OVB has been seeking the legal instruments and other means 
through which it could express its opinion of conduct described 
or presented in various petitions. I know this is difficult to 
understand for persons whose background does not include legal 
training. The law assigned the OVB the task of safeguarding the 
fairness and legality of elections. At the same time, the 
legislators failed to give the OVB suitable instruments with 
which to enforce the Electoral Law. According to my experience, 
however, the very fact that the OVB's proceedings on every 
petition are open to the press, and that its opinions regularly 
receive full coverage in the press and on radio and television, 
is sufficient to deter violators from continuing to break the 
rules. 
  [Fekete] What happens when violators disregard the opinion 
of 
the OVB? Those who attempted to buy nomination forms have been 
arrested. 
  [Nemeth] Section 34, Paragraph 2 of the Electoral Law 
defines 
the jurisdiction of the OVB in specific cases. There you do not 
find any provision that would enable the OVB to penalize conduct 
aimed at "gaining an unlawful advantage," for instance. That, 
too, explains why we have never claimed that the Electoral Law, 
which is rather sketchy on procedure, is our very best piece of 
legislation. 
  [Fekete] You were OVB chairman also during the 1990 
elections. In what respects are the 1990 campaign and the 
present one similar, and how do they differ? 
  [Nemeth] Four years ago the political parties had 
substantially less money for campaigning. This is evident also 
from the substantial increase in political advertisements in 
public places, in the press, and also on radio and television. 
In comparison with the 1990 campaign, the role of the electronic 
media has risen. It is no accident that the OVB has received 
substantially more complaints, objections, and notifications 
concerning Hungarian Radio and especially Hungarian Television. 
  [Fekete] What objections did the notifications contain? 
  [Nemeth] One group of notifications protested that Hungarian 
Television had refused to broadcast one or another political 
party's election program. But another group of notifications was 
not critical specifically of the election programs. In 
conjunction with the increased number of complaints against 
Hungarian Television, however, one must also realize that the 
country itself has become more politicized. People very often 
believe to perceive political overtones even in programs that 
have no political message whatever. On the whole, it seems to 
me, there was less rudeness in this election campaign than had 
been expected. 
  [Fekete] But most of the complaints critical of Hungarian 
Television's programs must have had some foundation. After all, 
the OVB recently called on Hungarian Television, Hungarian 
Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency to observe the provisions 
of the Electoral Law, and it warned them that the principles of 
fairness and impartiality must not be violated even in programs 
not related to the elections. Could you explain this somewhat 
Dodonian opinion? 
  [Nemeth] The Electoral Law specifies what the public service 
media are required to do during an election campaign, what kind 
of programs and announcements they are obliged to broadcast. 
Except in the case of election programs, however, the law 
contains no provisions regarding the conduct of Hungarian 
Television, Hungarian Radio, and the Hungarian News Agency. We 
drafted our exhortative opinion, for impartiality and fairness 
in the elections, on the basis of Section 26 of the Electoral 
Law. 
  [Fekete] For Hungarian Television, what would be the 
consequences of failure to change its programming policies, 
despite the OVB's warning? 
  [Nemeth] The OVB has no authority to impose a penalty on 
Hungarian Television. Should Hungarian Television's programs 
fail to conform to the OVB's opinion in the future as well, the 
political parties or voters could claim a violation. 
  [Fekete] Four years ago the campaign really degenerated only 
in the second round. 
  [Nemeth] I sincerely hope that will not be the case in 1994. 
The parties and their candidates, as well as independent 
candidates, would be wise to use the three weeks between the two 
rounds of voting to outline their programs in greater detail 
instead of discrediting each other. The voters will punish any 
candidate who conducts a dirty campaign. 
  [Fekete] Much of the time during the OVB's sessions is spent 
arguing whether the question that happens to be on the agenda is 
or is not within the commission's jurisdiction. Why is that? 
  [Nemeth] It would be unfair of me to blame everything on the 
Electoral Law's shortcomings. Parliament elected four members 
and the secretary of the OVB, and 15 members have been delegated 
by political parties running national lists. Some of the 
disputes stem from the political parties' contrasting interests. 
Naturally, it would be better if the OVB were following legally 
correct rules of procedure--say, rules contained in the 
Electoral Law itself. 
  [Fekete] Has it never occurred to the OVB to propose 
amending 
the Electoral Law and to draft a bill on electoral procedures? 
After all, the Electoral Law now in force has simply proved to 
be bad. 
  [Nemeth] I am unable to fully agree with your last comment. 
In my opinion, the Electoral Law's substantive provisions are 
not bad. It is the law's procedural part that has been left 
unfinished and is causing countless problems. The OVB does not 
have authority to draft legislative bills, and no one has 
requested it to do so. Of course, if the Interior Ministry or 
the Justice Ministry were to begin work on amending or further 
amending the new or amended Electoral Law, the OVB would gladly 
share its experience with the authorities concerned.

<F P=106> [Article by Gy. Attila Fekete: "It Was an Accident, </F>
According to the Police"] 
  [Text] Police Lieutenant General Sandor Pinter, national 
police commissioner, announced at his news conference that Gyula 
Horn, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, suffered a 
traffic accident on 5 May, between Nyekladhaza and Emod on 
Highway 3. The police investigation has been unable to confirm 
rumors of foul play. After the news conference the defense 
attorney for Horn's driver said that the police had not ruled 
out foul play definitely. 
  As we have reported several times earlier, a Saab 9000 car 
(registration number DFG-070) transporting Gyula Horn from 
Miskolc to Budapest collided with a disabled IFA 
[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau] truck that was parked in the left 
lane of the 159.7-km section of Highway 3, between Nyekladhaza 
and Emod. The occupants of the Saab were: Gyula Horn, chairman 
of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party]; his driver Istvan 
Mosolygo; and Horn's bodyguard, retired Police Major Jeno 
Zsidei. All three suffered serious, but not life-threatening, 
injuries. 
  According to the official police report on the inspection of 
the scene of the accident, the disabled IFA truck had been 
parked in the left lane--relative to the direction in which 
Horn's car was heading--between 0.7 and 1.2 meters from the 
road's center line. 
  In his statement to the police, the truck driver said he had 
not parked at the side of the road to change tires because the 
truck was hauling 80 quintals of canned food, and he was afraid 
that the vehicle might overturn. In addition, it would not have 
been possible to change tires on the road's soft shoulder. The 
technical experts confirmed the truck driver's arguments. They 
established that the truck did have a flat tire. In other words, 
the truck had not been positioned there intentionally for the 
subsequent accident. The tire on the right rear wheel of the 
truck's trailer had a 46-cm rip that had been caused by fatigue. 
By the weak light of a flashlight, the truck driver was just 
loosening the nuts on the wheel when the Saab crashed into the 
truck. 
  Two technical experts presented their findings at the news 
conference. They had established beforehand, in agreement with 
the Saab factory's experts, that the structural deformations of 
the car's body and frame indicated an absorption of kinetic 
energy equal to the energy generated by the car at a speed of 55 
to 60 km per hour [kph], which in practice means that the damage 
was what would have occurred had Horn's car crashed into a 
concrete wall at a speed of 55 to 60 kph. 
  Of course, the truck's body likewise suffered serious damage 
in the accident, and the Saab's kinetic energy slowed down 
significantly also during the breakup of the truck's body. After 
impact, the car kept skidding for about 40 meters and then 
stopped. Technical expert Gabor Meleg concluded from all this 
that, at the time of impact, the car's speed must have been 
between 98 and 102 kph. Laszlo Vincze, the other expert, 
estimates that the car's speed must have been between 85 and 109 
kph. The car was equipped with an automatic braking system; 
therefore it was impossible to determine at what speed the car 
had been traveling before impact, and whether and when the 
brakes had been applied before impact. However, reconstruction 
of the accident on a computer excludes the possibility that the 
Saab might have been traveling substantially faster than 100 
kph. At a speed of 140 kph, the car would have landed in the 
ditch on the right side of the highway, relative to the 
direction in which it was heading. The investigation determined 
that the Saab had just been returning from the left lane when a 
third of its front end crashed into the truck. The police were 
unable to explain why the Saab had been in the left lane. The 
highway along the given section was straight, and the 
possibility of drifting was ruled out. The police likewise found 
no clue indicating that somebody on the side of the road might 
have startled the car's driver, and that might have been the 
reason why he wrenched the steering wheel to the left and 
crashed the car. The police established that the flashes of 
light Jeno Zsidei mentioned in his statement may probably have 
been the glittering street lights in Emod. 
  The defense attorney for Istvan Mosolygo, who in the 
meantime 
has become a defendant, attended the news conference and 
listened to the reports. Afterwards, with Police Lt. General 
Pinter's consent, he outlined the line of defense his client 
would offer. The gist of it is that from the very beginning the 
police had regarded the crash as an accident and had not 
investigated the possibility of foul play. 
  The police have recommended that the public prosecutor 
charge 
Mosolygo with causing a traffic accident through negligence. At 
the end of the news conference, Sandor Pinter announced that, 
until the end of the second round in the elections, he would 
maintain his offer to provide a Mercedes--complete with 
communications equipment, a driver and a bodyguard--for each 
major political party, upon their request.

  [Text] "We would be immediately in favor of having 
the Serbs in Croatia given as many rights as the Albanians have 
in Kosovo," Tudjman says, stating that Milosevic made a 
statement along those lines in the Greek KATIMERINI. 
  Zagreb, 28 May--Just before Croatian Statehood Day (30 May, 
when the Assembly was constituted in 1990 after the first 
postwar multiparty elections), Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
spoke with the chief editors of the Croatian media, and long 
extracts from this were published in today's newspapers. 
  On that occasion Tudjman mostly repeated his already 
well-known ideas about events in the last three years--about 
"the Yugocommunist army's offensive to overthrow the Croatian 
authorities, and not just to conquer Croatian areas as a 
whole"--but some of his statements in connection with solving 
the Serbian question in Croatia are interesting, in view of the 
topicality of the subject. 
  Stating that "a trip to Belgrade by our foreign minister had 
been agreed upon, but our condition for that was that it could 
take place when the route to Belgrade was normalized, i.e., 
through Okucani and by telephone," Tudjman, among other things, 
said the following: 
  "The world does not accept that the Serbs in Croatia have 
the 
right to self-determination, which they and their politicians 
and intellectuals are citing. The Serbs are a minority in 
Croatia, we have guaranteed them all the rights of an ethnic 
community, and we are even willing to give them territorial 
self-government in districts, the two districts where they had a 
majority even before the war, cultural autonomy within Croatia 
as a whole...." 
  Saying that "They (the Serbs) are still spreading all sorts 
of deceptions about the emergence of the NDH [Independent State 
of Croatia]," Tudjman said that Croatia was willing "for the 
exercise of those rights to be under the supervision of the 
international community." 
  "In discussions of the Serbian question in Croatia, people 
are still bringing up the NDH, with those awful figures that at 
least 600,000 to 700,000 Serbs were killed in Jasenovac alone. 
But the total number of people who died in all of Yugoslavia 
during World War II was not that high," Tudjman also claimed, 
commenting that "back in the 1950's, i.e., in Belgrade, I 
rebelled against those lies." He claimed that "600,000 people 
did not die in all of Yugoslavia during World War II, counting 
all the partisan, chetnik, ustashe, Home Guard losses, with all 
the Jasenovac, Bleiburg losses, and so forth," but that instead 
"The war losses were 597,000." 
  "Back when I wrote `Wilderness' ["Wilderness of Historical 
Reality"], I did not have that fact. Go to the public, and give 
them those facts in all the newspapers, in order to destroy that 
rumor and deception, because that is the basis for the alleged 
justification for the Serbian demands, fear, deception, and so 
forth," Tudjman commented, and so it turns out that what the 
ustashe did to the Serbs is not any sort of reason for fear, 
even though it is a fact that their goal and intention was the 
biological extermination of the Serbian people from the 
territory of the Quisling NDH. 
  In connection with possible trips to try to solve the 
Serbian 
question in Croatia, Tudjman continued by saying this: 
  "In contrast to the Martic-Mikelic tension and irrational 
behavior, there is a statement by Milosevic in the Athens 
KATIMERINI, where he said regarding a solution that the problem 
of the Serbs in Croatia should be solved in the same way as the 
problem of the Albanians in Kosovo. That is the most positive 
thing that has been publicly stated to date. Of course we would 
be immediately in favor of having the Serbs in Croatia given as 
many rights as the Albanians have in Kosovo."

  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies, whose 18th session is to 
resume on Thursday, today adopted a law on postal services and 
telecommunications. It postponed the adoption of amendments to 
the law on the sale of apartments under tenancy agreements until 
there has been a revision of the use of all so-called army 
apartments. The chamber decided to call an extraordinary session 
in July, at which an answer will be formulated on whether the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] mandate should be extended. It 
was suggested that the state president be invited to this 
session. 
  The decision to convene a session in July was adopted 
following a debate on a resolution condemning the genocide in 
the form of large-scale terror and violence being perpetrated by 
the occupying Serbian authorities as they deny water supplies to 
Biograd, Zadar, and its environs. 
  The resolution -- which will be sent to the parliaments of 
European countries and those of the members of the UN Security 
Council, the UN secretary general, and the International War 
Crimes Tribunal -- will remind the international public of the 
genocide perpetrated against the Croatian people, and inform it 
about the situation in Biograd and its environs as they cannot 
get water from an area belonging to Biograd, although it is 
under exclusive UNPROFOR control. 
  UNPROFOR's indecisiveness and its soft approach to the 
Serbian terrorists is ever more irritating for the 30,000 people 
of Biograd and its 10,000 refugees, who have for three years now 
been suffering an unbearable shortage of water. Hence, the 
resolution stresses, there is a possibility of the local 
population demonstrating openly their dissatisfaction at 
UNPROFOR's inefficiency. The assembly demands that the Croatian 
Government adopt energetic steps to curb further Serbian 
terrorism against the people of Biograd, Zadar, and its 
environs, and that it demand the consistent implementation of 
all UN Security Council resolutions and the Zagreb agreement.

<F P=106> [HINA report: "Croatia Is Carrying Out Large-Scale Reforms"] </F>
  [Text] Crans Montana -- Croatia presented itself in the 
plenary session of the economic meeting "Forum Universale" on 
Saturday [18 June]. Nikica Valentic, the prime minister, and 
Mate Granic and Borislav Skegro, the deputy prime ministers, 
addressed the issue of Croatia's economic development, its 
economic stabilization program, and the political situation in 
the country, especially the reintegration of occupied 
territories into Croatia. 
  At the beginning of his contribution Valentic pointed out 
that the reintegration of occupied territories into the Croatian 
legal system was a condition for the achievement of peace in 
both Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and throughout the region. 
He added that the Croatian Government had started working on an 
ambitious program of economic reforms although 25 percent of its 
territory was occupied. 
  Valentic mentioned that the GNP in Croatia was 25 billion 
German marks [DM] -- DM5,000 per capita, which meant that 
Croatia was a medium-industrialized country. 
  Valentic said the average income in Croatia amounted to 
DM450 
and that it should reach DM500 by the end of 1994. He said that 
this meant that Croatia was one of the leading countries among 
those that have left behind real socialism. He claimed that 
these were the elements for a "standby" arrangement with the 
International Monetary Fund that would be signed in September 
1994. 
  He claimed that two-thirds of GNP was being exported and 
that 
Croatia would have a DM2 billion surplus in the balance of 
payments this year. 
  He said that exports would rise 17 percent and that hard 
currency reserves already amounted to $1.6 billion with the 
likelihood of reaching $2.3 billion by the end of the year since 
it was expected that the tourist season would be good. 
  Valentic further discussed the second stage in the 
implementation of the stabilization program and especially 
referred to the revitalization of the shipbuilding industry and 
reorganization of banks. He mentioned that foreigners had been 
increasingly investing in Croatia adding that an agreement on a 
$128 million loan would be signed with the World Bank in 
Washington on 23 June. 
  Mr. Mate Granic addressed the problem of UN Protection Zones 
and pointed out that the Croatian Government supported a 
peaceful integration of occupied territories into its legal 
system. He mentioned the implementation of Washington 
agreements, the federation of Croats and Muslims in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the confederation between Croatia and the 
Federation of Bosnia- Herzegovina. He expressed the hope that 
Croatia would become a member of the European Council by the end 
of the year. 
  Borislav Skegro referred to the implementation of the 
stabilization program, pointing out that the inflation rate 
dropped to 4 percent per year. He said that the production had 
not been reduced and supported an intense liberalization of the 
market and quick privatization. 
  After their presentations Valentic, Granic and Skegro 
answered questions asked by participants. 
  The Croatian prime minister prepared a dinner for the 
participants on Saturday evening. The "Forum Universale" 
meeting will end on Sunday [19 June].

<F P=106> [Report by D. Blazevic: "We Do Not Want To Give Up a Single </F>
Inch of Croatian Territory!"] 
  [Text] Sibenik -- "If the enemy should even think of 
firing a single shell at Sibenik again, I can tell him with full 
responsibility that he will not fire again!" This was the 
message addressed by Janko Bobetko, the head of the Croatian 
Army General Staff, to the members of the 113th Sibenik brigade 
at a ceremony on the occasion of its third anniversary. 
  Before soldiers, officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
numerous guests -- including Vinko Nikolic, personal envoy of 
the Croatian president; Josip Juras, deputy defense minister; 
General Ante Gotovina, commander of the Split Military Region; 
Admiral Sveto Letica, General Milivoj Petkovic, General Ivan 
Basarac, as well as the president of the County of Sibenik, and 
the mayor of Sibenik -- Colonel Milan Perkovic, the commander of 
the 113th brigade, recalled the days when the Sibenik brigade 
was established. He mentioned that the brigade had participated 
in the defense of Lisane, Velika Glava and Dubravica as early as 
July and August 1991. He stated that the first shells against 
Chetniks were fired on 1 August 1991. "A real undertaking was, 
however, the battle for Sibenik in September 1991," he said. 
This already historic battle is considered the key turning 
point in the war for the independent Croatia. Nos Kalik was 
liberated in March 1992, but the liberation of Miljevacki 
Plateau in June 1992 is, according to Perkovic, the most 
important victory achieved by the 113th brigade. The brigade 
was not only active in the territory of its county, it also 
participated in battles on the southern front, Stolovi, or the 
Zadar hinterland. According to Colonel Perkovic this brigade is 
still ready to accomplish every task assigned to it. 
  In his address to the soldiers, guests, and the inhabitants 
of Sibenik, Janko Bobetko said: "Why did the enemy choose 
Sibenik of all places as his aim? This is not a coincidence, 
this was the place where they wanted to begin the 
materialization of the dream of a Greater Serbia. They knew 
that this would be the strongest infliction on the dignity of 
Croatian people. They wanted to split Croatia into two parts at 
this point; they wanted to become masters of Sibenik. The 
second blow was directed at Zadar, and the third one should have 
been aimed at the Neretva River. Croatia would have been 
subjugated in this way, it would have lost its sea and its 
coast, it would have lost its islands and its connection to the 
world. They had been working on these plans for years. They 
waited for a favorable moment to achieve their aim. If the 
brave men from Sibenik and all over Croatia had not realized 
that that was a historic moment, if they had not been decisive, 
we would read in papers today: 'The Croats used to live here!' 
Sibenik must know that its famous history has been continued, 
that it has defended itself, that it has defended Croatia. If 
Sibenik had fallen, events would have probably unfolded in a 
completely different way," Bobetko said and repeated his message 
addressed to Martic and "his hen hawks," as he called them: "If 
they dared attack Sibenik -- the heart of Croatia -- once again, 
we would strike back with full force." 
  "We have provided irrefutable evidence that Croatia supports 
peaceful solutions; we have made concessions, but we have 
retained our national right to liberate our territory. Let us 
do everything in order to retain our territory, since history 
does not allow us to give up a single inch of our territory. We 
only have to decide when to do that. We shall go into this 
battle in order to expel the enemy from sacred Croatian 
territory," Bobetko concluded. In the end he said that this is a 
year of big historical events, during which the Croatian army 
and Croatian people need support and unity. Josip Juras, the 
deputy defense minister, added that 113th brigade was a famous 
elite brigade that defeated the notorious 9th Knin Corps and 
brought Mladic's troops to a halt. 
  This occasion was used to promote and award soldiers, 
officers and noncommissioned officers. The guests visited an 
exhibition of photographs by Sime Strikoman from the war 
itinerary of the 113th brigade. A wreath was laid on the grave 
of dead soldiers from the 113th brigade.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received leaders 
of all parliamentary parties in the presidential palace today. 
All those invited attended the talks except for Stipe Mesic, 
president of the Croatian Independent Democrats [HND]. 
  In compliance with his constitutional duty, stipulated in 
Article 94 of the Croatian Constitution, to ensure respect for 
the Constitution and normal functioning of state authorities, 
President Tudjman called on the party leaders to show respect 
for the results of the democratic multiparty elections and to 
make their actions comply with democratic parliamentary rules of 
behavior in bodies elected by popular vote. 
  President Tudjman stressed that all political parties should 
primarily take into consideration the basic interests of the 
Croatian people and the Croatian state. These interests are 
being expressed today through specific problems, which must be 
resolved within the Croatian parliament, as a legislative and 
political representative body. He added that time and energy 
should not be wasted on useless party bickering of a procedural 
nature. 
  President Tudjman called on all those present to make 
additional efforts to find a solution through agreement. But he 
stressed that the parliamentary speaker was elected legitimately 
and in accordance with the law, and that this can not be 
questioned. 
  The parliamentary party presidents agreed that interparty 
talks should resume immediately with the aim of finding a 
solution through agreement, the president's office said in a 
statement.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Mikelic in Trieste?"] </F>
  [Text] Ljubljana, Trieste -- The speculations of the 
Italian right wing with Istria and Dalmatia are limitless, the 
Trieste correspondent of Ljubljana DELO writes. He proves this 
with an invitation to visit Trieste that the neofascist party's 
councilor Sergio Giacomelli has extended to the Petrinja 
usurper, Boris Mikelic [prime minister of the republic fo 
Serbian Krajina, RSK]. The Italian Foreign Ministry rules out 
any possibility of Mikelic holding talks with the 
representatives of the Italian Government. The Italian 
neofascists are of the opinion that Knin has the right to 
self-determination and that the recognition of independence of 
the so-called Knin Krajina would open possibilities for the 
autonomy of Istria, DELO writes.

<F P=106> [Interview with Adalbert Rebic, head of the Office for </F>
Refugees and Displaced Persons of the Government of the Republic 
of Croatia, by Lidija Krslak; place and date not given: "Open 
the Gate of Free Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Since the beginning of the aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the arrival of the first wave of refugees 
in Croatia, the information on the number of refugees provided 
by Bosnia-Herzegovina differed from that provided by Croatia 
more often than not. 
  [Krslak] Although the new registering of refugees is yet to 
take place, how many are there in the Republic of Croatia 
according to the data you have? How many are in private 
accommodation and how many in organized accommodation, and what 
is the ethnic composition? 
  [Rebic] Since the beginning of the aggression against 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, hundreds of thousands of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
refugees have passed through Croatia, of which 250,000 are still 
in Croatia. The first refugees were from Herzegovinian towns and 
villages, as the JNA [Yugoslav National Army] violently attacked 
Herzegovina first. However, when Herzegovina was liberated from 
the Serbian JNA and the paramilitary formations, the 
Herzegovinian refugees immediately returned to their homes in 
the liberated towns and villages of western Herzegovina and the 
Neretva River basin. Immediately after the aggression against 
Herzegovina, the Serb formations attacked all the areas of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in early April 1992, some 1,000 refugees 
per day who entered Croatia. The greatest number of refugees 
arrived during the summer of 1992, from the Banja Luka area, 
from Bosanska Krajina, Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, and Bosanska 
Posavina. In June 1992, there were 280,000 refugees in Croatia. 
We then held an international conference in Zagreb (on 9 June) 
and asked for urgent aid in food and accommodation capacities. 
We were setting up tents, because all the facilities were 
already occupied. During July and August, Germany, Switzerland, 
and the Netherlands took 17,000 refugees to relieve the refugee 
situation in Croatia. In the late fall of 1992, there were 
about 370,000 refugees in Croatia. We were building refugee 
camps and restoring the former army barracks and other 
facilities. We still had refugees living in tents, whom we only 
managed to accommodate in November. Many were leaving for third 
countries, especially in Europe. In April 1993, we made a list 
of all the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, and established 
that there were exactly 269,005 in Croatia in that month. We 
keep the names and other necessary information in the database 
that has been used by other local and foreign institutions that 
needed the exact number of refugees in order to provide better 
care. No one else was able to state data other than what we 
collected through the registration, which we keep in the 
database. 
  The greatest number of refugees after this registration was 
in February this year: 331,000 refugees. Since then, the 
number of refugees has been decreasing gradually: some have 
returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina, and some are still going to 
third countries. On 25 May this year, we had 267,516 refugees, 
of which there are 238,516 registered and some 28,000 
non-registered (this is our estimate). Some 67,000 refugees 
stay in organized accommodation, for which we pay 750 kunas (200 
German marks [DM]) per person per month on average, and 180,000 
refugees live in families or independently, for whom we pay 100 
kunas (DM25) per person per month to the people who provide 
homes for them. We also provide food for the latter. 
  We allow for the possibility that among the registered there 
may be some who, in the meantime, went to third countries or 
returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina without having deregistered. We 
are therefore going to carry out another registration of the 
refugees so that we will again have the correct information on 
the number of refugees that will prove trustworthy both to our 
public and the international public. Croatia is one of the few 
countries that carries out these registration procedures and has 
accurate data regarding the number of refugees and displaced 
persons. 
  As far as the ethnic composition is concerned, about 55 
percent are Bosnians of Islamic faith, and some 45 percent are 
Catholics, that is, Croats. However, this new registration will 
show the exact ratio. 
  [Krslak] The fact is that the number of refugees was often 
used as the "trump card" in the political negotiations, even in 
economic agreements. The manager of a certain bank has 
"procured" an arrangement with Kuwait, having given the figure 
of 70,000 Muslims in Croatia. What is your comment on such 
manipulations of the refugees? 
  [Rebic] As far as using the number of refugees in 
political talks or economic agreements is concerned, I cannot 
tell you anything, as I have no such information. Numbers of 
refugees and displaced persons are certainly mentioned in all 
the political talks; it is inevitable. After all, they are 
persons who are the greatest victims of the Serb aggression, of 
the war against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. They should be 
given proper accommodation and enabled to return to their homes. 
In that context, politics can help a great deal. I do not know 
of any "procured" arrangement of "a certain" bank with Kuwait. 
Since the name of the bank, the place, the manager's name, the 
time of "procuring," and other information has not been stated, 
I consider it to be simply a rumor. You can be sure that Kuwait 
would have asked me about the number of refugees before entering 
such "procurement." In our experience, the Arabic and Islamic 
humanitarian organizations were, in general, very cautious about 
giving humanitarian aid, and they were mainly giving it for the 
Muslims. Therefore, there have been no manipulations with the 
refugees. On the contrary, many Croatian banks, companies, and 
humanitarian organizations were very generous with humanitarian 
aid and money for the refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina, not 
asking about their ethnic or religious orientation. Croatia has 
been the greatest benefactor to the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees. 
  [Krslak] Regarding the expected return of the refugees from 
Croatia to their homeland, to the liberated areas, you have 
pointed out many times that Croatia cannot bear such refugee 
pressure. In Sarajevo you asked that the refugee problem be 
first resolved in Croatia. What suggestions do you have related 
to this? 
  [Rebic] Regarding the expected return of the refugees to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities 
have been insisting on, we will sign an agreement on the 
organized and safe return of all the refugees to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with the authorities of the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. We want the return of the refugees from 
Croatia to Bosnia-Herzegovina to be implemented soon in all the 
safe areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as has been the case with the 
displaced persons in Croatia. We arranged that in principle 
while we were in Sarajevo; the specific modes will be agreed 
upon in the agreement and protocol on our return. Croatia is 
still overburdened by refugees. It has the greatest number of 
refugees, that is, more than Germany. I believe that there are 
no more than 200,000 refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina in Germany 
-- I do not want to discuss how many there are from the 
territory of the former Yugoslavia! 
  [Krslak] You have recently stated that the return of the 
refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented sooner than 
the return of the displaced persons to the occupied territories 
in Croatia. What is your estimate based on, and what plans for 
the return to Bosnia-Herzegovina do you suggest, having met with 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina authorities in Sarajevo, and with Mr. 
Izetbegovic? 
  [Rebic] I said that the return of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
refugees to Bosnia-Herzegovina would be implemented before the 
return of our displaced persons to the occupied areas, or the 
UNPA's [UN Protected Areas] and pink zones; namely, the return 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees to the free part of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is already possible. Naturally, there is 
still the unresolved issue of the refugees from the areas of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that have been occupied by the Serb Chetniks. 
Their eventual return will depend on the return of the 
displaced persons to the occupied territories of Croatia. I 
believe that these two segments of the problem will have to be 
solved together. 
  [Krslak] Will Croatia be able to offer the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees the freedom of the choice to stay, 
as some other European countries (for instance, Sweden) have 
done? 
  [Rebic] Croatia will certainly have to keep some refugees 
eventually, as they will not want to return to Bosnia. Some 
have already found jobs in Croatia and bought or exchanged 
apartments or houses. It is inevitable that some refugees 
always stay in the country that took them in. However, not too 
many will stay in Croatia, because Bosnia-Herzegovina is close, 
and because it is difficult to get a job in Croatia. There are 
still some 260,000 unemployed in Croatia. This is a great 
problem for the reintegration of the refugees. Croatia also has 
240,000 displaced persons, some of whom will also not want to 
return to their homes. As far as other countries are concerned, 
some of them will certainly keep some of the refugees, as they 
need workers. You can be sure that if they had as great a 
number of unemployed (relatively) as Croatia does, they would 
not even have let them into their country. At any rate, you 
probably know that in France, England, and some other large 
countries of Europe there are no more than 5,000 Bosnia- 
Herzegovina refugees. Only Germany (180,000), Austria (40,000), 
Switzerland (40,000), Slovenia (22,000), Norway (14,000), and 
Denmark (15,000) took a larger number of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
refugees. 
  [Krslak] Regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees, the most 
topical problem are the refugees from central Bosnia, who are 
accommodated in the Slovenian company vacation homes. Are there 
any chances for this problem to be solved with a compromise 
between the three interested parties (the owners, your office, 
and the refugees)? 
  [Rebic] The Bosnia-Herzegovina refugees who are accommodated 
in the Slovenian company vacation homes will move to other 
refugee centers immediately after school is over.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dobromir Zadgorski, chairman of Nationwide </F>
Committee on Defense of National Interests, by Vanya Kamburova; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kamburova] Mr. 
Zadgorski, in the declaration of the Fatherland Party of Labor 
[OPT] you expressed the opinion that you will appear in an 
alliance with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] in the next 
elections also. How do you view the decisions of the 41st BSP 
Congress in this context? 
  [Zadgorski] The 41st BSP Congress definitely took place in a 
democratic spirit. There was a very constructive change at the 
congress -- the rejuvenation of the Supreme Council and the 
consolidation of the line according to which the BSP is led by 
young people. The election of Zhan Videnov as party chairman 
proves that the young cadres in the BSP are finding their place 
in the party's front ranks ever more. The congress gave carte 
blanche to the young members, and this is very good. We are 
especially satisfied with the decision on the early elections 
and the decision that denounces the Turkicization in the mixed 
population regions. 
  [Kamburova] How do you forecast the next elections? 
  [Zadgorski] Some 200,000 voters are behind us. Our 
organization is very strong in the six mixed regions. We have 
very strong positions in Varna, Dobrich, Ruse, and Veliko 
Turnovo. In Turnovo, for example, we have six city councillors. 
I definitely think that the coalition will win the election, 
and I will even take a risk and make a direct prophecy -- we 
will be 10-15 percent ahead of the Union of Democratic Forces 
[SDS]. We have a total of 90 municipal councillors in about 30 
cities and three deputies in the National Assembly. We think 
that our presence will grow after the new elections. I consider 
it very important that the BSP supports our views regarding the 
national interests. We are not allies in the literally sense of 
this word. We only formed a preelection alliance, which gives 
us the right to independence in adopting our decisions. We 
worked and will continue to work in a collegial manner in the 
parliament, and will continue to give priority to our national 
interests. 
  [Kamburova] Is there democracy in adopting decisions in the 
Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD]? 
  [Zadgorski] Yes, the BSP does not impinge upon our right to 
adopt independent decisions. Our contradictions were related 
exclusively to issues regarding the cabinet of Professor Berov, 
because it was formed with the mandate of the Movement for 
Rights and Freedoms [DPS] -- a movement we do not recognize. We 
consider it an anti-Bulgarian movement. We voted against the 
government in all the no-confidence votes. We only supported 
the Budget Bill, because we thought that our country needs it. 
Those are no contradictions with our colleagues in the PSSD, 
but only different views. In all other cases we were united -- 
for example, the Yakoruda case, the UN corridor, Bulgaria's 
neutrality in the events in former Yugoslavia, and so forth. 
  [Kamburova] What difficulties does your party have in 
regions with a mixed population? 
  [Zadgorski] They spring first of all from the local 
administrative power, which is in the hands of the DPS. It does 
everything possible to assert itself among people of Bulgarian 
origin. Competent people are being fired and this is explained 
by pseudo-national interests. Our categorical objection is in 
this sphere. We also have problems with the "Dogan Law," but we 
try to protect the Bulgarians even in this sphere, naturally, 
without violating the interests of others. 
  [Kamburova] What is the influence of the DPS in those 
regions at the present moment? 
  [Zadgorski] The influence of the DPS in those regions is 
decreasing in a catastrophic manner. Even if the present 
Election Law with its 4 percent barrier remains, I think that 
they will have serious difficulties. The false nature of the 
interests of this movement's leaders was already grasped by the 
population. Some voted "with their feet," and left for Turkey. 
Others are bitterly disappointed, and they will not support the 
DPS. Yet others have lost their confidence and they will simply 
not vote.

  [Text] Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, 
arrived in Bucharest one hour ago on a state visit. The guest 
was welcomed at Bucharest Otopeni Airport by Romanian Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu. The Czech president is accompanied 
on this visit by Jiri Skalicky, minister of national property 
and privatization, Alexandr Vondra, first deputy foreign 
minister, Jaromir Kvapil, ambassador of the Czech Republic to 
Bucharest, and other officials. 
  Here is the statement made by President Vaclav Havel upon 
arrival. The statement has been translated by our colleague 
Pavel Mocan: 
  [Begin Havel recording] This is the first time that I am in 
Romania. This is an official state visit that is meant to 
emphasize the good relations between our countries. Within the 
framework of these relations, we will sign the treaty on 
friendly relations and cooperation between our countries. I am 
convinced that we will proceed to an exchange of experience as 
far as developments in our countries are concerned, and we will 
exchange views on general European issues. Apart from the talks 
that I am going to have with President Iliescu, I will meet with 
the prime minister of the Romanian Government and with 
representatives of the parliament. The delegation that I am 
leading also includes the minister of privatization, who is 
prepared to proceed to an exchange of views with his Romanian 
counterparts on the issue of the privatization process. [end 
recording] 
  About one hour ago, Romanian President Ion Iliescu welcomed 
President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel in a ceremony that 
took place at Cotroceni Palace.

<F P=106> [Statement by Vaclav Havel, president of the Czech Republic, </F>
at news conference held at Bucharest Cotroceni Palace -- live in 
Czech with passage by passage translation into Romanian, 
translated from Romanian] 
  [Text] It is a particular pleasure for me at the end of my 
visit to express thanks for the warm hospitality with which I 
was welcomed throughout my visit to Romania. 
  I can confirm what President Iliescu has said, namely that 
between our countries there are no differences at all in the 
field of foreign policy regarding events in Europe and the goals 
that the two countries promote in their foreign policies. I 
have recalled on various occasions the stages that can indeed 
confirm the mutual feelings of sympathy that have developed 
between our two nations throughout history. I can remember the 
favorable way in which the public in Czechoslovakia hailed the 
support granted to them by Romania in 1968 and I can remember 
just as well the state of anxiety and disgust that the public in 
Czechoslovakia felt toward what was happening in the last years 
of the Ceausescu era. For example, Ceausescu's initiative to 
destroy villages met with the Czechoslovak public's complete 
disapproval. I can also remember the great interest showed by 
the public in Czechoslovakia in the events that led to the fall 
of the Ceausescu regime, as well as the feelings of empathy 
nurtured by the Czechoslovak public for the revolution that 
unfortunately resulted in the loss of so many lives. Apart from 
the political goal of this visit which culminated with the 
signing of the treaty on friendly relations and cooperation 
between Romania and the Czech Republic, our presence in 
Bucharest has also made a contribution to a more profound 
familiarization with realities in Romania and with the 
development of the political situation in this country. 
  During the official talks we held with President Iliescu, 
Prime Minister Vacaroiu, and the presidents of the two chambers 
of the Romanian Parliament, but also during informal occasions, 
such as the official dinner that took place last night, I had an 
opportunity to understand more clearly the way in which 
democracy in Romania operates. The meeting I had at Bucharest 
University with representatives of the opposition, with whom I 
discussed various aspects of Romanian life, gave me the 
opportunity to get to know Romania better. 
  I am firmly convinced that the economic and political 
relations between our countries will continue to progress and I 
have the feeling that the next step that we could take would be 
to sign an accord on free trade. We estimate that such an 
accord could be signed this coming fall on the occasion of the 
meeting of the two premiers. In conditions of a market economy, 
as far as a development of economic relations are concerned, 
everything depends on economic companies. However, governments 
can also make a contribution to this development by creating a 
concrete framework for the development of such relations and I 
am sure that the governments of these two countries, that is, of 
Romania and the Czech Republic, can do this. 
  Once again, I wish to express thanks for this invitation and 
the hospitality extended to me and for the fact that I was given 
the opportunity to visit Romania for the first time in my life.

  [Text] Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the Romanian 
Government and coordinator of the Council for National 
Minorities, received Alexandr Vondra, first deputy foreign 
minister of the Czech Republic, at Victoria Palace. 
  The guest noted that in the opinion of his government, Czech 
minorities are forging a cultural heritage that make an 
essential contribution to Czech civilization. He also presented 
the guidelines of an extensive project aimed at supporting Czech 
minorities throughout the world, to cultivate and preserve their 
national identity. This project, the financing of which is in 
the process of being approved, among other things stipulates 
support of Czech minorities through education and culture, 
through the exchange of teaching staff, as well as support in 
the development of infrastructure in areas inhabited by the 
Czech minority. 
  In order to expand this project to the Czech minority living 
in Romania, Alexandr Vondra asked for the support of the 
Romanian Government and the Council for Ethnic Minorities. 
  Viorel Hrebenciuc stressed the good relations between the 
government of Romania and the leadership of the Union of Czechs 
and Slovaks in Romania, as well as the important role played by 
this organization in the activity of the Council for National 
Minorities; declared the complete openness of the Romanian 
government for the project to support the Czech minority in our 
country, stressing the need for the Union of Czechs and Slovaks 
in Romania to get involved in all stages of examination and 
implementation of this project. In this way, according to the 
opinion expressed by the Romanian side, closer cooperation 
between Romania and Czechia and between the government of the 
two countries will be established, cooperation that might expand 
to actions regarding ethnic minorities within the framework 
offered by the Central European Initiative, the Balladur Plan, 
the Council of Europe, and the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe. So reads a press release that we have 
received from the government spokesman.

  [Text] Today in the afternoon hours representatives of the 
parliament factions of the opposition [the Democratic Convention 
of Romania -- CDR -- and the Democratic Party -- PD] held a 
meeting during which they elaborated the opposition's joint 
action strategy. 
  This is what PD Deputy Chairman Adrian Severin declared to 
our reporters after the conclusion of the meeting: 
  [Begin Severin recording] First I would like to counter all 
speculations and rumors about the so-called dissolution of the 
opposition or about the lessening of the opposition's ability to 
act. 
  The PD believes that the current opposition in Romania is 
able to and is actually acting in a united and unitary way, and 
that it represents a real alternative to the current state power. 
  Regarding the talks we held today, we tried, in concordance 
with certain traditions we have already developed, to correlate 
our actions, considering that both in the CDR, within that 
alliance, and in the relations between the CDR and the PD there 
are, obviously, certain varying nuances, discrepancies among the 
programs and ideologies. 
  We found that the dialogue between the administration, 
between the government and the population of the country by 
means of the parliament is deficient; we found that the 
interpellation instrument [of the executive], the 
question-answer method has become totally inefficient, so that 
practically speaking the government currently is not accountable 
to anyone in any way for the activity it exerts. This is why we 
are examining a draft motion by which we wish to compel the 
government to explain to us the policy it is implementing and 
whether it intends to go on making the same mistakes is has made 
until now, which led to the drop in the standard of living. 
  At the same time, this morning, parallel to the CDR, the PD 
issued a communique, in which it expresses its regrets over the 
fact that Ambassador Traian Chebeleu, the spokesman of the 
presidency, rejected -- in our opinion in a superficial way -- 
the dialogue requested by the opposition parliament faction 
between the president and the parliament on certain 
constitutional issues. 
  As far as we are concerned, we believe that after President 
Iliescu has sufficiently pondered our request, he could give us 
a favorable reply. If he fails to give us an answer, it is 
obvious that we will have to very carefully consider our next 
moves. [end Severin recording] 
  This is what University Professor Emil Constantinescu, the 
chairman of the CDR stated to our reporters: 
  [Begin Constantinescu recording] I believe that Mr. Adrian 
Severin has touched on a number of essential things that ought 
to be further detailed for your listeners. 
  Quite often mass media commentators, but also a large part 
of 
the population, expects the opposition to accomplish things that 
can only be achieved by the state power and the executive. The 
role of the opposition is a different one: First, in 
Parliament, it is to represent the interests of the citizens and 
to watch that their dialogue with the state power takes place in 
a democratic way, through their elected representatives. 
  Referring to the first issue we discussed, I believe that 
the 
letter addressed to President Iliescu [inviting him to 
Parliament] by the CDR and the PD is, above all, helping the 
president. And we do believe that he will answer Parliament 
seriously. Because after having dented the prestige of the 
juridical authority, I do not believe that the president will 
continue by showing contempt for the lawmakers' authority. 
Otherwise I wonder what sort of image President Iliescu has of 
the presidential institution. This is the essential issue and I 
do not understand why he should be afraid to present to 
Parliament the reasons he adopted the stance he expressed in 
Satu-Mare. 
  Regarding the censure motion, it is the only way of making 
the government, which has treated the citizens of the country in 
an arrogant way, come to Parliament and, through Parliament, 
actually present to the citizens a balance of its achievements. 
And, above all, present the way it has implemented its own 
program. Let us not forget that the first censure motion 
initiated by the CDR [in 1993] was intended to make clear who is 
responsible for the implementation of the government program. 
Following the rejection of our motion, the government assumed 
responsibility for it in the name of the majority in Parliament. 
Now we have to check which of the points they set for 
themselves as a goal have really been achieved and which have 
not. This is a right of the citizens of Romania, a right they 
must exert. [end recording]

  [Text] Today, Mr. Victor Surdu, chairman of the Democratic 
Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR], held an extraordinary news 
conference during which he presented the letter addressed by 
that political party to the members of the Senate and the 
Chamber of Deputies, as well as the text of the censure motion 
by which the PDAR activates the procedure of withdrawing the 
confidence granted to the government. 
  The principal reason of the censure motion, the document 
emphasizes, is based on the current negative state of our 
economic and social life, with grave consequences upon the level 
of the standard of living. 
  The motion also mentions the lack of certain concrete 
government programs and the critical condition of Romanian 
agriculture, which proves the inability of the government to 
solve the economic problems and promote its own program. 
  Commenting on the text of the censure motion, the PDAR 
chairman stressed that it represents a gesture to protest 
against poverty and incertitude and to condemn incompetence and 
inefficiency. 
  Answering journalists' questions, Surdu expressed the hope 
that the censure motion will be seconded by parties with more 
weight in parliament, and added that the PUNR [National Romanian 
Unity Party] has already expressed its readiness to do so. In 
that context, Surdu said that if other parties also want to 
initiate censure motions, the PDAR leadership will examine such 
initiatives, and if they also include the claims of the PDAR, it 
cannot be excluded that the party will support such motions. 
  Considering that the current structure of parliament does 
not 
offer any answers to the question toward what kind of society we 
are heading, Surdu also said, a reevaluation of the Romanian 
political spectrum would be necessary through the organization 
of early elections.

<F P=106> [Editorial in two installments by Ion Cristoiu: "The </F>
Dissolution of the Opposition"] 
<H5>  [17 Jun p 1] </H5>
  [Text] One day last week [14 June], the representatives of 
the opposition gathered at the Ilie Nastase Club -- which is 
also called, by anyone who wishes to seem more 
nationalist-oriented, the Dacia Club -- to discuss the PNTCD 
[National Peasant Christian- Democratic Party] proposal to 
commence procedures to suspend President Ion Iliescu for the 
anticonstitutional statement that he made during his visit to 
Satu-Mare. As is customary among today's Romanian politicians, 
the four-hour congregation of gentlemen representing their 
parties was held behind closed doors. Under the stale-water 
circumstances of our recent domestic political life, the PNTCD 
proposal had a similar effect to that of throwing a rock into a 
lake covered by duckweed. The surface of the lake, which used 
to be smooth and lacking any trace of the slightest swell, now 
suddenly began to churn and roar. It was discovered that 
beneath the layer of mud, there were some diverging points of 
view, even philosophies, dormant, just like the frogs in the 
pond. Obviously, as soon as the press got wind of the 
opposition's closed-doors meeting on the issue of suspending the 
president, the journalists flocked in front of those doors 
eagerly awaiting the news. What on earth could they have been 
talking about for such a long time? What colossal blow is the 
opposition preparing against Iliescu, giving them sufficient 
reason to whisper, so that not a single word could be heard 
outside through the keyhole? Every now and then one of the 
members of the congregation would come out and head for the 
bathroom. They were walking with such gravity that none of the 
journalists dared to approach them or ask them any questions. 
Each of the journalists was simply paralyzed at the thought 
that the politician in question was carrying a huge load of 
secrets to this designated place and his deep concentration not 
to drop it made him move like a sleepwalker. Heaven forfend that 
anyone should pull his sleeve! On would run the risk of seeing 
him collapse to the ground and wriggle convulsively! After four 
hours of waiting, the doors were eventually kind enough to open. 
The assumed coup perpetrators stepped outside and, having been 
authorized to open their mouths, told the journalists what had 
been decided inside, after so much mystery. In the beginning, 
before entering the hall, the politicians had seemed to be 
raging, extremely furious about the president exceeding his 
constitutional prerogatives. To this the journalists had added 
other elements as well (the fact that the meeting was held 
behind closed doors and its unusual length, exceeding four 
hours), so that after they came out of the conference hall, 
everyone expected them to announce draconian measures to punish 
this constitutional criminal. Everyone assessed that, compared 
with the steps to be announced, the PNTCD's previous proposal to 
suspend Iliescu would seem like gently tapping Iliescu on the 
shoulder. After the opposition representatives finished their 
announcement, everyone was totally baffled. After four hours of 
discussions, they decided to punish the president by writing a 
letter to him, inviting him to come to Parliament to tell them 
the story of what happened in Satu-Mare. Not a single word 
condemning Iliescu for stepping from the path established by the 
Constitution! They even renounced the PNTCD proposal to begin 
gathering the signatures of members of Parliament needed to 
begin the procedure of suspending the president. The 
participants in this glorious congregation reached the 
conclusion that, owing to the great distance separating 
Satu-Mare from Bucharest, they had not heard very well what 
Iliescu had actually said. Curious as they are, they now 
invited Iliescu to hear from him personally what had happened. 
For over four hours the mountain quivered and trembled with all 
its might, so that the walls of the club were shaking and the 
very fish in the pond were becoming nervous, until eventually it 
gave birth to a little mouse! Nothing was easier for Cotroceni 
[seat of the president] than replying to this puerile 
provocation with a gesture that reminds one of a slap given to 
someone who is following much too closely. The haughty 
representatives of the opposition were presented with a text 
that actually repeated what the president had stated in 
Satu-Mare. His excellency did not even bother to convey it to 
them personally, but rather preferred to send it to them via 
television, an institution that, as is known, actually works 
like a post office box by which Iliescu sends his letters 
without even having to pay the postage. 
  The ridiculous decision reached at the Nastase Club has 
baffled many people. However, it did not puzzle those who have 
been keeping an eye on what is happening within the opposition. 
Those observers were not at all surprised to see that the 
representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR 
[Democratic Convention of Romania], instead of seconding the 
PNTCD initiative, rather considered it sufficient to address an 
timid invitation to Iliescu, asking him to explain his 
statement. All this clearly signals -- more clearly than 
anything else -- a process that has recently been going on in 
our political life: the dissolution of the opposition. It is a 
very slow, sometimes contradictory process, as are all political 
phenomena that are still hidden from the eyes of public opinion, 
but that stand a good chance of eventually reaching completion. 
  About this, however, in our next issue. 
<H5>  [18 Jun p 1] </H5>
  [Text] In the previous issue of our daily, I pointed out 
the childishness of the decision taken after a four-hour meeting 
of the representatives of the opposition that intended to 
discuss President Iliescu's statements made in Satu-Mare. The 
PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] proposed 
initiating the procedure to have the president suspended from 
his office. After having examined that proposal, the 
representatives of the PD [Democratic Party] and the CDR 
[Democratic Convention of Romania] rejected it and preferred to 
issue a declaration by which Ion Iliescu was invited to come and 
personally offer explanations to parliament. Doubtlessly, such 
a flabby decision -- which was possibly taken so that no one 
could say that they had wasted four hours just chatting -- was 
the result of a compromise. The PNTCD's proposal had caused 
various reactions, some of them were even violently against it, 
among the representatives attending the meeting on the shores of 
the lake. In order to avoid a brawl among them -- as brawls may 
be admirable among street cleaners, but totally unaccepted among 
intellectuals -- they eventually reached a obtuse conclusion 
upon which all of them could agree: To call the president to 
parliament. Abiding by this ridiculous stance, the opposition 
parties' representatives then elaborated a solemn letter sealed 
with numerous signatures, which they subsequently sent to 
Iliescu. Yesterday afternoon, via his spokesman, the president 
replied that he is no mood to go from Cotroceni to Metropolitan 
Hill [parliament headquarters] to offer explanations. An 
arrogant reply given to an arrogant invitation! The opposition 
parties' diverging stance regarding the president's Satu-Mare 
declarations was not the sole instance in which they held 
conflicting opinions recently. There have been other issues as 
well, in the judgment of which some of them went to the left, 
while others went the right: Such were the proposal to take 
[Prime Minister] Nicolae Vacaroiu and [Finance Minister] Florin 
Georgescu to court on penal charges [for having failed to 
elaborate the 1994 state budget in due time], the issue of 
reinstalling monarchy, the draft law on [the legal status of] 
the nationalized dwellings, or the no-confidence motion against 
the government. There have always been divergent opinions among 
the opposition. However, they have never been so absolutely 
divergent and, above all, they have never found expression in 
contradictory action. Formerly they used to manifest themselves 
by the different personal opinions that were expressed. Now, 
however, those discrepancies have also manifested themselves in 
deeds. During the debates on the law on the nationalized 
dwellings, the CDR walked out of parliament hall, while the PD 
representatives remained seated. The unity crisis did not 
merely show in contradictory actions, but it also went as far as 
discrediting each other. The PL-93's [Liberal party '93] 
proposal to initiate a no- confidence motion is being 
continuously postponed from one CDR conference to the other. 
Its coalition partners say neither yes, nor no. The prefer 
ambiguity. This new turn taken by the divergence among the 
opposition parties has its origins in the profound rift existing 
among them regarding the strategy they think best with respect 
to the current ruling coalition headed by Ion Iliescu. One part 
of the opposition wishes to return to the radicalism that 
preceded the amiable phase during which they held negotiations 
with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania]. The other 
part considers such a move to be an enormous mistake. The 
latter are pleading in favor of a policy of compromise. Of 
course, this rift is also visible within the CDR itself, namely 
between the PNTCD--PL-93 pole, on the one hand, and the PAC 
[Civic Alliance Party]--UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania] pole, on the other. However, in the CDR's relations 
with the PD, this rift has already developed into a deep 
crevice. Following the [1992] elections, Petre Roman's party 
[the PD] was, over a certain period of time, an untamed enemy of 
the PDSR and Ion Iliescu. In Romania's parliament, the PD 
deputies represented the spearhead of the opposition. Compared 
to their dynamic and audacious way of acting, the stance adopted 
by the rest of the opposition seemed to be akin to the shyness 
of untouched brides. Recently, however, the PD has changed so 
much that one can hardly recognize it. It is not just the fact 
that Petre Roman's party has lost its former radicalism, but it 
has also become a fervent advocate of the compromises and even 
of the harmony that should exist between the opposition and the 
rulers. Intelligent as they are, the PD leaders do not lack 
reasons that they keep bringing up to convince their opposition 
partners, and generally, public opinion, of the rightness of 
their surprising softness. Within the broad process of trying 
to find out the real reasons for their softness, some malevolent 
observers even linked it to the safes in which the General 
Prosecution is keeping the files of the corruption cases 
initiated against certain PD leaders. Others explain this abrupt 
faintness of the PD by the fact that its leader, Petre Roman, is 
travelling abroad most of the time, rather than being at home. 
No doubt about it, the future will disclose the true nature of 
the reasons that made the PD change in such a baffling way. 
Until then, however, two things are already certain: a) The PD 
will have to face the consequences of this compromising policy. 
For instance, left alone in the parliament hall during the 
debates on the nationalized dwellings, it was unable to have 
even one single amendment of its own passed. The majority of 
the opposition was "not amused" seeing this "constructive" 
stance adopted by the PD. b) The dissolution of the 
opposition, as far as CDR--PD relations are concerned, is 
already a visible process. If the CDR fails to perceive this, 
that process may spread to the relations among the CDR member 
parties as well.

<F P=106> [Report by Aasmund Willersrud: "Romania Does Not Want To </F>
End Up Last in Line"] 
  [Text] Bucarest -- There are scarcely any other capitals 
in the former East bloc where you immediatley meet with 
expressions of satisfaction with the integration process in 
Europe. The government in Bucarest was the first to grasp -- 
and to do so with great eagerness -- NATO's offer of Partnership 
for Peace. Openly and pragmatically the Romanians realize that 
it will take time before both NATO and the EU [European Union] 
open their doors for full membership for former Warsaw Pact 
countries. But when this finally happens, these countries must 
join as a group. 
  "Nondiscrimination is a clear precondition," Foreign 
Ministry 
Under Secretary of State Ion Gorita told AFTENPOSTEN. 
"Partnership expressly lays this down and opens up a host of 
possibilities, from Bucarest's viewpoint. Integration in 
Atlantic cooperation has absolute priority in Romanian foreign 
policy." 
  For good or ill Romania sees itself as a Balkan country. 
Ideally an "island of stability" in the most troubled region in 
Europe, a diplomatic intermediary with open channels to all the 
republics in the former Yugoslavia. But in strategic terms a 
country without allies, wedged between areas of explosive 
conflict in the Balkans and in the former Soviet empire. 
  The conflict surrounding the lifting of the arms embargo 
against the sides in the Yugoslavia conflict is causing cold 
shivers in Bucarest. People are convinced that more arms and 
military intervention from the East or West would lead 
inevitably to the spread of the war. The rest of the world must 
continue to apply political pressure, but today no one other 
than the partners themselves can resolve the conflict, in the 
view of the Romanians. 
  The Romanians' traditional friendship with Serbia gave rise 
to some skepticism in Western circles, but the government says 
that it is endeavoring to loyally observe the international 
blockade. Even thought this means enormous losses for a country 
which was already poor. 
  Romania is a large nation with 23 million inhabitants. A 
unified state, the government points out, despite all the unrest 
surrounding the Hungarian minority which is calling for 
autonomy. The most repressed and backward of the countries of 
Eastern Europe also emerged from 1989, the year of revolution, 
with the greatest number of problems. Despite all the economic 
and democratic shortcomings today's leaders refuse to accept a 
place last in line for Europe. 
  "Romania has strongly opposed the more rapid integration 
into 
NATO of certain states. Hungary before Romania is therefore out 
of the question," Defense Ministry Under Secretary of State 
Ioan-Mircea Pascu said. "This would not solve any of the 
problems, but rather reinforce the divisions in Europe," he 
warned. 
  Well aware that the four richer Visegrad states -- Hungary, 
Poland, the Czech Republic, and in part Slovakia -- consider 
themselves to be in a group of their own on the doorstep of both 
NATO and the EU, the leaders in Romania reel off 
counterarguments. Relations with Hungary are and will remain the 
stumbling block, even though there is a confidence that 
socialist leader Gyula Horn will bring more pragmatism into 
foreign policy. 
  "The outgoing government were historians almost to a man. 
Could you expect anything other than history to become the 
driving force in politics?" Pascu asked. Now he sees a chance 
of directing the gaze toward the future instead. 
  "But until we achieve an agreement between the two 
countries as a guarantee of stable and normal good-neighborly 
relations, it is unthinkable that Hungary should be integrated 
before Romania. We are not asking for special friendly 
relations, only ordinary civilized relations," the under 
secretary said. 
  These are strong, but significant words about the situation 
today. Ion Gorita of the Foreign Ministry gave the direct 
warning: "A NATO frontier between Hungary and Romania would be 
a new Iron Curtain -- a frontier that would offer a new conflict 
situation." 
  Nor do the Romanians see any reason why Russia should be 
given special status, even though the country is one of the most 
sensitive security problems in Europe at present. 
  But the Romanians have to ask themselves the key question: 
When will Romania become "mature" enough for admission to the 
European Union and to security structures? Certain economic and 
democratic minimum standards must be met. 
  "From the democratic viewpoint we are already mature 
enough," 
Gorita claimed. "All the institutions are in place, and we have 
been found worthy of admission to the Council of Europe in line 
with similar standards." 
  Many officials I spoke to in Bucarest admit that President 
Ion Iliescu was a problem in relations with foreign countries in 
the initial phase. He was a figure symbolic of the "stillborn 
revolution," a communist who refused to reform the old 
structures. Today this "psychological barrier" has been removed, 
Gorita claimed. And this week Czech President Vaclav Havel is 
coming to pay an official visit -- a figure symbolic of 
democracy in Europe. 
  Economically a good deal remains before Romania comes up to 
the EU's standards, but the under secretary of state sent back 
the challenge to Brussels: "You must help us with investment 
and capital; alone Romania has scarcely a chance."

  [Text] The Vatra Romaneasca Union [UVR] has faxed us a 
message containing a number of stipulations they propose for 
inclusion in the Draft Education Law. 
  Thus, they propose that secondary education in the Romanian 
language should be organized and operate in every village, town, 
and municipality of the country. Entrance examinations, as well 
as all graduation examinations of every kind of educational 
institutions should be held solely in Romanian, while ethnic 
minorities should be granted, in the domain of education, the 
same rights as the Romanian ethnic minority is granted in 
Hungary, and the same rights as ethnic minorities are granted in 
Western democracies, that is, rights as stipulated by the 
relevant international regulations. 
  These proposals were worked out during a meeting of the UVR 
National Steering Committee, which was held on 18 June in the 
town of Lugoj, says the message faxed to us by Zeno Opris, 
chairman of the UVR.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state at the </F>
Ministry of National Defense, by Ralu Filip; place and date not 
given: "Without Reform, the National Security Cannot Be Ensured 
Either"] 
  [Text] National security represents one of the 
fundamental requirements of each country and each nation and 
Romania is no exception to this rule. Taking into account what 
is currently happening in Europe, in certain countries that are 
in our immediate neighborhood, and our geopolitical position, it 
is only natural to try and find out whether we are safe, if we 
can or cannot ensure our national security, and also, what 
domestic and external factors might threaten our country. 
Therefore, we turned to Ioan Mircea Pascu, secretary of state 
with the Ministry of National Defense, who granted us an 
interview on this issue: 
  [Filip] Recently, two documents have been issued: "The 
Integrated Concept for Romania's National Security" and 
"Romania's Defense Military Doctrine." What can you tell us 
about these two documents? 
  [Pascu] The first draft of "The Integrated Concept for 
Romania's National Security" was compiled by experts 
representing all institutions that have responsibility in 
ensuring national security, in accordance with a modern and 
multidimensional understanding of the concept of security. This 
first draft was submitted to the Supreme Council of the 
Country's Defense [CSAT] and was reviewed after the 
establishment of the Partnership for Peace and the statute of 
associate partner offered to Romania by the Western European 
Union. It is the duty of the Ministry of National Defense and 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to finalize the document. As 
far as the "Military Doctrine on Romania's Defense" is 
concerned, it was drafted by a group of experts in the Ministry 
of National Defense and discussed later within the CSAT, a 
council in which other institutions that have a role in ensuring 
the military defense of the country are also represented. 
  [Filip] What was the starting point for the integrated 
concept for national security and on what is this concept based? 
  [Pascu] The concept is based on a careful examination both 
of the international situation, in areas that are farther from 
or closer to Romania, on the profound transformations that have 
taken place and continue to take place in the respective areas 
and at home. The major conclusion of this examination, which is 
also the fundamental requirement of the efforts to ensure 
national security, is that currently and for quite a long time 
to come Romania has no allies and no dependable security 
guarantees. In addition to this, being in the middle of a 
process of domestic transition, this process has inevitably 
reduced the capability to ensure our own security alone, in a 
situation in which we are located in an area characterized by a 
high degree of potential conflict. 
  [Filip] What are the major reasons for Romania's lack of 
security? 
  [Pascu] I believe that the most important reason is the fact 
that, if until 1989 the threats against Romania's security, as a 
member of the Warsaw Pact, were clearly outlined and were mainly 
external, today they have lost their distinctness and the major 
danger is the possibility that internal weaknesses might be 
exploited. The "Integrated Concept..." assesses the internal 
high risk factors among which we can mention Romania's economic 
situation, the social costs of transition, the decline in the 
society's cohesion, the emergence and increase of new 
unconventional risks (misappropriation and smuggling of weapons 
and ammunition, drugs, illegal migration, smuggling of all kinds 
of products, group violence, and all kinds of terrorist actions, 
and so forth) as well as the deterioration in the quality of the 
environment.... 
  [Filip] Excuse me for interrupting, but what is the 
connection between the environment and national security? 
  [Pascu] This is the first time that this element has been 
included in the concept of national security. The quality of 
the environment can affect our security by damaging over the 
long term people's health and their natural living conditions. 
How? Through toxic wastes, disturbance of the ecological 
balance, accidents, and sabotage in important economic 
facilities, including the nuclear one. 
  [Filip] What measures are envisaged to cope with all the 
domestic risk factors? 
  [Pascu] In general, we need the concerted action of all 
political and social forces to ensure the consolidation of the 
country. The national interest is above the interest of 
political parties or other types of social groups. We need a 
structural and functional consolidation in the democratic and 
constitutional framework of the state, of the central and local 
public authorities, of public institutions, and political and 
social pluralism. I am referring to the need to ensure 
efficiency and the continuity of the process of 
economic-structural reform, to introduce the market economy, and 
to ensure the proper functioning of the national economy, also 
in special situations (war, natural disasters, or nuclear 
accidents). In conclusion, one can say that there is a direct 
connection between the reform process and national security. The 
success of reform cannot be ensured without national security 
and in order to ensure security we definitely need to bring the 
reform to a successful conclusion. 
  [Filip] What are the major external risk factors? 
  [Pascu] As has already been mentioned, the danger of armed 
aggression from the outside has been considerably reduced, 
however, the danger generated by foreign interference and 
pressures on Romania continues to prevail. I would like to 
repeat, the exploitation of the domestic situation is the major 
risk. That is why the "Military Doctrine for Romania's Defense" 
clearly states that "combined aggressive actions, that is, the 
organization and deployment of foreign military forces on the 
grounds of potential domestic aggressive actions, represents the 
most dangerous type of actions." 
  [Filip] Nevertheless, would you please enumerate a few 
external risk factors? 
  [Pascu] The emergence and intensification of certain 
conflicts or other forms of tension and the presence of certain 
areas with a higher level of political and military instability 
in Romania's proximity also increase our risks of insecurity. 
The state of tension and major crises in areas neighboring 
Romania can endanger internal stability through the emergence of 
massive waves of refugees, through the economic consequences of 
the act of suspending economic relations with certain countries, 
as a result of the conflict, or through losses provoked by the 
observance of certain decisions of international bodies to which 
we also belong. 
  [Filip] Does not the stability plan adopted recently in 
Paris reduce the number of external risk factors? 
  [Pascu] The stability plan, according to the intention of 
its initiators, is a process of preventive diplomacy. Except 
that I personally believe that to qualify this plan as 
"preventive" also indicates that attempts are made to anticipate 
certain negative states of affair. However, if they have not 
occurred so far, it means that this is due to the action of 
certain factors that might be perturbed precisely by this 
attempt to anticipate them. There is a saying in German: 
Better is the enemy of good. In other words, let us try not to 
provoke certain situations by attempts to prevent them.... 
  [Filip] But what about the agreement on the reduction of 
conventional weapons and troops in Europe? Is it a risk factor 
or a guarantee for Romania's national security? 
  [Pascu] In connection with this accord, one can say that, 
even at the time when it was concluded, it no longer reflected 
the situation that generated it. For example, in the 
NATO-Warsaw Pact military balance, Romania was considered a 
country of secondary importance and the limits established for 
our country reflected this statute. But now, one can say that 
all the countries that were members of the Warsaw Pact have 
become countries of major importance, considering the increased 
degree of insecurity in the common area where they are situated. 
  [Filip] And does it affect us? 
  [Pascu] The accord represents the basis for military 
security on our continent, at least for the time being. There 
has already been pressure from some signatory countries (Russia 
for example) to modify certain stipulations regarding 
deployment. I believe that in spite of the aforementioned 
shortcomings, the act of abandoning the accord would result in 
unforeseeable negative consequences for European security and 
for each country respectively. 
  [Filip] There are some who believe that the Partnership for 
Peace as well as the Paris Accord in reality would aim at 
achieving Romania's disarmament, the dismantling of our military 
industry, and placing Romania clearly in a position of 
inferiority. What is your opinion of all this? 
  [Pascu] I am glad that you use the expression "there are 
some who believe" because a great number of "stories," some more 
interesting than others, have been circulating and will continue 
to circulate about Partnership for Peace. This is also 
happening in other former Warsaw Pact member countries. I do 
not doubt that the military industry in developed countries has 
a certain interest in attempting to overcome current 
difficulties by delivering weapons to the Eastern markets. 
However, at the same time, I would like to stress that the 
Partnership for Peace is a competition in which all of the 
competitors' security factors, including the military industry, 
are being maximally used. Moreover, at least as far as Romania 
is concerned, the position adopted -- which reflects a strategy 
in this area -- is to maintain the capacity of military 
production in spite of participation in the Partnership for 
Peace. 
  [Filip] Taking into account the competition that has been 
created, Romania's position, and the military production 
capacity, how do you regard the budget allotted to the Army? Is 
it a risk factor against national security? 
  [Pascu] Yes and no. Yes, because it cannot be increased to 
the level of our requirements at the moment for tangible 
reasons. No, because it is designated precisely to counteract 
risks against security. 
  [Filip] Romania's geopolitical position raises problems. 
Some nations are afraid of a possible invasion from the 
direction in which Romania is situated, others regard positively 
Romania's geographic location. It is certain that the chance to 
play a military and political role in the area brings us both 
advantages but also disadvantages. What do you think about that? 
  [Pascu] I would proceed from the assessment made by 
General Joulwan, commander of NATO forces, when he visited 
Romania. He said that Romania "is an important country in a 
strategic area." Certainly, this is a double-edged situation, as 
you very well remarked. However, I believe that, if there is 
enough political maturity and political skill -- which Romania 
in general has never lacked -- the positive part will prevail 
over the negative part. 
  [Filip] The visit paid by General Grachev generated various 
reactions, some affirming that Russia is trying to maintain its 
influence over Romania. In general, our political leaders are 
reserved when it comes to our relations with Moscow. Why? 
  [Pascu] General Grachev's visit also emphasizes in a way the 
same thing that General Joulwan said, namely that Romania is an 
important country in a strategic area. If we were to evaluate 
things strictly from a technical viewpoint, than it becomes 
clear why Russia does not wish to completely lose its influence 
over its former allies. However, at the same time, the 
reservations that you are talking about reflect a certain need 
for serious and credible proof from Russia that the efforts it 
is making so as not to lose completely its influence over its 
former allies does not mean the old Soviet behavior. In 
general, not only in the case of Romania, Russia's behavior is 
carefully observed and examined, precisely in order to be able 
to distinguish those changes for the better that the Russian 
political factors are emphasizing in their dialogue with us, 
former allies. 
  [Filip] Will we join NATO regardless of Moscow's position? 
  [Pascu] A first aspect that I would like to stress here is 
that this move of Romania's has no greater or lesser importance 
for Russia than in the case of other countries. The second 
aspect would be that the problem of including all former Warsaw 
Pact countries in NATO is subordinate to another goal, which I 
believe is more important for Russia, namely that of obtaining 
relations of strategic partnership with the Atlantic Alliance. 
That is the reason, at least in theoretical terms, why Russia 
could give in as far as the association of certain former allied 
countries to NATO structures is concerned, if, by paying this 
"price" it could obtain more easily the statute of "strategic 
partner." As a matter of fact, NATO is also engaged in 
discussions with Russia on this issue, trying to achieve a 
weakening of Russia's resistance on the issue of the association 
of certain Eastern and Central European countries to its 
structures. 
  [Filip] Given your position and the information that you 
possess, do you believe that we can set our minds at rest as far 
as the future of Romania's national security is concerned? 
  [Pascu] Apart from unforeseeable events, which unfortunately 
will continue to appear in the near or more distant future, I 
believe that, even if we talk about the medium and long term, we 
can set our minds at rest on this issue and also on Romania's 
integration in European and Euro-Atlantic security structures.

  [Text] In Paris today, Slovak Defense Minister Pavol Kanis, 
who is visiting France for a day, signed an agreement on 
military cooperation between the two countries with his French 
counterpart, Francois Leotard. The agreement does not mention 
joint military exercises. According to Kanis, the new agreement 
is a continuation of cooperation between the two nations during 
the liberation of France and Slovakia in World War II. 
  Leotard promised to take part in the celebrations of the 
Slovak National Uprising in August.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, SDL, by Julius Gembicky; place and date not 
given: "It Will Not Be Weiss From Whom Luptak Will Take Away the 
Biggest Slice of the Electoral Pie"] 
  [Text] The day before yesterday, we published an interview 
with Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] leader Peter Weiss. An 
interesting passage regarding the composition of [Jan] Luptak's 
Association of Workers of Slovakia [ZRS] was left in Julius 
Gembicky's notebook. It would be a pity not to print it. 
  [Gembicky] What are the reactions to the growing distance 
between two related entities, the SDL and the ZRS, particularly 
in central Slovakia, which is the ZRS's stronghold? 
  [Weiss] Everyone knows that the SDL has not given a final no 
to cooperation with the ZRS within the framework of a coalition, 
even though it was the SDL Executive Committee that had actually 
founded this party. We wanted it to be a professional civic 
organization that would analyze workers' problems and 
communicate them to parliament. ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak seems 
to have different ideas, however. What is the ZRS, actually, 
and what does it represent? According to a representative 
sociological survey of March 1994, as many as 30 percent of ZRS 
supporters had previously been Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS] supporters; 12 percent had been SDL supporters; 
6 percent had been Social Democratic Party in Slovakia 
supporters; 8 percent had previously supported the Slovak 
National Party, the Christian Democratic Movement, and the 
Hungarian parties; and 4 percent had been supporters of the 
Democratic Party. In other words, the ZRS is a manifestation of 
workers' discontent with all parties, and it is not just a 
problem for the SDL, as has sometimes being argued. After all, 
only 25 percent of ZRS members subscribe to left-wing values. We 
have never underestimated the importance of the workers 
movement, but we have always refused to follow the path of 
outdoing one another in unrealistic promises. 
  Faced with glances full of expectations, whether it was in 
Spisska Nova Ves or at a meeting with female textile workers of 
the Lykotex Revuca company, we never yielded to the politician's 
temptation to proclaim in loud voice: We are going to resolve 
everything, we will guarantee your jobs. We want to do it, but 
not by means of cheap promises. But our offer of postelection 
cooperation with the ZRS is still on the table.

<F P=106> ["(mst)"-signed report: "Grave Reservations About Jezek's </F>
Resignation"] 
  [Text] Prague -- Yesterday, the National Property Fund 
(FNM) Supervisory Board adopted a resolution in which it called 
upon the FNM Presidium to state the reasons for the resignation 
of the Fund's former chairman, Tomas Jezek, and the recall of 
his two deputies -- Jan Prince and Jindrich Kapoun. 
  Supervisory Board Chairman Pavel Safarik told reporters that 
his body does not see sufficient justification for the 
appointment of Roman Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM 
Executive Council. The argument that, due to the appointment of 
the deputy privatization minister as the Fund's chairman, there 
will be better interlinking between the Privatization Ministry 
and the FNM, seems inadequate to them. In the opinion of the 
Supervisory Board, these two institutions were already in close 
contact prior to the recall of T. Jezek. 
  "The conflict of interests that led officially to Tomas 
Jezek's resignation also relates to Roman Ceska," states the 
resolution. The Supervisory Board also stated that the course of 
action adopted by the Fund's Presidium in the recall of Tomas 
Jezek and his two deputies damaged relations between the 
privatization bodies and, as a consequence, may even endanger 
the entire course of privatization. 
  Jan Klak, a member of the Supervisory Board, declared that 
the Supervisory Board will demand that the Fund's Presidium, 
which is chaired by Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky, airs 
its views immediately on the board's resolution. If its 
response is inadequate, the Supervisory Board is prepared to 
turn the matter over to parliament and the government. 
Speculation that parliament could recall the Fund's Presidium 
was described as premature by Safarik. 
  In reply to a question on what he thinks of the Supervisory 
Board's resolution, FNM Chairman R. Ceska said that he had not 
been informed of the contents of the board's meeting and refused 
to comment. He said that he was not directly involved in the 
recall of T. Jezek and that it would vex him if this were to 
lead to a tense situation between him and the Supervisory Board. 
He said that on Friday [17 June] morning he had asked the 
Supervisory Board to help him resolve the situation in the FNM 
in a calm manner. In reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY 
regarding the state of the FNM when he took over from T. Jezek, 
R. Ceska said: "There are certain problems of a more serious 
nature here and they will not be resolved by waving a magic 
wand." 
  [The same newspaper on the same date on page 3, under the 
headline "Skalicky Is Standing Behind Ceska," carries a 300-word 
CTK and "(il)"-signed report on Privatization Minister Jiri 
Skalicky's reaction to the resolution adopted by the FNM 
Supervisory Board. According to the report, Skalicky "does not 
understand the formulation" according to which the board "does 
not see sufficient justification for the appointment of Roman 
Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM Executive Council." He 
said that "he is prepared to inform the Supervisory Board in 
detail of the reasons for this step" and added that the FNM 
Presidium had tried "to ensure that the necessary changes in the 
FNM's management were not made in an atmosphere of emotion and 
mutual recrimination. Therefore, the Presidium's members did 
not inform the public of the circumstances of Tomas Jezek's 
resignation."]

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F>
Martinkova; place and date not given: "To This Day, I Have 
Heard Nothing About Any Faction"] 
  [Text] [Martinkova] You have said that you know nothing 
about any faction within the Civic Democratic Party [ODS]. Do 
you accept the possibility that a faction could evolve sometime 
in the future? Would you perceive it as a threat to the party's 
integrity? 
  [Klaus] To this day, I have really heard nothing about this; 
I have only read about it in LIDOVE NOVINY. Neither myself nor 
the ODS leadership have yet come across another member of this 
so-called faction. I also do not know how to interpret the word 
faction in this context. The fact that various people in the 
same political party have different views on the privatization 
of CKD [engineering plant], on the privatization of Homolka 
[Prague hospital], or on the size of the higher 
self-administration units is simply logical, and I think that it 
would be unnatural if this were not the case. Should the 
consequence of this be that a political party will become 
divided? It does not seem to me that this would lie ahead of us. 
  Let us define the word faction. Is this, perhaps, a small 
group of people that is concerned more about restitution in 
agriculture than any other small group? The fact that this 
small group meets more often and has a more trenchant point of 
view on this issue than the rest of the ODS is absolutely 
logical. The word faction seems to me to be unnecessarily 
strong and has a certain cautionary tinge for me. If we are 
talking about groups of people with a different emphasis on 
different things, then this certainly is not a faction. We have 
always had strong agricultural and ecological groups and a group 
dealing with railroad transportation within the ODS. I would 
consider this to be natural and normal. 
  [Martinkova] The statistics for the first four months of 
this year point to a slight decline in industrial output. The 
result should be rising unemployment. It, however, is falling. 
How do you explain these two contradictory trends? 
  [Klaus] How can these two contradictory figures be made 
compatible by means of an explanation? This is just what I have 
been talking about in Nove Straseci at a meeting with 80 labor 
office managers. The explanation is very simple. There is a 
third quantity, a third angle, the data entered into the column 
headed labor force, that is, how many people there are at a 
productive age. The level of employment or unemployment is 
gauged on the labor force, not on the size of a country's 
population. If there is a voluntary decline in employment, then 
unemployment does not rise. To put it very simply -- if the 
wives of well paid businessmen leave work to take care of their 
families, this is projected into a decline in employment without 
an increase in unemployment. The participation level, which is 
the percentage of employed per number of inhabitants, was 51.2 
percent in 1989. It then fell from year to year. The 
preliminary figures for 1993 suggest 45.8 percent. That is, a 
decline by more than 5 percentage points. If you carry this 
over into quantitative figures, then this means that there are 
roughly 500,000 citizens who are not now employed, but do not 
regard themselves as unemployed. Otherwise, they would be 
looking for work, they would be applying for support, and 
unemployment would -- obviously -- be far higher, in fact three 
times higher. 
  [Martinkova] Your wife has become a member of the CEZ [Czech 
Energy Enterprises] board of directors. Are you not concerned 
about accusations of a conflict of interest? 
  [Klaus] I am concerned about accusations from all possible 
sides and about everything that I do and do not do. This is one 
of those accusations in which I am absolutely innocent and about 
which I have nothing to say. To this effect, I have to say that 
my wife is a capable, independent individual. She is an 
economist, she is an expert in finance, indeed, she has been 
dealing with these issues the whole of her professional life and 
I have nothing else to say about this. If the kind of articles 
that have now appeared continue to crop up, she will be the one 
who will feel discriminated against as a citizen of this country 
and she will ask whether she deserves to be discriminated 
against in her professional life because she is the prime 
minister's wife.

<F P=106> [STA report: "E. Stanic Should Remain Party Secretary"] </F>
  [Text] Ljubljana/Zgornje Pirnice -- At a closed session on 
Saturday [18 June], the caucus of the Slovene Christian 
Democrats [SKD] discussed the situation in the party for several 
hours and, with a special conclusion, opted in favor of the 
party's consolidation and the majority principle in 
decision-making, SKD press spokesman Valentin Hajdinjak told the 
STA news agency after the meeting. 
  The party will assert the majority rule at all levels of 
decision-making. In this way it will pursue a uniform political 
policy that shall be determined through the will of majority, 
the participants of the caucus -- which consists of party's 
executive committee, its ministers and its deputies -- decided. 
In cases where the party will not have a stance, the majority 
opinion within the club of deputies shall prevail. They also 
proposed to draw up the rules of procedure or regulations for 
the better work of the club of deputies and the party and, thus, 
fight the belief that the party is divided. 
  The participants of the caucus expressed disagreement with 
the resignation of the party's secretary general, Edvard Stanic, 
and urged him to withdraw his resignation. Stanic has taken 
time for consideration and will announce his decision at the 
session of the party council today.

  [Text] Kriva Palanka, 21 Jun -- An officer of the 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
Army was "invited" by some Serbian soldiers to come and talk on 
the border near Cupino Brdo, in the district of Kriva Palanka; 
he was then "kept" overnight at the Serbian army headquarters in 
the village of Surlica, on Serbian territory. This was 
unofficially stated by reliable sources in Kriva Palanka. On 
Sunday [19 June] morning the "captured" Macedonian officer was 
allowed to go back to the Macedonian side of the border. 
  The soldiers of the so-called Yugoslav Army who have taken 
over the strategic point of Mount Straza on Macedonian territory 
do not show any intention of leaving it, and in the meantime the 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] observers moved their 
headquarters to a safer place than Cupino Brdo -- the village of 
Podrzikonj.

[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]-Yugoslav 
border, involving usurping the place Cupino Brdo and imprisoning 
a Macedonian soldier by Serbian troops, the Macedonian Foreign 
Ministry sent a note of protest to the Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry, against such behavior of the Yugoslav Army, which 
violates the Macedonian border, creating conditions for heavy 
consequences. At the same time, the Macedonian Foreign Ministry 
demanded an urgent session of the representatives of the two 
countries' foreign ministries, to agree on undertaking steps to 
definitely determine the border line. The Macedonian side 
underlined such negotiations would present basis for development 
of mutual trust, communication, and cooperation between the two 
nations.

  [Text] Kiro Gligorov, president of the Republic of 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
gave an interview for Macedonian Television yesterday [20 June] 
on Census 94, answering questions and giving personal opinions 
and evaluations on this statistical endeavor. Following are 
some excerpts. Asked his opinion on the census, President 
Gligorov said that it was of an extreme importance, primarily as 
a chance to draw up a real map of Macedonia, the population 
count, its make-up, and what and how much of anything there is. 
In brief, he said that it was a chance to create a source for a 
lot of important data needed for a realistic examination of the 
present situation, which can be used in planning our future. 
  "I think that we have created the necessary conditions for 
carrying out such an activity, and I do not think that any of 
the sides will have any objections," President Gligorov said, 
adding that the census will help free the agenda of an issue of 
a purely statistical nature that has tended to be given 
political meaning. "Therefore, in my opinion," President 
Gligorov said, "this is a goal of essential importance for our 
state, for the stability and peace of our country." 
  Asked about the degree of politicization, in the sense of 
who 
needed the census and why, President Gligorov said that such 
politicization started being implemented right after the latest 
census in 1991, when some internal and international factors 
were involved, and most of all our neighbors. "That is not 
uncommon," Gligorov said, "if we look at the present situation 
in the Balkans, on the territories of former Yugoslavia, and the 
aspirations and historic ambitions of various countries toward 
Macedonia. Therefore, the census should put an end to such 
controversies and provide real arguments for discussions. 
Politicization, particularly the argument presented to the 
international public that far greater numbers of certain 
nationalities reside here than is actually true, conjures up an 
image where, if we add up all those pretentious numbers, 
Macedonia turns out to be a state of many millions, which 
everybody knows to be a notorious lie. After the census, 
everyone will have to face the truth." 
  The next question was related to our standards and our 
Census 
Law compared with the same regulations in Europe and the world. 
"In this feverish atmosphere among and around us, we can 
understand the manipulations of the number of certain 
nationalities. However, it is beyond understanding when some 
claim that our census is below European standards, because it is 
the only census that will be carried out according to the 
standards of the Council of Europe. This is the only such case, 
and it is good, because after the census it will be hard to deny 
the results. The census can serve as an example of how things 
could be resolved in the boiling Balkans. It means discussing 
by presenting arguments, and not historic burdens and personal 
subjective evaluations." 
  At the end, President Gligorov emphasized that the census 
was 
a possibility, as was the referendum, for our people to show 
their attitude to the state, to do their civil duties, and thus 
remove from the agenda an issue that can cause a lot of 
misunderstanding.

<F P=106> [Report by Mario Marusic: "The Croats Have Put Up Their </F>
Candidates"] 
  [Text] Mostar (from VJESNIK's correspondent) -- In 
accordance with criteria that were adopted earlier, the general 
list of Croatian candidates for members of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation Government was agreed on at the 
joint session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ [Croatian Democratic 
Community] Presidency and Executive Committee held in Mostar. 
It will, in further procedures, be coordinated at the session 
of the Chamber of Representatives of the Croatian republic of 
Herceg-Bosna, scheduled for Monday, and at the session of the 
Club of Croat Deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent 
Assembly. Furthermore, at the joint session of the highest 
bodies of the party -- which was chaired by Pero Markovic, 
president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ Executive Committee, and 
attended by Kresimir Zubak, president of the Presidential 
Council of the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna and president 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation; Mariofil Ljubic, chairman 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly; and Mile 
Akmadzic, minister for inter-republic cooperation and 
international relations in the Government of the Croatian 
republic of Herceg-Bosna -- the implementation of the Washington 
agreement and the Vienna talks on the Croat-Bosniak Federation 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina were also discussed. 
  Although there was just a brief press release, signed by 
Vice 
President Topic, referring to the list of Croat personnel 
candidates, no names were given and the "practice of forceful 
mobilization of the Croats by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army on the 
territory of the Federation controlled by the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army -- which is contrary to the spirit and the essence of 
coordinated agreements and the Federation Constitution, i.e. 
which is not contributing to the rapprochement of the Croats and 
the Bosniaks or to the established principle of the equality of 
the two constituent nations -- was condemned." Regarding that, 
the Presidency of the Executive Committee of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ "has entrusted Croat officials in the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and the Croatian republic of 
Herceg-Bosna with finding solutions, together with 
representatives of the Bosniak nation, to stop the forceful 
mobilization of the Croats, find a way to release those Croats 
who were already mobilized, and find a lasting solution to the 
matter of compulsory military service in the Federation." 
Unofficial sources have revealed the names of candidates to be 
accepted by deputies of the chamber of representatives of the 
Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna at the session scheduled for 
Monday. 
  Jadranko Prlic is the candidate for defense minister and 
deputy prime minister of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, 
Neven Tomic or Stjepo Andrijic for finance minister, Mate Tadic 
for justice minister, Stjepo Andrijic, N. Grabovac, Tvrtko 
Nevjestic, and M. Puljic are running for minister of trade, Bozo 
Ljubic and V. Simunovic for health minister, and Tvrtko 
Nevjestic, Mile Akmadzic, and N. Grabovac are running for 
minister without portfolio. Vladislav Pogarcic was put up as the 
candidate for deputy foreign minister, Jozo Leutar for deputy 
interior minister, Ivan Santic for deputy minister of industry 
and energy, Berislav Buljan for deputy minister of physical 
planning and environment, Ilija Kosulj and Bozidar Skavran for 
deputy minister of transport and communications, S. Pranjic for 
deputy minister of culture, science, and education, and Martin 
Raguz for deputy minister of social politics and refugees. 
  In addition to considering the list of Croat candidates for 
ministerial and deputy ministerial positions in the government 
of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, Ivan Bender, president of 
the Chamber of Representatives, has announced that the report on 
the course of the Geneva talks, which will again be attended by 
the Bosnian Serbs, will be on the agenda, as well as 
preparations for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Constituent Assembly, 
scheduled for 22 June in Sarajevo. Bender also said that the 
final decision on personnel candidates will be made on Monday 
and that Croat deputies will go to Sarajevo with ready-made 
solutions, so it could be expected to already establish the 
cabinet of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation on Wednesday, after 
the prime minister and deputy prime minister have been appointed.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 21 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb authorities 
blocked humanitarian and UN convoys from entering Sarajevo last 
weekend in retaliation for the Bosnian Army's offensive in the 
northeastern part of the country, a UN spokesman said Tuesday 
[21 June]. Major Rob Annink, spokesman for the UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) said all Serb checkpoints into Sarajevo, 
especially those leading to central Bosnia, were shut down from 
Friday to Monday. He said the measure did not completely 
isolate the Bosnian capital as the UN can fly in supplies and 
convoys have been using a mountain route that leads to the city 
since March. But Annink added that the Serb move was deemed 
serious enough for Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the 
commander of UN troops in Bosnia, to take up the matter Tuesday 
with the special UN envoy to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi. 
  Rose has also called for a high-level meeting between 
Bosnia's Serbs and Moslems Saturday to try and shore up an 
uneasy 11-day-old ceasefire that is showing signs of fraying. 
  The Serbs and Moslems have been locked in heavy fighting for 
five days near northeastern Mount Ozren which overlooks the 
region of Doboj, Ribnica and Gradaca. 
  Annink said UN observers deployed in the region have set up 
a 
radar to pinpoint the origin of the shelling. He said the UN 
had registered a threefold increase in ceasefire violations in 
and around Sarajevo in the last 24 hours, with one Bosnian Army 
soldier reported dead. 
  Meanwhile General Andre Soubirou, the commander of UN troops 
in Sarajevo, told reporters Tuesday that Serb troops were 
probably responsible for sniper shots over the weekend that left 
one person dead and three others injured in the capital. He 
said the shooting was apparently a reminder by the Serbs that 
despite a ceasefire imposed on the capital in February under the 
threat of a NATO strike, they still could control the city.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 22 June within its 
regular 8-minute newscast carries several reports on the 
situation in the republic. 
  A report by the 3rd Corps Press Center, read by an 
unidentified correspondent, states that "last night about 
midnight, an attack began on the defense lines of (?Zavidovici) 
units in the region of (Sjenokos). After a battle lasting one 
hour, our fighters repelled a chetnik attempt to break through, 
inflicting great losses on them." The report further states 
that "the aggressor is now shelling Zavidovici districts with 
mortars and howitzers and the actual town of Zavidovici has been 
showered with (?cluster) bombs. As a result of the shelling, 19 
civilians have been wounded, eight of them seriously, and there 
are many children among them. With equal ferocity, the 
chetniks pounded the Tesanj defenders' positions this morning. 
At unequal intervals they used howitzer and tank shells to 
pound (?Tesanj), [name indistinct], Kalosevici, [name 
indistinct], Matuzici, and Ularice. More than 30 shells have 
fallen on the town of Tesanj alone. Regrouping and the bringing 
in of chetnik reinforcements to the Tesanj-Doboj front has been 
observed." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports that "last night, the strongest 
attacks by the Serbian aggressor on defense positions since the 
latest truce were carried out on the Brcko front." Deronjic 
also says that "during the night, chetnik mortars, together with 
antiaircraft machine-guns and antiaircraft artillery were 
discharged on (Ljubici) while the central section of Brcko 
defense was being pounded by Broving guns, submachine-guns, and 
portable rocket launchers." Finally, Deronjic says that "this 
morning, the situation at the Brcko front is marked by 
provocations and intensive activity by enemy snipers, 
particularly along the Omerbegovaca-Vranovaca line." 
  Mirza Sadikovic reports from the Bihac region that "last 
night and this morning confirmed Karadzic's [word indistinct] 
that a Gorazde-type situation could be repeated in the Bihac 
region. Namely, the amassing of chetnik forces on the (Veliki) 
[name indistinct) Grmusko-Srbljansko Plateau and Grabez line has 
continued. About 1,500 enemy soldiers have already arrived on 
[words indistinct] with heavy artillery and armored vehicles."

  [Text] We have just received this report from Travnik: 
  [Unidentified correspondent] The Serbian aggressor was not 
honoring the cease-fire today either. In addition to day-long 
artillery and small arms provocations and unsuccessful attempts 
to breach our defense lines, the aggressor pounded civilian 
targets in Travnik from strongholds on Mt. Vlasic early this 
evening. Unfortunately, the victims were again civilians. 
According to the information available so far--it is now 2245-- 
three persons have lost their lives, while many more have been 
seriously or slightly wounded.

  [Text] Doboj, June 21 (TANJUG) -- Thirteen civilians, 
including five children, were seriously wounded, and many more 
received light injuries in a Moslem artillery attack on the Serb 
towns of Doboj and Teslic in northern Bosnia on Tuesday [21 
June], Bosnian Serb military sources said. The tank and rocket 
shells severely damaged civilian objects in these two 
neighbouring towns, the sources said. Moslems started shelling 
the two towns several weeks ago. 
  Continuing to violate the Geneva Accord on a cessation of 
hostilities which was reached on June 8, the Moslems heavily 
attacked also some other Serb towns, villages and positions in 
the wider area of Doboj. Southeast of Doboj, on Mt. Ozren, 
Moslems opened mortar fire on the Serb villages of Boljanic, 
Karanovac and Petrovo on the left bank of the River Spreca. 
There were no casualties, but the shell explosions caused 
severe material damage to buildings. 
  On the Vozuca front, Moslems are firing at and shelling Serb 
positions and villages along all lines of separation. A Moslem 
troop build-up has also been observed. Moslems are also 
attacking Serb positions east and west of Doboj, but Serbs are 
abiding by the Geneva Accord and open fire only when the lives 
of their troops and civilians are threatened, the Bosnian Serb 
military sources said.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoran Grgurevic from Doboj] </F>
  [Text] Muslim forces have continued to carry out intensive 
attacks on all fronts around Doboj. The fiercest attacks are 
taking place on the Ozren-Vozuca front, where the Muslims are 
trying to breach the Serbian defense lines from the direction of 
Zavidovici and Banovici and thereby link the Zenica and Tuzla 
regions. In addition to the Serbian lines, they are also 
targeting civilian settlements using shells of every caliber, 
filled with chemical agents and chlorine. In order to protect 
civilians, some 1,200 children of 1-15 years of age and over 
1,000 old and exhausted elderly people and women have been 
evacuated to Mount Ozren. The tough Serbian fighters from 
Ozren, residents of Vozuca, are in position. They are fighting 
so that their families can return home. 
  Unfortunately, among the Muslims there are also the 
so-called 
peacekeepers. The Muslims were not only satisfied with attacks 
on Vozuca. After their attacks on the Teslic front failed, they 
turned their guns on Teslic itself and have intermittently, 
every hour, been shelling the city center. They have been 
mercilessly pounding the town since this morning and using 
chemical agents. The command of the army of the Serbian 
republic in Teslic has evidence of this. The residents are in 
shelters, but the damage to property is enormous. Civilian 
casualties have fortunately been only slight. UNPROFOR [UN 
Protection Force] helicopters have been carrying out 
reconnaissance flights on the Trebava front, east of Doboj. The 
visible concentration of Muslim forces from the direction of 
Lukavac indicates that major attacks will take place there, too. 
  The fighters of the army of the Serbian republic are firmly 
holding their lines, ready to launch counterattacks if these 
attacks on the headquarters of the army of the Serbian republic 
continue. 
  This afternoon, Croats, the 110th Brigade of the Croatian 
Defense Council from Tesanj, attacked the city center of Doboj, 
forcing guests visiting from the Athens district of (Halgoris), 
Doboj's twin town, to take refuge in shelters. The shells, 
which are still landing on the town, have wounded three 
civilians, one seriously.

in Lokve on the southern part of the Vozuca front, and Jugovac 
and Glavica on the eastern part of the same front. However,

from this direction. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Petrovac, 21 Jun (TANJUG) -- Radio Velkaton of 
Velika Kladusa this evening denied claims made last night by 
Muslim Radio Sarajevo that forces loyal to Alija Izetbegovic had 
arrived at the perimeter of the Agrokomerc agricultural complex, 
that they were successfully advancing towards Polje and Velika 
Kladusa, and that Fikret Abdic had "disappeared in an unknown 
direction." Radio Velkaton said that the army of the Autonomous 
Province of Western Bosnia is firmly in control of all 
separation lines and that Izetbegovic's forces "will never make 
it to Velika Kladusa." 
  The same source said that "the remnants of the 5th Corps" of 
the Muslim army loyal to Alija Izetbegovic this afternoon 
continued their fierce attacks against positions and civilian 
targets in the autonomous province of western Bosnia and added 
that the heaviest infantry clashes and mortar exchanges are 
taking place in the Caglica, Todorovo, and Pecigrad areas. 
According to the radio, these attacks were repelled without 
loss. 
  Radio Velkaton claims that units of the 5th Corps are 
regrouping and redeploying, which means that there will be no 
peace in this region for a long time to come.

  [Text] Zenica, Bosnia-Herzegovina, June 21 (AFP) -- A 
steady stream of convoys have been carrying large amounts of 
weapons through Croatia to Bosnia's Moslem-led army, fueling the 
latest offensives against Serb forces, UN and other sources 
said. In violation of the international arms embargo against 
the Bosnian belligerents, trucks loaded with light arms, 
anti-tank weapons and ammunition have been leaving the Croatian 
coast regularly for Bosnia since a Croat-Moslem federation pact 
was agreed in March, the sources said. The agreement to form 
the federation ended a year of bloody conflict between the two 
ethnic groups. 
  The sources in Zenica, headquarters of the Moslem-led 
Bosnian 
army's Third Corps, said most of the weapons were destined for 
the Brcko corridor in northern Bosnia -- a strategic lifeline 
linking Serb-conquered territory in eastern and western Bosnia 
which UN officials fear is the next Bosnian army target. 
  The federation agreement also freed Moslem troops who had 
been deployed against the Croats to launch attacks last week on 
Serb positions in northeastern Bosnia. The Serbs have protested 
the attacks as a clear violation of a month-long ceasefire which 
started on June 10 and they began over the weekend hindering aid 
convoys into the Moslem-majority Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, in 
retaliation. 
  "Croats from both Croatia and Bosnia are letting convoys go 
through in exchange for part of their cargo," a UN Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) officer told AFP on condition he not be named. 
"They only tolerate light arms and anti-tank guns, to shift the 
balance of power in the Moslems' favour just a little, but not 
more," he said. "There's no question of heavy arms for the 
moment -- the distrust (between the Moslems and Croats) is not 
about to disappear," he said. 
  "One thing is certain, money is no object," he said. 
"Suitcases full of dollars and deutschmarks enter the country 
every day, supplied notably by Islamic countries," the UN 
officer said. 
  A Bosnian Army officer at the Third Corps headquarters here 
acknowledged that his forces lacked artillery and air power, but 
said the weapons getting through were sufficient. "Give us 
modern anti-tank weapons and we will liberate our land," he told 
AFP. 
  The Bosnian Government has long called for an end to the 
blanket arms embargo on all former Yugoslav republics, imposed 
when fighting first broke out three years ago, saying it would 
not need proposed international aid against Serb aggression if 
it could defend itself properly. 
  The Bosnian Army has a large infantry, but is not as well 
equipped in heavy weaponry as the Serbs, who had access to the 
former Yugoslav army's arsenal. A European military expert in 
the region confirmed that Moslem-Croat cooperation in this 
field, at least, was working "very well." "Convoys pass through 
Croat zones without being looted outrageously, which is what 
often happened before," he said. 
  A reliable source in Zenica said 200 tonnes of Chinese arms 
were delivered at the end of May, including Norinco Red Arrow 8 
anti-tank missiles. The arms came by air to Ancona in Italy, 
continuing by boat to Split on the Croatian coast before being 
unloaded onto 34 trucks, he said. 
  The convoy, fronted by four truckloads of food and escorted 
by Croatian police, crossed into Bosnia without difficulty. It 
was then handed over to Bosnian police, continuing through 
Visoko, Tuzla and Maoca near the Brcko corridor, he said. The 
European military expert said another convoy of 50 trucks, 
probably carrying arms, was seen at the Croat town of Prozor on 
the road linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia. 
  An article appearing this weekend in the London-based JANE'S 
DEFENCE WEEKLY showed a photograph of the Red Arrow 8 missiles 
near the front at Gradacac. The missile has a range of 3,000 
metres (yards) and can pierce armour eight centimetres (around 
three inches) thick.

  [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, June 19 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav 
Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said Sunday that U.N. Envoy 
Yasushi Akashi's statement, in which he said that the U.N. would 
pursue a "stick and carrot" policy towards the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia, confirmed that some members of the world 
organization were pursuing a partial policy. 
  The countries represented on the Contact Group for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina have a great responsibility not to allow to 
be drawn again into the trap of partiality and belief that they 
could achieve something by pursuing the "stick and carrot" 
policy, Jovanovic said in a radio interview broadcast from 
Kragujevac in central Serbia. 
  Referring to hints that the new maps for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
territorial division would be submitted to the warring sides as 
an ultimatum, Jovanovic said that this was not yet clear and 
that everybody should wait. 
  However, if it would be merely a continuation of the earlier 
policy of favouring the Bosnian Moslems and Croats and punishing 
the Serbs, then it would obviously not lead to any results, 
Jovanovic said. 
  The Contact Group is soon expected to present the maps for 
Bosnia's division, according to which 51 percent of the 
territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would go to the Moslem-Croat 
federation and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.

  [Text] Belgrade, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- "The report that the 
Albanian authorities have tried forcibly to resettle members of 
the Serb and Montenegrin minorities, residents of Vraka and 
Podgoricani, from the villages of Stari Boric and Mladi Boric, 
in which they have always lived, has caused great concern among 
the Yugoslav public. According to available information, the 
Albanian authorities tried to confiscate by force their houses 
and land, and move them to different locations," reads a 
statement by the Federal Foreign Ministry, which was forwarded 
to TANJUG today. 
  ``What is particularly worrying is that the Albanian police 
used force and wounded several people, including women and 
children. All this has caused serious concern among members of 
the Serb and Montenegrin minorities and the Gorans [Slav ethnic 
minority], because this is yet further confirmation of the 
increasing pressure and the unwillingness on the part of the 
Albanian authorities to grant and respect the national 
minorities' inalienable right to their territory. 
  ``The Federal Foreign Ministry notes with concern the fact 
that Albania is forcibly resettling members of the Serb and 
Montenegrin minorities under the pretext of a new administrative 
division of state territory, and is planning to settle Albanians 
from the areas of Dukadjin and Malesija to farms belonging to 
the Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans. This is a calculated policy 
aimed at breaking up the territorial integrity of the ethnic 
Serbs, Montenegrins and Gorans in Albania, especially in the 
territory near the Yugoslav-Albanian border, and exerting 
increased physical and psychological pressure in order to speed 
up their systematic assimilation. 
  ``By such action the Albanian authorities are violating 
basic 
human and civil rights, the right to physical integrity, the 
freedom to choose the place of abode and the inviolability of 
private property, which is in contravention of its obligations 
assumed as a member of the United Nations and the CSCE. 
  ``The Federal Foreign Ministry calls on the Albanian 
authorities to stop exerting pressure on members of the Serb and 
Montenegrin national minorities and the Gorans, and to abandon 
its plan forcibly to resettle the residents of Vraka and 
Podgoricani. The Federal Foreign Ministry expects Albania to 
respect all rights of members of the Serb and Montenegrin 
minorities in line with relevant CSCE documents,'' the statement 
says in conclusion.

<F P=106> [Article by Milenko Pesic: "Concerning Support for </F>
Strengthening the Federal State: Is Centralization Possible in 
the FRY?"] 
  [Text] Slobodan Rakitic, DEPOS [Democratic Movement of 
Serbia]: "The federal state has too few authorities"; 
academician Miodrag Jovicic: "A two-member federation has no 
chance of succeeding"; Dr. Pavle Nikolic: "For a unified state 
of Serbs and Montenegrins." 
  Time will tell what the future of Djindjic's idea on the 
need 
to centralize Yugoslavia is. The opposition offered in 
Montenegro to his support for strengthening the federal state 
was more than vehement. 
  Responding to charges by the Montenegrin political public, 
Zoran Djindjic said: "I do not challenge the fact that 
Montenegro has its own statehood and its own symbols and 
sovereignty. However, some questions concerning money and the 
economy must be separated out. There is no equality if someone 
gives 10 dinars and someone else gives 20 dinars, and then they 
have an equal voice in deciding how that money is going to be 
used." 
<H5>  Djindjic in a Rush </H5>
  Many people feel that the disintegration of the SFRY 
[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] first began in the 
monetary sphere. As soon as the stories of who was exploiting 
whom and who was making decisions about money began circulating, 
post-World War II Yugoslavia signed its own death sentence. 
  Two years in the life of the third Yugoslavia as a 
two-member 
federation have been enough to show that not everything in the 
new federal state is functioning smoothly. 
  Slobodan Rakitic, leader of the DEPOS caucus in the Federal 
Assembly, agrees that the federal state has too few authorities. 
  "This is evidenced by the fact that sessions of the two 
chambers of the Federal Assembly are very rare, while 
announcements that the federal government has not prepared bills 
for the legislature are very common. Legislative activities have 
been sharply curtailed, to the benefit of the 
member-states--Serbia and Montenegro," says Rakitic. 
  Rakitic feels that Djindjic was right when he raised the 
question of the competence of the federal state and its 
influence on the political and economic life of the citizens, 
"if one does not want this present-day state to resemble the one 
portrayed in the 1974 Constitution." 
  "Nevertheless, I think that Djindjic has rushed the whole 
story. It would be nice if we as a state could deal with these 
problems now," the head of the DEPOS caucus in the federal 
parliament warns. 
  The current federation has no chance of succeeding, 
academician Miodrag Jovicic believes. 
  "There are three reasons why the FRY [Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia] cannot be effective as a federative state," this 
expert in constitutional law explains. 
  First, the theory and practice of federalism show that 
two-member federations have no chance of succeeding. As his 
second argument, Jovicic cites the differences between Serbia 
and Montenegro in terms of size and economic power; finally, 
there is the Zabljak Constitution, which contains a number of 
weaknesses and numerous confederal elements that were present in 
the former SFRY. 
<H5>  Way Out of Current Situation </H5>
  As a strong critic of the current constitutional solution 
for 
the FRY, Jovicic warns that the supreme legal document grants 
privileges to Montenegro in a number of regards. 
  "There are two ways out of the current situation. One is to 
abolish the current republican and provincial borders and form a 
state of regions. Such a solution would be somewhere between a 
unitary and federal structure for the state," Jovicic 
emphasizes, adding that he is opposed to a unitary state. 
  Jovicic sees another possibility for overcoming the current 
discord between the two members of the federation in granting 
Montenegro special autonomous status, so-called corpum 
separatum, like what the Banovina of Croatia gained in 1939. 
"That means that Montenegro would no longer have its own 
constitution and president," says academician Jovicic. 
  Dr. Pavle Nikolic, a professor at the School of Law and 
federal deputy, also says that the current two-member federation 
is untenable as a solution, because it does not ensure the equal 
rights of the federal units and the equal rights of its citizens. 
  "The two-member federation is fertile ground for sovereignty 
disputes and rivalries, which always bring forth aspirations 
toward confederalism on the one hand and centralism on the other 
hand," Nikolic stresses. 
  Despite the unification of Serbia and Montenegro in 1918, 
the 
post-World War II arrangement, and the constitutional solution 
of 1974, these two states have grown apart over the course of 
time, emphasizing their statehood and sovereignty. 
  "I support a unified state of Serbs and Montenegrins with 
divided democratic-political territorial autonomy, as a 
community of the Serbian and Montenegrin states. Through this 
sort of renunciation of statehood by Serbia and Montenegro, the 
basis for creating a unified statehood of the entire nation 
would be created," Nikolic believes, adding that this would 
avoid centralism, which is inherently undemocratic.

  [Excerpts] Belgrade, 17 Jun (TANJUG) -- The dinar exchange 
rate and prices are stable, and hard currency black marketeering 
is an ephemeral phenomenon, Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic 
stressed at a news conference today. 
  There is no danger of the dinar falling in relation to the 
German mark, Kontic said, adding that prices did not rise last 
week. 
  A total price rise of 0.8 percent was recorded between 24 
January and 11 June, but that period saw an unacceptable rise in 
the price of agricultural produce and services, Kontic said, and 
pointed to the need for a further reduction in prices, 
especially for certain products. [passage omitted] 
  Despite statistical indicators that there was a fall in 
production in May, Kontic said that industrial production has 
seen a 3 percent rise in relation to April, of course, excluding 
the production of energy, which accounts for one-fifth of 
production, and which fell in that period. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, June 22 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslavia's 
industrial production has doubled since an economic economic 
reform programme was launched in late January. Industry, apart 
from the power industry, had a growth index of 205 per cent in 
the January-to-May period. The figures for May, for the first 
time in three months, show a certain drop in the industrial 
production growth -- 6.8 per cent below the figure for April -- 
but still a rise of 3.9 per cent. Central Bank Governor 
Dragoslav Avramovic, architect of the economic recovery and 
monetary reconstruction programme, describes the results as a 
remarkable success. "We may be proud, all the more so because 
this comes after last year's total monetary collapse and in 
conditions of sanctions," says Avramovic. The U.N. Security 
Council clamped strict economic sanctions on Yugoslavia on May 
30, 1992. The industrial output dropped by 20 per cent in 1992 
as against 1991 and by a further 37.3 per cent in 1993. "Credit 
for the revival of production goes primarily to the banks, which 
have been operating and giving loans in the worst of economic 
conditions," says Avramovic. As a result, most banks are 
grappling with the problem of insolvency, and the federal 
government and the Cental Bank will soon be taking steps to 
consolidate the banks' position, he explains.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 20 (TANJUG)--Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic, French General Pierre-Marie Gallois and 
Greek poet and journalist Dimitris Analis condemned here Monday 
the biased media reports on the causes and protagonists of the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia. 
  The media war, which is undoubtedly being waged against our 
country, had helped dismember former Yugoslavia, Milosevic said 
during a talk with Gallois and Analis, who also comes from 
France where he currently lives, the presidential office said in 
a statement. 
  Milosevic and his guests, who are on a several-day visit to 
Yugoslavia at the invitation of the Yugoslav Government, agreed 
that it was a primary moral duty of all conscientious 
intellectuals to stand up against such manipulation with public 
opinion. 
  Gallois expressed to President Milosevic his support for the 
efforts Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are making 
to secure a stable peace in the territory of former Yugoslavia. 
  The French general, a prominent fighter against fascism in 
the Second World War and former chief of the French General 
Staff, also expressed his strong disagreement with the policy of 
pressures and sanctions of the international community against 
the Serbian people. 
  The resoluteness of Serbia and its citizens to persist in 
protecting their legitimate interests set an example to the 
countries which strive to equality-based relations among states 
and peoples and which are determined to defend their freedom and 
independence, the guests from France said. 
  The statement said Gallois and Analis had promised Milosevic 
to continue to openly urge the affirmation of truth on the 
crisis in former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Article by Lj. Milisavljevic: "Shortcuts in Transformation </F>
of Social Ownership: Labor Unions Fighting for Property"] 
  [Text] Labor union organizations are stockholders at 
"Univerzal," "Metalservis," the "Institute for Foreign 
Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic," "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and 
"Jugostroj"; comments on 57 articles of the republic's law on 
transformation. 
  The labor union organizations at seven major Belgrade 
enterprises have become stockholders. They have been helped in 
this by an expert team from the Council of the Federation of 
Independent Labor Unions [VSSS] of Belgrade, which in 
anticipation of a new law in the republic is actively monitoring 
the transformation taking place at 75 percent of the city's 
enterprises and insisting that all employees enjoy equal rights 
in purchasing stock. 
  The unions at "Univerzal" DD, "Metalservis" DD, the 
"Institute for Foreign Languages," "IPM," "David Pajic," 
"Belgrade" Shoe Industry, and "Jugostroj" have become holders of 
stock shares. 
<H5>  Fight for Equal Rights for Employees </H5>
  "At our firm, 100 percent of the capital is the property of 
workers, while a small part is held by the union itself. Like 
all the other stockholders, the union too received 0.025 percent 
of the capital," says Toma Stanic, president of the "Univerzal" 
union. According to him, this is the first union organization in 
Serbia to become a stockholder. 
  At "Belgrade" Shoe Industry, 30 percent of the capital that 
has been sold thus far is owned by that enterprise's labor union. 
  The transformation of ownership is complete at 2,468 
enterprises in Serbia. Employees at another 900 firms are 
awaiting confirmation that they have conducted transformation 
correctly. There are a total of 1,800 enterprises in Belgrade, 
while the process of changing ownership is taking place at 1,350 
firms. 
  However, transformation is not proceeding smoothly at all 
firms. At the initiative of labor unions, this process has been 
halted over the past year at "Posavina" in Obrenovac, at the 
"Dunav" transport enterprise in Belgrade, at "Metalservis," at 
"Dzi-ti" in Zemun, and at "Projeks" (part of the former 
"Prosveta"). 
  "In August 1992, we demanded changes in the Serbian law on 
transformation. Among other things, we asked that 51 percent of 
the stock be at a discount (so-called workers shares) as well as 
vouchers (free shares) for all employees," explains economist 
Tanja Nikolic of the Belgrade union. "Since not one of the 
demands was adopted, we advocated that the law be implemented 
consistently and that the equal rights of all employees at the 
enterprise be respected, because the aim of certain--most often 
managerial--groups was to gain a controlling interest over the 
stock," says Tanja Nikolic. 
<H5>  Rest Homes for Labor Unions </H5>
  According to Bogoljub Mitrovic, vice chairman of the Council 
of the Federation of Independent Labor Unions of Belgrade, the 
city's labor union has taken the transformation problem 
seriously and formed a team of experts that is qualified and 
educated in the type of transformation that is most suitable to 
employees. 
  "There is a federal law that allows transformation on the 
basis of the bookkeeping value of the property and payment over 
10 years, and a republican one based on an estimate of the 
social capital. We are not satisfied with either one of these 
two laws and are aware that transformation based on them does 
not increase the capital of the enterprises, but that 
transformation of social ownership with changes in 
administrative roles increases the efficiency of decisionmaking 
and business on the one hand, while on the other hand inhibiting 
the sale of the social capital that has been built up over five 
decades." 
  A new law on transformation is being prepared in Serbia. The 
VSSS has submitted its own proposals and opinions. 
  "We provided comments on 57 articles of the existing law. 
The 
extent to which they are considered by the legislature does not 
depend on us very much, because we do not have our own 
representatives in parliament, not even a so-called `free 
seat,'" says Mitrovic. 
  One of the proposals by the Belgrade labor union is that 
worker rest homes and communal dining facilities be omitted from 
the estimate of the total value of an enterprise's capital and 
that they be turned over to the union organizations for their 
use and administration. The belief at the city's labor union is 
that no one should be allowed to turn these facilities, which 
were built with employee contributions, into private bars.

  [Text] Podgorica, 18 Jun (TANJUG) -- Significant headway 
has been achieved in the talks conducted by the Montenegrin 
delegation in Great Britain, because there is a growing 
awareness that the policy of sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia and Montenegro is pointless, Montenegrin 
Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic said in his assessment of the 
Montenegrin delegation's visit to Great Britain. The delegation 
returned to Podgorica yesterday evening. 
  The stands of the international community -- primarily the 
European Union -- on the futility of the policy of sanctions, 
which have, in a way, been conveyed to the Montenegrin 
delegation will, according to Djukanovic, encourage a flurry of 
activity leading to the establishment of peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, after which the sanctions against the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will be alleviated. 
  Assessing the talks in Great Britain as extremely useful and 
interesting, the Montenegrin prime minister stressed that it had 
been mutually noted that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina is of 
paramount importance, and that this will be followed by all 
other moves on the part of the international community. 
  Respect was also voiced toward the principled policies 
pursued by Montenegro, both in the sense of searching for a 
solution in the region of former Yugoslavia and of normalizing 
the situation in the entire area, Djukanovic said. He attaches 
great importance to the fact that, by making this visit, 
Montenegro's foreign policy, which does carry a certain amount 
of weight in the eyes of the international community, has 
announced the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "First Day of Trial Against 14 </F>
Albanians in Prishtina" -- issued by the Democratic League of 
Kosova] 
  [Text] The trial against 14 Albanians accused of "hostile 
activity" against the self-proclaimed Yugoslavia resumed 
yesterday at the Serbian-run District Court in Prishtina, 
today's BUJKU reports. The 14 Albanians have been charged of 
having allegedly set up the Defense Ministry of the Republic of 
Kosova. They are accused of two criminal offenses -- 
"association for hostile activity" and "endangering of 
territorial integrity," in compliance with Articles 136 and 116 
of the Criminal Code of "FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]." 
  The accused: Hajzer Hajzeraj (1943), Haxhi Ferati (1949), 
Zaim Berisha (1949), Ejup Dragaj, Agim Krasniqi (1956), former 
army officers: Ibush Kelmendi (1952), Halit Rama (1949), Xhelil 
Rama (1940), former officers of the Territorial Defense: Sali 
Gitaku (1937), Bilall Syla (1965), Heset Sahiti (1959), Adem 
Salihaj (1950), Sylejman Hasani (1945), and Ismajl Hehmeti 
(1945) were brought in the court-room hand-cuffed. 
  The trial was interrupted on April 18, as the lawyers had 
lodged a request for the exclusion of the public prosecutor, 
Miodrag Brklac, and his deputy, Jovica Jovanovic. 
  All the accused were detained during September last year, 
and 
according to their lawyers they have all been tortured during 
the investigation procedure. 
  During the first day of trial two of the accused were 
cross-examined. Hajzer Hajzeraj, the alleged "defense minister" 
described the torture he underwent during the detention period. 
He denied the accusation and all the statements that were 
obtained from him under pressure and torture by the police and 
security. 
  Haxhi Ferati said in his defense that everything in the 
accusation was false. He also said he had been severely 
tortured while in detention and that confessions had been taken 
from him by force. The trial is to continue tomorrow.

  [Text] According to the Democratic Community of Hungarians 
in Vojvodina [VMDK], the Hungarian political leadership can also 
be blamed for the VMDK's crisis. The VMDK Presidium's 
communique says that following the financial scandal that broke 
out some months ago, the Hungarians in Vojvodina have got into 
an unprecedented political crisis. There are also external 
reasons, namely leading Hungarian politicians, in the background 
of the crisis, the document reads. According to the VMDK 
leaders, some powerful people of the Hungarian Government made 
the financial support aimed for the Vojvodina Hungarians subject 
to a demonstration of party loyalty. The aim of the Hungarian 
Government politicians was to line up the VMDK, too, among the 
supporters of the Budapest coalition.

<F P=106> [Report by Edward Krzemien: "Facing Government Alone; </F>
Olechowski Suspending His Resignation Until July?"] 
  [Text]To prevent losing access to diplomatic posts 
for their party colleagues, the whole government is rejecting a 
reform of the Foreign Affairs Ministry [MSZ] proposed by Foreign 
Minister Olechowski. In the meantime, the minister is not 
giving up. 
  That is why the conflict between the MSZ and the government, 
which has been concealed for some time, erupted anyway. 
Yesterday the Council of Ministers rejected the draft of a new 
MSZ statute which attempted to divide the ministry into a 
political and a civilian part. Debate on the draft by the 
Office of the Council of Ministers [URM] has been pending for 
almost two months. 
  Two weeks ago, GAZETA WYBORCZA reported that a delay in the 
decision may lead to a resignation by Foreign Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski, who denied the reports while hoping for an agreement 
with URM. 
  But the Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party 
coalition regarded its control over MSZ as more important. 
According to the coalition's chief politicians, the reform 
being proposed by Olechowski permanently forecloses access for 
the coalition to posts in this prestigious ministry. 
  It is a decision that I cannot accept -- an angered 
Olechowski told reporters. I failed to obtain the support of 
any minister during today's session. When asked whether, in 
this situation, he still rules out his dismissal, Olechowski 
refused to answer: The foreign minister's position is such that 
if he is a responsible and diligent man, then he cannot go 
around talking about a resignation any time he pleases. And 
then he ended the discussion in an even more determined manner: 
We are in a period of intensive international measures which in 
my view are of historical importance. So I refuse to answer 
such questions at all. 
  As we found out unofficially from a very well-informed 
source, if it were not for the upcoming visit by U.S. President 
Clinton to Warsaw on 6 and 7 July, Olechowski would not have 
hesitated to submit an ostentatious resignation yesterday. But 
if he fails to come to an agreement with Pawlak and the 
coalition in the near future, the question of resignation will 
be just a question of time. 
  The debate is to be continued and decisions should be made 
in 
June or July, not later than that -- Olechowski said. I regard 
the July deadline as a borderline one, and a further delay of 
the reforms would be very hard for me to accept. When asked by 
a reporter what he meant by "borderline deadline," Olechowski 
replied: It means what you just heard. After July, comes August.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on results of the 19 June local elections in Poland, 
from media sources monitored by Warsaw Bureau. 
<H5>  Recap of Election Results, Geographical Distribution </H5>
  Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish on 21 June in a page 1 
article devoted to the local election results reports that there 
is no decisive winner in the self-government elections. Among 
the parties that won majorities of the mandates, are the Freedom 
Union (UW), the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and some 
right-wing coalitions. On 20 June, the State Electoral 
Commission obtained results from 36 out of the 50 existing 
voivodships (large administrative units). The average turnout 
was 36 percent, and it was higher in rural areas (38.5 percent) 
than in municipalities (29.2 percent). The highest turnout was 
recorded in Leszno and Poznan Voivodships (43, and 42 percent, 
respectively), while the lowest turnout was in Lomza, Gorzow, 
and Slupsk (23-24 percent). GAZETA WYBORCZA states that "In the 
majority of big cities, there are no definite winners, but SLD, 
the right wing, and UW, predominate. The Confederation for an 
Independent Poland (KPN), the Union of Labor (UP), and the 
Polish Peasant Party (PSL) scored poor results. SLD gained the 
largest number of mandates in 17 voivodship cities. That was 
the case in Lodz, Kalisz, Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Suwalki, 
Koszalin, Slupsk, Legnica, Szczecin, Radom, Kielce, Ciechanow, 
Bydgoszcz, Sieradz, Ostroleka, Plock, and Zielona Gora." GAZETA 
WYBORCZA reports that "Right-wing parties gained the largest 
number of votes in six voivodship capitals: Bialystok, Lomza, 
Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin. UW won in six voivodship 
cities: Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Krakow, Bielsko-Biala, and 
Wroclaw. PSL does not count in big cities. KPN was defeated in 
places where it did not form a coalition with the center 
right-wing. UP also received poor results." The daily adds that 
"The conclusion from election arithmetic is that the winners 
will be in power on their own only in a small number of cities, 
and therefore coalitions will be required almost everywhere." 
<H5>  Politicians Comment </H5>
  RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June reports on page 2 that in cities, 
the number of voters was generally lower than in rural gminas 
(small administrative units), and the low turnout is bound to 
have an impact on the composition of future councils. According 
to politicians, only the most disciplined voters and those with 
clear political values, decided to vote on 19 June. The daily 
notes that according to UW's Henryk Wujec, supporters of SLD and 
PSL are the most disciplined members of the electorate. Wujec 
also says that the two parties have enough money, as well as the 
appropriate structures to conduct elections, enabling them to 
partially regain the positions they had lost in the 1990 
elections. But that does not mean that it will be easy for PSL 
or SLD to establish gmina councils, since their prevalence is 
not that big. As for UW, it won the elections in the cities, 
which is where it has always enjoyed high support. 
RZECZPOSPOLITA quotes Wujec: "The voters were deprived of 
information regarding the meaning of the elections themselves, 
as well as the candidates. That is the reason for the low 
turnout. Among others, this demonstrates that society does not 
feel like a participant in a democratic system." According to 
the paper, PSL's Dobrosz describes the low turnout in cities as 
follows: "It means that 70 percent of society does not want to 
bear responsibility for power sharing. It is a very bad trend 
that should be understood as a vote of no confidence for 
everybody." 
  The 21 June edition of ZYCIE WARSZAWY on page 3 cites SLD's 
Aleksander Kwasniewski who points out that his party is "quite 
satisfied, having obtained 10 times more councillors than we had 
before the elections." Kwasniewski adds: "The trend from the 
parliamentary elections, was maintained." The daily notes that 
according to Pawel Piskorski, a member of the UW Presidium, "the 
post-"Solidarity" parties did not repeat their mistake from the 
parliamentary elections -- they were united this time." 
Kazimierz Ujazdowski of the Conservative Coalition -- which ran 
in the elections under "Alliance for Poland" -- describes the 
elections as a "success." "The right wing has its natural, 
substantial electorate, and when united, it scores a success," 
Ujazdowski notes. In his view, the turnout was better in towns, 
with their efficiently functioning municipal councils. Romuald 
Szeremietiew of the Movement for the Republic expresses the view 
that the local elections should strengthen some uniting 
tendencies present in the right-wing camp. He is glad the 
elections had "a political character" and that those 
unassociated with political parties were not successful; he sees 
this as "a good future sign for Polish democracy." 
  ZYCIE WARSZAWY continues its report, pointing out that 
Rafal Zienkiewicz, a representative of the Union for Real 
Politics, is less enthusiastic about the election results, which 
"did improve the party's standing but did not meet its 
expectations." He is surprised by the low turnout among the 
young generation, and he maintains that none of the existing 
parties are able to "win people's souls." "We need new faces in 
politics, and a new vision for Poland," says Zienkiewicz. 
<H5>  Newspapers Comment </H5>
  GAZETA WYBORCZA on 21 June carries a page 1 editorial by 
editor in chief Adam Michnik. Michnik notes that "local 
governments have slipped out of the control of the ruling 
coalition comprised of SLD and PSL." Since there is no decisive 
winner, everything now depends on who will enter into what kind 
of arrangement with whom. Michnik places major responsibility 
on UW's behavior in seeking coalition partners for itself, 
stating: "Everything depends on UW, and on whether it is able to 
find the best partners in the right- or left- wing bloc, since 
only UW is in a position to talk to both sides." Michnik also 
stresses that "specific issues and pragmatism, as well as 
persistently rational programs and real abilities, must outweigh 
ideological arguments" in the process of forming the 
newly-elected self-governments. 
  RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June on page 2 under the "Observations" 
rubric carries a commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska noting that in 
the elections, party tickets prevailed over coalitions of 
residents, self-governmental activists, and citizens' groups. 
According to Wawrzewska, there could be several possible 
reasons for such an occurrence: A weak self-government 
mentality or a poor understanding of the essence of local 
authorities as opposed to central authorities, clear trends 
toward a centralization of the state demonstrated by the 
governing coalition, social disappointment with those 
self-government structures that have been in office thus far, or 
finally, a lack of clarity regarding the present situation, the 
programs, or of who is who in the political scene. Wawrzewska 
predicts that the parties forming the governing coalition will 
gain the largest number of mandates but she also notes one 
important difference between these elections and the September 
1993 elections: This time, the victory will not be as 
overwhelming since the right wing has now marked its presence 
much more clearly. It is possible that in forming the various 
coalitions, right-wing parties drew the proper conclusion from 
last year's defeat when each right-wing party ran separately. 
Wawrzewska also notes that UW most probably confirmed its place 
on the political scene -- despite unclear programs and ambiguous 
behavior -- while UP's poor results are a real surprise, 
especially since it proclaims itself to be a "modern left-wing" 
party. 
  TRYBUNA on 21 June carries on pages 1 and 2 an article by 
Dr. 
Jacek Raciborski, a Warsaw University sociologist, where he 
notes: "It can be presumed preliminarily, that both the 
coalition and the opposition electorates have demobilized 
themselves by quite equal parts. This is demonstrated by the 
configuration of votes in Warsaw, which was similar to those of 
the parliamentary elections." Dr. Raciborski believes that "The 
election campaign was not intensive enough, there was not enough 
civic education to mobilize people to participate in the 
elections. But one must also emphasize the weak reflection of 
the configuration of the political scene in the social 
mentality. In addition, local councils are not perceived as 
important elements of the power structure. It is part of the 
crisis in citizen mentality. "I suppose the coalition will 
strengthen its position in many cities but it will fail to gain 
a dominant influence over local councils. In my view, the 
coalition will lose the elections, for instance, in the 
Malopolska region. Regional authorities will not be a direct 
reflection of the Sejm arrangement," adds Dr. Raciborski.

<F P=106> [Article by Agata Nowakowska: "Powerful President; </F>
Constitution According to Belvedere, Senate, and KPN"] 
  [Text] A merry-go-round of constitutional drafts has 
been set in motion in the Sejm. Sejm deputies and senators of 
the Constitutional Commission familiarized themselves yesterday 
with three of the six constitutional drafts. 
  Today the commission will debate the remaining three drafts: 
a joint draft coming from the Polish Peasant Party and the 
Union of Labor, one from the Democratic Left Alliance, and one 
introduced by the Freedom Union. 
<H5>  Belvedere Draft </H5>
  Lech Walesa wants a strong presidency -- the president would 
be able to dissolve the Sejm at almost any time. He would only 
not be able to do so if the Sejm were less than one year old 
(unless during that time, the Sejm deputies fail to adopt a 
budget) or within six months of the end of the presidential term. 
  The president would be entitled to issue decrees, but only 
with consent from the Sejm. In case parliament is dissolved, 
the president would be able to issue decrees as he pleases. 
  The president would lead the government, he would appoint 
and 
dismiss the prime minister, and he would appoint and dismiss 
ministers on the prime minister's motion. The Sejm would not be 
empowered to do a lot regarding the government's composition -- 
all it would be able to do is hold a confidence vote in the 
government. 
  The president would be commander in chief of the Armed 
Forces; among other posts, he would appoint the chief of the 
General Staff. He would also "supervise" the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry and the Internal Affairs Ministry. The president is 
full of energy but he is not empowered to do much -- argued Lech 
Falandysz, a minister at the Belvedere. 
<H5>  Draft of Senate and KPN </H5>
  These drafts also provide that it would be the president who 
would be playing a decisive role in appointing the prime 
minister, whom members of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland [KPN] call a chancellor [kanclerz]. Both drafts endow 
the president with the right to issue decrees. 
  According to Alicja Grzeskowiak of the Center Accord, the 
Senate draft refers to a "coherent system of values based on 
Christianity." The draft begins with the words: "In the name of 
God Almighty," it envisions a Concordat with the Vatican, it 
guarantees the right to life from the moment of conception, 
religious lessons in schools ("every legally recognized religion 
may be the subject of school teaching"), and it prohibits the 
death penalty. 
  The KPN draft creates privileges for the Roman Catholic 
Church: "The Roman Catholic religion, being the religion of an 
overwhelming majority of the nation, occupies a leading position 
among religions having equal rights in the Republic of Poland." 
  KPN members want Sejm terms to be numbered, beginning with 
the general Sejm session held in Piotrkow in 1493. Sejm 
deputies and senators would not be allowed to read their 
speeches from notes, but they would be entitled to free travel 
on public transportation. 
  All presidential candidates born after 1990 would have to 
have higher education, while candidates for Sejm deputies, 
mayors of towns and cities, and chief officers of groups of 
villages would have to have at least a high school diploma.

<F P=106> [Article by M. C.: The Generals' Offensive] </F>
  [Text] The reform of the Polish command structures of the 
armed forces was completed in the middle of last year. It turned 
out that, in the close-knit command structure, there is room for 
four civilians (the minister and deputy ministers responsible 
for education, foreign affairs, and what is called logistics) 
and only one general, i.e., the chief of the General Staff. 
Almost all of the institutions that had an influence on the 
Army, including the military intelligence services, were located 
in the civilian structures of MON [Ministry of National 
Defense]. The General Staff became virtually just an executive 
agency. The generals feel that, at that time, the Army was 
without leadership during peacetime because it was difficult to 
regard a civilian as the head, the minister of defense. 
  After the elections in 1993, the new minister of defense, 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk, suspended the organizational rules drafted 
by his predecessor, Janusz Onyszkiewicz. A considerable portion 
of the responsibility for the Army was transferred to the 
General Staff. At present, it [the General Staff] consists of 
four main members: the Inspectorate of Training, to which are 
subordinate, among others, the facilities for combat training, 
education, and schooling, physical training, as well as the 
military police forces, and the commanders of the branches of 
forces; the Logistics Inspectorate; the Department of Strategic 
Planning; and the Department of Organization-Mobilization. The 
General Staff also includes the special services, i.e., 
intelligence and military counterintelligence. At the same time, 
the jurisdiction of the previously existing civilian department 
has been curtailed considerably. A portion of the special 
services has been placed here, however. Those who support 
Onyszkiewicz's reform think that the chief of the General Staff 
has been made independent of the minister of defense inasmuch as 
(under the new disciplinary regulations) he is in charge of all 
of the servicemen also assigned to the MON structures. 
  For the present, however, there is no legal document that 
would eliminate the supreme authority of the Minister of 
National Defense. This may happen in the future when a general 
(the commander of the Armed Forces) is subordinate to the 
president alone. Several plans exist for a new supreme command, 
i.e., the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces. Along with 
each of them, the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces 
(before the war, an institution by the same name existed, whose 
head answered only to the president) will be composed of three 
inspectorates (ground forces, air forces and air defense, and 
the navy), as well as the General Staff, with considerably 
smaller jurisdiction than it has currently.

<F P=106> [Article by K.P.: "The Situation in the Grain and Meat </F>
Industries; We Await a Correction"] 
  [Text] This year we will continue to feel the effects of 
the breakdown in animal husbandry in 1993. A growth in meat 
production is not expected until the beginning of next year. The 
situation in grain processing is also difficult. 
  During the first three years of economic reform, we 
harvested 
27-28 million metric tons of grain each year. Grain and grain 
product prices remained relatively stable until early 1992. 
Despite the fact that growth indicators of these prices were 
half the rate of inflation, this had no definite negative effect 
on this sector, primarily due to the size of turnovers (hog 
production rose, and large quantities of grain were imported). 
  In 1992, grain production dropped to 20 million tons, and, 
at 
the same time, during the course of one year, their prices 
almost tripled. The following year brought an increase in grain 
production (to 23.5 million tons), while the size of animal 
production dropped. A state of relative price and production 
stability developed. Present grain prices are about 15 percent 
lower than in the spring of last year. Experts in the Agency for 
Agricultural Marketing (ARR) are forecasting that, after the 
1994 harvest, they will drop still more. 
  Domestic consumption demand has little effect on the 
stability of the grain market. It remains at a steady 115-120 kg 
per capita per year. The growth rate of grain product prices is 
not only lower than the rate of inflation, but it is also lower 
than the price growth of grain itself. An additional factor that 
helps to maintain this situation is the rather high (82.2 
thousand tons in 1993) import of flour. 
  The fact that prices of grain and grain products are not 
keeping up with inflation is responsible for the steady 
reduction in the processing margin. The stability of grain 
prices between harvests means, in turn, that almost no advantage 
is being taken of the seasonal differences between them. The 
storage margin category (with fixed costs rising greatly and 
warehousing costs varying) is almost disappearing. The State 
Grain Elevators (PZZ) are not able to make a profit at this time 
and thus accumulate funds for either development or turnovers. 
Nor did they have these funds previously when, on principle, 
they were not enterprises created for profit. However, as a 
result of decisions made on higher levels, they were entangled 
in investment ventures and thus encumbered with high credit 
payments. Their debt, by virtue of this, is approximately 90 
billion zlotys [Z]. Nor does the PZZ benefit from any credits in 
grain procurement. The debt attributed to this totals Z250 
billion. 
  The process of ownership transformation in the grain-milling 
industry was preceded by the breakup of the PZZ into smaller 
units. At this time, there are 105 state enterprises (including 
18 limited-liability companies) and two State Treasury stock 
companies. A few enterprises were privatized, and four are in 
the process of bankruptcy. 
  As ARR experts have determined, acceleration of the process 
of restructuring this sector is very difficult (a postinspection 
report from the Supreme Board of Inspection confirms that the 
situation in this industry is complicated by overall economic 
conditions as well as some internal neglect). It will have to 
wait (there is no great interest in this industry, either by 
foreign or domestic investors) for a comprehensive program of 
universal privatization. But general transformations in this 
industry will not proceed rapidly if comprehensive 
debt-reduction is not instituted. 
  Regeneration of basic herds in animal husbandry is a 
long-term measure (since the last harvests a growth in the 
number of animals has been recorded). An increase in meat 
production cannot be expected until the beginning of 1995. This 
year, production will continue to fall. It is anticipated that, 
compared with 1993, there will be 17 percent less pork, 10 
percent less beef (50 percent less compared with 1990), and 
almost no lamb or mutton for general consumption (the number of 
lambs is steadily shrinking--at this moment, there are 
approximately 800,000). In such a situation, obviously we can 
expect a growth in prices, an increase in import, and a decline 
in export.

    [Editorial Report] The 23-24 April unification congress of 
the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) and the Democratic Union 
(UD) resulted in the formation of the Freedom Union (Unia 
Wolnosci or UW). The name, suggested by former Deputy Prime 
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and evoking an element of 
romanticism," a common aspect in Polish culture, was approved by 
a vote of KLD and UD members present at the unification 
congress. While the unification resolution itself was supported 
by an overwhelming majority of the delegates, 130 amendments to 
the newly adopted party statute were proposed at the congress. 
<H5>  Leadership </H5>
  Former UD leader Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected chairman of 
the new party according to a precongress arrangement by party 
leaders. Despite the fact that the KLD's Donald Tusk received 10 
votes more than Mazowiecki in the balloting for chairman, Tusk 
was named to the post of UW deputy chairman, instead. The 
congress also elected 100 representatives to the party's 
National Council (Rada Krajowa), with 73 from UD and 27 from the 
KLD, among them former Privatization Minister Janusz 
Lewandowski, former Labor Minister Michal Boni, former Prime 
Ministers Jan Krzysztof Bielecki and Hanna Suchocka, and 
prominent Sejm Deputies Jacek Merkel and Jacek Taylor. The UW's 
11-person presidium includes, in addition to Mazowiecki and 
Tusk, Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, Hanna Suchocka, Jan Maria Rokita, 
Bronislaw Komorowski, Bronislaw Geremek, Jan Litynski, Janusz 
Lewandowski, Pawel Piskorski, and Waldemar Kuczynski--a mix of 
left, right, and center, "just the way Tadeusz Mazowiecki 
wanted," according to Dominika Wielowieyska, writing in the 26 
April GAZETA WYBORCZA. Former Internal Affairs Minister 
Komorowski, described in a 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview as a 
"Christian Democrat ideologue" by fellow UW member Wladyslaw 
Frasyniuk, was elected UW general secretary. As reported in the 
25 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, Mazowiecki and Tusk promised that the 
new party would have "a clear, distinctive face." 
<H5>  UW Profile </H5>
  In the above-mentioned 25 April article, GAZETA WYBORCZA 
described the new party as center-oriented, "with a slight tilt 
to the right." Deputy Chairman Tusk emphasized that the party 
should "steer a center course" and build "a strong, consistent 
opposition" to the ruling coalition. He noted that "all we have 
to do is say that we are the opposition that embraces all those 
who are for freedom and against those seeking to strip us of 
this freedom, that we are against collective farming and we are 
for privatization, against socialist Poland and for the Third 
Republic." Mazowiecki reiterated that only the UW can be an 
alternative to the ruling coalition "that came to power only by 
criticizing the governments of the past five years, while the 
moral right to govern belongs to those who fought for the 
freedom." The Freedom Union's unification declaration, as 
reported in the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA, strongly criticized 
the past six months of governing by the leftist coalition, 
calling it "a lost time for Poland," underscoring the 
government's "halt of privatization" and "increase of the debt," 
while it was "simultaneously centralizing power, creating new 
privileges and alignments, and promoting political criteria in 
administration. 
  In the economic sphere, the congress assured the 
continuation 
of the economic reforms begun by the Mazowiecki government in 
1990. According to the 26 April GAZETA WYBORCZA article, the UW 
is "against raising taxes and limiting competition," supports 
reprivatization, and maintains that the state should not 
differentiate economic conditions "based on political pressures 
and tactical interests." In the 4 May RZECZPOSPOLITA interview, 
Komorowski said that "there is not much difference" between the 
UW's program and that of the precongress UD and KLD individual 
programs because "it originated as a result of many discussions 
between the two parties." Komorowski added that the "main 
elements" of the program are "strong support for a free market 
and democratic reform." 
<H5>  "Social Liberal" Faction </H5>
  In a move that clearly revealed the continuing ideological 
differences within the party, Jacek Kuron, former labor minister 
in Hanna Suchocka's government and an advocate of social 
programs for the underprivileged, declined to participate in the 
elections for the new party leadership, stressing that no party 
should be composed solely "of friends of the market" (UD) and 
"friends of the entrepeneurs" (KLD), "with no friends of the 
people." Kuron said that the new party may still be capable of 
creating an "ethos of civilization that might yet win the 
support of other groups and of a broader electorate." He 
expressed doubts, however, that the liberals (from the KLD) will 
be able to think in broader terms of "the state." In 
particular, Kuron opposes curbing the powers of trade unions, 
saying "demands for decent pay are worth listening to." (GAZETA 
WYBORCZA 25,26 April) 
<H5>  Post-Congress Commentaries </H5>
  Commentaries representing various points of view in major 
publications assessed the chances of the new party. A commentary 
in the 30 April POLITYKA by Mariusz Janicki highlighted the 
congress's usage of "strong anticommunist rhetoric" emphasis on 
unity, and confidence that "every educated, unprejudiced and non 
pro-PRL [pre-1989 People's Republic of Poland] person will vote 
for it." The Freedom Union has, in Janicki's opinion, a chance 
to be an alternative to the ruling coalition, especialy now 
when, in Mazowiecki's words, "the governing coalition cannot 
hide its absurdities, ineptness, and rash decisions." 
  Boguslaw Mazur, writing in the 8 May issue of the Poznan 
weekly WPROST, a magazine that entertains leftist views, 
observes that "the Christian-democratic/liberal group has the 
dominant role in the UW leadership," whereas that faction 
represented by Frasyniuk and Zofia Kuratowska, more 
social-democratic in tone, is in the minority. Mazur predicted 
that the latter faction may yet leave the Union, allowing the 
center-right group of Jan Maria Rokita, former chief of the 
Council of Ministers in the Suchocka government, to become the 
major force. 
  In the 6 May RZECZPOSPOLITA, Jan Szomburg, president of the 
Gdansk-based Institute of Research on the Market Economy and a 
KLD activist, cites some of UD and the KLD's past weaknesses, 
asking why UD, "the strongest intellectual party in the 
postcommunist world, was unable to communicate the sense of 
reform to the average voter. Szomburg noted that recent polls 
show that only 30-40 percent of the people consider themselves 
advocates of the free market. He questions the UD's "lack of 
communication, arrogant language, and absence of a clear 
message" and asks why there was such an expectation on the 
party's part that society would put its complete trust "in the 
hands of an elite." Szomburg is also critical of the KLD, 
calling it "a party that payed more attention to style than to 
substance, too inclined to political pragmatism that somehow 
watered down the party's identity." Szomburg added that a 
proreform program with a clear strategic vision leading to the 
completion of the economic and political reforms is necessary in 
order for the Freedom Union to be succesful. Such a vision, 
according to Szomburg, requires a dose of romanticism," to which 
Freedom Union "is no stranger." 
  While the UD garnered just under 11 percent of the vote in 
the September 1993 parliamentary elections, the KLD's 4-percent 
support left the party under the 5-percent threshold required 
for parliamentary participation. As reported by WPROST magazine 
in its 8 May edition, recent polls show that Freedom Union 
enjoys the support of 22 percent of the electorate, mostly among 
people between the ages of 20 and 39.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sandor Nagy, chairman of the National </F>
Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions and Hungarian Socialist 
Party member of the National Assembly, by an unidentified 
correspondent; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [FIGYELO] How much of the success of the MSZP 
[Hungarian Socialist Party] in the elections to date do you 
attribute to its agreement with the MSZOSZ [National Federation 
of Hungarian Trade Unions]? 
  [Nagy] That of course would be difficult to calculate. But 
it 
would be meaningless to speculate about this if for no other 
reason than because the trade unions are the natural allies of a 
party that is pursuing social democratic values. If you were to 
ask me what would have happened to the MSZP without the trade 
unions' support, that would be the same as asking me what would 
have become of the MSZP if it had not started as a social 
democratic party in the elections? 
  [FIGYELO] In 1989 the MSZOSZ still defined itself as a trade 
union movement that stood above fights between political 
parties. Why has the MSZOSZ altered its standpoint? 
  [Nagy] Many people believe that this is the final resolution 
of an alliance, formed of necessity, between two organizations 
forced into quarantine in 1990. But that is not how things 
stand. Actually, what has changed is the situation rather than 
our standpoint. It was normal for us to distance ourselves from 
the elections and political parties during the change of 
political systems. But now we are speaking about the possibility 
and necessity of changing governments. What kind of government 
comes to power cannot be indifferent to the trade unions. 
  [FIGYELO] In the autumn of 1993 you people regarded an 
election alliance conceivable not just with the MSZP but also 
with the NDSZ [National Democratic Association] and the Agrarian 
Alliance. But not with the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], 
the most likely coalition partner of the MSZP. How will you fit 
into a governing coalition that advocates two liberal economic 
policies? 
  [Nagy] On this I am able to express only my own personal 
opinion, which does not play a role in the MSZP's choice of a 
coalition partner. Nor would it be right if it did play a role. 
  As a trade union leader, I would not welcome a government 
economic policy that could be described by a single adjective, 
as liberal. Simply put, it would mean that the strong maintain 
their footing while the weak go under. If thinking in terms of 
shock therapy were added to all this, that would lead to 
conflicts. In my opinion, incidentally, the economic policy of 
the MSZP is characterized not so much by liberalism as by 
pragmatism. 
  [FIGYELO] I assume that your acceptance of the MSZP's 
economic policy concept, which bears the hallmark of Laszlo 
Bekesi's name and is of a liberal nature after all, was also a 
condition of your nomination by the MSZP as a candidate for a 
parliamentary seat. 
  [Nagy] I have already declared on several occasions that 
this 
program--together with its associated employment, social policy, 
and other programs, of course--is readily acceptable to the 
trade unions. At the same time, nobody has demanded of me that 
I, on behalf of the trade unions, endorse every line of this 
program and thereby give the future government what amounts to a 
blank check. 
  [FIGYELO] In the end the MSZP adopted the fifth version of 
the Bekesi program. To what extent are the changes in the final 
version a result of the agreement between the MSZP and the 
MSZOSZ? 
  [Nagy] We did not take part in the program's substantive 
elaboration, but our views were well known to the leadership of 
the MSZP. In the course of the debate within the MSZP, wording 
more agreeable to us as well were included in the program. The 
final version, for instance, is socially more sensitive to the 
problems of the strata in the worst possible situation, and it 
regards the reduction of unemployment as a direct objective. 
  [FIGYELO] What do you think? Will the majority within the 
MSZP parliamentary group hold opinions closer to your own or to 
Bekesi's? 
  [Nagy] I would be unable to assess that, and I do not know 
what others are thinking. But on certain questions--and here I 
have primarily the social problems in mind--I would not be 
surprised to see a majority holding views closer to my own. 
Otherwise our relations with Bekesi are proper; we hold 
consultations regularly, and also debates when necessary. 
  [FIGYELO] During the election campaign Gyula Horn frequently 
advanced the argument that shifting the transformation's burdens 
onto wage and salary earners could not continue. You yourself 
said that workers have had to pay an inordinately high price for 
the transformation. It suggests that this is something the new 
government could remedy quickly, whereas spending at the expense 
of growing internal and external debt and the long-continuing 
squandering of assets have also meant the squandering of our 
future, which makes illusory the promise of maintaining the 
level of real incomes in the coming years. 
  [Nagy] Nobody is promising a quick turnaround. We know very 
well that it is not possible to aim for practically full 
employment and a slower rate of inflation in the short term. It 
is particularly tragic that, to a large extent, the population's 
sacrifices have been in vain, because in the end the outgoing 
government has failed in the fiscal and monetary sphere as well. 
Everyone knows that difficult years are ahead. Nowhere do I find 
any expectations of a miracle. 
  [FIGYELO] Do you agree with Laszlo Bekesi's statement that, 
under the conditions of the present crisis, social democratic 
answers to the problems are not possible? 
  [Nagy] Yes. This period is not conducive to social 
democratic 
values, but they must be upheld nevertheless. The most serious 
social problems have to be remedied. 
  [FIGYELO] Do you accept that halting the rapid worsening of 
the budget deficit and its subsequent improvement will be the 
principal task in the coming years? 
  [Nagy] Perhaps this is the correct formulation in view of 
the 
sequence of the tasks. But it would be more to my liking to say 
that we must strive simultaneously to create the conditions for 
a balanced budget and economic recovery, to reduce unemployment, 
to roll back inflation, and to manage our social problems. Or 
more accurately, to optimize these partially conflicting 
objectives. 
  [FIGYELO] According to Laszlo Bekesi, budgetary reform would 
be accompanied by a reduction of real incomes, by 4 or 5 percent 
a year over a period of three years, and about half of this 
reduction could be offset. What do these figures mean to you? 
  [Nagy] According to the MSZP's economic policy program, 
budgetary reform would have to be accompanied by compensation 
for most members of society. If the government found that this 
was not feasible, it would have to negotiate with the trade 
unions. It is still too early to speak of numbers. But we 
certainly think it will be essential to halt the decline of 
wages within the foreseeable future, and to raise the real value 
of the smallest pensions, even in the short term. 
  [FIGYELO] All the present opposition parties are against the 
current consolidation of banks and debtors, or rather the manner 
in which this is being done. How does the MSZOSZ feel about this? 
  [Nagy] We are convinced that the rescuing of some 
enterprises 
is warranted. Consolidation should have begun sooner. But the 
state cannot make a practice of using taxpayers' money to 
rescue, time and again, the firms that get into trouble. In our 
opinion, the way to reconcile these two requirements is to 
complete the privatization of the banks as soon as possible. 
Then it will be in the banks' best interest to choose the 
solutions that will be the most suitable also in the long run. 
These solutions, of course, will vary by enterprises. In other 
words, we too oppose the present state-administrative mechanism 
of decisionmaking. 
  [FIGYELO] Last fall the MSZOSZ published its standpoint on 
privatization in which it demanded first of all that closer 
attention be paid to considerations of employment. Does the 
MSZOSZ really believe that disguised unemployment has already 
ceased at the enterprises about to be privatized, and 
structurally they already meet the market's requirements? In 
other words, that layoffs at these enterprises can be avoided? 
  [Nagy] We oppose the present practice of privatization that 
strives for maximum proceeds--which, incidentally, are then 
squandered--and does not care what happens to the enterprises 
after privatization. Therefore, we believe, preference should be 
given to buyers who guarantee to maintain the level of 
employment and to raise the capital. 
  [FIGYELO] On the one hand, I do not believe that buyers 
paying cash are not interested in the enterprises' efficient 
operation in the future. On the other hand, I feel that the 
wider employee stock ownership, which the MSZOSZ has also been 
demanding, is in conflict with your concern for the enterprises' 
future. After all, workers usually do not have money to invest, 
and delaying necessary layoffs could drive the entire firm into 
bankruptcy. 
  [Nagy] It would be a misconception to conclude from MSZOSZ 
support for employee stock ownership programs that the MSZOSZ 
believes in employees' holding a majority interest. We think it 
is more important that the firm be in good hands and the workers 
hold well-paying jobs than that they become owners. At the same 
time we believe that it would be expedient if also 
representatives of the industrial union concerned were present 
when privatization decisions were being made. Even the mutual 
exchange of information could avoid many misunderstandings. 
  [FIGYELO] Don't you think that insistence on transferring 
state assets to Social Insurance should cease? On the one hand, 
a large proportion of state assets earns hardly any income. On 
the other hand, Social Insurance would not be a good owner 
because of its inability to raise capital and its incentive to 
extract as much profit as possible. 
  [Nagy] Professional investors abroad welcome union pension 
funds, for instance, as co-owners of equity. Social Insurance's 
short-term paucity of cash unquestionably creates a 
contradictory situation. All these problems should be thought 
through in the bill on Social Insurance. 
  [FIGYELO] In your dual capacity as trade union chairman and 
Social Insurance officer, you must have had opportunity to enjoy 
the pleasures stemming from the contradictions between being a 
ruling-party member of parliament and holding trade union 
office. As trade union chairman, you should be demanding the 
reduction of social insurance contributions, which entrepreneurs 
particularly find detrimental and which are an especially 
serious obstacle to job creation in the regular economy. But as 
an officer of Social Insurance, you have an interest in 
increasing its revenue, from which benefits are paid. To resolve 
this contradiction, the MSZOSZ has invented a solution that has 
been aired in the media, namely to offset the reduction of 
social insurance contributions by reallocating tax revenues. To 
my mind, that is merely juggling. 
  [Nagy] The contradiction you mentioned exists only 
partially, 
and there is an answer also to the dilemma of reducing social 
nsurance contributions. The contributions are so high at present 
because willingness to pay the contributions is very low, Social 
Insurance has a substantial amount of contributions owed in its 
receivables, and many people are working in the underground 
economy. The next government should have the determination to 
declare war on the underground economy, although in a civilized 
manner. In that case the burdens on the regular sphere would be 
reduced. It is intolerable that many private entrepreneurs are 
employing even the best skilled workers merely for minimal 
wages. It is conceivable that in the future the amount of the 
employees' contribution fund will be determined on the basis of 
empirical data gathered in the given industry. Health insurance 
is where I regard as feasible the offsetting of lower 
contributions with tax revenue, on the principle of universal 
entitlement to health care. 
  [FIGYELO] In recent months, both the present opposition and 
the MSZOSZ expressed support for concluding an economic and 
social pact. Do you think there is any difference in the topics 
on which the individual organizations wish to reach agreement? 
  [Nagy] At present we are able to speak only of initial and 
rather tentative intentions. Obvious topics will be all the 
economic problems we have already mentioned: nominal wages and 
pensions, inflation, taxes, the burdens of budgetary reform, the 
development of social entitlements, and of real wages and 
incomes that can be predicted over a horizon of several years. 
The MSZOSZ also has objectives on which others perhaps are not 
laying so much stress. These objectives include laying down the 
statutory and legal conditions for the current reconciliation of 
interests, and the trade unions' operating conditions. These are 
not primarily financial issues. In parliament, for instance, a 
receiving and transmitting station ought to be established for 
agreements on the reconciliation of interests. To this day there 
is no parliamentary committee that could link with parliament's 
work the information circulating within the system of labor 
relations. There is also a need to develop the conditions for 
negotiating agreements at the intermediate--i.e., 
industry--level; such agreements barely exist at present. But if 
a country attaches importance to properly functioning trade 
unions, then I think it is conceivable that the trade unions 
could be granted tax exemptions for publishing newspapers, and 
for their hotels or commercial office buildings. 
  [FIGYELO] Do I understand you correctly? Is the MSZOSZ 
demanding the expansion of the influence of the trade union 
apparatus, in exchange for the trade unions' self-restraint, the 
extent of which is, of course, open to bargaining? 
  [Nagy] There is no question of that at all, because one is 
not a substitute for the other. We obviously have to represent 
the employees' interests first and foremost. The operating 
conditions stem from the trade union movement's participation in 
the reconciliation of interests, and related considerations rank 
only second, but they too are important. 
  [FIGYELO] It is conspicuous that the militant job actions in 
recent months--the locomotive engineers' strike, and aviation 
mechanics' strike--were organized by unions that do not belong 
to the MSZOSZ. 
  [Nagy] These strikes were staged in small, closed trades 
capable of asserting their interests effectively. The workers in 
these trades belong to either the League [Democratic League of 
Independent Trade Unions] or the Autonomous Trade Unions. In 
light of this, I am especially surprised, and occasionally 
slightly offended or perhaps bemused, to hear ourselves accused 
of demagoguery. During the past four years, in a period of 
rapidly rising unemployment and continually declining real 
wages, MSZOSZ policy has remained unchanged. We will continue to 
seek the most sensible solutions, within the limits of economic 
reality. 
  [FIGYELO] In the absence of exact criteria, I suspect, trade 
union leaders are doomed to being accused constantly of either 
demagoguery or capitulation. In the open reconciliation of 
interests, nevertheless, there can be a role also for the views 
of trades, and for the various groups within society that have 
contrasting interests. But many people fear the intertwining of 
the MSZOSZ and MSZP in parliament because it offers an 
opportunity for bad compromises behind the scene, just as in the 
period of the party-state. Especially worrisome is the growing 
influence of the trade unions in lagging industries, because it 
could delay structural change. 
  [Nagy] Nobody is thinking of secret agreements. The point is 
specifically that, through the economic and social pact, the 
public can be initiated into the economy's real dilemmas and 
able to understand also the background of moves made under the 
pressure of necessity. 
  But this process also has its own psychology. The government 
must begin to reveal the situation with moves that demonstrate 
its own determination, such as putting an end to state 
squandering, unnecessary offices, and other expenditures. I 
realize that the resulting savings would be insignificant in 
comparison with the shortage, but they would demonstrate that 
the government is practicing what it preaches. The other urgent 
state task is law enforcement, the already mentioned action 
against the underground economy. If the government advances in 
these areas, it will have moral authority to ask even for 
further temporary belt-tightening, in view of the difficult 
economic situation. Straightforward talk and the government's 
new work method could liberate enormous energy. Under these 
conditions the trade unions could be ready and willing to 
conclude an honorable agreement.

  [Text] We have just received a statement from today's 
session of the Presidential Council for Defense and National 
Security, which was held in the presidential palace and chaired 
by Dr. Franjo Tudjman, president of the Republic of Croatia. 
  The Council considered some questions with regard to 
international and internal relations, and a report on the visit 
of Franjo Tudjman to Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  In this connection the Council assessed that, through this 
visit, the Republic of Croatia has provided a significant 
impetus to the revitalization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
federation and a confederation with Croatia, while international 
groups have been able to see for themselves that the Croatians 
are implementing the Washington agreement consistently. 
  The prime minister, who led a Croatian delegation at an 
international gathering in Crans-Montana, told the Council about 
the numerous meetings he had at this gathering. The Croatian 
Government delegation won recognition during the many contacts 
made at the gathering for the successful maintenance of 
stability of the Croatian national currency, the kuna, and for 
the successful implementation of economic policy. Great interest 
was shown in the many meetings aimed at creating investments in 
the Republic of Croatia. The Croatian delegation also had talks 
on the complicated problems of transforming socially owned 
property into privately owned property, something facing all 
postcommunist countries. 
  The Council also considered the package of measures which 
the 
Croatian Government should implement in order to breathe life 
into the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation and a confederation with 
Croatia. In this connection the need was expressed for constant 
coordination -- and analysis of trends and the achievement of 
results in different spheres -- between the Republic of Croatia 
and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. 
  The Council considered some problems of transformation and 
privatization in Croatia, and at the proposal of the Government 
concluded that, because of the enhanced interest of large 
international companies and Croatians abroad in investing in 
Croatia, the Council would devote one of its coming sessions to 
this problem alone, the statement from the president's office 
concludes.

  [Text] The Constitutional Court reviewed the case 
initiated by 49 people's deputies of the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS] in connection with the parliament's vote on the 
structural changes proposed by the prime minister on 20 May. 
Constitutional Court Judge Aleksandur Arabadzhiev reports the 
court's decision: 
  [Begin Arabadzhiev recording] The prime minister has no 
constitutional obligation to submit his cabinet's resignation 
when the National Assembly rejects one of his proposals to 
establish new ministries or make changes in the membership of 
the cabinet. [end recording] 
  The prime minister has to resign when the National Assembly 
votes no-confidence in the cabinet or in him personally, or when 
the cabinet does not receive the vote of confidence it had 
demanded. The rest, Mr. Arabadzhiev added, is a matter of 
political culture and tradition.

  [Text] A second round of talks between Presidents Vaclav 
Havel and Ion Iliescu, with the participation of the two 
official delegations, took place at Cotroceni Palace this 
afternoon. 
  In a statement to the press at the end of the talks, 
President Ion Iliescu stressed the particular political 
significance of the first visit that the head of the new Czech 
state has paid to Romania, which demonstrates the joint will to 
develop the rich tradition of relations between the two 
countries on new foundations and the mutual interest in 
developing bilateral relations in all areas. 
  As regards international issues that were approached during 
the talks, Mr. Ion Iliescu stressed the joint interest for 
integration in international processes and bodies and the very 
good relations between Romania and the Czech Republic within 
these bodies. 
  For his part, President Vaclav Havel, referring to the 
friendship treaty between Romania and the Czech Republic, stated 
that the act of signing this treaty, which will take place 
tomorrow, 22 June, is a starting point for a new kind of 
relations between the two countries. Mr. Havel added that 
during his talks with President Iliescu and Premier Nicolae 
Vacaroiu, particular attention was paid to economic relations 
and ways to develop them. 
  The official dinner given by Romania's President Ion Iliescu 
in honor of President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel is 
scheduled to take place at this hour at Cotroceni Palace, our 
correspondent Sorin Croitorescu informs us. 
  Also today, Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu met 
with Vaclav Havel at the latter's rooms. The talks were 
attended by Teodor Melescanu, the Romanian foreign minister, and 
Jiri Skaliczky, the Czech minister of privatization. Recalling 
the positive development of the framework for Romanian-Czech 
relations, especially after the visit to our country by Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, Mr. Vacaroiu stressed that the new 
judicial framework of bilateral relations initiated on that 
occasion needs to be completed as soon as possible, with the 
conclusion of a free trade agreement between the two countries, 
implementing the memorandum that has been established in this 
respect between the two governments. Assessing bilateral 
relations between the two countries positively, the Romanian 
prime minister stressed the need to develop economic and 
commercial relations between the two states. In this context, an 
important role is played by the exchange of experience in the 
field of privatization, which is an area of great interest to 
both countries. 
  President Havel stressed the significant drop in the volume 
of bilateral commercial exchanges as a result of the collapse of 
the old system of economic relations in Eastern Europe and 
emphasized the need to rebuild these relations of cooperation on 
the basis of the principles of the market economy. In this 
respect, the process of economic and commercial rapprochement 
between the two countries depends mainly on commercial 
companies. However, governments are duty-bound to create a 
favorable climate, something that the two countries have already 
started to achieve by concluding the Romanian-Czech accord for 
mutual protection of investment, the accord on avoidance of

<F P=106> [BNA TIKER report: "Statement That the Yugoslav Army Has </F>
Been Pushed Back Is Ridiculous"] 
  [Text] Belgrade (BNA TIKER) -- A statement by Macedonian 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Defense 
Minister Vlado Popovski that the Macedonian Army has pushed back 
the Yugoslav Army from certain posts within the FRY [Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia] is more of a political statement 
intended for the Macedonian public then a serious approach to 
the normalization of relations between the two neighboring 
countries -- TIKER has learned unofficially at the FRY Defense 
Ministry. 
  The Yugoslav Army border patrols are situated exclusively on 
the territory of the FRY and have not on a single occasion 
entered Macedonian territory. The same sources claim that the 
activities of the Macedonian Armed Forces have been observed in 
the vicinity of the border, but the Yugoslav Army will not react 
unless the FRY's sovereignty and territory integrity are 
endangered. 
  Yugoslavia and Macedonia do not share a state border but 
merely an administrative border. The border problems will be 
resolved when a mixed commission goes into the field and marks 
the border with stone markers, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
in Skopje says. 
  An UNPROFOR observer team has already been deployed on the 
border crossing between the FRY and Macedonia near Kriva Palanka 
for 12 days. Some 10 Blue Helmets are monitoring the activity 
of the FRY soldiers, UNPROFOR spokesman in Skopje Elizabeth 
Baldwin told TIKER. Macedonia has presented its maps to us and 
it claims that this is its territory, Elizabeth Baldwin says. 
She added that Yugoslavia did not present its maps to UNPROFOR 
even though it was requested to do so.

  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko has ended his 
visit to the United States, during which he explained to his 
U.S. partners the Polish Government's economic program. 
Grzegorz Kolodko believes that he has succeeded in convincing 
representatives of the Washington government and the IMF that 
the present Polish Government is not wrecking what their 
predecessors have done and that the Strategy for Poland program 
is the plan for the future. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] The IMF, Treasury Secretary 
Dentsen, and Ms. Tyson, head of President Clinton's team of 
economic advisors, who will visit Poland together with the 
president, all believe that this ambitious program and its 
objectives will be fulfilled and implemented if the work is well 
organized and if government policy is clear and firm, which we 
are, of course, determined to pursue. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Grzegorz Kolodko has also announced plans to set 
up a Polish-U.S. investment fund to support the privatization 
process in Poland. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko hopes that 
initially it will be possible to make $100 million available for 
the fund.

  [Text] Tirana, June 18 (ATA) -- Due to insistence of the 
Albanian delegation, a paragraph concerning the situation in 
Kosova was included in the final document approved by the CSCE 
senior officials at the 27th meeting of its committee, according 
to an information of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Emphasizing the escalation of the situation in Kosova because 
of the continuing repression, the document demands immediate and 
unconditional return of the CSCE long-term missions to Kosova, 
reestablishing and functioning of the democratic institutions 
and resolving the statute of Kosova. 
  The meeting treated also the request of The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] for a full membership in the CSCE 
and Albania gave its consensus for accepting this republic. But 
a full membership of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
was again blocked by Greece. 
  During the meeting, the Albanian delegation read a statement 
in regard to the relations with Greece after the incident of 
April 10, 1994, emphasizing that it is very important to clarify 
the circumstances of the incident and repeated the idea that 
without excepting other forms, an examination of the facts by 
the CSCE would help in a full clarification of this question. 
The Albanian delegation emphasized the importance of the 
normalization of the Albanian-Greek relations for the two 
countries and for the situation in the region. The Greek 
representative at the meeting expressed also his confidence that 
the two sides would know to overcome this situation, the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported today.

various documents proving the anti-Albanian activity of the 
Greek chauvinistic circles, the newspaper REPUBLIKA, in its 
latest issue, carried a letter by Sotir Qirjazati, chairman of 
Omonia, sent to the Greek Premier Mitsotakis on May 30, 1992. 
Through this letter, the chairman of Omonia, demands 
self-determination and autonomy of the Greek minority in 
Albania. Also, he considers the U.S.A. and some European

  [Text] Tirana, June 22 (ATA) -- Minister of Defence Safet 
Zhulali described his visit to the United States as "successful 
and fruitful in the relations between the United States and 
Albania." Speaking before reporters at a press conference he 
declared yesterday that his visit made at the invitation of the 
National Guard of South Carolina "ended with the preparation of 
a joint program which envisages assistance for the Albanian 
Army, in legislation, technical-scientific assistance, and in 
the engineering field. The program is expected to be approved 
by the Pentagon now." 
  The second part of this visit to Washington was described by 
Minister Zhulali as "a new possibility for the increase and 
further development of cooperation between the Albanian and the 
U.S. Armies. It envisages a further intensification of 
contacts, the signing of new agreements, and their quick 
application and the further elevation of the level of 
cooperation." 
  In the meetings with senior Pentagon officials, Mr. Zhulali 
said, they had discussed the tense situation in the region, the 
conflict in Bosnia, the situation in Kosova and Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. They had 
represented their options for the solution of the conflict in 
the region, which consist of an open dialogue and an active role 
in the peace process. 
  With regard to Kosova, the Albanian party had requested the 
beginning of an open dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina with 
the intermediation of a third party, which the Albanian Party 
had proposed to be the United States. The secretary of defense, 
William Perry, expressed his readiness for support towards 
Albania and accepted the invitation to visit Albania soon. 
  Asked by a reporter whether the U.S. party will play the 
role 
of an intermediator between Pristina and Belgrade, Minister 
Zhulali responded that "It is not the desire of the United 
States and Albania, but other states that are for peace demand 
this. It is important that this dialogue should begin as soon 
as possible and we hold that the dialogue must be constructive," 
Mr. Zhulali said.

  [Text] Malesi e Madhe, June 21 (ATA) -- During the 
1992-1993 period a great number of enterprises have been created 
and established economic and trade relations with Montenegro, 
according to the Taxes Office of the Shkoder district. But the 
cooperation of those enterprises did not succeed because Albania 
is observing the UN Security Council economic embargo against 
the Federative [as received] Republic of Yugoslavia. 
  Consequently, the number of the private enterprises which 
exercise their activity in Malesi e Madhe district has decreased 
to 92 having 553 employed persons. A concrete example of the 
embargo's influence is the Vatnikaj Enterprise which had 100 
workers before the UN decision for economic embargo against 
former Yugoslavia. All the workers have now left this 
enterprise and Vatnikaj is close to bankruptcy.

  [Text] Tirana, June 21 (ATA) -- The Presidency of the 
Republican Party [PR] of Albania received the visiting 
delegation of the European Democratic Union yesterday, according 
to the spokesman of the PR party. Geoffrey Pattie, head of the 
delegation, said in the meeting that "Albania is a significant 
country for the European Democratic Union" adding "we like to 
come here to follow the development of the democratic process." 
Later he expressed interest in the vision of the Republican 
Party of Albania on this question. 
  Fatmir Veliu, deputy chairman of the Republican Party, 
underlined that the Republican Party has made and continues to 
make all efforts to strengthen the democratic right wing against 
social communist threat. Only a total engagement of the 
Albanian political right wing forces, he said, can uproot 
communism and cleanse the state administration form its 
collaborators. The Republican Party, Mr. Veliu said further on, 
has energetically rejected the latest decision of the parliament 
on compensating the site with vouchers supporting the view that 
the real value of the land can be defined only with the 
realisation of the real bargain market, which is attained with 
the restitution of property to their owners. 
  Mr. Geoffrey Pattie, on behalf of the European Democratic 
Union thanked those present for their briefing and said that the 
Republican Party makes up an increasing tendency for the 
Albanian public. He also gave explanations about the 
documentation and ways to be followed for the Republican Party's 
membership to the European Democratic Union. 
  On the same day, Mr. Pattie held a meeting with Albanian 
reporters during which views were exchanged about the Albanian 
mass media, the role it plays during the present democratic 
developments in Albania and about the application of the Law of 
the Press, recently approved by the majority of the Albanian 
reporters. The participants in the meeting also spoke of the 
freedoms and rights as well as of the difficulties the Albanian 
reporters are faced with today.

  [Text] Prague, June 21 (CTK) -- In a meeting with Spanish 
Senate President Juan Jose Laborda, Czech parliament Chairman 
Milan Uhde today welcomed the possibility that both chambers of 
the Spanish parliament could ratify the association agreement 
signed between the Czech Republic and the European Union (EU) 
this year. A delegation of the Spanish Senate arrived here 
yesterday for a four-day visit. Uhde said Spanish politicians 
had supported the Czech Republic's aspirations to become a 
member of Western European structures. After a meeting with 
Laborda, Czech Deputy Premier Jan Kalvoda told CTK that Laborda 
said he was convinced the Spanish parliament would approve the 
association agreement in autumn without any problems.

<F P=106> [Article by C.H.: "Think Global, Act Western; the Czech-EU </F>
Trade Marriage"] 
  [Text] Over the last four years, Czech trade with European 
Union member states has skyrocketed to the point that the EU is 
the country's largest foreign trading partner, accounting for 
nearly half of Czech exports in 1993. 
  The Czech Republic's export business has been turning more 
and more toward developed economies, while trade with former 
East-bloc countries and the former USSR has remained close to 
the same levels or, in some cases, dropped off. From 1992 to 
1993 alone, exports to the EU jumped 24 percent, accounting for 
$5.5 billion US, while imports from the EU increased by 10 
percent to $1.1 billion US. 
  Still, trade between the EU, the world's largest single 
economy, and the Czech Republic is not completely free. And this 
continues to irk some Czech leaders. 
  "We have never asked for [economic] assistance. We asked 
only 
for foreign trade. But unfortunately these barriers exist, and 
will continue to exist for the near future," said Vladimir 
Budinsky, chair of Czech Parliament's economics committee. 
  Petr Postulka, head of the EU division at the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade's Foreign Trade Section, said that with the 
recession in Europe right now, "It's not always easy to achieve 
positive results, because the situation of the European Union is 
not very positive." 
  But, he said, arrangements to fully liberalize two sensitive 
trade sectors--textiles and steel--in which the Czech Republic's 
goods traditionally undersell those made within the EU, should 
be completed by the beginning of 1997. A free trade agreement 
with the Czech Republic for most other industrial goods should 
be signed by 1995.

<F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: "Western, Czech Interests Compete for </F>
Control of Oil Refineries"] 
  [Text] Managers of the Czech Republic's oil 
refineries are fighting to keep control over their operations, 
while four Western companies have banded together with a 
proposal to spend over $500 million modernizing the local 
plants--in exchange for a 49 percent stake. 
  Four Western oil companies have mounted a half-billion 
dollar 
bid to revamp the outmoded Czech oil industry, but they face 
stiff competition from Czech refinery owners who want to keep 
operations in their own hands. 
  Calling themselves International Oil Companies (IOC), Agip 
of 
Italy, Total of France, the Dutch-English concern Shell, and 
Conoco, offspring of the U.S. firm DuPont, are awaiting word 
from the Czech council of economic ministers on the future of 
their proposal. In return for a 49 percent stage in the 
industry, they are pledging 15 billion Kc ($520 million) over 
five years toward restructuring and modernizing. Depending on 
regional demand for oil, that investment could more than double 
over time, according to IOC Project manager Gert J. de Bruin of 
Total. If approved, it would be among the largest investments in 
Central Europe to date. 
  Approval, however, is far from certain. Although the IOC 
expects word sometime this week, the economic ministers have 
delayed past meetings, possibly to allow time for development of 
the so-called "Czech way" counter proposal. Dusan Nepejchal, 
general director of one of the two largest Czech refineries, 
Chemopetrol, believes the whole basis of negotiation may be 
changed, in part because of what he perceives as oversights in 
the IOC plan. 
  The IOC proposed merging operations of the two main Czech 
oil 
refineries, Chemopetrol in Litvinov and Kaucuk in Kralupy. Both 
plants would undergo modernization to meet environmental 
requirements, increase safety measures and compete more 
effectively abroad. The plants would receive Western know-how 
and sell through Shell, Conoco, Agip and Total gas stations here 
and in neighboring countries. 
  "If the Czech oil industry really wants to survive, then 
these small refineries should not compete one against the other, 
but be strong together," de Bruin said. Fuel producers abroad 
already undercut Czech oil with less expensive, higher quality 
fuels. 
  Nepejchal claims no argument with this principle. "We 
realize 
that our market is very small and we must save it for our 
companies," he said. He believes, however, that integration 
should include not only Kaucuk and Chemopetrol, but also the 
country's two smaller refineries, Koramo in Kolin and Paramo in 
Pardubice. 
  The "Czech way" proposal goes beyond oil-refining 
activities. 
Litvinov also has petrochemical operations and produces 
fertilizers. Kaucuk manufactures plastics and rubber synthetics 
for tires. The Czech refineries hope to modernize these sectors 
as well. 
  Petrochemistry is of scant interest to IOC members. Although 
their proposal includes technical support and contributions of 
know-how to these sectors, it is not a focus for investment. 
"All four companies have said their interests are in refining 
and not fertilizing or petrochemistry," de Bruin said. "[They] 
do not have experience in petrochemistry." 
  Given this fact, Nepejchal would like to see the refineries 
take their own lead, while using domestic and foreign capital to 
finance an industry overhaul. 
  "It is not such a big problem for us to get the necessary 
know-how," Nepejchal said. "And there are investors, both from 
Czech and foreign banks, who are interested in giving us credit." 
  The Czech industry will need help, however, in securing 
access to global markets. For Nepejchal, this portion of the IOC 
plan is the most attractive. He would like to see joint venture 
agreements concluded farther down the line. 
  The IOC has high hopes for its vision of the future of Czech 
oil refining, especially since its proposal was designed in 
cooperation with the government. Several Western concerns 
responded last year when Vladimir Dlouhy, minister of trade and 
industry, asked for proposals to modernize the Czech oil 
refining industry, de Bruin said. Shell proposed modernizing the 
Kaucuk refinery, while Agip, Total and Conoco together proposed 
combining Kaucuk with Chemopetrol. At the ministry's behest, the 
two proposals were combined. 
  Keeping in mind that market access is a key selling point of 
the plan, the Western oil companies are offering support for 
financing the long-planned Ingolstadt pipeline, stretching from 
the Italian port of Trieste through Germany to both Litvinov and 
Kralupy. It would bring new sources of oil to the Czech 
Republic, replacing the country's dependence on low-grade oil 
from the Russian Druzba ("Friendship") pipeline. In the planning 
stages for about five years, the pipeline is expected to cost DM 
700 million ($421 million) to build. 
  Frantisek Kubelka thinks the IOC proposal is a good one. As 
general director of the industrial section at the ministry of 
trade and industry, Kubelka has overseen negotiations with IOC 
members about the project. Still, neither Kubelka nor anyone 
with the IOC would venture a guess as to what the government 
will decide. 
  "That is difficult for anyone to say," Kubelka said.

  [Text] Prague June 22 (CTK) -- The World Bank, which 
sharply opposed the Czech-invented method of coupon 
privatisation four years ago, has now been pushing for the 
scheme's export, and is ready to finance its implementation, the 
independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES writes today. Coupon 
privatisation was launched in the former Czechoslovakia in 1992 
when the first wave was held. Currently the second wave is 
under way in the Czech Republic, while Slovakia has been 
preparing for it and may launch it in the autumn. It is 
estimated that by the time the second wave ends property worth 
350 billion crowns (about $11.7 billion) will have been in 
private hands, the paper writes. 
  Recently Premier Vaclav Klaus said coupon privatisation 
would 
end by the year's end after which other privatisation methods 
would be applied. Property worth a total of 950 billion crowns 
is to be privatised in the Czech Republic. 
  Dusan Triska, one of the authors of coupon privatisation, 
said yesterday that the owner of "the intangible side of the 
project of coupon privatisation" was the Czech Government which 
would have agree to the possible export of the scheme. (Two 
other co-authors of the scheme are Premier Vaclav Klaus and the 
former chairman of the National Property Fund, Tomas Jezek.) 
  Triska said that Czech experts had already played a role in 
the creation of the privatisation law in Bulgaria, and therefore 
it was very probable that the Czech model would be maximally 
applied there. 
  The concrete deal would probably be concluded by Podnik 
vypocetni techniky (Computer Technology Centre) and a partner 
business company from Bulgaria, and it would be financed by the 
World Bank, Triska said. He said that Czech experts have 
already been advising the Governments of Kazakhstan, Slovenia, 
and Latvia on how best to apply the Czech method in their 
countries' conditions. 
  Interest in Czech coupon privatisation as it has been 
implemented in the Czech Republic has also been shown by 
Algeria. Czech experts will go to Algeria to assess along with 
their Algerian colleagues possibilities of applying the scheme 
there, Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik announced at a 
recent international economic forum in Crans-Montana, 
Switzerland. 
  But Triska is quoted by MLADA FRONTA DNES as saying that the 
Czech model could be exported only partially because it was 
closely connected with concrete personalities and because it was 
being born in concrete political, economic and legal conditions 
of Czechoslovakia. 
  That is also why Czech experts have recently recommended to 
the Latvian Government to make certain changes in the 
implementation of the Czech model.

<F P=106> [Article by Charles Hornberger: "Uruguay Final Act Good for </F>
Czech Goods"] 
  [Text] Following the closure of the decade-long Uruguay 
Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), 
Czech government officials are predicting an annual GDP boost of 
1 to 2 percent as a result of increased trade. 
  After months of frantic argument and compromise among the 
world's largest industrial powers, the signing of the GATT Final 
Act is expected to usher in the broadest program ever for 
reforming trade and tuning up international markets. Czech 
political leaders, as a result, are predicting increased 
import-export business at home and claiming small victories for 
the Czech domestic marketplace. 
  "I'm convinced that GATT is not only important for big 
exporters like the U.S. and Japan, but also for transitional 
countries like the Czech Republic," said Minister of Industry 
and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy at an April 22 press conference, one 
week after signing the document in Marrakesh, Morocco. 
  With expanded export possibilities, Dlouhy said, the 
country's economy is poised to begin real improvement, after 
years of falling production levels and sluggish growth during 
its transformation from a planned economy to a free market. 
  Demand on the Czech domestic market alone, with only 10 
million consumers, "will never be enough to allow for growth," 
Dlouhy said. 
  For Czech political and business leaders, economic 
liberalization has long been a rallying cry at home and abroad, 
and nowhere more so than in the government halls of foreign 
countries whose markets seemed a tad too tightly managed for 
Czech tastes. 
  One of the biggest gains for Czech producers may well be 
increased access to West European markets. The Czech Republic 
has been quietly booming on the European Union (EU) market, the 
world's largest trading area. With its heavy industrial 
background and low labor costs, the Czech Republic has become a 
serious competitor in many areas. 
  During much of GATT's long negotiating process, 
protectionist 
policies in the EU were one of the thorniest obstacles. 
Especially in agriculture, textiles and steel--three markets in 
which Czechs are strong--domestic farm subsidies and foreign 
import quotas made access, especially for the newly emerging 
economies of Central and Eastern Europe, difficult to obtain. 
  "Those are the areas where the EU protects its markets," 
said 
Kamil Cermak, a press spokesman for Dlouhy. 
  Such barriers have in the past attracted criticism from 
many, 
including GATT General Director Peter Sutherland, for leaving 
the post-Communist countries out in the cold. 
  "Many of these new democracies are fragile politically and 
economically. Their leaders have often acted with great courage 
in their policies of economic liberalization. What these 
countries need is full assimilation into the multilateral 
trading system, not rejection by the most successful 
beneficiaries of that system," Sutherland wrote in late 1993 for 
the WALL STREET JOURNAL. 
  The Uruguay Final Act will cut subsidies, quotas and tariffs 
significantly, ostensibly giving Czech products a leg up. In 
addition, the Czechs have continued to negotiate with the EU 
headquarters in Brussels, which has imposed quotas on Czech 
goods in many areas. 
  "There are improvements [already], because there is a lot of 
communication between Brussels and Prague, but GATT will help 
this," Cermak said. 
  Czech trade with the EU has soared over the last four years, 
jumping by 169 percent despite the EU's restrictions. "In 
general, Czech trade has exploded," said Gerhard Sabathil, first 
secretary of the European Commission's permanent delegation to 
the Czech Republic. "The Czech Republic is the only Central 
European country to have a trade surplus with the EU." 
  Also, with the implementation of GATT, Sabathil said, EU 
officials may modify the so-called "European Agreements," which 
form the basis of economic relations between Central and Eastern 
European countries and the EU. If, for instance, GATT dictates 
lowering a specific tariff, the agreements may be adapted to 
remain in harmony with the new levels prescribed by GATT, 
Sabathil said. 
  GATT "definitely stands to benefit us," said Milan Tomanek, 
press spokesman for the Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka (CSOB), 
which handles half of the country's export business. "The field 
where we feel we are specifically strong, traditionally strong, 
is the area of international trade." 
  For instance, Tomanek said, CSOB has already run up against 
the caps on steel exports to the EU. "The steel companies in the 
north of Moravia are clients of the bank, so we have seen a 
tremendous drop there," he said. 
  As the numbers break down, GATT will lower tariffs in 
developed countries by an average of 38 percent and leave 
approximately 40 percent of imports tariff-free. 
  The 124 members of GATT also agreed the world's major 
trading 
powers, such as the EU, Japan, the U.S. and Canada, would 
gradually eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals, construction 
equipment, medical equipment, steel, furniture, agricultural 
machinery, wood, paper, toys, beer and liquor. Also, quotas, 
which have been a thorn in the side of free traders, will be 
lifted on textile products and clothing over the next 10 years. 
  In addition, domestic subsidies for agricultural products 
will drop by an average of 20 percent over the next six years, 
while export subsidies will drop by 36 percent. To make the 
transformation complete, all non-tariff barriers, such as 
quotas, will be transformed into the form of tariffs, which will 
then be lowered on average by 36 percent. 
  In the Czech government's report on the Final Act, Dlouhy 
and 
Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec wrote that the Czech side came 
out ahead in the final results. 
  For instance, they wrote, the Czechs will lower tariffs on 
industrial goods entering the domestic market. Reduction for 
GATT member-states is one-third. After fully implementing this 
reduction, the average incidence of tariffs (i.e., the 
percentage of goods on which tariffs are levied) on the Czech 
industrial goods market, which is already relatively open to 
exports from abroad, will be roughly 3.8 percent, a figure that 
"approaches the rates of the EU," Dlouhy's report says. 
  Czech firms also stand to gain considerable market access as 
a result of the Final Act, as the developed market economies 
will either "completely eliminate tariffs on industrial products 
or reduce them to a very low level," the report says. 
  At home, however, Czech producers will not see such stiff 
reductions, says the report; since protectionism abroad and 
particularly in Western Europe has been disadvantageous to the 
Czech Republic in the past, it will not have to subject its 
businesses to outside competition as quickly. 
  "Through this approach, it has balanced out the various 
levels of market protection through tariffs, which had been up 
to now unfavorable for the Czech Republic in comparison with 
countries [with developed market economies] as a whole," the 
report claims. 
  Although in sensitive sectors such as steel exports, one of 
the Czech Republic's real powerhouses, GATT often either spreads 
out reductions in EU tariffs over long periods of time or lowers 
them less than Czech firms might want, the Czech side will still 
not have to reciprocate. 
  But Dlouhy and Zieleniec also predict that, especially in 
the 
textile and clothing markets, where domestic subsidies will drop 
by 20 percent and export subsidies by 36 percent, Czech 
producers will have to take some bad with the good. 
  Says the Czech government report: "In addition to new 
possibilities for access to markets of other countries, however, 
Czech producers must count on stiffer competition on foreign and 
domestic markets from developing countries whose exports to the 
markets of developed countries have been strongly restricted." 
  Currently, however, the Czech Republic does not have an 
extremely liberal import regime, the report says, which ought to 
lessen the impact of tariff reductions. Also, the reductions 
here will be spread over 10 years to give domestic producers a 
chance to adjust, whereas reductions elsewhere will take effect 
much more quickly. 
  The final victory for developing economies like the Czech 
Republic's, where costs for labor and outlays for social welfare 
remain low, was in persuading GATT members not to concentrate on 
"social dumping" clauses in the final agreement, said the 
Ministry of Industry and Trade's Cermak. 
  "Some West European countries and the United States want to 
talk about social conditions and labor standards," he said, "and 
that's uncomfortable for us, because that can become another 
form of protectionism." 
  GATT feared that the more developed economic players, like 
the U.S. or the EU, might insist that Czech producers were 
engaging in "social dumping"--in other words, keeping pay rates 
down at home in order to dump their goods on other markets 
cheaply. 
  "Other countries could use antidumping [measures] because 
our 
wages are very low," said Cermak. But, he added, "That's our 
biggest comparative advantage."

  [Text] Prague, June 21 (CTK) -- The Czech Republic's future 
administrative arrangement was discussed between Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus and the chairmen of the other three government 
coalition parties in separate meetings today, a source who 
requested anonymity told CTK. 
  The source said that Klaus, who is chairman of the strongest 
government coalition Civic Democratic Party (ODS), evidently 
believed it would be useful to postpone the issue of creation of 
higher self-governing units until a later date. 
  According to the timetable of legislative steps aimed at 
implementing a local government reform, which the government had 
submitted to parliament, the government is to present by June 30 
a bill on higher self-administrative units. According to the 
source, Klaus apparently believes that it would be useful if the 
bill was not submitted by this date and the parliament enabled 
the government to submit it later, "preferably never." 
  The source said that Klaus's efforts were motivated by a 
fundamental controversy between the latest decision of the ODS 
Executive Council and the coalition agreement from autumn 1992. 
  However, if the bill is not submitted to parliament before 
elections there exists clear danger that the government is 
incapable of implementing its programme and the constitution, 
the source said. 
  He allowed for the possibility that separate contacts 
between 
the coalition party chairmen would continue also in the future. 
  Asked whether a joint meeting of the so-called "Coalition 
Four" - the chairmen of all the coalition parties - is expected 
the source said that the meeting would not take place on 
Wednesday.

  [Text] Prague June 22 (CTK) -- Several dozen thousands of 
Romanies who are living in the Czech Republic, but are not Czech 
citizens will probably be viewed as foreigners as of July 1, 
1994, the independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY writes today. 
  It quotes Igor Nemec, the head of the Government Office and 
chairman of the Council for Ethnic Minorities, as telling it 
that under the Law on Czech Citizenship, the people who would 
not apply for Czech citizenship by the end of June, will get the 
statute of foreigners as of July 1, and will become subjects to 
the alien regime. 
  In 1993, the Czech Government charged district authorities 
to 
appoint advisers to people wanting to acquire Czech citizenship. 
For long months, the Romany press has been urging Romanies to 
settle the question individually, Nemec said. 
  People can also ask for Czech citizenship after June 30, but 
only as foreigners. 
  Foreigners have neither the right to social and health 
security, nor the right to vote. They are not obliged to serve 
in the Czech Army, and are allowed to run businesses only under 
special terms, the paper writes. 
  Nemec told the daily that the Romanies had found themselves 
in an absurd situation. In the past decades their problems were 
settled by the paternalistic state and they became accustomed to 
it. It is impossible for this trend to continue, Nemec stressed. 
  The daily also quotes Vaclav Trojan from the Romany section 
within the Helsinki Civic Assembly as stating that many Romanies 
will not be able to meet the conditions set by the law for 
acquiring Czech citizenship, mainly that of a five-year clean 
record. 
  LIDOVE NOVINY quotes the Czech Republic's Alien Police as 
saying it would later specify the steps to be taken towards the 
Romanies without Czech citizenship after June 30. 
  Some 200,000 Romanies are estimated to live in the Czech 
Republic, but they are migrating between the country and 
Slovakia, a habit surviving since the times of the Czechoslovak 
Federation.

<F P=106> [Article by Brendan McNally: "Without Inducements, </F>
Multinational Moves In"] 
  [Text] An international electronics company's 
decision to relocate a manufacturing facility from Germany to 
east Bohemia casts doubt on the conventional wisdom that 
governments must vie with one another--through tax breaks and 
other concessions--to attract business and industry. 
  An international electronics corporation will invest more 
than $30 million (870 million Kc) into a Czech factory, making 
it the largest British investment in this country to date. 
  AVX, a Japanese-American conglomerate with its European 
operations based in Great Britain, decided to move its 
manufacturing plant from Germany to Lanskroun, east Bohemia, 
despite the Czech government's flat refusal to provide tax 
breaks or other financial inducements. 
  Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, speaking at the official 
opening of the factory May 12, said the project's success was a 
validation of his own free-market philosophy. 
  "I am glad such a success could take place just on general 
achievements, without any help from the government. And this is 
the way we'd like to demonstrate that it's not necessary to ask 
for special advantages or for a new trade policy. I think [AVX 
Czech Republic General Manager Jiri] Skala doesn't need my help 
or my expertise, because I would not be able to give it," Klaus 
said in English to a crowd of Czech, British, Japanese and 
American company officials. 
  While clearly disappointed that the government would not 
offer help, AVX company officials already consider the project a 
success. In just three months, the factory has become one of the 
world's largest producers of tantalum chip capacitors, a 
component used in cellular telephones, hearing aids and other 
electronic products. 
  "There were no tax advantages, nothing," said Ernest 
Chilton, 
senior vice president for AVX's tantalum capacitors division. 
"Our only inducement was comparative advantage." 
  Cheaper labor costs in the Czech Republic as compared to 
Germany was one of many factors that led the company to move its 
operations to Lanskroun, Chilton said. 
  "There are places with lower labor costs than the Czech 
Republic. But if you take the skills and the education level, we 
found that this has been the best place we can come to," he said. 
  AVX's Czech and British personnel described the opening as a 
significant achievement because the factory was up and running 
in only nine months, 14 months ahead of schedule. 
  "When we made the decision to come here, we took a chance. 
We 
knew about the Czechs' great industrial tradition, but we didn't 
know if it had all been lost over the last 40 years," Chilton 
said. 
  The skill and willingness of AVX's Czech work force to solve 
the myriad problems they faced bringing the factory on line 
proved management had made the right decision, he said. 
  "Last June, we had an empty building, and in nine or 10 
months we built it up from zero," Chilton said. 
  "Bringing the factory on line was a daunting task," said 
Peter Collis, production manager for AVX Lanskroun. "Our plans 
were complex and required meeting certain deadlines without 
fail." 
  Collis characterized the modern global electronics industry 
as "a cutthroat business" in which manufacturers vie 
relentlessly to keep a competitive edge while continuing to 
maintain stringent quality control. As a rule, prices for 
components usually degrade by 15 percent each year, forcing 
manufacturers to find new ways to make parts better and more 
cheaply. This is what led AVX to Lanskroun. 
  Tesla Lanskroun had been building tantalum capacitors for 
the 
Eastern market since 1963. AVX hoped to take advantage of both 
the low labor costs and the expertise of the local work force in 
manufacturing these chips. 
  The first AVX representatives visited Tesla Lanskroun in May 
1990. Initially, the company considered a joint venture with 
Tesla, and in June 1992, AVX and Tesla signed a Tantalum 
Assembly Agreement and AVX began leasing floor space from Tesla 
for subcontracting operations. By June 1992, 400 Tesla employees 
were subcontracted over to AVX. 
  Ultimately, AVX rejected a joint venture with Tesla, 
choosing 
instead to start up its own company, AVX Czechoslovakia, which 
was headed by Skala, a former manager at Tesla. 
  "We propose to double our production in the next two years. 
It will increase our market share, but we certainly won't double 
it. The market is growing too fast," said Chilton. 
  AVX Lanskroun currently employs about 1,000 workers. 
  "The factory operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
We're only closed three days a year--Christmas, Boxing Day and 
New Years'. You can't do that in Germany," said Chilton. 
  Other Western high-tech companies may soon follow in AVX's 
footsteps, said Chilton. "For European companies, to use the 
Czech work force is a tremendous opportunity. Our biggest 
problem is learning the Czech language," he said. 
  AVX Czech Republic is a subsidiary of the U.K.-based AVX 
Europe, itself a subsidiary of the American AVX Corp., which is 
in turn a member of the Japanese Kocera Group. The Kocera group 
has some 26,000 employees worldwide and a yearly turnover of $30 
billion (870 billion Kc).

<F P=106> [Article by Keith Damsell: "Czechs and Canadians Expand </F>
Trade Opportunities"] 
  [Text] More Canadian dollars and Czech crowns may soon be 
crossing the Atlantic, thanks to two recent trade programs 
linking the two countries. 
  Fifty-four executives from some of Canada's largest 
corporations studied business opportunities here, while 22 of 
their Czech counterparts learned about exporting opportunities 
to Canada during the week of May 9-13. 
  "We've seen some good opportunities here," said David Lambe, 
head of the consulting firm David Lambe &amp; Associates, based 
in 
Ottawa, Ontario. 
  Lambe is a member of the University of Ottawa's first 
Executive MBA graduating class. During the intensive program, 
executives from the private and public sectors work at their 
regular jobs and commit an additional 30 to 55 hours per week 
attending classes and studying. The two-year program, which 
focuses on strategic and multinational management skills, 
culminated this year in a trip to the Czech Republic. For their 
final school project, small working teams put together Czech 
market entry strategies for Canadian firms. 
  In cooperation with the Canadian system-integration company 
SHL Systemhouse, Lambe's six-member team met with local 
communications experts and analyzed potential business 
opportunities here. In a detailed 35-page report, the group 
concluded the company should enter into a joint-venture 
agreement with a local Czech partner. After returning to Canada, 
the team will meet with SHL's senior management and present 
their findings. 
  "We believe there is an opportunity for SHL Systemhouse to 
make some impact in the integrated technology sector here," said 
Paul Murphy, a senior manager with the Ottawa-based 
Bell-Northern Research Ltd. 
  Another MBA exec team looked at the potential Czech market 
for the atomic energy company AECL-Candu. The four-member team 
visited AECL's nuclear reactor construction project in Romania 
and held high-level meetings with officials at the Czech state 
energy company CEZ. 
  "We're not hidden away in a classroom in downtown Ottawa," 
said Gerard Lewis, senior marketing advisor at the Canadian 
Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec. Lewis' team considered 
how Canada Post could improve its distribution and marketing 
system in comparison to the Czech postal service. "The course is 
a bridging of academic models with business practices. It's a 
chance to take those 10 to 15 years of business experience and 
put a new framework around it and then take it back out into the 
business community." 
  While the executives considered how Canadian firms might 
muscle into the Czech marketplace, the Trade Facilitation Office 
of Canada (TFOC) conducted a seminar for Czech entrepreneurs 
keen on exporting their wares to Canada. 
  The three-day seminar in Prague was the first of its kind in 
Eastern and Central Europe, said David Taylor, TFOC European 
program director and former commercial counsellor for the 
Canadian Embassy in Czechoslovakia. 
  "We decided to try it here first because we knew the Czech 
Republic had a strong industrial base," Taylor said. 
  Representatives from Czech companies as diverse as cheese 
producer Mika and forklift manufacturer Desta learned the 
intricacies of Canadian tariff and trade laws, distribution 
channels and risk management. 
  Canadians are sure to buy Becherovka, the popular Czech 
herbal liqueur, if it is available at their local liquor store, 
said Jaroslav Pokora, seminar participant and sales manager at 
SVP, a Prague-based distribution company. The company 
distributes the famous spirit in Slovakia, Hungary and Italy. 
  As a result of the seminar, Pokora is planning a future trip 
to Canada to find an export partner. 
  "When Canadian tourists visit the Czech Republic, they buy 
lots of Becherovka and take it home with them," Pokora said. 
"I'm persuaded that Canadians will like it. They know Czech 
crystal and they know Becherovka."

<F P=106> [Article by James Hilder: "Czech Republic and Germany Pave </F>
Way for Road Connection"] 
  [Text] "It's a historic flow, as important in its way as 
the Channel Tunnel," said Vaclav Purchart, pointing to maps of 
the northern section of the Czech-German border. 
  The object of such grand reflections is the planned highway 
link that will guide an estimated 80,000 vehicles over the 
border after its expected completion in the year 2002. The 
connection is a key component in the Czech government's plans to 
integrate the Czech transportation and communication systems 
into European networks. 
  In the eyes of Purchart, a deputy at the Ministry of the 
Environment, the road will complete a vital continental 
connection between Berlin and Rome. Unfortunately, there is 
still no decision on exactly where the Czech dalnice will meet 
the German Autobahn. 
  The planned road is giving Czech officials a permanent 
headache due to the nature of the area it will cross. It must 
avoid the urban conurbation of Teplice and skirt the nature 
preserves of the Ore Mountains while not disrupting the 
activities of northern Bohemia's heavy industries. 
  Purchart has not had an easy job. "People still think of the 
environment as just trees, whereas it is really an integrated 
overview of numerous elements," he said. 
  In fact, the environment was not viewed in legal terms at 
all 
until a new law was introduced in March 1992 to limit the 
damaging effects of construction on surrounding areas. This 
forced engineers working on the road link to rethink their 
plans, which they had been developing on purely technical 
grounds, and led to the commissioning of a report from the 
Environment Ministry. 
  Purchart and his department have narrowed the possible 
routes 
to a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) strip north of Teplice, between the 
Czech village of Krupka and the German village of Furstenau. 
They now have to decide between a tunnel crossing and an 
above-ground highway. 
  Purchart favors two tunnel variants, between one-half and 
five kilometers long, but admits that these are almost twice as 
expensive as surface roadway. "The surface route would have to 
be longer, though, so costs could level out," said Purchart. 
  The Germans are not so plagued by doubts. Last week, the 
Saxon regional government approved a DM 1.8 billion ($1.05 
billion) budget along with a route that will lead from Dresden 
via the border communities of Liebenau and Breitenau to the area 
designated by the Czech-Saxon working group. 
  "The German side presented less geographical problems, 
rising 
slowly to the hilly border region," said Purchart. "The Czech 
side is steeper and more populated, and therefore more 
problematic." 
  Milan Machart at the Ministry of Transportation said it will 
be at least two years before the site for the international link 
is finalized. His department's ultimate plan is for the major 
Czech cities to be connected by high-speed roads to Germany, 
Austria, Poland and Slovakia, providing cheaper services for 
international north-south and east-west traffic. In addition, 
road-building and service industries are expected to alleviate 
the unemployment problems in certain border areas. 
  The highway expansion program is estimated to cost 100 
billion Kc ($3.3 billion) in its entirety, a sum to be raised by 
bank loans and an annual road-users' fee of 400 Kc, to be 
introduced in January 1995. Given the extent of the planned 
development, Purchart said he prefers that the Environment 
Ministry maintain active cooperation with construction engineers 
rather than vetoing plans as they develop.

<F P=106> [Article by Gary Byrd: "Government Doing an Environmental </F>
Balancing Act"] 
  [Text] The Czech government is walking an environmental 
tightrope between hindering the country's industrial 
productivity and making noticeable improvements in its neglected 
ecology. 
  Industrial giants and government ministries have relied on 
environmental consultants to gather information that will answer 
vexing questions on the state of the Czech environment. Some of 
these companies appear on THE PRAGUE POST list of largest 
environmental consulting firms. 
  "The government is still debating the laws it passed in 
1992," said Roman Vyhnanek, director of Czech Environment 
Management Center. "The problem is they don't want to talk to 
industries." 
  The Ministry of Environment is in the process of defining 
and 
creating new environmental laws, but companies complain that 
current requirements are stiff and impose a financial burden 
they cannot afford if they are to remain competitive. 
  One step in the privatization process for companies is to 
outline methods of waste management that are in compliance with 
the Environment Ministry's standards. Current pollution 
reduction in Czech cities is directly related to these recently 
privatized companies, according to Minister Frantisek Benda. 
  Industry watchers, however, said that the slowdown in 
industrial production in the last several years is the primary 
cause of the slightly cleaner air. 
  Consultants and government officials agree that air 
pollution 
in the cities is the most dangerous short-term environmental 
hazard the country faces. And the brown coal mined in northwest 
Bohemia is one of the most serious pollutants. 
  "The greatest problem is that almost every large power plant 
in the Czech Republic burns tons and tons of coal," said Jiri 
Herstus, director of Aplikovana geotechnika a ekologie (AGE). 
"With the use of desulfurization stations, pollution wouldn't be 
nearly as bad." 
  AGE, like many environmental consulting firms, works 
primarily in the mining industry, assessing the impact of coal 
mining on groundwater, air and soil. Herstus said CEZ, the 
national energy company, is looking for alternatives to mining, 
but meanwhile much land is being spoiled. 
  Even though the problem is well-defined, solutions remain 
elusive. 
  The current Czech government must reach deep into its 
coffers 
to find the cash to pay for four decades of neglect. In its 1994 
budget, the government allocated 1.2 billion Kc ($41.4 million), 
about 3 percent of the overall budget, for environmental 
projects. Cleaning up the Czech environment will cost much more 
than that. 
  "There are still big holes in the environmental solution," 
said Herstus. 
  Communists chose factory locations for their accessibility 
to 
raw materials, without regard to effects on local environments. 
Industrial waste contaminated rivers and groundwater, polluted 
the air and fouled the land. Environmental laws existed under 
the former regime, but fines were minimal and violations were 
often overlooked. 
  Consultants on this week's list work primarily with giant 
industrial companies, such as CEZ and the automaker Skoda, or 
with departments within the government. These large 
organizations have the funds to implement cleaner operations; 
and, in many cases, the larger firms are the worst environmental 
offenders. 
  Much consulting work is in the form of surveys and 
fact-finding efforts, since there is little reliable information 
on the Czech environment. Once a body of research has been built 
up, the government will be able to assess better the magnitude 
of the problem. 
  Municipalities and factories hire companies to explain the 
current environmental laws and suggest ways to remain within 
governmental standards while maximizing output. Consultants must 
stay atop all environmental legislation because clients' 
concerns run the gamut--waste management, groundwater 
contamination, soil contamination, air pollution and overall 
environmental impact. 
  Environmental laws today differ from their communist 
predecessors "because before there were laws but no governmental 
agency to enforce them," said Denisa Kratochvilova, a consultant 
with KZT. "Now we have the Czech Environmental Inspection 
Agency." 
  Kratochvilova added that it is natural for companies to 
change only when threatened with substantial fines from the 
government. The trick is to sway companies to comply with the 
environmental laws without breaking their backs.

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Jun (MTI) -- As reported earlier, the 
nearly two week-long, six-party talks preparing for the founding 
session of the new Parliament ended in Budapest on Tuesday. At 
a press conference after the talks, representatives stressed the 
consensus-forming nature of the discussions, and also that the 
opposition parties received greater participation in the various 
committees than they were entitled to by election percentages. 
  During the May elections, six parties won seats in the 
386-member Parliament: the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP; 
54.15 percent -- 209 MPs [members of parliament]), the Alliance 
of Free Democrats (SZDSZ; 17.87 -- 69 MPs), the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF; 9.84 -- 38 MPs), the Independent 
Smallholders' Party (FKGP; 6.74 -- 26 MPs), the Christian 
Democratic People's Party (KDNP; 5.7 -- 22 MPs), and the 
Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz: 5.18 -- 20 MPs). The 
Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of Free Democrats are 
expected to form a governing coalition. 
  The speaker of Parliament will be an MSZP politician, and 
the 
three deputy speaker posts will be filled by SZDSZ, MDF and FKGP 
politicians respectively, based on election results. The SZDSZ, 
MDF and the FKGP will be able to nominate one notary each, with 
the KDNP and FIDESZ receiving two notary posts each. 
  The negotiating delegations also agreed that the new 
parliament would have 17 committees. Six particularly important 
committees will have 27 members: the Constitutional, the 
Budget, the Local Government, the Foreign Affairs, the Economic, 
and the Agricultural Committees. The Defence, the Welfare, the 
Environmental Protection, the Cultural, the Human Rights, and 
the Educational Committees will have 19 members each, with 15 
MPs in the European Integration Committee, and 13 MPs each in 
the Auditing, Employment, and Labour Committees. The National 
Security Committee will have 9 members. The Immunity and 
Mandate Committee will have 8 MPs. 
  Under the new parliamentary committee system, there will be 
a 
total of 334 committee members. An agreement was also reached 
regarding the distribution of committee chairmen and deputy 
chairmen. Accordingly, the MSZP will chair 9 committees; the 
SZDSZ, three; and the opposition parties, five. 
  The opposition parties will control 12 deputy committee 
chairman posts instead of the 9 due to them according to the 
numeric proportion of votes which they received. 
  The MSZP will chair the Economic, the Welfare, the 
Environmental Protection, the Cultural and Press, the Human 
Rights, the Educational, the Agricultural, the Audit, and the 
Immunity and Mandate Committees. 
  The SZDSZ will chair the Constitutional, the Foreign 
Affairs, 
and the Defence Committees. 
  The MDF will provide the chairman for the Budget and 
Financial, and the National Security Committees. 
  The FKGP has received the chairmanship of the Local 
Government Committee, a KDNP MP will chair the Employment and 
Labour Committee, and an Fidesz MP will preside over the 
European Integration Committee.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 Jun (MTI) -- Hungarian Prime Minister 
Peter Boross met Gyula Horn, prime minister designate of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, and Ivan Peto, Chairman of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, at Parliament today. 
  After the hour-long consultation, Horn told journalists that 
the topics discussed included having the two deputy presidents 
leave Hungarian Radio and Hungarian Television. The deputies 
have been in charge of broadcasting since a dispute last year 
where both the TV and Radio presidents resigned amid allegations 
of bias. The prime minister announced some days ago that he 
would start the process of relieving deputies Laszlo Csucs and 
Gabor Nahlik. 
  "This job has to be done by the government in office," Horn 
said. "The prime minister promised that he would submit a 
proposal for relieving the deputy presidents to the 
parliamentary committee concerned. Until a new government is 
formed, the two broadcasting offices will be temporarily headed 
by commissioners, Horn said. 
  Peto added "this would be a reassuring solution for the few 
days until the new government appoints new media leaders."

  [Text] Budapest, 21 Jun (MTI) -- Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz and Slovak President Michal Kovac believe an unexpected 
opportunity has arisen for their countries to reach a historic 
reconciliation, and they wish to closely cooperate in order to 
attain this aim. The two presidents, who are currently visiting 
the United States, had breakfast together on Tuesday at their 
common residence, the Ritz Carlton Hotel, prior to leaving for 
their meeting with President Bill Clinton. 
  After the working breakfast, Goncz and Kovac said in a 
statment that reconciliation was made more difficult by mutually 
established misunderstandings about relations between the two 
countries. In their view, the first misunderstanding is that 
the wounds which Hungarians and Slovaks have caused to each 
other are too deep to heal quickly. 
  However, the reality is that the two nations have lived side 
by side for many centuries, in spite of the conflicts, and have 
enriched each other both materially and culturally. The 
presidents stressed their firm resolve to overcome psychological 
obstacles in the way of cooperation. 
  According to their joint statement, the second 
misunderstanding, often used for advantage by extremist 
elements, is that the minorities could endanger the unity and 
integrity of the individual countries. The statement declares 
that the presidents are convinced that ethnic linguistic and 
cultural diversity is beneficial not only for their countries, 
but for international relations as well. 
  Presidents Goncz and Kovac added that the sole authentic and 
effective minority policy must be based on international law and 
the measures set down in the approved international documents 
relating to minorities. They also stressed that a proper 
approach could disperse all misunderstandings. 
  Presidents Goncz and Kovac voiced their readiness to support 
the enforcement of minority rights and to mutually work toward 
elevating cooperation between their states to a new standard. 

    They are of the opinion that a readiness for closer ties is 
beginning to emerge in both countries. "We support the efforts 
of the political leaders in our countries to intensify bilateral 
cooperation and to reach agreement in the matter of a contract 
which -- based on respect for territorial integrity and the 
existing borders -- will guarantee good neighbourly relations 
and minority rights in both countries," they stated. 
  The presidents also called attention to the fact that 
intensifying bilateral relations could promote the integration 
of Hungary and Slovakia into the western economic, political and 
security structure. 
  President Goncz and President Kovac believe that the 
distinction which is to be conferred on them by the Institute 
for East-West Studies indicates that the United States 
understands and appreciates these efforts, while the meeting 
scheduled with President Bill Clinton demonstrates that the U.S. 
Administration supports the goals of the two countries.

Cooperation Zone opened on Tuesday, 21 June, morning in 
Bucharest with a ceremony attended by Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu. 
  In his address President Iliescu said that just three years 
after launching, the Black Sea economic cooperation was on a 
developing way to become a genuine subregional organization. 
  "Promoting actively the principles of the Conference for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe [CSCE] and of the United 
Nations Charter, it is contributing to the creation of new 
opportunities for integration in the Euro-Atlantic space. I 
hope that the meeting in Bucharest will represent an important 
step in finding and employing the community of interests favored 
by the vicinity of the Black Sea," said the Romanian president. 
  President Iliescu expressed his confidence that once the 
problems generated by the transition in the new states of the 
zone are surpassed, and the problems caused by the lack of 
infrastructure, institutions, and managers at micro-economic 
level are solved, then the economic cooperation of the Black Sea 
would manage to succeed in building a "unity in diversity" as a 
basis for future economic projects able to bring a contribution 
to the political and economic stability in the area, and to 
ensure a climate of peace and understanding. 
  "This is, ultimately, our common interest in whose 
realization we have not only the right, but also the duty to 
engage ourselves with all our forces, with all the intellectual 
ability of each of our countries," said President Iliescu. 
  The Romanian head of state said that in the achievement of 
this goal an important role is to be plaid by diplomacy, which 
gains multiple dimensions, including an important, necessary, 
and useful parliamentary component. 
  The fact that the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Zone has succeeded in such a short period 
of time in creating its own structures within the economic zone 
represents a contribution to the promotion of a climate of 
trust, favorable to cooperation, and to the stimulation of the 
governments in proving flexibility and realism, said the 
Romanian president. 
  "In spite of the cultural and economic diversity, which 
sometimes bars collaboration, the Black Sea states have solely 
the chance of cooperation, are destined, in a positive manner, 
of course, to develop tight cooperation. At the same time, 
Europe cannot be conceived without this area, the west European 
countries cannot ignore this region of big economic interest, 
which is representing at the same time a very important 
potential of collaboration in all fields and a bridge to other 
geographic zones of high interest," said President Ion Iliescu. 
  "Romania has supported from the very beginning and in the 
most active manner the cooperation idea between the countries 
situated on the shores of the Black Sea and continues to assign 
to it increased importance as a connecting factor in the 
promotion of the general European cooperation, in extending the 
North-South cooperation, the cooperation between the Western 
world and the Middle East and, last but not least, between 
Europe and Asia," said President Iliescu. 
  "I hope that the current meeting will represent, along with 
a 
valuable contribution to the consolidation of the parliamentary 
component of the economic cooperation of the Black Sea, also an 
important step in the promotion of a climate of understanding 
and tolerance, in the achievement of a strengthened regional 
stability, in preventing the conflict situations, for the 
development of the region, and, last but not least, for closer 
relations among our countries," said Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- The proceedings of 
the third plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone began on Tuesday, 21 June, 
in Bucharest. 
  Adrian Nastase, the speaker of the Romanian Chamber of 
Deputies, emphasized in his address to the opening meeting that 
the session was a special one, as it was attended by all the 
member states of the organization of Economic Cooperation of the 
Black Sea, as well as by Bulgaria and Greece, two countries that 
did not adhere so far to the parliamentary assembly, but enjoy 
the status of observers. 
  The presence of the delegations of the eleven member states 
of the organization is ensuring the necessary framework for the 
development of the regional cooperation through the 
harmonization of the legislation in the economic, social, and 
cultural fields, said Adrian Nastase. 
  One of the main responsibilities of the organization is to 
ensure a new age of security and peace in the Black Sea zone, 
based on economic cooperation, said the organization's president 
Husamettin Cindoruk, president of the Turkish National Assembly. 
  Stressing the fact that the decisions of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Organization are addressing the governments 
of the member states, while the decisions of the parliamentary 
assembly of the said organization is addressing the parliaments 
of the member states, Aleksandr Chikvaidze, the Georgian foreign 
affairs minister, pleaded for the complementary functioning of 
the two bodies. 
  In this manner, the recommendations of the parliamentary 
assembly are expected to facilitate the implementation of the 
decisions taken by the Black Sea Economic Cooperation 
Organization. One of the projects that can benefit from this 
cooperation is the establishment of a trade and development bank 
of the Black Sea, a financial institution meant to support 
regional economic cooperation.

  [Text] Bucharest, June 22 (CTK) -- The Czech and Romanian 
presidents, Vaclav Havel and Ion Iliescu, signed today a treaty 
of friendship and cooperation between their countries. 
  At a following press conference Havel said the agreement was 
culmination of the traditionally good and well developing 
bilateral relations, and at the same time a basis for further 
cooperation to be also supported by an agreement on a free-trade 
zone, which is to be signed by the two countries' premiers in 
autumn. 
  Iliescu pointed to the long and extraordinarily positive 
tradition of Czech-Romanian relations, and to the events of 
1968, when Romania was the only country of the communist East 
Europe to openly oppose the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. 
Iliescu confirmed that the Czech-Romanian relations would 
mainly include economic cooperation. 
  Havel said he had invited Iliescu to visit the Czech 
Republic. 
  Asked whether or not Romania was interested in joining the 
Visegrad group (the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and 
Slovakia), Iliescu said that it was rather interested in getting 
closer to the Central European Initiative (the above four 
countries, and Austria, Italy, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and Slovenia). 
  Later today Havel is to meet with Czechs living in Romania 
and Czech diplomatic staff in Bucharest.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 20/6/1994 -- Oliviu Gherman, the 
president of the Romanian Senate met Monday, 20 June, with the 
president of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, Petru 
Lucinschi. 
  The guest presented the situation in the Republic of Moldova 
at the moment, and expressed the view that in the question of 
his country's relations with Romania one should be able to 
overcome the emotional approach and replace it with a pragmatic 
attitude. The sides agreed on the necessity of developing 
closer parliamentary ties forged through direct contacts between 
the standing committees of the two legislative bodies. 
  The president of the Romanian Senate, Oliviu Gherman, also 
met Monday, 20 June, with the president of the Grand National 
Assembly of Turkey, Husamettin Cindoruk. 
  Messrs. Gherman and Cindoruk approached matters regarding 
the 
bilateral ties and the activities of the economic cooperation of 
the Black Sea, with a stress on the prospects the parliamentary 
assembly of this organization offers to the member states. 
  The sides agreed that if willing to develop long-lasting 
economic relations, the partners must base their actions on a 
firm political will for cooperation and understanding. The 
political stability of the member countries, the guest 
underlined, will ensure the economic stability as a natural 
consequence. Mr. Cindoruk emphasized that everything must be 
done to stop the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, while 
ensuring the unity of Georgia.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- Gheorghe Tinca, 
the Romanian national defense minister, returned home after 
official visits to the United States and Portugal. On arrival 
at the Otopeni Airport, Mr. Tinca said the two tours abroad had 
ended with positive results. "What counts is that now I feel a 
stronger sense of responsibility than I used to have before my 
departure, and that is because the results of these visits 
invite us to proceed as fast as possible to concrete actions. 
The time for statements and shows of will is gone, in my 
opinion. People expect us to join very palpable cooperation 
actions," Mr. Tinca said.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 21/6/1994 -- During the Tuesday, 
21 June, debates in the plenum of the lower house [Chamber of 
Deputies] the National Romanian Unity Party [PUNR] took the side 
of the opposition when voting for an amendment that stipulates 
that the state budget must apportion at least 4 percent of the 
gross domestic product (GDP) to education. 
  Finance Minister Florin Georgescu in agreement with Dan 
Martian, the leader of the ruling Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR] parliamentary group, objected to the stipulation 
by law of the percentage allotted to education and sustained 
instead the amendment proposed by Dan Martian, which only spells 
that the real growth of the GDP ratio apportioned to education 
is compulsory, without specifying it. The 1994 state budget law 
earmarked 2.7 percent of the GDP to education.

  [Text] Tirana, June 22 (ATA) -- On its way to Romania, the 
Albanian delegation led by the speaker of the parliament, Pjeter 
Arbnori, stopped over in Skopje on June 18 and had a meeting 
with the speaker of the Macedonian Parliament, Andov. Mr. 
Arbnori stressed that frequent meetings are important because 
they help strengthen the relations and open new ways for 
cooperation. 
  Mr. Andov expressed the readiness of the Macedonian party to 
follow this road, with the aim that the relations between the 
two countries must set an example to the Balkan peninsula. 
  Further on Mr. Arbnori expressed some concerns with regard 
to 
the red tape obstacles related with the census of the Albanian 
population, about which he was informed in the meetings that he 
had had with Albanians in Tetovo. Mr. Arbnori asked from Mr. 
Andov to use his authority to help in the quickest and 
satisfactory possible solution of the problems that have aroused 
in the process of the census of the population in The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. 
  Mr. Andov promised and guaranteed the Albanian party a quick 
solution. Further on, Mr. Andov focused on the promotion of the 
economic and trade relations between the two countries which is 
important for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the 
conditions of the blockade imposed by Greece. Mr. Arbnori 
expressed the readiness and interest of Albania in this point, 
stressing that Albania is ready to go ahead in this direction 
not because the problem is related with Greece but because 
cooperation and the intensification of regional trade and 
economic relations is the only road towards stability and 
prosperity.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Svetlana Belousova: "Elections as Fiction"] </F>
  [Text] The leaders of the two major political forces have 
had a second official tete-a-tete meeting. The first meeting 
failed to produce any public results; it only helped Zhan 
Videnov legitimize his position as leader of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party [BSP]. However, it was that meeting that served 
as the cornerstone of his current -- and after the congress -- 
future political career. Aleksandur Lilov, Andrey Lukanov, Nora 
Ananieva, and certain smaller self-proclaimed leaders remained 
in his shadow. In this context, the second meeting was a 
reciprocal diplomatic act that aimed to convince the Union of 
Democratic Forces [SDS] that Filip Dimitrov is its only leader. 
Whether he will be able to utilize his position in the upcoming 
events or mess things up until they become fully unclear, which 
is typically the case, is a different issue. 
  Against the background of the expanding political cacophony, 
which has been brought on by the idleness of the two political 
centers rather than by any action on their part, Videnov and 
Dimitrov could not meet in order "to discuss the political 
situation" -- one of the contemporary politicians' new cliches. 
They were expected to discuss the Election Bill and the 
amendments to the Constitution, and it was precisely this that 
they announced at the news conference as the main topic. Being 
led by considerations of "political expediency" -- another 
cliche -- became one of the fundamental principles of our 
politicians. 
  At their news conference, Videnov and Dimitrov firmly 
explained that there are differences in the manner in which the 
two centers view the elections issue. Actually, neither the BSP 
nor the SDS are ready for early elections in the fall. 
Furthermore, they do not want the elections. Naturally, it is 
not advantageous to admit this to the voters nor is it 
"expedient." Now is not the time for this, as both parties need 
time. They are absolutely sure that the division in the next 
parliament will again be between the blue [SDS] and the red 
[BSP], and the difference will only be in the satellite 
political formations. This is precisely why the two major 
parties need time. Forming a new centrist coalition and 
expanding the constituency of the Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms -- these are goals whose implementation requires time.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Oil Pipeline for Greece Through </F>
Bulgaria Planned"] 
  [Text] The construction of a Bulgarian-Greek oil pipeline 
from Burgas to the Aegean port of Alexandroupolis, an idea 
launched last month during the talks in Moscow between Greek 
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin, will neutralize Turkey's oil ambitions in the region. 
In addition, such a project will resolve the problem of 
transporting the Russian oil to Western Europe, the I 
KATHIMERINI Greek daily writes. 
  The oil pipeline, which will pass through southern Bulgaria, 
is also viewed as an opportunity to stop the expansionist 
strivings of Turkey in the region, in which 1.5 million Muslims 
live, and strengthen security in Thrace, I KATHIMERINI writes. 
  Athens views the idea of constructing a Greek-Bulgarian oil 
pipeline from the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea as a counterpoint 
to the Turkish strategic plans aimed at establishing eventual 
control over the export of Russian oil. According to Athens, 
Turkey also aims at establishing control over the oil of the 
former Soviet republics around the Caspian Sea. 
  By constructing the Greek-Bulgarian oil pipeline Russia 
would 
be able to free itself from its dependence on Turkey and 
simultaneously, the strategic positions of Greece and Bulgaria 
will be strengthened.

<F P=106> [Article by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Between the </F>
Past and the Future"] 
  [Text] In the period after November 1989, we did not draw 
once and for all a thick line under the past (so that we could 
forget it), but we decided intentionally to remove the main 
instigators of the communist regime from all public positions 
and, moreover, to redress the aftermath of the most serious 
property and nonproperty-related injustices committed by this 
regime. We accommodated the majority view among the Czech 
public, and that was the right thing to do. However, I would 
like to say that, from the very beginning, we were aware of the 
difficulties and problems this decision would bring on a 
practical level and of the kind of genie that was being released 
from the bottle. I think we have done more in this issue than 
any other postcommunist country. Despite this, it seems to me 
that the current dissatisfaction of some people (and mainly its 
disproportionate representation in the media) with the alleged 
slowness, inconsistency, and small scale of the rehabilitations 
and restitutions is increasing directly proportionately to the 
extent of the rehabilitations carried out and with the amount of 
property already returned, and this is the reason for my 
contemplation. 
  I do not want to deal at all with the economic aspect of the 
issue. This has already been discussed enough in our country, 
and it is not the main issue, although it is certainly not a 
negligible one. The issue involves something far broader and 
far more general--that is, what the past in fact means for the 
life of the state and the nation or, rather, the extent to which 
it is possible to rectify it or take it back. 
  Many people in our country view the communist regime as a 
kind of weight that descended on all of us from the outside in 
1948. Therefore, it also seems to them that, when we managed to 
haul this weight off ourselves, we were once again in the early 
evening of 24 February 1948, and, if not entirely, we must 
strive with all our might and as fast as possible to be there. 
This is only half the truth, however, and it may even be less. 
  In actuality, the communist era meant a profound structural 
transformation throughout the whole of Czech society, not only 
on the ideological level but also on the everyday one. Society 
stratified thanks to the previous democratic regime into a 
multitude of local, regional, social, ethnic, and mainly 
enormously multifarious special-interest groups that differed 
from each other not only in the extent of their wealth and 
political influence but also in their sundry life styles; 
communism forcibly cemented them together in false unity, 
dreariness, and injustice. The objective of communist ideology 
was the collectivization of society, whose end result, however, 
was its considerable atomization. This severed the thousands of 
fine threads that wove us together. This was one of the most 
profound social transformations that our country has gone 
through in its thousand-year history; moreover, it was amplified 
by the fact that the conditions that evolved lasted for two 
whole generations. 
  It was not, however, external intervention. A not 
insignificant part of our society, whether consciously or 
unconsciously, was involved in organizing this transformation 
and in carrying it out. The gradual sobering up, which set in as 
a result of the public disclosure of the Stalinist terror and of 
the subsequent collapse of communist ideology itself, could not, 
even in 1968, be fully implemented politically because of the 
nature of the already stabilized regime. This was accompanied, 
into the bargain, by further mistakes and further illusions. 
Let us admit finally that communism was not a natural disaster 
but was more like a serious and prolonged illness against which 
we did not have enough antitoxins. 
  It follows on from this that, among other things, each of us 
who went through this process, albeit quite involuntarily, is 
marked by it, no matter what he tells himself. The spasmodic 
disputes and polemics whipped up by the sudden and unexpectedly 
obtained freedom are convincing proof of this, and the current 
restitution mania is part of it. 
  It is naive to think that we will simply replicate our 
future 
from our more illustrious past. On the one hand, we are 
somewhere else, and, on the other, we do not know what our more 
illustrious past is, this paradise lost to which we want to 
return. Are these the years immediately before 1948, years noted 
for their diverse violations of human and civil rights, their 
crippled political spectrum and mass nationalization? Or is 
this the interwar Czech Republic, more than half a century 
remote from us? Or is it perhaps even the imperial and royal 
monarchy? 
  Without a doubt, we must follow up on our positive 
historical traditions. At the same time, the current 
fundamental framework for a free society as it has evolved in 
Europe is also decisive for us. However, these are just 
auxiliary bearings. We have to create our future ourselves; we 
cannot replicate it. It will be new, it will be ours, and it 
will be different from what we know of our past or of that of 
our neighbors. The road toward it is untraveled. It is a road 
"on which one gets dusty," a bumpy road, and a road with sharp 
bends and steep slopes. A concept for a return to "the time 
before" is impossible. The river of time will not flow 
backwards, even if we were to pass hundreds of laws and 
government decrees for this purpose. 
  From time to time it is also said "give back what was 
stolen." This, at first glance attractive moral imperative is, 
upon closer inspection, terribly ungenerous and terribly 
improvident. Among other things, the one who stole is not the 
one who gives back. The individual also harmed by communism is, 
in the overwhelming majority of cases, the one who gives back. 
Each of us who trots out this demand should realize what it 
means in practice. Quite unnecessary disputes will erupt, and 
are already erupting, and these could become a barrier 
separating us from each other and dividing us all from our 
neighbors. The passionate debates about returning property to 
an aristocrat or the property claims of the Sudeten Germans are 
classic examples of this. Moreover, I do not believe that the 
major injustices of communism were property-related injustices 
or that we should orient ourselves in this direction. 
  Only the future will tell whether we made the right decision 
when we chose our "Czech" solution to rectify the wrongdoing 
committed by the communist regime. However, the present is 
already sending us clear and comprehensible signals that it is 
necessary to bring an end to more and more restitution claims. 
We will not settle scores with the past any better by their 
continuous augmentation.

<F P=106> [Article by Jiri Stastny: "The Czech Republic Exported Arms </F>
to 53 Countries Last Year"] 
  [Text] The Czech Republic exported arms and special 
military material to 53 countries last year. Egypt and Thailand 
were among the most significant importers of our aircraft 
hardware. We exported small arms mainly to Turkey, where the 
Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod rearmed the police force. We 
sold seven ground armored vehicles to Angola. 
  Bretislav Gregr, the director of the Special Materials 
Department at the Trade and Industry Ministry, told us that the 
provision of import and export licenses for military material is 
the basic condition for conducting international trade in arms. 
A license is issued on the basis of an application, the most 
important detail of which is the confirmation of the end user; 
this is verified by the representative offices. At the moment, 
the situation is more complicated because a new law on 
conducting foreign trade in military material has been in force 
since 1 April. It stipulates a two-tier licensing procedure. 
First, a company must apply for a general permit to enter onto 
the market with military material, a permit that entitles it to 
supply, market, or enter into tender proceedings. The holder of 
this permit must then apply for a license for each specific deal 
he wants to complete. A company must comply with a number of 
conditions before being issued a general permit. The company in 
question must, for example, have a majority share of Czech 
capital, its owners must be Czech citizens with permanent 
residence in the Czech Republic, and they need to have a 
negative screenings certificate, a clean criminal record, 
sufficient financial backing for the company, and so on. At the 
moment, some 10 enterprises are applying for this permit; one of 
them has already obtained it. According to B. Gregr, it is a 
new limited company whose statutory bodies had Army connections 
and, thus, knowledge of the military sphere. The new wording of 
the law allows for the validity of the licenses issued 
previously. Some 40 companies that obtained a license to export 
military material before 1 April of this year have to obtain a 
new export permit within six months. These companies include, 
for example, Aero Vodochody, whose shipment for the Thai Royal 
Air Force was impounded recently in Austria.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Havligerova and Tomas Marek: "Problems </F>
Being Experienced by Banks Are Reaching Deeper Than Errors in 
Management"] 
  [Text] After two banks collapsed financially, the 
nervousness of the public is palpable at every step. The failure 
of the Credit and Industrial Bank of Prague and the subsequent 
closing of the Bohemia Bank brought about defensive reflexes 
within society; the confidence of the populace in the entire 
system is melting away like ice in the summer sun. 
  The nervousness is currently concentrated upon the so-called 
small banks, which are those that have recently come into being 
and whose basic worth is about 1 billion korunas [Kc] or beneath 
that level. On the other hand, large institutions are perceived 
as being safe and secure. 
  Except that this is also a matter for discussion. Not even 
the giant posthumous children of the monopolistic financial 
system that existed under the socialist economy are in "as cozy 
a situation" as it may seem. Recently, reports reached the 
public regarding some of their heavy mistakes--for example, the 
payment of a forged check for Kc60 million by the Bank of 
Commerce and a mistake involving precious gemstones that, 
provided it is confirmed, could cost the Investment and Postal 
Bank Kc500 million. Experience indicates that only a fraction of 
what goes on in the banks ever reaches the public eye. 
Accordingly, one cannot only figure that even the large 
institutions engage in failed ventures, but also that there will 
very likely be more such ventures than have currently become 
known. 
  The current lack of confidence in small banks is, moreover, 
nurtured by uncertain reports regarding their uncertain 
financial situation. And so a single exemplary case is 
sufficient. And two failures within the short period of six 
months--that is simply too much. And what today's published 
report regarding the difficulties being experienced by the AB 
Bank will be cannot even be estimated. 
  For purposes of confidence in the system, it is immaterial 
that both cases--the Bohemia and the Credit and Industrial 
Bank--are special cases and do not have a whole lot in common 
with pure banking. In the case of the Credit and Industrial 
Bank, this is obviously a matter of fraudulent activity to 
benefit selected clients of the institution; in the case of the 
Bohemia Bank, the culprit was illegal foreign operations by part 
of the management of the firm. 
  The Czech National Bank has hardened conditions for doing 
business in the industry in recent months. It increased its 
oversight over individual institutions, imposed higher standards 
that banking houses must meet. Thanks to this move, six 
institutions are now under heightened control--the Czech 
National Bank assigns them tasks and makes recommendations to 
their management teams and compels them to strengthen the 
financial position of their bank. 
  When the business boom began in 1990 and in the subsequent 
years, it turned out that the large institutions were far too 
cumbersome, do not know how to expand their services with 
sufficient speed, and are proving ineffective in terms of 
distributing their resources--in other words, lending money 
where there is an interest in such loans. And small and medium 
business entrepreneurs were interested. There was more demand 
for loans, which exceeded the supply of available money. In 
other words, the large corporations were not striving in any way 
to attract this clientele. The market reacted in a natural 
way--small and medium-size banks began to come into being. 
  However, since that time, the situation has changed. The 
supply of money has increased and is probably even greater than 
the demand for new credits today. The large banks were also 
faced with tough competition--a number of enterprises that had a 
reputation and good plans turned their backs on them and their 
high interest rates. They either borrowed money abroad or issued 
bonds. The large banks began to find that the world is not only 
colored a rosy pink and had to begin paying attention even to 
those clients whom the black-garbed sheriffs never even allowed 
in the building before. Of course, this is contributing to the 
worries of the small banks--in order to succeed, they must lower 
their loan rates. And this is precisely a problem for them. 
  When the small banks needed money for credits, they were 
compelled to acquire primary resources, the best of which were 
time deposits from the populace and from enterprises. And 
persuading a customer to deposit money precisely with their 
institution meant paying higher interest rates than were being 
paid by the large institutions. 
  In other words, the small banks were offering better 
conditions for depositing money, and, consequently, on the other 
hand, they also made more costly loans. As the interest of the 
large institutions is expanding, so the operating room of the 
smaller ones is shrinking--and the fact that they apparently 
have more pleasant personnel, are more flexible, etc. does not 
alter much in this situation. The fundamental economic rule of 
price will have its way. 
  Thus, the small banks have no choice but to rapidly become 
larger. Many are working arduously at this task--never before 
have there been so many reports regarding increases in basic 
worth that have followed each other so rapidly as has been the 
case in recent months. But that will not be enough. The Czech 
National Bank, which is guarding the health of the banking 
sector, knows very well that the structure of the financial 
institutions is unsuitable and is planning to bring about a 
change in the structure through new regulations. And so there 
will clearly soon be a wave of mergers and fusions involving the 
smaller banking houses. Overall, perhaps the number of banks 
will shrink, but this is not a pity. For this price, the 
financial institutions will buy back the confidence of the 
population, which they had lost in part.

  [Text] Prague--Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan has 
asserted that Syria is a primary and important state in the 
Middle East and that, without Syria, a just and comprehensive 
peace cannot be achieved. 
  In a statement to a SANA correspondent in Prague today, 
Kukan 
added that his country appreciates the Syrian policy aimed at 
achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region. He also 
emphasized Slovakia's support for the peace process, which is 
based on both the UN resolutions and international legitimacy. 
  The Slovak minister stressed the depth of Syrian-Slovak 
relations, which have always been fruitful in all fields. He 
said his coming visit to Damascus on the day after tomorrow, 24 
June, aims to promote and consolidate the traditional relations 
between Syria and Slovakia in a way that will serve both 
friendly countries.

  [Text] Zvolen--The 18 June meeting of the Communist Party 
of Slovakia [KSS] Central Committee approved a proposal to hold 
the communist celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Slovak 
National Uprising on 20 August in Holic, in the presence of 
representatives of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. 
The KSS Central Committee also approved the party's electoral 
manifesto, the submitted KSS slate of candidates for the 
parliamentary elections, and the election staff. KSS Chairman 
V. Dado will be the Communists' main leader in the coming 
elections. The meeting also dealt with cadre issues--M. Zozulak, 
J. Sevc, and Anton Porubsky were elected KSS deputy 
chairmen--and assessed some aspects of domestic and foreign 
policy. The KSS Central Committee resolutely protests against 
Zbigniew Brzezinski's call that nuclear weapons be used against 
the DPRK if necessary. It regards Russia's pressure actions and 
the U.S. efforts to impose an embargo as interference in the 
internal affairs of a sovereign state.

    [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 18 and 20 June 
publish the results of public opinion polls conducted by various 
Slovak institutions, surveying interest in participation in the 
forthcoming parliamentary elections and degree of voters' 
support for individual political parties and movements. 
  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 18 June on page 3 carries a 
200-word TA SR report entitled "Would You Participate in the 
Elections If They Were To Be Held Today?" The report notes 
that, in a survey conducted from 1 to 10 June 1994, the Slovak 
Statistical Office asked a representative sample of 1,289 adult 
citizens whether they would participate in the elections "if 
they were to be held today." 
  According to an attached chart, in the survey, 48 percent of 
respondents replied that they would "definitely participate" 
(compared with 52 percent in an analogous Slovak Statistical 
Office survey of May 1994), 29 percent (26 percent in May) said 
that they would "probably participate," 10 percent (9) said that 
they would "probably not participate," 7 percent (6) said that 
they would "definitely not participate," and 6 percent (7) are 
"still undecided." 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 18 June on page 2, under the 
headline "How Would We Vote, Were Elections To Be Held in 
June?," carries a 400-word unattributed report on the same 
Slovak Statistical Office survey (1,289 respondents, data 
collected from 1 to 10 June 1994). The SME report includes the 
following table, which provides the results of respondents' 
replies on their party preferences. In an introductory note, 
SME stresses that the table includes only "the electoral 
decisions of citizens who would definitely or probably 
participate in the early parliamentary elections, if they were 
to be held today." For the sake of comparison, the SME table 
also provides the results of analogous Slovak Statistical Office 
surveys conducted in April and May.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in 
Slovak on 18 June on page 2 carries an 800-word Jergus Ferko 
article entitled "Monument for a Traitor." The article deals 
with the controversy over the unveiling of a plaque for Count 
Janos Esterhazy, an ethnic Hungarian politician who was 
sentenced to death for "high treason" in 1947, organized by the 
local organization of the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement (MKDH) at Senec, western Slovakia. 
  According to the article, the ceremony was to take place on 
19 June at Senec, a town in which ethnic Hungarians make up 27 
percent of the population, and was to be addressed by MKDH 
Deputy Pal Csaky and Esterhazy's daughter Alice. However, the 
preparations triggered protests from the local organization of 
the Slovak Heritage Foundation. According to Ferko, Slovak 
Heritage Foundation members from Senec were pointing out that, 
"by his political activity, Count Esterhazy contributed to the 
occupation of southern Slovakia (including Senec) by Horthy's 
fascist army and to the subsequent seizure of this territory by 
Hungary. After the war, he was proved guilty of antistate 
espionage for Budapest and sentenced for high treason." The 
protests of the local branch of the Slovak Heritage Foundation 
reportedly received backing from the Slovak Heritage Foundation 
leadership, which issued a statement saying that, "after the 
founding of the first Slovak Republic (in 1939), Esterhazy was 
pushing for the concept of renewing Greater Hungary." 
  Before deciding on the matter, the article continues, J. 
Elsik, the mayor of Senec, asked the Bratislava City Court for 
its assessment of the case. In a written statement, the City 
Court reportedly stated that the verdict of 1947 (which was 
subsequently changed to a life sentence; Esterhazy finally died 
in prison in 1957) remains valid and that Count Esterhazy is 
therefore to be considered a "traitor." The article goes on to 
say: "On Thursday, 16 June, a meeting of the Senec City Council 
was convened with only one item on the agenda: to permit or not 
to permit the plaque. After a `complicated debate' (as is stated 
in the minutes of the meeting) and in the presence of Pal Csaky, 
deputy of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, the City 
Council finally decided not to allow the erection of the plaque." 
  In conclusion, Ferko expresses the conviction that "those 
Senec residents of Hungarian nationality who regard Slovakia as 
their homeland--and I suppose this applies to the overwhelming 
majority of them--will receive the decision of the municipal 
deputies with understanding. And they will surely also realize 
that, once again, someone wanted to turn them into extras for 
his dubious political game. Our southern Slovakia really needs 
to refresh its historical memory--in a different direction, 
however: by renewing the destroyed monuments to Czechoslovak 
legionnaires who died while defending this territory against a 
Hungarian invasion in 1919." 
  Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 18 June on page 2, 
in the "Single Question" column, carries a 150-word reply by 
MKDH Deputy Pal Csaky to a SLOVENSKY DENNIK reporter's question 
about the decision of the Senec City Council. Csaky says: "I 
was present at the meeting of the City Council on Thursday. 
Following a stormy discussion, we decided not to unveil the 
plaque, on which the inscription reads: `Let Us Act Together in 
Love and Understanding.' It is not the right time to commemorate 
someone when national passions are running high, especially if 
the whole situation is incompatible with this motto."

<F P=106> [Article by SME--is, so: "Credit Assistance for the Slovak </F>
Republic by the World Bank Is Supposed To Amount to $700 
Million"] 
  [Text] Bratislava (SME--is, so)--The loan from the 
World Bank (WB) to restructure the enterprise and finance sector 
(EFSAL) is dependent upon obtaining a standby loan from the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). These days, the government is 
negotiating with the IMF regarding the standby loan, and the 
preliminary agreement regarding the granting of the loan (letter 
of intent) should be signed by the end of this week. This was 
mentioned yesterday at a short briefing at the time of the 
consultation of economic ministers by B. Schmoegnerova, deputy 
prime minister. 
  The negotiations were participated in also by a mission from 
the World Bank, under the leadership of Vice President M. Bruno, 
which is paying a working visit to Slovakia. As noted by E. 
Zirnansky, press secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the loan 
will be made up of several draws, and its total value will be 
approximately $100-120 million. According to him, the World Bank 
is considering increasing the overall volume of credits for the 
Slovak Republic to approximately $700 million in the next two to 
four years. As noted by Schmoegnerova, sector loans are being 
worked out to help complete housing construction projects within 
the framework of the KBV [Complex Housing Construction], to 
restructure the labor market, and rebuild forestry. P. Koncos, 
minister of agriculture, added that the loan to improve and 
renew the forests is expected to make a contribution toward 
preventing unprocessed logs from being exported from Slovakia 
and should assist in having the maximum amount of timber 
processed in the lumber and furniture industry in Slovakia. The 
loan for completion of complex housing construction (KBV) is 
supposed to be made available by the World Bank to the Slovak 
Republic this year. "Experts from the World Bank and the 
Ministry of Transportation, Communications, and Public Works 
(MDSVP) have already visited 30-34 localities where the use of 
loan funds is being contemplated. This will be a question of 
municipal housing; the conditions for granting the loan are 
technical in nature," the deputy prime minister said in response 
to a question by SME. 
  After a year of using subsidies in a program to reduce the 
consumption of fuels and energy in apartment buildings and 
apartments, the Ministry of Economics is submitting 
modifications for this program to the government. "This year, 
subsidies should continue to be used also for interest-free 
loans for periods of three years. The budget includes 100 
million Slovak korunas [Sk] for projects designed to improve 
heat and insulation characteristics, the regulation of 
heat-generating facilities, the reconstruction of thermal 
resources, the installation of measuring and regulating 
equipment, and the reduction of consumption of electric energy. 
These projects, which could cost as much as Sk3 million, will be 
gathered by the MDSVP and our ministry until the end of July," 
said A. Oparty, state secretary of the Ministry of Economics. 
Conditions for announcing projects will be published by the 
government once they are approved. Another of the points 
discussed by the economic ministers was also the proposal to 
amend the law on consumer taxes. The government will discuss 
this proposal today.

<F P=106> [Article by Stepanka Kucerova: "The Slovak Government Claims </F>
That It Continues To Be Interested in Maintaining the Customs 
Union With the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] The Government of Slovakia considers the 
customs union to be functional and is interested in maintaining 
it. This was stated yesterday at the extraordinary session of 
the Council of the Customs Union (CCU) by Peter Magvasi, Slovak 
economics minister. 
  At yesterday's session, the results of the work of CCU 
expert 
groups resulted in a proposal for an intergovernmental agreement 
regarding the mutual recognition of the output of testing 
facilities and certificates issued by both countries. This 
information was provided by the chairman of the Council of the 
Customs Union, Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister of industry and 
commerce. Experts from another working group yesterday proposed 
the unification of all standards and regulations having to do 
with the responsibility for damage caused by trading a certified 
product and regulations having to do with consumers and 
directives issued by the European Union. Both proposals will be 
subjects of intrastate markup proceedings, and the governments 
of both countries should be approving them by 31 August of this 
year. "I consider the proposal for the treaty to be progress, 
even though it categorizes individual products, certificates for 
which will be issued with various `buts...,'" said Dlouhy. 
  Reservations with regard to the customs union had previously 
already been expressed by B. Schmoegnerova, Slovak economic 
deputy chairperson, according to whom the customs union is 
disadvantageous for Slovakia. She particularly did not agree 
with the current form of payments agreements and with the 
clearing transfer process. On this topic, P. Magvasi said 
yesterday that, in creating this treaty, the possibility for 
some partners to make payments in hard currencies had been 
overlooked. "In the year of experience involving the payments 
agreement, it has turned out that there are a number of 
specifics that require further solution," stated Magvasi. 
Yesterday, two alternatives were presented as supplements to the 
payments agreement. However, as Minister Dlouhy stated, both 
sides failed to agree on which alternative would be selected. In 
the case of so-called sensitive products, both sides yesterday 
agreed that working groups that would be compiling a mechanism 
for identifying listings of such products would not be formed. 
"It is only a short step from this to setting up quotas for 
trade in these products," warned Minister Dlouhy. According to 
him, these problems would be solved on an "ad hoc" basis.

"Statisticians Are Balancing the First Quarter--According to the 
Slovak Republic Statistical Office, a Trend Indicating a 
Slowdown in Price Increases Has Been Evident Since the Beginning 
of the Year"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--During the first three months of this 
year, Slovakia achieved a positive balance of trade amounting to 
2.2 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] in its business transactions 
with the Czech Republic, according to Stefan Condik, chairman of 
the Slovak Republic Statistical Office, at yesterday's press 
conference in Bratislava. During the period under consideration, 
imports from the Czech Republic were valued at Sk14.3 billion, 
which represents 30.2 percent of total imports to Slovakia; on 
the other hand, Slovak Republic exports to the Czech Republic 
were valued at Sk16.5 billion, which corresponds to 37.9 percent 
of total Slovak exports. However, these data do not include 
reexports. Statistics kept by country of commercial transaction 
indicate that the balance of trade between Slovakia and the 
Czech Republic was on the negative side to the extent of Sk3.6 
billion. 
  Stefan Condik noted that, in the first quarter of 1994, a 
trend showing a slowdown of price increases was manifested in 
Slovakia. According to data provided by the Slovak Statistical 
Office, inflation grew by a total of 2.6 percent in comparison 
with December of last year in the first quarter of 1994 and was, 
to a certain extent, influenced by wage developments. Compared 
to February, wages in industry increased by 16.3 percent to 
Sk6,291; wages in the construction industry rose by 15.7 percent 
to Sk5,919; salaries in trade increased by 10 percent to 
Sk4,714; and wages in transportation rose 6.7 percent to 
Sk6,119. Average monthly wages for the entire national economy 
in the first quarter amounted to Sk5,400, which is 14-15 percent 
(Sk700) more than was the case in the same period of last year. 
  In March, Slovakia had 370,500 unemployed, which is about 
14.7 percent of the labor force. Compared with February with an 
unemployment rate of 14.8 percent, the number of unemployed 
declined by 5,500 persons. 
  In March, the effects of introducing the import surcharge 
were felt, and the negative balance of trade increased by only 
Sk35 million. Overall, the balance of trade for the quarter 
ended up with a deficit of Sk3.7 billion. During the first three 
months of the year, Slovakia imported goods valued at Sk47.2 
billion, which is 1 percentage point more than was the case for 
the same period of 1993. Exports amounted to Sk43.5 billion, 
which represents a 2.6-percent decline when compared to last 
year. 
  The value of foreign capital in the Slovak economy by the 
end 
of March was Sk11.5 billion. In comparison with the last quarter 
of 1993, this represents an increase of 6.7 percent. The main 
share in investments in the Slovak economy is still held by 
Austria (23.4 percent) and Germany (21 percent). During the 
latest period, the Czech Republic, whose investment share rose 
to 13 percent, outstripped the United States with a 12.1-percent 
share. Foreign capital is now part of 5,719 corporations. Since 
the beginning of the year, the Slovak Republic has seen the 
failure of 35 firms with foreign property participation, and an 
additional 80 firms are in liquidation.

<F P=106> [Article by Jana Morhacova: "Certificates Have Become the </F>
Objects of Fright for Slovak Importers"] 
  [Text] The requirement by customs officials that products 
be "certified" has become the object of fear for many an 
importer. The Slovak Agricultural and Foodstuffs Inspection 
Service in Bratislava is testing to see whether a product meets 
our standards and issues appropriate certificates. Every day, 
businessmen come to Bratislava to find out if everything is all 
right or whether some additional certificate or certification is 
required. These are not easy to obtain. A Slovak businessman 
must obtain a certificate from the country from which he is 
importing to indicate that the manufacturer is well known to 
state offices there. 
  "To travel to Turkey or Malaysia to chase down a 
manufacturer 
and to convince him that in Slovakia the authorities want to see 
his documentation that indicates that he is authorized to 
produce the product is expensive. If the manufacturer does not 
have such a document, do I have to look for an independent state 
organ in the country in question and ask, say, a Spanish office 
to issue a document for a Spanish manufacturer? And, in the 
final analysis, I will have to find and pay for a translator. 
And what if six of us import items from a single firm to 
Slovakia?" is a question by one of the worried businessmen 
standing in the passageway, who chose, rather, not to order a 
product for four weeks now. 
  "I import material from a distributor who has the exclusive 
rights for all of East Europe. I cannot imagine how I can 
explain to him that he must find some kind of certificate for 
me," says an importer of chocolate products angrily. 
  The quest for documents and certificates does not end when 
the application and all certificates are submitted. Even the 
customs officials have no idea what to check on. If a 
businessman wants to bring a sample across the border for 
testing purposes, he requires a certificate indicating that it 
is a test sample. In importing agricultural raw materials for 
subsequent processing, a document indicating that the product in 
question is an "uncertified" product is required. 
  "We shall have to include the costs of all of the 
`expediting' moves requiring visits to manufacturers and 
official authorities in Italy, Austria, Turkey, or Spain, as 
well as the costs of translations in our prices. Added to these 
will be the cost of traveling from our firm to Bratislava 
several times each week," say several of the businessmen. 
  "And, after all of our peculiarities, I believe that Slovak 
products will be competitive," added a beer importer.

<F P=106> [Article by an unidentified Bratislava correspondent: "The </F>
Share of Private Enterprises in the Total Economic Production of 
the Slovak Republic Is Constantly Growing"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Last year, the private sector accounted 
for more than 20 percent of the total Slovak Republic 
production. The greatest share was accounted for by the 
construction industry, where the overall share of private 
businesses in production amounted to virtually 25 percent. The 
results of the Slovak economy are thus sharply in contrast with 
the results achieved by the Czech Republic last year, where the 
share of private businesses in overall production is running at 
a level of 40 percent. The report by the Slovak Statistical 
Office contained this information. 
  The share of enterprises employing more than 25 workers in 
overall production is virtually 100 percent in certain branches 
of the Slovak economy. This trend is most pronounced in 
industrial production, where the share of enterprises employing 
more than 25 workers is greater than 92 percent. In the 
construction industry, the share amounts to 64.4 percent, in 
trade 21 percent, and in services 45 percent. 
  On the profit side of the balance sheet, the greatest share 
was accounted for by enterprises owned by the state, something 
that was expressly influenced primarily by the energy sector and 
the Transgaz Enterprise. The energy sector, together with the 
transmission of natural gas, accounts for a decisive share in 
the formation of revenues flowing to the Slovak Republic. The 
profit recorded last year by the private sector amounted to 6.2 
percent. Enterprises of the cooperative sector were included in 
the overall evaluation. Results of the public sector were 
largely the result of the highly efficient activities of the 
energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise. 
  As far as evaluating the productivity of labor from the 
standpoint of output, production of goods, basic construction 
activity, and the physical volume of retail sales (excluding the 
energy branch and the Transgaz Enterprise), the highest levels 
were achieved by workers in the so-called other private 
enterprises (foreign as well as international), where the final 
results were valued at 1.187 billion Slovak korunas [Sk]. The 
situation was similar in the case of average monthly wages, 
where the remaining private sector achieved a level of Sk6,521 
and the domestic private sector achieved average monthly wages 
of Sk5,532. Meanwhile, in all privatized enterprises, wages 
amounted to Sk5,420, and in the public sector to Sk5,306. In 
enterprises that were privatized within the framework of the 
first round of coupon privatization, gross wages amounted to 
Sk5,397. 
  As for indicators of profitability, not taking into account 
the results of the energy sector and the Transgaz Enterprise, 
the most efficient results were scored by domestic private 
enterprises. Their share in the profit and outputs amounted to 
1.7 percent, and profitability of costs as a share of profit and 
loss amounted to a value of 1.8 percent. Enterprises privatized 
through coupon privatization were more efficient (1.4 percent) 
than those in the private sector (0.9 percent). 
  Indicators of profitability and wage costs thus indicate 
that 
the activities of private enterprises are more efficient than 
the activities of enterprises in the public sector. 
  The relationship between labor productivity and average 
wages 
in this set of enterprises showed a more favorable trend in 
1993, when compared with the previous period. Given the growth 
in productivity of labor of 35.5 percent, average monthly wages 
increased 19.6 percent. In the domestic private sector, labor 
productivity rose by 6.9 percent (again excluding the energy 
sector), and average monthly wages rose by 18.6 percent. 
  In 1993, wage development did not worsen in comparison with 
1992, and wages expressed in nominal figures did not expressly 
increase inflationary pressures. The development of real values 
was also favorable. With the decline in labor productivity 
recorded in the gross domestic product in constant prices by 0.1 
percent, average monthly wages declined by 3.7 percent. 
  A comparison of profit and loss figures for enterprises 
indicates that the volume of profits increased in agriculture, 
the production and transmission of gas and electric energy, 
ground transportation, and recreational, cultural, and other 
commercial activities. The volume of losses increased in the 
construction industry, the processing industries, and the area 
of real estate. Generally, average monthly wages were higher in 
profitable enterprises, and, on average, wages grew more rapidly 
there. In more branches, however, the growth of average monthly 
wages was higher in unprofitable enterprises than was the case 
in profitable ones.

<F P=106> [Article by Luiza Kowalska: "Defense Issues; KOK Is Holding </F>
a Session Today; Defense Minister and BBN Chief Have Differing 
Views"] 
  [Text] The National Defense Committee [KOK] is to 
make a decision today on what to do about the chief of the 
General Staff: to subordinate him to the president or to the 
defense minister? In the meantime, Henryk Goryszewski, the new 
chief of the presidential National Security Office [BBN], says 
that the president is the boss of the chief of the General Staff 
even now. "That is against the legal system in force," responds 
the defense minister. 
  During a previous KOK session, Lech Walesa did not succeed 
in 
convincing all of its members to make the chief of the General 
Staff subordinated to the president of the country. Debate on 
the topic was postponed until today. 
  KOK's composition includes: the president; the prime 
minister; Sejm and Senate speakers; chiefs of the Foreign 
Affairs Ministry, the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the 
National Defense Ministry [MON]; the finance minister; teh chief 
of the General Staff; the chief of the President's Office; and a 
secretary. Some of the officials (among them, the MON chief and 
the Sejm speaker) want the chief of the General Staff to be 
subordinated to the defense minister. 
  MON will today again present the draft of a law describing 
presidential powers, as well as those of the defense minister 
and the chief of the General Staff. However, the draft does not 
include so-called safety valves that used to provide for 
sanctions in case, for instance, the chief of the General Staff 
were to exceed his powers. During the previous KOK session, it 
was precisely the "safety valves" that aroused many reservations 
on the part of the Belweder. 
  The Small Constitution provides only that "the president, in 
consultation with the defense minister, appoints the chief of 
the General Staff." Details are defined in a statute. There 
has not been any doubt so far that, according to the legal 
system in force, the chief of the General Staff is subordinated 
to the minister. 
  In yesterday's edition of POLSKA ZBROJNA, however, Henryk 
Goryszewski (BBN chief and a KOK secretary for a few days now), 
said that, according to the Constitution, the chief of the 
General Staff is subordinated directly to the president, even 
now. "This does not mean, of course, that the head of the 
General Staff is separated from the minister by a wall; however, 
he is also not subordinated to the president through the head of 
the National Defense Ministry," Goryszewski explained. 
  "That is contrary to the legal system in effect," comments 
MON Chairman Piotr Kolodziejczyk, who also made the reservation 
that he has not yet read Henryk Goryszewski's statement.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Dariusz Szymczycha under the "100 Words" </F>
rubric] 
  [Text] Influence in the municipal self-governments has been 
distributed among the Union of Freedom [UW], Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD], and the right wing. However, none of these 
groupings can afford to wield self-governmental power on their 
own. All of them must hold talks on the formation of a coalition. 
  In democratic states, local policy does not have much to do 
with policies conducted in a given country's capital. In gminas 
[smallest administrative units], even municipal gminas, there is 
more that links people together than there are differences on 
Wiejska Street [location of the Sejm]. 
  I am afraid, however, that typical Polish scenarios may 
emerge. Thus, UW may set up self-governmental coalitions with 
the right wing only because this fits the image of an opposition 
(on Wiejska Street) party. Then municipal authorities may be in 
programmatic opposition to parliament and the government, based 
on the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party and the SLD. It 
will be a political game. The issue of indispensable 
self-governmental reforms will become politicized; UW will lose 
its virtue of freedom because it will become involved in 
compromises and activities pushing it to the right. 
  As can be seen, the selection of partners for municipal 
self-governmental coalitions will contribute to changes in both 
the character and the programs of parliamentary parties.

<F P=106> [Article by Cezary Gmyz: "Fight Over MSZ Continues; Social </F>
Origins Obstacle to Polish Diplomatic Jobs"] 
  [Text] A report issued by a subcommittee evaluating 
personnel in the Foreign Affairs Ministry [MSZ], which was 
obtained by ZYCIE WARSZAWY and a team from the "Pulse of the 
Day" television program, accuses MSZ employees of being of 
aristocratic or Jewish origin. The government failed yesterday 
to adopt a new MSZ statute that would separate politicians from 
clerks. 
  Incompetence, failure to take foreign language tests, 
insufficient work experience in the diplomatic service, foreign 
citizenship, social origins associated with landed aristocracy, 
"Solidarity," Judaism, and having worked for "Radio Free 
Europe"--these were accusations levied by the subcommittee 
evaluating MSZ personnel against employees who accepted 
diplomatic jobs after 1989. 
  The subcommittee's report, which will be presented at a 
session of the Sejm Foreign Affairs Commission today, consists 
of two parts. 
  The first part, which was written by the subcommittee's 
members, speaks of the origins of the subcommittee, lists 
certain criteria that diplomats should meet, and also lists 
accusations concerning MSZ's personnel policies. The authors of 
the report write that cases of employees being released from 
duty after 1989 "bring to the surface the issue of 
constitutional responsibility by the former and current foreign 
affairs minister." 
  Another part of the report, the so-called supplement, 
contains 11 appendixes that, according to the subcommittee's 
members, were written by former and current MSZ employees, as 
well as by people from outside the MSZ. Only two of the 
appendixes, pertaining to several cats that were kept by one 
ambassador in his residence, are signed. 
  The appendixes, which in effect amount to denunciations, 
contain an assessment of the MSZ's personnel policies and of 
foreign policy in general. The arguments that were listed most 
often concern membership in a social group, having been abroad 
before 1989, or being married to a foreigner. One of the 
authors of the treaty with Lithuania is being reminded that his 
father was a Stalinist diplomat, but the fact that the 
individual himself is an outstanding historian and a former 
member of the democratic opposition is not mentioned. Another 
diplomat is said to allegedly be implementing the Vatican's 
plans in the East because he worked for Vatican Radio in the 
past. In one of the appendixes, the dissolution of Comecon and 
the Warsaw Pact is regarded as a misfortune for Poland. 
  Because of suspicion that the appendixes contain slanders, 
Professor Bronislaw Geremek, chief of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, refused to distribute the report's appendix to Sejm 
deputies. "The appendix is an integral part of the 
subcommittee's report," said Tadeusz Samborski, a member of the 
subcommittee. "Professor Geremek's decision is unacceptable." 
  Aside from the coalition members, the document was signed by 
Wojciech Lamentowicz, of the Union of Labor, and Andrzej 
Micewski.

<F P=106> [Unattributed PAP article: "Will Poland Be `Lifted' by Its </F>
Helicopters? Decline in World Demand for Arms"] 
  [Text] "In general, there is a perceptible worldwide 
decline in the demand for weapons, and suppliers seek new 
contractors in order to protect themselves against having to 
make production cuts. Even the markets they have ignored before 
have now become of interest to them," a high-ranking official 
connected with the Polish arms industry told us. 
  According to him, currently pride of place in the world arms 
trade goes to the United States, although Britain has recently 
also increased its sales. Arms purchases have fallen from some 
$50 billion to approximately $20 billion. Whereas previously 
the Russians used to earn half of these amounts, at present 
their share amounts to only about $2 billion. It is hard to 
explain why Poland is being singled out for attack rather than, 
for instance, the Czech Republic, which sells as much as we do. 
Recently that country was visited by General Pinochet, and he 
certainly would not have been discussing purchases with Jablonex 
[costume jewelry manufacturers], especially because he visited 
the Brno military technology fair. 
  Poland used to sell quite a lot of weapons, mainly to the 
Warsaw Pact countries but also to the Middle East, our 
interviewee added. Commenting on the reports broadcast by the 
British television's Channel 4 about the sale of 16 containers 
of machine guns to Iraq, he said that journalists preparing the 
program displayed ignorance. All guns have serial numbers, and 
far too many people would have had to be informed about the 
export of so many containers. Lucznik makes only submachine 
guns, not rifles; the latter are manufactured at Cegielski and 
Tarnow. 
  "Recently an unidentified foreign journalist called us and 
asked whether it was true that we were making new MIG-21's and 
selling them to Yugoslavia. Poland has never produced any 
MIG's, and, as far as MIG-21's are concerned, they are surely 
only wanted, if they are wanted at all, as museum pieces 
nowadays," he said, adding that it was impossible to sell 
weapons to the countries of the former Yugoslavia because of the 
international controls in force. "Only the neighboring 
countries would possibly be able to smuggle something in there," 
he commented. 
  "As far as Iraq is concerned, it is well known that weapons 
filter in there mainly via the Kurds. Poland had sold tanks to 
that country, and, consequently, if we were accused of supplying 
them with spares, that would at least make some sense. Arms 
sales have to make economic sense, and that is the only 
criterion," the official insisted. 
  In his opinion, we should be developing our arms industry. 
  "The Hungarians buy from both East and West. This way they 
cushion themselves against political pressures and exigencies. 
We could easily be making money from our industry, and that is 
precisely what many states are unhappy about, because, for 
instance, out of all of the countries of the former USSR [as 
published], we are the only one that manufactures helicopters," 
he added. 
<H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5>

  -  Polish arms exports have declined by about 85 percent 
since 1988, and orders from the Polish armed forces have 
declined disastrously. 
  -  Since 1965, the Polish arms industry has 
produced 11,000 tanks, 6,800 self-propelled howitzers, 1,600 
artillery tractors, about 9,000 armored personnel carriers, 
6,000 helicopters, and 1.5 million submachine guns, as well as 
munitions. 
  -  Between 1984 and 1991, Poland exported weapons worth 
$1.8 billion and 7 billion transfer rubles. 
  -  Between 1979 and 
1989, exports of tanks earned Polish industry $2.5 billion. 
More than 80 percent of arms were exported to the former USSR.

  [Text] Knin, 22 Jun (TANJUG) -- Members of the Serbian army 
of Krajina returned to positions in the area of the village of 
Kakma near Benkovac, along the Croatian-Krajina separation line, 
an area that has been designated by the Zagreb agreement as 
being within the zone of separation. 
  This was also confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Marinko Gajic, 
deputy commander of the Serbian army of Krajina, who explained 
the move as a measure of precaution against increased Croatian 
threats to the effect that they would forcibly capture the water 
springs in this village. 
  The source supplying Benkovac with water has been controlled 
by the Serbian army of Krajina until recently, but became part 
of the so-called zone of separation in accordance with the 
Zagreb agreement. This area is now under the jurisdiction of 
the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Canadian battalion. 
  Allan Roberts, spokesman for Sector South, told TANJUG's 
correspondent that the situation is being assessed "very 
carefully," and that consultations are being conducted at the 
moment, "so nothing specific can be said."

Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 22 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Hadziahmetovic] In the first part of today's 
session, the deputies of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly adopted 
the report on the work of the state delegation at the Geneva 
negotiations, [words indistinct] with the contact group, and the 
[words indistinct] on the military agreement. 
  The state delegation at the Geneva negotiations [words 
indistinct], Prime Minister Silajdzic said, submitting the 
report on the talks with the international contact group. The 
delegation approached the talks with the demand that the 
principle of the preservation of the sovereignty of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders 
be respected, and that the occupied territories with the 
majority Bosniak and Croatian population be returned [words 
indistinct], the necessity of respecting the principles of the 
London conference, and the UN Security Council resolutions, 
Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding: 
  [Silajdzic] When it comes to concrete, territorial 
solutions, the state delegation presented the contact group with 
a map of the federation as determined by the Vienna agreement, 
at which the territories with the majority Bosniak and Croatian 
population are defined, amounting to 58 percent of the territory 
of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The contact group was 
presented with information and other convincing documentation on 
the justifiability of the solutions that we are committed to. 
  Four, as for the issue of the so-called corridor, the state 
delegation presented a unified view that corridors are 
unnecessary as a lasting solution, since the territory with the 
Bosniak and Croatian majority and the territory with the Serb 
majority are a constituent part of the state of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in which freedom of movement of people and 
goods must be provided and guaranteed in all the regions. 
Therefore, (corridors) are redundant. We presented the view 
that, if the issue of the corridors is to be discussed, then it 
must include a link between the central part of the federation 
and the Bihac canton. All the corridors must have an equal 
status regardless of for whom they are established and through 
whose territories they pass. 
  Five, I particularly want to stress that the state 
delegation 
was very persistent and resolute in its view that the contact 
group could not attempt to open seriously the process of 
negotiations if, at the same time, the issue of measures to be 
undertaken in case of obstructions to the peace process is not 
solved. We asked openly and on several occasions: If the 
negotiations are obstructed, will the international community 
carry out air attacks and other military measures? Will it lift 
the arms embargo? Will it establish an effective control over 
the [Bosnia-Herzegovina] state border with Serbia and 
Montenegro? Will it tighten the economic embargo against the 
so-called Yugoslavia, and will it impose other sanctions against 
the side that is responsible for the failure of the peace 
conference, the peace initiative? We were told that our demands 
and proposals would be considered, and that we would soon hear 
the views of the contact group concerning these matters. 
  [Hadziahmetovic] We have made it clear, Prime Minister 
Silajdzic continued, that we cannot consider as serious any 
proposal by the contact group unless it contains clearly defined 
intentions and guarantees concerning the implementation of the 
peace agreement. The state delegation reiterated the proposal 
for the Bosnian Serbs to join the federation under equal 
conditions, Prime Minister Silajdzic said, adding: 
  [Silajdzic] In case such a proposal is again rejected, we 
presented the basic principles on which the internal 
organization of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be based. The proposal 
is based on the inviolability of the international subjectivity 
and the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We would 
accept the internal transformation into a complex state, in 
which one part would be the federation and the other would be 
with the Serb majority that would have a high degree of autonomy 
and a permanently open possibility to join the federation. The 
central bodies of that state would be organized in a way that 
would express the constituent position of each [word indistinct].

<F P=106> [Report by Adnana Hadziahmetovic] </F>
  [Text] [Hadziahmetovic] Kresimir Zubak, president of the 
[Bosnia-Herzegovina] Federation and member of the delegation at 
the negotiations in Geneva, has presented a report to the 
deputies in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly on the talks on the 
military agreement, that is, on the ending of hostilities in our 
country. Stressing that he was in the unfortunate position of 
having to report on the conclusions of the Geneva talks after a 
period of time had elapsed and after the public had already been 
fully briefed on them, Kresimir Zubak stressed once again that 
our delegation had not agreed to hold direct talks with the 
Serbian aggressor side (?at any time). Talks had been held with 
Akashi and a group of experts. He said that the delegation did 
not want to discuss the draft agreement on the ending of 
hostilities until guarantees had been given that the aggressor's 
soldiers had withdrawn from the 3-km zone around Gorazde. 
  He also stressed that the delegation had not accepted any 
proposals made by the Serbian aggressor side. The content of 
the agreement on the ending of hostilities [words indistinct] to 
stop hostilities for four weeks. [words indistinct] that the 
forces of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbian 
aggressor be separated by UN forces and that the agreement on 
the ending of hostilities be linked to the talks with the 
contact group on a (?partial) and comprehensive peace solution. 
  At the end of his report, Kresimir Zubak said: 
  [Begin Zubak recording] (?In that sense) I do not think that 
there is any reason why this distinguished house should not 
conclude that we, as the victims of aggression, have succeeded 
for the first time in imposing solutions that suit us. In other 
words, our solutions were not only [words indistinct] but were 
principled and directed at a final solution [words indistinct] 
[end recording] 
  [Hadziahmetovic] [words indistinct] The deputies of the 
Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina unanimously and without debate 
adopted the reports on the work of our delegations in Geneva, 
approved of the work of the delegations, and supported all 
efforts aimed at finding a peaceful solution in our country.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 23 June reports an 
increasing number of cease-fire violations on the following 
Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefields: 
  From Brcko correspondent Hamiz Deronjic reports that "the 
defense lines of the free Brcko territory have suffered constant 
heavy enemy fire in the last 24 hours. In the course of the 
previous day as well as last night the entire line of Brcko's 
defense was the target of the Chetnik infantry arms, 
antiaircraft machine guns, and rifles. The enemy started the 
shelling early yesterday evening. The most powerful artillery 
activities were against Boderiste." "There was no peace on the 
central part of the Brcko front either," Deronjic continues, 
reporting attacks from Browning guns, portable launchers, and 
rifles. Deronjic also reports the "regrouping of enemy forces" 
and says that a "high concentration of the aggressor's manpower 
has been spotted in the western part of Brcko's defense. The 
soldiers of the Brcko 108th Motorized and the 108th Infantry 
Brigades are ready to resist any possible attacks of the Serbian 
aggressor." 
  From Gradacac, the Information Service of the (?105th) 
Chivalrous Motorized Brigade says that "the aggressor violated 
the cease-fire considerably on the Gradacac front last night." 
As the service says, from a 120-mm mortar in Gornje Krecane he 
fired (?five) bombs at Gradacac and its suburbs, however, 
"luckily without any major consequences. At the same time the 
entire western defense sector was exposed to sporadic but very 
intense fire from antiaircraft guns, antiaircraft machine guns, 
and all types of infantry arms. The situation calmed down at 
approximately 2200. Our fighters did not respond to the fire." 
As it is reported, "the morning in Gradacac is peaceful." 
  "On the Zavidovici front the Chetnik offensive continues 
with 
unabated intensity," the Press Center of the 3d Corps reports. 
"Following an artillery preparation from all types of mortars 
and tanks and the entire antiaircraft arsenal, infantry attacks 
were attempted in several directions. Major forces attempted a 
breakthrough in the direction of access to Kazici, Donja Blizna, 
Gornja Blizna, and on the line Lokve-Zedni Vrh. The units of 
the 3d Corps have resisted all the attacks," the press center 
reports. "A gross violation of cease-fire was also noted on the 
Teslic-Tesanj front, where Tesanjke, Tesanj, the region of Vrt, 
(?Salamanov) and [word indistinct] Klanje were shelled. The 
intensified movement of buses and trucks in this area heralds 
new Chetnik infantry attacks."

  [Excerpt] Every new road is of strategic interest these 
days, both from the military and from the civilian point of 
view. That is why the members of the Zenica Engineering 
Battalion had cause for pride today, as they officially 
announced that a new road has been marked out, and it will be 
used for bringing in supplies more quickly and safely to our 
defense lines, for taking care of the wounded, and also for 
linking up the existing [word indistinct] between important 
points in Zenica and the neighboring municipalities. 
  Midhat Ibrahimagic, commander of the Engineering Battalion, 
stressed today in front of his soldiers-builders that the 
marking out of this road -- 3,600 meters long, passing through 
inaccessible terrain and under the worst of weather conditions, 
in only 10 days -- was a real achievement. The order from Army 
General Staff has thus been carried out, and the next task on 
surfacing and [words indistinct] until the road is completed 
will most certainly be done within the deadline. [passage 
omitted]

  [Text] Banja Luka, June 22 (TANJUG)--The Moslem offensive 
in the area of Vozuca on the northern Bosnian Mount Ozren has 
been stopped, Bosnian Serb Army sources said Wednesday. They 
added that the Moslem side had suffered major losses. 
  As the Moslem side is using in the attacks ordinary and 
chlorine- charged artillery shells, around 5,000 women, children 
and old people have been evacuated from the Vozuca area, the 
army said in a statement. 
  Denying radio reports by the local Moslem Second Army Corps 
that Serbs are fleeing in disarray, the Serb Army said that more 
than one hundred Moslems had been killed in the fighting around 
Vozuca and that the village and Mt. Ozren were still under their 
control. 
  Violating the Geneva ceasefire agreement, which came into 
effect on June 10, the Moslems continued to attack Serb 
settlements and positions in other fronts in the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina. 
  Serb units hold firmly all their defence positions and 
return 
fire only when their troops come under heavy offensive attacks, 
the Serb Army statement said. 
  A strong Moslem artillery and infantry attack on Serb 
territory in the area of Komar and Mracaj in central Bosnia was 
repulsed on Tuesday. Its objective was to break through Serb 
defence lines towards Kupres in the south-west 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Moslems are violating the ceasefire agreement also in the 
area of Sarajevo, where their snipers open intensive fire on 
Serb parts of the city. 
  Moslem forces also continued to open fire on Serb positions 
and settlements in the area of Bihac and Krupa na Uni (formerly 
Bosanska Krupa) in western Bosnia, and in the areas of Vlasic, 
Olovo and Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) in the central part of 
the republic, as well as in the region of Gorazde in eastern 
Bosnia and the areas of Gradacac, Trebava and Doboj in the north. 
  Doboj and Teslic came under the heaviest attacks when Moslem 
forces opened artillery fire in early morning hours. Five 
civilians, including two children, were wounded in the shelling 
of Doboj, while two persons were wounded in Teslic. Heavy 
damage was caused to both towns. 
  Joint forces of the Bosnian Croats and the regular army of 
neighbouring Croatia continued attacking the area of Orasje in 
northern Bosnia and resumed attacks in the area of Popovo Polje 
in the south-west of Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Petrovac, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- Radio Velkaton of 
Velika Kladusa denied this morning's REUTER report that members 
of the Muslim army's Fifth Corps, loyal to Alija Izetbegovic, 
"deeply penetrated" the territory controlled by Fikret Abdic and 
that Abdic's "days are numbered." 
  The radio said forces of the National Defense of the 
Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia [APZB] are firmly in 
control of all separation lines in the Cazin Krajina. 
  This afternoon members of the Fifth Corps continued their 
ferocious attacks on civilian targets and positions held by APZB 
forces, Radio Velkaton said. 
  According to the same source, heavy fighting is under way in 
the area of Pecigrad and the strategically important point 
Pivka. One member of the APZB army was killed in the fighting, 
while another three were wounded. 
  Radio Velkaton claims that Izetbegovic's artillery units 
pounded the areas of Porcici, Veljkovici, and Liskovac, 
inflicting considerable material damage.

<F P=106> [Article by D. Becirovic: "Dragoslav Avramovic Speaks With </F>
Montenegrin Energy Officials: 19 Million Dinars for Power Plant 
Repairs"] 
  [Text] The governor requested a precise specification 
of costs; national income must double over the coming months; 
demand that petroleum be exempted from all duty. 
  Niksic, 6 Jun--In order to perform essential repairs on 
Montenegrin electric power plants--at Perucica, Pivo, and 
Pljevlja--19 million dinars must be secured in the shortest 
term. The electric power industry does not have the money, and 
if all the deposits in Montenegrin banks were devoted to the 
repairs, the electric power installations would barely be put in 
order. But the demand that prices be increased will not be 
popular with the government. 
  The governor of the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia], Prof. 
Dragoslav Avramovic, listened politely to energy officials and, 
wielding figures, he "slightly lowered" their demands as he 
went. Because the repairs must be made to the installations, 
Avramovic and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Krunoslav 
Vukcevic said that the energy officials should precisely 
calculate the costs and send those figures to the government and 
governor so that this work, which cannot wait, is done solidly 
and on time. 
  The energy officials also mentioned the possibility of 
paying 
off debts by increasing the price of electricity. However, 
Avramovic said that his program looked at the infrastructure as 
a whole, but that it is now obvious that there are major price 
imbalances in this area. Although prices of electric power are 
low (one-third of the world price), the prices of 
telecommunication services and railroad transportation are 
equally above prices in the world, and something must be done in 
that sector. 
  One of the sore spots in Montenegrin economic life is 
petroleum. Energy officials are seeking to secure from the 
national energy pool the quantity of petroleum provided for 
Montenegro, while "Jugopetrol" director Nikola Dragomanovic put 
forward the demand that petroleum derivatives, which we import 
at prices two to five times higher than the price on the world 
market, be exempted from customs duty and that the market for 
petroleum in our country be free. 
  "If we got rid of customs duty, excise taxes, and controls 
over petroleum, what would happen then?" the governor asked. 
  "The supply would probably be better, with lower prices," 
Dragomanovic responded. 
  In response the comment by some of the participants in the 
meeting that food is expensive in our country, more expensive 
than in the world, Avramovic said that those calculations are 
not accurate, which does not mean that food cannot be cheaper. 
  There was also discussion of wages, whereby the governor 
said 
that it is inexplicable that wages have risen enormously for 
some structures in Serbia, even though they are still low 
compared to world levels.

  [Text] The deployment of military trucks, Serb police 
punitive expeditions, and raids and harassments are still being 
carried out in various parts of Kosova. 
  In the Kodra e Trimave Quarter in Prishtina at approximately 
1600 [1400 GMT] yesterday, a convoy of military vehicles from 
Podujeve paraded along the main street of this quarter and then 
headed toward the center of Prishtina. The convoy was made up 
of ambulances and armored military cars. 
  Meanwhile, a police expedition with four [word indistinct], 
two armored cars, seven police cars, two Land Rovers, and one 
excavator entered the Korish village in Prizren and reeked havoc 
among the peasants. This police expedition raided several homes 
and harassed Ajet Mucaj and his mother Elmaze. They also opened 
holes [vrima] in Mucaj's yard under the pretext of searching for 
weapons. 
  The Kosova Information Center reports that raids and 
maltreatments have been reported in Podujeve, Mitrovice, 
Skenderaj, Kline, and Lipjan.

  [Excerpts] The People's Assembly today approved four bills 
and, at the request of the Socialist Party [PS] parliamentary 
group, the deputies questioned Defense Minister Safet Xhulali on 
the recent elections in Zall-Herr. Gezim Qinami, our 
correspondent to the People's Assembly, reports: 
  [Qinami] [passage omitted] The session then posed questions 
to Defense Minister Zhulali that were requested by the PS 
parliamentary group. The question asked was: Besides the 
elections for the commune chairman in Zall-Herr, are there any 
other reasons for the temporary deployment of hundreds of 
soldiers at the Zall- Herr military unit? 
  Taking the floor, Mr. Zhulali said that the movements of 
soldiers in Zall-Herr has nothing to do with the elections; this 
is the first part of the answer. If you want to know why 
soldiers have been deployed there, I can tell you. The 
Zall-Herr unit is a special one. It has a certain staff 
regardless of whether there is a mobilization or demobilization 
of soldiers, and it is always on full alert. I honestly declare 
that, during the elections in Zall-Herr, we did not have a 
single soldier more than the designated staff. 
  Regarding Mr. Zhulali's answer, Deputy Luan Hajdaraga 
rejoined, calling the Zall-Herr elections unlawful. 
  In the name of the parliamentary Commission of Defense, 
Public Order, and ShIK [National Information Service], Mr. Azem 
Hajdari said that the Zall-Herr elections were conducted in 
conformity with the legislation approved by this parliament. 
  After the discussion, the proceedings ended.

  [Text] A Turkish military delegation led by Deputy Defense 
Minister General Toman Erkan arrived in Albania today. General 
Erkan was received by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, who 
welcomed him and wished him a pleasant stay in Albania. 
  Then a meeting was held, in which Minister Zhulali appraised 
the relations and cooperation between the two countries in the 
field of defense and paid tribute to Turkey's contribution to 
the education and training of personnel, as well as its 
assistance in various fields. 
  Mr. Zhulali went on to stress that, in view of its 
modernization and Partnership for Peace, our army requires more 
help and stronger support in the fields of communication, food, 
medicine, the military industry, etc. 
  For his part, after conveying greetings from the Turkish 
defense minister to Zhulali, General Erkan confirmed that Turkey 
would help the Albanian Army in accordance with the bilateral 
agreement. The cooperation and support that we render to the 
Albanian Army, he said, is a question of mutual assistance. 
  Metin Ornekol, the Turkish ambassador to Tirana, attended 
the 
meeting, which took place in a warm atmosphere. 
  In addition to other activities, the Turkish military 
delegation held working meetings with Lieutenant General Ilia 
Vasho, chief of the Army General Staff, Deputy Defense Minister 
Bashkim Shehu, and other top officials to pinpoint possible 
avenues for greater assistance to the Albanian Army.

  [Text] The first day of the visit of Vaclav Havel, 
president of the Czech Republic, to Romania included two rounds 
of talks between the heads of state and a meeting with Prime 
Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, concluding with an official dinner at 
Cotroceni Palace given by Romania's President Ion Iliescu in 
honor of the guests. 
  [Begin Iliescu recording] Esteemed President Vaclav Havel, 
esteemed guests, ladies and gentlemen: I take great pleasure in 
extending on this occasion our warmest welcome to Romania, a 
country in which, regardless of the hardships of history or of 
the current political fashion, friendship with neighbors and 
those to whom we are connected through a past of so many common 
sufferings remains a constantly respected treasure for us. 
  This first official visit to Bucharest in your capacity as 
president of the newly established Czech Republic makes me 
believe that we are sharing the same feelings, Romania and 
Czechia being connected not only through history and their 
special position in the Central and Eastern European region, but 
also through their aspirations for civilization and humanity in 
this uniform and yet so diversified area that is present-day 
Europe. 
  In the person of President Havel, we greet the political and 
cultural personality, who, under such bitter political and 
ideological conditions in which this part of Europe was kept 
prisoner, through the Charter 77 movement, voiced noble 
aspirations and heroically reaffirmed not only the dignity of 
the Czech and Slovak peoples but also of all peoples in Europe. 
In his act, as well as the act of all those who were close to 
him, one could also recognize the ideals of the Romanian people, 
who, as prisoners of an absurd dictatorship, had to pay such a 
heavy price to win freedom. That is why, on behalf of all those 
present here and of our fellow citizens, allow me to pay homage 
to our distinguished guest. 
  Although in completely different fashion, upon the collapse 
of the Iron Curtain, our countries were confronted with similar 
problems emerging from the complex process of transition to a 
democratically structured society based on the market economy. 
Now, after more than four years, we are facing a time of 
political realism and concrete solutions, which are capable of 
giving real support to our hopes. Those comprehensive 
discussions and arguments that took place during our official 
talks, which focused on cooperation between our countries in the 
process of integration in Euro-Atlantic economic and security 
structures, represent positive proof of our intentions. Our 
talks emphasized the strength of the interests that bind us, 
taking into account the common nature of the problems that we 
have to cope with, the complementary nature of our economies, 
and the high potential of international economic and political 
cooperation. 
  Actions aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation between 
Romania and Czechia, just like other regional cooperation 
projects, not only do not conflict with our joint goal of 
European integration -- an idea that some people have tried to 
disseminate -- but, on the contrary, represent a direct 
contribution to the establishment of favorable conditions for 
this integration. Through their cooperation, Romania and 
Czechia are making preparations for this integration. In our 
capacity as politicians and state leaders, we are duty-bound to 
cooperate in this respect. The treaty on relations of 
friendship and cooperation between Romania and the Czech 
Republic, which we shall be signing tomorrow, represents a 
political sign in this respect and creates the appropriate 
judicial framework, based on European democratic principles, for 
the development of solid Romanian-Czech relations. This 
represents a positive and important contribution to the progress 
of bilateral relations as well as to the organization of 
political and economic cooperation in the entire geo-strategic 
area of Central and Eastern Europe. The organic development of 
our relations in various areas, mainly represents a contribution 
to the creation of appropriate conditions for our relations to 
move forward with our partners in the West, from the stage when 
we are merely regarded as people requesting assistance or 
searching for potential markets, to the stage when we become 
real partners in establishing a new democratic, prosperous, and 
peaceful life in Europe. 
  I propose that we drink a toast to this future of our 
continent, a future for which it is not enough for us just to 
wish but also to build together, to the ever increasing 
friendship and cooperation between our countries, to the 
prosperity of the Romanian and Czech peoples, and to the good 
health of all those present. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Speech by Czech President Vaclav Havel at a dinner given in </F>
his honor by Romanian President Ion Iliescu, in Bucharest on 21 
June -- recorded; Havel speaks in Czech with passage-by-passage 
translation into Romanian; translated from the Romanian] 
  [Text] Esteemed Mr. President, esteemed ladies and 
gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to be present here in the 
capital city of Romania, a country that has for our homeland 
such friendly, open, and cordial relations. I wish to thank you 
for the pleasant welcome and warm hospitality extended to me. 
  Mr. President, we have held negotiations that tomorrow will 
be crowned with the signing of the basic treaty between our two 
countries. This treaty is going to bring our relations to where 
I consider that they should be, that is, to the level of states 
that not only demonstrate their natural mutual interests and 
respect for each other, but, first of all, have decided to move 
on to the path of effort and intensive work, which should bring 
them to where their rightful place is, that is, among the 
developed countries of Europe, because our states respect the 
same values and nurture the same ideals. These feelings are 
strongly rooted in the traditions of the European cultural 
space. Talking about this cultural space, I cannot help 
recalling that what inextricably binds Romania, its culture and 
history, to this space is the work of certain creative Romanian 
personalities such as Eugen Ionesco, Tristan Tzara, Mircea 
Elide, Constantin Bancusi, and others. 
  In the 19th and 20th century, first of all it was Prague 
that 
meant the magic city for them, with an irresistible force of 
attraction. Prague was visited by [Mihai] Eminescu, the 
greatest Romanian poet. Constantin Brancusi exhibited his work 
here before World War I. In the twenties Lucian Blaga came 
here, and Nicolae Iorga worked hard for Czech-Romanian relations. 
  Allow me also to recall some more painful elements that are 
preserved in our minds. We recently laid wreaths in (?Klovcie) 
in Moravia at the monument that commemorates Romanian soldiers 
who fell in battles 50 years ago, fighting for the liberation of 
our country. I have realized how close our countries can be. 
Thousands of soldiers lost their lives in our homeland, 
fighting far from their homes to free us from the chains of 
slavery that they themselves had to endure for several years. 
We never want to forget these ties. 
  Mr. President, certainly we are all aware that our 
countries, 
just as in the past, are still connected by a series of 
historical, cultural, and economic relations. Romania and the 
Czech Republic represent an image of history and of ancient 
cultures to which our countries have been host. The traces of 
this common cultural history can be found everywhere in our 
countries. And this is not the only thing that attracts us 
here. Your country is a place with a lot of beauties highly 
valued by all those who have had the chance to become acquainted 
with them and I believe this to be essential. 
  Mr. President, I followed with deep emotion the struggle of 
the Romanians against dictatorship, under whose yoke they were 
suffering. This dictatorship had very special dimensions and 
also special consequences. Unlike our struggle, yours could not 
avoid victims, which seriously marked contemporary Romanian 
history. Similarly, we have been close witnesses of the stormy 
events that followed your revolution, and those events made a 
great impression on us. That is how I got to understand even 
better how difficult it is for a country to move from 
dictatorship to a normal, functional democracy. I understood 
that serious work awaits us, which, in order to be crowned with 
success, cannot tolerate any delay. 
  Mr. President, it is my wish that our countries should be 
side by side with other countries in Europe, which will no 
longer know borders in the traditional sense of the word. There 
will no longer be borders of misunderstanding and other types of 
separation but rather borders of frankness and sincere 
cooperation. Allow me on this occasion to propose a toast for a 
future full of promises of relations between our countries, to 
the increasing intensity of these relations, not determined by 
geographic proximity but rather by the aspirations and joint 
goals toward which we are advancing together. 
  I am also convinced that our current talks and negotiations 
will represent a new small brick among those with which we will 
be building on the certainly very complicated road that leads to 
the achievement of our goals. I propose a toast to your health, 
Mr. President, and the health of all our dear hosts, to the 
health and happy future of Romania's citizens, with whom I am 
confident that we will always be connected in the future through 
lasting and friendly relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu </F>
by Ryszard Malik; place and date not given: "A Need for a True 
Picture"] 
  [Text] [Malik] Mr. Minister, you are one of the first 
representatives of the Romanian Government to have come to 
Poland since the time of the historic changes which took place 
in our country five years ago. Does this represent any change 
in Polish- Romanian relations? 
  [Melescanu] I would not say that it is a change; it is 
rather the continuation of the traditional links of friendship 
and solidarity which have existed between our countries for 
centuries. We share the same fate in the center of Europe; we 
have faced similar problems; we have fought -- often together -- 
for survival, to maintain our national identities, and we have 
ensured peace and security in Europe. Our solidarity remained 
-- even during the fight against the invader; let me, for 
example, recall commendable measures taken by Romania at the 
beginning of World War II, after Poland was invaded. The need 
for cooperation between our two countries today is more than 
obvious. We have the same goals: reform, democracy, integration 
with European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Our cooperation, 
even coordination of efforts, can only be beneficial to us and 
it can only bring us success. At the same time, we can be 
significant forces of stabilization in the center of the 
continent. 
  [Malik] Romania -- this is at least the impression that we 
(here in Poland) received -- lagged a little behind on the road 
of transformations and reforms which were taking place in the 
postcommunist countries. The same can be said about 
international relations. What is the situation now? 
  [Melescanu] First of all I would like to briefly explain the 
reasons why I believe that the delay that you have mentioned has 
an objective aspect; however, it is also a matter of perception. 
  As is known, Romania was governed in the 1980's by one of 
the 
strictest totalitarian regimes. The deeply repressive character 
of the communist regime did not allow progressive movements, 
similar to the Polish "Solidarity," to develop. Therefore, it 
was only possible to overthrow the dictatorship in a mass 
outbreak of social unrest, not through a gradual linear 
transformation. 
  The transformations, which in Romania were taking place at 
an 
accelerated pace, without any division into stages through which 
other post-communist countries had gone, were radical. Their 
incredibly broad range inevitably resulted in social 
dissatisfaction, which was very visible in the first phase of 
the transition period. These social movements were received 
abroad as an expression of social opposition to the ongoing 
transformation process, whereas in reality, they were the result 
of reform -- reform that was bold and indeed difficult. 
  I would also like to add that as a result of the complexity 
of the problems caused directly by our great involvement in the 
reforms, in 1990 and 1991 we forgot that our situation must and 
should be explained so that people abroad would know about our 
achievements and the steps that we were making toward democracy 
and the market economy; I even mean those steps of which the 
effects are only now beginning to be felt. 
  As opposed to many other areas, industrial production for 
instance, in politics facts do not speak for themselves. In 
other words, the image of Romania abroad was incomplete and 
therefore distorted. I will not condemn all those people who 
have contributed to the creation of this not-very-praiseworthy 
picture of Romania in that period, because we ourselves 
relegated the policy of reporting about the purposes of our 
efforts as well as about the positive results achieved on the 
road of transformations. 
  Your question also implies in a subtle way that there has 
been a change in perception. There existed a need to define the 
true picture of Romania, to correct subjective interpretations, 
and this is exactly what is happening. It is apparent not only 
to the Romanian minister of foreign affairs, but also -- I am 
convinced -- to the public at large. 
  The evaluations of certain international establishments 
today, such as that of the World Bank for instance, confirm the 
considerable progress that has been achieved in Romania on the 
road toward reform. I do not want to quote any statistical 
data. It is undeniable, however, that in 1994, considered to be 
the year of mass privatization, Romania already registered a 
drop in inflation along with perceptible trends in stimulating 
the national economy. 
  It is important to stress that the geostrategic position of 
Romania, its prospects, natural resources, and potential have 
all given it an important and responsible place in the world's 
political life. I am thinking, of course, about our striving 
toward Europe, which we are sharing with Poland and which has 
been confirmed by many documents of the European Union [EU]; 
however, I am also thinking about the vicinity of the 
conflict-stricken territory of former Yugoslavia. The 
priorities of foreign policy place Romania in the European zone, 
but they certainly do not in any way confine its activities to 
only this. 
  [Malik] The Romanians boast of their heritage, which can 
be traced back to Latin civilization. Some Poles associate 
Romania with the sight of Romanian Gypsies begging on the 
streets of Polish towns and cities. How do you, as head of the 
diplomatic service, see the place of your country in Europe and 
the world? 
  [Melescanu] Yes, that is true, the entire nation is proud of 
its origin and of its history. Let me repeat well-known facts: 
the Romanians are proud to stress their Latin origin, the fact 
that, despite various developments, they have retained their 
identity on the land of their fathers. Our nation has survived 
as a real island of Latin culture right in the middle of a 
Slavic sea. You have mentioned Poles, who associate the image 
of Romania with Romanian Gypsies. I am certain, however, that 
even more Poles know our country better -- I am now thinking 
about those of them who have had some contacts with our culture, 
about hundreds of thousands of your countrymen who have visited 
our country. Their picture of Romania should not be that much 
deformed. 
  Current economic difficulties are bound to be overcome and 
Romania will be able to quickly regain the prestige and the 
place that it deserves, thanks to its European vocation. 
  [Malik] Bucharest has been very active on the political 
scene lately. Can you specify when Romania will become an equal 
member of the EU or West European Union [WEU]? 
  [Melescanu] I am convinced that my words will be interpreted 
correctly if I say that the Romanian diplomatic service is 
evaluated as active, constructive, and realistic. Bucharest is 
increasingly mentioned as a center that organizes international 
meetings; increasingly more is also being said about the 
presence of the Romanian diplomatic service in the regional 
arena -- both in Europe and around the world. These aspects are 
not at all new; they have simply become more visible recently 
because they have ceased to be obscured by prejudices and by the 
not-really-true picture of Romania. Again, what should be done 
is to recognize the existing state of affairs rather than 
organizing a diplomatic offensive. 
  Aside from that, as you know, integration with the European 
and Euro-Atlantic structures is one of the priorities of 
Romania's foreign and security policy. The recently observed 
development of the situation in this area has confirmed that 
this integration is not merely a theoretical striving or a 
remote goal. 
  If, on the one hand, one takes into account recent 
initiatives aimed at preparing our states to become an 
inalienable, stronger, and more stable part of the extended 
Europe -- the "Partnership for Peace," association with WEU, the 
Hurd-Andreatta initiative, the Pact on Stability, and on the 
other hand, the progress that Romania has made on the road of 
reforms, then I believe that this provides foundations to give 
an optimistic answer. 
  We can believe, therefore, that integration with the EU 
might 
be put into effect toward the end of this century and that this 
will be accompanied -- quite logically -- by simultaneous 
integration with the WEU. These predictions, justified by our 
research, should not be interpreted as an attempt to 
underestimate the various problems that still exist. 
  I am convinced that the title of full EU member will be the 
confirmation of the state of affairs. This statement is 
entirely justified by the fact that the EU is going through a 
process of creating, along with us -- the associate-member 
states -- their foreign policy and a policy of joint security, 
which will go considerably beyond the borders of the EU, before 
our de facto integration takes place. In my opinion, this is 
what is going to determine the continuation of European 
integration. This will also make it easier for our countries to 
come closer together. This is one more argument that supports 
my evaluation. 
  [Malik] Not far from Romania, the tragedy of the former 
Yugoslavia is going on. What is the position of Bucharest on 
the conflict between Serbia and Croatia, not to mention Bosnia? 
  [Melescanu] First of all, I do not think that this is a 
conflict between Serbia and Croatia or Bosnia. Of course, the 
problem of Kraiina remains unresolved; however, the present 
situation does not pose the risk of direct armed conflict. As 
far as Bosnia is concerned, ethnic communities are fighting 
there in direct confrontation of civil war. 
  Romania has all along been in favor of resolving this 
conflict by political means, of providing a resolution that 
would be acceptable to all parties; the first step should be to 
stop the bloodshed. This is the only way to ensure lasting peace 
in the region. For this very reason we are happy about the 
recent, albeit temporary cease-fire. It is very important for 
the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia to arrive at a 
joint position on the Bosnian issue. Thus, I am an optimist and 
I believe that thanks to joint efforts by international 
communities, we will soon be able restore peace there.

  [Text] Today at Cotroceni Palace, Romanian President Ion 
Iliescu received the representatives of the parliamentary 
delegation of the Republic of Moldova currently in Bucharest to 
attend the session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black 
Sea Economic Cooperation Zone countries. 
  The delegation is headed by Mr. Petru Lucinschi, the speaker 
of the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova, who, following the 
meeting with President Iliescu, made the following exclusive 
statement to our reporters: 
  [Begin Lucinschi recording] First I would like to say that 
in my assessment we both confirmed that the relations between 
our countries are quite intense [relatii destul de intense], and 
they are developing in every way, although we cannot say that we 
are satisfied, we wish for more, we think that the efficiency of 
our relations could be even higher and better. But, currently, 
both our countries are in transition, in a crisis situation. 
  Our talks concentrated on the concrete aspects of the 
relations between our countries. Thus, we discussed economic 
issues. For instance, the fact that the current emotional state 
and the spiritual problems -- the consequences of which may be 
seen in the spiritual life -- also appear in the press and in 
public opinion. However, little is being done to support the 
furthering of relations among persons, localities, and 
industrial or economic enterprises, by which one could solve the 
majority of the problems currently facing our peoples. 
  Today we have to be realistic -- and this term was recurrent 
during our talks -- because if we disregard the real situation 
we will again end up beating the air, causing either confusion 
or revolt among the people. Thus, the current real situation 
makes it necessary for us to back all those who wish to 
undertake concrete things to better our relations at all levels. 
  This was, in my opinion, the leitmotif of our talks today, 
and we agreed to accomplish some of the things we had previously 
convened. 
  As far as state relations are concerned, indeed, sometimes 
we 
have neglected them, we had an electoral campaign, and you may 
have also been busy with other things, so there are such 
intervals that are not very intense, which is normal. However, 
as far as relations among persons are concerned, they are 
relations as among relatives, which is also normal. Besides all 
this, we have the relations between the businessmen, and here we 
have to establish a better social-economic framework for our 
future cooperation. [end recording]

  [Text] We have just received a message faxed to us by the 
Shipyard Workers' Trade Union Federation -- FESINAR Constanta, 
announcing that the strike over an unlimited period of time, 
which began yesterday at the Constanta Shipyard, was terminated 
today at 1030 [0730 GMT] after agreement was reached on the last 
point on the list of demands of the shipyard workers' trade 
union. 
  The collective labor conflict, which began on 1 June, will 
be 
considered as concluded only after the things agreed upon by the 
trade union and the employer take concrete shape according to 
the time schedule established during the negotiations. 
  A copy of the agreement, which was also faxed to us, 
stipulates, among other things, a 35-percent increase in 
salaries beginning with the month of June, calculated on the 
basis of the 1994 May salaries, as well as a 75-percent increase 
of the salaries beginning with the month of July, calculated on 
the basis of the 1994 May salaries. The aforementioned 
percentage also including the various indexations granted by the 
government over the third term of the year. 
  Beginning today, a social moratorium [moratoriu social] is 
introduced over the next three months, during which the two 
parties are to refrain from initiating new labor conflicts.

<F P=106> ["Sz.P."-attributed report: "The Expected Members of the </F>
Horn Government"] 
  [Text] According to our information received from leading 
Socialist circles, it has not yet been decided who will fill 
certain state secretarial positions where the Hungarian 
Socialist Party [MSZP] is to provide the minister, and even the 
names of some ministers are not yet known. As has come to 
light, according to the conditional agreement, out of the future 
government's 12 ministries, three will be headed by the Alliance 
of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. It can be taken as certain that Gabor 
Kuncze will be the interior minister and Ferenc Wekler will 
probably be his state secretary. Karoly Lotz, who was a deputy 
for the SZDSZ in the previous Parliament, too, is expected to 
head the Transport Ministry. It can be taken as certain that 
Gabor Fodor is to head the Ministry for Culture [and Education], 
and probably MSZP Deputy Chairman Gyorgy Janosi will be his 
Socialist political state secretary. Laszlo Kovacs, chairman of 
the former Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, will head the 
Foreign Ministry in the next cycle. The political state 
secretary in the Foreign Ministry will also be a Socialist. The 
name of Ferenc Somogyi, a former administrative state secretary, 
was raised but, according to our informant, his nomination is 
not yet clarified. Laszlo Bekesi will head the Finance 
Ministry. Laszlo Pal is the likely industry minister and, 
according to our information, Tatabanya deputy Gabor Szalay will 
be the Free Democrat political state secretary. The former Expo 
commissioner Etele Barath is expected to head the Environmental 
Ministry and the MSZP will also provide the political state 
secretary, parliamentary group expert Katalin Szili is a 
possible candidate. The Socialist Laszlo Lakos is certain to 
head the Agricultural Ministry. The SZDSZ will provide the 
political state secretary, possibly Zoltan Kiss. Mrs Kosa, 
Magda Kovacs will probably be the labor minister, and MSZP 
executive member Sandor Csintalan could be her state secretary 
but, according to our information, he has so far refused the 
nomination. The renamed Health and Welfare Ministry 
[Egeszsegugyi es Szocialis] will be headed by Pal Kovacs. MSZP 
executive member Mihaly Kokeny could be his state secretary. 
The situation at the Justice and Defense Ministries is somewhat 
unclear. According to some of our sources, Kalman Kulcsar is 
still a serious candidate for the Justice Ministry, and in this 
case, Pal Vastagh could head the Defense Ministry. Bela Katona 
could also get a position in the Defense Ministry's leadership. 
According to our information, the MSZP has not yet found a 
nominee for the position of minister without portfolio 
supervising the secret services; the fate of this position is 
unclear at the moment. 
  We have also acquired information regarding the chairmen of 
parliamentary committees. The Constitutional Committee would be 
headed by Peter Hack of the SZDSZ, the Defense Committee by Imre 
Mecs (SZDSZ), and the Foreign Affairs Committee by Istvan Szent- 
Ivanyi, also of the SZDSZ. Of the committees headed by the 
Socialists, Judit Csehak will probably be the chairwoman of the 
Welfare Committee, Csaba Tabajdi the chairman of the Human 
Rights Committee, Sandor Orosz of the Agricultural Committee, 
and Ivan Vitanyi of the Cultural Committee.

<F P=106> [Article by "r": "Whom Did Citizens of the Slovak Republic </F>
Trust at the Beginning of June 1994?] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The group of citizens who do not trust 
any figure on our political scene has grown again--from 25 
percent in April to 42 percent at the beginning of June. The 
first three places in the ranking of trustworthiness have been 
occupied throughout this period by the same 
politicians--Vladimir Meciar, Michal Kovac, and Jozef Moravcik. 
This transpires from a public opinion survey conducted by the 
Slovak Statistical Office at the beginning of June. 
  The survey ascertained considerable differences in the level 
of confidence in political personalities between the residents 
of Bratislava and the residents of other regions in Slovakia, 
especially regarding the top places in the ranking. At the 
beginning of June, 31 percent of Bratislava residents did not 
trust any politician, which is 11 percent below the all-Slovak 
average. 
  (The table below includes only the names of politicians who 
were trusted by more than 2 percent of respondents in June. 
Each respondent could name, at his own discretion, up to three 
figures, which is why the sum total exceeds 100.)

includes the following passage on the structure of supporters of

  [Text] Warsaw, 22 Jun--Poland welcomes with satisfaction 
the fact that Russia, as the 21st state, has joined the 
Partnership for Peace program under the conditions defined in 
its framework document, says a Foreign Affairs Ministry 
statement conveyed to PAP on 22 June. 
  The statement says: This is an important step along the road 
toward strengthening the stability of our continent, compatible 
with the philosophy of the program. It is suited to new 
European conditions and the new tasks of the Atlantic Alliance. 
  Poland, which joined the Partnership for Peace on 2 February 
and submitted its presentation document on 25 April of this year 
and is now close to coordinating an individual partnership 
program with NATO, hopes that Russia's participation in the 
program will also promote partnerlike Polish-Russian cooperation. 
  We invariably believe that good cooperation between NATO and 
Russia, pursued with respect for the interests of all partner 
states, irrespective of their size and military potential, is of 
fundamental significance for security and stability in Europe. 
Poland is convinced that this cooperation should be accompanied 
by a gradual expansion of the Alliance to interested states that 
share its objectives and values. This would promote the 
implementation of Alliance tasks and the stabilization of the 
European situation, the Foreign Ministry statement says.

<F P=106> ["F.B." interview with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic; </F>
place and date not given: "But for Us War Continues"] 
  [Text] [L'ESPRESSO] Mr. President, can we talk in terms of 
normality in Sarajevo now? 
  [Izetbegovic] Definitely not. It will take a long time yet 
before we can talk in terms of a normalization. I do not yet see 
any solution to the problems of the city and of Bosnia. And I am 
afraid that the issues concerning Sarajevo will be resolved 
last. Let us not forget that it is still a city under siege. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] You do not seem to have much confidence in the 
negotiations. 
  [Izetbegovic] I am sure that the negotiations, like those in 
Geneva, are useful. But it is a zigzag process. Ultimately we 
will reach a solution. Of the only two possible solutions -- 
peace or war -- only one is feasible. But I do not believe in 
the short term, because the negotiations are very unpleasant. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Let us return to Sarajevo. There is a great 
deal of unrest. First, the problem was survival. Now, it is 
how to make a living: There is no work... 
  [Izetbegovic] Yes, work is the main problem. We are in the 
position of someone who is seriously ill; as long as he is ill, 
he has only one problem -- how to recover. But once he has 
recovered, he realizes that he has innumerable probes. Now, for 
instance, the markets are full of goods, but there is not yet 
the money needed to buy them. The situation will return to 
normal only when production has been set back in motion. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] But why is an attempt not made to make this 
process quicker? 
  [Izetbegovic] It is impossible. The most complex problem 
facing the world now is in fact Bosnia. And the most 
complicated problem in Bosnia is Sarajevo. Nobody now knows the 
solution. Look at the map. We are here. Around us there are 
the Serbs. And we in turn surround the Serbs who surround 
Sarajevo. Everyone is surrounded. So how is it possible to 
predict how it will end? There has been talk about a 
protectorate of Bosnia on the part of the world community: I 
leave people to talk. But any solution that Europe were to 
choose would be a non-solution. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] You say that the embargo on Bosnia should be 
lifted. Will you succeed in this? 
  [Izetbegovic] No, I do not think it is possible. But we have 
a duty to demand it. We could achieve another result -- that of 
depriving the Serbs of their heavy weapons. Let us remember 
that peace will only be possible if there is a balance of 
forces. This war, like all wars, is the result of an imbalance 
of armaments. In any case, the international community's 
response is significant -- when it says that more weapons means 
more bloodshed. So it should work to take the weapons -- heavy 
weapons, at least -- away from those who have them. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Are you not aware that people are very tired of 
this war? Even the soldiers of the Muslim army? 
  [Izetbegovic] I think that this tiredness exists mainly on 
the Serbian side. We want peace, but we can continue the war. 
There is no tiredness among our soldiers, because our morale is 
different from theirs. We are the victims, and soldiers 
defending their own land always have a higher level of morale 
than the aggressors. The Serbs had 100 times more equipment and 
weapons than us. And still they failed to enter even Mostar or 
Tuzla. 
  [L'ESPRESSO] Let me ask you to assign some grades. Which 
countries do you consider Bosnia's best friends? And who is at 
the bottom of the list? 
  [Izetbegovic] The Muslim countries are in first place, then 
Germany, Italy, Belgium. At the bottom? France and Britain.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Vladimir Jovanovic: "Dedinje on the Romanija </F>
Mount"] 
  [Text] Serbs are more and more divided on the question of 
the future and development of the war crisis in Bosnia. Zoran 
Lilic's words uttered the day after the session of the Supreme 
Defense Council of the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] are 
a clear signal to the Serbian war lobby across the Drina. Lilic 
said that they cannot "hold hostage" the population on this side 
of the Drina. 
  These words have attracted the attention of observers in 
Belgrade. They were said amidst the debate about [Zoran] 
Djindjic's initiative and the increased pressure Belgrade is 
exerting on Radovan Karadzic and others to accept the proposed 
division of Bosnia. 
<H5>  The Malcontents </H5>
  Our sources claim that nothing happens by chance. Their 
interpretation of Djindjic's initiative points out his 
ever-increasing and ever more important links with Karadzic, 
and, on the other hand, with Cosic and the church. These people 
are inclined toward the unitarization of the FRY and toward 
creating, effectively and legally, a Serbian national state. 
Milosevic and his leftist national wing are allegedly more 
inclined toward a "civic state." MONITOR's sources further claim 
that Bulatovic's "Herzegovina initiative" represented a simpler 
test. Trebinje Leader Bozidar Vucurovic said that he is not 
interested in such a project, as his interest is not in a civic, 
but a national state. 
  Three weeks ago, Milosevic received a delegation of the SPS 
[Socialist Party of Serbia] from Bosnia. On that occasion, he 
told them that he wants them to secure power in the Srpska 
republic, that he will help them do so (not publicly and 
directly, of course), and that Banja Luka will be the new 
capital of the Srpska republic. After this, the SPS of the 
Srpska republic held a convention in Banja Luka, traditionally a 
stronghold of the opposition against Karadzic (rebellion of a 
unit last September, disagreement between the 1st Krajina Corps 
Commander General Talic and the central command, and the like). 
On the other hand, Karadzic is granted less and less time on 
the state television and nobody in Belgrade wants to talk 
officially about his political future, although he is being 
asked to do the impossible -- convince his top military 
leadership and followers to give over 20 percent of territories 
presently under their control to the Bosnian Government without 
any guarantees that such a division of Bosnia will be 
long-lasting. 
  Karadzic is not standing still: He is trying to activate his 
intelligence-police network Tajfun [hurricane] in Belgrade. 
Many people claim that the role played in all this by Momcilo 
Mandic, former deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who is now head of the Bureau of the 
Srpska republic in Belgrade, is also unclear. Moreover, 
Karadzic has been closely gathering around himself the 
anticommunist nucleus (the Plavsic woman, Krajisnik, and 
others); he has also received secret support by the church at 
the recent meeting of its top leadership held at the Pec 
Patriarchate. 
  Belgrade, however, assesses affairs within the Serbian 
leadership in Bosnia to be "numerous as the sands" and that will 
be used as a trump card by the socialists in their election 
campaign. What is this scenario like? 
  Milosevic is counting, or at least was counting, on a 
longer-lasting truce in Bosnia, which would enable elections to 
be held there. With the support of the police and television -- 
somewhat in the fashion in which this was done in Krajina in the 
case of [Milan] Martic -- Milosevic's candidates would win at 
these elections. Karadzic will become an old story. Along with 
General Mladic. 
  Expectations of this kind are still uncertain: The 
development of the crisis in Bosnia does not promise a permanent 
peace. This suits Karadzic as destabilization is out of 
question at the time of possibly decisive battles. 
  A dispute of a fundamental nature has broken out among the 
Serbs. Heated debates are being held about questions connected 
with the future and whether it is of any use to continue to wage 
war. On the other hand, a tough struggle for power has begun 
between the Serbs across the Drina and Belgrade and it is 
difficult to predict the final outcome of this clash. 
  Milosevic is trying to rally his war advisers and aides. 
Radmilo Bogdanovic, however, has said: "I am not pleased by 
Lilic's statement" -- something that may develop into a tough 
conflict. 
  MONITOR's sources claim that the opinion prevails among the 
top Serbian leadership in Bosnia that the war will inevitably 
continue. These assessments are probably justified from the 
point of view of General Mladic, for instance: He surely 
possesses correct reports regarding the intentions of Bosnian 
and Croatian generals to carry out a breakthrough in northern 
and western Bosnia. This is clear. Belgrade, however, is 
prepared to trade with territories, but that is not feasible in 
practice. 
<H5>  Discontentment </H5>
  General Mladic is trying to reorganize his forces. His 
intention is to form larger mobile tactical units that would be 
able to be transferred from one front to another whenever there 
is need to do so. He is also trying to get rid of some officers 
he considers to be unsuitable. 
  At the same time, Milosevic is criticizing the General Staff 
of the Yugoslav Army, that is, General Perisic, because of its 
support to the top Serbian leadership in Bosnia. By carrying 
out certain cadre changes in the army, he is trying to place 
under his control this factor that is potentially extremely 
tricky for him. 
  Discontented with the general situation in the Army, he 
criticizes General Perisic and others partly for crime in the 
Yugoslav Army, unsolved murders (see box), and for Yugoslav Army 
officers "unselectively" departing for Krajina and Bosnia. 
  Through his "exclusive channels," Milosevic is trying to 
feel 
the situation in the top leadership of the army of the Srpska 
republic as well. It seems that he has some serious intentions 
regarding General Manojlo Milovanovic, currently head of the 
headquarters of the army of the Srpska republic. This tanker who 
graduated from high military schools has recently led all 
large-scale offensive operations of the Srpska army. His 
position prior to the current one was commander of the Drina 
Corps of the army of the Srpska republic. An analysis of his 
statements, particularly concerning crises around Sarajevo and 
Gorazde this year shows that he often corrects and moderates 
General Mladic's statements. Satisfied with the mop-up 
operations carried out in the belt along the Drina last spring, 
Milosevic has personally appointed him to the post of head of 
operations of the army of the Srpska republic. 
  In the meantime, a major piece of "ill luck" befell Mladic. 
At the end of May, Bosnians took Elevation 691 on the Ozren 
Mount, southwest of Tuzla, that is, the well-known Serbian 
stronghold of "Vijenac." Even VECERNJE NOVOSTI admitted that 
and reported on the Serbian loss of about 110 fighters. The 
article held as responsible the commander of the Serbian "Ozren" 
tactical group and the commander of the battalion that was 
defending the said stronghold. 
  The further development of the war crisis might bring more 
"ill luck" to Mladic and thereby mar his "fame." People in the 
know claim that he has already been offered the post of 
commander of the Uzice Corps of the Yugoslav Army, but these 
rumors are impossible to check. 
  Milosevic, Karadzic, Mladic, Cosic -- again! Serbs, it is 
said, must "concede" territories in Bosnia. Does this not 
resemble the haggling over the Vance-Owen plan? Djindjic has 
now fallen into this maelstrom and he is too close to the 
Belgrade regime to be able to easily shake off his links across 
the Drina. After all, he did not establish those links without 
the Serbian president's knowledge. 
  As a part of Djindjic's initiative, somebody has been trying 
to mix up Montenegro into all that. In its announcement 
criticizing the honorable Serbian Democrat, a party says: "You 
have stuck a dangerous thorn into our people's healthy flesh. 
That has motivated separatist forces in Cetinje. The sentiment 
of separating Montenegro from Serbia has been growing," the 
warning says alarmingly. 
  Belgrade sees "Yugoslavia" as a burden. Nobody knows what to 
do with it. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Generals, Death of a Soldier, Crime, Milosevic </H5>
  As the song by singer Kemal Monteno goes, "it was some time 
in spring," when affairs -- of the kind that usually end with en 
masse pensioning off -- begun sprouting. Milosevic is now 
criticizing the General Staff mainly because of some cases of 
crime, but also unexplained circumstances about the death of 
soldier Jugoslav Mihajlovic (19) from Pozarevac. Mihajlovic was 
seriously injured in the Surdulica Barracks on 14 May at about 
2340 and later died in a Nis hospital. The Information Service 
of the General Staff harshly reacted to a report on this case 
carried by a Belgrade daily. However, assertions in the article 
have not been denied. 
  On the other hand, crime in the Yugoslav Army has spread so 
much that General Perisic himself had to deny its existence, 
speaking before about 100 journalists last week. There is no 
smoke without fire, people say. 
  Milosevic, however, uses criticism with a view to exerting 
additional pressure on the top military leadership, something 
that is confirmed by at least two things: 
  a. The situation in the Yugoslav Army is so rotten that even 
the commander himself has to talk about it, at least by denying 
it, and the problem is made much worse by the fact that what is 
mostly talked about is crime. 
  b. Tension is growing between Milosevic and the generals. 
  Again?

<F P=106> [Statement by Ion Iliescu, president of Romania, at a news </F>
conference jointly held with Vaclav Havel, president of the 
Czech Republic, at Bucharest Cotroceni Palace -- live] 
  [Text] I would like to begin by emphasizing the political 
significance of this first visit of the president of the new 
state, the Czech Republic. 
  I believe that above all, this visit marks the evolution of 
the relations between our states by crowning the constant 
evolution of our exchanges, relations, and contacts in the 
political and economic fields, thus, the consolidation and 
furthering of our bilateral relations, as well as our 
cooperation on the international plane within various 
international bodies. 
  Second, this visit outlined the political will of the two 
states to give a new impetus to the furthering of the 
traditional relations existing between our countries and to our 
mutual interest to diversify and further those relations on all 
planes. This will is also expressed by the political document, 
which we signed today, the Friendship and Cooperation Treaty 
between Romania and the Czech Republic. 
  There is no need for me to detail the traditional, old, 
abundant, and eminently positive character of the relations 
between Romania and Czechoslovakia, or the ample history of our 
friendship relations, our feelings of sympathy and solidarity, 
which marked the relations between our peoples. There have 
never been and there are no elements, whatsoever, that could 
cause discord or disagreement between our countries. On the 
contrary, during the difficult, hard moments in the history of 
our nations, the two peoples were always side by side. During 
our talks we also evoked the time of 1968, the unanimous way in 
which Romania's people expressed its solidarity with the 
Czechoslovak people during the Soviet invasion and that of the 
troops of the Warsaw Pact. 
  Thus, both during our talks and in the treaty we signed, we 
registered our will to strengthen those traditional relations 
and to elevate them to a new level within the context of the 
transformations both our countries are currently undergoing. 
  Together we evoked the international problems currently 
facing our countries. We assessed as positive the cooperation 
of our countries within various international bodies, our joint 
actions and our mutual support and interest to further the 
processes of general European integration, and our common will 
to continue to act jointly to promote the general-European 
integration processes on the political plane, to ensure equal 
security conditions to all European states, and to achieve 
economic integration. 
  I believe that President Havel's visit, although short, 
offered him the opportunity -- as this is his first visit to 
Romania -- to personally discover, in the talks he held with 
political and cultural figures, regardless of political 
orientation, the durable feelings of friendship and solidarity 
of the Romanians, of the Romanian people, for the Czech people. 
  It is my conviction that this visit marks an important 
political moment in the history of Romanian-Czech bilateral 
relations.

  [Excerpts] The People's Assembly today approved four bills 
and, at the request of the Socialist Party [PS] parliamentary 
group, the deputies questioned Defense Minister Safet Xhulali on 
the recent elections in Zall-Herr. Gezim Qinami, our 
correspondent to the People's Assembly, reports: 
  [Qinami] [passage omitted] The session then posed questions 
to Defense Minister Zhulali that were requested by the PS 
parliamentary group. The question asked was: Besides the 
elections for the commune chairman in Zall-Herr, are there any 
other reasons for the temporary deployment of hundreds of 
soldiers at the Zall- Herr military unit? 
  Taking the floor, Mr. Zhulali said that the movements of 
soldiers in Zall-Herr has nothing to do with the elections; this 
is the first part of the answer. If you want to know why 
soldiers have been deployed there, I can tell you. The 
Zall-Herr unit is a special one. It has a certain staff 
regardless of whether there is a mobilization or demobilization 
of soldiers, and it is always on full alert. I honestly declare 
that, during the elections in Zall-Herr, we did not have a 
single soldier more than the designated staff. 
  Regarding Mr. Zhulali's answer, Deputy Luan Hajdaraga 
rejoined, calling the Zall-Herr elections unlawful. 
  In the name of the parliamentary Commission of Defense, 
Public Order, and ShIK [National Information Service], Mr. Azem 
Hajdari said that the Zall-Herr elections were conducted in 
conformity with the legislation approved by this parliament. 
  After the discussion, the proceedings ended.

  [Text] A Turkish military delegation led by Deputy Defense 
Minister General Toman Erkan arrived in Albania today. General 
Erkan was received by Defense Minister Safet Zhulali, who 
welcomed him and wished him a pleasant stay in Albania. 
  Then a meeting was held, in which Minister Zhulali appraised 
the relations and cooperation between the two countries in the 
field of defense and paid tribute to Turkey's contribution to 
the education and training of personnel, as well as its 
assistance in various fields. 
  Mr. Zhulali went on to stress that, in view of its 
modernization and Partnership for Peace, our army requires more 
help and stronger support in the fields of communication, food, 
medicine, the military industry, etc. 
  For his part, after conveying greetings from the Turkish 
defense minister to Zhulali, General Erkan confirmed that Turkey 
would help the Albanian Army in accordance with the bilateral 
agreement. The cooperation and support that we render to the 
Albanian Army, he said, is a question of mutual assistance. 
  Metin Ornekol, the Turkish ambassador to Tirana, attended 
the 
meeting, which took place in a warm atmosphere. 
  In addition to other activities, the Turkish military 
delegation held working meetings with Lieutenant General Ilia 
Vasho, chief of the Army General Staff, Deputy Defense Minister 
Bashkim Shehu, and other top officials to pinpoint possible 
avenues for greater assistance to the Albanian Army.

of the State Duma (Parliament) of the Russian Federation, 
Valentin Kovalev, told a press conference held at the Romanian 
Parliament building that an improvement of the customs

  Besides these steps, the Russian Federation contemplates 
other means as well for the economic development in this area, 
such as a Black Sea Cooperation Bank, a consolidated

  [Text] New York, June 22 (CTK) -- "It cannot be ruled out 
that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia will be the strongest party after the September 
parliamentary elections but it will not be able to form a 
government," Slovak President Michal Kovac said today. 
  He said forming a new government would evidently be a task 
for a coalition which would probably be made of the political 
parties constituting the current government. 
  At a joint news conference with Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz here Kovac reiterated his support for the improved 
relations between Slovakia and Hungary which he said were not 
yet really good and neighborly. Kovac said that now, after the 
Hungarian parliamentary elections, new conditions are being 
created for general progress, including the progress in solving 
a dispute concerning the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project on the 
Danube. 
  Goncz confirmed that in this case technical questions are at 
issue but also political and national minority problems. He 
pointed out that Slovakia had not complied with recent 
recommendations by the European Union concerning the Gabcikovo 
dam.

<F P=106> ["From the Meetings of the French Parliamentary Delegation </F>
in Tirana" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, June 22 (ATA) 
<H5>  Talk With the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Commission </H5>
  On June 21 the French parliamentary delegation met with 
members of the Parliamentary Foreign Policy Commission of the 
People's Assembly led by the leader of this commission, Eduard 
Selami. Mr. Selami acquainted the French guests with the 
composition and the activity of this commission, which aims at 
the consolidation and expansion of the relations of cooperation 
with other countries. 
  The French parliamentarians took interest in the main 
directions of the foreign policy of Albania. Mr. Selami and 
other deputies stressed that the main direction of the foreign 
policy is Albania's integration in the European democratic 
structures and the guarantee of the peace and stability in the 
Balkan region. 
  A special place in the meeting was devoted to the relations 
of Albania with Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia [FYROM]. Albanian parliamentarians pointed out that 
the Greek party continues to manifest archaic concepts and 
stands and to make groundless and absurd accusations for 
allegedly the abuse of the rights of the Greek minority in 
Albania. Participants in the meeting said that relations with 
The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are generally good and 
that Albania has been continuously tolerant and has created many 
facilitation to the Macedonian state, holding that this stand 
serves the peace and stability in the region. Nevertheless, 
Albania has reserves as far as the observation of the rights of 
the Albanians in that republic is concerned and it is for the 
solution of the existing problems through dialogue and 
understanding between parties. The Macedonian party lacks the 
necessary predisposition for the promotion of the relations 
between the two countries, participants in the meeting said. 
  After highlighting the contribution of France to the 
democratic developments in Albania, the Democratic Party deputy, 
Petrika Minga, suggested to the French parliamentarians the 
reopening of the French Lyceum in Korce. It is a tradition that 
should be renewed and this is also a desire of the people of 
Korce. 
<H5>  Meeting With the Albanian Foreign Minister </H5>
  In the meeting held on the same day with the French 
parliamentarians, Alfred Serreqi, Albanian foreign minister, 
stressed the importance that Albania attaches to the relations 
with France in the moments of transition and its integration 
into Europe. Minister Serreqi made a panorama of the situation 
in the country and concentrated on the situation in the region, 
mainly on the relations of Albania with its neighbours. 
  Leader of the French parliamentary delegation, Mr. Denion 
[name as received], expressed the conviction that the relations 
of France with Albania will develop further. He expressed the 
opinion that Europe should play and active role to help the 
countries in the transition period and to make its contribution 
to the solution of their complex problems. Albania also merits 
the attention of Europe, he underlined. The French 
parliamentarians also took interest in the situation in Kosova 
and the perspective solution of the problem there.

<F P=106> ["Today" -- BTA lead] </F>
  [Excerpts] Sofia, June 22 (BTA) -- During the second day 
of consultations on the Judiciary Act, which passed late last 
week, President Zhelyu Zhelev received Prosecutor General Ivan 
Tatarchev and the 25-member Supreme Judicial Council headed by 
its chairman, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev. Supreme Court 
Chairman Ivan Grigorov set forth the council's opinion that 20 
texts of the law contravene the Constitution. In contrast to 
other council members, Ani Kruleva, director of the National 
Investigative Service (NIS), believes the president should not 
veto the law, which meets with approval from investigators. 
According to her, the Judiciary Act adequately regulates the 
structure and functions of the NIS, as well as the status of 
investigators. 
  President Zhelev, who is also Supreme Commander-in-Chief of 
the Armed Forces, today received Vice-Admiral Ventseslav Velkov, 
Commander of the Navy. The sides discussed the state of the 
Navy, ways to resolve its problems and the progress of reform, 
says a press release of the president's office. They exchanged 
views on the Breeze-94 Naval Exercise, the first in this country 
within the framework of the Partnership for Peace programme. 
Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Romania, Turkey, Greece and the 
United States will be taking part in it and Georgia will send 
observers. 
  Filip Dimitrov, leader of the Union of Democratic Forces 
(SDS), met with top-level representatives of the United Romany 
Alliance headed by Vasil Chaprazov, the SDS press office said. 
The Gypsy leaders expressed concern over the SDS's failure to 
commit itself sufficiently to the problems of the Gypsy 
community, which could make it easy prey to manipulations. Also 
on the agenda were national economic problems and prospects for 
cooperation between the two organizations for their resolution. 
  The Press Office of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
today 
denied stories in DEMOKRATSIYA, EXPRESS and OTECHESTVEN VESTNIK, 
misquoting a statement by socialist leader Zhan Videnov who 
spoke at a news conference yesterday [21 June]. The Press 
Office said questioners had asked Mr. Videnov to comment on the 
BSP's silence and lack of official stand on the census in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
and Skopje's policy on ethnic minority issues, to which he 
responded, "On the contrary, the Bulgarian Socialist Party was 
the only political force two and a half years ago to refuse to 
applaud the hasty unconditional recognition of the Republic of 
Macedonia, arguing that, predictably, such problems would arise 
between the two countries." According to Mr. Videnov, the 
language problem, the problem over the "Bulgarian" option in the 
census forms, and the "Macedonian" option in similar censuses in 
Bulgaria were bound to arise. He went on to say, "Disputes over 
the historical legacy were also bound to arise, and territorial, 
maybe even border disputes, are probably taking shape. No doubt, 
national security is another such area of which the two states 
have profoundly different concepts. For Skopje, it amounts to 
the presence of foreign troops on Macedonian territory, while 
Bulgaria sees it as balanced and peaceful relations with all of 
its neighbours, integrated into the European and world security 
systems. Thus the BSP cannot in the least be accused of taking a 
conformist, vague and inconsistent stand on these issues. They 
cannot mar Bulgarian-Macedonian relations, though many 
opportunities for their preventive settlement have been lost in 
the last two and a half years. Now, undoubtedly, the 
responsibility will have to be shouldered by the respective 
state institutions, and not by those who warned that the 
complicated configuration in the Balkans was fraught with grave 
difficulties." 
  National Bank Governor Todor Vulchev met today with members 
of the BSP leadership, national radio reported. Speaking to a 
radio reporter, BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva said the meeting 
had taken place at Mr. Vulchev's request. Doncho Konakchiev of 
the Socialists' top leadership said the BSP had asked for such a 
meeting much earlier and it had been occasioned, among other 
things, by vacancies on the central bank's Governing Board and 
forecasts about the exchange rate of the lev. 
  President Zhelev uses the political centre to fulfill his 
ambitions, Velislava Dureva of the Social Democracy Alliance 
within the BSP told a news conference today. [passage omitted] 
  Speaking at a news conference in Razgrad (northern 
Bulgaria), 
Nedim Gendzhev, former chief mufti, now leader of the Democratic 
Party of Justice, said he expected the World Bank to extend a $1 
million loan for the opening of food enterprises in northeastern 
Bulgaria (a region with a large ethnic Turk population), as well 
as for other projects in the region. Gendzhev believes the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference may rescind its decisions 
against Bulgaria. [passage omitted] 
  Experts of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and of 
the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions (KNSB) hold 
similar views on the government ordinance on permissible levels 
of pollutants in industrial units, the press learned from KNSB 
Deputy Chairman Zhelyazko Khristov today. The entry into force 
of the ordinance, scheduled for January 1, was postponed at the 
trade union's request. If it is enforced in its present shape, 
some 220,000 people working in a harmful environment will lose 
their social benefits, Dr. Khristov said. [passage omitted] 
  In an open letter to Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, the two 
influential trade unions -- KNSB and Podkrepa -- today called 
for the resignation of Culture Minister Ivaylo Znepolski. Their 
demand is motivated by what they see as a "disgraceful action 
aimed to eliminate the institutions which direct, create and 
popularize Bulgarian culture". 
  The customs office in Kyustendil has collected over 1.5 
million leva in fines for customs irregularities this year, 
BTA's correspondent reported. Cigarettes, batteries, water 
pumps and welders have been confiscated and 5 kilos of heroin 
has been seized.

  [Text] Sofia, June 22 (BTA) -- The leader of the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party (BSP) Zhan Videnov today met with Yugoslav 
Ambassador Rados Smilkovic, the BSP Press Office reported. 
  At the meeting, which was held at the ambassador's request, 
the two shared views on bilateral cooperation on the state and 
political-party level. Smilkovic commended the BSP role in the 
Bulgarian-Yugoslav dialogue, said the Press Office. Smilkovic 
showed interest in the assessments and decisions of the 41st

  [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Representatives of the two 
major political forces in Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Socialist 
Party (BSP, the former Communists) and the opposition Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) elaborated on their parties' stands on 
the census in the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. 
  "SDS is anxious about the census. Despite the large number 
of foreign observers, we are apprehensive that the population of 
the Republic of Macedonia lacks the democratic psychological and 
political environment required for free expression," said Mr. 
Asparukh Panov, deputy chairman of the National Coordinating 
Council of SDS and member of the parliamentary Foreign Policy 
Committee. SDS is skeptical mainly because of the considerable 
politicization of the ruling Macedonian Socialist Party which 
organizes the census taking and because of the fuelling of 
anti-Bulgarian attitudes, evidently to be used in the 
forthcoming election campaign. 
  "As a political force we have always maintained an explicit 
and resolute stand on Macedonia, which we took in 1992 when the 
SDS government recognized that country's independence," Mr. 
Panov pointed out. He added that SDS firmly believes that a 
sovereign, independent Macedonia is a guarantor of balance and 
stability in the Balkans. 
  "The Bulgarian Socialist Party is the only political force 
which two years ago refused to applaud the recognition of the 
Republic of Macedonia which was no doubt a hasty action, said 
BSP leader Zhan Videnov in response to a reporter's question 
about the census in Macedonia. According to Mr. Videnov, the 
problems with the language, the historical inheritance and the 
`Bulgarian' option in the census forms were bound to arise. 
  ``We shall always defend the Bulgarian history, the 
Bulgarian 
national spirit, Bulgarian cultural and historical sites and we 
hope that Macedonia would respond to our open and democratic 
policy in a similar manner,'' Mr. Panov pointed out. 
  Mr. Videnov is apprehensive about possible territorial 
claims 
and arguments between Bulgaria and Macedonia. The two states 
have a profoundly different concept of national security. "To 
Skopje national security is guaranteed by the presence of 
foreign military forces on the republic's territory, while 
Bulgaria seeks to achieve it through balanced and peaceful 
relations with its neighbours and integration with the European 
and world security structures," he explained. In his opinion, 
many chances for preventive settlement of problems between 
Bulgaria and Macedonia have been missed in the past two years 
and it is the respective state institutions that are to be held 
responsible and not the ones who were warning against the 
complications threatening to ensue from the involved 
configurations in the Balkans.

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva and Kiril Vulchev: "SDS To Boycott </F>
Parliament Until It Opts For Elections"] 
  [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- The anti-communist Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) will continue its month-old boycott of 
parliament until the National Assembly "clearly demonstrates a 
will for the initiation of elections this autumn." In a special 
address circulated this afternoon, the SDS National Coordinating 
Council (top political leadership) calls for united action on 
all democratic forces sharing the SDS principles and policy 
documents. 
  For more than a year and a half now, the SDS has been trying 
in vain to precipitate early general elections (regular 
elections are due in the autumn of 1995). At its congress in 
early June, the ex- communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) 
declared itself in favour of elections this coming autumn. 
Extraparliamentary parties are also clamouring for early 
elections. On May 26, the Lyuben Berov Cabinet was voted 
confidence by parliament on the strength of a programme which 
covers the period ending this September. On May 20, parliament 
voted down the structural cabinet changes proposed by the prime 
minister. The SDS saw Prof. Berov's refusal to resign in the 
wake of the latter vote as a violation of the constitution which 
illegitimizes the government. The SDS petitioned the 
Constitutional Court to rule on the matter. The Court's ruling 
was announced today. According to it, the prime minister need 
not resign when parliament votes down any cabinet changes he may 
move. 
  SDS Filip Dimitrov and BSP leader Zhan Videnov met yesterday 
to discuss ways of achieving early elections. They, however, 
failed to reach agreement. "SDS warns of the danger of turning 
the Bulgarian Parliament, controlled by BSP and its satellites, 
into a machine for recommunization of the country and for 
relapse into the methods of the half-century-old communist 
dictatorship," today's SDS address says. The coalition sees 
elections as the only way out. The union remains committed to 
the position, reaffirmed at its latest national conference in 
May, that it will not take part in the formation of a new 
government within the lifetime of the incumbent parliament. 
  BSP leader Zhan Videnov says SDS would not provide 
guarantees 
of early parliamentary elections. "The intra-coalition problems 
which are taking the upper hand in the SDS deny it the 
possibility to implement flexible and pragmatic policy and that 
is why the resolutions of the SDS National Conference are 
followed blindly," the BSP leader emphasized.

  [Text] Sofia, June 21 (BTA) -- Today President Zhelyu 
Zhelev started consultations on the Judiciary Organization Act. 
He has the right to refer it back to parliament for review. 
His first meeting was with supreme magistrates: Supreme Court 
Chairman Ivan Grigorov and his deputies, the chairwoman of the 
Regional Court of Sofia, etc. This is a modern and democratic 
act, but there are certain passages that contradict the 
constitution, apart from being undemocratic and immoral, Mr. 
Grigorov said. These passages, however, account for no more 
than 3 percent of the act. 
  Mr. Grigorov maintains that the act cannot become operative 
immediately on the authority of Clause 4 of the Transitional and 
Concluding Provisions of the Constitution, which reads: "The 
organization of the judicial branch of government... shall come 
into force following the passage of the new structural and 
procedural laws." On the motion of an MP of the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliament voted that the act should come into 
force upon its publishing in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE. The most 
controversial paragraphs are those concerning the years of 
service required for the holding of key posts in the judiciary 
system. Supreme Court Chairman Ivan Grigorov and Prosecutor 
General Ivan Tatarchev do not meet that requirement. 
  The Constitutional Court should rule on the Judiciary 
Organization Act, Justice Minister Petur Kornazhev told a news 
conference today. He will point that out at his consultations 
with President Zhelev tomorrow [22 June]. Members of the 
Supreme Judicial Council, the Prosecutor's Office and the 
Supreme Council of the Bar will also meet with the president 
tomorrow.

  [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- An overriding unwillingness 
to decentralize the state is one of the reasons for putting off 
discussion of the constitutional bill on the creation of higher 
units of local administration, Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) 
Deputy Oldrich Kuzilek told journalists today. 
  He said the government's failure today to support the bill, 
put forward by ODA Deputy Chairman Jan Kalvoda, was the result 
of excessive procrastination with regard to the material, which 
had been at the government's disposal for a long time. 
  Unwillingness to discuss the material was also the result of 
some coalition parties being unable to form an opinion on the 
issue. "I could show most evidence of this inability in the 
Civic Democratic Party (ODS)," Kuzilek said. 
  Chairman of the Deputies' Group of the Christian Democratic 
Party (KDS), Marek Benda, said the government's decision could 
have been expected. "There were fairly substantial reservations 
towards the material, and from different coalition parties," he 
told journalists. The fact that the government was going to 
discuss the problem again next week was a signal that there was, 
however, a will to finish dealing with it, he said. 
  With regard to speculation that the government might suggest 
shifting the deadline of June 30 by which it had undertaken to 
put a bill on the matter before parliament, Benda said he did 
not believe the KDS would consider June 30 uncrossable. 
  While KDS leaders would be willing to consider putting back 
the deadline, they were not able to consider rewriting the 
constitution. "For us, the constitution is a law which we intend 
to honor," Benda said.

  [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- The government today 
approved a Czech-Slovak agreement on support for and mutual 
protection of investments, Deputy Premier Ivan Kocarnik told 
journalists. 
  The text, which had been approved by the Slovaks, includes 
provisions reflecting the fact that both states used to be 
members of a federation, Kocarnik said. 
  The agreement was first drawn up before the split but has 
never been approved in parliament.

  [Text] Prague, June 21 (CTK) -- Results of a recent 
"giant" poll surveying political preferences among almost 12,000 
Czech residents "exactly illustrate the thesis that the support 
of government policy spreads across (all) social layers," writes 
the latest issue of the Czech political weekly RESPEKT. 
  The poll recently conducted by the Center of Empirical 
Research (STEM) showed that only three of the four right-wing 
government coalition parties and three of the six opposition 
parties would gain parliamentary seats in the elections "if held 
tomorrow", Vladimir Mlynar states in the paper. 
  According to the poll, the coalition Civic Democratic Party 
(ODS) would fill more than one-third of parliament, while the 
Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) would gain 12 and 7 
percent of votes respectively. (At present the ODS has 65 
deputies in the 200-seat Czech Parliament, and the ODA and the 
KDU-CSL each 15.) 
  As to the opposition, the Czech Social Democratic Party 
(CSSD) and the Left Bloc grouping (LB, including communists) 
would be given each 13 percent of votes. The extreme-right 
opposition Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican 
Party (SPR-RSC) would follow with 5 percent. 
  "At least from two points of view, the situation in the 
Czech 
Republic is the same as that two years ago: The ODS would again 
absolutely win the elections, and every fifth Czech would again 
vote for the extreme political forces -- the communists and the 
Sladek-led republicans," Mlynar comments. 
  "It is interesting that only a little more than one-third of 
the population claims to support the right-wing parties, while 
full 40 percent say they back the center policy (the remaining 
20 percent are followers of left-wing parties). In simple 
words: At least two people out of five preferring the parties 
describing themselves as right-oriented, claim their support for 
the center. This logically implies that almost a half of the 
followers of the (right-wing government) coalition policy do not 
view this policy as a right-wing but as a center one," Mlynar 
writes. 
  He also focuses on the extent of the support given to Czech 
political parties by individual population groups. If the 
elections were attended only by workers, who form the 
traditionally left-orientated part of the society, the 
government coalition would win with 40 percent of their votes 
(out of which 25 percent would be gained by the ODS, and 10 
percent and 5 percent by the ODA and the KDU-CSL respectively). 
Only one-fourth of the workers would prefer the left-wing 
parties (the CSSD -- 16 percent, the LB -- 8 percent). 
  The coalition's election victory would be sure among 
entrepreneurs (the ODS, the ODA and the KDU-CSL would gain 49, 
15 and 4 percent respectively), Mlynar states. 
  "The forces are less or more balanced with pensioners -- 
one- 
third of them wants to vote for the right wing, while only a 
little less (28 percent) are supporters of the left-leaning 
opposition," he continues. 
  The unemployed equally split concerning political parties. 
They would give the 17-percent support to the SPR-RSC, 16 
percent of votes to the ODS, while most of the remaining parties 
each would gain about 10 percent from them. 
  With the other layers of the society, such as clerks, 
tradesmen and even housewives, the predominance of the coalition 
parties is more than evident, Mlynar says. 
  The coalition would also clearly win among "specialists", 
that is intellectuals. However, the poll surprisingly showed 
that almost seven percent of these people were intending to vote 
for SPR-RSC leader Miroslav Sladek, Mlynar points out. 
  "With the exception of the ODS, which -- with a certain 
simplification -- could be viewed as the party backed by 
entrepreneurs and clerks, our parties have not any firm social 
backing as yet," Mlynar writes. "Although party preferences have 
not undergone any significant changes during long months, there 
still exists a certain space for change. In other words, there 
still remains a chance for an opposition pursuing a reasonable 
policy," Mlynar comments. 
  However, a miracle would probably have to occur for, let us 
say, present social democrats to succeed in addressing the 
workers. The first pre-requisite would have to be a change of 
party rhetoric, which is, as permanently proved by CSSD Chairman 
Milos Zeman, above the party's capability, Mlynar adds.

  [Text] Prague, June 22 (CTK) -- At its session today the 
cabinet did not approve a constitutional bill on higher 
self-governing units which has been submitted by Deputy Premier 
Jan Kalvoda, Deputy Premier Ivan Kocarnik told reporters today. 
  However, the cabinet must submit the bill to parliament by 
June 30, Kocarnik added. 
  He said the government had thoroughly discussed the document 
which anticipated the creation of 13 units which would include 
units formed on the basis of administrative centers of the 
former regions (Brno is a chief city of the former South 
Moravian region) and new districts of Karlovy Vary, Liberec, 
Pardubice, Jihlava, Olomouc and Zlin. 
  According to the bill, Prague and Central Bohemia would form 
one unit. 
  There were initially seven regions (five Czech and two 
Moravian) - Central Bohemia with Prague as a chief city, South 
Bohemia - Pardubice, West Bohemia - Plzen, North Bohemia - Usti 
nad Labem, East Bohemia - Hradec Kralove, South Moravia - Brno 
and North Moravia - Ostrava. The city of Prague was also a 
region. These regions were abolished in 1991, and 72 districts 
came into existence instead.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 Jun (MTI) -- Having provided 
scientific and methodological help to support the environmental 
rehabilitation of former Soviet military facilities in 
East-Central Europe, NATO now wants to set up a reference 
military base in order take the process one step further. 
  According to preliminary plans, the base would be built on 
the military facility near the town of Komarom (N. Hungary), 
which Soviet troops used for nearly half a century. The new 
base will provide scientific training for experts, and display 
various methods for environmental protection. 
  The plan was disclosed in Komarom on Wednesday [22 June], 
when NATO members from the division of science and environmental 
protection, who are currently holding talks in Hungary, visited 
the heavily polluted facility. Construction will be carried out 
by NATO's environmental protection section and the joint 
research centre of the Budapest Technical University and the 
State University of Florida.

  [Text] Bratislava, 22 June (MTI) -- The future Hungarian 
prime minister, Gyula Horn, is expected to visit Bratislava in 
July. The Hungarian-Slovak basic agreement could possibly be 
signed during the summer, and it seems certain that Slovak 
President Michal Kovac will visit Hungary prior to Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz's visit to Banska Bystrica at the end of 
August. 
  This was reported by the international secretary of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Hars, in Bratislava on 
Wednesday [22 June], after his talks with leaders of several 
major political forces. 
  In an interview with MTI, Hars said the aim of his visit was 
to inform his partners in Bratislava about his party's foreign 
policy concepts prior to the MSZP taking over government. 
  Hars said Slovakia has a priority place in the MSZP's 
foreign 
policy. 
  The MSZP is ready to sign the Hungarian-Slovak basic 
agreement, together with the border guarantees. 
  The politician was of the opinion that this could perhaps 
take place during Horn's visit to Slovakia, prior to the Slovak 
elections scheduled for the autumn. 
  During his visit, Hars held talks with the vice-president of 
the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), Erzsebet Borza, an 
ethnic Hungarian, and the party's ethnic Hungarian parliamentary 
deputy, Jozsef Zselenak. 
  Hars also met former Slovak Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky, 
the chairman of the Slovak Christian Democratic Movement (KDH); 
the vice-president of the Vladimir Meciar-led Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Ivan Lexa; the section director of 
the Slovak Foreign Ministry, Frantisek Dlhopolsky, and the 
chairman of the Coexistence movement, Miklos Duray.

  [Text] Budapest, 22 June (MTI) -- The coalition 
negotiation delegations of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) 
and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) agreed on all issues 
during their talks on Wednesday [22 June]. All that now remains 
is to clarify a few parts of the text of the agreement, MSZP 
Chairman Gyula Horn, the prime minister candidate, announced on 
Wednesday evening. 
  During ten-hours of talks today, the two sides finalized an 
agreement on the the SZDSZ providing the minister of the 
interior, the minister of culture and education, and the 
minister in charge of infrastructure affairs. 
  The MSZP will provide politicians to head the other nine 
ministries and the only minister without portfolio of the new 
government -- the one in charge of the National Security Office, 
  The government will have SZDSZ political state secretaries 
in 
five ministries: the Interior Ministry, Infrastructure Affairs, 
the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and 
the Ministry of Agriculture. 
  As compared to the agreement discussed two days ago, the 
SZDSZ has gained an additional state secretary post: that in 
the Foreign Ministry. 
  The parties also agreed in the distribution of parliamentary 
posts. 
  The coalition agreement is expected to be signed on Friday 
[24 June]. 
  The coalition talks are to continue on Thursday [23 June] 
afternoon, when personnel issues will be discussed. In other 
words, at that time the parties hope to concretely agree on the 
personalities who will head the ministries. 
  The coalition document includes an agreement on holding a 
referendum to decide on the possible membership of Hungary in 
NATO. 
  As regards the Budapest Expo planned for 1996, the matter 
will be included in the document in a way which states that the 
situation will have to be further examined, both for the 
consequences of a possible cancellation, and the profits that 
would accompany successful organization.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 June (MTI) -- Over the last four 
years, plans envisaged the full or partial privatization of 
nearly 2,000 state-owned companies in Hungary. State 
institutions in charge of privatization marketed nearly a 
quarter of the firms in full, and about one third in part. 
Furthermore, many firms had to be converted to meet market 
standards, and several had to be closed. 
  Privatization began in Hungary in 1989. It is directly 
implemented by two state institutions, the State Property Agency 
(AVU), which sees to the sale of state firms, and the State 
Holding Co., which has, since 1992, overseen the assets 
remaining in state ownership. 
  In 1990, the AVU was authorized to privatize a total of 
1,844 
companies and business associations. Over the last four years, 
nearly 500 firms were fully privatized, and more than 700 in 
part. An additional 477 are under liquidation. The management 
of another 250 firms has to be handed over to other 
organizations and state institutions. The State Holding Co., 
for instance, received 1,500. The remaining, nearly 40, firms 
are currently under reorganization. Privatization revenues of 
the State Property Agency totalled 210.3 billion forints [HUF] 
(approx. $2 billion) over the last four years, until May 1994. 
Foreign capital valued at HUF93.9 billion was invested in the 
course of privatization, which is nearly 45 percent of the total 
revenue. A quarter of firms managed by the AVU now have foreign 
stakes. The highest foreign proportion is found in mines (67 
percent) and in energy industry firms (72 percent), and foreign 
ownership in processing also totals one third. However, a large 
part of the assets sold outright by the State Property Agency 
are now owned by Hungarian private ventures. In order to boost 
internal demand, the government helped Hungarian customers 
involved in privatization with several preferential loans: The 
Privatization Loan, the Start Loan, and the most frequently used 
E-Loan (Existence Loan). Hungarian firms purchased assets both 
for cash and preferential loans, in equal parts, and citizens 
purchased nearly 12 percent of the privatized state assets (to a 
value of approx. HUF25 billion) with compensation coupons. 
  The AVU spent more than 30 percent of revenues from 
privatization on state debt repayment, 10 percent on maintaining 
the level of businesses, and the finanicng of reorganization. 
Asset transfers, state obligations (for instance, allocations 
for the World Expo), and the liquidation of unsalable companies 
(severance pay for workers) accounted for about 50 percent of 
spending. Other incidental expenses, and the running of the AVU 
also accounted for expenditures. 
  When founded in 1992, the State Holding Co. began the 
business management of 163 large companies in which the state 
intended to remain the owner, either fully or in part. The 
total capital of these firms, received from the AVU, was nearly 
HUF1,500-1,600 billion in 1992, of which nearly HUF600 billion 
was the share planned for privatization. Since its founding, 
the State Holding Co. has concluded 10 privatization contracts, 
the most important of which were the privatization of nearly 
one-third of the Hungarian Telecommunications Co. ($850 
million), the agreement between the Hungarian and the Italian 
airlines MALEV-ALITALIA ($70 million), and the sale of Chinoin 
Pharmaceuticals ($75 million).

  [Text] Budapest, 22 June (MTI) -- One of the most important 
results Hungary's outgoing government has achieved is the 
partial compensation of the politically persecuted of the 
communist era, and those whose properties were nationalized 
without any refund. So far, over 1.3 million applications have 
been accepted, and further 600,000 additional claims were 
submitted at the beginning of this year. The state allocated 
compensation coupons exceeding a nominal value of 100 billion 
forints [HUF] (approx. $1 billion), and experts expect 1.5 times 
as many to be distributed in the future. The new government 
intends to speed up the process. 
  Compensation began three years ago. The parties of the 1990 
government coalition (Hungarian Democratic Forum, Independent 
Smallholders' Party, Christian Democratic People's Party) 
focussed on compensating people who lost their porperties in the 
late 1940's or early 1950's. They believed that citizens kept 
in custody or deported for political reasons should be similarly 
treated. Later the government included the victims of fascism 
and their relatives. 
  The economic condition of Hungary not allowing to pay total 
damages, the government only initiated partial compensation. 
The opposition parties fully agreed to settling grievances on 
moral levels, but excluded financial means foreseeing this would 
further saddle the economy. 
  Being in majority, government parties could get their will 
through in parliament. Over 900,000 people have been 
compensated for lost properties, and over 300,000 for having 
been politically persecuted. 
  In case of nationalized properties, the entitled ones have 
received compensation coupons in proportion to their losses. 
These coupons can be sold, as well as used for purchasing state 
assets or land. They could be also exchanged for annuities. 
Nearly half a million people acquired land through compensation. 
  Compensation coupons have also been introduced on the stock 
exchange, their rate of exchange depending on the shares in 
state companies available for them. Their rate of exchange 
reached a peak at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994, 
when prospering state firms that have been introduced on the 
stock market regularly offered their shares for coupons. Those 
who were patient enough bought shares and later could sell them 
on the stock market well above the nominal value of the 
compensation coupons. Many people, especially the elderly, 
decided not to wait for the issuance of shares, but sold their 
coupons at the daily exchange rate or below, thus obtaining a 
much smaller amount than possible. Some individuals and brokers 
who bought coupons at low prices managed to accumulate 
significant fortunes. If spent on state properties, the 
interest rates of compensation coupons are included in their 
exchange rate. 
  The Compensation Office and its auxiliary offices, employing 
a staff of 1,200, have already judged 1.5 million applications, 
most of them favorably. According to general opinion, they have 
successfully overcome bureaucratic delays. After four decades, 
many found it difficult to certify their once-owned properties. 
In cases like that, the officials only required two witnesses 
for testifying the genuineness of a claim. Yet the number and 
value of shares fell far behind the quantity and nominal value 
of compensation coupons. Therefore, banks were flooded by huge 
crowds at issuing times. 
  The former opposition parties that won the May 1994 
elections 
promised they would continue compensation as prescribed by law. 
There is some uncertainty, however, over the extent of the 
possible realization of their intentions. According to their 
recent statements, one of the first moves of the Socialists will 
be to cut central spending, and implement a tight monetary 
policy. They wish to continue privatization with more 
efficiency and with simultaneous efforts to reduce unemployment. 
The question is how the allocation of over HUF200 billion 
private investment can be fitted into this programme, knowing 
there has been only HUF30 million coverage used for the 
open-ended compensation coupons issued so far.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 23 -- Former Finance Minister Marek 
Borowski stressed the continuity between the government's 
"Strategy for Poland" and the economic programme of its 
predecessor during Thursday's Sejm debate on the strategy. 
  He told his political opponents in the so-called 
constructive 
opposition that "imitation is not forbidden." He recalled that 
during the last Sejm the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) when in 
opposition had supported some of the proposals of the government. 
  The basic pre-condition for the success of the strategy was 
the lowering of inflation, Borowski said. That was why the 
government had to find sources of financing its budget deficit 
beyond the banking sector. He said that the SLD thought that 
foreign capital was such a source. 
  Borowski said the SLD did not favour lowering taxes for the 
most well off. 
  He added that the constructive opposition should remember 
that some of the points in the strategy would be ready for 
implementation in three years time, when the present opposition 
may form the government. 
  Waldemar Michna of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) said the 
strategy created a harmony between the free market and state 
interventionism. The strategy was based on factors dependent on 
people not on capital. 
  All the parties which left the Sejm two weeks ago when 
Finance Minister Kolodko introduced the strategy maintained that 
the strategy was too general and full of wishful thinking. 
  Tadeusz Syryjczyk of the Freedom Union (UW) saw in the 
strategy a realism in evaluating the recent past, common sense 
in microeconomic matters and in agricultural policy. However he 
added that there were also aspects to the strategy which raised 
some doubts. He was not sure if the idea of a management board 
for state property was not aimed against privatisation. Neither 
was it clear what role local government was to play. 
  In addition the strategy did not say whether there was too 
much or too little welfare expenditure. 
  Labour Union (UP) leader Ryszard Bugaj said that the 
strategy 
contained no real macroeconomic or industrial policy. He said 
that there were too much tax relief for the already rich and 
there was no provision made for increasing pensions or the wages 
of public sector workers. 
  Wojciech Blasiak of the Confederation for an Independent 
Poland (KPN) said that the strategy meant the "Latinisation" of 
Poland. He said that continuing the policy imposed by the IMF 
and the World Bank meant that it was a strategy for "dependent, 
peripheral economic development." 
  Jerzy Eysymontt of the Non-Party Reform Bloc (BBWR) said his 
grouping was treating the strategy as a declaration of intent 
but had serious doubts concerning privatisation, investment 
finance and export. The BBWR would still be considering how to 
vote on the strategy, he added.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 21 -- Irish President Mary Robinson met 
with President Lech Walesa at the start of her official visit to 
Poland on Tuesday. 
  Robinson, the first Irish president to visit Poland, was 
greeted in front of the Belvedere presidential palace by Walesa, 
the Sejm and Senate speakers, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and 
Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski. 
  During his talks with the Irish president, Walesa presented 
problems faced by Poland in the course of economic and political 
transformations and pointed to the need to intensify the process 
of integration between central European states and the European 
Union. 
  Walesa told Irish journalists after the meeting that he is 
impatient with a slow pace of Poland's integration with the 
European Union [EU]. He said Poland and other countries in 
eastern Europe have huge potentials, which have yet to be used. 
  Mary Robinson pointed out that Ireland was the first country 
to have ratified the agreement on Poland's association with the 
EU. She contended that she is aware of Polish aspirations to 
become a member of the EU but stressed this will not be a fast 
process. 
  After the wreath-laying ceremonies at the tomb of the 
unknown 
soldier and at the monument to the Warsaw uprising, Mary 
Robinson visited Warsaw's museum of literature. 
  Later in the day, the Irish guest was awarded the John Field 
medal during a ceremony at the Frederic Chopin Society for her 
contribution to the development of Polish-Irish cultural 
contacts. 
  The situation of the European Union, the question of 
Poland's 
coming closer to west European structures and bilateral 
Polish-Irish relations constituted the main topics of talks held 
by Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski and Irish Deputy Prime 
Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Dick Spring. 
  Spring recognized Irish relations with Poland as a priority 
in the process of establishing ties between the European Union 
and central and east European countries. 
  Olechowski presented to Spring Poland's position on its 
integration with the European Union before the EU summit to be 
held on the Greek island of Corfu June 24-25. He pointed to the 
necessity of an unequivocal decision on the part of the European 
union related to Poland's future membership of the EU.

  [Text] Warsaw, June 22--Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej 
Olechowski on Wednesday expressed satisfaction over Russia's 
joining the "Partnership for Peace" plan on Wednesday. 
  He said that Russia's joining the "Partnership" on the same 
terms as other partners is in the interest of Poland. "And it 
has happened that way. Russia has joined the programme within 
the framework of the same general document," Olechowski said. 
  Earlier in the day, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev 
sidestepped the issues of Poland's bid for the membership of 
NATO. He told newsmen that Russia has excellent relations with 
Poland. So are my relations with my "good friend" Andrzej 
Olechowski, he said. 
  Speaking at a news conference with NATO Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino after the signing ceremony at the NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, Kozyrev was asked by Polish 
journalists whether Russia will be friendly towards Poland's 
NATO membership and whether it sets any conditions after it has 
signed a far-reaching cooperative relationship with NATO. He 
answered that the only condition of all actions is that they 
"fit into the building of a stable, united, democratic Europe 
from Vancouver to Vladivostok." 
  He went on to say that "being equal members of Europe and 
equal partners of NATO, we have equal rights to speak out our 
mind with Poland."

  [Text] Warsaw, ROMPRES, 22/6/1994 -- Polish-Romanian 
relations are based on good, centuries-old traditions, Poland's 
Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrzej Olechowski told a ROMPRES 
correspondent on the eve of the visit to Warsaw of Romania's 
Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu. 
  "Over the past few years our relations have been normal, 
without any tensions or problems, although the contacts at 
various levels have not been very intense," the chief of the 
Polish diplomacy said. 
  "Poland wishes that our countries could give a more 
substantial core to their bilateral cooperation, mainly in the 
economic sphere. One must openly admit that in this respect 
Polish-Romanian cooperation is dissatisfactory, and that we must 
act together towards improving this state of things. That is 
why Mr. Melescanu and I shall sign two important agreements that 
will ensure the legal background apt to dynamism the economic 
exchanges. We shall also sign a cultural agreement. The 
dialogue Poland and Romania are having can be very important in 
the context of the general search for means to ensure security 
and stability in our region. Our countries have both signed the 
documents of the Partnership for Peace. I am sure this is a 
good basis for a fruitful exchange of views and swap of 
experience in this field too."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 22/6/1994 -- The Romanian 
Foreign Ministry welcomes the Russian Federation's decision to 
join in the NATO Partnership for Peace [PFP] scheme and 
appreciates this political act to be a significant contribution 
to the consolidation of a climate of security and stability, 
told a news conference the Foreign Ministry spokesman on 22 June. 
  From this angle, the Romanian diplomat added, the Foreign 
Ministry has made some points in connection with certain 
statements regarding the granting to the Russian Federation of a 
special status within the Partnership for Peace: the 
discriminatory character of the partnership was to Romania the 
main argument to accept this initiative. 
  "Our country", the spokesman added, "along with the other 
states, is aware of the importance of the Russian Federation's 
role in ensuring stability and security in Europe and considers 
it natural that the relation of cooperation between the NATO and 
Russia should materialize in an individual, substantive and 
comprehensive program of partnership that should reflect 
Russia's status, importance, ability and wish to help in 
attaining the partnership participants' common objectives. 
However, this relation must not alter the prime requisite of 
equality among the states participating in the partnership. In 
this context, the Romanian Foreign Ministry considers that the 
specific contribution the Russian Federation can make to 
security and stability in Europe, by developing constructive 
relations with the North-Atlantic Alliance can be fully 
reflected in the Partnership for Peace." 
  As announced by the Spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Romania, the premier of the State Council of the 
People's Republic of China, Li Peng, will be on an official 
visit in Romania over 9-12 July to examine with the host country 
the present stage and the prospects for the development of the 
friendship and cooperation relations between China and Romania, 
and to sign a number of documents, such as the joint declaration 
on the friendship and cooperation relations between Romania and 
the People's republic of China, economic, commercial and 
cultural agreements. 
  Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu will be in Warsaw on 23 
and 
24 June for an official visit, and on 28 June he will be in 
London for a working visit in Great Britain.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- Adrian Nastase, the 
speaker of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania's Parliament had 
an interview Wednesday, 22 June, with Babken Ararktsyan, 
chairman of the Supreme Council of Armenia, head of a 
parliamentary delegation representing Armenia at the third 
plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea 
Economic Cooperation Zone. 
  During the talks expressed were the two sides' hopes and 
wishes to boost ties between the two countries. Mentioned in 
the context was the stimulative factor for boosting bilateral 
ties represented by the ethnic Armenian community in Romania. 
  Also appreciated was the friendly character of ties between 
Romania and Armenia, stress being laid on the centuries-old 
cultural and spiritual traditions. Emphasized was the 
significant role played by the two parliaments for a better 
mutual acquaintance and an agreement was reached to set up 
parliamentary groups of friendship and to arrange swaps of 
parliamentary delegations for the ensuing period. 
  Both sides shared the idea that legislative solutions can 
become mutual sources of inspiration in their efforts to solve 
political, economic, and social issues in a period of transition 
crossed by Romania and by Armenia as well.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia will likely 
apply for European Union (EU) membership after the ratification 
of its association agreement with the EU by the parliaments of 
the "Twelve," State Secretary in the Slovak Foreign Ministry 
Lubor Bystricky told CTK today. 
  "It can happen next year," he added. 
  "However, when Slovakia applies for EU membership will 
depend 
primarily on the process of ratification of the association 
agreement by the individual [EU] states. Neither from the 
formal, nor from the political points of view would it be wise 
to jump the gun in this process. It could be perceived as an 
expression of unprofessional impatience," Bystricky said. 
  "It would also be of no use to apply for membership only out 
of prestige," Bystricky said, referring to the necessity of 
adjusting Slovakia's norms to the EU ones. 
  Bystricky said his comments did not refer to Hungary or 
Poland which have already applied for EU membership. 
  He said he expected the association agreement to be ratified 
by the EU countries' parliaments by the end of this year, 
despite the fact that to date only Denmark, Great Britain and 
Portugal have done so. 
  "Slovakia will apply for fully-fledged membership at the 
next 
EU Council session," Bystricky said, adding that it could 
achieve its goal "at the turn of the millennium." 
  However, a necessary prerequisite for this to become reality 
is that "there are not any changes in the internal political 
development in the autumn parliamentary elections and that 
forces rejecting the "four European freedoms" -- freedom of 
movement for work force, capital, goods and services -- will not 
gain the upper hand, Bystricky said. Under the association 
agreement, conditions for their introduction must be created in 
Slovakia in ten years. 
  He said that the measures like an import surcharge or 
certificates (on goods imported to Slovakia) do not run counter 
to the efforts at integration. "The government could not afford 
to introduce measures that would be at variance with the 
association agreement; the agreement provides for sanctions if 
this happened," Bystricky said. He also dismissed the suspicion 
of an alleged discrimination of Czech exporters, unlike EU 
exporters, and spoke in favor of as quick as possible conclusion 
of a Slovak-Czech agreement on mutual recognition of 
certificates on goods quality on the basis of EU norms.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Although it is still 
not known how the Hungarian minority parties will go into 
Slovakia's autumn elections, their most likely strategy is a 
coalition -- either between Egyutteles [Coexistence] and the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) on their own or 
with the addition of the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS). 
  Egyutteles and the MKDH are both in the five-party coalition 
government of Jozef Moravcik, while the MOS is a minor non- 
parliamentary party. 
  The prospect of coupling with a third Hungarian party has 
become something of an apple of discord between Egyutteles and 
the MKDH. Initially Egyutteles propounded a coalition embracing 
all four Hungarian parties in Slovakia, which the MKDH opposed. 
Egyutteles now does not directly reject the idea of a three-way 
coalition but it is seeking reassurances from the MOS that after 
election MOS deputies will not desert the Hungarian bloc for 
some right-of-center Slovak party. 
  The situation is further complicated by personal antipathy 
between Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray and MOS Chairman Laszlo 
Nagy, who in the past has criticized the former for nationalism. 
  The MKDH backs MOS admission to the loose coalition 
currently 
existing with Egyutteles so that, in the words of MKDH chairman 
Vojtech Bugar, "not one Hungarian vote is lost" 
  Egyutteles deputy Edita Bauerova said at a party press 
conference today that the MKDH had, however, not yet stated its 
conditions for any such coalition. 
  A two- or three-party coalition will not affect requirements 
for entry to parliament. For both, a minimum of seven per cent 
of the vote is needed. Observers agree a four-party Hungarian 
coalition is probably out of the question because it would 
require ten percent of the vote. The Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia (i.e. the voting base for the Hungarian bloc) numbers 
some 560,000 people, 10.8 percent of the total population. 
  Egyutteles is also toying with the idea of including 
candidates from the fourth minority party, the Hungarian 
People's Party (MLS, also non-parliamentary) on its election 
lists, as the law allows, but the MKDH does not hide its 
objections to this strategy. 
  Whatever the outcome of these pre-electoral maneuvers, 
observers believe Egyutteles and the MKDH will retain their 
ability to tip the scales in favor of the anti-Meciar government. 
  General elections will be held in Slovakia on September 30 
and October 1.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- The National 
Democratic Party (NDS) and the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU) 
may merge after the autumn parliamentary elections, NDS Chairman 
Ludovit Cernak told journalists today. 
  The June polls gave three percent to the NDS (5 deputies in 
the 150-seat Slovak parliament) and six percent to Premier Jozef 
Moravcik's DU (14 deputies). 
  Two weeks ago Moravcik offered the NDS to run on the DU 
slate 
and to get three seats in parliament provided the parties 
succeed in the elections, Cernak said. 
  On Saturday [18 June] the NDS central council approved a 
decision of its executive committee to join the DU list of 
candidates. This is the best way for the party how to "appeal 
to non-left-orientated and non-Meciarite" voters, Cernak said. 
  The decision is subject to approval by the DU national 
council which will take place on Saturday. Although it had 
opted for a separate candidature in the elections, it is likely 
to change the tack. 
  Two weeks ago Cernak said that the "NDS is almost certain to 
run the elections on the KDH (Christian Democratic Movement) 
list." At present, the offers from the DU and KDH are "of about 
the same quality," Cernak stated.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Trade is the most 
important question of relations between Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus tells today's independent 
SME. 
  "The development in this sphere has made us rather sad. You 
know that the whole problem of the bureaucratic troubles, the 
whole problem of certificates (on May 1, Slovakia introduced 
quality certificates on imported foods, thus making Czech 
exports more difficult) is quite unpleasant, unwelcome for the 
Czech Republic," he adds. 
  Klaus says the Czech Republic was rather disillusioned when 
it found that during a visit by Rene Steichen, the commissioner 
for agriculture and rural development in the European 
Commission, "Slovakia agreed it would not demand certain 
certificates from European Union countries, while it would still 
demand them from the Czech Republic," Klaus says. 
  The abolishment of the old clearing bloc in Czech-Slovak 
accounting is not a fundamental question, Klaus states. 
  "I am not opposed at all to its abolition," says Klaus, 
noting that the Czech Republic did not invent the old bloc. 
  "It is a technical matter which will be settled by finance 
ministers and governors of the national banks. It is not a task 
for premiers. This simply demands an instruction 'yes or not' 
from the top," he says. 
  The solution to the property relations (regarding the 
division of the former Czechoslovak property) is the most 
painful problem of the two countries' relations, Klaus says. "I 
fully respect that the Slovak Government does not have necessary 
mandate to resolve it before the elections," he adds. 
  In addition to this, there are some "extremely complicated 
border issues," which require "certain generosity, a detached 
view and a positive approach; the question is whether the 
government has it or not in view of its mandate," Klaus 
concludes. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 20 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
The right-left coalition after the autumn parliamentary 
elections is realistic and inevitable, KDH [Christian Democratic 
Movement] Chairman Jan Carnogursky tells SME. 
  "The current governing coalition is able to achieve 
pragmatic 
approach to problems and their solutions," he says, adding that 
if the mutual concessions inside coalition are compared, the 
interest of the government parties in preserving the coalition 
prevails. 
  "Sometimes abstract principles must be subordinated to 
practical needs if they are considered more important. We bear 
responsibility for the Slovak voters that the democratic Slovak 
Government will hold the autumn parliamentary elections," he 
stresses. In this connection he points to the effort of 
questioning the elections by means of destabilizing the current 
government to which the debates on the "lustration" (or 
screening law which lays down that members of the StB, the 
communist secret police, cannot hold senior public offices) law 
are directed. 
  He rejects the speculation that by refusing the principle of 
coalition and offering only places at its list of candidates to 
other groups the KDH would not want to head the anti-Meciar 
opposition. "The KDH was and is the backbone of opposition to 
Meciar," he stresses. "We just want to keep our own identity for 
the sake of the reformist forces in the next parliament," he 
adds. 
  "It is obvious that the Democratic Left Party (SDL), as the 
legal successor to the Slovak Communist Party, has other ideas 
about the reforms in society than, let us say, the KDH," 
Carnogursky says. However, the SDL can be, with some 
modifications, considered a reform party in Slovakia, he adds.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- The agreement on 
resolving the debt of the former Soviet Union which the Czech 
Republic signed recently with Russia included claims on behalf 
of Slovak companies, Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita 
[Schmognerova] told journalists before leaving for Moscow where 
she will discuss Russian debt with Vice-Premier Yuri Yarov. 
  Schmognerova said the Czech measure was the reason why the 
Slovak Government did not approve the Slovak-Russian agreement 
on former Soviet indebtedness during its Wednesday [22 June] 
session. 
  Schmognerova was to have signed the agreement, which the 
Russia Federation has provisionally approved, with Yarov on 
Thursday [23 June]. But now the Slovak Government needed to 
consult Prague first to "determine the scale of the debt claims 
which the Czech Republic made," she said. 
  Claims for Slovak companies had been included in the Czech- 
Russian agreement in the first place, she explained, because 
before Czechoslovakia split (on 1 January 1993) most 
Slovak-produced goods were exported via foreign trade companies 
based in the Czech Republic. 
  During her three-day stay in Moscow Schmognerova will sign 
an 
agreement preventing double taxation. 
  She said she would also use the visit to prepare further 
negotiations on the Russian debt agreement. "We have received 
the provisional consent of the Russian side. They are 
considering the results of their talks with the Czech Republic. 
Now it's necessary to persuade the Czech side that claims cannot 
be included accorded to domicile but instead according to place 
of manufacture," she said. 
  Slovakia is striving for inclusion of a clause whereby 
Russia 
would pay the interests on government loans in cash. 
Schmognerova said interest on a Czechoslovak loan granted to 
the USSR in June 1989 as well as on the 1990 foreign trade 
balance had not been paid in cash but in the form of supplies of 
military technology. 
  The Russian Federation has taken over about 1.5 billion 
dollars of Soviet debt towards Slovakia, from which 180 million 
dollars' worth has been paid in the form of military supplies. 
Further supplies of military spare parts worth 90 million 
dollars under negotiation have not yet materialized because the 
Slovak and Russian Governments have not agreed on precisely what 
parts should be included in the deal.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- A protocol on the 
exchange of goods and the provision of services in 1994 and an 
agreement on the support and protection of investments was 
signed by members of a visiting Ukrainian Government delegation 
and the Slovak Government. 
  The Ukrainian first deputy minister for external economic 
relations, Mikhail Reznik, said the trade between the two 
countries did not as yet correspond to the economic potential of 
the two countries. "The documents signed will make it easier for 
entrepreneurs to make trade contacts, and this will definitely 
show up in the volume of trade," he said. 
  More than 50 per cent of Ukrainian goods came to Slovakia 
via 
a third country, Reznik commented. 
  Last year the trade turnover between Slovakia and the 
Ukraine 
amounted to $280 million, which is more or less the level of 
previous years, Reznik said. 
  Ukraine wants to continue importing iron ore to Slovakia, 
and 
also sees a market for its chemical industry. From Slovakia it 
wants to import consumer goods. 
  The number of Ukrainian-Slovak joint enterprises is around 
120, Reznik said. Cooperation will be increased in the fields 
of engineering, the manufacture of vans and lorries, the mining 
and arms industries and agrocomplexes.

  [Text] Bratislava June 22 (CTK) -- Slovakia plans its 1995 
budget to have a deficit of 12 billion Slovak crowns, making up 
three percent of GDP, Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said after 
a cabinet session last night. 
  The cabinet approved a budget proposal for 1995, planning a 
15- percent unemployment rate, a two percent GDP growth and an 
eight percent inflation rate. 
  The cabinet asked the Finance Ministry to discuss the budget 
proposal with representatives of the central bank and of the 
National Property Fund (FNM). 
  Filkus said a problem was the amount of debt to be paid next 
year. Slovakia is expected to pay 38 to 44 billion Slovak 
crowns (about $1.3 billion), an increase by 11 to 17 billion 
crowns compared with this year. This increase is higher than 
the year-on-year growth in budget revenues and would draw a 
quarter of annual budget expenditures. 
  In case the central bank and the FNM refuse to share in 
paying back the debt, the budget deficit could not be 
maintained, Filkus added. 
  In an interview published by yesterday's issue of the 
economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Premier Jozef Moravcik said 
Slovakia's goal for this year was to completely halt the fall of 
GDP, reduce the inflation rate to 13 percent (from last year's 
23.1 percent) and maintain the budget deficit at 14 billion 
crowns.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 21 (CTK) -- Wage growth limits in 
1994 will be 10 percent for loss-making companies and 12 percent 
for profit-making companies, according to a resolution approved 
by the Slovak Government today. 
  During the first quarter, wages in loss-earning companies in 
Slovakia grew by 15.1 percent in comparison with the first 
quarter in 1993. As many as 2,900 firms with 25 or more 
employees had combined losses of ten billion crowns in the first 
quarter. 
  By holding down wages in profit-making firms the government 
is attempting to prevent wage increases in the financial, 
banking and insurance sphere.

  [Text] Bratislava June 21 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today supported a deputies' bill whereby political parties and 
movements can "spend" up to 12 million crowns ($400,000) in the 
autumn election campaign. 
  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said that, even if the bill 
is 
approved by parliament, "not all the financial means spent on 
the election campaign could be registered." Filkus told CTK 
that the law should enable control over political parties' 
expenditures in the course of the election campaign and after it. 
  According to the law, publishers of the periodical press as 
well as organisers of radio and television broadcasts and 
advertising companies' management would be obliged to provide 
the Finance Ministry and the Supreme Inspection Office with 
information about the amount of financial means individual 
political parties and coalition spent on the election campaign, 
Filkus said, adding that value added tax was included in the sum 
of 12 million crowns. 
  According to this year's financial management reports of 
individual political parties, the post-communist Democratic Left 
Party (SDL) with the 61.5 million crowns (some $2 million) worth 
of property is the richest political party in Slovakia followed 
by ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia (HZDS) with almost 21 million crowns and the Slovak 
National Party (SNS) with 8 million crowns.

  [Text] Pristina, June 22 (ATA) -- The framed trial against 
14 Albanians accused of being members of the "Ministry of 
Defence" of the Republic of Kosova continues in the Serbian 
court of Pristina. 
  The first two accused interrogated, Hajzer Hajzeraj, who 
before abolishment of Kosova's autonomy was deputy minister of 
the People's Defence and commander of the Civil Defence of 
Kosova, and Haxhi Ferati, magistrate of the People's Defence, 
turned down the accusations, saying that there is no "Ministry 
of Defence" of the Republic of Kosova and what is said in the 
charge is but slander. 
  The two accused said that they have been arrested and 
physically and mentally tortured by inspectors of the Serb state 
security in order to obtain statements through violence.

  [Excerpts] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- Today was the second 
day of the visit of Admiral William Owens, vice chairman of the 
U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. He visited the International Bank 
for Investment and Development and met with Foreign Minister 
Stanislav Daskalov, Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov, the 
leaders of the parliamentary National Security Committee and 
President Zhelyu Zhelev. The bilateral relations, Bulgaria's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative and the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia were the key issues on the 
agenda. Admiral Owens is visiting here at the invitation of the 
Defence Ministry and the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army. 
He delivered a lecture at the Atlantic Club. 
  President Zhelev elaborated on Bulgaria's position of 
non-interference in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia and 
non- participation in the peacekeeping forces there. It is 
skeptical about the participation of Turkish "blue helmets." 
There is transparency about Bulgaria's relations with its 
neighbours Greece and Turkey, the military sphere included, he 
said. In his opinion, however, Bulgaria is in a difficult 
position because of the lack of balance in the region, Greece 
and Turkey being much better armed. [passage omitted] 
  Defence Secretary William Perry will arrive here July 18, 
Admiral Owens said. 
  Mr. Daskalov familiarized Admiral Owens with the progress in 
the development of an individual cooperation programme and 
emphasized the significance that Bulgaria attributes to its 
long-term relations with NATO, Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko 
Vlaykov reported. They both praised UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Force] for preventing the expansion of the conflict. 
  Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov thanked for the chance 
given to Bulgarian officers to study in U.S. military schools. 
He said Bulgaria was hoping to have at least one battalion 
armed according to NATO standards, so that Bulgaria can take 
part in UN peacekeeping missions. 
  The leaders of the Parliamentary National Security Committee 
pointed out the political forces' consensus on Bulgaria's 
integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures, the 
parliamentary press office reported. They pointed out that 
Bulgaria needs more guarantees for its national security from 
its Western partners. 
  At the International Bank for Investment and Development 
Admiral Owens was familiarized with the progress of business 
contacts between Bulgarian and U.S. groups. This bank is the 
first Bulgarian-U.S. joint venture in the banking sphere in 
which the Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Parmont 
Capital Investments have equal shares.

  [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- Today parliament passed at 
second reading amendments to the Political and Civil 
Rehabilitation of the Victims of Repression Act, effective since 
June 29, 1991. Under the amendments, compensation claims will be 
filed at the Finance Ministry within five years from the coming 
into force of the act (instead of three years, as established 
previously). The amendment was prompted by the fact that many 
people failed to submit their claims within the set period 
because of organizational difficulties, i.e. inability to gather 
the required documents in time. The parliamentary Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) that has been boycotting parliament's 
work for a month now, took part in the debate and the vote. 
  The MP's continued to debate at second reading parts of the 
Commercial Code, regulating the state of insolvency (known also 
as the bankruptcy act). 
  At a meeting behind closed doors the Parliamentary Foreign 
Policy Committee adopted a stand on the memorandum of CE 
[Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly rapporteurs Domenique 
Coloumberg and Friedrich Koening on Bulgaria's adherence to the 
commitments made upon its admission to this organization. The 
two rapporteurs visited Bulgaria this April. All parliamentary 
forces supported the stand, except for those from the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) who walked out. Mr. Ivan Genov, MP of 
the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), told BTA's reporter that 
"the memorandum is excessively one- sided and represents only 
the attitude of the SDS, ignoring all other political forces." 
In his opinion, the committee's stand is intended to prevent 
the Council of Europe from interfering in internal political 
struggles. "Bulgaria strictly observes its commitments as 
member of the Council of Europe. There is political pluralism 
in this country, a freely elected parliament and a free press. 
The human rights are guaranteed. The committee understands 
that the transition naturally poses serious problems, but they 
do not call Bulgaria's commitments to the CE in question," runs 
the stand. The SDS representatives opposed it. "This is the 
first time someone dares accuse CE rapporteurs in partiality and 
prejudice," said MP Asparukh Panov. Later today the MP's of the 
SDS declared that the memorandum was objective and benevolent 
towards Bulgaria and to the difficulties it is facing in the 
period of transition to market economy. 
  At its meeting today, attended by representatives of the 
Defence Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and the Presidency, the 
Parliamentary National Security Committee approved a draft 
resolution on the participation of Bulgarian battleships in 
Turkish military exercises. The committee insists that the 
draft resolution be debated at a plenary sitting as soon as 
possible, as the two exercises begin July 4. The motion was 
made by the Council of Ministers. The committee heard experts' 
reports on different aspects of the document for Bulgaria's 
participation in the Partnership for Peace initiative. The 
document was approved by the Council of Ministers as a basis for 
negotiations with NATO.

  [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- The Council of Ministers 
today approved draft agreements on settlement of Bulgaria's 
commercial foreign debt and authorized Finance Minister Stoyan 
Aleksandrov to sign them. At the Boyana Residence on June 29, 
Mr. Aleksandrov will sign an agreement on exchange, an agreement 
on fiscal agency for front-loaded interest reduction bonds, an 
agreement on fiscal agency for collateralized discount bonds, an 
agreement on fiscal agency for past due interest rate bonds, and 
an agreement on collateral security. The documents will also be 
signed by officials of the closing agent, Deutsche Bank, and of 
the fiscal agent, Citibank. 
  The London Club banks will also sign the agreement within 
one 
month, after which it has to be ratified by the National 
Assembly, Mr. Aleksandrov told reporters. The document on 
finalization of the deal should be signed after the 
ratification, and then payments will start. 
  The agreement on exchange is the key one because it 
regulates 
an exchange of the creditor banks' receivables within the 
balance of debt of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank for 
government securities or discount options, said Deputy Finance 
Minister Dimitur Kostov. By this agreement the state takes over 
the obligations arising from the issue and servicing of the 
respective types of bonds. The agreement is made between 
Bulgaria and Deutsche Bank in its capacity as closing agent on 
behalf of the creditors. After this agreement is signed, a 
document-signing procedure will start with each commercial 
creditor bank which has declared that it will take part in the 
deal. 
  The agreements on fiscal agency for the different types of 
bonds define the bonds and Bulgaria's interrelations with the 
fiscal agent Citibank in connection with the servicing of the 
issues. 
  The agreement on collateral security defines the relations 
between Bulgaria and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 
connection with the institution and maintenance of the required 
security for the different types of bonds. 
  Bulgaria owes its London Club creditors some 8,000 million 
U.S. dollars, Mr. Kostov recalled. In addition, this country 
has a 2,000-2,500 million U.S. dollars outstanding debt to the 
Paris Club governments and a 1,500 million U.S. dollars debt to 
the international financial institutions. 
  Stoyan Aleksandrov said he had asked central bank officials 
to consider a strategy and take the necessary measures to 
prevent tensions on the currency market in connection with the 
finalization of the deal.

  [Text] Geneva, June 23 (BTA) -- The Deputy Prime Minister 
and Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Evgeni Matinchev met 
with the Director General of the International Organization for 
Migration [IOM], Mr. James Purcell, in Geneva and told him about 
the problems Bulgaria's Government is facing with migration: 
continuing economic emigration, migration of ethnic Turks, a 
large flow of passing migrants heading towards Western Europe, 
the presence of some 30-50 000 illegal aliens in Bulgaria and 
the ensuing problems in the labour market and occasional 
outbursts of xenophobia. 
  He said Bulgaria was hoping for IOM help to carry out the 
reform in migration legislation, to establish a computerized 
information system to follow the migration flow across the 
border checkpoints and to help ethnic Turks returning from 
Turkey and Bulgarians from Ukraine and Moldova who have moved to 
Bulgaria to become an integral part of Bulgarian society. 
  Mr. James Purcell said that IOM was willing to help Bulgaria 
solve its migration-related problems, reads a fax message of the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs received at BTA.

  [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- The cabinet today increased 
the prices of both imported and local solid fuel by a decree 
envisaging measures for the stabilization of the energy sector. 
Briquettes will cost 1,250 leva/tonne (about $22 at the current 
exchange rate), up from 660 leva/tonne, until October 1, when 
price ceilings will be introduced for solid fuels. 
  Other prices were fixed as follows: brown coal from 995 to 
1,116 leva/tonne; cleaned brown coal from 1,312 to 1,318 
leva/tonne; and lignite coal 632 to 809 leva/tonne. 
  The decree sets maximum mercantile additions for local coal 
at 210 leva/tonne; local briquettes 150 leva/tonne, and imported 
coal and briquettes 210 leva/tonne. 
  It was agreed that value added tax [VAT], introduced on 
April 
1, should not apply to fixed prices, Nikita Shervashidze, 
chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, said after the 
government meeting. That is why the government will allocate 
2,038 million leva to compensate the electricity supply industry 
for losses resulting from the imposition of VAT. In his view, 
this financial support is designed to tide the energy sector 
over until the introduction of prices and rate schedules that 
will allow it to become self-supporting. Power engineering 
companies estimate their losses at 2,000 million leva, while 
other sectors owe the energy sector some 14,000 million leva, 
according to statistics of the Power Engineering Committee. 
  Heating prices for industrial consumption were also 
increased. Suppliers can fix prices according to their 
production costs. 
  The decree envisages sanctions against managers of 
enterprises that are behind with their payments. They must pay 
their electricity and gas bills before wages are paid to 
employees. Those breaking the regulations will be fined up to 
10,000 leva. 
  No agreement was reached with the Finance Ministry on the 
enforcement of Council of Ministers' Decree No. 77, under which 
payments to the exchequer must precede the payment of wages. 
The finance minister and the chairman of the Power Engineering 
Committee were assigned to find mutually acceptable solutions. 
The introduction of new pricing methods in power engineering is 
the key to a lasting solution to its problems. Such a 
methodology has been drawn up and will be submitted to the 
government for approval. Shervashidze declined to cite new fuel 
and electricity prices. He said they would be formed along 
market economy principles, depending on the economic situation 
and the dollar exchange rate, but mechanisms to cushion the 
effect on low-income groups would also be introduced.

  [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- The right-orientated 
Democratic Union (DEU), which held its constituent congress at 
the weekend, wants to attract those Czechs who feel deceived or 
disappointed by the political development, DEU Chairwoman Alena 
Hromadkova told journalists today. 
  The ensuing reluctance to turn out at local and 
parliamentary 
elections is understandable, but it is incorrect and dangerous 
if political parties underestimate and downplay the problem, 
Hromadkova said. 
  As the DEU advocates the idea of constituting a law-abiding 
state, it considers the current situation in the sphere of 
Senate untenable, Milan Hulik, a DEU leader, said. If the 
Constitution laid down the Senate, the Senators should be 
elected, he added. 
  However, the Senate is substantiated only in the countries 
where it has a long tradition, which is not the case of the 
Czech Republic, Hulik said. "Although frequent changes in the 
constitution imply casting doubt on the legal state, the change 
in this case would mean a lesser evil," he added. 
  The bill ending restitution, which is being discussed now is 
a nonsense and the process of restitution should continue until 
its very end because it is the best and purest way of 
privatization, he said, adding that the same strategy should be 
applied in relation to the church property.

  [Text] Varnsdorf, North Bohemia, June 23 (CTK) -- Czech 
Premier and Chairman of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Vaclav 
Klaus said today he considered the newly-constituted Democratic 
Union (DEU) a "party of fundamental anti-Bolsheviks with no 
positive programme." 
  Addressing a public rally, Klaus said that the way of 
thinking of DEU members was close to what they themselves called 
"anti." "The DEU looks into the past and believes that this way 
leads somewhere," Klaus said. "The rear mirror of a car cannot 
be bigger than its front wind screen. I am afraid that 
Mrs.Hromadkova and people in her vicinity have not understood 
this at all," he said. 
  "We live in a democratic society where freedom of assembly 
and forming organizations is guaranteed and the appearance of 
such a party is thus natural," Klaus said. 
  The DEU, constituted on June 18, calls in its manifesto for 
barring former higher communist party officials, agents of the 
secret police (StB) and members of extremist parties and 
movements from civil service. The manifesto says that the DEU 
will seek the enactment of the non-proscription of the crimes of 
communism. 
  Alena Hromadkova, DEU chairwoman, is a sociologist and 
economist by education. She had never been a member of any 
party. She signed the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and was 
one of its spokeswomen in 1991. 
  At a press conference on June 23 Hromadkova said that the 
DEU 
wanted to attract to its ranks those Czechs who feel deceived or 
disappointed by political developments.

  The local election law says that towns with over 150,000

towns fail to state the exact number of counselors for the next 
term 85 days before the elections they are only allowed 35 
counselors. 
  The present council, which has 76 members, is yet to

  [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- Through its ill-considered 
decision to remove ten Russian MiG-29 planes from its equipment, 
the Czech Army has deprived itself of the most effective 
fighters, Michal Ambroz from the national committee of the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL) told CTK today. 
  "The Czech Republic now has practically no air strike force, 
because the remaining Su-29 planes are not equipped for 
fighting. These are certainly reasons arousing speculations 
about whether or not the Czech air force is still capable of any 
action," Ambroz said. 
  Today's issue of the independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES 
wrote that the decision to remove the MiGs had been made "in 
spite of the fact that these Russian planes are still considered 
in the world to be one of the best military aircraft." 
  "The Defense Ministry has said officially that it would be 
uneconomical to keep this kind of fighters, because their 
operation is too costly, while military experts say that the 
army wants to get rid of them, because it wants to replace them 
in the future with fighters bought somewhere else than in 
Russia," the paper writes. 
  It quotes Defense Minister Antonin Baudys as having said 
earlier that "the army is not interested in modernizing its 
equipment by supplies from countries with unstable policy."

  [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- The long-lasting dispute 
over local administration which was the central theme of debate 
in Wednesday's government session concerned whether there should 
be one or two levels of administrative body between the 
community and Parliament, Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Deputy 
Chairman Jan Strasky told journalists today. 
  "The dispute is over whether this state, which is smaller 
than it was under the Premyslids (kings from the 10th-13th 
centuries), smaller than it was in the time from when the models 
are being taken (when part of Czechoslovakia) should have a 
state administration consisting of a central body, regions, 
districts and communities," he said. Cost was another factor in 
the ODS' reluctance to have two levels between the community and 
state. 
  At issue was not the creation of an autonomous element (i.e. 
some decentralization of the state's power] but the level at 
which this ought to be created), Strasky said. 
  "It is clear to the ODS that the ideal number of autonomous 
units does not approach 100, or 80 - the number of districts 
today - but that it has to be smaller," he said. 
  He believed the ODS' coalition partners also admitted that 
there was not and would not in the near future be sufficient 
strength to get rid of any administrative body existing today. 
  If the government bill on higher units of local 
administration were passed in the form suggested by deputy 
premier Jan Kalvoda (ODS), this would mean setting up autonomous 
regions, and then districts which would probably not have the 
autonomy they now had, in addition to the communities and 
central organs. 
  The most important thing was to find a solution which would 
not shake the state administration and which would constitute a 
first step, for in the building of inner structures of the state 
there was never any final solution, Strasky said.

  [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- Over half of the Czech 
press is either owned or part-controlled by foreign concerns, 
the Czech daily DENNI TELEGRAF reports today. 
  The Swiss concern Ringier owns a Czech-based joint stock 
company of the same name which publishes the best-selling 
newspaper in the Czech Republic, the tabloid BLESK. Besides 
this it has a 51 percent stake in the daily LIDOVE NOVINY and 
the regional paper MORAVSKOSLEZSKY DEN. Among other media 
publications controlled by Ringier are the weekly RESPEKT, 
PRAGUE NEWS, TENIS REVUE, CESKOMORAVSKY PROFIT and TYDENIK 
TELEVIZE. 
  MLADA FRONTA DNES, the serious Czech daily with the widest 
circulation, is published by MaFra in which the French company 
Socpresse -- publishers of the French newspaper LE MONDE -- has 
a 48 percent stake. Socpresse additionally has stakes in five 
regional newspapers. 
  Most of the regional papers in the Czech Republic are 
controlled, however, by the Bavarian concern Passauer Neue 
Presse which, according to the DENNI TELEGRAF article, owns many 
Bavarian regional dailies which are close to the conservative 
CSU party. Passauer Neue Presse has a large stake in the Czech 
holding company Vltava Labe Press which publishes papers such as 
JIHOCESKE LISTY, SEVEROCESKE NOVINY, HRADECKE NOVINY, as well as 
the national magazines MLADY SVET and KVETY. 
  The agricultural daily ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY is 65 percent owned 
by the German Mittelrhein Verlag Bohemia, which also controls 86 
percent of the tabloid EXPRES. 
  A number of specialist economic publications are controlled 
by a concern called Euroexpanzion, created by Germany's 
Handelsblatt and the American Dow Jones company (which publishes 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL). Euroexpanzion owns 45 percent of 
Economica, the company which publishes the Czech economic daily 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, and the periodicals EKONOM and FINANCE. 
  Among Czech publications in which no foreign capital is 
involved are RUDE PRAVO, a left-leaning daily in which the 
editor-in-chief has the majority share, the right-leaning daily 
CESKY DENIK, DENNI TELEGRAF, which is owned by Investicni a 
Postovni Banka [Investment and Postal Bank] and PRACE, in which 
the trade unions have the majority share. The daily SVOBODNE 
SLOVO is published by the Melantrich publishing company, 97 
percent of shares in which belong to the Liberal National Social 
Party (LSNS). But the new law on political parties will oblige 
the LSNS to renounce its share and the daily will most likely be 
taken over by private individuals, DENNI TELEGRAF writes.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- The delegations of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) started what is presumed to be the last session of 
coalition talks in Budapest on Thursday. 
  The goal of the meeting is to appoint the members of the new 
cabinet and give the finishing touches to the coalition 
agreement. 
  The two sides are expected to sign the agreement on Friday, 
whereupon it will be presented to the MSZP's special congress 
and the SZDSZ deputies' conference for ratification this weekend.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 June (MTI) -- The parliamentary 
faction leaders of the six parties preparing the founding 
session of the new Parliament, to be convened on June 28, signed 
an agreement in Budapest on Thursday [23 June] to settle 
parliamentary posts, the composition of each committee, and the 
seating of the six parliamentary groups (delegated by the 
Hungarian Socialist Party, Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian 
Democratic People's Party, and the Federation of Young 
Democrats). 
  Karoly Szunyogh, the head of the President's Office, said 
the 
document is based on the country's interests and establishes all 
conditions of parliamentary democracy. 
  Secretary-General of Parliament Istvan Soltesz announced 
that 
a draft proposal will be completed by Monday [27 June], in which 
each parliamentary faction enlists who they wish to delegate to 
the committees. 
  Under the agreement, the Speaker of Parliament will be 
nominated by the faction that holds the majority of mandates, 
i.e. the Hungarian Socialist Party. The six groups suggest that 
the new Parliament elect three deputy speakers: from the 
Alliance of Free Democrats, the Hungarian Democratic Forum, and 
the Independent Smallholders' Party, respectively. 
  The new Parliament will have 17 committees: 13 permanent and 
four special ones. The Socialists will chair 9 committees, the 
Free Democrats three, and the four opposition parties will 
preside at five. 
  The four opposition parties of the new Parliament will get 
12 
deputy chairman posts on 17 committees, not nine, based on votes 
in the elections, not proportions of deputies. 
  Viewing the chamber from the Speaker of Parliament's pulpit, 
the six parliamentary groups will be seated from left to right: 
Hungarian Socialist Party, Alliance of Free Democrats, Hungarian 
Democratic Forum, Independent Smallholders' Party, Christian 
Democratic People's Party, and Federation of Young Democrats. 
The farthest section on the right-hand side will be left vacant. 
  Under the rules of Parliament, candidates for parliamentary 
posts are proposed by faction leaders, and the list of 
candidates is to be presented to the deputies by the chairman of 
seniority. 
  In the last part of the document, parliamentary group 
leaders 
fix that the agreement comes into force only if the Socialists 
and Free Democrats form a coalition, and lapses if they split up. 
  The June 28 founding session of the new Parliament will be 
opened by President Arpad Goncz, followed by Prime Minister 
Peter Boross's announcement of the ending of his cabinet's 
commission. But Boross and his ministers are to keep their 
offices until the establishment of the new government.

  [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- "The visit achieved our 
goals, this is as much as could be desired," Hungarian President 
Arpad Goncz said on Thursday, summing up the results of his 
three-day unofficial visit to the United States with Slovak 
President Michal Kovac. 
  The Hungarian president said the entire visit was 
characterized by a pleasant atmosphere, and can unequivocally be 
termed as useful for both Hungary and Slovakia. 
  The two presidents received honours from the New York-based 
Institute for East-West Studies, in recognition of their 
activity for international reconciliation. 
  "Thanks to splendid organization by the host institute, we 
had an opportunity both in Washington and in New York to meet 
with the political elite that shapes public opinion and 
participates in decision-making," Goncz said. 
  "The discussions created an opportunity for me to set forth 
issues through which I was able to clarify the recurring 
misunderstandings, including the one whereby Hungary, through 
its minority policy, is a trouble-maker and danger factor in 
Central Europe," the President said. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton received the Hungarian and 
Slovak 
Presidents at the White House. 
  On Thursday, Goncz and Kovac held a lecture in the morning, 
and attended an informal discussion at the Foreign Relations 
Council. The topics of the meeting were the more general Central 
European issues. 
  The Hungarian president will conclude his vist to the United 
States and leave New York for Budapest on Thursday evening.

  [Text] Warsaw, ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- Poland's Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Andrzej Olechowski, and Romania's Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Teodor Melescanu signed Thursday, 23 June, in 
Warsaw several documents regarding the cooperation between the 
two countries. They are two economic agreements: for the 
avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion, 
and, respectively, the mutual promotion and protection of 
investments. The sides also signed a cultural cooperation 
agreement and an accord of collaboration in foreign policy 
matters. 
  The two ministers shared the opinion that the documents 
signed today are apt to relaunch the bilateral relations, 
stagnant for some time.

parliamentary delegation, headed by the speaker of the 
Presidency of the People's Assembly, Pjeter Arbnori, was first 
received by the speaker of the Romanian House of Deputies, 
Adrian Nastase. 
  After describing the latest achievements in Albania, Mr. 
Arbnori said that: "We must closely cooperate with each other 
as countries emerging from the same bitter past and exchange 
experience in resolving problems with less pains." 
  Mr. Nastase said that cooperation should be intensified in 
parliamentary practices so that we adapt ourselves to the 
European standards in this field as soon as possible. Both 
parties devoted special importance to the increase of economic 
relations and trade exchanges between the two countries. 
  Mr. Arbnori and the delegation made up by Rudolf Marku, 
Servet Pellumbi, Ruzhdi Pulaha, and the chief of Press and 
Information of the People's Assembly, Visar Zhiti, also met with

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- "UDMR [Democratic 
Union of Hungarians in Romania] sees itself compelled to 
reassess the role and aim of its representation to parliament, 
because UDMR does not accept to act just as a stand-in in the 
country's legislative body," runs a statement made by this 
party's parliamentary group leader Gyula Vida at the end of the 
debates on the education act. 
  In the group's opinion, the "education act in its present 
form is absolutely unacceptable for the Hungarian community. It 
(the law) enacts an obvious and unspeakable discrimination 
against the ethnic minorities in Romania, and at the same time, 
a flagrant violation of the constitution." 
  The main objections UDMR has against the draft law is the 
restriction of the constitutional right to learn in the native 
tongue in all the objects of study, the abolition of the 
existing structures of specialized education in minority 
languages, the interdiction to train in higher education 
institutions specialists in social and economic sciences, the 
inacceptance to have the confessional schools reorganized and 
re-established. 
  "The ruling (Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR) is 
visibly the prisoner of extremist political forces. The 
government's lack of political will to solve these problems 
hampers the building of a climate of social peace, destabilizing 
the Romanian society," says the UDMR lower house group statement.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/06/1994 -- The parties 
grouped under the name of the Democratic Convention of Romania 
(CDR) and the Democratic Party (PD-FSN) have jointly forwarded a 
censure motion, Civic Alliance Party (PAC) President Nicolae 
Manolescu announced at his party's weekly newsbriefing. 
  He made it clear that, unlike other motions, the text of the 
present one no longer blames the government for economic 
mismanagement, but for the failure of having kept its promises. 
  "Very comprehensive" in contents, as the PAC leader 
described 
it, the fresh motion questions Mr. Vacaroiu's Cabinet's entire 
activity. 
  As for the censure motion of the Agrarian Democratic Party 
of 
Romania (PDAR), and the invitation issued to the opposition 
parties to join it, Nicolae Manolescu said the agrarians' 
decision came a little late, but he agreed that most of their 
objections were well grounded. As for the co-signing of the 
agrarians' censure motion, this is out of question, he said, 
because regulations allow for one signature along one 
parliamentary session.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- Romania does not 
hold chemical weapons and has not included in its research 
programme the manufacture of such weapons, said at the weekly 
meeting with the press the spokeswoman for the Ministry of 
National Defense Elena Olariu. 
  The question of whether or not Romania possesses chemical 
weapons was raised, she said, during National Defense Minister 
Gheorghe Tinca's visit to the United States as a consequence of 
confusing statements made on Romania's joining the Australia 
Group for the non-proliferation of the chemical weapons. 
  "We once again reiterate our previous statement and 
underline 
once more that Romania is ready to fulfill the conditions for 
the ban on chemical weapons," the Spokeswoman said. She also 
pointed out that the Romanian side invited through the Defense 
Minister Gheorghe Tinca a team of U.S. experts to visit all the 
chemical plants so as to dispel any doubts as to Romania's 
credibility in this respect. 
  Under the same topic the press was informed that an 
agreement 
was signed during Mr. Tinca's U.S. tour, laying the legal 
foundations of the cooperation between the Romanian and U.S. 
armies. The agreement outlines the main directions for the 
development of the military cooperation, the participation in 
the Partnership for Peace and the assessments on the stability 
and security in Central and Eastern Europe. 
  Mr. Tinca in his turn imparted on his American colleagues 
Romania's assessments of the stability in this area, informed 
them about the reform of the army, the training of the staff and 
the endowment with modern weaponry and equipment so that 
Romania's Army could be on a par with NATO standards. Mr. 
Tinca's opinion, the spokeswoman said, is that the relations 
between Romania and the United States in the military sphere are 
good and that there is the willingness to deepen them.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 23/6/1994 -- The Romanian press 
of the past days comments on the results of an opinion poll 
ordered by the government conducted by the Romanian Institute of 
Public Opinion Polling (IRSOP) in April 1994, and the results of 
which, however, being unfavorable for the government, are being 
kept strictly confidential. 
  According to the poll -- which carries the title National 
Study Regarding Public Perception of Current Social Issues, the 
Government's Eligibility for the People's Favors, and the 
Popularity of Parties and Their Top Politicians -- two thirds of 
the Romanians are not satisfied with President Ion Iliescu's 
performance and view him as not eligible for another mandate in 
office. More than 27 percent are stating in favor of Ion 
Iliescu, considering him still eligible for the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians are reproaching the president 
with 
not doing anything or doing too little to eliminate corruption 
(83 percent) and for agriculture (81 percent.) Two thirds are 
of the opinion that he does not encourage enough the market 
economy (67 percent) and is bringing a far too tiny contribution 
to the speeding up of privatization. Such opinions are, 
however, revealing that one part of the population has a wrong 
perception regarding the responsibilities of the presidential 
office. 
  Eight out of ten Romanians have a negative view on the 
government (79 percent). The negative views seem to be grounded 
more on the given impression of the government's lack of 
interest for the population, than on the lack of abilities in 
the performance of the executive. Only one out of four 
Romanians (23 percent) is accusing the government of lack of 
competence. With a smaller percentage, namely two out of ten 
Romanians (21 percent) are ready to praise the government and to 
find excuses for its failures, invoking an intervention by 
several forces sabotaging their good intentions. 
  The population's confidence in the political parties is 
pictured as follows: The ruling Social Democracy Party of 
Romania [PDSR] -- 21 percent; the National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] (opposition) -- 17 percent; 
the Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania [PDAR] (backer of the 
government until recently) -- 8 percent; the Civic Alliance 
Party [PAC] (opposition) - 8 percent; the Democratic Party [PD] 
(opposition) -- 6 percent; the National Romanian Unity Party 
[PUNR] (government backer) -- 6 percent; the Romanian Ecologist 
Party [PER] -- 6 percent; the Liberal Party '93 [PL-93] -- 5 
percent; the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [UDMR] -- 
5 percent (all opposition forces); the Socialist Party of Labor 
[PSM] -- 4 percent; the Greater Romania Party [PRM] -- 4 percent 
(both government backers); and the Romanian Social-Democratic 
Party [PSDR] -- 1 percent (opposition.) 
  The circumstances under which the poll was leaked to the 
press are still unknown, because its orderer, the Government's 
General Secretariat, did not make an official release of the 
document, while the executive has neither denied nor confirmed 
speculations of the press.

  [Text] Moscow, June 23 (CTK) -- The agreement with Russia 
on the former Soviet Union's debt to Slovakia could be signed on 
Friday even though the Slovak Government rejected it this week, 
Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova said today. 
  The problem of debt towards Slovak companies still needs to 
be resolved but the Slovak side agrees with all other points in 
the agreement, she said after her talks with vice-premiers of 
the Russian Federation Oleg Soskovec and Yuriy Yarov. 
  Slovakia would like to include at least a provisional 
estimate of the Russian debt to Slovak companies in the 
protocol, while the definitive sum could be specified later, 
said Schmognerova, who began a two-day visit to Moscow today. 
If no agreement was reached, she added, a new round of talks 
would have to be prepared on the condition that the contentious 
issue with the Czech Republic were resolved. 
  Originally it was expected that the agreement on Russia's 
share of the Soviet debt towards Slovakia, which is estimated at 
$1.3 million, would be signed during Schmognerova's Moscow 
visit. The Slovak Government, however, failed to approve the 
document on Wednesday because, as Schmognerova explained, debt 
claims raised by Slovak companies had been included in the 
agreement the Czech Republic recently signed with Russia. 
  Claims for Slovak companies were included in the 
Czech-Russian agreement because before Czechoslovakia split (on 
1 January 1993) most Slovak-produced goods were exported via 
foreign trade companies based in the Czech Republic, 
Schmognerova said yesterday before leaving for Moscow. 
  Czech Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik has said the figure put 
on the Russian debt in the agreement was only a guide and would 
be specified later. 
  The Czech agreement stipulates a debt of $3.5 billion which 
the Russian Federation is to take over from the former Soviet 
Union and to repay by 2003. Around $1.5 billion of this sum is 
due to Slovakia. $180 million worth of this has already been 
paid to Slovakia in the form of military supplies. Further 
supplies of military spare parts worth $90 million under 
negotiation have not yet materialized because the Slovak and 
Russian Governments have not agreed on precisely what parts 
should be included in the deal.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- The National Democratic 
Party (NDS) Executive Committee, at its meeting today, expressed 
full support for Slovak Privatization Minister Milan Janicina, 
an NDS member. 
  An NDS statement given to CTK says that the growing attacks 
on the minister, who is also NDS deputy chairman, from the 
Democratic Left Party (SDL), an NDS coalition partner, were 
unjustified and contradicted the ethics of coalition cooperation. 
  Statements by SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, Chairman of the SDL 
deputies' group Milan Ftacnik and some other deputies about 
Janicina's giving unjustified preference to the coupon method of 
privatization compared with other methods are not qualified and 
substantiated, the statement says. 
  The NDS considers it "natural and moral that citizens, 
through coupon privatization, receive their share in the 
property which they have been creating in the past," the 
statement says. The NDS Executive Committee believes that "the 
coalition government will meet its commitments and offer 
citizens property worth at least 88 billion Slovak crowns (some 
3 billion USD)," it adds. 
  Following unsuccessful attempts by the opposition Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) to dismiss Janicina there have 
been calls for a change of privatization minister. It is 
primarily the coalition SDL which raises objections towards 
Janicina's performance. There has long been speculation about 
controversies between Janicina and Economy Minister Petr Magvasi 
concerning the concept of privatization.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- Parliamentary democracy 
in Slovakia has shown it is viable, and this is the most 
important experience from the first hundred days of existence of 
the broad coalition government which replaced that of ex-premier 
Vladimir Meciar in March, Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik told 
journalists today. 
  He added that Slovakia did not need a greater concentration 
of power in the form of a presidential system. 
  The most burning problem with which the cabinet had to deal 
was the condition of the state budget, Moravcik said. He 
rejected "the transferring of problems into the future" by 
increased borrowing, saying that in addition to saving money 
taxes had to be raised. 
  Talking about the results of his government's work, he 
emphasized preparations for the acceleration of privatization, 
support to small and medium-sized businesses and Slovakia's 
increased credibility abroad, even though investors "were 
waiting tensely for the results of the autumn elections." He 
admitted that the government had not managed to deal with the 
insolvency of state companies, and the practical functioning of 
the screening law also remained an unanswered question. 
  Deputy premier Ivan Simko said that during its one hundred 
days the government had given 43 bills to parliament, most of 
which dealt with crime, the situation in the state 
administration, the restoration of purity to political life and 
bringing Slovak law closer to the requirements of the European 
Union. 
  Asked whether Slovakia remained a legal state even without 
the screening law being respected, Simko said that due to 
unclear competence after the division of Czechoslovakia several 
laws could not be put into practice. "We cannot observe the 
screening law, because no organ exists to give out 
certificates," Nonetheless, he admitted that the solution of 
this technical question had come up against the political 
problem of disagreement between the Democratic Left Party (SDL) 
and the coalition. Unlike the premier, however, Simko considers 
it possible to find a way out of the problem by the elections. 
Dialogue and the attempt to find a compromise could ensure that 
the present coalition continued to exist after the elections. 
  Moravcik also said that the differences of opinion between 
the post-communist SDL and the rest of the coalition with regard 
to privatization methods "do not concern ideas," and that 
agreement had been reached as to the extent of coupon 
privatization. 
  "People's security has become the number one political 
problem," Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said. Between the 
beginning of the year and the end of May,the percentage of all 
crimes solved had risen from 28.3 to 38.5 per cent, with the 
success rate for solving economic crimes having almost doubled, 
going from 40 per cent to nearly 80. The result was that people 
had more confidence in the police, even though crime was on the 
increase and drug abuse spreading, and the revelation of police 
corruption remained a problem. 
  Moravcik confirmed that he would probably meet Czech Premier 
Vaclav Klaus unofficially at the Central European Initiative 
meeting in Trieste. However, he believed that some of the 
problems between the Czech and Slovak republics would remain 
unsolved. Although he rejected opposition pressure to increase 
further protectionist measures, and admitted that "the partisan 
method of introducing the imports surcharge is not a good 
solution," nonetheless Bratislava had managed to "smooth away" 
displeasure from GATT and the imports surcharge would remain in 
effect until the end of the year.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik considers the division of Czechoslovakia only 
temporary, because it is probable, in his opinion, that both new 
republics will become members of the European Union before the 
end of the century, and will resume very close contact. 
  The Premier told journalists today that apart from the 
Slovak 
National Party (SNP), no political organization in the last 
federal elections had as part of its platform the division of 
the country, and more than half the citizens of Slovakia were 
against it. 
  The former Czechoslovakia, however, was based on "Communist 
federalism," and relations between the two peoples did not 
develop on a healthy basis, in the opinion of the Slovak 
Premier. He said this was why the Slovak side tried in its 
mutual relations to use the model of the European Union, which 
"did not gain acceptance, but which certainly well, and on an 
historical scale." 
  The division, according to Moravcik, was a compromise aimed 
at resolving the dilemma of how to break out of a permanent 
situation of crisis, which was sinking ever deeper into 
discussions about the optimal form of shared existence. "We were 
unable to decide on any other variant," Moravcik said. For 
Slovakia, in his view, the acceptability of the split lay 
precisely in the fact that "from the standpoint of the future, 
nothing really would change." 
  "I was the first member of the federal government to foresee 
that Czechoslovakia would cease to exist at the end of 1992," 
Moravcik emphasized, and added that he had himself voted for the 
breakup of the state. Making no attempt to deny the importance 
of the "national identity" of the Slovaks, he said that from the 
position of his former post he had often discussed the 
preservation of the Czechoslovak state with international 
institutions, but with the condition that the Czech and Slovak 
Republics participate in European structures on an independent 
basis. 
  "National identity is a value which it is necessary to watch 
over, integration is something else," he said. The fact that 
"both republics will belong to the greater European society is 
not at odds with the principle of national identity. It is the 
resolution of relations between peoples in a European manner," 
Moravcik stated. 
  "We had to explain to the world why Czechoslovakia is 
splitting up," he said. He considers the fact that it succeeded 
a very important factor in the present acceptance of both 
republics, but especially of Slovakia.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
  The prize of the Institute for East-West Studies (IEWS) 
jointly awarded to the Slovak and Hungarian presidents, Michal 
Kovac and Arpad Goncz, is, in fact, an open call for the two 
countries' responsible politicians to start dealing at last with 
the idea of a historical compromise, the independent NARODNA 
OBRODA says. 
  "Kovac and Goncz are actually only symbolic proponents and 
creators of this objectively inevitable process although symbols 
are irreplaceable and very necessary," the daily notes. 
  Realistic people on both banks of the Danube River are fully 
aware that what had happened between French and Germans or 
Austrians and Italians must happen between Slovaks and 
Hungarians as well, the paper states. 
  Afterwards, the Slovak-Hungarian compromise could serve as a 
model for the rest of the postcommunist world, including 
Hungary's other neighbors. "It is in Slovaks' and Hungarians' 
own interest not to postpone the process," the daily adds. 
  "The framework has been created, there is willingness and 
courage. If the process is halted, or something worse occurs, 
the present and future generations could curse their fathers and 
grand- fathers for not having used the offered historical 
chance. And it is here, indeed," the paper concludes.

  [Text] Bratislava June 23 (CTK) -- Only representatives of 
the Permanent Conference of the Civic Institute (SKOI) will be 
placed at the list of candidates of the KDH (Christian 
Democratic Movement), KDH Chairman Jan Carnogursky said after 
the last round of talks about the KDH slate today. 
  The leading figure of the SKOI is former Czechoslovak 
Interior Minister Jan Langos. 
  The governing KDH (18 deputies in the 150-seat Slovak 
parliament and 8-10 percent in polls) had conducted talks with 
several right- wing and centrist parties about their possible 
joint slate. 
  "It was not possible to wait any longer," Carnogursky said 
about the National Democratic Party (NDS) whose representatives 
showed interest in the KDH slate in early June. However, two 
weeks ago, they received a similar offer from Premier Jozef 
Moravcik's Democratic Union (DU) and stopped the talks with the 
Christian democrats. 
  The final version of the KDH slate will be approved on July 
9, Carnogursky reported. 
  The elections will be held on September 30-October 1.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
will approve an agreement on the support and mutual protection 
of investments with the Czech Republic [CR] in the near future, 
Slovak Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus told CTK today. 
  He said the agreement could be signed before the autumn 
elections, to be held on September 30 and October 1. 
  "We have prepared almost 30 agreements of a similar 
character, not only with the Czech Republic, and we are 
interested in bringing them quickly into effect," Filkus said. 
  The Czech Government approved the agreement on the mutual 
support of investments on Wednesday [22 June]. Czech Finance 
Minister Ivan Kocarnik said the text of the agreement had been 
discussed with the Slovak side, which had agreed with it. The 
text of the agreement proceeds from the fact that the 
contractual parties are states which formerly composed a 
federation. 
  The agreement, which was discussed before the Czechoslovak 
Federation split (on 1 January 1993), never came into effect 
because it was never debated by the Czech parliament nor 
ratified by the Czech president, Kocarnik said.

  [Text] Pisino -- Yesterday the Croatian regime endeavored 
to celebrate the Anti-Fascist Struggle Day, thus attempting to 
convince the world that the Croatian people, and therefore 
present-day Croatia, also made a major contribution toward 
overthrowing Nazism and Fascism. However, in his celebratory 
speech held in Pisino, in the heart of Istria, Croatian 
President Tudjman did not resist the temptation to fire point 
blank on Italy, the Italian minority in Istria, and Istrian 
autonomist aspirations. 
  Speaking of the Italian minority in Croatia, Tudjman said 
that most of its members had collaborated with the Fascist 
regime, although he acknowledged that some Italians had joined 
the struggle waged by the partisan forces which, however, had 
been led from Croatian territory. 
  He did not say a word about native Italians or the Istrian 
exodus, but added another threatening, retaliatory sentence: 
"Democratic Croatia favors cooperation with a democratic Italy, 
and will respect the rights of the Italian ethnic group in 
accordance with international conventions, but we request the 
same rights to be recognized for the Croatian minority in Italy, 
from Trieste to Molise, a minority which is larger than the 
Italian minority in Istria."

  [Text] Tirana, June 23 (ATA) -- Also on the second day of 
the census in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], 
Albanians did not accept to take part in the census because the 
minimum indispensable conditions for a normal and unbiased 
development of this process have not been met. 
  Internal sources report that in the great centres inhabited 
by Albanians, the latter have not taken part in the census, 
except for the Macedonians. 
  The chairman of the representatives of the Geneva Council, 
Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said at a press conference in Skopje 
that lack of nationality, the main concern of the Albanians of 
that republic, should not prevent them from taking part in the 
census, because this is an act which will not verify the 
Macedonian nationality. According to Mr. Ahrens, persons who 
have not been granted the nationality but have the old identity 
card before 1993 may take part in the census. 
  In the meantime, none of the senior Macedonian authorities 
made any public statement to confirm this. 
  The Party for Democratic for Prosperity [PDP] branches in 
towns with Albanian population in western Macedonia continue to 
receive various complaints on obstacles encountered by the 
Albanians to be included in the census process within schedule. 
  The deputy chairwoman of the PDP centred in Tetove, Nexhibe 
Palloshi, and the chairman of this party's branch in Skopje, 
Adem Hyseni, told ATA that in Tetove, Skopje, and its suburbs, 
over 50 percent of the Albanians have so far been unable to 
receive the nationality document. 
  In the course of finding compromising facts on the 
manipulation of the census and denigration of the Albanians, 
they said that among the persons of Albanian origin who have 
made the request for nationality since 1993, more than 2,000 
have their documents "lost" in the labyrinths of the Macedonian 
administration. 
  The interior minister of Macedonia, Lubomir Frckovski, 
stated 
earlier that the nationality status for 98 percent of the 
population is guaranteed, but the chairman of the PDP, Arben 
Xhaferi, in reply to his statement, says that perhaps, Frckovski 
had said this bearing in mind only the Macedonian population of 
this republic. 
  Although the number of the Albanian officers in the 
Macedonia 
Army is extremely small, only 63 out of 3,700, who are 
Macedonians, many of them have not yet been able to receive the 
nationality document, while they are the defenders of the 
territorial integrity of this republic. The same is also 
happening with many youths of Albanian nationality who carry out 
military service in the Macedonian Army. 
  The second day of census in Tetove, Gostivar, Skopje, 
Struge, 
Kumanove, Kercove, and Diber closed without the participation in 
the census of the Albanians who demand reexamination of the law, 
which they consider disfavouring and of deliberate aims for 
political manipulation.

  [Text] [Announcer] At today's hearing of the trial of the 
last Albanian communist president, Ramiz Alia, and nine top 
party and state officials of the communist regime, the court 
heard their defense counsels' summing up and the final 
statements by the defendants. Reporter Marash Mirashi was 
present in court for Albanian Television: 
  [Mirashi] [20-second audio outage] and gave his own 
explanations. After affirming the innocence of Manush Myftiu, 
he asked the court to reach its verdict, just as Prosecutor Fana 
had, in his summing up, in calling for a five-year suspended 
sentence. 
  Riza Icka, defense counsel for Adil Carcani, said 
practically 
the same thing. 
  Kleanthi Koci, defending former President Alia, 
characterized 
Alia's trial as unconstitutional and called for his total 
acquittal. 
  Meanwhile, Ilir Selenica, defense counsel for Rita Marko, 
called for a not-guilty verdict for his client. He stressed 
that the summing up had presented a malicious view of Marko. 
The prosecutor had demanded a 10-year prison sentence for 
Marko, while on almost the same charges, a five-year suspended 
sentence had been demanded for Carcani and Myftiu. In his final 
statement, the defendant Marko said essentially the same. 
  Analysts consider such cases as clear contradictions. 
  Roland Permeti, defense counsel for Simon Stefani, asked the 
court to find his client not guilty, based on the arguments that 
he had presented to the court. 
  A six-year sentence for Hekuran Isai would be very harsh, 
his 
attorney Selenica said. The charges against him are built on 
exaggerated statements that do not hold water. 
  Arben Vane, defense counsel for Aranit Cela, said that it 
was 
impossible for a lawyer such as Cela to have committed deeds 
that ran contrary to the law. He requested that a not-guilty 
verdict be passed for this defendant. 
  Attorneys Luan Behri, Arqile Lole, and Vladimir Bineri also 
requested not-guilty verdicts for defendants Zylyftar Ramizi, 
Rrapi Mino, and Veiz Haderi. 
  Chairman of the Court Celiku then asked to hear the final 
statements of the defendants. 
  The last communist president, Alia, stressed that the 
charges 
were a result of state pressure. He then converted his final 
statement into a political speech, similar to those of 1990-91, 
but this time without any applause from his devotees. 
  Defendant Simon Stefani submitted his final statement in 
writing to the court. Then the other defendants, Isai, Ramizi, 
Mino, Cela, and Haderi, spoke, all demanding to be acquitted. 
  At the end, the court withdrew to consider the verdict, 
which 
will be announced at the next hearing at 1700 [1500 GMT] on 
Tuesday 28 June.

<F P=106> [Second installment of summary of the program of the </F>
Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania; date not given] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  The Policy of the Right-Wing Democratic Party of Albania </H5>
[PDDSH] on the Functioning of the Juridical State 
  The PDDSH is for a complete functioning of the juridical 
state. The PDDSH stresses that, since the fall of the 
dictatorial regime, the role of the state has been to protect 
and coordinate the interests of the individual with those of 
society. In the post- dictatorial period, a powerful and 
rigorous state is needed to implement laws and defend the rights 
of citizens guaranteed by the Constitution. 
  For the juridical state to function better, the PDDSH will 
strive to implement the following measures: 
  1. To restore law and order by waging a bitter struggle 
against criminals (theft, violation, drugs, prostitution, and 
hooliganism). In order to achieve this, extensive powers will be 
granted to the law and order forces to impose extremely severe 
sanctions against dereliction of duty. 
  2. To determine the official status of state employees by 
giving them necessary powers to perform their duties, decent pay 
according to their functions, and legal protection. Criteria to 
be met by state employees will also be defined, giving priority 
to honesty, professionalism, and the strict implementation of 
state laws. 
  3. For a better functioning of the legal state, a profound 
reform in the justice system is necessary. Existing legislation 
should be amended to include judgments by people's juries. Work 
will be also be carried out to purge judicial groups of people 
who, in the past, have participated in political trials or, 
during the transition period, have compromised themselves while 
carrying out their duties. 
  A profound reform in the law and order forces and the army 
will be carried out in order to make these bodies serve the 
juridical state with allegiance. 
  4. The PDSSH will firmly struggle against corruption, 
speculations, and favoritism at all levels. It will persevere 
with extremely severe lawful measures to discover and punish 
such cases. 
  Within this framework, a major overhaul of the customs-duty 
system, financial policy, tariff offices, forestry policy, state 
inspectorates of electricity, health services, etc. will be 
carried out. 
  5. To fully implement these laws, the PDDSH will insist that 
the legislation on urban area development be further improved 
and put into practice by guaranteeing buildings and other 
construction sites in conformity with technical discipline and 
approved plans. 
  6. The PDDSH supports a parliamentary republic where the 
three powers -- legislative, executive, and juridical -- are led 
along the fulfillment of rights set out in the Constitution. 
The PDDSH is, at the same time, in favor of a popular 
referendum on the form of regime to be established. 
  7. The PDDSH is for a secular state where religion is 
separate from the state. The PDDSH honors the rights of Muslim, 
Orthodox, and Catholic believers to freely observe their 
religious endeavors. 
  The PDDSH will resolutely circumvent any religious sect in 
their attempt to capitalize on citizens' religious convictions, 
national interests, or democratic principles defined by the 
Constitution. 
  Thee PDDSH underscores that it will resolutely fight for the 
Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania. The PDDSH decidedly 
declares itself against foreign prelates of various ranks 
overseeing religious organizations in Albania. 
  8. The PDDSH will make all necessary efforts to secure full 
equality among citizens, regardless of race, religion, sex, or 
political views. 
  9. The PDDSH is for a better coordination of power between 
central and local government bodies. 
<H5>  The PDDSH's policy on the National Question </H5>
  1. The PDDSH will pursue its foreign policy entirely along 
the fulfillment and protection of aspirations, the rights and 
interests of the Albanian nation as a whole, and the Albanian 
state. 
  2. The PDDSH proclaims as its benevolent ideal the struggle 
for the resolution of the Albanian national question -- that is, 
the unification of all detached parts of the Albanian nation and 
ethnic territories based on the Albanian nation's right to 
self-determination in accordance with the Law of Nations. 
  3. The PDDSH is opposed to all kinds of malicious 
propaganda, 
domestic and external, by the speculative name of "Great 
Albania," and it is definitely in favor of the ethnic Albania as 
a national state for all Albanians as a factor for peace and 
stability in the Balkans. 
  4. All efforts by the PDDSH reagrding foreign policy will 
serve the fulfillment of the Albanian nation's aspirations for 
unity. It will not accept any general or partial solution aimed 
at denying legitimate endeavors for unity. 
  5. The PDDSH is against any tendencies, political trends, or 
Albanian political forces that tend to present the Albanian 
national question as a facultative task for the Albanians, thus 
trying to replace nationalism with cosmopolitanism. 
  6. The PDDSH will strive to unite all the patriotic forces 
of 
the Albanian nation in the ethnic Albanian lands and diaspora in 
order to serve the cause of national unification. It will 
repudiate all kinds of political forces or elements who try to 
bring into question the Albanian nation's right to and 
capability for unification or manifest their tendencies to 
conclude agreements or cooperate with foreign powers to the 
detirment of the Albanian national question. 
<H5>  PDDSH Foreign Policy </H5>
  1. In its relations with other countries, the PDDSH will 
pursue a serious, realistic, entirely nationalist, and open 
policy that firmly relies on the lessons that history has taught 
us, without preconceptions, or a complex of inferiority toward 
others, opposing unilateral concessions that are not based on 
the principles of mutual benefit and justice. 
  2. The PDDSH will strive to build and develop the Albanian 
state's international relations on sound and safe foundations in 
reasonable ways, in accordance with our country's real 
possilibities, and the attitude of other states and nations 
toward the Albanian nation and state. 
  3. Albania as a state and nation should decently take its 
place in Europe next to the other nations and states. 
Nationalism should not be considered as an obstacle to 
Albania's integration into Europe but rather a necessity for the 
united Albanian nation to take its place in united Europe 
without any discrimination. 
  4. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania, as an European 
country, maintains broad and cordial relations with other 
countries and regions of the world, especially those countries 
with which it has maintained ancient traditional links, 
spiritual and cultural affinity, and common interests and 
principles. 
  5. The PDDSH is in favor of close state relations, 
particularly those states and nations that are historically or 
actually inclined to be close friends and allies of Albania, as 
well as other countries and nations that show signs of goodwill 
toward us. The PDDSH will never aim to fuel and foment 
hostility toward any other nation or state, be it big or small, 
near or far away. What the PDSH wants is only good 
understanding, friendship, and useful cooperation. 
  6. The PDDSH will always be ready to develop close and 
thorough relations of good neighborliness in the Balkans and 
Adriactic region. It is of the opinion that relations with 
Italy and Turkey are fruitful and neighborly. Possiblities are 
increasing for relations with Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and 
Slovenia. Relations can also be developed with nearby countries 
bordering on the Albanian nation, like Greece, Serbia, Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia], and Montenegro, 
depending on the stand that those states maintain toward the 
Albanian nation's legitimate rights of the Albanian nation and 
toward the Republic of Kosovo. The PDDSH will always bear in 
mind that good-neighborly relations with those states will 
depend on the policy pursued by their governments. 
  7. The PDDSH is in favor of Albania's absolute relationship 
with Kosovo as two states belonging to one and the same religion 
and having the same political and diplomatic tasks to fulfill in 
the field of foreign policy and international relations. The 
policy of the Republic of Albania will powerfully and without 
any reservations support the recognition of independence and 
sovereignty of the Republic of Kosovo as a transitory period 
toward national union. The PDDSH will oppose all kinds of 
diplomatic plans that try to impose upon the Albanian nation in 
Kosovo any narrow politico-juridical, state, or 
juridico-international status that is contrary to the political 
will already expressed by their votes in the referendum on the 
occasion of the proclamation of the Republic of Kosovo and the 
elections held in Kosovo. The PDDSH will resolutely struggle to 
see that Albanians in Macedonia and Montenegro freely and 
without hindrance are able to exercise their rights until the 
ultimate resolution of the Albanian national question is 
accomplished. The PDDSH will strive that the [word indistinct] 
population return to their hearths and their property [in 
northwestern Greece] taken by force, enjoying their rights as an 
inseparable part of the Albanian nation. 
  8. The PDDSH desires and will attempt to maintain the 
Albanian state's close and fruitful relations friendly nations 
and countries like Austria, Germany, and Hungary, great 
democratic powers like the United States, Europe's civilized and 
developed countries, and Arab and all other countries. 
  9. The PDDSH supports the participation of Albania in 
universal organizations, important international bodies, and 
organizations of regional character. The PDDSH attaches 
importance to the participation of the Albanian state through 
relevant bodies in activities of cooperation and understanding 
in the Balkans, the Adriatic Sea, Europe, the Mediterranean and 
Black Sea, in the Conference of the Islamic Countries, and in 
other bodies that might be set up in the future. 
  10. The PDDSH proposes that the Albanian state set up a 
diplomatic service of genuine national physiognomy, spirit, and 
professional qualification that is capable of properly 
performing its duties toward their nation and serving the cause 
of the Albanian national question and its long-term mission. 
  11. The PDDSH will always be ready to coordinate efforts and 
actions and discuss them with all Albanian political forces that 
are sincerely in favor of a genuine foreign and national policy 
on the part of the Albanian state on the international policy 
front. However, the PDDSH will resolutely reject and repudiate 
any compromise that might undermine and impair the resolution of 
the Albanian national question, sacrifice the rights and 
interests of our brothers in their ethnically occupied 
territories, or damage the sovereignty and dignity of the 
Albanian nation and state. 
  12. The PDDSH will strive to see that Albania and the 
Albanians earn the world's sympathy and respect, thus achieving 
a good understanding but not pleading for them. It will oppose 
all practices of various states or international bodies that try 
to bring Albania under a certain degree of foreign political and 
juridical tutelage.

<F P=106> ["Special statement" by President Zhelyu Zhelev on his </F>
decision to sign Law on Amendments to the Privatization Act -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Today President Zhelyu Zhelev signed Decree No. 
141, with which he ordered that the Law on Amendments and 
Additions to the Act on Conversion and Privatization of State 
and Municipal Enterprises should be published in DURZHAVEN 
VESTNIK. In this connection, he made the following special 
statement for Bulgarian National Radio and Television: 
  [Zhelev] I signed the Privatization Act because it is one of 
the most important, not to say fateful, laws for our country's 
development. Before deciding to sign the law, I held a broad 
series of meetings and talks with experts and economists from 
various institutions and circles with the aim of hearing their 
views. As a result of the talks and the views that I was able 
to hear, I understood that they have various objections to the 
content of the law itself, although as a whole most of them 
support mass privatization. 
  I also have such objections, I also have my own reservations 
regarding this law, but despite this I decided to let it pass, 
to sign it, because otherwise there is a danger of us stopping 
altogether one of the most important aspects of the reforms. 
Whereas the Restitution of Property Act affected about 3 or 4 
percent of the population, and the Law on Return of Farmland 
affected about 70 percent of the nation, this law affects 
practically every single one of us. In my view, the mass 
privatization act, as it is popularly called, is important 
because of the following. First, it launches, it provides a 
powerful stimulus -- if it is properly applied -- to 
privatization in general, which in Bulgaria is almost at a 
standstill. Second, it creates a new, far wider social basis. 
Such an important law cannot operate effectively unless it is 
supported by practically the entire nation. For this to happen, 
one needs mass privatization that attracts the interest of the 
people. Third, none of the Eastern European countries that are 
moving along the same path were able to manage without the 
instrument of mass privatization. In Czechia, Poland, Hungary, 
Slovakia, and Russia, although the different countries achieved 
varying rates of success, all of them in one way or another used 
mass privatization as a means to intensify this process and 
impart a strong impulse to it. 
  In practice, I found myself in the situation, despite my 
reservations, of having to sign this law. However, for it to be 
a truly effective law, to prevent it proving another dead 
letter, in my opinion parliament must pass as a matter of 
urgency the bills on insolvencies and on investment funds, and 
also carefully consider the question whether the banks could not 
also be used in the role of investment funds. Second, in the 
subsidiary legislative and normative documents to the act, it is 
essential to differentiate very clearly and precisely the 
functions and role of the mass privatization center and the 
Privatization Agency, to ensure that the mass privatization in 
no way hampers the other forms of market privatization. Last, 
but not least, we need a strong government that has the will, 
energy, and courage to carry out the privatization. The law 
itself, however perfect it may be, cannot achieve anything. 
  Accordingly, I had to choose between signing a not 
completely 
perfect law on mass privatization and the prospect of Bulgaria 
not having any mass privatization at all. I prefered to sign.

  [Text] The parliamentary group of the Union of Democratic 
Forces [SDS] decided on its own judgment to infringe the 
parliamentary boycott because of the bill on amending the Law on 
Rehabilitation Victims of Repressions. Stefan Savov, the 
group's chairman, told our reporter Antoaneta Puncheva that when 
a decision -- he clearly had the boycott in mind -- proves to be 
wrong, it has to revoked. 
  Savov has not received any official reaction from the SDS 
National Coordinating Council to the parliamentary group's 
decision, which was reached yesterday. The coalition's 
political organ will discuss the decision at its meeting on 
Tuesday [28 June]. Stefan Savov also denied the rumor that he 
is supposed to become prime minister during the term of the 
present parliament, implying he will be prime minister of a 
caretaker cabinet. I have a big party behind me, he said; I am 
not the kind of politician fit to serve in a caretaker cabinet.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladislav Stoychev on today's session of National </F>
Assembly in Sofia -- live] 
  [Excerpt] First, a sensational piece of news: National 
Assembly Deputy Veselina Rasheeva has resigned from the 
chairmanship of the commission popularly known as the Clean Past 
Commission, which answers to the Union of Democratic Forces 
[SDS] National Coordinating Council. The commission is 
responsible for carrying out Paragraph 4 of the decision of the 
Sixth SDS National Conference, aimed at uncovering former 
members of the BCP [Bulgarian Communist Party], leading members 
of the BCP nomenklatura, and members of the Active Fighters 
Against Fascism Union who have found their way into the SDS 
structures. 
  Ms. Rasheeva's reasons for her resignation are that the 
National Coordinating Council is disregarding the commission's 
recommendations and, moreover, an instruction has been issued in 
the council's name that the "clean past" Paragraph 4 should be 
implemented selectively. Ms. Rasheeva will continue to serve as 
a member of the commission. [passage omitted]

Sofia. Representatives of working collectives from the pits in 
Maritsa- Iztok, Troyanovo-1, -2, and -3, the briquette factory 
in Gulubovo, and mines in Pernik, Bobovdol, and elsewhere. The 
miners put forward demands for protecting the national 
coal-mining industry and the drafting of a clear concept for its 
future development. They also demanded the immediate restarting 
of the briquette factory in Gulubovo, which provides fuel for 
more than 2,000 families, and the exemption of its production 
from value added tax, which makes it output unsalable. 
  According to a press release issued by the Council of 
Ministers Press Center, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov and Nikita 
Shervashidze, chairman of the Committee on Power Supply, met 
with representatives of the striking coal miners and power 
industry workers. On behalf of the strikers, the 
representatives handed Prof. Berov a declaration containing 
their demands. The strikers' representatives were briefed on 
the measures adopted today by the government to ensure the 
financial stabilization of the energy industry until the 
introduction of a mechanism for periodically updating the prices 
of energy products.

<F P=106> [Interview with Stanislav Devaty, director of the Security </F>
and Information Service, by Jan Bednar; place and date not 
given: "Intelligence Services Should Be Controlled by the 
Government and Parliament"] 
  [Text] Parliamentary committees last week debated the 
government bill on the Security and Information Service (BIS) 
and also an "umbrella" law on all intelligence services of the 
Czech Republic. The existing law on BIS is valid until the end 
of the first half of this year, and, therefore, a new law has to 
be adopted. We have asked interim BIS Director Stanislav Devaty, 
who defended the bill in parliament, to what extent the new laws 
will be of benefit to the work of intelligence services. 
  [Devaty] Parliament has decided that the system of 
intelligence services should be regulated by a law. This law 
should apply to all intelligence services because, until now, we 
have had a comprehensive law on BIS only. Parliament has 
decided that a new concept for intelligence services will be 
created. New special regulations for each service should be 
built on this concept. Ours has been drafted. Of course, it is 
difficult to invent something new in the sphere of intelligence 
services, but we have drafted this bill using our own experience 
and foreign experience. 
  [Bednar] According to the bill, the government wants to take 
over the control of intelligence services, apart from giving 
them assignments. Have you not been satisfied with the existing 
way of control? 
  [Devaty] I have said it about a hundred times: I am not 
against control at all. On the contrary, I welcome any kind of 
control. In principle, I am only against control bodies having 
access to open cases. We have a sort of gentleman's agreement 
with the control body: I am willing to let them have access to 
any operation any time, but such an operation must be closed 
first. The problem is that our responsibility should be 
balanced. That is, if I open records on something, I must have 
a very good reason for it. One cannot have access to an 
operation in progress without having a reason or just because 
someone says so. Someone must bear responsibility for the 
operation being stopped. Deputies must be aware of the fact 
that it may have serious consequences if, having access to our 
work, they prevent a certain operation from continuing. 
  [Bednar] Has full responsibility been transferred to the 
government whose task is to control you, then? 
  [Devaty] Control should be divided between the government 
and parliament. As long as the government is to be responsible 
for the activity of the [intelligence] services, it also has to 
have a chance of controlling this service in some way. This is 
logical. Now, we have to find a balance between the government's 
interference in the work of the [intelligence] services and 
parliament's access to their activity. 
  [Bednar] Does it trouble you that you have not been 
appointed BIS director permanently? 
  [Devaty] To be sincere, it does bother me quite a lot, not 
so much because of myself but because it means, in fact, 
permanent "uncertainty within the firm." In view of the fact 
that I have already been two years with BIS, that this "firm" 
has developed in a certain way, and that we even implemented a 
certain concept, I believe that it does not much contribute to 
the security of the people who are employed there if no 
permanent director has been appointed. Before me, there were 
seven directors there. Such changes are not to the benefit of 
the service, in the same way that they would not be to the 
benefit of any other organization. 
  [Bednar] Does this obstruct reconstruction of the service? 
  [Devaty] We are trying to eliminate the influence of this 
fact on the reconstruction of the service, but we can feel that 
people are insecure. Each director brings his own ideas, and 
this means certain changes to the intelligence service, a shock. 
The intelligence service has been through so many shocks it 
needs a period of peace, in my opinion. We already have arrived 
at a certain model, and now we need at least two years of peace 
to be able to develop our activity. 
  [Bednar] Why has the decision on the director still not been 
made? 
  [Devaty] I do not know. The government, as well as 
parliament, have their say in the matter--still according to the 
old law. The fact is that I have been appointed precisely 
according to the law. I was proposed by the government at that 
time, the appropriate parliamentary committee discussed the 
proposal, and I was appointed by the Czech National Council 
Presidium. Unfortunately, they used the word "interim." Why 
this still is the case, I do not know.

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Prchal: "Czech Transformation </F>
Experiences Are Attracting Interest in Economic Relations"] 
  [Text] Czech experiences of successful and rapid economic 
transformation are attracting interest in developing economic 
and commercial cooperation with our country. This was confirmed 
by the series of meetings held by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus 
and Ministers Ivan Kocarnik and Karel Dyba at the end of last 
week, during the international economic forum in the Swiss town 
of Crans-Montana. 
  Economy Minister Karel Dyba described his exchange of views 
with Vietnamese representatives as very friendly. "Vietnam, 
which will obviously be the next `tiger' in Southeast Asia, with 
a market of almost 100 million inhabitants, is an enormously 
interesting country for all industrially advanced states. There 
is an uninterrupted flow of Taiwanese and Japanese businessmen 
who are making their way there. The Vietnamese officials 
emphasized our longstanding cooperation, and I had the feeling 
from our talks that they would be happy for it to continue," he 
told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. In reply to a question from 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on whether the Czech Republic has a chance of 
asserting itself there, in a situation where various advanced 
states are now investing heavily in his country, the secretary 
general of the Vietnamese Council for Foreign Trade, Nguyen 
Trung [name as published], said: "Absolutely certainly. Our 
economic relations have a good tradition, and the prospects for 
our cooperation, even after the recent turbulent years, are 
promising. Our two countries have distinct comparative 
advantages. We have a very cheap labor force, and your 
technology, because of its low cost compared with Western 
states, is capable of competing solidly. Together we can 
produce high quality products, and, given our lower overheads, 
we can assert ourselves well on world markets." 
  Following his talks with his Croatian counterpart, Nikica 
Valentic, V. Klaus said that Croatia is immensely interested in 
expanding economic relations with the Czech Republic, especially 
in increasing the exchange of goods. "This country returns a 
number of positive results, which, irrespective of the state of 
war in the region, indicate that the situation there is 
consolidating," he added. Prime Minister Nikica Valentic 
expressed his conviction that this year's anticipated invasion 
of Czech tourists in Croatia will certainly have a favorable 
influence on the development of economic relations with the 
Czech Republic. 
  Apropos his talks with Ukrainian Economy Minister Roman 
Shpek, Minister K. Dyba told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that they mainly 
discussed the possibilities for capitalizing our outstanding 
claims and for our entry into the privatization process in 
Ukraine. The Ukrainian representative promised to provide our 
government with a data base of the enterprises that are open as 
shareholding companies for the entry of foreign investors. 
"This could be an interesting offer for some of our large 
companies, although there are certain risks there that anyone 
interested in investing must weigh. There was obvious interest 
from the Ukrainian side," he stated. In an interview for 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY, Shpek expressed his hope that our economic 
and commercial relations will flourish and that their volume 
will increase. According to him, "it is true, obviously, of all 
countries transferring to a market economy that, during the 
first phase, they break off their economic relations with their 
former partners and strive to assert themselves on Western 
markets. We are also seeking good fortune in the West, but, 
even so, during the course of reform, we should take advantage 
of the fact that there used to be traditional cooperation 
between us on various levels, including the enterprise level, 
and we should base it on mutual advantageousness and 
productivity. Ukraine and the Czech Republic, for example, 
cooperated well in engineering and the metallurgical industry. 
Your technology for the consumer industry had a large market in 
our country. I think that words like `East' and `West' should 
not be decisive in trade; after all, the important thing is its 
advantageousness." 
  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus held meetings in Crans-Montana 
with leading representatives from some of the countries of the 
former Soviet Union--Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and Belarus. He 
said: "It is remarkable that these countries see a model for 
themselves in the reform path along which the Czech Republic is 
going. We even reached a firm agreement on sending to Moldova 
and Georgia a mission of our experts who will give advice there 
on the whole logic of the transformation process." He added 
that he received an official request for this from the Moldovan 
president and the Georgian prime minister. "I think it can only 
be in our interest to make use of it," said V. Klaus.

<F P=106> [Article by Vaclav Lavicka: "Hungarian Businessmen Would </F>
Very Much Like To Expand Their Marketing Possibilities, Even in 
the Czech Republic"] 
  [Text] Between 24 and 29 May, more than 30 firms from 
the northern Hungarian region of Nograd will introduce 
themselves at Prague's U Hybernu Palace. The project is 
supported by the Budapest Ministry for Foreign Economic 
Contacts. 
  Recently, Hungary has been attempting to revive commercial 
flow among Central European countries and, of course, to find 
new markets. The fact that Hungarian manufacturers have 
something to offer could be verified by several Czech 
journalists in recent days. Their journey led them not to 
Budapest but, rather, to northern Hungarian rural areas, 
specifically to the region of Nograd, which borders the Slovak 
Republic. 
  The region, with its 230,000 inhabitants, is one of the 
smallest in the Hungarian Republic. Its center is at 
Salgotarjan, which has a population of approximately 50,000. "We 
are greatly interested in having Hungarian and Czech businessmen 
get to know each other better and establishing mutually 
beneficial contacts. That is why we have decided to introduce 
our region, our firms, and their products in Prague," stated 
Ferenc Korill, chairman of the General Assembly for the region 
of Nograd, during a news conference. 
  Neither he nor any other officials from the region and 
representatives of local firms there, who met with Czech 
journalists, made a secret of the fact that the economy of the 
region is currently wasting away. The extraction of brown coal 
has been halted, and metallurgy and steelmaking (which was, at 
one time, the backbone of the regional economy) are in deep 
crisis because they were oriented toward a single principal 
market. Unemployment in the region affects more than 20 percent 
of all jobs (the national average is 12.2 percent). 
  Agriculture in the region has outstanding natural 
conditions, 
primarily for the raising of fruit, vegetables, and potatoes. 
Other developmental opportunities are provided by the riches of 
the forests, and there are even possibilities for tourism. But, 
much as is the case elsewhere, there is a lack of investments, 
not only for modernizing production, but also for investments in 
the weak infrastructure (the highway network, communications, 
sources of potable water, the ecology). 
  "Foreign investors are not exactly rushing into the crisis 
regions in Hungary. I would say that their interests end at the 
Danube River--in other words, primarily in western Hungary," 
noted F. Korill. In his estimation, the region receives about 1 
percent of all foreign investments placed in Hungary (toward the 
end of 1992, the region received 4 billion forints). 
  Prague will be visited from the Nograd region not only by 
firms that have already traded with Czech partners, but also by 
those who have thus far "cultivated" no foreign contacts. Of 
course, the region also has firms (which have been fully or 
partially privatized) that already have the worst behind 
them--some have even highly successfully penetrated into western 
markets. They would very much like to try it in the Czech 
Republic. 
  The presentation by Hungarian firms from the region that is 
economically wasting away but that has not resigned itself to 
this fate enjoys official support: The Budapest Ministry for 
Foreign Economic Contacts has allocated 7.5 million forints for 
this purpose. 
  Let us add that, in the Prague U Hybernu Palace and the 
Hungarian Cultural Center in Prague, not only will firms and 
their products be introduced, but also folk art from the region, 
its rich history, and examples of its contemporary social life.

<F P=106> [Article by vac: "Last Year, the Decline in the Gross </F>
Domestic Product Was Halted"] 
  [Text] According to the expectations and estimates of the 
most important economists, including even members of the 
Economic Council of Ministers, the decline in the gross domestic 
product [GDP] stopped in 1993. When compared with 1992, it 
reached the level of 99.7 percent--that is to say, it was 0.3 
percent lower. HOSPODARSKE NOVINY has already reported on these 
fundamental preliminary data issued by the Czech Statistical 
Office. In more detailed materials, the Czech Statistical Office 
notes that the figures for 1992 and 1993 have been rendered 
extensively more accurate. According to these materials, the GDP 
for 1993 attained a value of 923.1 billion korunas [Kc]--that 
is, approximately Kc89,400 per capita. Other facts that were 
reported regarding these computations by the statistical 
authorities are also of interest. The implicit deflator (the 
cumulative price index) of the GDP attained a level of 115.3 
points. For purposes of comparison, it is possible to state that 
the measure of inflation, computed on the basis of the consumer 
price index (a sliding average for 12 months compared with the 
same period a year ago), reached a 1993 level of 120.8 percent. 
  From the standpoint of aggregate demand, the slight decline 
in the GDP was brought about by the gross creation of fixed 
capital (by declining by 7.9 percent), whereas all other 
components increased: Consumption by households increased by 1.5 
percent and consumption by the government by 1.1 percent, and 
the asset portion of the foreign trade balance rose 44 percent. 
A decline in inventories and reserves (approximately 6 percent 
of the total volume of the GDP) in 1993 was approximately equal 
to the level of 1992. 
  There was a more express rise in some expenditure components 
of the GDP (computed in current prices). The share of household 
consumption rose from 51.5 percent in 1992 to 54.2 percent in 
1993, government consumption increased from 23.1 percent to 25.7 
percent, and the positive balance of foreign trade rose from 1.2 
percent to 3.1 percent. On the other hand, there was a decline 
in the share accounted for by gross capital formation from 24.7 
percent to 23.3 percent. There was a specific increase in the 
share of inventory and reserve decline, which dropped from 
- 0.7 percent to - 6.3 percent.

<F P=106> [Article based on announcement at news conference by </F>
Jindrich Vodicka, minister of labor and social affairs: "Toward 
the End of the Year, Social Security Payments Will Rise"] 
  [Text] Prague--An increase in social security 
transfers, including pensions, is being readied by the Ministry 
of Labor and Social Affairs. This adjustment should come about 
during the fourth quarter of this year. At yesterday's news 
conference, this was announced by Minister Jindrich Vodicka. 
  Measures being readied for families with children will have 
to do with adjustment of the additional payments for children 
(the ministry anticipates an increase of between 40 and 50 
korunas [Kc] a month), adjustments in the state equalization 
contribution for foster children (it will rise approximately by 
Kc200 for a family operating within the one-and-one-half and 
double multiple of the minimum living costs in terms of their 
income). The adjustment figures on increasing support payments 
for the birth of a child (by Kc500) and on increasing the 
parental contribution. The ministry is also proposing increasing 
burial payments by approximately Kc2,000; adjusting the 
contribution for wives and children of soldiers (by 
approximately Kc100); the contribution toward the expenses for 
quarters for a soldier (by approximately 10 percent); and 
payments supporting alimentation and other basic requirements of 
citizens who depend on catering services (by approximately 
Kc100). 
  The above amounts are still to be discussed by the 
government. But the minister was not expecting any fundamental 
changes in the amounts he proposes. He is also proposing the 
valorization of pensions, which should also come about in the 
fourth quarter but will most likely occur a month later. The 
valorization is to be made up of two portions according to the 
proposal. The state equalization contribution is to be valorized 
first, which means that all pensioners would receive an 
additional payment of Kc220. Next, pensions are to be increased 
by 5 percent. On average, pensions should rise by Kc360, which, 
according to Minister Vodicka, represents a 12-percent rise in 
pensions.

<F P=106> [TA SR Washington dispatch: "Arpad Goncz and Michal Kovac </F>
Want To Contribute to Building Good-Neighborly Relations"] 
  [Text] Washington--"We have managed to introduce a certain 
calm into society in Slovakia. The government has started to 
work systematically and more conceptually, without regard for 
the fact that its mandate expires by the time of the elections 
in September," Slovak President Michal Kovac told the TA SR 
correspondent after his arrival in Washington. 
  He said that the first five months of the year indicate a 
certain economic growth, even though this phenomenon could be 
only temporary. An agreement with the IMF has been reached, and 
an agreement with the World Bank is in the offing, which bears 
out that the experts of these institutions have become convinced 
that the internal political stability is positively reflected 
also in the government's economic work. 
  Commenting on the intensification of relations between 
Slovakia and the United States, Michal Kovac said that he 
perceives them within the framework of the U.S. interest in the 
Central European region [sentence as published]. According to 
the president, the increased domestic stability in Slovakia also 
contributes to this because it was precisely after the change in 
government that a number of important bilateral visits were 
realized. 
  "I see the Institute for East-West Studies [IEWS] prize as a 
token of appreciation from an important international 
institution for the fact that the Slovak president, aside from 
dealing with various domestic political problems, initiated a 
dialogue with representatives of the Hungarian minority and 
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz," President Kovac told the TA SR 
correspondent. 
  "It is a token of appreciation for not only my policy but 
also the policy of all of the political forces that currently 
seek the establishment of good, friendly relations between 
Hungary and Slovakia. I am thinking also of the present 
coalition government, which has already taken a number of 
accommodating steps in this direction," Kovac said. 
  The president went on to say that, together with Hungarian 
President Arpad Goncz, they realize the great importance of 
achieving historical reconciliation between Hungary and 
Slovakia. "As long as we hold our present posts, we will do 
everything within our power so that Hungarian-Slovak relations 
become relations between two good, friendly neighbors," the 
Slovak president stressed.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 
22 June on pages 1 and 2 carries a 900-word interview with 
Jaroslav Svechota, former deputy minister of interior, by Julius 
Gembicky entitled "Jaroslav Svechota: I Do Not Own a Firm That 
Would Shadow Politicians for Vladimir Meciar." In the 
interview, which was held in a Bratislava cafe on 21 June, 
Svechota responds to an interview given by Ludovit Cernak, 
deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic 
and chairman of the National Democratic Party, to the 17 June 
issue of the East Slovak regional daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, 
claiming that a private firm run by Svechota was acting as an 
"information and intelligence agency" for former Prime Minister 
Meciar. 
  In the interview, Svechota asserts that he does not know 
anything about the existence of such a firm. He tells the 
interviewer that he is a partner in only two private firms, one 
"dealing with agricultural production on restituted land in the 
Dunajska Streda district" and the other a building firm, which, 
however, "does not engage in any activity and does not have even 
one koruna of turnover or profit." Asked how the suspicion of 
his involvement in such a firm could arise, Svechota says: "It 
may have its origin in Czech dailies, where a report appeared 
that I was behind Vladimir Meciar's intelligence service. It is 
a fabrication. I am engaged in neither intelligence nor 
shadowing people." Svechota also denies that he has engaged in 
any such activity at any time since leaving the Ministry of 
Interior. 
  Asked about Cernak's possible motives for his assertions in 
the SLOVENSKY VYCHOD interview, Svechota says: "We could find a 
reply to this if we analyzed Mr. Cernak's contacts and 
ascertained from where he might have such findings. But I 
really do not know what his motives are." Pressed by the 
interviewer to say what he means by Cernak's "contacts," 
Svechota then says: "I would not want to go into detail." 
  In conclusion, Svechota announces that he is going to sue 
both the publisher of SLOVENSKY VYCHOD and Cernak.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Moravcik Expects the Present Coalition To Be </F>
Victorious in the Elections"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--One hundred days before the elections, 
Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is confident that the 
coalition parties making up the present government will be 
victorious. "We must convince our people that it is possible to 
govern without Meciar in Slovakia," the acting Slovak prime 
minister told the Austrian APA agency in an interview. 
  According to Moravcik, the evolution of the political 
orientation of citizens in Slovakia has not yet ended. "It is 
deplorable that as much as 30 percent of Slovakia's population 
still leans toward parties with extremist tendencies. Although 
there is not much time left before the extraordinary elections, 
I suppose that many of these citizens could still be persuaded 
not to vote for the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) or 
the Slovak National Party (SNS). At any rate, Meciar's HZDS 
should not emerge from the fall elections victorious. In the 
event of an electoral fiasco of his party, Meciar would perhaps 
leave the Slovak political stage forever because he is not the 
type of politician who would be ready or able to wait four years 
for his next chance." 
  In the economic sphere, the Slovak prime minister reckons 
that there will soon be an increase of taxes. He hopes, 
however, that the citizens of Slovakia will have understanding 
for these government measures, all the more so because his 
Cabinet is planning to raise pensions in the interest of 
alleviating the social consequences [of the tax hikes].

<F P=106> [Article by Ondrej Dostal: "A Well-Balanced Sheet"] </F>
  [Text] The results of the public opinion survey that the 
FOCUS agency carried out in May register, among other things, 
the population's views on selected problems that are 
illustrative of attitudes on the right-center-left scale. 
  A total of 7.1 percent of respondents identified themselves 
clearly as being on the left, 14.9 percent as leaning toward the 
left, 44.1 percent as leaning toward the center, 13.1 percent as 
leaning toward the right, and 6.7 percent as being clearly on 
the right. What is evident, apart from the numerical equality 
between "right-wingers" and "left-wingers," is the clear 
dominance of those who profess allegiance to the political 
center. However, this position in the center does not have the 
character of consistent and unambiguous centrist positions but, 
rather, is a combination of right-wing and left-wing attitudes. 
  In relation to the general economic transformation, 
proreform 
attitudes and approaches that can be considered right-wing have 
a surprisingly strong representation. As many as 45.9 percent 
of respondents are of the opinion that the pace of the economic 
reform should be faster, and 25.3 percent consider its pace 
adequate. On the other hand, 13.7 percent advocate the slowing 
down of the reform, and only 2.3 percent want the reform to be 
halted. More than one-half of respondents (52.8 percent) agree 
with the privatization of the largest possible number of 
companies, while 35.3 percent are of the opposite opinion. 
  Those polled in the FOCUS survey expressed a relatively 
favorable attitude toward private entrepreneurs--41.3 percent 
advocate a reduction of the entrepreneurs' tax burden, compared 
with 17.7 percent who would like to see their tax burden rise. 
The opinion that companies and firms should be given the 
opportunity to give a part of their taxes directly in support of 
health care, education, culture, sports, and the like is 
supported by 60.6 percent of those polled, while only 21.1 
percent want taxes to be surrendered exclusively directly into 
the state budget. Views on the terms of the payment of 
unemployment benefits reveal a similar pattern--59.9 percent 
want them to be tightened, while 14.8 percent want them to be 
less stringent. 
  On some other questions (and it needs to be said that these 
questions have a more immediate impact on the respondents' 
lives), views gravitate more toward the center. For example, 
41.2 percent advocate the existence of a single type of health 
and social insurance for everyone, while approximately the same 
number (41.4 percent) prefer the possibility to choose from 
various types of health and social insurance according to one's 
own choice and level of income. The view that the state should 
provide child allowances regardless of the level of parents' 
income is supported by 40.3 percent; 26.7 percent believe that 
they should be paid only to families living at the subsistence 
level, while 30.5 percent are somewhere in between these two 
options. 
  However, all of the previous seemingly protransformation 
figures are called in question somewhat by the fact that as many 
as 47.2 percent disagree with the view that the changes in the 
economy must be made as quickly as possible, even at the cost of 
temporarily lowering living standards. On the other hand, 45 
percent agree with this view. Given the erstwhile massive shock 
over "belt-tightening," this division into two almost equally 
strong halves is not all that tragic, however. 
  The most extreme antireform attitudes appear at the most 
general level. As many as 67.8 percent believe that income 
differentials should be reduced, with which only 27.9 percent 
disagree. As many as 82.8 percent agree with the view that 
people in our country are growing rich predominantly by 
dishonest means, as against 14.6 percent who disagree with this 
view. 
  On the other hand, also positive tendencies are to be 
observed at the rather general plane, which cannot be quite 
unequivocally assessed in terms of right-wing or left-wing 
attitudes. The view that Slovakia should follow as much as 
possible the example of the advanced countries of the West is 
supported by 66.6 percent, while only 25.9 percent voiced 
disagreement with this view. 
  On the whole, the sheet is thus well-balanced.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Unemployment Declined in May; in Eleven </F>
Districts, One in Five People Is Jobless"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--The decline in the number of 
unemployed, which began this February, continued in May. At the 
end of May, labor offices had on record 354,000 job seekers, 
7,063 fewer than the month before. The unemployment rate was 
13.89 percent and was 0.28 percentage points lower than at the 
end of April. In 11 districts of the Slovak Republic, the rate 
of unemployment exceeded 20 percent, and, in another 11 
districts, it was higher than 15 percent. According to data 
provided by the Employment Services Administration, the rate of 
unemployment declined in all districts of the Slovak Republic, 
with the exception of Nitra, Martin, Rimavska Sobota, Velky 
Krtis, and Kosice-Environs. 
  The Bratislava City (4.09 percent), Kosice-City (9.67 
percent), and Trencin (7.07 percent) districts continue to have 
the lowest rate of unemployment. The highest rate of 
unemployment remains in the districts of Rimavska Sobota (26.10 
percent), Kosice-Environs (22.75 percent), and Spisska Nova Ves 
(22.23 percent). The relatively most marked decrease of 
unemployment was registered in May in the districts of Cadca, 
Trencin, Bardejov, and Svidnik. 
  Labor offices in the Slovak Republic newly registered 20,568 
job seekers in May and crossed off the names of 27,631 persons 
from their registers, 6,707 of whom (24.3 percent) were placed 
through the mediation of labor offices. There were 35 job 
seekers for each vacant job at the end of May. The development 
of unemployment is favorably influenced by the seasonal factor: 
The number of job opportunities in agriculture, construction, 
and tourism goes up during the summer.

<F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the </F>
Hungarian Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not 
given: "Today Is a Decisive Day for the Coalition"] 
  [Text] No one has won and no one has been defeated. With 
the guarantee agreement, we have drawn up a solution that allows 
us to make joint decisions, to govern jointly, and to share 
responsibility, Imre Szekeres said among other things. 
  [Szombathy] At the coalition talks on 20 June, agreements 
were reached that were characterized by both sides as progress. 
What are your views on these coalition agreements? 
  [Szekeres] In my view, the agreement on the governmental 
structure is a conditional agreement. Some questions on the 
governmental positions and structure have remained open, and it 
depends on these questions whether the agreement of 20 June will 
remain in force. We have achieved agreements on certain points 
but the final agreement can only be interpreted within the 
complete package. The open issues will be decided at the 
meeting on 22 June. We suggest that we agree on the members of 
the new government, their tasks, and what kind of ministries we 
will have, and we should also settle the issue of national 
authorities, bodies, and offices. In my view, the governmental 
structure and the issue of positions is the less important, 
organizational side of the whole coalition agreement. The 
government program itself is much more important and it will be 
discussed today for the first time. I think it is a mistake 
that the government program has not been at the forefront of 
talks up to now. Society is more interested in the government's 
goals and ideas than in the bargaining mechanism of the 
partners. Therefore, the essence of the coalition talks will 
come on the agenda on 22 June, in other words, this is the 
decisive day in my view. 
  [Szombathy] The full government structure was revealed on 20 
June. What else can be open issues? 
  [Szekeres] Although we have only left two or three points 
open, the whole agreement will only be valid when these are also 
settled. The fate and operation of the offices dealing with the 
country's internal security have not yet been clarified. We 
have not yet decided, either, what role the county-level 
governments should have in the regional governmental structure, 
which is another important issue of power sharing. These issues 
have a serious effect on the agreement on the Interior 
Ministry's operation. 
  [Szombathy] Observers appreciated the SZDSZ's success in the 
guarantee agreement and that the MSZP gained positions in the 
government structure. What is your view on this agreement? 
  [Szekeres] I do not agree with either statements because the 
observers were not able to look into the process of 
negotiations. No one has won and no one has been defeated. With 
the guarantee agreement, we formed a solution on the basis of 
which we will make joint decisions, govern jointly, and share 
responsibility. Other models would also have been possible, but 
we decided on this one. We have lifted the coalition 
coordination council out of the governmental structure because 
it does not legally fit into the government's work. Time will 
tell whether this model of operation is correct. No one has won 
in the allocation of governmental positions, either, because it 
is obvious that the various ministries have different effect on 
the country's life. The distribution of positions is not a 
purely quantitative, mathematical issue. The SZDSZ has acquired 
reasonable positions in areas that have significant influence on 
the country's life. However, the obligation of coordination 
also applies to the SZDSZ's ministries. 
  [Szombathy] Yesterday, both the SZDSZ and the MSZP were 
preparing for the talks on 22 June. What did the Socialist 
delegation agree on? 
  [Szekeres] We reviewed the materials of the special 
committees and tried to harmonize the differences. I met the 
MSZP's county chairmen and we drew up the schedule to follow the 
completion of the coalition agreement. On 24 June, we will look 
at the coalition agreement at the meeting of the national board 
of directors, and a proposal will be made on the parliamentary 
group's leadership. At the 25 June meeting of the national 
committee, the parliamentary group will also express its 
preliminary opinion on the agreement. We will choose the 
parliamentary group's leadership and delegate members to the 
parliamentary committees at this meeting. We will hold a 
ratifying congress on 26 June. 
  [Szombathy] Can debates be expected on the coalition 
agreement? 
  [Szekeres] I expect a clarifying congress, and we will 
definitely have debates. The only question that we can ask is 
whether the congress will accept or reject the agreement. In 
the MSZP and among our electors, many people have been 
expressing their reservations regarding the coalition agreement. 
The worries can be dispelled when they learn about the details 
of the talks. 
  [Szombathy] Your name has also been mentioned as 
parliamentary group leader for the MSZP. If you are elected, 
would you resign as executive chairman? 
  [Szekeres] No. If I am nominated to head the parliamentary 
group then I will occupy both positions until our congress in 
October. We wish to renew the party's entire leadership in 
October but, until then, we have to concentrate the 
parliamentary and party forces and tasks.

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the </F>
Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not given: "The 
Coalition Agreement Is Not a Mathematical Operation"] 
  [Text] As a result of the planned coalition agreement, the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will have a serious influence 
on the whole work of the government, rather than only on the 
operation of certain ministries, Ivan Peto claims. Peto 
believes that, if the agreement is signed, the conventions of 
the two parties will, in all probability, approve it. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] On the basis of various newspaper reports, 
it was expected that the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] would 
have eight and the SZDSZ four ministries in the new government. 
In view of the agreement reached on 20 June, do you think that 
the negotiating delegation managed to obtain adequate guarantees 
for the SZDSZ when the ministries were allocated? 
  [Peto] This agreement is not yet final, so the time has not 
yet come for drawing a balance. Many people believe that the 
coalition bargaining consists only of allocating ministries. 
However, in addition to this, we also have to agree on issues in 
connection with the government's order of business and on issues 
of guarantees. We also have to reach an agreement on issues of 
content because the policies of the coalition government will 
depend on these. Those who believe that the coalition agreement 
is purely a mathematical operation are wrong. I find it 
unfortunate if the starting point for someone is whether we get 
three or four ministries. It has to be remembered, for example, 
that the various ministries have different levels of influence 
on society's life. The agreement whose framework is being 
outlined will, in my view, ensure a decent position for the 
SZDSZ, the smaller coalition partner within the government. As 
a result of the planned coalition agreement, the SZDSZ will have 
a serious influence on the whole work of government, rather than 
only on the operation of certain ministries. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The party's convention on 26 June will have 
to approve the coalition agreement. Do you expect serious 
internal debates within the SZDSZ on accepting the agreement? 
  [Peto] As far as I know, we have also managed to assert a 
large proportion of our views in the special committees. On the 
basis of this, I can state that we did not only meet but 
actually exceeded the expectations of the convention that had 
empowered us to enter into the coalition talks. I am certain 
that we will have debates at the convention and at the 25 June 
meeting of the National Council, but if we sign the agreement, 
the deputies will most probably approve it. At the moment, 
there is a limited chance for debating this issue in the party 
because the contents of the final agreement cannot yet be known. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Together with MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn, you 
emphasized that the agreement on dividing up the ministries is 
not yet final. Do you think that serious changes are possible 
compared with what was published after the talks on 20 June? 
  [Peto] I do not see the coalition talks as closed because we 
still have to agree on issues of content. Serious debates can 
be expected in connection with this at today's session of the 
main delegations because many questions are waiting to be 
clarified. As for the ministries, some changes are still 
possible but this will not necessarily affect the proportions. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is there a chance for agreeing on the 
supervision of the National Security Office? 
  [Peto] The views of the two parties have become closer on 
this point, too, and the outlines of a compromise solution are 
emerging. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] When and at what forum will you decide who 
should fill the SZDSZ's government posts? 
  [Peto] Naturally, we have for a long time had ideas about 
whom we would like to nominate for the various government posts. 
The executive body will make the final decision once the full 
agreement is known.

  [Excerpts] Warsaw, 23 Jun--On 23 June in Warsaw, Foreign 
Ministers Andrzej Olechowski and Teodor Melescanu signed 
agreements between Poland and Romania on avoiding double 
taxation on income and property; mutual promotion and protection 
of investments; and cooperation in science, education, culture, 
and sports. 
  Also signed was the protocol on cooperation between the 
foreign ministries of both countries. Minister Olechowski said 
that "he strongly feels that relations between Poland and 
Romania do not reflect the needs and positions of both states in 
Europe." According to him, agreements signed on Thursday form 
the basis and make the commitment to widen Polish-Romanian 
cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  According to Melescanu, Romania can use Poland's experience 
in integration with West Europe, and "mutual efforts in this 
direction are in Romania's interest." He stressed that Poland 
and Romania are the most important countries in Central Europe 
and could play an important stabilization role in this region.

<F P=106> [Article by pw: "Dispute About Supervision Over Army; What </F>
Goryszewski Will Write"] 
  [Text] Henryk Goryszewski, chief of the National 
Security Bureau [BBN], which is associated with the Belweder, is 
writing a law on who will exercise supervision over the Army. 
"It is like telling a fox to guard a henhouse," say coalition 
Sejm deputies. 
  Yesterday, the National Defense Committee [KOK], which 
includes the president, the prime minister, Sejm and Senate 
speakers, the chief of the General Staff, the BBN chief, and the 
four most important ministers, adopted a document prepared by 
the National Defense Ministry [MON] entitled "Fundamental 
Problems of Poland's Defense System." 
  It is an assessment of the country's security and a 
demonstration of future directions for reforming the defense 
system, said Henryk Goryszewski at a press conference. We 
recommended the document to the Council of Ministers. We 
deleted only one or two little pages.... 
  But the problem is that these "little pages" relate to the 
most important issues, among them, who is to be the boss of the 
chief of the General Staff (Army commander): Is it the defense 
minister or the president? 
  KOK made a decision that Goryszewski will prepare a law 
dealing with all types of conflicts of powers and that he will 
present it in two weeks. According to unconfirmed sources, MON 
chief Piotr Kolodziejczyk was the author of the idea; he is 
clearly getting impatient with the ongoing debate on supervision 
of the Army. Prime Minister Pawlak supported Kolodziejczyk 
because he did not want to be at odds with the president. 
  The Council of Ministers Defense Issues Committee adopted a 
document entitled "Concerning Problems of the Country's 
Security" more than a month ago. In the document, the committee 
noted that an army's subordination to the defense minister is 
typical for European countries. 
  But Goryszewski is in favor of the Army's subordination to 
the president: One should counteract party influence over the 
Army. After all, the government in this country consists of 
parties and party coalitions. 
  In Goryszewski's view, MON has so far not come up with a 
draft law that would define the powers of the president and the 
minister. But, among the appendixes to the "Fundamental 
Problems..." there is such a draft law that contradicts the 
president's ideas. 
  Prolonging the dispute is very dangerous to the Polish Army, 
says former Defense Minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz of the Freedom 
Union. All of this should be settled soon, while the chief of 
the General Staff should be subordinated to the minister, just 
like it is done in a majority of European countries. 
  Well, KOK wants that, so let Goryszewski write, write, 
write..., Jerzy Szmajdzinski (Democratic Left Alliance), 
chairman of the Sejm Defense Commission, told GAZETA WYBORCZA in 
an indolent tone.

to say, either in December or January. We do not yet know who 
will be handling the operation. Negotiations are in progress, 
among others with Poland's largest banks and the Postal Service. 
I think that over 2,000 distribution centers should be set up 
throughout the country, so as to have at least one in each gmina 
[small administrative unit]. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How much will each participation 
certificate cost? 
  [Kaczmarek] Every adult citizen is entitled to receive a 
popular participation certificate. The appropriate statute 
provides that only registration fees will be collected, which 
will be up to 10 percent of the average salary. The 
certificates will be in the form of bearer securities. One will 
be able to sell or buy them from someone else for any price that 
is set. If a certificate is lost, destroyed, or stolen, no 
duplicate will be issued. Through brokerage houses making 
appropriate account transactions, it will be possible to 
exchange certificates for one of the shares in investment funds. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko 
recently presented "Strategy for Poland," which is the 
government's new economic program for the next three years. 
Among other things, it envisions speedy commercialization of 
large state-owned enterprises. What will happen next to the 
enterprises that are transformed into Treasury-owned joint-stock 
companies? 
  [Kaczmarek] Through commercialization, we want to introduce 
management of state wealth through capital partnerships [spolka 
kapitalowa] in order to have a situation where supervisory 
boards [rady nadzorcze] and not employee boards [rady 
pracownicze] play a decisive role in firms subject to the 
transformations. Employee boards destabilize the situation of 
many companies. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the "Strategy" program envisions the 
establishment of company boards [rady zakladowe]. 
  [Kaczmarek] It is an attempt to look for areas of agreement 
in cases where there are, for instance, 15 different trade 
unions in an enterprise. I cannot imagine negotiating with each 
of them separately. Company boards--perhaps the name is not 
good--are to represent the entire work force of a company. 
Currently, we are helpless, faced with cases of obvious law 
violations. The recent strike in "Katowice" Steeelworks, for 
example, was a violation of the principles defined by a statute 
concerning the settling of collective disputes. An agreement was 
signed on salary policies one day, and, the following day, a 
small trade union was capable of turning everything upside down 
through its strike, not paying attention to whether the firm can 
afford the demanded pay raises. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But, in partnerships based on the 
Commercial Law, there are work force representatives sitting on 
supervisory boards. 
  [Kaczmarek] Employee representatives sit on a supervisory 
board, while company boards are addressed at trade unions. This 
reflects the "higher-level area of agreement"--that is to say, 
the Trilateral Commission (government, employers, trade unions). 
In a commercialized company and privately owned firms, we 
suggest the following scheme: owner, supervisory board, company 
board. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will commercialization begin? 
  [Kaczmarek] I would like it to begin on 1 January 1995 and 
to finish the following day, but, because of administrative or 
legal obstacles, that will not be possible, so we plan on 
finalizing commercialization of the 1,500 largest enterprises in 
the second half of 1995. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the State Treasury continue 
to own these enterprises? 
  [Kaczmarek] We want to privatize them. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] By what method? 
  [Kaczmarek] Mainly by using the capital method and, to some 
extent, also through National Investment Funds. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] How long will the privatization done this 
way last? 
  [Kaczmarek] Ten to 20 years. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That long? 
  [Kaczmarek] It may seem like a long time, but let us look 
objectively at how much we succeeded in privatizing using the 
capital method over three years. It was several hundred firms. 
That is the most in Europe or the world, anyway. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Speaking about other countries' 
experiences, do you not think we could use the Czech example and 
carry out privatization of large state-owned enterprises through 
the coupon method? 
  [Kaczmarek] I think the Polish and Czech popular 
privatization programs will converge at some point in the 
future. Then we shall see who gained a bigger advantage. The 
Czechs began by going "from the bottom up": First coupons were 
issued, then they were exchanged for shares in the funds. What 
we want to do is set up the funds first and then issue popular 
participation certificates. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Polish popular privatization program 
covers just several hundred enterprises, while the Czech program 
covers almost all of them. One cannot compare the two. 
  [Kaczmarek] Given that we are muddling through conflicting 
interests right now, where every lobbying group wants to guard 
its own interest only instead of looking at macroeconomic 
policies, I cannot imagine coupon privatization being done in 
Poland. I am sorry, but I do not identify myself with the Czech 
philosophy of "capitalism coupons." 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But it may turn out that, in five years, 
the Czechs will have completely privatized their economy, and it 
will be much more efficient than the Polish one, which continues 
to be state-owned to a large extent. It is Czech firms and not 
Polish ones that attract more foreign capital. 
  [Kaczmarek] The Czechs recently announced that they have too 
much foreign capital. When it comes to Poland, you just cannot 
do everything contrary to public opinion. First, one must prove 
to the people that privately owned firms are more efficient than 
state-owned ones, and only then can one move on. One cannot 
draw such a conclusion from Polish privatization experiences. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Do you agree with the view that privately 
owned partnerships are more efficient than state-owned ones? 
  [Kaczmarek] Are you talking about the world or about Poland? 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Both. 
  [Kaczmarek] In other countries, the privately owned sector 
is indeed clearly more efficient than the state-owned one. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Does it follow that you regard Poland to be 
an abnormal country and that you want to consolidate inefficient 
structures here? 
  [Kaczmarek] No. I want to carry out privatization, but that 
requires time. We are certainly not planning on "preserving and 
stabilizing the old arrangement," as Henryka Bochniarz, who was 
the industry minister in the Bielecki Cabinet, says. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The Czechs have already demonstrated that 
one can privatize practically anything, even the refinery 
industry or regional railways. They have 900 enterprises 
registered on their stock market, whereas we have just 25. 
  [Kaczmarek] Yes, but what kind of a stock market is it 
really? Look at the enterprises, the share values, and the 
procedures applied. All of that is of very poor quality, so 
what you are saying does not convince me. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why are the railways or the refinery 
industry not being privatized in Poland? 
  [Kaczmarek] Why do you ask me that? 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because you are the ownership 
transformations minister... 
  [Kaczmarek] But I am not responsible for that. Address 
these questions to the transportation minister and the industry 
minister. Once I represent the owner of these firms, I will try 
to answer your questions. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the institution of 
the State Treasury? 
  [Kaczmarek] The Finance Ministry has prepared a draft that 
is based on a French/Italian model and that envisions the 
establishment of a management operating within the structures of 
state-owned enterprises through several different holding 
companies. The model, especially its Italian version, was a 
disaster. I am opposed to the idea because I do not want the 
emergence of another field for corruption. The Ministry of 
Ownership Transformations [MPW] proposes a merger of the 
structures of regional State Treasury offices, the MPW's 
regional branches, and departments of economic development and 
privatization in voivodship offices into single bodies called 
"agencies." Under the MPW's supervision, they will be managing 
the State Treasury's wealth at the regional level. We want to 
abandon central economic management. The proposal is included in 
the "Strategy for Poland" program. There is no question of a 
ministerial approach. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What will happen next to the 
reprivatization law? 
  [Kaczmarek] Its draft was transferred over for 
interministerial consultations. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] When will it be debated again by the 
Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers? 
  [Kaczmarek] In a month or two. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] A few months ago, you said that a 
reprivatization referendum would be absurd. Right now, you, 
along with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and Deputy Prime 
Minister Grzegorz Kolodko, are in favor of voting on the issue 
of returning property to its rightful owners. 
  [Kaczmarek] I think that at times it is worth asking people 
whether they are willing to take the burden stemming from 
decisions that were made 50 years ago. We have adopted the 
principle that, as of 1945, a lawful legal order was in 
operation in Poland, and there are currently no reasons or 
conditions to apply the principle of restitution of property. 
So reprivatization will not mean a return of everything that 
was nationalized but only reimbursements for that property that 
was taken illegally. Former owners will receive reprivatization 
coupons in return. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But these coupons will be worth less than 
the property that was plundered. 
  [Kaczmarek] Why do you say that? 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Since you assume a degression scale will be 
applied on property worth over Z2 billion, everybody knows even 
now that the coupons' value will be lower than the value of the 
property. 
  [Kaczmarek] If we were not to adopt a degression scale, 
then, according to our estimates, the reprivatization would cost 
the state as much as Z200 trillion, and that would be only in 
the case of law violations that occurred between 1944 and 1958. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] That is not the reprivatization cost but an 
estimated value of the property that is being claimed by former 
owners. Tell us how much exactly taxpayers would have to pay in 
order for the state to return a plundered mill, a brickyard, or 
a manor house with a park to its owner? 
  [Kaczmarek] That is easy to calculate. It would be about Z6 
trillion out of the state budget. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] According to what criteria? 
  [Kaczmarek] According to simple simulation... 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] What simulation are you talking about? 
  [Kaczmarek] What do you mean what simulation?! This is 
property that is in the hands of the state... 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state is not its owner. 
  [Kaczmarek] What do you mean the state is not its owner?! 
No, this conversation makes no sense at all... 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Mr. Minister, the state is just managing 
the property... 
  [Kaczmarek] And please explain to me why you are saying 
something like that. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Because the property was illegally taken 
away from its owners... 
  [Kaczmarek] No, it was not. It was nationalized in 
accordance with the appropriate laws. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] But the state budget does not include the 
property. 
  [Kaczmarek] What do you mean? 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] The state budget is a list of state 
revenues and expenditures. 
  [Kaczmarek] Exactly. Property can be sold, and revenue 
accruing from the sale can be listed in the budget. 
  [ZYCIE WARSZAWY] Why cannot at least part of the plundered 
property be returned in its natural form? 
  [Kaczmarek] Because I do not want to have hundreds or 
thousands of conflicts. That is because I do not know why I am 
supposed to return a mill in Siedlce Voivodship in its natural 
form but not one in Ciechanow Voidodship because over there it 
would result in a major brawl. Everybody will be treated 
equally in the process; there will be no better or worse people. 
They will receive their coupons for which they will be able to 
purchase real estate. Nothing will be returned to them.

<F P=106> [Interview with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Union of Freedom </F>
chairman and former prime minister, by correspondent Bohdan 
Onichimowski; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Onichimowski] Your name is associated with the 
launch of the "Polish five minutes" in the history of 
contemporary Europe. Are these five minutes finished now? 
  [Mazowiecki] These five minutes have already lasted five 
years, and those five years could well have been 15 if we judge 
by the larger-than-life scale of the events that took place 
then. Whether our five minutes are still going on is a different 
question altogether. Certain fundamental issues have been 
resolved already. We are an independent and autonomous state, 
all decisions about us are made here and not somewhere else, and 
the direction of our economic future has been determined. You 
could say that we are now at a new moment in our history: The 
first stage is gone, and we must begin to build the second one. 
  [Onichimowski] But is the run of good luck for Poland in the 
international arena still with us? 
  [Mazowiecki] It is quite surprising, but Poland's economic 
achievements are noted with approval against the background of 
Central and East Europe as a whole. It is even said that we are 
the "economic tigers" in this part of the continent. So you can 
see that the judgment of outside observers is much more 
favorable than those from commentators at home. Of course, I 
understand that such outside arguments are no good when it comes 
to convincing an unemployed person that our economy is good, but 
when you look at the problem in the light of all considerations, 
the opinions and the forecasts are good. 
  [Onichimowski] A few days ago, Jacek Kuron said that our 
road to Europe leads through the East--via Minsk, Kiev, and 
Moscow.... 
  [Mazowiecki] I believe that this slogan conveyed the idea 
that good, open relations with these countries will result in an 
extended Europe, and, from Europe's viewpoint, the way in which 
Poland relates to these neighbors is most important. 
  [Onichimowski] But do you not believe that, at present, 
cooperation with these states has, as it were, slowed down a 
little? 
  [Mazowiecki] There is something in what you are saying. I 
believe that we must galvanize our foreign and economic 
policies. I can also say that I believe Minister Olechowski is 
trying to do just that. I agree with those who believe that any 
oversight on our part in these areas would be a serious mistake. 
However, there is also a wider phenomenon to be considered: 
The green grass of our new social and economic processes often 
grows faster than we think. I was once guest at a conference 
organized by the Robert Schuman Foundation, attended by 
delegates of a variety of associations and organizations of a 
pro-European persuasion, and I realized that there are very many 
such bodies in Poland. So I hope that there are also 
associations and organizations that are thinking of developing 
the eastward direction. And, if there are none, we must set 
them up and encourage them to be active. 
  [Onichimowski] We heard recently from a group of Bundestag 
deputies visiting Szczecin that our full participation in 
European structures would be conditional on making land 
available for sale without any restrictions. Would you accept 
such a condition if you were prime minister? 
  [Mazowiecki] All countries have certain regulations 
regulating the sale of land to foreigners. You must not 
preclude the possibility of such transactions, but the state can 
control their form and extent. Such control mechanisms are a 
normal thing and should be preserved. 
  [Onichimowski] As I point out that next year will see the 
50th anniversary of the inclusion of Szczecin within our 
national territory, let me also remind you that you have special 
obligations toward the citizens of Szczecin. Should we remember 
our city's 50th anniversary, or should we forget it because it 
was politically incorrect forces that captured the city and 
politically incorrect decisions that decreed it would henceforth 
belong to Poland? 
  [Mazowiecki] No, no.... The anniversary is a most important 
occasion, and Szczecin, which is a very fine port city, has a 
significant role to play in both Poland and Europe. 
  [Onichimowski] This sounds a bit as if you were trying to 
canvas for Szczecinians' votes in the forthcoming election.... 
  [Mazowiecki] I intend to do that, too. I believe that the 
vote of confidence I received here will be extended to 
accommodate voters' confidence in the Union of Freedom. I have 
already noted that the influence wielded by the Union of Freedom 
in this region is growing steadily, and our activists and 
sympathizers are dynamic individuals who want to achieve great 
things not so much for the party as such, but for the whole 
region--and who are capable of achieving it. Let me tell 
you--and this is not a superficial compliment--that the Szczecin 
region could easily become one of the best-developing areas of 
Poland. 
  [Onichimowski] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Dramatic Hours of Kolozsvar -- </F>
Archeological Excavations To Start Today"] 
  [Text] There is a pogrom mood in Kolozsvar [Cluj]. Mayor 
Gheorghe Funar has announced that the archeological excavations 
around the statue of King Matthias in the center of town will 
begin today. He also promised to take legal steps against 
demonstrators, after the Democratic Union of Hungarians in 
Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in Romanian] mobilized the population for 
a protest meeting at 1300. 
  We are aware of the fact that the planned archeological 
excavations in the center of town do not serve scientific 
purposes. It is a political provocation aimed at dismantling the 
statue of King Matthias, reads the appeal of the Kolozsvar 
county organization of the RMDSZ to the population of the town. 
  According to the RMDSZ, the planned action against the 
town's 
main square and the famous statue is the last straw in violation 
of the national dignity of the ethnic Hungarians in Romania. 
The RMDSZ called upon the entire population of Kolozsvar to 
participate in a protest rally organized on the main square at 
1300 on 22 June in order to defend the statue and the St Michael 
Cathedral. 
  The mood in Kolozsvar has become extremely tense in the wake 
of the planned excavations, the removal of Josef Bem's memorial 
plaque, and the latest nationalist anticultural and 
anti-Hungarian provocations. In view of this fact, the 
operative council of the RMDSZ has been convened in Kolozsvar 
for this afternoon. 
  Given the fact that the municipal council failed to gather 
the necessary votes to allocate 30 million lei to finance the 
excavations, Gheorghe Funar proposed to postpone the debate. 
However, they announced that they would begin the excavations, 
even without the approval of the municipal council because the 
Historical Museum of Transsylvania allocated 10 million lei for 
this purpose. 
  Museum Director Gheorghe Lazarovici pointed out that the 
excavations are meant to "prove the continuity of the Romanian 
people" because the archeological excavations that began at the 
beginning of the last century were discontinued in 1943, and the 
scientific evaluation of the results took place in Budapest. If 
we cannot prove our thousands-of-years presence here with 
written documents, then we will dig in the main square of 
Kolozsvar for as long as 20 years to find the proof from the 
earth, Lazarovici said. 
  In the municipality meeting on 20 June, Funar pointed out 
that he would erase everything that refers to this town's 
Hungarian character and, at the next municipal council meeting, 
he would propose to change the name of the town to Napoca. 
Nicolae Ruja, an adviser of the Romanian National Unity Party, 
expressed the opinion that the statue in question should be 
located in the Hunedoara Castle rather than on the main square 
of Kolozsvar. 
  At a news conference on 21 June, Funar declared that the 
excavations would commence on 22 June. He said that it is 
impossible for this plan to generate any tension. If, however, 
those who are displeased decide to, nevertheless, demonstrate on 
the main square, he would use the legal stipulations regarding 
unannounced demonstrations and the offenders would be arrested. 
According to Funar, the Roman Catholic Church should not hinder 
the excavations because the National Council for the Protection 
of Monuments has already approved them. 
  In the Hungarian-language daily SZABADSAG published in 
Kolozsvar, Roman Catholic Dean Arpad Czirjak drew the attention 
of the Hungarians in Transsylvania to the fact that the Romanian 
nationalists are preparing for a final showdown against King 
Matthias' successors. 
  Both Hungarians and rationally thinking Romanians argued a 
lot for giving up the aforementioned plans in recent weeks. 
However, it seems that arguments no longer help. There is a 
pogrom mood in Kolozsvar.

  [Text] Currently, at the UDMR [Democratic Union of 
Hungarians in Romania] headquarters in Cluj, a news conference 
is taking place organized by the ethnic Hungarians' associations 
and organizations, as well as representatives of the Roman 
Catholic and Reformed Churches. 
  Among the audience there are distinguished authors members 
of 
the UDMR, among whom Sandor Fodor, the deputy chairman of the 
PEN Club of the Hungarian authors living in Romania, Kalman 
Csiha, the Cluj Roman Catholic bishop, Laszlo Tokes, the Oradea 
Reformed Church bishop, and experts in various domains of 
history and culture, our correspondent, Florin Zaharia, reports. 
  The goal of today's news conference in Cluj is to present 
the 
stance of the UDMR opposing the beginning of the archaeological 
excavations in the center of that municipality.

<F P=106> ["M.P."-signed report: "Name Sign Scandal in Transylvania, </F>
Too"] 
  [Text] On 21 June in Mures county, county police and road 
maintenance workers knocked down and smashed bilingual 
(Hungarian- Romanian) signs on the order of the prefect. Law 
enforcement units entered the private territories where the 
bilingual signs were located without the permission or agreement 
of the owners. 
  The police removed signs in more than 20 localities in Mures 
county. The statement of the county organization of the 
Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania [RMDSZ -- UDMR in 
Romanian] published on 22 June condemns the anti-Hungarian 
provocation in Mures county. The statement specially emphasizes 
the Council of Europe documents and recommendations the Romanian 
government undertook to observe and whose edicts are ignored by 
the county prefect, the police, and the employees of other state 
offices.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Maria Vintan: "General Mobilization in the </F>
PDSR -- Adrian Nastase Is Preparing for War"] 
  [Text] Adrian Nastase, executive president of the 
government party, is a person who, as a diplomat, is worth as 
much as an army of generals. One can observe his dexterity in 
keeping everyone satisfied and avoiding any scandal. However, 
for some time, the unchallenged president of the Chamber of 
Deputies has been going through difficult times. 
  He is being forced to change his tune. The first sign that 
should have warned him was his mini-conflict with Ion Iliescu at 
the Crans-Montana forum. The suspicions of some observers who, 
at the time, risked declaring that the "punch" Ion Iliescu gave 
his favorite was directed by other persons in the background 
have now been confirmed. Well-informed sources from the 
Cotroceni Palace admitted that, during that period, the 
president was poorly advised by his advisers. The most 
frequently repeated advice was: "It is too dangerous for you to 
propel Nastase forward so much." At that time, Nastase was 
supposed to mediate in the 'Arafat-Perez dialogue. Iliescu only 
sacrificed his pupil for something for which Ceausescu would 
have sacrificed his own right hand. What Iliescu did not know, 
but his advisers suspected, was that Adrian Nastase would react 
so violently. Once the ground was prepared, the rest was 
child's play. Convinced that the executive chairman had to be 
taught a lesson for his impertinence, Iliescu gave his advisers 
and their men in the party the green light. 
  Shortly after that, reports on Adrian Nastase's houses 
appeared in ADEVARUL. The file was urgently taken over by "jack 
of all trades" Ioan Gavra, secretary of the Investigation 
Committee. Initially disappointed by this attack which, 
according to persons in his entourage, he suspected would come, 
but did not believe would be "so mean," Adrian Nastase declared 
a general mobilization in the party. According to people in the 
know, the pacifist and mild chairman proves to be extremely 
rude. However, his enemies have a great advantage, namely they 
are one step ahead of him and they also enjoy Ion Iliescu's 
support. In addition, they have been preparing for this 
confrontation for a long time. All recent speculations about 
reformers and conservatives in the PDSR [Social Democracy Party 
of Romania] proved to be more than empty words, and the latest 
compromise actions of Adrian Nastase are the best proof for 
this. But, as we know, communists do not forgive, no matter how 
much proof of loyalty one gives them. Their greatest fear is 
that Ion Iliescu might change his mind. He recently gave some 
signs in this direction, and caused panic among his advisers, 
who urgently warned their party colleagues. Dan Martian [former 
president of the Chamber of Deputies], who wants to regain his 
position of president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Ioan 
Solcanu, who dreams to become the party chairman, have 
accelerated the pace and it seems that they have just arrived at 
the last 100 meters. 
  A very well informed person told us that the recent changes 
of direction in the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party (National 
Salvation Front]) are actually the aftershocks caused by the 
upheaval in the PDSR. Apart from a few loyal men in the party, 
Adrian Nastase seems to have no one else. He must form 
alliances. And whom could the former foreign minister think 
about first if not his former colleagues in the cabinet. The 
latest developments in the PD(FSN) are the extension of those in 
the PDSR. The following statement of the man who told us all 
this, naturally interested, is much too audacious to be ignored: 
"There is only one small step from here to an alliance between 
PD(FSN) and a possible faction of the PDSR." In any case, what 
seems to be certain is that we will have a series of surprises 
during the parliamentary vacation. 
  The first surprise will emerge at the PDSR National Council 
that will begin deliberations as early as next week.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 23 (AFP) -- The Bosnian Parliament 
Thursday unanimously re-elected Haris Silajdzic as prime 
minister of the new, deeply re-shuffled Bosnian Government which 
now includes six Croat ministers. Silajdzic will head a 
government acting not only as government of Bosnia but also of 
the Croat-Moslem federation in Bosnia which will officially come 
into being as soon as legislative elections scheduled for 
September are held. 
  There are 11 Moslem ministers including the prime minister 
and Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, who kept his portfolio, 
as well as the ministers of the interior, transport, industry 
and energy, refugees and social affairs, education, environment 
and three with no portfolios. The six Croat ministers include 
Jadranko Prlic who was appointed defence minister and deputy 
prime minister. The Croats hold the finance, justice, health 
and trade portfolios and one minister has no fixed portfolio. 
Each minister's deputy will be from the opposing ethnic group. 
  Political analysts say that as the men in both governments 
are the same, with Bosnian Serbs occupying 70 percent of Bosnia 
and the ethnic divisions of the country having been radically 
modified in two years of warfare, the day-to-day management of 
affairs is likely to remain unchanged. However, what is new is 
that the zones currently controlled by the Croat forces of 
Bosnia, that is the central area and practically the whole of 
Herzegovina, will be managed by Croats within the new government. 
  The existing structures are likely to change name, and the 
Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, declared before the Federation, 
is likely to be diffused into the eight federal cantons: four 
Moslem majority, two Croat majority and two mixed. 
  The president of the Federation, moderate Croat Kresimir 
Zubak, and his vice-president, Moslem Ejup Ganic, were appointed 
in May.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnia-Herzegovina </F>
Ambassador to the UN, by Lidia Cerni; place and date not given: 
"I Do Not Believe in Just Peace"] 
  [Text] If I had to single out the person with whom I most 
enjoyed talking during my professional career while at the same 
time having the biggest technical problems, then this would 
definitely be Muhamed Sacirbey, the young (born in Sarajevo 
1956) Bosnia-Herzegovina ambassador to the UN. Although, as he 
says himself, "he speaks Bosnian with more difficulty than he 
should have and his thoughts are always running ahead" he asked 
me to forgive him if he used any English words in the interview. 
His very successful two-year diplomatic career speaks of him 
personally and professionally more than any biography. Sacirbey 
graduated from law school in 1980 and a year later finished the 
Columbia Business School. Before his diplomatic assignment he 
worked as a very successful lawyer in a U.S. company 
specializing in international law. What probably predetermined 
Sacirbey for the diplomatic post in America were his manner, 
diplomatic skill, perfect English, and feeling for the right 
time and place. 
  [Cerni] The latest U.S. Congress resolution about the 
lifting of the arms embargo for the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government has fully demonstrated the duplicity of the U.S. 
policy. The administration with the exception of verbal 
statements about the need to lift the unjust embargo has not 
done much so far while the Senate and the Congress have been 
faced for the second time with the decision whether or not to 
lift the embargo. How do you assess the latest resolution? 
  [Sacirbey] I believe that this is an important political and 
also symbolic decision. It is much more important than the 
actual implications on the battlefield. This resolution places 
a certain pressure on Europe and Russia, and also on Serbia, to 
reach a sort of peace settlement. I believe that some of the 
commentaries in Europe and even in the U.S. administration that 
the Congress resolution is not the right way are wrong. We in 
Bosnia care about peace and not war, as some think, wrongly 
anticipating our moves if the arms embargo were lifted. We 
would like to create a sort of equilibrium and make the peace 
talks proceed. Neither Europe nor America were willing to 
provide us with the necessary balance of power and the U.S. 
Congress has demonstrated a better understanding of the Bosnian 
problem than the U.S. administration. This is not merely a 
problem of "the victim of the Serbian aggression" which has a 
legitimate right to self-defense but a problem of principles and 
tactical conceptions, so to speak. This is the equilibrium of 
which I speak. We care a lot about peace, however, a peace that 
can last. 
  [Cerni] Russia, some European countries, and Canada are 
opposed to the unilateral U.S. lifting of arms embargo, and even 
President Clinton, although the decision is binding, can pass a 
veto. What will happen if he does so? 
  [Sacirbey] President Clinton must accept the consequences of 
this resolution because it is binding. I believe that he will 
also find it difficult to use his veto because this resolution 
is linked to a whole "package" of documents that give money for 
the U.S. defense and the Pentagon. I understand that numerous 
European countries, and even Canada, are not thrilled with the 
latest resolution because their soldiers are deployed in Bosnia. 
Many in the West, who have been "pushing" for "peace 
agreements" for Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia have with their 
stance in a way recognized the Serbian conquests in Bosnia and 
the results of a genocide, they have acknowledged that Serbia is 
the most powerful and the mightiest in the former Yugoslavia. 
The resolution could now shake up this concept and the victim 
of the Serbian aggression could finally get the opportunity to 
achieve the same position on the ground. This would be a direct 
threat to Serbian military predominance in this war. 
  [Cerni] If America lifts the arms embargo for Bosnia 
unilaterally then could this give impetus to consultations and 
talks in the UN Security Council about the passing of a similar 
decision? 
  [Sacirbey] This is a truly interesting question. I have 
talked to numerous people in America and the Security Council 
these days and the fact is that Americans do not have a 
determined plan, that is to say, strategy in this situation yet. 
I believe that they should put pressure on their friends and 
allies in the world to create a new strategy on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina that would penalize the Serbian aggression 
and the genocide more. This means that they would have to 
deploy bigger forces, for example through NATO or the systems of 
the UN Security Council, and truly lift the embargo. The worst 
thing that can happen is that the U.S. Congress would work in 
one direction and the U.S. administration in another. This 
would have direct consequences on the UN Security Council. 
  [Cerni] Many who are opposed to the lifting of the arms 
embargo claim that you are receiving arms from your Muslim 
friends in the world despite the embargo. 
  [Sacirbey] The lifting of the embargo would contribute to a 
peaceful solution for Bosnia and not to war. The peace process 
is a lengthy process and for the first time it gives the victim 
the right to self-defense. On the other hand, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government was always of the opinion that the 
embargo imposed on it was unlawful and not binding for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and we have, thus, so far been forced to 
seek aid from anyone who wanted to help us. These are our 
friends and one cannot demand from any country in the world that 
has been the victim of aggression not to defend itself. This is 
stipulated in Article 51 of the UN. Naturally, we have accepted 
the aid that was offered to us for the defense of our country. 
Many would like to portray us as an Islamic country that has 
linked itself with the Islamic countries worldwide, which is not 
true. We are receiving aid and political support from various 
different countries. One should actually look where Serbia is 
getting its aid from. There are numerous gaps in the embargo 
against Serbia, it is smuggling oil, arms, and all other 
produce. On the other hand, the countries that speak most 
feverishly against the so-called Islamic danger in this region 
most frequently help the Fascist regime in Belgrade. However, 
this fact sheds a light on something else. Namely, a new 
alliance of the former communists and the neo-fascists is being 
forged in the former Communist Europe. This is connected to a 
desire to preserve the old "regimes," their infrastructure, and 
their armies. In the new system of free exchange of goods and 
democracy there is no need for Russia or Serbia to have such big 
armies and so many arms, especially if one bears in mind their 
"economic strength." 
  [Cerni] You have numerous friends among the Jews and the 
Americans and many ascribe the success of the latest Congress 
resolution to the powerful lobbying of the 
Muslim-Jewish-American circles. How big is this influence in 
fact? 
  [Sacirbey] The main man behind this Congress resolution is 
Senator Bob Dole. There is a Croat woman, a great friend of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, working in his office. The truth is that we 
have some influence, however, in general the Muslims have not 
had too great an influence on the creation of U.S. policy. 
However, the Jews have a huge influence in America and we are 
very grateful to them for everything that they have done so that 
this resolution could see the light of day. 
  [Cerni] Let us return to Bosnia. What are your conclusions 
about the observation of the four-week cease-fire that has 
recently been agreed in Geneva? 
  [Sacirbey] Unfortunately, I cannot say anything about this 
because I do not have the information that is currently going on 
in the military sphere. However, it is important to emphasize 
that I personally was very satisfied with the talks with the 
contact group and [UN envoy] Mr. Akashi, and especially 
satisfied with the cooperation of the Croats and the Bosniaks in 
these talks. This has all led to a certain strengthening of our 
position in the peace talks. The talks about a political 
solution with the contact group are the most important as 
without them no concept of cease-fire is possible. There must 
be a powerful connection between our political talks here in 
Bosnia and the international factors, especially the contact 
group and Mr. Akashi. 
  [Cerni] Can you comment on the scope of present talks of the 
warring sides with the contact group. I am particularly 
interested in the maps of division and the issue of the Serbian 
corridor through the Bosnian Sava Basin. 
  [Sacirbey] I believe that it is too soon to discuss such 
issues because the contact group has not yet finished its job. I 
think that the issue of the so-called gray zones is very 
important. This is an opportunity to find a solution for the 
refugees and their permanent return to their homes. This is not 
merely a question of the Muslim refugees but also of the Croats 
who have escaped from the Serbian terror in Bosnia to Croatia. 
Unfortunately, it is forgotten that numerous Croats have been 
the victims of ethnic cleansing and genocide. We believe that 
these people should not seek permanent shelter in Croatia but 
should return to their homes. For this reason the concept of 
the gray zones can be applied in those regions where the Croats 
and the Muslims constituted the majority before the war, these 
are the towns such as Prijedor, Visegrad, Zvornik, and so forth. 
  [Cerni] What do you think about the scope of the 
Croatian-Bosniak Federation, that is to say, the results of the 
Washington agreement? How do you view the visit of [Croatian] 
President Tudjman in Sarajevo? 
  [Sacirbey] I am satisfied with the results so far and it 
seems that they are improving increasingly. The most important 
thing is that there is peace, that the people are not dying. 
However, we must go further. Some elements, especially in 
Herzegovina, are not exactly thrilled with this peace and we 
should, therefore, appease all the sides so that this peace may 
live. I am satisfied with the cooperation of Zagreb and 
Sarajevo so far, even though the cooperation in the Federation 
itself is proceeding somewhat slowly. 
  [Cerni] Finally, do you believe in a just peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina or can the term of a just peace be viewed 
only philosophically. Bearing in mind the situation on the 
field -- the Serbs hold 70 percent of Bosnian territory and in 
the negotiations with the contact group 51 versus 49 percent to 
the advantage of the Federation are being offered -- do you 
believe in a just peace after this war? 
  [Sacirbey] The concept of the so-called just peace can be 
accomplished only with difficulty in Bosnia-Herzegovina at this 
moment. However, we cannot agree to a concept that would offer 
less than a lasting peace, that is to say, what we call "a just 
and lasting peace and such a country." Just peace would be if 
the Chetnik forces were definitively defeated. For as long as 
the Serbs are behind the negotiating table I find it difficult 
to speak about it. We must seek peace in which 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to constitute itself as a 
country that will be fully functional and will be a country in 
the true sense of this word. We are aspiring toward a country 
that will reintegrate itself in the international processes like 
all other countries that have emerged from the inferno of 
Yugoslavia's disintegration. For this reason I am glad about 
the normalization of the relations in the Croat-Bosniak 
federation because the people are slowly returning to their 
homes. However, for as long as [republic of Srpska president] 
Karadzic and [republic of Srpska army commander] Mladic lead the 
Bosnian Serbs it will be difficult to achieve a just peace. 
They are the chief creators of this war and they must be held 
accountable for it. In its efforts, Europe is looking more for 
a realistic than a just peace in Bosnia. If we look for a 
realistic peace, then this must contain at least a certain 
degree of fairness and above all "a concept of the functioning 
of the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina." We can never agree to the 
reality if Bosnia-Herzegovina remains a crippled country.

  [Text] London, June 23 (TANJUG) -- The international 
"Contact Group" for Bosnia-Herzegovina is expected by Tuesday 
[28 June] to complete the maps for the division of the 
ex-Yugoslav republic into a Moslem-Croat and a Serb part, it was 
learned in diplomatic circles in London on Thursday. The same 
sources recall that Russia and the United States will have the 
final say on conditions for peace in Bosnia at the G-7 summit in 
Naples from July 8-10. 
  There are indications that Russia and the United States 
could 
present their own peace plan independently of the "Contact 
Group," although they, themselves, are represented in it. This 
creates further confusion in connection with the international 
community's anyway frail initiative for peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. British political analysts on Thursday said 
they were surprised by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's 
statement that he did not rule out the possibility of the 
exemption of the Bosnian Moslems from the U.N. arms embargo. 
  The change in the Russian stand has increased fears that the 
arms embargo could be lifted, which would almost certainly lead 
to the continuation of the war, according to British 
assessments. It is recalled in London that the U.S. Senate is 
on Thursday to adjust its decision on the exemption of the 
Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo with a similar decision 
taken by the House of Representatives. 
  The U.N. protocol and, indirectly, U.N. Secretary-General 
Butrus Butrus-Ghali, himself, have made it impossible for U.N. 
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Gen. Michael Rose, who is best acquainted with the situation in 
the field, to explain to the U.S. senators how disastrous such a 
policy would prove to be. Under the U.N. protocol, only the 
head and the commander of the U.N. Protection Force for the 
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) can present their views on the 
matter.

  [Text] Sarajevo, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- "Information that is 
available to us indicates that the work of the Contact Group is 
in its final stage," Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the republic 
of Srpska's people's assembly, told journalists today. "What we 
do know from reliable sources is that the Contact Group is in a 
dilemma about whether certain areas should be defined as gray 
zones or divided cities," said Krajisnik. "Neither is 
acceptable for the Serbian side, because our standpoint is that 
only clear-cut solutions can be a guarantee for lasting peace," 
Krajisnik said, recalling that during the contacts so far with 
members of the Contact Group, especially with the French and 
British, the Serbian side made this stand perfectly clear. 
  Commenting on Christopher's and Kozyrev's statements in 
Brussels, Krajisnik said that the aim of such statements was to 
exert pressure on all the sides in the conflict to accept the 
proposed solutions, while the main pressure was put on the 
Serbian side. 
  "The imposed solutions do not, however, lead toward peace 
and 
it is, therefore, justified to exchange arguments to see which 
sides are interested in which of the controversial areas in 
order to establish whose demand is more justified. Here I refer 
first of all, to areas in western and eastern Bosnia, and in 
Posavina," said Krajisnik. He recalled that the international 
community must bear in mind the fact that Serbs in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina already have a compact state territory, while 
efforts are being made to achieve the compactness of the 
Muslim-Croat federation by means of encroaching upon vital Serb 
interests to the detriment of Serbian territorial integrity. 
  "We accept that the Muslim side should explain why it 
insists 
on the enclaves that seriously effect the compactness of our 
territory, and if their arguments prove to be well-grounded and 
realistic we will acknowledge them," said Krajisnik.

  [Text] Zagreb, 23 June (TANJUG) -- Milan Djukic, chairman 
of the Serb National Party [SNS] in Zagreb, today sent an open 
letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, warning him that 
his speech in Pazin [Istria] yesterday, on the occasion of 
antifascist struggle day, was "fraught with insults to the 
Serbian people in Croatia." 
  "Your speech will hardly contribute to the return of the 
Croatian Serbs' confidence in the Croatian authorities," Djukic 
said. "You have hurt the Serb people in Croatia, who will not 
forgive you or endorse parts of your Pazin speech as the truth," 
Djukic stressed in his letter, telling Tudjman that he indeed 
was a historian, "but not as authoritative as to be in a 
position to change the history of these parts." Historians have 
been at odds as to where the first shots of resistance were 
fired in Croatia, but 27 July 1941 certainly cannot be described 
as "the date when chetniks from Knin and Bosnia rose in 
rebellion," Djukic wrote in his letter.

  [Text] [Announcer] A session of the Council for Istria was 
held on Brijuni today under the chairmanship of Franjo Tudjman, 
the president of the republic. Zdravko Kleva reporting. 
  [Kleva] [Video shows Brijuni and the meeting] Assessing the 
international position of Croatia and Istria and problems at the 
local level, it was seen as useful to form an advisory body. 
Consequently, journalists were told after the constituent 
session in Brijuni, the Council for Istria was formed. Today's 
session was attended by 12 of the 17 members appointed by Franjo 
Tudjman, the head of state. Other state officials also attended. 
  [Begin recording] [Nevio Sesto, not further identified] We 
know that two people are out of the country and they could not 
attend. Two more people apologized for not being able to 
attend. Only one member has not turned up without a word. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] There was one more member. 
  [Sesto] Yes, we received a request to extend our membership, 
that is, that a member of the Istrian County branch of the 
Association of Croatian Volunteers in the War for the Homeland 
wanted to join us, and we accepted that. We expect the 
president of the republic to soon appoint Mr. Ivan Pletikosa as 
a new member of the Council for Istria. [end recording] 
  [Kleva] The Council for Istria will be active in five groups 
which will propose solutions for strategic issues in 
Istria--from demographic issues and those concerning culture and 
education to economic issues. Advisory groups will be set up to 
work on relations between the state administration and local 
government. The council will present its proposals to county and 
central state authorities. 
  [Begin Monsignor Josip Pavlisic, president of the Council 
for 
Istria, recording] On my part, I believe that it is useful to 
give a good word or thought to those who seek our advice in 
order to coordinate the needs and wishes of the head of the 
republic and local bodies. We are not advising political 
parties, but people holding certain posts. The president of the 
republic is the president of all Croats and people living on 
Croatian territory. We decided that we had to take that into 
account, and our actions, discussions, and advice will not refer 
to a party or the opposition, but how best to achieve the best 
conditions for development and improvement of living conditions. 
[end recording] 
  [Kleva] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman invited 
representatives of the local public and political life to a 
luncheon in honor of the members of the Council for Istria 
today. The mayors of Istrian towns and Istrian County Prefect 
Luciano Delbianco apologized and did not attend the luncheon.

<F P=106> [Article by Gojko Marinkovic, AIM: "From the Croatian Dinar </F>
to the Croatian Kuna"] 
  [Text] Croatian President Tudjman has once again been 
proving his obstinacy, arbitrariness, and messianism, but at the 
same time his reputation as a dubious historian and scholar, 
because he has used his power and a raft of pseudoarguments to 
impose on Croatia a new currency, as of 30 May, Statehood Day, 
which is called the kuna. 
  There were no warnings or assurances that could dissuade him 
from his intention: "The president of the republic," Dr. Ivo 
Banac, well-known Croatian historian at Yale, the prestigious 
American university, said the other day, "cannot go to Knin or 
to Glina, but he can impose the ustasha monetary unit. Entire 
barrels of learned ink have already been consumed to prove what 
cannot be proven, that is, that the kuna is a living tradition 
of the Croatian people--not a Pavelic invention--the kuna was 
used in the 13th century, the kuna is on the Slavonian crest, 
and it is our most original kuna. This pseudoscientific battle 
of wits deserves only scorn. This is the shabbiest invention of 
tradition with the difference that the invented Scotch tartans 
(tribal weaves) are something that can be turned into money, 
while the only thing that can be paid with the kuna is Pavelic's 
bills, which were always anything but Croatian. We who all our 
lives in distant parts of the world have been defending Croatia 
from what we might call kunism, can now give thanks to Tudjman, 
the former political commissar, for this particularly pregnant 
act of reconciliation. We will see how long it takes before Dr. 
Tudjman apologizes for this brainstorm. The `only' pity is that 
his `Trackless...' and kunas are paid for by others, 
for example, the refugees from Vukovar or Konavale, whom Serbian 
propaganda has always represented as coauthors of 
`Trackless...,' or troglodytes wearing the fur of the 
marten [kuna]." 
  The man who compares himself to Jesus, because on two 
occasions in past days he has declared "Even among Christ's 12 
apostles, one betrayed him, the other denied him, and the rest, 
but for one, did not follow him on his road to the cross," thus 
decided that the Croats shall no longer precede money amounts by 
HRD [Croatian dinar], but by HRK [Croatian kuna]. Those who 
attempt to point out the harmfulness of this decision of his, 
that is, to change the name of the Croatian kruna [crown], which 
had previously been adopted by vote, to the kuna, he simply 
calls enemies and traitors, because "the kuna will be the proof 
of Croatian sovereignty and the stability of the Croatian 
economy. Croatia had a leadership with a clear objective in 
which the people believed." 
<H5>  The Croatian Jesus </H5>
  What is done is done, and for the present, unfortunately, 
there is nothing more that can be changed: The German mark [DM] 
will be 3.7 kunas, and this dangerous little animal will be 
divided into a smaller unit--the lipa [linden]. But in addition 
to the crucial issue of the name, there are a number of others. 
One is again in the sphere of history, and the other economic. 
That is, many people, after analyzing the persons and cities 
that appear on the new Croatian bank notes, have been calling 
attention to a number of illogical things, that is, a system 
which stubbornly wants to impose just one view of the Croatian 
past. On the other hand, numerous experts are wondering whether 
this is really the right time to remove three zeros and adopt 
the real currency (the HRD was temporary scrip) and whether the 
reasons are not really political and ceremonial? 
  The nine persons on the eight bank notes--according to 
many--including Banac, whom we have already cited, have an 
exceedingly pronounced semantic weight. Petar Zrinski and Krsto 
Frankopan (the 5-kuna note), Juraj Dobrila (10), Josip Jelacic 
(20), Ivan Gundulic (50), Ivan Mazuranic (100), Stjepan Radic 
(200), Marko Marulic (500), and Ante Starcevic (1,000) are all 
of them (except Radic to some extent) figures from the quite 
distant Croatian past who are supposed to demonstrate the course 
of the idea of the Croatian state. This choice demonstrates the 
need of a small state to prove itself powerful, to prove that it 
also had its great men, its bans and imperial generals, and, of 
course, its Father of the Homeland. 
  There was no place on the new bank notes for a Rudjer 
Boskovic, who until yesterday was on all the denominations of 
the temporary dinar? Not a single woman was found, but it is not 
that they could not have found an important Croatian woman. For 
example: Ivana Brlic-Mazuranic, Dora Pejacevic, Cvijeta 
Zuzoric.... Tudjman himself explained why, for instance, 
Ljudevit Gaj, or Strosmajer, Frano Supilo, or even Vladko Macek 
are not on a bank note. Demonstrating once again his incredible 
unfamiliarity with history, or, at least, his strange and 
monstrous interpretation of it, in a ceremonial interview with 
the editors in chief of the Croatian media (but chosen by him) 
he nervously declared: "Who told me that they reproached us for 
not having put Gaj or Strosmajer on the new bank notes? All we 
need is to do more to spread Illyrianism and Yugoslavism." 
<H5>  The Front and the Back of the Coin </H5>
  One can only imagine what the "Croatian Jesus" would answer 
to the question of why there is no Miroslav Krleza, August 
Cesarac, or Nikola Tesla on the kunas (although they would 
probably turn in their graves because of the name). Tudjman has 
proven for the umpteenth time that he is not bound by the 
Croatian Constitution nor by the program of his pseudoparty. 
After all, the Constitution clearly states that among other 
things Croatian statehood is based "on establishment of the 
foundations of state sovereignty in the period of World War II, 
expressed contrary to proclamation of the Independent State of 
Croatia [NDH], in decisions of ZAVNOH [Regional Antifascist 
Council of the National Liberation of Croatia], and then in the 
constitution of the People's Republic of Croatia, and in the 
constitutions of the Socialist Republic of Croatia." And in the 
program of the HDZ [Croatian Democratic Union] it is written 
that it is also based on the spadework done by the Croatian left. 
  On the back of the bank note are the city of Varazdin, the 
arena in Pula, the Vukovar pigeon, Dubrovnik, the Rijeka 
Cathedral, Osijek, Diocletian's Palace in Split, and Zagreb--the 
Cathedral and the Monument to King Tomislav. The justification 
offered for this decision has to do with Croatian geography; 
that is, the four largest cities and four cities on the outer 
edge are represented. At first glance this "holds water," but 
again it is a question of the same criteria, only this time they 
are a bit more confused, since what are the Arena and 
Diocletian's Palace doing here anyway? And if the creators of 
the kuna had taken some other criterion except for 
monumentality, whereby they repeated the mistake they made in 
choosing the people, perhaps the Holy Cross in Nin, Saint Donat 
in Zadar, Viseslav's sacristy (which up to now has been on all 
the dinar scrip), and even Knin (how sacrilegious it sounds) 
might have turned up on one of the bank notes, because the 
Croatian Government is thus obstinately repeating that Knin is 
an old royal city? The front and the back of the Croatian kunas 
have actually exposed the mindset of the Croatian ruler, which, 
incidentally, he was not concealing even the other day when he 
appeared in a military uniform for the first time in public, 
which is probably the first step toward self-proclamation as 
general or generalissimo, and when he turned medieval Medvedgrad 
into some Altar of Croatian Freedom known only to him. But if 
the Croats had to once again swallow the dumpling which Tudjman 
thrust upon them, many are wondering what they have got in 
economic terms with the kuna and the lipas? Croatian Prime 
Minister Nikica Valentic, who is still declaring unlimited 
loyalty to Tudjman and has not wondered for a moment whether the 
kuna should be inaugurated right now, also had this to say a few 
days ago: "The real problems and the wave of bankruptcies that 
will be coming soon will affect entire branches of the economy, 
because the structure of the economy which Croatia has today is 
not tenable. Only now will we see whether we have the strength 
and will to carry out the anti-inflation program on which 
cooperation with international financial institutions depends." 
<H5>  Political Decision </H5>
  Up to now, the Croatian Government has boasted disdainfully 
how it has managed to halt inflation, and when recently its 
deputy prime minister was advised that this is a simple 
operation, he replied: "Well, if it is simple, why didn't others 
do it?" The creator of the "Croatian economic miracle" seems to 
have forgotten that even a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where 
inflation was measured in millions of percentage points, managed 
to achieve domestic convertibility in just one day. Many 
economic indicators warn that the Croatian economy has no chance 
of that kind of rapid recovery and that up to now the government 
has only carried out the anti-inflation program, but it has not 
even begun the stabilization program, as Valentic himself has 
declared so clearly. This is best indicated by the figures on 
the drastic decline of industrial output, the drop in exports 
and imports, and the deficit amounting to about $100 million.... 
Dr. Vladimir Veselica, member of the HDZ and a professor in the 
School of Economics at Zagreb University, recently judged that 
the "collapsing curve of economic activity, unresolved property 
relations, that is, the incomplete and highly questionable 
privatization, without whose completion there can be no 
restructuring nor development of the economy, constitute a weak 
support for real convertibility of the first sovereign Croatian 
currency." Another economist (who incidentally is a member of 
the first Croatian government, from which he withdrew because of 
his attitude toward privatization), Dr. Drazen Kalodjera, is 
still more precise: "The prerequisites have not been created for 
introduction of the kuna. I think that the change in the money 
system and denomination did not come at the right moment. This 
is a political decision which has an economically neutral 
effect." 
  Dr. Ivo Banac is convinced (nor is he alone) that Tudjman 
will again have to apologize for yet another historical 
brainstorm and invention as he did in the case of the Jews and 
what he wrote about them in his Trackless.... Ivica 
Racan, president of the Social Democratic Party of Croatia 
[SDSH], says: "The new money will sooner or later pay the price 
of this illusion concerning the great success against inflation, 
regardless of what it is called. Perhaps it is not such a bad 
thing for the odium to fall on a bank note with an inappropriate 
name."

  [Text] Knin, 23 Jun (TANJUG) -- By 1000 today the Serb 
military had considerably reduced its presence in the area of 
the village of Kakma near Benkovac, UNPROFOR [UN Protection 
Forces] representatives in Sector South stressed at a news 
conference today in Knin. They made it clear that there 
remained five armed soldiers and three to four unarmed soldiers. 
  The situation in this village, 12 kilometers south-west of 
Benkovac, which is situated within the so-called buffer zone and 
which is regarded by both sides as "a sensitive area," was 
described by the sector commander Czech General Rostislav Kotil 
and head of civilian affairs Enrico Aguillar, and press 
spokesman Alun Roberts. 
  In their words, this was a very serious violation of the 
cease-fire agreement since about 100 Serb soldiers entered the 
buffer zone without giving any notice. Roberts said that 
UNPROFOR's Canadian troops had denied neither access to the 
waterworks system nor passage through the village of Kakma, 
while military observers have not noticed any concentration of 
Croatian forces, nor have they seen any relocation of heavy 
weaponry near Biograd. He told the press that yesterday a 
member of the negotiating team, Colonel Duburg, had visited Knin 
and met General Mile Novakovic, the head of Krajina's central 
commission for the implementation of the Zagreb agreement. 
  They agreed to hold a meeting this afternoon between Gen. 
Novakovic and Bertrand de Lapresle, the UNPROFOR commander for 
the former Yugoslavia, probably in Topusko. A meeting of the 
central commission was also suggested in order to normalize the 
situation as soon as possible. 
  Sector Commander Gen. Kotil was speaking about a meeting he 
held in Kakma yesterday with Colonel Alavanja, the commander of 
the North Dalmatian Corps of the Krajina army and the commander 
of the unit that had entered Kakma. According to him, he 
suggested that mixed patrols, including UNPROFOR and the militia 
of the republic of Serb Krajina, be set up so they could patrol 
this area. He agreed that all repairs to the waterworks should 
stop. Kotil expressed satisfaction with the latest improved 
situation and stressed that he understood how sensitive the 
Kakma area was, given the fact that it supplied water to a 
number of towns. 
  Asked by a reporter whether UNPROFOR would withdraw its 
armored carriers from this area -- at the moment there are as 
many as 25 of them [carriers] -- he said that it was too early 
to talk about UNPROFOR's further activities but he could not 
accept any claim that UNPROFOR forces occupied Serbian villages.

  [Text] Knin, 22 Jun (TANJUG) -- Members of the Serbian army 
of Krajina returned to positions in the area of the village of 
Kakma near Benkovac, along the Croatian-Krajina separation line, 
an area that has been designated by the Zagreb agreement as 
being within the zone of separation. 
  This was also confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Marinko Gajic, 
deputy commander of the Serbian army of Krajina, who explained 
the move as a measure of caution against increased Croatian 
threats to the effect that they would forcibly capture the water 
springs in this village. The source supplying Benkovac with 
water has been controlled by the Serbian army of Krajina until 
recently, but became part of the so-called zone of separation in 
accordance with the Zagreb agreement. This area is now under 
the jurisdiction of UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] Canadian 
battalion. Allan Roberts, spokesman for Sector South, told 
TANJUG's correspondent that the situation is being assessed 
"very carefully," and that consultations are being conducted at 
the moment, "so nothing specific can be said."

  [Text] The situation with Serbian troops stationed on the 
Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
territory near Kriva Palanka is in a status quo. The two 
countries' soldiers are positioned only few hundred meters away 
from each other. There are no incidents and the region is 
regularly flown over by UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] 
helicopters. The anxiety of the local population loosens, but 
farmers are prevented from cultivating their land as it is on 
the territory presently usurped by Serbian troops.

  [Text] Although the census entered its 3rd day, Albanian 
census clerks are still not doing their part of the job in some 
cities (Kumanovo, Kicevo, Debar). The census has also not yet 
started in the part of Makedonski Brod, inhabited by the 
Macedonian Muslims and the Turks. The situation in Tetovo is 
the same despite the fact that all preparations are completed, 
because of Article 30 of the Census Law. The census in Gostivar 
has also not begun although the training of census clerks has. 
The operation in Debar did start but the census committees 
asked for a delay. In parts of the Skopje central settlement 
inhabited by heterogeneous populations, census clerks refuse to 
go in twos. In all remaining cities, the census operation is 
carried out normally. 
  Meanwhile, representatives of PDP [the Party of Democratic 
Prosperity] and the Albanian Liberal Alliance-Democratic Party 
met with the Council of Europe's experts in parliament 
yesterday. The resident of the expert team (Verner Haug) stated 
there were no objective reasons to boycott the census and 
parties refusing to take part in it would have to take on the 
entire responsibility, regardless of their reasons. As for 
demands by Albanian parties for postponement of the end 
deadline, he said it might be a solution for overcoming all 
current problems. He pointed out it would be better to have a 
little longer-lasting census than to have no census at all. 
However, he stressed this was only a suggestion on which the 
Macedonian Government and parliament will have to bring a final 
decision about.

  [Text] We have just learned unofficially that Justice 
Minister Miha Kozinc has offered his resignation to Prime 
Minister Dr. Janez Drnovsek because of the affair with the 
government housing loans, issued under favorable conditions. 
His action is not in response to the opposition party demands 
that have accompanied the outbreak of the affair, since the 
justice minister allegedly offered his resignation on Monday [20 
June], immediately after the publication of the names of the 
recipients of loans. 
  There have been many pressures for his replacement in the 
past, however, none of these demands referred to his work as 
justice minister. It is not known yet whether Prime Minister 
Janez Drnovsek will accept his resignation. Last night Drnovsek 
merely stated that he would demand a report from the incumbent 
service and resort to replacements if need be.

    [Editorial Report] A 7 June meeting in Zagreb between 
Slovene President Milan Kucan and Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman on bilateral issues has been the subject of much 
discussion in the Slovene and Croatian press. 
  The 9 June issue of the Ljubljana independent daily DELO 
reported that the day after his return from Zagreb, Kucan told 
reporters at a Ljubljana news conference that his visit had been 
"useful" and that he had achieved his "goal" -- to give impetus 
to Slovene-Croatian negotiations on unresolved bilateral issues, 
which range from border disputes to stagnating economic 
relations. Although the presidents did not try to find 
"concrete" solutions to the specific problems, Kucan mentioned 
as particularly aggravating issues the Piran Bay dispute and 
deteriorating trade relations. He said that the best solution 
would be to compromise or, absent an agreement, accept the 
status quo. The worst possible option, in his opinion, would be 
"to ignore the problems" or "force unilateral solutions." He 
remarked that he was not "completely convinced" that the Slovene 
Government was aware of the importance of Slovenia's relations 
with its neighbor or that it had formulated a strategy for 
dealing with the unresolved issues. 
  Kucan stressed the importance of Croatian Prime Minister 
Nikica Valentic's scheduled July visit to Ljubljana, during 
which he and his Slovene counterpart Janez Drnovsek will 
probably tackle the major problems: the border in the Piran Bay, 
the construction of the Phyrn highway, the Ljubljanska Banka's 
debt to Croatian depositors, numerous property claims by 
nationals of both countries, the Krsko nuclear power plant, and 
the trade decline. In Kucan's view, the upcoming 
Slovene-Croatian talks should be guided by the following 
principles: to seek "just" and "mutually satisfying" solutions 
and to respect the "equality" of the two partners. Kucan 
expressed willingness to take part in formulating the Slovene 
positions in preparation for the July meeting, DELO reported. 
  In the same issue of DELO, commentator Veso Stojanov 
assessed 
Kucan's meeting with Tudjman as "above all, a useful exchange of 
opinions" on how to get Slovene-Croatian relations out of their 
dead-end street. While he agreed with the official statements 
that the normalization of relations is "of vital interest to 
both countries," Stojanov suspected that "threats from Rome" 
against both countries also played a part in the talks, since it 
is important for Slovenia and Croatia to formulate a joint 
strategy toward Italy. Stojanov noted that the approach of the 
tourist season makes it especially urgent for Croatia that 
tensions be removed. At the same time, he criticized the Slovene 
Government, especially the Foreign Ministry, for lacking a 
foreign policy strategy, reflected in "complete indifference" 
toward solving the problems with Croatia. 
  In an earlier commentary published in the 8 June DELO, 
Stojanov questioned whether Kucan's unofficial visit to Croatia 
would contribute to better cooperation, while agreeing with 
Tudjman's and Kucan's statements that the present relations 
between Slovenia and Croatia "do not suit the interests of 
either state." Stojanov pointed out that the short history of 
Slovene-Croatian relations "is full of meetings and negotiations 
at different levels -- disputed issues, however, remain 
unresolved." Stojanov blamed the impasse mostly on a "lack of 
interest by the neighbors or their nonobservance of agreements 
and promises." In his opinion, the talks can be judged 
successful only when "Zagreb, in fact, shows a readiness to 
normalize relations with Ljubljana." 
  A commentary in the 8 June issue of the Maribor (Slovenia) 
daily VECER stated that President Kucan had to show "firmness" 
in his talks with President Tudjman because Slovene foreign 
policy toward Croatia had been "by and large unsuccessful," 
resulting in quarrels and finger-pointing on the Slovene 
domestic political scene. An important new development pointed 
out by the commentator is the fact that, from now on, Slovenia 
will not "stand by idly" if Croatia attempts to "further 
complicate already serious problems," as Kucan, according to 
VECER, told Tudjman, who has the final say in Croatia. 
  The 9 June issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK noted the good 
will of both sides toward solving Slovene-Croatia problems, "if 
not out of great love," then out of common political and 
economic interests, among which VJESNIK listed the wish of both 
countries to be integrated into the European Union and a 
perceived common threat from Italy regarding Istria. The 
announced visit to Slovenia by Prime Minister Valentic was 
viewed by VJESNIK as a step toward improving Croat-Slovene 
relations. 
  The independent Rijeka daily NOVI LIST, in its 9 June issue, 
was critical of both sides, for extolling their own virtues and 
arguing over a "dry river bed," forgetting that they both live 
in the shadow of Italy, "an unpredictable neighbor." 
  The 8 June issue of the Split daily SLOBODNA DALMACIJA 
predicted that the "two presidents will not find any concrete 
solutions," not only because the Slovene president has less 
authority to negotiate than his Croatian counterpart but also 
because Slovene-Croatian relations have been neglected and 
stalled by both sides for a long time. The paper said it would 
consider the meeting a success if both sides expressed a 
willingness "to resolve the problems," such as the border and 
property issues, and "to create a good atmosphere," which would 
then lead to meetings of expert groups and meetings between 
Valentic and his Slovene counterpart, Janez Drnovsek.

  [Text] New York, June 23 (TANJUG) -- Albanian police have 
injured several men, women and children in attempts forcibly to 
resettle the Serb and Montenegrin population from the villages 
Startlad and Boric on the Albanian border with the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, warned a protest by the Yugoslav Foreign 
Ministry which was sent on this occasion to United Nations 
(U.N.) Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  The protest was circulated as an official U.N. document on 
Thursday [23 June]. 
  The document, which was presented by Yugoslav Ambassador to 
the U.N. Dragomir Djokic, said that members of the Serb and 
Montenegrin peoples, whose native country is Yugoslavia, are 
being forcibly moved from the Albania-Yugoslavia border area. 
Such actions by the Albanian authorities are a gross violation 
of human and civil rights -- the right to physical integrity, 
choice of place of residence and the inviolablity of personal 
and private property, said the protest. 
  The Yugoslav ministry assesssed that this is a deliberately 
conceived policy aimed at breaking up the ethnic compactness of 
Serbs and Montenegrins in Albania, especially in territories 
towards the Yugoslav-Albanian border. Such actions by [word 
indistinct] contrary to its obligations stemming from its 
membership in tha U.N. and the Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), said the protest. The Yugoslav 
Government urges the Albanian authorities to stop this forcible 
resettling of Serbs and Montenegrins and to respect the rights 
of national minorities in agreement with their obligations and 
relevant CSCE documents.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 22 (TANJUG) -- Not a single ethnic 
Albanian has applied for state secondary school entry exams, 
according to Zika Nedeljkovic, Serbian Education Ministry 
official in Kosovo and Metohija. Nedeljkovic told the Belgrade 
daily POLITIKA EKSPRES on Wednesday [22 June] that, `We are 
aware that extra-legal exams are being held for ethnic Albanian 
secondary school pupils, with enrollment probably taking place 
in private homes.' 
  This is the third year that ethnic Albanians have boycotted 
state secondary schools, even though classes in Albanian have 
been organized for 12,500 pupils and in Turkish for 240 pupils, 
the daily said. There has been a strong separatist movement 
among ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo 
and Metohija for decades. Leaders of the movement demand the 
annexation of the province by neighbouring Albania. 
  Ethnic Albanians backing the separatist movement boycott the 
laws of Serbia and Yugoslavia, refusing to go to school, to work 
or to pay taxes. They did not vote in the 1990 and 1992 
multiparty elections. Ethnic Albanian students boycott school 
classes and university lectures to avoid the Serbian and 
Yugoslav school curriculum. They attend illegal classes in 
private homes and use the curriculum of neighbouring Albania. 
  Yugoslav and Serbian officials have unsuccessfully appealed 
to ethnic Albanian intellectuals in the provice to oppose the 
separatists and to support a return to state schools. The 
result is that generations of ethnic Albanians are unable to 
find work because they have not obtained secondary school 
certificates. The Yugoslav Constitution guarantees civil rights 
regardless of ethnic origin. Ethnic Albanians can attend 
classes and lectures in Albanian and have newspapers, magazines, 
radio and tv programmes in Albanian. 
  There are 1,400 schools for ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and 
Metohija, 60 education centres and university lectures are 
offered in Albanian.

  [Text] Brussels, June 23 (CTK) -- On the eve of the 
European Union (EU) summit in Corfu, Czech Minister of Industry 
and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy visited the European Union Commission 
today. 
  He talked to the Commission's Deputy Chairman Henning 
Christophersen and the Commissary for External Economic Relation 
Leon Brittan. 
  He told both of them about the economic situation in the 
Czech Republic, giving them the latest information from the 
statistical office of a 3.5 per cent growth in the gross 
national product, and gave them details of the progress of 
privatization. 
  Pavel Telicka from the Czech EU delegation said 
Christophersen had told Dlouhy the Czech Republic's approach of 
firs privatizing state companies and leaving their 
restructuralization until later was the right one. Christopher 
added that in countries which had proceeded in the opposite way, 
privatization had not brought the results expected. 
  Dlouhy discussed specific questions concerning preparations 
for EU membership, both from the point of view of the Czech 
Republic and that of the EU. Christophersen assured him that the 
EU was interested in Czech membership and that it was now 
analyzing questions connected with the further expansion of the 
Union. 
  With Brittan, Dlouhy discussed problems hindering trade 
between the Czech Republic and the EU, and the rules of fair 
economic competition. He pointed out to Brittan that the latest 
anti-dumping investigations to be started by EU bodies with 
regard to the export of Czech cement and foundry iron were 
entirely ungrounded. He also said that although the Czech 
Republic could not be shown to be carrying out a policy of 
dumping, the very fact that investigations had been started 
would do Czech companies economic damage. He therefore turned 
to Brittan with a request for the reviewing of the EU 
Commission's anti-dumping practice. 
  Brittan replied that he was already looking into the 
question 
of anti-dumping proceedings against countries of Central and 
Eastern Europe. He pointed to the necessity of compatibility 
between the Czech Republic's policy of economic competition and 
the rules of economic competition in the EU, saying that these 
policies had to be transparent. In the rest of the discussion 
Brittan expressed interest in how the Czech Republic dealt with 
the question of bankruptcies.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prince Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of Czech </F>
President Havel's Cabinet, by Xavier Gautier; place and date not 
given: "The `Good Intentions' of the Balladur Plan"] 
  [Text] Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of President Vaclav 
Havel's personal Cabinet since 1989 and heir to a long line of 
Austro-Hungarian prince-diplomats, remains, one year after the 
partitioning of Czechoslovakia, the closest adviser to the 
father of the "Velvet Revolution." Now living in Prague, this 
Vienna-educated prince is one of the most committed spokesmen 
voicing the hopes and frustrations of Central Europe with regard 
to Brussels' partial opening up to the new democracies. 
  [Gautier] What are your views on the Conference on Stability 
that opens today in Paris and that will attempt to solve the 
problems of good-neighborliness between the countries of Central 
Europe? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Can you imagine a roundtable organized in 
Biscay, in the French Basque country, organized so that France, 
Spain, Ireland, and Britain could discuss the Basque and Irish 
problems under the benevolent supervision of the Czechs and the 
Americans? No? Neither can I. 
  [Gautier] But doesn't the "Balladur plan" provide the new 
democracies with a forum to talk about their problems? 
  [Schwarzenberg] All this reminds me of the story concerning 
my great grandfather, a very wise man who lived in the last 
century. One day he was introduced to some very pretty girls 
with the aim of getting him to marry one of them. "She is 
superb," he said, "she will be perfect for my best friend." 
Well, Mr. Balladur's plan is doubtless superb, but it is solely 
suited to his best friend. 
  [Gautier] Seen from Prague, does this conference appear 
destined to fail? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Let me return to my hypothetical "Biscay" 
roundtable. If it were a roundtable, we would have had to 
prepare for the Conference on Stability in Europe to get down to 
some long-term work, especially because by exposing our intimate 
problems for all the world to see we risk opening a new 
Pandora's box. The founding fathers of the "Stability Pact" do 
not have solid experience of the problems in our part of Europe. 
  [Gautier] France and its European neighbors have not, 
however, spared any efforts to understand the situation in 
Central Europe. 
  [Schwarzenberg] Karl Kraus, the Austrian author of Last 
Days of Humanity, once wrote: "Good intentions are the 
opposite of good politics."[.sup]1[/] 
  I think that this conference was put together by bureaucrats 
who had plenty of good intentions but whose spirit was too 
Cartesian. The Europeans will soon run up against prejudices 
that are deeply rooted in the spirits of their interlocutors. 
In our part of the world, resentment goes way back in history. 
  [Gautier] In this connection, the Czech Republic, the United 
States, and even Moscow have been asked to play a mediating role 
at this conference. Is that not the beginning of a good idea? 
  [Schwarzenberg] In a pinch, the Baltic problem could be 
compared to the Basque problem. However, if the Russian 
Federation sits down at the negotiating table as a mediator--and 
what other role could it play?--it will run into opposition from 
the Baltic countries, which is understandable. 
  [Gautier] Is not your pessimism out of place when one 
observes the way in which Europe successfully offered a status 
to South Tyrol, which is disputed by Austria and Italy? 
  [Schwarzenberg] Of course, but the issue of South Tyrol was 
limited. It demanded the commitment of two neighbors, both 
members of the European Community [as published]. 
  [Gautier] What do you think the chances are of saving the 
Paris Conference? 
  [Schwarzenberg] The kind of problem the conference is 
studying cannot be resolved with great pomp. France cites the 
example of the Madrid conference on the Middle East, but Madrid 
did not yield anything. Only the Oslo negotiations, which were 
held in secret and spread out over two years, resulted in the 
agreements on Jericho and Gaza. 
  [Gautier] Speaking of your Slovak neighbor, the problem of 
the Hungarian minority seemed like a riddle a month ago. Yet, 
Jozef Moravcik, the new prime minister, has just submitted a 
bill protecting minority rights, without the help of the 
Europeans. What does Prague think about that? 
  [Schwarzenberg] The new government in Bratislava has, thank 
God, taken the exact opposite course of its predecessor's 
policies. It has decided to tackle the problems of minorities in 
a pragmatic way. The Slovak Government now needs support not 
just from its neighbors, but also from Europe as a whole.

Austro-Hungarian government early in this century.

<F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(gag)": "We Did Not Deliver Tanks to </F>
Pakistan"] 
  [Text] Prague/Stockholm--The $0.5 billion that, according 
to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), 
the Czech Republic was supposed to have made in arms exports 
last year corresponds to the 1986 boom in Czechoslovak arms 
exports. Never before--or since--had we achieved such a large 
turnover. 
  The Czech Trade and Industry Ministry says that the value of 
the realized contracts in arms exports in 1993 amounted to $167 
million. Stanislav Fritzl, an employee in its licensing 
administration, told us that the general analyses conducted by 
the Stockholm institute are renowned; however, there are 
inconsistencies between its figures and the figures of the 
countries that export arms. The same institute stated recently 
that we exported tanks to Pakistan, although only an informative 
meeting on the possibility of supplying them had been held. The 
contract fell through in the end. "If, in their analysis of 
Czech arms exports, the Swedes applied the same method, 
incorporating deliveries that were not made or even the 
tentative contacts made by manufacturers, I am not surprised at 
the difference between their and our figures," said Fritzl. 
According to him, the Czech Trade and Industry Ministry will ask 
the Stockholm institute to reveal how it reached the sum of $0.5 
billion. The Czech Republic is an important exporter of small 
arms (Czech Arms Plants Uhersky Brod) and jet training aircraft 
(Aero Vodochody), while the Vlasim-based Sellier and Bellot or 
Tatra Koprivnice, whose once ambitious military production is 
being phased out, however, are among the companies with good 
prospects. 
  Stanislav Fritzl told us that the Czech Republic is no 
longer 
viewed by the West as an armed-to-the-teeth opponent; 
nevertheless, it is viewed as a competent rival in the 
production of quality arms. Fritzl described as speculation the 
theory put forward by LIDOVE NOVINY that the Stockholm 
institute's report, which ranks us as the sixth-largest arms 
exporter, could be aimed at casting doubt on the Czech 
Republic's credibility. Nevertheless, he did admit that very 
tough competition, whose methods are not always clean, is taking 
place among the competing arms plants. The case involving the 
six impounded Aero Vodochody guns, in which both Aero and the 
Cechofracht forwarding company made minor mistakes, probably 
does not fall into this category. However, the Austrians could 
use these minor mistakes to seek a legal solution to the 
multimillion [currency not specified] shipment for Thailand. 
  Cechofracht and Aero agreed yesterday to end the mutual 
accusations over who is responsible for the seizure of the guns. 
The forwarding company has claimed that the guns were declared 
only as spare parts for L-59 aircraft. On the other hand, 
Aero's director has told LIDOVE NOVINY that, without the gun 
carriage, the guns are just a piece of iron comparable to a 
spare part.

    [Editorial Report] Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 
22 June on page 1 carries a 300-word "eb"-signed report entitled 
"Foreign Certificates Will Suffice as of 1 July for Imports of 
Fruit and Vegetables." According to the report, the Slovak 
Office for Normalization, Metrology, and Testing issued a decree 
on 21 June, under which, with effect from 1 July, importers of 
fruit and vegetables will no longer have to produce a quality 
certificate issued by the Slovak testing authority. The above 
decision is also the subject of a 650-word Stefan Mistrik 
commentary, entitled "Inadmissible Concession," in Bratislava 
SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 22 June on pages 1 and 4. 
  The NARODNA OBRODA report notes that, as of 1 July, Slovakia 
will recognize certificates issued by the OECD, the European 
Union [EU], or the "certification authority" accredited in the 
country from which the goods come. The Slovaks reportedly took 
this "accommodating step" on the basis of a protocol on the 
recognition of OECD certificates that was signed by Minister of 
Agriculture Koncos and the EU "at the beginning of June." 
NARODNA OBRODA notes that the previous requirement for a Slovak 
certificate "had greatly complicated and, as a result, 
drastically limited imports of fruit and vegetables, including 
those that do not grow in Slovakia or of which there is 
shortage." According to the paper, importers welcome the new 
decree as a "step that will move us closer to the practices used 
in fruit and vegetable trade in the world." 
  Stefan Mistrik opens the commentary by saying: "The Slovak 
agricultural public has the right to be enraged. On 10 June 
1994, Minister of Agriculture Pavol Koncos yielded to the 
European Union commissioner during talks on the recognition of 
OECD and EU states' certificates for imports of selected types 
of fruit and vegetables. This is an inadmissible concession, 
whose consequences for the Slovak economy are scarcely 
calculable today. We have opened wide the doors of the Slovak 
agricultural market, creating conditions for its inundation with 
imported vegetables and fruit." 
  According to Mistrik, OECD and EU certificates for the 
following items will be recognized as of 1 July: potatoes, 
tomatoes, onions, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, 
carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, bananas, citrus fruit, 
grapes, watermelons and cantaloupes, apples, pears, apricots, 
peaches, cherries, as well as nuts and frozen fruit. According 
to Mistrik, this measure will put Slovak growers at a 
disadvantage because their produce will still have to meet 
strict domestic norms. 
  Because Minister Koncos "yielded to the pressure of EU 
commissioners," Mistrik continues, "the Czechs can laugh because 
they have now achieved what they did not achieve in direct talks 
with Slovakia only a few weeks ago. What they wanted has been 
accomplished for them by EU commissioners." 
  Besides expressing concern at the "millions of korunas of 
which Slovak farmers will be deprived" as a result of the new 
decree, Mistrik is also worried about its impact on citizens' 
health: "The question arises about the place of the Slovak 
citizen in all this. His government does not protect his health. 
Last year our inspection authorities ascertained that our 
market is flooded with food that is damaging to health. In some 
cases, substandard quality goods made up 70 percent of the 
imported volume."

<F P=106> [Correspondents' report: "Laszlo Kover Will Be Head of the </F>
Fidesz Parliamentary Group Until September -- Boross To Chair 
the National Security Committee"] 
  [Text] Yesterday the parliamentary group of the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] nominated Laszlo Salamon, former deputy 
head of the MDF group in the parliament, to the position of 
chairman of the parliament's Constitutional Committee. Peter 
Nahimi has been nominated to the only parliament clerk position 
the MDF can fill. Peter Boross, departing prime minister, has 
been nominated to the position of chairman of the parliament's 
National Security Committee. The MDF also obtained a chairman 
position in the Budget Committee: Bela Kadar, former minister 
of International Economic Relations, will chair this committee. 
  According to the six-party agreement, the MDF is entitled to 
four deputy committee chairman positions. Thus, the position of 
deputy chairman of the Constitutional Committee will be filled 
by Katalin Kutrucz, a former member of the committee; Gyorgy 
Csoti will become deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee; the position of deputy chairman of the Cultural 
Committee will be filled by the previous chairman Attila 
Zsigmond, and departing minister of Transportation Gyorgy 
Schamschula will be the deputy chairman of the Auditing 
Committee. 
  At the founding session of the new parliamentary group of 
the 
Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] held on 22 June, Lszlo 
Kover was given the task to head the Fidesz group until 
September 1994. The deputies accepted the proposal of the party 
leadership to refrain from selecting a new parliamentary group 
head for the time being, because the upcoming Fidesz congress 
scheduled for 9 July 1994 will also be able to express its 
opinion regarding this issue. 
  After several preliminary consultations, the Fidesz 
parliamentary group decided to divide the committee positions 
given to the Fidesz. Thus, the Fidesz parliamentary group will 
nominate Janos Ader and Jozsef Szajer to the Constitutional 
Committee, Laszlo Urban and Csaba Sumeghy to the Budget 
Committee, Zoltan Rockenbauer and Zsolt Nemeth to the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Madi to the Economic 
Committee, and Tamas Deutsch and Gabriella Selmeczi to the Local 
Government Committee. Lajos Kosa and Laszlo Urban will be 
members of the Agricultural Committee, Szilard Sasvari will be a 
member of the Cultural Committee, and Gabriella Selmeczi will go 
to the Welfare Committee. Laszlo Madi will go to the Employment 
Committee, Tamas Tirts to the Human Rights Committee, Tamas 
Deutsch to the Environmental Protection Committee, Janos Ader to 
the Auditing Committee, Jozsef Szajer to the Immunity and 
Mandate Control Committee, and Laszlo Kover to the National 
Security Committee. Viktor Orban will be nominated as chairman 
of the European Affairs Committee, and Zoltan Pokorni will be 
nominated to the deputy chairman of the Educational Committee 
position. Tamas Wachsler will be chairman of the Defense 
Committee, and Bela Gyuricza will be member of the same 
committee. Szilard Sasvari and Zoltan Trombitas will be clerks 
of the committee. 
  Laszlo Kover told us that Karoly Eperjes did not make it in 
any committee because he is sticking to his earlier statement 
that he will hand in his parliamentary deputy mandate very 
shortly, at the best possible time for the parliamentary group. 
(He will probably be replaced by Mihaly Varga, whom the Fidesz 
group wants to use as a budget expert). Szekesfehervar Mayor 
Istvan Balsay cannot exercise his rights as parliamentary deputy 
because of the incompatibility rules, so he cannot be committee 
member either. At the same time, he will accept his mandate and 
will participate in the foundation session of the new 
parliament. If the situation changes and Balsay accepts the 
parliamentary deputy position, he will probably get into the 
Local Government Committee. 
  Both the parliamentary group deputy heads and the new heads 
will be elected at the end of this summer. Laszlo Kover and 
Jozsef Szajer will be nominated to the respective positions. 
However, Jozsef Szajer has not yet decided whether he will 
accept the nomination or not.

  ``Minister! 
  ``Polish diplomacy yesterday became the object of a dramatic 
political debate. Many people who have served the Republic well 
and with devotion must today feel bitter and disoriented; can 
they continue to act in the name of the Republic? Can they

  ``I ask that at this difficult moment you assure these

<F P=106> [Report by Kenan Ekic and Zoran Babic report on speech by </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly in Sarajevo on 23 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] At its session yesterday, the Presidency of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina decided to propose to the 
Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to elect Haris 
Silajdzic as head of the new joint government of the Assembly of 
the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, the second day of the assembly 
session (?was characterized) by Dr. Silajdzic's speech on the 
basic principles of the new government's tasks. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] I would like to stress that the 
government should have a unified program concept, regardless of 
the fact that it has a double role. There are no strategic 
differences concerning the political aims of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina that 
would require different program principles. The Federation is 
based on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, therefore, the preservation 
of sovereignty [word indistinct] aim that determines the unified 
direction of the action of all republican and federal 
authorities. This is also a strategic aim of the program and 
[words indistinct], whose verification will be decided on by 
this assembly. 
  I believe that in this respect we have a consensus, not only 
of the Bosniak and Croatian people, but also of all the citizens 
who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina to be [words indistinct]. In 
addition to the unity on this vital aim, it is also very 
important to have a unified view on the means with which we 
intend to accomplish this aim. 
  I believe it is undisputable that we have decided to achieve 
this primarily in a peaceful way and with political means. 
Setting up the federation itself confirms that approach. We 
have invested much effort to find qualitatively new solutions 
that will secure full national equality, democratic relations, 
and the highest standards of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
This concept is determined by the Constitution of the 
Federation and it is already demonstrating its effectiveness on 
the ground with the majority Bosniak [words indistinct]. After 
the signing of the Washington agreements, the fighting in the 
region stopped within a very short period of time, and processes 
leading toward the establishment of a lasting peace have been 
started. 
  This is certainly a very important [word indistinct] in the 
direction of finding an overall peace solution to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we do not consider the 
federation to be a war coalition of two nations against the 
third, but a model of relations that offers all peoples and 
citizens an equal position within Bosnia-Herzegovina as an 
internationally recognized state. 
  This is confirmed by the positive reaction by those 
political 
forces that are also beginning to emerge increasingly within the 
ranks of the Bosnian Serbs as an expression of resistance to the 
fascist nationalism of the SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] and 
its leaders. Everyone can see what relations we are proposing 
and setting up at present. 
  The assembly that I am addressing as a Bosniak, a Muslim, 
as a (?nominal) prime minister is presided over by a Croat and a 
Serb alternately, depending on the constitutional form of the 
assembly' session. This is no coincidence. This is a real 
expression of a political project that we are promoting and 
offering. 
  We believe that the federation is a project that has a 
future, a project that will sooner or later be, not imposed, but 
accepted and established throughout the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Therefore, we are very clearly expressing 
our commitment to finding political solutions in a peaceful way, 
political solutions that will justly satisfy the interests of 
all the nations in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a commitment 
that the government will firmly pursue at home and abroad. [end 
recording] 
  [Reporter] However, considering that the aggressor is still 
obstructing the peace initiatives, the international community 
must determine the sanctions for the aggressor and the 
guarantees for the implementation of the peace plans. The new 
government will consider [words indistinct] one of the priority 
tasks in its work. 
  [Begin Silajdzic recording] With the signing of the 
Washington and Vienna Agreements, the adoption of the 
Constitution and the corresponding Constitutional Law, the 
election of the president and vice president, the initial phase 
of the process of setting up the federation has been completed. 
Today's decisions on appointing a reshuffled government and 
laws on the federal state administration will fully establish 
the (?instruments) of the executive authorities at the federal 
level in a way that is constitutionally regulated for the 
transitional period. 
  The necessary prerequisites have therefore been created for 
an accelerated implementation of the constitutional provisions 
and the (?organization) of the authority at the cantonal and 
communal levels. In some regions activities have already been 
started to set up communal councils and cantonal assemblies. 
With its activities, the government should present a strong 
impetus for this process to be completed throughout the 
federation as soon as possible. There are no longer any valid 
constitutional-legal or political reasons to justify delays in 
the implementation of the Constitution at all levels [words 
indistinct]. The reasons why we should speed up the setting up 
of new bodies throughout the federation are not of a formal 
nature. This is the essential prerequisite for solving in an 
organized and systematic way the enormous problems caused by the 
war in all walks of life, problems ranging from the return of 
refugees to the revitalization of the economy and the 
reestablishment of production and the financial system. 
  The constitutional position of the cantons in the federal 
system is such that they have numerous and very important duties 
that used to belong to the central authorities. These duties 
can and must be taken on only by the legal cantonal bodies, who 
will at the same time assume full responsibility for their work 
as determined by the Constitution. In that case, the government 
will indeed be able, in addition to its involvement in the peace 
process, foreign affairs, and defense, to involve itself 
maximally in work on the development of the economic system and 
economic policy, including the planning and rebuilding of the 
country, as well as regulating trade at home and with other 
countries, financial transactions at home and with other 
countries, (?setting up) the financial system, establishing 
control of the currency, creating monetary and fiscal policy, as 
well as defining energy policy. This means the inter-cantonal 
distribution of energy and the provision and maintenance of the 
necessary infrastructure. 
  It stands to reason that these issues will occupy the 
dominant place in the government's program, since these are 
areas in which the federation has exclusive jurisdiction, and 
which are by their very nature such that they mostly belong 
within the government's jurisdiction. The government will also 
-- in accordance with the jurisdiction that will be determined 
within the federal authority -- program and implement its tasks 
in the health service, social policy, communications 
infrastructure, the utilization of economic resources, and other 
areas in which the federation and the cantons have divided 
rights and responsibilities. 
  The government has to devote particular attention to the 
implementation of the constitutional regulations on human rights 
and basic [word indistinct], and -- within this -- the 
application of the right guaranteed by the Constitution for 
refugees to return to their homes is of particular importance. 
This is a problem whose solution cannot be delayed or 
conditioned by waiting for more favorable circumstances, at 
least not when it comes to territories under the control of the 
legal bodies of the republic, that is, the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a clear relationship here between 
the time that has passed and the number of people that will 
return. The longer it takes to return, the fewer will return. 
This is why it is the responsibility of all the bodies, 
including the Federal Government, to work in an organized way 
and, most important, quickly for the return of the refugees and 
displaced people. All those who do not behave accordingly can 
be considered accomplices in preserving the effects of ethnic 
cleansing. For this reason, and apart from other measures, it 
is very important that the federal courts envisaged by the 
Constitution be formed as soon as possible -- in which a certain 
number of foreign judges will participate -- and that the 
institution of the ombudsmen, the guarantors of human rights, be 
activated as soon as possible, which will initially function 
under a patronage of sorts of the CSCE. 
  The return of the refugees cannot depend solely on local 
cantonal authorities. This problem even exceeds the federal 
framework, since this is obviously a problem of international 
proportions. This means that the international community -- in 
solving this problem -- will be present both through the 
necessary financial help and through certain forms of 
institutionalized control. One such concrete step by the 
international community is the agreement by the European Union 
to administer the city of Mostar. We believe that this will 
help the [word indistinct] of this city, not only in material 
terms but also in overcoming the tensions created by the 
conflict, restoring confidence, and returning refugees. So the 
government should, within its jurisdiction, support this project 
by the European Union [words indistinct]. 
  Within this time frame for the implementation of the [word 
indistinct], I would like to mention the foreign affairs [word 
indistinct]. Why? [words indistinct] the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Government, since the federation still has no international 
legal status, and the constitutional solutions envisage that the 
federation will not engage in foreign affairs until the peace 
process is completed. 
  As for the trends in foreign policy, I think that, in 
essence, the policy so far will be continued, with possible 
corrections as determined by developments, both external and 
internal. At the moment, however, there are no significant 
reasons for any radical changes in foreign or domestic policy.

<F P=106> [Speech by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman on Croatian Day </F>
of Antifascists in Pazin, Istria--live relay] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen; Croats; all citizens of 
Pazin, Istria and all other Croatian areas; you who came here of 
your own free will; and refugees who came because of their 
misfortune. Today we mark an official holiday in Croatia, to 
honor Croatian antifascism. This day has a special meaning for 
all of Croatia, and particularly for Istria. On this day, 
democratic and sovereign Croatia shows that the antifascist 
struggle is one of its foundations. In this antifascist 
struggle, in the difficult and crucial days of World War II, 
Croatian patriots helped preserve the Croatian nation and create 
a democratic, independent, and sovereign Croatian state. 
  This day was forgotten in former socialist Yugoslavia and in 
socialist Croatia when it was part of Yugoslavia--in other 
words, it was falsified. Instead of marking 22 June, when in 
1941 Croatian antifascists began their struggle against fascism, 
it was a struggle for a Croatian state and not for a Yugoslav 
state. Instead, authorities of socialist Croatia proclaimed 27 
July as the day of antifascist uprising, the day when Serbs from 
Bosnia and Knin began fighting against the Independent State of 
Croatia [NDH, Nezavisna Drzava Hrvatska]. The Serbs from Bosnia 
and Croatia fought not because the NDH was linked with fascist 
Italy and Germany but because it wanted to be Croatian. Serbs 
and Chetniks from Knin were those who established links with 
fascist Italy, and they would do the same today if they could. 
  Therefore, the current democratic and sovereign Croatia was 
the one which set the matter straight as it will do with 
everything else in Istria and the Croatian nation. [applause] 
  I happened to know, or shall I say, I was honored to know, 
personally the man who on 22 June 1941 led 40 Croatian 
communists from Sisak to the forest of Brezovica, thus starting 
the antifascist struggle in Croatia. This struggle was against 
fascism but also, as I said, for a free Croatia. It was Vlado 
Janic, nicknamed Capo, a Croatian man, a Croatian worker, a 
communist, but nonetheless a man who knew by heart the main 
ideas of Antun Starcevic [19th century Croatian intellectual] 
and the Radic brothers, Antun and Stjepan Radic [prewar 
political leaders championing Croatian independence], a man who 
[interupted by applause] fought that antifascist war in Croatia 
with this idea of an all-Croat struggle. In Belgrade he was the 
one who ordered the arrest of Punisa Racic, the man who murdered 
the Croatian leader Stjepan Radic in the parliament in Belgrade, 
and brought him to justice. 
  This is what is essential in Croatian antifascism, and this 
is what we are accordingly going to pay deserved tribute to, as 
an integral part of the Croatian people's struggle for freedom. 
[applause] Viewed as a whole, this antifascist struggle by 
Croatia was one of the greatest, not only within the confines of 
the countries of the former Yugoslavia but in Europe, as well. 
There is no truth in all those stories, which were meant to 
fool both the Croatian and the international public, according 
to which this partisan, national liberation struggle in Croatia 
was a Serbian struggle alone. In the partisan antifascist 
movement--in Croatia's partisan army--Croatians accounted for 
over 60 percent. There were 28 percent of Serbs and all the 
other nationalities, including Italians, Hungarians, and even 
Germans and Ruthenians. 
  Hence, the armed force of Croatia's antifascist struggle was 
Croatian. Understandably, a higher proportion of Serbs than 
Croats took part in it because the Croats had been truly divided 
in that period when battles of global proportions were being 
waged between the antifascist coalition and the axis forces. 
The leadership of the antifascist struggle in Croatia was in 
Croatian hands. At the helm of this antifascist struggle in 
Croatia was Andrija Hebrang, a Croatian communist but also a 
Croatian patriot. There was also the Croatian poet Vladimir 
Nazor, who worked here in Istria. It is here where he wrote his 
beautiful poetry in the Istrian dialect. 
  After all, there is nothing accidental in the life of a 
people or a movement. If we say that Croatian patriots, such as 
those I have just mentioned, were at the forefront of Croatia's 
antifascist struggle, then we should also mention that it was 
also Croats who led the antifascist struggle across all of 
Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito was a communist, but he was a 
Croat, too. Ivan Ribar [Croatian communist killed during World 
War II], was at the helm of the AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of 
the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia]. He was a Croat, too. 
[applause] 
  In that leadership of the antifascist struggle of both 
Croatia and Yugoslavia, prominent positions were also held by 
the representatives of Istria, representatives who favored the 
Croatian character of Istria and who fought for the survival of 
the Croatian identity in Istria and for having Istria as an 
integral part of Croatia. [applause] 
  It seems that even you in Istria have forgotten that Ante 
Mandic was also one of the most distinguished and well-known 
people of this kind. During the First World War, he was the man 
who advocated the unification of all Croatian lands and their 
liberation from Italian occupation. He was on the Yugoslav 
Council during the First World War. In the Second World War he 
joined the antifascist struggle here in Opatija. Later he 
became a ZAVNOH [National Antifascist Council for the National 
Liberation of Croatia] deputy and a deputy of the AVNOJ. As a 
well-known democrat he was even a royal deputy at the time the 
Karadjordjevic dynasty was ousted and federal Yugoslavia was 
established. 
  Hence, Istria has contributed its share to the leadership of 
the antifascist struggle. This antifascist struggle was of 
particular importance to Istria because the antifascist struggle 
[pauses].... not only in Istria, for if there had been only that 
which could have survived as antifascist in Istria then Istria 
would not have survived as being Croatian as it would have been 
subjected to the Italian fascists and the German Nazis. 
[sentence as heard] Istria could have survived at that time, and 
it can survive today, but only as an integral part of Croatia. 
Those who [interrupted by applause, pauses].... And this is one 
of the reasons why [applause] the state holiday devoted to the 
antifascist struggle is celebrated here in Istria. We are also 
celebrating this date because the antifascist struggle waged by 
the Croatian people as a whole enabled Istria to become reunited 
with mother Croatia--not only Istria, but Rijeka, Zadar, and the 
Adriatic islands as well. This antifascist struggle enabled 
Croatia to become a constituent part of the global democratic 
coalition and, on the basis of this, to gain the right to build 
its independence and sovereignty, to become a recognized member 
of the international community. 
  The celebration of antifascism in Istria should also be 
marked so as to recall that all that Istria went through before 
was the worst tragedy for Croatian national consciousness and 
the Croatian nation. Many have forgotten this. They are even 
promising Istria some kind of better days. If this is so, let 
us recall what has been happening to Istria in the recent past, 
since World War I, from the London Treaty to the Rapallo Treaty, 
since the time the European imperialists wanted to settle their 
accounts and imperialist divisions by using Croatia and Croatian 
lands. 
  Following World War I, at the time of the disintegration of 
the Hapsburg monarchy, genuine Croatian patriots were advocating 
Croatia's unification with Serbia and other south Slav lands, 
not so much because of illusions but because of practical 
political interests and needs, in order to prevent the 
implementation of the London Treaty by which the European powers 
promised not only Istria but also Dalmatia to Italy, and, if 
unification did not materialize, Slavonia and Bosnia to Serbia. 
Therefore, Croatian patriots--those from Istria as well, people 
like Ante Mandic--were thinking of ways to prevent the disaster 
from occurring. This was accomplished through the creation of 
the new state. Dalmatia did not become part of Italy, Slavonia 
and Bosnia were not taken away from Croatia, but Istria remained 
under Italian occupation. And what happened? Members of other 
nations comprising the Hapsburg monarchy were immediately 
released from internment camps, but not Istrian Croats and 
Slovenes. They remained imprisoned. What ensued was a lurid 
time for the Croatian people in Istria. The Italian occupation 
authorities began persecuting everybody, from the common folk to 
the most influential people, from the peasants and laborers, 
teachers and priests to everything that had meant something 
among the people. [sentence as heard] 
  Under the pretext that they were looking for weapons, the 
Italian carabinieri were searching Croatian homes, stealing all 
valuable objects, and setting Croatian homes on fire. For 
instance, in Krnica in 1921 fascists killed two peasants and 
locked up 89, set 26 houses on fire, and looted the area. This 
unbearable situation led to the well-known uprising of miners in 
Labin in 1921, and on 28 February 1921 the Labin republic was 
proclaimed. The reasons for this were not just social and [word 
indistinct] but also national. 
  The main witchhunt continued against all those who kept the 
Croatian spirit alive in Istria, above all against teachers and 
priests. It is estimated that in the first days of Italian rule 
about 2,000 public workers were interned in Sardinia and Lipari 
near Trieste. Many were expelled from Istria, and their places 
were taken by Italians, including village sisters, teachers, and 
others. A (?Krk) bishop (?Mandic) was imprisoned, and Andrija 
Karlin from Trieste was expelled. In Italy in 1919 35 Croatian 
priests were interned, and 23 priests were imprisoned. One 
hundred and eight priests and 180 lay priests were expelled 
across the border, and 15 [word indistinct] convents were closed 
down. 
  Most serious crimes were committed during the elections of 
1921. Even when it was not an entirely fascist state Croatia 
took advantage of the fascist movement, giving it financial and 
moral support. This movement and its paramilitary formations, 
the Black Shirts, used all methods of terror: beating, 
intimidation, and preventing the expression of Croatian national 
consciousness. Decrees of 1923 to 1927 changed Croatian names 
and surnames, as well as names of places, to Italian ones. One 
decree even banned what they called ridiculous non-Italian names. 
  Gentlemen, try to recall these times and how important it 
was, despite all of this, to preserve the Croatian 
consciousness, but only through links with the Croatian state 
and not through a desire to separate Istria from Croatia. 
[applause] 
  In these years the majority of Croatian and Slovene schools 
in the Slovene part were banned. The Italian language was 
introduced as a mandatory subject in (?382) schools. Italian 
teachers were brought in and the Croatian ones expelled. In the 
Croatian part of the Koper district alone seven Croatian schools 
either came under Italian administration or were shut down. The 
same fate was shared by 19 schools in the Pazin district, 34 in 
the Pula district and all but two in Porec district. All 
Croatian papers, newspapers, and books were banned. Of all the 
writings in Croatian only the book of prayers remained: Our 
Father, Thy will be done. This will is sometimes under duress 
but it will be done by the being that is the essence of all 
Croats. [sentence as heard] 
  The abolition of all Croatian educational, economic, [word 
indistinct], and sports associations, the abolition of all 
organizations, led to the Italianization and de-Croatization of 
Istria. Fascist terror in Istria assumed such proportions as 
rarely seen in Europe. 
  By resorting to open terror, they stage-managed various show 
trials: The most notorious one in Istria was the one of patriot 
Vladimir Gortan and his comrades from Berm. It would be 
impossible to recount all the hardships Istria had gone through 
during the Italian fascist occupation. In one year 
alone--1934-35--our people were sentenced to 431 years in the 
dungeon. While the Croats were persecuted and jailed in this 
way, the Italians and the pro-Italian independence seekers were 
buying up Croatian land and doing what some are using today to 
claim that Istria is Italian. 
  This persecution and impoverishment of the Croatian people 
in 
Istria resulted in the expulsion of some 100,000 Croats from 
Istria. Of this number, some 70,000 Croats moved to Croatia and 
other southern Slav countries while around 25,000 emigrated to 
North America and around 5,000 left for Belgium and France. 
This exodus of the Croatian people from Istria was joined by 
another 40,000 Croats from the regions occupied by the Italian 
occupation army following the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1941. 
  All of this persecution, this terror, this policy of 
Istria's 
de-Croatization did not achieve the desired results. But the 
consequences of this will even be exploited today as an impetus 
for continuing such policies. No wonder the demographic picture 
of Istria was altered with the persecution of Croats and the 
colonization of Italians--not only officials and Carabinieri, 
but also workers, [word indistinct], road builders, lumberjacks, 
teachers, and others. The demographic picture was not the only 
thing that had changed. This left a deep psychological and 
political imprint. To hell with that, gentlemen, brothers, and 
sisters, we shall heal these wounds and we shall not allow 
Istria to be ruled by the consequences of such a situation. 
[applause] 
  This is how Istria entered World War II, when the 
antifascist 
struggle began in Croatia. The antifascist leadership of 
Croatia, headed by Andrija Hebrang, immediately comprehended its 
historic task: that it should kindle and organize the 
antifascist struggle in Istria. From the very first day of the 
antifascist struggle in Croatia it considered Istria to be an 
inalienable part of the antifascist struggle and a constituent 
part of Croatia. It directed the antifascist struggle on such a 
basis, and I personally know Istrians who were in Zagreb at the 
time and whom the leadership of Croatia's antifascist struggle 
was sending to Istria and Gorski Kotar to organize the 
antifascist struggle in Istria from Gorski Kotar. [applause] 
  Of course, the Italian fascist occupiers were particularly 
bent on weeding out any possible form of antifascist resistance 
in Istria, and that is why the beginning of the armed struggle 
here, the organizing of Partisan units and bodies of antifascist 
authority was extremely difficult; so the antifascist struggle 
in Istria had to be directed from Gorski Kotar. 
  The National Liberation Movement in Istria grew somewhat in 
size in 1942 when, led by the Communist Party of Croatia, a 
directive was issued, and district committees for Istria and 
other antifascist bodies of the antifascist struggle in Istria 
were formed. 
  The fifth battalion of the Primorsko-Goranski Partisan 
Detachment was formed in Gorski Kotar in May 1942 with the task 
of going to Istria and setting in motion the antifascist 
struggle there. But the power of the Italian fascist occupier 
... [pauses] and the oppression of the Croatian people in Istria 
was such that it was unable to provide support and so this 
battalion was unable to break through there. However, attempts 
to break up the antifascist struggle were resumed. In the 
second half of 1943 a group of fighters moved from the area of 
Ilirska Bistrica and pitched camp on (Planik) but was unable to 
maintain itself there either. It had to return to Gorski Kotar. 
With the repeated attempt of the Istrian Croats who were there, 
and as a result of the efforts of the Croatian antifascist 
leadership, an Istrian Partisan unit was re-formed in the area 
of Gerovo and sent back to Istria. The Istrian detachment known 
as Vladimir Gortan was founded in August 1942 from the Istrians 
who fought in Gorski Kotar and in other Croatian areas -- and 
they were in all Croatian regions, something which indicates the 
unity of Croatian Istria. 
  In September, following the capitulation of Italy, a general 
uprising of the Croatian people broke out. It was led by 
antifascist organizations. Italian military formations were 
disarmed, and virtually the whole population of Croatian Istria 
took part in this general Croatian uprising. About 9,000 
Italian soldiers were disarmed. About 18,000 people took part 
in this antifascist movement at that time. By 11 September 1943 
virtually the whole of Istria was liberated, apart from Pula, 
Koper, and Izola. 
  The National Liberation Committee for Istria proclaimed the 
unification of Istria and Croatia on 13 September 1943. The 
proclamation says: The spirit of Istria has remained 
unsubjugated. We did not want to become obedient slaves. In 
these decisive moments our people have demonstrated a high level 
of national consciousness. They have proved to all and sundry 
that Istria is a Croatian land and that it will remain Croatian 
[applause]. 
  Let those who do not like to hear these words here today 
ponder this historical document. 
  This historic document further says: Relying on their own 
resources and not waiting for others to bring them freedom, the 
Istrians rose and stormed the barracks, seizing arms which are 
to be used in defense of their right to liberty; they opened 
wide the notorious prison gates and released the proud sons of 
unsubjugated Istria; never again shall we allow others to 
manipulate our fate; the Italian garrisons are in our hands; 
Italian soldiers are fleeing our soil; the people are taking the 
helm into their own hands for the first time in history; Istria 
is joining the motherland and is declaring unification with the 
rest of our Croatian brothers [applause]. 
  We are firmly holding these arms, the proclamation told 
Istrians. Let us stand at the bulwark of liberty and let us not 
allow anybody to take it away ever again; we must remain masters 
in our own home; the proclamation ends by saying "Long Live 
Croatian Istria" and by hailing the members of the antifascist 
democratic coalition, Yugoslavia among them. 
  This decision by the Istrian (?National Liberation) Council 
on unification with Croatia was confirmed by ZAVNOH, the 
National Antifascist Council for the People's Liberation of 
Croatia, on 20 September 1943, which on this occasion anulled 
all treaties, pacts, and conventions concluded by the Kingdom of 
Yugoslavia and later the NDH [Independent State of Croatia] in 
relation to Istria. 
  In mid-September 1943, the main HQS of the Croatian Partisan 
army sent a large number of military commanders to Istria to 
organize new units. The operative HQS for Istria was formed 
here in Pazin on 23 September. The First Istrian Brigade, 
Vladimir Gortan, was also formed in September, as well as the 
Second Istrian Brigade, the First Partisan Ucka Unit and the 
Second Pula Unit. At the same time a brigade and unit were 
formed in the Slovene part. 
  However, what ensued was the occupation of Istria by the 
German Nazi army. This occupation was just as oppressive, so 
oppressive that it managed to push back the partisan forces; 
moreover, it again gave free reign to those who had ruled during 
the Italian fascist occupation, the pro-Italian independence 
seekers, and all those anti-Croatian elements. Italian 
secessionists in Istria were emboldened by this occupation. 
  Of course, the Croatian leadership did not give up the idea 
to continue the antifascist struggle in Istria, to nurture the 
Croatian spirit in Istria, and to create conditions for Istria's 
unification with Croatia after the war. In such circumstances 
and regardless of the difficulties encountered in the military 
sense, representative bodies of the antifascist movement were 
being formed in Istria. In addition to the Provincial National 
Liberation Council -- which was later renamed the Regional 
Council -- there were three district councils: in Pazin, Buzet, 
and Pula; there were 13 district councils, 37 municipal 
councils, 3 city councils and 330 local village councils with 
more than 1,800 deputies. 
  The number of fighters increased again -- from 1,300 in 
February 1944 to more than 4,000 in April. At that time the 
leadership of the Croatian antifascist movement decided to form 
new Istrian brigades. The Vladimir Gortan Istrian Brigade was 
formed on Mount Ucka on 1 April. A conference of the Croatian 
antifascist youth of Istria was held the same day, and was 
attended by some 800 delegates. 
  The Pino Budicin Battalion was formed of fighters of Italian 
nationality on 4 April near Bale. 
  The Ucka partisan unit was formed on 6 April and the second 
Pula unit was formed on 11 April. However, all these would not 
have been sufficient to liberate Istria, and the Croatian 
leadership passed a decision to form the 43d Istrian Division in 
Gorski Kotar. This division included the 1st, the 2nd, and the 
3d Istrian Brigades, while the Buzet-Porec unit was formed as an 
auxiliary unit in Istria. 
  All in all, upheld by the spirit of Croatian Istrians and by 
the special concern of the Croatian antifascist leadership, the 
antifascist struggle in Istria was continuous. About 30,000 
soldiers took part in the antifascist struggle. Five to six 
thousand fighters fell in this struggle -- the figure is not 
precise, it is high time that the precise figure is established. 
There were about 25,000 members in the youth antifascist 
organization. I have already spoken about the national power 
committees. There was also a women's antifascist organization. 
  Those Istrians who were forcibly mobilized into the Italian 
Army joined the overseas brigades after the capitulation of 
Italy. These brigades later became part of the partisan units. 
The Italian and German occupying forces in Istria killed -- 
according to the information at my disposal -- 4,285 of its 
citizens; 21,509 persons were taken to concentration camps; 
5,595 houses were burned down or destroyed. 
  In this antifascist struggle Istria gave a large 
contribution 
toward the toppling of fascism, its liberation, the annexation 
with Croatia and toward the victory of antifascism in Croatia. 
Istria has 10 people's heroes: Olga Ban, Dragomir Bencic, Mateo 
Benussi, Mate Blazina, Tino Budicin, Jurica Kalac, Joakim 
Rakovac, Jovan Stokovac, Joza Suran and Agustin [last name 
indistinct]. Istria has a lot to be proud of -- with its 
contribution in the antifascist struggle. This contribution and 
the lives which Istria had given put us under the obligation to 
honor the proclamation of Istria: that Istria has been and will 
always be a Croatian land. [applause] 
  Despite the fact that during the fascist occupation and the 
antifascist war a large part of the Italian minority stayed 
close to the Italian occupying authorities -- which resulted in 
strong hatred between the local Croatian population and the 
Italian minority -- nevertheless, a process was under way even 
at that time to create an alliance between Croatian patriots and 
Italian democrats and antifascists. This helped to provide the 
possibility for setting up Italian units and for laying the 
foundations of cooperation between the majority Croatian people 
and the Italian minority in the region at a later stage and 
today. 
  However, the victorious end to the antifascist war in 
Croatia 
and former Yugoslavia, as I said, under the leadership of the 
Croats Andrija Hebrang and Vladimir Nazor in Croatia and Josip 
Broz and Ribar in Yugoslavia -- and this was not a coincidence 
-- this victorious end which resulted in the genuine integration 
of Istria in the mother country, this victorious outcome, meant 
that the dreams of the Croatian patriots within the Renaissance 
Movement and generally of the Croatian people in the region had 
come true. But, during the socialist Yugoslavia and socialist 
Croatia they were let down even, as I said, when it came to the 
anniversary day and in everyday politics, in particular. 
  Today Istria must remember that Croat statehood in Istria, 
that the antifascist struggle in Istria, could not have been 
possible without those Istrian champions of the Croatian 
Renaissance Movement who had close links with the Croatian 
nation's 19th Century Renaissance Movement, in general. 
  Juraj Dobrila, Dr Dinko Vitezic, Matko Bastijan, Matko 
Mandic, Dr. Anton Mahnic, and Dr. Matko Laginja, a lawyer and 
writer who at the time of the creation of the common state was 
in charge of the initiative to incorporate Istria in the mother 
country, were all Croatian champions of the Renaissance Movement 
in Istria. Of course, a special place among these is reserved 
for Vjekoslav Stincic, and Bozo Milanovic, a priest who took up 
and further promoted the traditions of the Croatian Renaissance 
Movement and who, in the socialist period after World War II and 
at the Paris Conference, had the courage to say that Istria was 
Croatian and could be neither Slovene nor anyone else's. This 
was recorded in international diplomatic (?documents) [applause] 
  I have already mentioned Dr. Anton Mandic -- not just 
because 
he played a prominent role as a Croatian politician from Istria 
between the two world wars, but also because after World War II 
he was the one who was aware of something that tends to be 
ignored today, the man who was aware that Croatia [as heard] 
would have to be extensively linked with its mother country of 
Croatia, who tried to persuade Josip Broz as far back as 1945 
and 1946 to have a road and rail tunnel built under Mount Ucka 
to link Istria with Croatia. He also suggested other measures 
-- and I personally spoke to him about them. People of this type 
are often forgotten nowadays and instead, ideas are promoted 
which advocate that Istria be singled out as something special. 
  In the socialist period Istria was neglected because the 
Croatian communists who came to power in Zagreb after Hebrang 
did not know how to pursue a correct national policy. Theirs 
was an internationalist policy. I personally heard them say 
that in socialism it did not matter whether Istria was Croatian, 
Slovene, or Italian. These people were playing games with the 
fate of both Istria and Croatia. But those times have long 
gone. The centuries-long struggle of the Croatian people in 
general and of Istria in particular ended with the creation of 
the independent and democratic Croatia which will know how to 
compensate for the evil deeds and injustices committed against 
Istria. These are, above all, reflected in the fact that 
foreign occupation, or more specifically the Italian occupation, 
and the anti-nationalist and anti-Croatian policy by socialist 
authorities, resulted in the gradual reduction of -- and not 
just by Italian but also earlier by the policy of the Habsburgs 
-- resulted in the gradual reduction in the size of the Croatian 
population in Istria. 
  Any normal person must take heed of the fact that in 1846 
there were 134,455 Croats living in Istria, that in 1919 there 
were 181,605 Croats in Istria, and that in 1981 that number was 
134,890 -- or as many as 140 years ago but fewer than 70 years 
ago -- and that between 1981 and 1991 the number of Croats in 
Istria dropped to 111,593. These are the consequences of 
Istria's special position and of a policy designed to alienate 
Istria and to undermine its Croatian identity. [applause] 
  Present-day democratic Croatia can and must rectify the 
situation. [applause] 
  The state and political leadership of present-day Croatia, 
who, despite the unfavorable domestic and international 
situation, knew how to go about creating a democratic, 
independent, sovereign, autonomous Croatia, to ensure not merely 
its international recognition but to see it accepted within the 
world international system as a serious factor in creating a new 
international order in this part of southeastern Europe -- this 
leadership will know how to resolve all problems facing the 
Croatian people and the Croatian state in Istria. This Croatian 
leadership will know how to ensure Croatia's economic, cultural 
and democratic development. 
  But we shall not allow ideas which -- whether those who 
promote them in the name of Istria's alleged special position 
like it or not -- we see as direct continuation of the situation 
which led to Istria losing some of its Croatian characteristics. 
  So let me repeat: Just as Croatian national consciousness 
was maintained in Istria by virtue of the fact that Croatian 
revivalists from Istria were linked with Croatian revivalists in 
the 19th Century, so the antifascist struggle in Istria could 
develop and bring both the victory of antifascism to this 
movement in Istria and the decision, adopted in 1943, to join 
and unite with the homeland of Croatia. This was because 
Istria's antifascist struggle was linked -- and not merely 
linked but had its foundations and drew its strength from and 
had its base in the entire antifascist struggle in Croatia. 
  Hence the reality of Istria today -- including political, 
economic and any other reality -- can advance and develop only 
if linked, or if you like only if linked even more closely, with 
Croatia than all the other counties of Croatia, precisely 
because Istria has suffered such consequences and because claims 
are being made [applause]. And ladies and gentlemen, dear 
Croatian brothers and sisters, and all citizens of Istria, as a 
result of all those theories and political programs which talk 
of Istria as a separate entity and of Istria as a transborder 
region and of the demilitarization of Istria, of the separate 
Istrian people, of the self-sufficiency of Istria and even the 
exploitation of Istria by the rest of Croatia are not only 
harmful but possibly dangerous and fateful. 
  Those behind these ideas -- whether they are aware of this 
or 
not -- these are all a continuation of those policies and that 
situation which brought about such circumstances that made us 
feel the consequences in Istria of foreign government and of the 
foreign political occupation about which I have spoken. 
  These theories and these political programs -- regardless of 
how many democratic trappings they may have -- play into the 
hands of those who, both publicly and in secret, stress rights, 
not only in Istria but also in Rijeka and Dalmatia. And it 
should not be forgotten that in earlier times Italian 
irredentists and imperialists knew how to exploit the supporters 
of Italian rule in Istria and Rijeka and the idea of 
denationalization. They would even cede Rijeka to Italy, which 
otherwise, according to peace treaties, was not envisaged for 
unification with Italy. So they knew how to use these phenomena 
on our territory and they would know how to exploit these 
regionalist ideas today just as formerly the pro-Italian 
independence seekers did, [applause]. 
  Naturally, the Croatian people, which have demonstrated 
their 
national and democratic maturity, which have established their 
own independent and democratic state, their sovereign state, 
will not allow these ideas to develop into a real threat. 
[applause]. 
  And as I have said, this democratic Croatia itself will know 
how to bring Istria into Europe. Furthermore, Croatia was a 
constituent part of Europe throughout its history and was at the 
top in terms of all civic activities, as a constituent part of 
central Europe. What has happened in the last 20 or so years 
when it was Balkanized has not changed anything in essence, 
while today, as I have said, Croatia is a recognized factor in 
the world with which all relevant and important European and 
world factors reckon. 
  Today, democratic Croatia not only has friends and allies 
but it has an international position which enables it to defend 
its sovereign rights and enables it to liberate still occupied 
territories with the aid of the international community if 
possible. If this is impossible then all means will be used 
with the understanding of the international community because 
the international community is aware that democratic Croatia is 
conducting a just, peaceful policy and that it wants to be a 
factor of peace and cooperation between the nations in this part 
of Europe. [applause] 
  We must not allow any regional ideas which would be a 
continuation of pro-autonomy and pro-Italian movements in a 
negative sense in this territory but we also must not forget 
that Italian fascist occupiers -- even though they were 
ostensibly allies of Pavelic's NDH -- established links with 
chetniks from Knin during World War II and that they are doing 
the same today, that they are being visited by certain Italian 
senators in Knin and at their gatherings. They are even making 
some ridiculous jokes about establishing some kind of relations. 
  Therefore, even today we have these trends in our territory 
and despite political and other changes they are present all the 
time -- an attempt to cooperate between Italian fascist 
imperialism and irredentism and greater Serbian imperialism -- 
this has to be borne in mind here in Istria all the time. 
[applause] 
  This association of Italian fascists and irredentists and 
the 
Knin rebels against Croatia looks funny and it is funny, but it 
could be tragic if we were to forget that even the smallest of 
dangers can become a huge threat if it is not taken into 
account. Democratic Croatia wants to cooperate with democratic 
Italy and to secure all ethnic minority rights for the Italian 
minority in Istria and Rijeka, in accordance with international 
conventions. However, we demand the same for the Croatian 
minority in Italy, from Trieste to [word indistinct]. The 
Croatian minority in Italy is larger than the Italian minority 
here. We demand reciprocity. 
  We hope that the present regime in Italy will continue the 
policy of its democratic governments: good-neighborly relations 
with Croatia and Slovenia. We hope that they will respect all 
agreements and treaties signed after World War II. Croatia is 
open and ready and wants relations which are as friendly and 
wide-ranging as possible with democratic Italy. It is prepared 
to discuss all issues regarding the rights of an ethnic minority 
but as I said this must also be true for the Croatian minority 
in Italy. 
  I believe that in democratic Italy the kind of wisdom will 
prevail which led Italy out of fascism into the fold of the 
world's democratic countries which also signed these agreements 
upon which we are today building our mutual relations. 
Consequently, if we do not attach too much importance to what 
is being articulated as an irredentist and imperialist drive 
toward Istria, Rijeka, and Dalmatia, we nevertheless must not 
ignore such phenomena precisely because they are being linked 
with Serbian imperialism and its anti-Croatian policies in 
Croatia and the area of the former Yugoslavia as a whole. This 
is why we favor a situation whereby we can develop in every way, 
by all means, friendly and good-neighborly relations with the 
Italian people and the democratic Italy. 
  Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, as I have said, 
Croatia has won friends and allies in the whole world due to the 
stability of its democratic system and the correctness of its 
policies. Today, Croatia can say that it has friends and allies 
in the world's most powerful power, in the United States. We 
also have friendly relations with huge China at the other end of 
the world. We also have friendly relations with the European 
Union [EU] and friendly relations with the main EU countries and 
with Islamic countries. Croatia's international position is such 
that it also safeguards the stability of Croatia's internal 
development. 
  In economic terms, despite all the consequences of war, 
Croatia has in a sense performed an economic miracle to the 
surprise and bafflement of serious people and those who were not 
sympathetic to us. Our government has managed to slash the 
inflation rate to an extent achieved by few countries in Europe. 
Or rather, none of the ex-socialist countries has managed to do 
so to the same extent. We have today our national currency, the 
kuna which is already a stable convertible currency [applause]. 
This national currency of ours has already been included among 
the world's financial indicators. Croatia is still, 
understandably, facing its main task -- to liberate its occupied 
areas [applause]. 
  As I said, we are going to continue our policy; on our part 
we are going to do everything to bring about a peaceful 
incorporation in agreement with the international community and 
with its support and that of the United Nations, so the UN 
Security Council resolutions on the incorporation of these areas 
into Croatia can be implemented peacefully. Understandably, if 
these efforts remain futile and if the international community 
and the UN turn out to be helpless then the Croatian people as a 
sovereign people will be capable and will know how to use all 
means to restore the constitutional and legal order across their 
entire homeland. [applause] 
  Let me finish, please. I understand the impatience and 
justified anger of our refugees, from Baranja and Vukovar to 
Rijeka or Dubrovnik, to Banija and Kordun. At the same time I 
call on them: be patient for a little while, trust this Croatian 
state leadership who knew how to establish an independent and 
sovereign Croatia, who knew how to win friends and allies. We 
shall know how to do everything possible to liberate Croatia's 
occupied areas without casualties. 
  We are also going to do everything we have to -- if we have 
to -- to help you return to your homes, to the ruins of your 
burned-down houses. We are going to help you restore them. I 
have been meeting you all over Croatia. Understandably, you 
cannot remain homeless while Serbian occupation forces reign on 
Croatian territory. 
  Consequently, the sovereign and democratic Croatia has known 
and will know what it wants. We needed friends and allies in 
the world and we knew how to win them. On the other hand, the 
world's democratic forces need a stable and democratic Croatia. 
This is the kind of Croatia that will remain because the 
Croatian people have realized that they have restored Croatian 
sovereignty through their sacrifices and skills in all Croatian 
regions, in all Croatian areas, counties. 
  What remains is what I said was their immediate task. But 
this Croatia has its position in the international order. This 
Croatia is today respected by everyone, including those who at 
some stage did not want it to exist. 
  The antifascist struggle of the Croatian people in the 
whole of Croatia, including Istria, hugely contributed to the 
very foundations of this democratic Croatia. Without the 
contribution of the antifascist struggle there would be no 
independent and democratic Croatia today. This is something the 
democratic Croatian authorities will bear in mind. 
  Likewise, members of Croatia's antifascist movement in World 
War II must bear in mind the fact that Croatia is preoccupied 
with the problems of its current war and with everything else we 
are facing today, so it has not been able to pay enough 
attention to those members of the antifascist movement who were 
partly in the service of Croatia's state freedom and Croatian 
statehood idea, just as they were also -- if they were members 
of the Serbian people -- gripped by the idea that a Croatian 
state should not be allowed to exist. [sentence as heard] 
  Consequently, these members of the antifascist movement of 
Serbian nationality must also understand this reality; they must 
understand that the essence of antifascist struggle in Croatia 
was the struggle for Croatian freedom, for Croatian statehood. 
I want to recall that even the Serbian units in Banija and 
Kordun were flying the Croatian flag. This is the essential 
feature which decisively characterized the antifascist movement 
of Croatia. This is why we have incorporated antifascism into 
the foundations of Croatian freedom, Croatian statehood. 
  Likewise, all members of the antifascist struggle must 
understand that they must get rid of their notions if what they 
saw in it was a struggle against some kind of independent 
Croatian state. This desperation of the Croatian people in 
World War II, this very complex situation, was to some extent 
clearly reflected in the situation brought about in the wake of 
the proclamation of independent Croatia, in the rebellion of the 
Serbs from Knin and elsewhere, who were directly instructed by 
the Yugoslav communist army and Belgrade. Consequently, all of 
this is a reality suggesting that we must bear in mind these 
problems in their entirety, including the antifascist struggle 
as well as the struggle for Croatian freedom and a Croatian 
state. 
  Hence, let us pay eternal tribute to the honour and glory of 
members of the antifascist struggle of Croatia and of Istria 
within the same context. Long live Croatian Istria in this 
democratic and sovereign Croatia.
