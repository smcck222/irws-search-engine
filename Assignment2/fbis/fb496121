<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Intelligence Agency -- Clean"] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Parliament Committee for control 
over the work of the State Intelligence Agency announced the 
results of its surveillance of the agency documents. The 
Committee confirmed the intelligence service had not undertaken 
any operative or technical methods towards VMRO-DPMNE [Internal 
Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for 
Macedonian National Unity], nor towards any other political 
party. The document presented to the public by Ljupco 
Georgievski is a forgery, as there is no original or any other 
document in the intelligence documentation under that number and 
date. The intelligence does not undertake measures and methods, 
but on individuals connected with foreign intelligence services 
or because of activities aimed at endangering the constitutional 
establishment of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], the Committee report states.

  [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- At the beginning of the 
yesterday's session, the deccan [as received] of the defence 
attorneys, Kleanthi Koci, requested that the jury, in other 
judicial processes, should take into consideration the extension 
of the defence's right in order to avoid technical mistakes 
which were noticed during this process. 
  In absence of his client, Manush Myftiu's attorney read the 
defence saying of his defendant and though he did not accepted 
the charge, he said that he considers the jury's decision to be 
reasonable and requested that the decision should be take his 
health into consideration. 
  Adil Carcani's attorney requested the innocence of his 
client, trying to justify the acts of which he is accused. In 
regard to the part of treatment of the Hoxha family, after the 
death of the dictator [Enver Hoxha], the attorney said if the 
Central Committee secretary and the chairman of the former 
government decided for such a treatment, the purposes were very 
noble and dignified for the Albanian nation. 
  Kleanthi Koci, Ramiz Alia's attorney, pointed out that this 
process is of a great importance for the history of the Albanian 
nation. Attorney Koci supports the innocence of his client 
saying that he has not found elements of crime and genocide 
carried out by Ramiz Alia. He said that Ramiz Alia had agreed 
with the special treatment of the former leadership, had 
approved the platform of the former secret police, and had made 
democratic improvements in it. Koci said that Ramiz Alia had 
approved the anti-religious and anti- constitutional movement in 
the 1967, and had agreed with the treatment of the Hoxha family 
after the death of the dictator, all of these acts in the 
context of his official duties. Attorney Koci appreciated the 
figure of his client as a former president though Prosecutor 
Fana has made clear in the first session that Ramiz Alia is not 
being accused of any acts he committed during the time he was 
president. 
  The attorney of defendants Rita Marko and Hekuran Isai did 
not accepted the decision of the pretence for defendant Rita 
Marko [as received] saying that it is a partial attitude toward 
this client because as he said, the state of health of Rita 
Marko is the same as those of A. Carcanit and M. Myftiu. The 
attorney said he believes that the jury will declare a suspended 
sentence for defendant Rita Marko. 
  Hekuran Isai's attorney said that his client does not accept 
the charge for legal reasons. 
  The attorney of Aranit Cela tried to justify the activity of 
the Internment-Expulsion Commission. 
  The defence attorney of Rapi Mino spoke once again for the 
way of proceeding of the State Commission for 
Interment-Expulsion based on the analyses made by him and 
witnesses during the judicial investigations. 
  The attorney of defendant Veiz Haderi did not accepted the 
charge against his client. 
  During the yesterday's seance, the defendants also expressed 
last saying [as received]. Speaking for half an hour, Ramiz 
Alia considered his charge as a staged and spoke of past and 
current current Albanian policy. Ramiz Alia did not mentioned 
the parts of the accusation against him, because as he said at 
the beginning, the sentence and its measure were of no 
importance for him, but avoiding the trial's issues he spoke of 
the actions for constructing the railways, for the last 
elections in Libofsha commune, for the Anti-Fascist National 
Liberation War and its anniversaries. 
  The decision for the 10 former high communist functionaries 
will be declared on Tuesday, June 28, 1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva: "Czech President Havel Visits </F>
Sofia"] 
  [Text] Sofia, June 23 (BTA) -- President Vaclav Havel of 
the Czech Republic arrived on a one-day working visit to Sofia 
at noon today. He is accompanied by the Minister of National 
Wealth Management and Privatization Jiri Skalicky and First 
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra. 
  Mr. Havel was welcomed by President Zhelyu Zhelev with full 
military honours. 
  Immediately after the ceremony, the two presidents had a 
nearly one-hour-long session. They said after the meeting that 
their conversation had been very useful. The two briefed each 
other on the development of political processes, the processes 
and prospects of democratization, the progress of economic 
reform in the two countries and exchanged views on foreign 
policy problems, stressing the situation in the Balkans. 
  The two countries' integration with the West European and 
Euroatlantic structures was also on the agenda. "On this point, 
our views are identical, and we arrived at the conclusion that 
we must not compete but help each other for an earlier 
integration of each of the countries," the Bulgarian head of 
state pointed out. 
  "Probably the most important thing on which we agreed again 
was that our countries have the same political organization and 
foster the same values... We also agreed that the countries 
which managed to shed communism should also walk on the same 
road and cooperate, exchange experience and possibly coordinate 
their positions in the directions I listed (European and 
Euroatlantic integration), but this cooperation should by no 
means be institutionalized. For even the slightest sense that 
the post-communist countries are setting up some sort of 
community would create the impression that instead of aspiring 
to join the European community, they are aspiring to divide it," 
President Havel said. In his view, what matters most is to have 
continued working contacts between these countries. 
  "We devoted a considerable part of our conversation to the 
Balkans, on which we turned out to have identical views," Mr. 
Havel said. "I set forth our firm assessment of the presence of 
1,000 Czech Blue Helmets in the territory of former Yugoslavia, 
which we believe is extremely important and extremely useful for 
the maintenance of peace and the pacification of the area," 
President Zhelev indicated, adding that "the Czech Republic is 
far from that region, it has no immediate territorial, minority 
or any other problems with ex-Yugoslavia so as to be suspected 
of self-seeking motives." "We discussed the risks to which this 
area is prone, especially in Kosovo, the risks to Albania should 
events take an adverse turn," Dr. Zhelev also said. 
  Russia and "our ambivalent attitude to it," as President 
Zhelev put it, was also discussed. The sides noted their 
support for the democratic forces in Russia and their 
"categorical distancing from all retrograde forces which are 
trying to take advantage of the difficulties: neofascists, 
neocommunists and ultra nationalists, who seek to isolate 
Russia," Dr. Zhelev said. Both sides are pleased with Russia's 
formal signing of Partnership for Peace without setting 
conditions for a privileged status within the North Atlantic 
Alliance, President Zhelev pointed out. 
  Asked about the similarities and differences in the two 
countries' democratic processes, President Havel said that both 
countries have created all prerequisites for development of the 
democratic system. "Clearly, the Czech Republic is leading 
among the post-communist countries because 65 percent of the 
property there is already private. I think the main reason for 
this process is the unity of democratic forces in the Czech 
Republic, something of which we cannot boast, at least for the 
time being, and I think this is the main reason for Bulgaria's 
overall lag in the reforms," President Zhelev said for his part. 
  In parallel talks, Czech Privatization Minister Jiri 
Skalicky 
conferred with the Executive Director of the Privatization 
Agency Reneta Indzhova, and Deputy Minister Vondra with 
Bulgarian First Deputy Foreign Minister Valentin Gatsinski. 
  Later in the day, President Havel is expected to meet with 
Bulgarian intellectuals for the presentation of his book "Power 
of the Powerless." 
  This is Mr. Havel's second visit to Bulgaria after April 
1992, when he arrived as president of Czechoslovakia to sign a 
Treaty of Friendly Relations and Cooperation between the two 
countries.

  [Text] Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, in a special 
meeting this afternoon, received Mr. Van der Stoel, CSCE high 
commissioner for national minorities, who is visiting our 
country. 
  During the conversation, which was held in a friendly 
atmosphere, Meksi thanked Van der Stoel for his continuous 
commitment to Albania and for the objective reports he has 
presented. Meksi went on to brief the CSCE official on the 
situation of the Greek minority, the advanced standards of 
freedoms and rights guaranteed to them, and the activity of 
state institutions, which aim for continual perfection. He 
particularly informed Van der Stoel about the equal treatment 
granted to minority members in all fields and commented on the 
special measures that the government has taken to develop their 
identity in the fields of education, culture, religion, and 
others. 
  Dwelling on the problem of minorities in a broader 
framework, 
Meksi stressed that, in our endeavors, we often run across 
problems that arise due to the illegal and anticonstitutional 
activity of certain minority people instigated by Greek 
ultranationalist circles. 
  Meksi stressed the importance of Tirana-Athens bilateral 
relations for the climate in the Balkans and the political 
atmosphere in our region. We are for maintaining friendly 
relations with Greece, but always by respecting the fundamental 
principles of international relations and the reciprocal 
interests of other countries. 
  The CSCE high commissioner assessed positively Albania's 
readiness to receive him and create the necessary conditions for 
his mission. After each visit, he stressed, I see positive 
changes in the Greek minority's position. The most positive 
feature is the harmonic, interethnic coexistence between the 
Albanians and the Greeks, and that is why I value your policy 
for preserving and further consolidating it. 
  Meksi and Van der Stoel then viewed special aspects of the 
minority's position in the fields of education, exercise of 
religion, etc. The situation in the region and Albanian-Greek 
bilateral relations were other topics on which they exchanged 
opinions.

  [Text] Continuing his visit to Albania, Van der Stoel, 
CSCE high commissioner for national minorities, upon his request 
and with permission from the procurator general of the Republic 
of Albania, met this morning with the five Albanian nationals of 
Greek origin that were arrested for anticonstitutional activity. 
  Before his departure from Albania, Van der Stoel gave a 
short 
interview to correspondent Shpetim Roqi. Asked what opinion he 
formulated from the meeting with the arrested, he answered: 
This morning I met five of the six arrested, as one of them is 
further along in his defense. I am very pleased that I, along 
with my adviser and an interpreter, was given the opportunity to 
meet with them alone and not in the presence of the Albanian 
authorities. 
  Asked what he gathered from the conversation with the five 
arrested regarding their treatment, Van der Stoel answered: Of 
course, we should wait for the trial. The defendants told me 
that they were given the right to defense attorneys and that 
they have already met with them. Regarding whether they are 
guilty or innocent, that is for justice to decide. I did not 
hear any complaints about their treatment. 
  Asked what influence his visit will have, he said he hoped 
that his visit will influence the normalizing of Greek-Albanian 
relations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Georgi Pirinski, National Assembly deputy </F>
for the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by Kameliya Evgenieva; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] [Evgenieva] Mr. Pirinski, this is the second time 
that you have resigned as deputy chairman of the BSP [Bulgarian 
Socialist Party] parliamentary group. The first time, the 
reason was your objection to the choice of Petur Boyadzhiev as 
prime ministerial candidate. What is the reason this time? 
  [Pirinski] My different understanding of the line that the 
BSP should follow in the period following the congress. 
  [Evgenieva] Was the congress not to your liking? 
  [Pirinski] Quite the contrary. It gave a true direction for 
the party's work. The problem is that after the congress a 
different line was put forward, which gave priority to social 
demands and problems. This to some extent disengages the BSP in 
relation to the progress of the reforms. 
  [Evgenieva] Why did you refuse to join the BSP Executive 
Bureau? 
  [Pirinski] I cannot be effective in a bureau with such a 
membership. 
  [Evgenieva] Can you be more specific? 
  [Pirinski] Because of the views of the colleagues who 
accepted leading positions in the ruling bodies. 
  [Evgenieva] Such as? 
  [Pirinski] It is not a matter of any particular person, but 
of the positions adopted on the main issue that was under 
discussion in the BSP Supreme Council last year and at the 
beginning of this. It refers to whether we should commit 
ourselves to the reforms or adopt a more neutral position 
regarding the main problem of the market economy, placing more 
stress on social demands. 
  Any attempt to look for a personal angle or personal 
conflicts ignores the essence of the problem. Therefore, I 
decline to answer your question. 
  [Evgenieva] I gather that you want to keep names to 
yourself. 
  [Pirinski] This is not true. 
  [Evgenieva] Before the congress your name was often 
mentioned as the next BSP chairman. Did anyone promise you his 
support? 
  [Pirinski] All kinds of lies, speculative assumptions, and 
insinuations have been made. No one offered me any support. 
For me, this matter simply did not arise, because in recent 
months none other than the party chairman [Zhan Videnov] has 
adopted the line that was and is the right one for the BSP. 
  The trouble is, however, that at the congress much was said 
in support of commitment to the reforms, but the actions that 
followed the congress somehow do not provide convincing evidence 
of this.... 
  [Evgenieva] How do you explain this? 
  [Pirinski] Some members of the BSP leadership may not be 
well enough convinced that the social democratic line is the 
right one. Perhaps they were afraid of how the congress would 
react to this policy, and after the congress they may have 
decided that there is no need to move ahead so fast in this 
direction. 
  [Evgenieva] Who is to blame for this? 
  [Pirinski] I have no explanation. 
  [Evgenieva] You normally supported Zhan Videnov, but 
recently, in the debate on whether to support Lyuben Berov, you 
came out against him. 
  [Pirinski] The political realities on 26 May made it 
necessary to support the cabinet. Prime Minister Berov was 
elected on a program that stated that he would lead the country 
into the elections. This was the alternative that we also 
chose. The SDS [Union of Democratic Forces] is attempting to 
mount an intensive campaign on how the Communists betrayed Berov 
and cast the country into chaos on the eve of their congress. I 
think it would have been political blindness to fall into such a 
trap. Accordingly, there is no reason to think that my 
disagreement with Zhan Videnov's opinion was an act against him. 
  [Evgenieva] Why did you decline President Zhelev's 
invitation to participate in the consultations on privatization? 
  [Pirinski] Zhelev should have invited Professor Stoilov, 
because he actively participated in drafting the Law on 
Amendments and Additions to the Privatization Act. My refusal 
will give me more opportunity to defend my own views in public. 
  [Evgenieva] How? 
  [Pirinski] The OSD [Alliance for Social Democracy] will hold 
its own conference and will try to show the party and society at 
large what it thinks is the right policy at the present juncture. 
  [Evgenieva] Excuse me, but you seem to be fighting for your 
policies in a very strange way. You refuse to join the leading 
BSP bodies, and so give up the chance of directly influencing 
them, but in the meantime you continue to maintain that you will 
influence the BSP. 
  [Pirinski] The other day I met a group of serious BSP 
members who do not support the OSD. They consider that the 
OSD's viewpoint deserves serious attention. People have 
expressed disappointment because the OSD is setting up its own 
clubs instead of joining the party organizations. Therefore, 
you should not think that because we hold no positions in the 
leading bodies means that we have no influence on party thinking. 
  [Evgenieva] What do you think about the influence wielded by 
Lilov, Lukanov, and Zhan Videnov? Who do you think came out on 
top at the congress? 
  [Pirinski] At the congress Zhan Videnov definitely defended 
his position as leader and convincingly demonstrated that he has 
authority and support. However, in the 10-day period following 
the congress, it seems to me that the views of Lilov and those 
who share his views became firmly established in the Executive 
Bureau and the commission responsible for finally drafting the 
program. 
  [Evgenieva] Do you think that the postponement of the BSP 
program until September is a setback for Aleksandur Lilov? 
  [Pirinski] You should ask him this. I think that it was a 
well founded decision by the BSP. How various people regard it 
is their problem. 
  [Evgenieva] What is your comment on Andrey Lukanov's removal 
from the BSP Supreme Council? 
  [Pirinski] This is a loss only for the Supreme Council.

<F P=106> [Declaration of the Union of Democratic Forces National </F>
Assembly Faction: "This Form of Boycott Helps the Bulgarian 
Socialist Party"; adopted at 22 June meeting of the Assembly 
faction] 
  [Text] On 22 June 1994 the parliamentary faction of the 
Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] discussed the parliamentary 
boycott and decided: 
  1. Article 3 of the Decisions of the Sixth SDS National 
Conference points out specific extraparliamentary actions, 
including a parliamentary boycott, which, against the background 
of the governmental crisis that existed then, were expected to 
lead to toppling the cabinet and the holding of early 
parliamentary elections. 
  2. This decision was not fully implemented. Only the 
decision on the SDS parliamentary faction walking out of the 
National Assembly sessions was adopted and implemented. 
  3. In this manner, the parliamentary boycott, which was not 
supported by the extraparliamentary actions, did not prompt the 
fall of the government and the holding of early parliamentary 
elections. 
  4. This form of boycott did not block, but rather 
facilitated the work of the parliamentary majority of the 
Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], which aims at recommunization, 
and contradicts the interests of the country. 
  5. The specific form of the boycott that was adopted -- 
selectively participating in or walking out of the National 
Assembly sessions -- jeopardizes the authority of the SDS as a 
serious political force in and outside the country. The 
parliamentary faction's work has been disorganized and 
deactivated. Thus, the manner in which this specific political 
action is being effected rather serves than hurts the interests 
of the BSP. 
  Therefore, for the aforementioned reasons, the SDS 
parliamentary faction decides as follows: 
  It insists that the SDS National Coordinating Council 
analyze 
the implementation of Article 3 of the Decisions of the Sixth 
SDS National Conference and the results of the currently 
implemented form of parliamentary boycott, and express its 
opinion whether the recommendation of the aforementioned 
decisions has been implemented, and whether the boycott produced 
results that prompt early parliamentary elections.

<F P=106> [Document issued by the National Peasant Christian </F>
Democratic Party on 13 June; place not given: "Procedure To 
Suspend President Ion Iliescu -- Initiated on 13 June in View of 
Gathering 167 Signatures of Romanian Parliamentarians"] 
  [Text] To the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies; to the 
Speaker of the Senate: 
  The undersigned deputies and senators, on the basis of 
Article 95 of Romania's Constitution, request that you commence 
the procedure to suspend Romanian President Ion Iliescu from 
office. The reasons we believe Mr. Ion Iliescu should be 
suspended from office are as follows: 
  De facto: 
  During a recent visit to the town of Satu Mare, President 
Ion 
Iliescu made public statements concerning the issue of 
nationalized dwellings. President Ion Iliescu asserted that, 
through the court rulings that admitted the claims of the people 
whose dwellings had been nationalized -- to the effect that 
their properties have been restored and the tenants have been 
evacuated -- "justice has outlawed itself." 
  President Ion Iliescu displayed revolt against the rapidity 
with which certain courts ruled in favor of the owners in such 
litigations, adding that the courts should wait until the new 
bill [on the legal status of nationalized dwellings] is passed 
by Parliament and promulgated. At the same time, President Ion 
Iliescu also asserted that such court rulings should not be 
carried out. 
  De jure: 
  The statements made by President Ion Iliescu are extremely 
grave because they flagrantly violate several stipulations of 
the Constitution and a number of laws that ensure the proper 
functioning of the law-governed state. These stipulations are 
the following: 
  1. Article 41 and 42 of Romania's Constitution refers to the 
right to private property and the right to inherit such property. 
  2. Article 21 of the Constitution guarantees free access to 
justice. 
  3. Article 16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, cumulated 
with Article 21, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution, stipulates 
that no law may obstruct the right to address justice, in which 
case President Ion Iliescu situated himself above the law. 
  4. Article 3 of the Civil Code, which terms as culpable all 
judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer 
justice, claiming that the law does not stipulate anything, or 
it is blurred, or insufficient. 
  5. Article 123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and Article 
3 of Law No. 92/1992 on the Organization of Justice Courts 
stipulates that judges are independent and are to submit solely 
to law. 
  6. Article 127, Paragraph 1 of the Penal Code, which 
punishes the infraction of not submitting to justice court 
rulings, with the application of Article 25 of the Penal Code, 
which defines the way in which instigators participate, and 
Article 27 of the Penal Code, which stipulates that instigators 
are to be punished according to the law to the extent of real 
culprits. 
  The significance of the president's deeds: 
  1. Article 95, Paragraph 1 of the Constitution stipulates 
that the Romanian president may be ordered solely if his deeds 
are of a grave nature. 
  The public statements made by President Ion Iliescu are of 
such a nature, as we will prove further. By his statements, 
President Ion Iliescu: 
  1. Disregarded two fundamental rights stipulated and 
guaranteed by the Constitution: The right to private property 
(Article 41) and the right to inherit such property (Article 
42), as well as regulations of the Civil Code stipulating the 
methods in which those rights can be exerted. 
  2. Disregarded the citizens' right to free access to 
justice, as stipulated in Article 21 of the Constitution. 
  3. By asserting that justice has outlawed itself, he 
situated himself above the law, which is prohibited by Article 
16, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution. 
  4. By making the aforementioned assertion, he impeded upon 
the independence of the judges, which is guaranteed by Article 
123, Paragraph 2 of the Constitution and by Article 3 of Law No. 
92/1992 on the Organization of the Justice Courts, despite the 
fact that Article 3 of the Civil Code terms as culpable all 
judges who deny restoring justice by refusing to administer 
justice in the cases assigned to them, claiming that the law 
does not stipulate anything, or it is blurred, or insufficient. 
  The aforementioned assertions of President Ion Iliescu are 
able to negatively influence the proper functioning of courts 
and they are an attempt to intimidate and influence the judges. 
  5. By asserting that such court rulings should not be 
carried out, President Ion Iliescu called for the court rulings 
to be disregarded, which is an infraction according to Article 
25 cumulated with Article 271 of the Penal Code, in which case 
Article 27 of the Penal Code is to be applied. 
  6. President Ion Iliescu's assertions are of an extreme 
concern because they contradict fundamental constitutional 
values, as well as the essential attributions of one of the 
three principal state authorities. Such assertions made by the 
head of the state endanger the proper functioning of the 
law-governed state and they represent a dictatorial act and an 
attempt upon the independence of the judges. 
  Thus, President Ion Iliescu has also violated Article 1, 
Paragraph 3 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Romania 
is a law-governed, democratic, and social state, in which the 
rights and liberties of the citizens are supreme values, which 
are guaranteed. 
  Therefore the continuation of the office of President Ion 
Iliescu represents a grave danger for the strengthening of the 
law-governed state and for Romania's democratic evolution.

  [Text] A press communique faxed to our editorial office by 
the Romanian Presidency reads as follows: 
  This morning Romanian President Ion Iliescu received a 
delegation of the leadership of the Democratic Agrarian Party of 
Romania [PDAR]. The goal of the meeting was to facilitate 
direct contacts, during which the president can be briefed about 
various problems particularly in the economic area and 
especially those prevailing in agriculture. This political 
group has also made public those problems in a recent letter to 
the president and other forums of state power. 
  On this occasion, the sides proceeded to a broad exchange of 
views on the problems that Romania is currently facing, 
concludes the press statement received from the Presidency. 
  After the meeting Iliescu held at Cotroceni Palace with the 
PDAR delegation, Victor Surdu, the PDAR president announced in a 
press statement that during the meeting the party 
representatives expressed the discontent of the Agrarians with 
the lack of receptiveness and effectiveness with which the 
executive acted to solve problems that were repeatedly brought 
to its attention by the PDAR and asked the head of state to act 
more firmly, quote, to ensure the appropriate moral and 
professional performance of the current government team, 
unquote. Surdu added that the PDAR will continue to get 
involved in the political life of the country as an independent 
and decent opposition party. 
  To conclude, the leader of the Agrarians affirmed, quote, I 
believe that the dialogue that we held with the country's 
president, although characterized by a tense atmosphere and the 
presence of certain disagreements regarding the way in which 
certain economic and social problems should be approached, was 
still a useful dialogue. [no reference to end of quotation as 
heard]

<F P=106> [Article by "gyarmath": "The Escalation of Internal </F>
Disputes"] 
  [Text] Since countless events, statements, and press 
releases have, for quite some time, signaled and reminded the 
public, it is no secret that diverse views causing tensions 
within the Kiralyhagomelleki [Pasul Craiului (Oradea)] Reformed 
Church District, and between the bishoprics of Nagyvarad 
[Oradea] and Kolozsvar [Cluj-Napoca] have arisen, and that an 
increasingly poisonous debate has been evolving, in the course 
of which the "parties" have not shrunk from going so far as to 
accuse each other. Except for a few extreme nationalist Romanian 
language newspapers, the Romanian political press has stayed 
away from the conflict until now, primarily because they felt 
that autonomous governing bodies of the church, not the press, 
were supposed to resolve conflicts within the church, and 
because disputed issues did not require unsolicited--and, 
additionally, incompetent--advocates. As we already reported 
briefly, the practice followed by newspapers unexpectedly 
changed last week, when an anonymous article appeared in the 
opposition weekly TINERAMA. Its title: "Laszlo Tokes Is Not a 
Real Bishop." From a practical standpoint, the article 
summarizes all of several years of accusations leveled by the 
"interested parties" against Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church 
District Bishop Laszlo Tokes, which have become known to the 
greater public, one way or another. 
  The TINERAMA article is based on a letter addressed to 
Presidential Counselor Victor Opaschi--with a facsimile of the 
letter printed and signed by Lugos [Lugoj] parochial Minister 
Istvan Higyed, Chief Trustee Balint B. Kiss, and Trustee Istvan 
Csaszar. The alleged intent of the letter is "to clarify things 
that happened in the Reformed Church in 1989." The letter 
contains a request to Opaschi "to forward to the signatories a 
copy of the document in which Mr. Ion Iliescu appointed Mr. 
Laszlo Tokes to the Temesvar [Timisoara] Reformed Church 
District--showing the date of the appointment and the capacity 
of the appointee," "because disagreements have surfaced within 
the Reformed Church in this regard; moreover, certain documents 
questioning Mr. Tokes's capacity as a high priest have been 
submitted to the highest legislative forum of the Reformed 
Church (the Synod)." 
  Using this letter as his starting point, the anonymous 
author 
of the TINERAMA article states that the December 1989 
appointment of Laszlo Tokes was based only on a public statement 
by Ion Iliescu; this, in turn, confronted the Reformed Church of 
Romania with the accomplished fact (because the legitimate 
procedure had been circumvented) of having a bishop as its 
leader, who had never been nominated by the Synod for that post. 
Moreover, the author also suggests that presently the Palace of 
Cotroceni is seeking a solution to overcome this difficulty by 
giving legal force to the appointment, because "it does not want 
to let the bishop act on his own, a bishop, who, incidentally, 
is also attempting to unify the two Reformed Church bishoprics 
presently in Romania, under his own leadership, of course." 
  What motivates the Office of the President to support Laszlo 
Tokes in this regard, the weekly newspaper asks. "In order to 
provide an appropriate answer to this question, we must, above 
all, keep in mind the `catalyzing' role Laszlo Tokes had played 
in the revolution (whose first beneficiary was President 
Iliescu), as well as the fact that Virgil Magureanu was Tokes's 
neighbor during his brief exile (17-22 December 1989) to the 
Zilah [Zalau] area!", the newspaper explains. "And we must not 
forget," the author argues, "that whenever the Power `emanating' 
from December 1989 experienced problems, Laszlo Tokes always 
made some forceful anti-Romanian statements (some of these 
aiming for the dissection of the country), thus diverting public 
attention from the real problems, providing a pretext for 
extreme nationalist groups to endlessly recount the watchword 
`Hungarian threat.' And indeed, one or two parties--the Romanian 
National Unity Party [RNEP in Hungarian; PUNR] and the Greater 
Romania (Romania Mare) Party [NRP in Hungarian; PRM]--were 
formed, whose existence is based exclusively on the `Hungarian 
threat,' and which, by no coincidence, support the Power. In 
this context, certain assumptions certainly acquire a different 
meaning: assumptions, according to which Laszlo Tokes's peculiar 
car accident in Hungary was, in reality, a warning to Tokes by 
the Hungarian secret service, an organization that had figured 
out the real game played by Tokes, in support of the Iliescu 
regime. No doubt, in the opinion of the Bucharest regime, Tokes 
has fully deserved the bishop's shoulder trimming, even if those 
may be regarded as illegal," the 13-19 May issue of TINERAMA 
concludes. 
  Let us disregard the absurd insinuations made, and 
conclusions drawn by TINERAMA, the obvious attempt to hammer a 
wedge between Tokes and the opposition, and Tokes and the 
revolution, because the answer to these matters is already 
attached [as published], as provided to this newspaper by the 
Office of the Bishop, Kiralyhagomelleki Reformed Church 
District. On the other hand, we must not remain silent regarding 
our concern about the fact that disputes that disrupt unity, and 
which, by all means, damage the Reformed Church of Romania, have 
transcended their normal boundaries; once outside the limits of 
the church and its forums, the disputes have become 
uncontrollable, and could produce unpredictable consequences. 
Once the greater public becomes aware of these disputes, the 
mutual accusations may rekindle some passions, may become 
divisive, and therefore may perpetuate the conflict, instead of 
producing a fortunate ending. We state in advance that for this 
reason we would not like to become a "forum" for this dispute, 
and that we are not inclined to publish possible and probable 
replies, denials, and explanations. But since journalistic 
practice obligates us to do so, we obviously will publish these 
things anyway. But only under two conditions. First, we will be 
strict about publishing the replies of only those personally and 
directly affected by this issue. Second, replies and denials 
must not exceed acceptable limitations on length. After all, it 
would be more fortunate for the already opposed parties to 
exclude the public which, in essence, has nothing to do with 
this matter, and to make Christian peace through negotiations. 
We convey our best wishes for accomplishing this!

  [Excerpts] An agreement on the government coalition has 
been drawn up. [passage omitted] The agreement will only become 
final if the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] congress and the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] convention adopt it on 
Sunday. [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn spoke highly of the agreement: 
  [Begin Horn recording] The MSZP and the SZDSZ are committed 
to an effective market economy supported by social guarantees. 
They take a stand for the guaranteeing of human and political 
rights, for parliamentary democracy and constitutional 
statehood. The joint goals of the MSZP and the SZDSZ are the 
guaranteeing of the independence and security of the Hungarian 
Republic and our country's joining the democratic community of 
the European peoples, in cooperation with neighbouring 
countries, and supporting the Hungarians living in neighboring 
countries. 
  The MSZP and the SZDSZ wish to lead the country out of the 
serious crisis with a sensible and resolute economy policy and a 
sensitive social policy. The two parties are well aware of the 
fact that the preconditions of this are the maintenance of 
social peace and the achievement and maintenance of a general 
agreement with the various groups and [word indistinct] of 
society. [end recording]

<F P=106> ["Sz.Sz."-signed interview with Balint Magyar, executive </F>
member of the Alliance of Free Democrats; place and date not 
given: "Full Publicity Is a Guarantee for Both Sides"] 
  [Text] Balint Magyar is certain that the coalition 
agreement will be approved at the convention of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ] to be held on 26 June. Magyar, who is a 
member of the SZDSZ's negotiating delegation, said that the 
planned agreement maximally meets their prior expectations. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What will be the structure of the planned 
coalition agreement? 
  [Magyar] It will have a relatively short introduction that 
lays down the coalition's goals and substance. This will be 
followed by three big blocks: The first one lists the 
governmental guarantees, the second deals with issues related to 
the government's structure, and the third will contain the 
materials coordinated in the special committees. This last 
section is the longest, making up almost three-quarters of the 
full text. The coalition's government program is based on the 
coordinated materials of the special committees. The appendix 
of the section on structural matters contains the list of 
ministers. Finally, there will be a brief clause that states 
that the agreement has to be approved by the congresses and 
conventions of the two parties. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will you make public all the points of the 
planned agreement? 
  [Magyar] Naturally, the 150- to 160-page coalition agreement 
will not have any secret clauses. As a matter of fact, full 
publicity is a guarantee for both sides because a possible 
violation of the agreement cannot be punished through legal 
means. At the same time, the public will be able to question us 
about implementing the contents of the agreement. In my view, 
the agreement of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the 
SZDSZ will create a precedent in Hungary because this kind of 
political agreement has never been made before. I find it very 
important that the document deals with all the important issues 
in great detail. I believe that this agreement will also have a 
beneficial effect on Hungarian political culture. Public 
attention has mainly been directed to the work of the main 
delegations, while 50 to 60 people on each side took part in the 
joint work of the special committees. It is extremely important 
that, through this, the parliamentary groups and the experts of 
the parties can fully identify with the coalition agreement. 
People who will later have to act together in the government's 
work have, perhaps for the first time in their lives, worked 
together on the special committees. 
  [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What do you expect from the SZDSZ's 
convention on 26 June? 
  [Magyar] I am certain that the majority of the delegates 
will accept the coalition agreement. I would remind people 
that, at the last convention, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that 
only those people should vote for entering the coalition talks 
who really want the coalition. Even then, the proposal on 
entering the talks received 80 percent support. I believe that 
the coalition agreement that is to be signed today maximally 
meets our prior expectations.

<F P=106> [Report by Jozsef Rakos: "One Out of Two Ministries"] </F>
  [Text] One result of the coalition talks is that two 
ministries will be merged. According to the explanation, the 
Ministry of International Economic Relations (NGKM) is 
unnecessary because the market is unified, and there is not a 
domestic and a foreign market. Therefore, it will be dismantled 
and most of it will be inherited by the future economics 
ministry. 
  Down to the level of deputy state secretary, the structural 
and supervisory system is the same at the two affected 
ministries -- the Industry and Trade Ministry (IKM) and the KGKM. 
  The two administrations were directed by a total of seven 
deputy state secretaries but, for example in the IKM, the 
National Tourist Office (OIH) was a separate unit and its 
chairman had the rank of head of a main department. Similarly, 
the Office for European Affairs, headed by an administrative 
state secretary, had a special role in the NGKM. 
  The IKM will be the basis of what is to be called the 
economics ministry. In addition to the already mentioned OIH, 
it had four major professional areas: industry, energy, trade, 
and economics. It seems to be expedient to keep the first three 
of these because the fourth organization is almost the same at 
the two ministries. They both have economic, finance, control, 
statistics, and computer sections. 
  Although with different tasks and requirements, both 
ministries have an organizational unit dealing with foreign 
relations, investment, privatization, and joint ventures. In 
addition to this, an international integration main department 
also operates in the IKM under the leadership of the deputy 
secretary of state for trade. 
  According to the news, the NGKM will see the biggest 
changes. 
The ministry will actually be divided up between three 
ministries. The departments dealing with international finance 
and investment policy, and the aid coordination secretariat of 
the OECD will be attached to the Finance Ministry. The Foreign 
Ministry is also to receive part of the NGKM, namely the network 
of the state's trade representations abroad. However, it is 
questionable what to do with the regional main departments 
because all trade representatives belonged to the main 
department of their region. These are most probably to work 
within the framework of the newly established economic ministry. 
  The fate of the Office for European Affairs is the biggest 
question. The 50-member organization was established to 
coordinate integration into Europe 
  In all Western European countries, independent ministries or 
similar offices were established to help ease the entry to the 
European Community. However, actual membership was arranged by 
the foreign ministries and, since neither the Hungarian 
Socialist Party nor the Alliance of Free Democrats wants to set 
up an integration office with a minister without portfolio, this 
office will probably also be attached to the Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] The National Council of the Alliance of Free

principles of joint governing with the Hungarian Socialist Party

the SZDSZ National Council the agreement received 50 votes in 
favor and five against. Four people abstained from voting. 
Party Chairman Ivan Petoe said that those SZDSZ members who 
cast their vote against the coalition agreement objected to the 
negotiations with the MSZP in the first place. The SZDSZ 
delegates assembly is not going to change the text of the 
coalition agreement.

  [Text] [Announcer] It will be decided today whether the 
coalition agreement concluded the day before yesterday between 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free 
Democrats [SZDSZ] will be valid. The two parties' chief 
decisionmaking forums, the MSZP's congress and the SZDSZ's 
delegates assembly, are to vote on the coalition agreement 
today, on the basis of the recommendations of the parties' 
leading bodies. The MSZP congress began a few hours before our 
broadcast with the speech of Gyula Horn, party chairman and 
prime minister designate. The reporter is Kata Peli Nagy: 
  [Nagy] The party chairman and the party congress are 
satisfied with the coalition agreement, which, in the view of 
the party leaders, they were able to conclude without making 
concessions on a single principle. 
  Party Chairman Gyula Horn, in a speech of nearly an hour, 
again highlighted the agreement's historic significance. He 
said that if the two parties' chief delegate bodies approve it, 
this will be the first social-liberal government in central 
Europe -- what is more, between two parties which prior to 1990 
were sharply opposed to one another. 
  At the same time Gyula Horn found it worth mentioning the 
fact that with this agreement it is not the SZDSZ that has 
rendered the MSZP fit for polite society; it was the voters who 
gave the MSZP its legitimacy. What is more, it gained an 
absolute majority. In spite of this, the party offered a 
coalition to the SZDSZ. 
  There was total agreement with the SZDSZ in that the country 
must be put onto the path of modernization, while social 
viewpoints are taken fully into consideration. 
  The agreement has no secret clauses, and even taken as a 
whole it is a good example. Simply on its own, it is a 
guarantee that there can be no repetition of a coalition similar 
to the one in 1990 [between the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the 
Christian Democratic People's Party, and the Independent 
Smallholders Party], the party chairman said. 
  The coalition agreement, Gyula Horn said, could be a good 
foundation for a new political culture. The essence of this is 
that the two parties offer the losing parties reconciliation 
[megbekeles] and constructive cooperation. 
  The agreement, incidentally, was also received favorably by 
the international political public, at least according to the 
party chairman. 
  Concerning international affairs, Gyula Horn said activities 
which offend the Hungarian minorities beyond the borders would 
not be ignored by the next government, either. His party 
considers it inconceivable to have relations with a party that 
for example defends, and furthermore supports, the [Mayor 
Gheorghe] Funar type of actions in Cluj-Napoca [Kolozsvar]. 
  Finally, in connection with the government list, Gyula Horn 
said the cabinet consists of competent [hozzaertoe] people, 
although it is not easy to find experts for government 
functions.

  [Excerpts] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] Congress 
and the delegate assembly of the Alliance of Free Democrats 
[SZDSZ] have adopted, both with a large majority, the coalition 
agreement reached two days ago. Kata Peli Nagy reports on the 
circumstances of the ballot at the MSZP congress. 
  [Nagy] [passage omitted] According to Gyula Horn, the 
agreement promises a predictable policy that focuses on people, 
which is sociologically well-grounded and which intends to 
modernize. [passage omitted] 
  Gyula Horn sees the basis on which the government program is 
founded as neither liberal, nor left-wing, but a realistic one. 
It is unequivocally clear from the document that the coalition 
wants a social market economy, it is enterprise-friendly, and 
encourages foreign investment. Its strategic aim is to speedily 
join the West European organizations, to establish 
good-neighborly relations with countries surrounding Hungary, 
and to support as far as possible the Hungarians living as 
minorities. 
  Gyula Horn, who is the MSZP candidate for the post of prime 
minister, views his upcoming government as a government of 
experts despite the concessions he had to make during the 
negotiations with the SZDSZ. 
  Horn said that finding state secretaries for the ministers 
will be next week's task. In connection with this I have 
learned that no candidates have been found as yet for filling 
the state secretarial posts that were originally offered to 
Gyorgy Janosi and Sandor Csintalan. Janosi rejected the post of 
state secretary at the Ministry of Culture and Public Education, 
while Csintalan refused the post of state secretary at the 
Ministry of Labor that Mrs. Kosa, nee Magda Kovacs, candidate 
for the post of minister of labor, offered him. 
  Pal Vastagh, candidate for the post of justice minister, has 
also failed to find a state secretary. MSZP Deputy Chairman 
Ferenc Baja has asked Katalin Szili to accept the post of state 
secretary at the Ministry of Environmental Protection. 
  Csaba Tabajdi has been nominated for the state secretarial 
post of chairman of the Office of Hungarians Beyond the Border 
and the National and Ethnic Minorities Office--the two offices 
will be merged. 
  MSZP Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres was elected as leader of 
the MSZP group of parliamentary deputies at the congress this 
afternoon. [passage omitted] The group decided on the people it 
will delegate to posts of chairmen and deputy chairmen of the 
parliamentary committees: 
  Sandor Orosz--chairman of the Agricultural Committee; 
  Judit Csehak--chairwoman of the Social Affairs Committee; 
  Etele Barath--chairwoman of the Environmental Protection; 
  Ivan Vitanyi--chairman of the Cultural Committee; 
  Gabor Gellert Kis--chairman of the Human Rights Committee; 
  Gyorgy Janosi--chairman of the Education Committee; 
  Sandor Nagy--chairman of the Audit Committee; 
  Jozsef Alajos Geczi--chairman of the Parliamentary 
Immunity Committee.

  [Excerpts] Gyula Horn has described as historic the 
coalition agreement on the basis of which a social-liberal 
government can be established. Among other things, I asked the 
MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] prime minister designate [Gyula 
Horn] about this after yesterday's MSZP congress. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] [passage 
omitted] We know that this government has to take very tough 
economic steps to sort out the country's economy. When do you 
think these steps have to be taken? Can steps of this nature be 
delayed? 
  [Horn] [passage omitted] The difficulties are just ahead of 
us. By difficulties I mean the country's extremely serious 
crisis, because that is what we are talking about. The 
financial burdens and financial liabilities are enormous. The 
next government's room for maneuver is extremely narrow. There 
is a lot we do not yet know, and I have to admit I am afraid 
that the next government will be surprised at a lot of things. 
  [Correspondent] What kind of surprises are you thinking of? 
Do you think the outgoing government has not given sufficient 
information? 
  [Horn] When we studied the documents we asked for and which 
were promised by [Prime Minister] Peter Boross, we found that 
the documents did not give a realistic picture of 1994, 
especially of what can be expected in the second half of 1994 
and what obligations fall on the next government, which is the 
successor of the previous government in this sense. We are not 
supposed to break any law or agreement made by the previous 
government. [passage omitted] 
  At the same time, we want to speed up and widen the 
opportunities in international relations which, in our view, can 
help realize the tasks of modernization. Very urgent meetings 
and international negotiations are indispensable for this with 
partners such as Germany or Austria, or -- of a totally 
different nature -- with Slovakia. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] [passage omitted] It was five years ago that 
you, with Alois Mock, cut through the Iron Curtain. [passage 
omitted] I could say there is something symbolic in your 
becoming prime minister in Hungary five years after this. But I 
think it will be quite difficult to surpass that achievement. Am 
I wrong? 
  [Horn] [passage omitted] I am interested in only one thing 
-- 
that we fully meet our commitments toward the electorate, the 
country. [passage omitted] We would like to achieve prosperity 
for the 10.5 million strong Hungarian nation [magyarsag] living 
within our national borders, whether they voted for us or not. 
This is our mission. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] The presidium of the Christian Democratic People's 
Party [KDNP] has resigned. At a session of its national 
executive, Party Chairman Laszlo Surjan described the party's 
election performance as a fiasco, in spite of the fact that this 
time it received more votes than four years ago. The departing 
leader pointed out that the KDNP leadership must be renewed, and 
that this is why the presidium has quit its mandate.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Slovak Foreign Affairs Minister </F>
Eduard Kukan by an unidentified correspondent; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] Eduard Kukan said that his official visit to three 
Arab countries, which to a certain extent followed the January 
official visit to Israel of Jozef Moravcik, who was then Slovak 
foreign minister, had two main objectives. 
  The first was to demonstrate Slovak support for the Middle 
East peace process, although our country does not overestimate 
its influence on developments in this region. What was more 
important was to demonstrate interest in developing mutual 
relations, which had been stagnating after the demise of 
Czechoslovakia, as well as a certain enhancement of the economic 
dimension of our foreign policy. 
  The Arab world is a prospective trade partner and is very 
interested in cooperating with our country. This was confirmed, 
among other things, for example, during the talks our foreign 
minister had with Egyptian President Mubarak and Syrian 
President al-Asad. 
  It should be added in this connection that the Slovak 
economy 
has a chance of stepping up cooperation with the Palestinian 
autonomous regions, which will start building their 
infrastructure in the near future. Through Egypt or Jordan, our 
companies might start getting involved even in this direction.

<F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party Chairman Pavol Hagyari by </F>
Anna Lenicka; place and date not given: "I Am No Demigod"] 
  [Text] Those who do not wish him well are spreading the 
story that he bought the Democratic Party [DS]. In its 
headquarters on Sancova Street, he works in an office he 
inherited. With its customary modern furnishings, it would 
probably give the impression of being run-of-the-mill and most 
of all impersonal, if it were not for the small penguin sitting 
on one of the black cabinets. This creature, which moves so 
awkwardly on the ground, is exceptionally nimble in water. Will 
the reinvented DS maneuver as nimbly in the political waters as 
its mascot? 
  [Hagyari] I believe so, but our mascot represents, above 
all, 
a gentleman. Gentlemen, not boxers, should go into politics. The 
penguin is a decent, unaggressive creature, capable of 
overcoming extremely difficult conditions with extreme ease. 
  [Lenicka] On the same floor, just a few steps from where you 
are, is the editorial office of the weekly journal MOSTY 
[Bridges]. Don't you think we are unnecessarily burning those 
bridges that still connect us with the Czech Republic? 
  [Hagyari] That is why our foreign policy follows the Czech 
foreign policy. It is out of the question that we could join 
West Europe without the Czechs, but the Czechs can join even 
without us. 
  [Lenicka] Isn't a tactical election move hiding behind your 
parcel of concrete initiatives for closer cooperation with that 
republic? 
  [Hagyari] Certainly it is a tactical election move. I do not 
do anything without a reason. 
  [Lenicka] But the Czech side reacted neurotically not only 
to 
your initiatives, but also to the installation of Moravcik's 
government, being concerned whether, along with it, goes a 
renewed pro-Czechoslovak sentiment or an attempt to establish a 
confederation.... 
  [Hagyari] No, I do not see any reason that anyone should 
feel 
uneasy about it, and I do not have any information about 
anything like that. Only Mr. Klaus reacted to it that way. The 
Czech Government, as far as I know, did not take a position on 
it. Our proposals for improving cooperation will benefit all 
Slovak citizens. In the political area, for example, we want to 
give the citizens of the other state the very same rights our 
citizens have. For example, the right to vote at the municipal 
level, with the exception of parliamentary elections and 
military service. This is common in West Europe. In the area of 
education, we want our people to have the possibility to study 
in the Czech Republic and vice versa, and to be compensated for 
it by the individual governments. As far as cultural matters are 
concerned, we could consider, among other things, a joint 
television program or a joint radio broadcast, which would 
certainly help to maintain good relations with the Czech 
Republic. 
  [Lenicka] We cannot concede that Slovakia is a near 
abroad--similar discomfitted reactions all the way to flat 
rejections were heard mostly from the Civic Democratic Party 
[ODS] politicians, with whom you cooperate closely. Most 
recently with the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA], which won 
seats only in the Czech National Council [CNR], and that, too, 
thanks to the "Slovak matter" is not too "favorably inclined" 
toward us.... 
  [Hagyari] I do not think I agree with you. Mr. Kalvoda asked 
the Slovak side several times just to say clearly what it 
wants--federation, confederation, or independent states. Nothing 
else. When I talked with him unofficially at the ODA congress, 
he welcomed our initiative. He said that, as soon as he gets to 
the government level, he will personally support it. Similarly 
Mr. Dlouhy. I admit that I did not talk about it with Mr. Klaus. 
The realization of this plan requires that both governments be 
compatible. After all, only in the Czech Republic is there a 
civic right-wing government, whereas in Slovakia the national 
left was in the government. 
  [Lenicka] You consider the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia 
[HZDS] the national left? Are you not worried about the 
prediction of the chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left 
[SDL] that the Slovak right will not grow out of Hagyari's DS 
but from the vulgar, populist HZDS? 
  [Hagyari] We shall see after the elections. I respect 
comrade 
Weiss as a man who placed himself at the head of a party that 
had 800,000 members. It is easier for him to build from 
something, and when, for 40 years, he was an administrator here. 
It is another thing to build a civic right wing. I am surprised 
that Mrs. Schmognerova is following rightist, so-called 
antisocial politics.... 
  [Lenicka] Are you saying that rightist politics are 
antisocial? 
  [Hagyari] What is one to call what they are doing? They 
defend the interests of the workers, and they say about us that 
we are antisocial. And all of a sudden, Mrs. Schmognerova is 
more rightist than Ivan Miklos or Dzurinda. 
  [Lenicka] In what way is she more rightist? 
  [Hagyari] Note the cuts in social programs that she is 
making 
in an effort to keep as many resources as possible for the state 
budget! 
  [Lenicka] If you were in her place, could you afford not to 
make cuts, given the kind of shortfall that exists in the state 
budget today? 
  [Hagyari] No, we embrace that policy. We maintain that we 
can 
spend on social programs only when we can afford it. 
  [Lenicka] You also assert that the difference between the 
left and the right is that the left distributes and the right 
contributes. Isn't this too cheap a shot? Don't you think that, 
when the SDL insists on implementing certain unpopular measures, 
without which the revival of the economy would be unthinkable, 
that it does so precisely for the benefit of the working people? 
That a postponement of these steps would be antipeople? 
  [Hagyari] I agree that no other solution exists. We evaluate 
the course of action of this government positively, in spite of 
the fact that, from the politico-logical standpoint, the 
government is more to the left. 
  [Lenicka] L. Kovac, the former minister of education in the 
first post-November government, therefore from circles close to 
you, came to the conclusion during the polemic touched off by J. 
Carnogusky's strict rejection of liberalism that Slovak 
conservatism has always been reactionary. Reactionary in the 
sense that it solved problems with delays measured in tens, 
sometimes even hundreds, of years.... Will you reverse this 
trend? How will you convince the citizens that, as a 
conservative party, you are offering a modern program? 
  [Hagyari] There is a great difference between us and the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH]. Especially in the fact 
that, while it addresses itself to Christian-oriented people, we 
are for everybody--without regard to sex, age, education, or 
religious affiliation. The greatest difference between us is the 
fact that our stance on abortion is definitely more liberal. In 
contrast to the KDH, which, as is known, calls for strict 
prohibition of abortions, we think that a woman must make her 
own decision. Another difference between us and the KDH is the 
way we view the Slovak State of 1939-45. In our opinion, it was 
a satellite of fascist Germany, and one has to take a stance on 
history accordingly. As far as parties are concerned, we are 
closest to the ODS or ODA. 
  [Lenicka] But there are more sticking points in the dialogue 
between the Slovak secular and religious right. If one could 
have said until recently that it was the KDH that was impeding 
this dialogue, now the situation appears to be turning around. 
As if you were the ones impeding it. 
  [Hagyari] Who told you that? 
  [Lenicka] Press that is favorably inclined toward you. I 
even 
read there that the only problem that prevents the creation of a 
clearly defined and unified right-wing bloc is Hagyari's DS. 
  [Hagyari] That is an interesting opinion, but it is not 
based 
on any realistic premises. I do not know of any politician on 
the Slovak political scene who is more pragmatic than I. In the 
year and a half that I have been in politics, we succeeded in 
uniting, under my leadership, six right-of-center political 
entities. My politics are realistic and pragmatic; I am ready to 
meet others halfway. I was the one who a year ago said that we 
must create a large right-of-center bloc. That would ensure that 
every voter would find his own leader and his own party, and 
that not even one right-wing vote would be wasted. In this 
respect, one can only take one's hat off to the left-wing 
parties, which so quickly and without any problems came to an 
agreement. A sane mind would say that we can do likewise on the 
right. So far, that has not happened, but I firmly believe that 
somehow things will be settled and we shall find a common 
language. 
  [Lenicka] But the Cernak people do not hide their antagonism 
toward your profederation orientation. The Moravcik people's 
ambition is to get into the parliament on their own, similarly 
Randa's party of small businessmen. Obviously, it will not be 
possible to create even a counterbalance to the religious 
right--the KDH, let alone a unified right-wing bloc. 
  [Hagyari] There are a number of possibilities. We can also 
accept the KDH offer to put our top people who are running for 
office on their slate of candidates, but that carries certain 
risks. In the sense that not everybody will be ready to accept 
I. Miklos and me on that slate as long as they harbor, for 
whatever reason, a certain distrust of the KDH and distance 
themselves from it. From opinion polls, we know that the 
majority of our sympathizers do not want to accept the KDH. And 
it really is questionable whether they would accept having us on 
their slate of candidates. There is still the possibility of 
creating a bloc of civic-oriented right-wing parties if the KDH 
goes into the elections on its own. It there is no other 
possibility and the executive council comes to the conclusion 
that our presence on the KDH ticket will be the best way, we 
will act accordingly. We think that there is not that much 
difference in voter preference for us and for the KDH that we 
need to accept the KDH proposal immediately. 
  [Lenicka] But you still have not crossed the mandatory 
5-percent threshold. Your risk is greater. When will you make a 
definitive decision? 
  [Hagyrai] It depends on the offer of the KDH, which is still 
very unspecific. It did not tell us whether it is offering us 
five of 10 slots, for which positions, etc. That is one thing. 
It depends on our executive council, which will meet on the 
penultimate Saturday in May. I assure you that I will do all I 
can to see to it that not even one vote is wasted. 
  [Lenicka] Do you make so bold as to convince voters in case 
you will be courting them on your own? 
  [Hagyari] That is a premature question. That will depend on 
what the voter preferences are in May and June. We want to 
demand more television time so we can address at least the 10 
percent of sympathizers whom we united. 
  [Lenicka] Do you consider the fusion of the KDS and the DS 
into the DS the final stop? 
  [Hagyari] No, I maintain that life will always find the best 
way, that it will reject anything that is artificial, unnatural. 
  [Lenicka] You decided on the old, tried-and-true logo. 
However, ingrained in the mind of our public is the DS, with its 
"sunflower effect." Moreover, in the leadership of the party are 
people who are too closely connected with Public Against 
Violence [VPN], transformed into the Civic Democratic Union 
[ODU], which perished because it was held in disfavor even by 
voters with rightist views. Don't you think that certain 
psychological barriers will again play a role? 
  [Hagyari] I do not know what barriers you have in mind 
because Ivan Miklos is an economist par excellence. Today's DS 
is not the DS that was marked by the sunflower effect. We have a 
clear program of conservative democrats who place a clear 
emphasis on economic reform, and we are oriented toward the 
European Democratic Union [EDU]. We have completed our party 
structures. We want to convince Slovakia--and do not be offended 
now--that it is rightist, even though in the last election it 
voted for the left. 
  [Lenicka] For the time being, Slovakia is not like that. 
Why, 
in your opinion, does it not believe in rightist values? 
  [Hagyari] It is a matter of personalities. 
  [Lenicka] Are you saying that the right has too few 
personalities? 
  [Hagyari] Yes. In addition, it is unable to convince the 
citizens. It is not the nation that is dumb and bad but the 
politician who does not manage to address it. How we can address 
it is another matter. We can go from door to door, which we are 
doing, but the media are decisive. As long as television does 
not give me enough time so that I can express my views in 
comparison to others and have the citizen choose, I can hardly 
become a personality. The media, and especially television, can 
make a personality into a zero or a zero into a personality. We 
often appear in private, local media, but, unfortunately, 
television is providing us with too little time. We consider it 
discrimination against the civic right wing in Slovakia. And it 
would be a good thing if Slovakia had a balanced political 
scene, which so far is overwhelmingly left-wing. We see that the 
KDH, with all due respect to the KDH and the 70 percent of 
Catholics, speaks only to one-tenth of them. 
  [Lenicka] ODU and the original DS left a debt of more than 
2.5 million korunas. Are you going to settle it? 
  [Hagyari] I was never a member of ODU. 
  [Lenicka] But many of its people are members of your party. 
  [Hagyari] Ask Langos or Porubak about that.... 
  [Lenicka] Not your deputy chairman at the time, Ivan Miklos? 
He was not in ODU? 
  [Hagyari] He was, but I do not think he was the chairman.... 
We assumed the debt left by the old DS, and we are paying it 
off. I see no reason to have anyone suffer a loss on anyone's 
account. 
  [[Lenicka] Are you planning to borrow money for these 
elections? Do you think there should be a limit on the amount 
spent on campaigning? 
  [Hagyari] I will not borrow money. Limits are unnecessary 
because there are many ways to get around such a law. A law that 
has loopholes is useless. 
  [Lenicka] You already used one superlative--sense for 
pragmatism--to praise yourself. Are there others? And what about 
the weak points? 
  [Hagyari] I will not tell you about the weak points. I am 
exactly the way the citizens of Slovakia are. I am not any 
smarter, nor am I any dumber. I know exactly what bothers them. 
I am no demigod, even if I think we have a program to solve 
Slovakia's problems. 
  [Lenicka] You went into politics only recently. To do that, 
you left a lucrative job--adviser on legal matters. Why? 
  [Hagyari] Yes, I gave up my work as a lawyer. It is because 
everything I do I want to do well. I decided to give all of my 
energy to returning the civic right to the parliament and 
eventually to the government. Unfortunately, politics does not 
have logic. You cannot always persuade people by logical 
arguments. Since the 1992 elections, people have become much 
worse off--there are no medicines, physicians receive minimum 
wages, one must pay for schoolbooks in the schools, tuition will 
be charged in institutions of higher learning, lunch programs 
will be canceled.... When we realize that inflation is at 30 
percent but pensions rose by only 6 percent, that privatization 
was halted and when it was resumed it changed into a giveaway to 
loyal subjects, etc., etc., therefore, when you look at any 
area, the situation has deteriorated, and, in spite of that, a 
certain movement's popularity is on the rise. I found out after 
being in politics for several months that politics has no logic. 
Few people can imagine what terribly hard work it is to build a 
party with a solid structure, clear objectives, and orientation.

  [Text] In New York, President Michal Kovac confirmed the 
government's intention to vigorously continue the privatization 
process during his meeting with representatives of Merrill 
Lynch, an important U.S. investment and consulting company. 
Kovac considers the inability to analyze economic processes 
with sufficient precision as well as the poorly defined concept 
of a long-term orientation to be the reason for the slowdown in 
the transformation process last year. We consider the emergence 
of businesses that are able to develop and survive in the 
international market environment to be the main privatization 
objective, said Kovac, who is continuing his visit to the United 
States.

<F P=106> [Interview with Milan Janicina, minister for privatization </F>
and the administration of national property, by Ivan Podstupka; 
place and date not given: "Enterprises Are Avoiding 
Privatization"] 
  [Text] There is no doubt that privatization is at the 
center of the transformation of the economy. After the rapid 
start in 1992, its tempo slowed down, and preferences for 
individual methods changed. The current government stresses 
that all of the privatization methods will be used and that they 
will be equal. However, this contradicts the statement provided 
by Milan Janicina, the Slovak Republic's minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property, that 
direct sales will be used only in specific cases. 
  [Janicina] I meant putting standard and nonstandard methods 
on an equal footing. The coupon method is nonstandard, and 
there are three standard methods: public auction, public 
tender, and sale to a person designated in advance--that is, 
direct sales. Public tender is transparent, but direct sales 
were, are, and will be a subject for speculation. This is why 
we want to restrict it, but we cannot entirely avoid it. All of 
the cases so far have involved enterprises in bad economic 
situations. We can either launch bankruptcy proceedings against 
them, or a prospective buyer will emerge who will pledge to 
revive the enterprise. The second case is more advantageous. 
Moreover, budget-funded organizations cannot be liquidated. We 
have to sell them and also consider the system of installments. 
A different case would be to sell it to a solvent foreign 
investor. The National Property Fund has obligations and needs 
money, and a public tender can take several months. We do not 
want to push direct sales into the background, but, within the 
standard methods, we want to use them only in justified cases. 
  [Podstupka] There will be a second wave of coupon 
privatization. It will not be easy to raise 88 billion 
[korunas] worth of property.... 
  [Janicina] We are short of 37 billion. I believe that we 
have time until the end of July to reach this volume. So far, 
health facilities, half of the agricultural enterprises, and 
some of the Ministry of the Economy's enterprises have not been 
included. We are counting on 17 billion worth of property in 
energy-generating and gas enterprises, despite the fact that, 
according to Minister Magvasi, the privatization of the 
energy-generating and gas industry should be organized in a 
separate law. 
  [Podstupka] The positions of your ministry and the Ministry 
of the Economy differ. Is it possible to overcome this 
difference? 
  [Janicina] I believe that the difference is not as great as 
they say. There are two extreme opinions. According to the 
first one, the privatization of the energy-generating and gas 
industry means the virtual disintegration of the state, while 
the other points to the example of the well-functioning British 
private energy-generating and gas industry. It is possible to 
agree with Minister Magvasi that our state is young, and 
intervention has to be done carefully. This is why 
privatization should be implemented gradually. Enterprises 
should be transformed into large shareholding companies, which 
would then establish branch subsidiaries. 
  [Podstupka] It is expected that state-owned shareholders' 
companies will be anchored in the law.... 
  [Janicina] I have the feeling that this would be a step 
backward, a turn toward socialist privatization. We have to 
make clear what state ownership participation is. As far as I 
know, a certain respectable legal firm is preparing a draft of 
this law for the Ministry of the Economy. It is slowly getting 
into a legislative and legal shakeup. In no case will this be 
easy. The strategic interest of the state can be secured if the 
National Property Fund has the controlling volume of shares. 
However, the National Property Fund was drafted as a certain 
catalyst of privatization and, after privatization is completed, 
should wither away. There are fears that it could become a kind 
of superministry, a super planning commission, and, moreover, an 
entrepreneurial subject with enormous assets. This is a great 
danger. This is why it is possible to abolish the National 
Property Fund at a certain stage of transformation by 
transferring the shares securing strategic interests of the 
state to a state body--the Ministry of the Economy, in this 
case. I would like to comment here that, on the part of the 
Ministry of the Economy of the Slovak Republic, we can feel the 
residue of what used to be the "ministerial" attitude: We are 
big, and we must control. 
  [Podstupka] Why are some of these enterprises being 
privatized by the coupon method? The state is being deprived of 
certain income. 
  [Janicina] Simply to improve the average quality of shares 
that are in coupon privatization. We cannot give only garbage 
to the people. The previous government believed the coupon 
method was marginal. They were to pick the raisins from the 
cake to sell them, and the rest, which no one wanted, would be 
put into coupon privatization. This is not what we want. In 
the policy statement, the government pledged also to offer 
prospering enterprises in coupon privatization, so we have to 
fulfill it. 
  [Podstupka] The second wave of coupon privatization will 
begin in the fall--that is, after the elections. Could a change 
in political power slow it down, change it, or stop it? 
  [Janicina] It could theoretically happen that a government 
that is completely against coupon privatization would assume 
power. Such a government would have problems because it would 
discredit itself at home and abroad. It is certain that, if 
that government had 90 deputies in parliament, it could order 
anything, even a return to socialism. In that case, I would 
fear for the fate of coupon privatization. 
  [Podstupka] Is the Privatization Ministry, after all of the 
changes and reorganizations, prepared for the second wave of 
coupon privatization? 
  [Janicina] I believe it is, as regards the personnel. We 
have certain problems with founding ministries, particularly 
regarding coordination with privatized enterprises. Some 
enterprises are doing everything to avoid privatization. They 
do not cooperate when completing ownership-related legal 
documents, particularly referring to real estate. We must 
overcome this. I have issued an order that every enterprise 
that is 60-percent prepared must go ahead with privatization. 
It will be transformed into a shareholding company, and, 
according to Section 15 of the law on large-scale privatization, 
the concomitant rights will be transferred onto it. 
  [Podstupka] Is cooperation with the National Property Fund 
all right? 
  [Janicina] Coordination could be better, but we cannot 
complain. It would be better if we had personnel connection 
between the National Property Fund management and the ministry. 
Not on the ministerial level, but it would be good if we 
returned to the situation where the deputy minister was the 
chairman of the National Property Fund Presidium. 
  [Podstupka] What will be the fate of the enterprises whose 
decision about direct sale, made by the previous government, was 
abolished by the current government? 
  [Janicina] Developments will tell us whether they will be 
sold directly or by public tender. One sale has already been 
made--the sale of the Nuclear Power Station Research Institute. 
It was sold to the same people to whom it had been sold under 
Meciar's government. The project was only completed by missing 
data. Despite the fact that my resistance to the Employees' 
Stock Ownership Plan for Companies is known, in this case I had 
no objections. Only 5 percent will go to the management, and 
the rest to other employees.

<F P=106> [Article by Jozef Hajko: "Voucher Privatization Will Become </F>
Catalyst of Further Changes"] 
  [Text] The almost forgotten voucher privatization is 
beginning to take on realistic dimensions after the report on 
its planning was discussed by the government. The expectation is 
that it will become an accelerating element of the entire 
transformation and restructuring process in Slovakia. 
  Although the government discussed this report of the 
Ministry 
of Privatization, the precise amount of state properties 
destined for voucher privatization is not yet known. The 
Minister for the Management and Privatization of the Slovak 
Republic [SR] National Property, Milan Janicina, set the target 
too high, and, in the list of enterprises to be sold for 
vouchers, he included assets in the face value of 170 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk]. At the same time, he himself expects that 
the offer will include properties in the value of Sk80-100 
billion. The definite number will become known only after a 
register of shares is worked out with the founding ministries 
and after an agreement is reached with the SR National Property 
Fund [FNM], which administers stock in the value of Sk20 
billion, which can also be offered to the citizens for their 
vouchers. 
  The application of the voucher method, for which the 
know-how 
of Czecho-Slovak--and therefore also Slovak--economists is being 
put to use, has its advantages as well as disadvantages. 
  Among the disadvantages of the voucher method can be 
mentioned especially the subsequent unavoidable concentration of 
economic power of key owners in individual companies and the 
laborious process of acquiring the means for investments. If it 
is the objective of the state to also contribute money for 
privatization, then the voucher privatization brings another 
disadvantage--it will not fill the FNM coffers. 
  In the current state of crisis in the Slovak economy, when 
many state enterprises are on the brink of collapse, 
privatization (even by means of bankruptcies) appears as the 
only solution that will achieve long-term rectification. The 
oppressive global economic climate in which independent Slovakia 
found itself, and almost two years of marking time without any 
concept about what to do (not only) in privatization, is 
dragging into bankruptcy even many promising private enterprises. 
  Privatization is inevitable because, as has been true from 
time immemorial, people value and improve only private property. 
The voucher method today is seen as an inevitability. There are 
three reasons for that. 
  First of all, its advantages outweigh its disadvantages: 
voucher privatization is relatively quick, clear-cut, just, and 
undemanding of domestic credit resources. It makes it possible 
to avoid putting a financial burden on the new owner, who, when 
a standard method is used, must pay for the purchase of the 
privatized property. For a broad application of the standard 
methods--direct sales, public competitions, and auctions--there 
is simply not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, and, 
unltimately, even time. 
  The second reason is the necessity of introducing a firm and 
conceptual approach into the transformation process. The 
Ministry of Privatization as well as the other ministries, when 
approving plans for the second wave of voucher privatization, 
will finally be faced with having to make a decision on how to 
privatize the Slovak state enterprises. It does not mean that 
all of their assets will be sold for vouchers. In each 
individual case, as M. Janicina emphasizes, individual decisions 
will be made, which will often call for the use of the standard 
methods as well. The important thing is that, after two years of 
unjustifiable foot-dragging, such decisions will finally be 
made. That will at the same time solve the problem of strategic 
interest of the state in individual branches of the economy, 
when the highest executive power will have to define what is the 
intended permanent share of the state in the assets of selected 
enterprises. That will indirectly force the government to define 
the economic orientation of Slovakia in future years. 
  The third, no less important, reason for using the voucher 
method is to generate public confidence in the transformation 
process. If the citizen has the possibility of sharing in the 
privatization, he will get the justified feeling that the state 
is treating him fairly. In addition, he will also gain 
materially. And social peace is one of the few favorable entry 
elements on which the macroeconomists and politicians in 
Slovakia can count. 
<H5>  [Box, p 2] </H5>
  Voucher privatization today appears to be inevitable. There 
are three reasons: 
  1. For direct sales, public competions, and auctions there 
is 
not enough domestic credit, interest from abroad, or time. 
  2. Transformation requires a resolute and conceptual 
approach. 
  3. The voucher method will instill in the citizens 
confidence 
in the transformation process.

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Temporary Growth of Deficit"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--The deficit of the state budget of the 
Slovak Republic in the first five months of this year developed 
more favorably than expected. By 31 May 1994, it declined to 
2.29 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] (from Sk3.8 billion at the end 
of April). As of 21 June 1994, the budget management of the 
Slovak Republic has been showing a deficit of Sk7.9 billion. 
This sum will, however, decrease by the end of the month 
because the surrendering of proceeds from the crucial taxes--the 
value-added tax and excise taxes--starts after the 23d day of 
every month. An analysis of the current deviation in the budget 
management of the Slovak Republic confirms that it is also 
influenced by the changed position of the Slovak Republic in the 
fulfillment of the payments agreement with the Czech Republic 
because Slovakia has now become the Czech Republic's creditor.

<F P=106> [Article by TA SR: "Less Assistance, Higher </F>
Payments...Slovak Agriculture Still on the Road to Collapse?"] 
  [Text] Bratislava (TA SR)--Earnings from the sale of 
primary agricultural production in Slovakia reached 30.8 billion 
Slovak korunas [Sk] in 1993. In comparison with 1992, it 
represents a decline of Sk4.2 billion (12 percent). The report 
on this situation was provided by the chairman of the Slovak 
Chamber of the Agricultural and Food Industry, Jozef Juhas. 
Costs in primary agricultural production rose by Sk1.8 billion, 
to Sk49.4 billion, in 1993, from Sk47.6 billion in 1992. 
Indebtedness after the due date, arising from business 
transactions, increased by Sk800 million and reached Sk7.2 
billion, while accounts receivable increased by Sk550 million to 
more than Sk6 billion. The difference between accounts payable 
and accounts receivable is more than Sk1.1 billion, to the 
disadvantage of primary agricultural production. 
  Granted investment credit declined from Sk991 million in 
1992 
to Sk324 million in 1993. The investment activity of 
agricultural enterprises also declined. Material investments 
declined from Sk4.2 billion in 1992 to Sk3.8 billion in 1993, 
within that amount construction work almost by half--from Sk2.2 
billion to Sk1.3 billion. In spite of the fact that the volume 
of total loans and assistance fell from Sk13.3 billion in 1992 
to last year's Sk12.1 billion in 1993--that is, by Sk1.2 
billion--agricultural enterprises paid Sk4.6 billion in 
installment payments and Sk2.2 billion in interest. In 
comparison with 1992, this is an increase of Sk310 million.

<F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Bohumil Gerinca, director of the </F>
Defense and Security Department of the Slovak Government Office, 
by Peter Sporer; place and date not given: Armex Is Not an 
Alternative to Omnipol in Slovakia"] 
  [Text] [Sporer] In Slovakia, the selling of arms is often 
talked and written about only in hints. How is this fact 
perceived by a man who should have, by virtue of his top 
position in the government commission for granting licenses for 
the export and import of arms, a sufficient overview of this 
matter? 
  [Gerinca] Every dealer tries to find a buyer, and, when he 
finds one, he tries to keep his name a secret because there are 
many possible ways in which to disrupt a potential deal. The 
producer or the seller, not to mention the buyer, therefore 
prefers not to talk about it. I believe that so far it has been 
a good thing for Slovakia, too, that less was said and more was 
done in this respect. 
  [Sporer] Done? But if we take into account the small amount 
of spare parts manufactured in our arms factories (about 5 
percent of the original volume of production before conversion) 
that the factory managers are declaring, then not even the 
"doing" could not have involved sales on a large scale. 
  [Gerinca] I agree. And, besides those, only surplus 
equipment 
from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic [SR] was 
being sold, and that is basically coming slowly to an end--in 
view of the time limits set by international agreements. 
  [Sporer] The heavy weapons manufactured in Slovakia were 
sold 
by the state through Omnipol. Omnipol was represented and still 
is represented mainly by people who today live in the Czech 
Republic--dealers with contacts in specific countries and with 
specific customers. It is logical, therefore, that if, for 
example, an Arab or some other client used to arrange deals over 
dinner with a man from Omnipol, he will not turn today to the 
prime minister or the manager of an arms factory if he wants to 
place an order but again to the person with whom he used to 
deal. Is the loss of Omnipol a big loss? 
  [Gerinca] Not just a loss but also it literally constitutes 
harm to Slovakia's interests. These people, after all, are still 
working for those who pay them, and their priority is to close 
deals that benefit their organization, that benefit Omnipol. 
They sell arms manufactured in the Czech Republic, but they also 
try, naturally, to sell those from other countries--business is 
business--to make the maximum profit for Omnipol, even at the 
cost to our producers. We try to prevent it by creating our own 
system. In Slovakia, only a Slovak firm or basically a legal 
entity can trade in weapons commodities. 
  [Sporer] But can Omnipol participate in the sales in the 
role 
of a middleman? 
  [Gerinca] It must have a middleman from our companies who 
will buy on its behalf. And then Omnipol would proceed with the 
sale. 
  [Sporer] The ideal thing would probably be to get people 
from 
Omnipol to work for a similar firm in Slovakia, wouldn't it? 
  [Gerinca] Omnipol is an established organization. People who 
work there have a certain security. Slovakia does not have a 
similar organization established on world markets. In certain 
ways, our merchants who made a name of sorts for themselves in 
business tried to get those people for themselves. But offering 
something that might be successful in the future was not enough 
compared to a certain thing. 
  [Sporer] From this standpoint, how do you rate the activity 
of the former minister of general engineering and, before that, 
director of the VHJ ZTS [Economic Production Unit Heavy 
Machinery Enterprises], Mr. Luhovy? 
  [Gerinca] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is doing business in 
retirment. He wants to help Slovakia, and he lives in Slovkia. 
  [Sporer] Was he rejected? 
  [Gerinca] No. Of course, the question remains how such help 
can be utilized. I do not know what Mr. Luhovy is doing today. I 
am not in contact with him. 
  [Sporer] As an alternative to Omnipol, the company Armex was 
created in Slovakia almost seven months ago, with the honorary 
deputy chairman of the SNS [Slovak National Party], Vitazoslav 
Moric, named by the government to be its manager. But so far it 
has not been issued a license by your commission.... 
  [Gerinca] It is difficult to comment on it because Armex so 
far has not applied for any license. Obviously it has a reason. 
  [Sporer] A reason? 
  [Gerinca] In the case of Armex, the state retained 
100-percent participation in its business dealings. The idea was 
to create an organization composed of representatives of five 
ministries, whose task would be to assume responsibility for 
trade matters and, as far as possible, a certain coordination of 
these activities. The start of its activities was tied to the 
start of production in the arms factories. However, not even the 
basic prerequisites were present--I have in mind, among other 
things, the question of experience and initiative in the work of 
the people involved--and, as a result, the organization is not 
functioning. It was probably unrealistic to expect anything else 
from state officials who were delegated to take on this duty. 
  [Sporer] Is it within the authority of the government to 
make 
personnel changes in Armex? 
  [Gerinca] Of course. The government created Armex, it named 
its general manager, and it can even dissolve it. 
  [Sporer] How many companies in Slovakia are trading in arms? 
  [Gerinca] It is difficult to give a specific answer because 
there is the matter of getting permission to sell. This is 
granted by the SR Ministry of Interior. When someone is granted 
this permission to sell and buy arms commodities, it can ask the 
government licensing commission to issue a license for these 
activities. But there are also private dealers who sell weapons 
only on SR territory, merely on the basis of a permit to carry 
on a trade--they do not have to have a license. But I emphasize 
that those who want to export or import arms from abroad must 
apply to our commission for a license. This possibility is 
mostly used by firms that trade in short hunting rifles. But a 
license can also be applied for by a company that generally 
trades in other products but wants to do this as an additional 
activity. 
  [Sporer] In the Martin and Dubnice arms factories, they are 
saying that, after the conversion, the territories the Slovaks 
left were taken over by the Poles, and the Russians have become 
very active. In addition, the Czechs, too, by way of the RDP 
Group, are actively trying to market their improved T-72 tank. 
What chance does our heavy-machinery industry have of making a 
comeback? 
  [Gerinca] It is true that the Poles, who did not go in for 
conversion, filled the void. However, the Russians, who never 
stopped developing tanks, already have the production of T-80 
and T-90 tanks on the line. Moreoever, they own an excessive 
amount of equipment. We have to admit that we actually never 
developed new types of tanks, only tanks that were already 
established and that could be, so to speak, "shown"--Herefore, 
also the T-72 tanks. If we want to succeed, somebody will have 
to invest in development. 
  [Sporer] "Somebody" who? 
  [Gerinca] The buyer who is interested in starting 
production. 
Abroad it is a matter of course that this role is assumed by the 
army of the country that manufactures the arms. It rearms itself 
and gradually also gets the opportunity to trade with other 
countries. But the budget of our Army, no matter how high it may 
appear in comparison with other departments, simply does not 
provide the possibility of adding new equipment. Therefore, it 
cannot help in starting up arms production, either. It is, of 
course, another thing when a factory improves and produces, say, 
a tank turret (Dubnica), for which it finds buyers among armies 
equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the managers of arms 
factories to calculate whether a similar trade would be 
profitable for them. 
  [Sporer] There is talk about losses in the tens of billions 
that the state suffered as a result of the conversion. Briefly, 
how can arms factories cover this loss, in your opinion? 
  [Gerinca] Their managers know best about that, but it would 
probably not be appropriate for me to merely reply that the 
yearly turnover in high octane gasoline was about 20 billion 
Czechoslovak korunas. A better example is provided by the people 
from Martin. It is said that, when they manufactured and sold a 
tank, they made as much as they would if they manufactured and 
sold 40 tractors today.

  [Text] Zagreb, Jun 26 (TANJUG) -- Lord David Owen, the 
European Union's mediator for the former Yugoslavia, has warned 
of a danger of the conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina 
turning into an all-out war against the Serbs in both of the 
former Yugoslav republics. 
  Lord Owen and the other co-chairman of the international 
conference on the former Yugoslavia, U.N. mediator Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, arrived in the Croatian capital of Zagreb on 
Saturday evening for talks with Croatian President Franjo 
Tudjman. 
  Lord Owen told the press in Zagreb that "if things went 
wrong 
in Bosnia, there is always a danger of the Bosnian and Croatian 
Serbs link-up, and (of) the Croats and Muslims, and another big 
war involving both Bosnia and Croatia". 
  Serbs proclaimed their national states on historically and 
ethnically their territories in Croatia -- the republic of Serb 
Krajina (RSK), and in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Srpska republic 
(R.S.) in late 1991 and 1992, respectively, that is, after the 
two republics forcibly seceded from the former Yugoslav 
Federation. 
  Lord Owen said that the main topic of the Zagreb talks was 
how to renew the talks between the RSK Serbs and Croatian 
authorities. 
  Lord Owen set out that no date had been set for a new round 
of Croat-Serb talks, which were put off last on June 16. 
  The international negotiator underscored that the talks must 
be held separately from those between the Bosnian Muslims, Serbs 
and Croats. 
  The co-chairmen of the international conference on the 
former 
Yugoslavia visited the capital of The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia (FYROM), Skopje, and Belgrade before arriving in 
Zagreb. They conferred with FYROM President Kiro Gligorov and 
President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia.

  [Text] Knin, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- Branko Vojnica, speaker of 
the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] assembly, has said that 
"relations with Croatia have become very fragile and tense." 
  "Every day we listen to the threats of Croatian leaders that 
they will take Krajina by force. We do not underestimate these 
threats, although in most cases they are caused by internal 
instability in the Republic of Croatia and by the fact that 
President Tudjman himself is trying to mobilize Croats 
politically and in general, hoping to remain in power in this 
way," Vojnica told a TANJUG correspondent. He added: "The fact 
that they are arming themselves with fighter planes and 
helicopters is also not unknown to us." 
  "We have convened a session of the assembly for 1 July and 
one of the items on the agenda -- apart from revisions of 
certain laws relating to the system -- will be an initiative of 
the assembly's defense committee; that is, our stand that the 
RSK army must be given its place in a system which would 
guarantee its citizens peace and stability and which would 
guarantee that Croatia's threats will not be realized," the RSK 
parliament speaker declared. He added: "The priority task of 
the RSK assembly and government is the defense system and the 
consolidation of ties with Serbia, Montenegro, and the Srpska 
republic." 
  Commenting on RSK prime minister Borislav Mikelic's visit to 
Italy, Vojnica said: "The aim of the visit is to examine 
economic ties and exchange views on issues of mutual interest. 
We do not intend to bypass the issue of the provisions of the 
Ossimo Agreement. We support Italy's stands on the revision of 
the Ossimo Agreement; this has now become a public issue in 
Italy. We are against manipulation by anyone where Yugoslavia 
is concerned and where the guarantees that existed earlier are 
concerned. Everything has been disrupted, no one recognizes 
Yugoslavia, and horrific sanctions have been imposed upon it."

  [Text] A delegation of the Turkish Defense Ministry, led by 
Colonel General Teoman Ekran, this morning arrived on a two-day 
visit to the Croatian Defense Ministry. 
  They were welcomed at Zagreb airport by their host Brigadier 
General Antun Tus, military adviser to the Croatian president. 
  On the first day of their visit to Croatia the Turkish 
delegation visited the naval institute in Zagreb. 
  [Begin recording] [Tus] The aim of the visit is come to know 
each other better, to see at what technical and technological 
level we are both at, what production lines we have, what 
expertise and scientific potential we have and to achieve some 
cooperation in future related to the development and production 
of certain systems included in general economic programs and, 
certainly also, some programs which can be significant for the 
defense of the country. [end recording] 
  Questions related to the security in this part of Europe 
were 
also discussed. Croatia's integration in Partnership for Peace 
as soon as possible was on the agenda. 
  The talks are just the beginning of the cooperation between 
the two countries, Col-Gen Teoman Ekran said. 
  [Begin recording] [Ekran, speaking in Turkish, with 
superimposed Croatian translation] As you know, the Republic of 
Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic 
of Croatia. This is a model start for the future cooperation 
between the two countries. Turkey supports Croatian peace 
efforts for the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and lends its 
full support to the Bosnia-Herzegovina federation. 
  After the visit to the naval institute the Turkish 
delegation 
visited Koncar complex. Visits to Karlovac and Turanj are 
scheduled for tomorrow as well as talks with Croatian Defense 
Minister Gojko Susak. [end recording]

  [Text] Despite all peace efforts and realistic views that 
the continuation of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is more 
senseless than ever before, bloody fighting--mainly between the 
Muslim and Serb army and the inter-Muslim conflict in western 
Bosnia--continues. 
  A statement by General Rasim Delic, head of the Muslim army, 
calling on his soldiers to leave trenches and launch an 
offensive to liberate the country was like adding fuel to the 
fire. Here is a commentary by our journalist Ivica Tomic: 
  The Bosnia-Herzegovina army has in these 10 or 15 days of 
truce made large steps in liberating the Vlasic plateau, Gen. 
Delic, the chief of the general staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
army, has told VECERNJI LIST. This statement by Delic and some 
other of his statements make it clear that an all-out war is 
being prepared and that signatures on truce agreements do not 
have any meaning any more, since the general openly admits that 
his army has made biggest advances during the truce period. The 
justification for this lies, of course, in Serb attacks in some 
other areas. 
  While not disputing the right of the Muslims to regain with 
weapons what the Serbs had taken from them in the same way we 
still cannot be indifferent to the escalation of the war, since 
we are all living in the same state and the war cannot leave us 
unaffected. 
  The Croats of Herceg-Bosna were the first to take up arms 
and 
show everyone that they were ready to defend their own 
territory, but never in this war have they launched conquest 
operations. It is clear now more than ever before that opting to 
defend was the correct decision. We can see now that it was much 
easier to defend one's home than have to fight to regain 
territory given up without fighting. 
  The chamber of deputies of the Croat republic of 
Herceg-Bosna 
at its latest session called on the belligerent parties in 
western Bosnia to sit at the negotiating table and put an end to 
senseless killing. Croats of Herceg-Bosna are for a just peace 
with the aggressor's, Serb side. The Serbs must--if not in any 
other way then under pressure from the great powers--accept the 
peace solution under which they keep as much as 49 percent of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina territory--more than belongs to them. The 
Muslims must also relax their position and give something for 
peace. It is obvious that the great powers do not accept the 
lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
therefore they do not want the war to continue. It is indeed 
absurd to wage the war without the blessing of Clinton and the 
allies, except--of course--in obvious self-defense. 
  We have never been closer to peace, but also to an all-out 
war. Croats are for peace. Let us hope that Muslim and Serb 
politicians are also for peace, and generals should in any case 
not be in charge of politics. Generals [words indistinct]. This 
is why Delic and Mladic should before the show-down ask their 
soldiers whether they are still prepared to get killed.

  [Text] Sarajevo, June 24 (AFP) -- NATO airplanes have 
fired warning flares against Serb forces attacking UN troops in 
northern Bosnia, the first such action since a truce became 
effective June 10, a UN spokesman said Friday [24 June]. Dutch 
UN armoured vehicles were hit by Serb shells Thursday at the 
village of Teocak, east of Tuzla, while escorting a humanitarian 
aid convoy, United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman 
Major Rob Annink said. "Air presence was requested and aircraft 
dropped flares as a warning signal," he explained. There were 
no injuries. 
  The request went to the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, 
Lieutenant General Michael Rose, who asked one of the regular 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air patrols in the region to 
approach and fire the flares, said Annink. He did not request 
full-scale air intervention which would have required the 
agreement of General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of UN 
troops in all of former Yugoslavia, and UN special 
representative Yasushi Akashi. Both Serb and Moslem artillery 
have remained active despite the truce around Mount Ozren, in 
northern Bosnia, with UN observations posts among the targets, 
the major said. 
  In particular, he referred to an attack on a post in 
Moslem-held territory east of the mountain, which was hit by 
Serb artillery, and a Nordic Battalion attacked by light arm 
fire. There were no injuries or damage, he said. Fighting in 
the Bihac enclave in western Bosnia, between the mainly Moslem 
Bosnian Army and a breakaway Moslem group, has died down but 
Serb forces had fired 160 shells against the army in the region, 
he said. 
  There were fewer ceasefire violations in the Bosnian capital 
Sarajevo, most of them at the airport. A Serb policeman was 
killed by a Bosnian sniper and two Bosnian soldiers were wounded 
by Serb bullets in the town, he said. The Bosnian Serb agency 
SRNA quoted a local radio report saying the Bosnian Army had 
launched an artillery attack against the strategic Serb-held 
town of Doboj Friday. "Several shells" had fallen on the town 
which was under general alert, the agency said.

  [Text] We learned from the republic of Srpska army today 
that it has no information on any NATO aircraft action on 
Serbian positions or any part of the territory of our republic 
yesterday, today, or last night, as asserted by UN spokesman 
Major Rob Annink at a news conference in Sarajevo this morning. 
He said that the members of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] 
called for support by NATO aircraft, which fired warning 
missiles at the positions of the Serbian fighters and the 
Serbian territory. 
  At the same time, the Army has denied the statement by Rob 
Annink that Serb forces yesterday attacked a Danish humanitarian 
convoy near Teocak. Despite the fact that the convoy was not 
announced, it arrived on the Muslims territory without problems, 
it unloaded humanitarian aid, and went back, again without 
problems.

Serb, fired on a convoy of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) 
Thursday at a place called Teocak, east of the town Tuzla, 
northern Bosnia, a local Bosnian Serb military command set out 
Friday [24 June]. The statement came as reaction to UNPROFOR 
spokesman in Sarajevo Rob Annink's statement that the Serb 
forces used mortars to attack UNPROFOR vehicles escorting a 
humanitarian convoy, and which then invited NATO planes "air 
support". 
  The Serb military command statement said "members of the 
Bosnian Serb Army did not open fire" on the convoy -- which, as 
specified, was not previously announced -- but that "a mortar 
mine was fired on the UNPROFOR vehicle by the Moslem forces 
stationed in the occupied Serb village of Nikolic, not far from 
the Serb positions." 
  The local Serb command denied also that "NATO air force 
combat activity was registered" subsequently in the Teocak 
region. Immediately after the convoy attack, NATO air force 
began overflights of Serb Positions, but did not engage in 
combat activity, the statement said. U.N. Special Envoy Yasushi 
Akashi's spokesman, Michael Williams, who met in Pale (near 
Sarajevo) Friday the Bosnian Serb Republic (R.S.) President 
Radovan Karadzic, denied reports that NATO air force was engaged 
Thursday in combat missions on Serb territory in the Teocak area. 
  Explaining there had been an inaccuracy in the English 
translation, Williams said NATO planes overflew the said area, 
but fired no warning missiles. They only gave warning signs, he 
said. U.N. secretary-general's spokesman Joe Sills, as TANJUG 
New York correspondent set out, confirmed Friday news agency 
reports that the Bosnian Serb forces opened mortar and 
machine-gun fire Thursday near Teocak on a humanitarian convoy 
for which reason, as he said, NATO planes fired a number of 
warning missiles. 
  One mortar mine exploded some twenty meters from an armoured 
personnel carrier escorting the convoy, but there were no 
casualties, said Sills. He noted that this was not classical 
air support to UNPROFOR and that for this reason no approval was 
requested from Akashi for air strikes.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- The first generation 
of officers of the republic of Srpska army and the Serb army of 
Krajina in Croatia was promoted at a ceremony in the Center of 
Military Academies in Banja Luka today. The first officers who 
attended the academy were promoted to the rank of lieutenant 
colonel. The second generation of noncommissioned officers of 
the two armies were also promoted. 
  The ceremony was attended by Radovan Karadzic, supreme 
commander of the republic of Srpska army and president of the 
republic of Srpska, Colonel-General Ratko Mladic, chief of 
general staff of the republic of Srpska army, Major General 
Milan Celeketic, chief of general staff of the Serb army of 
Krajina, many other guests, and thousands of Banja Luka 
citizens, as well as the new officers' families and friends. 
  Addressing the newly promoted officers, Radovan Karadzic 
said 
that the humiliation of allowing the international community to 
draw its maps and offer them under the "take it or leave it" 
principle was unacceptable. "We want to end this war. Our aim 
so far has been to defend our own territory, but if our enemies 
and the international community are forcing us into a 
counteroffensive, we will not stop," Karadzic stressed. 
  Colonel General Ratko Mladic, Major General Milan Celeketic, 
and Major General Slavko Lisica, head of the center of military 
academies in Banja Luka, also spoke at the ceremony. The Center 
of Military Academies in Banja Luka was opened last year in the 
premises of the former Petar Drapsin Training Center for 
Armored-Motorized Units. Personnel from the republic of Srpska 
and the republic of Serb Krajina are trained there to become 
officers and noncommissioned officers.

  [Text] Banja Luka, 25 June (TANJUG) -- Republic of Srpska 
president Radovan Karadzic said in Banja Luka this evening that 
the Serb republic would refuse to sign a peace agreement for 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina unless the signature meant an 
automatic suspension of sanctions against the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia. "Despite our desire for peace and readiness to 
make a sacrifice, we will not allow the Western world to destroy 
our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro," Karadzic said. 
  Assessing the current policy by the great powers toward the 
republic of Srpska, he said that despite the horrific pressure 
the West's policy was more favorable than last year. According 
to Karadzic, the Western powers have finally realized that the 
fate of "the great former Yugoslavia" must be experienced by 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina which was always singled out as 
"little Yugoslavia." This means that a unitary Bosnia is out of 
the question. 
  Speaking about a possible exchange of territories with the 
Muslim-Croat side, Karadzic said that this was possible and that 
perhaps it was inevitable, but the people's assembly of the 
republic of Srpska and the whole nation if necessary would have 
the final say on this matter. According to Karadzic, 
representatives of the "contact group" for the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina were clearly told that the Serbian side did 
not have a great deal of faith in them, but that the Serbian 
opinion would depend on the final solutions they offered. If 
rumors coming from the contact group can be trusted, it offers 
to create a fragmented republic of Srpska with no firm border on 
the Sava, Drina, or Una Rivers or around Sarajevo, which is 
completely unacceptable. 
  "If the Muslims want to enlarge their territory around 
Sarajevo, they must make some concessions to us in eastern 
Bosnia, namely Gorazde, Srebrenica, and Zepa. It is completely 
clear to us at the moment that America is dictating conditions 
that we cannot accept, which automatically means the 
continuation of the war." 
  "America and Germany have openly sided with the Muslim-Croat 
side, while Russia is openly neutral. It is precisely this that 
is encouraging the Muslims, who are now launching fierce 
offensives on Mount Ozren and toward the Serb-held town of 
Doboj, while we are defending ourselves. If this continues, we 
will switch to an active defense and push them back from the 
current lines of separation," Karadzic said in conclusion. 
  In addition to Banja Luka businessmen, the talks were 
attended by Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the republic of 
Srpska, and Velibor Ostojic, chairman of the Serb Democratic 
Party of Serb Lands.

  [Text] [First announcer] General Rasim Delic, chief of 
staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, has been interviewed by 
Slovenia Radio and TV. Coming up are excerpts from this 
interview. 
  The first question asked by the Slovene Radio and TV 
reporter 
was: What is the current situation in the battlefields? You 
have recently toured the front lines. Delic replied: 
  [Second announcer] As a matter of fact, I am almost 
constantly touring the frontlines because that is the only way 
to be in command and in charge of your units. This is not 
merely a matter of visiting confrontation lines. This is rather 
a matter of gaining an insight into the situation and of 
carrying out the orders and decisions I issue on behalf of my 
general staff to the units under my command. We should say we 
expected that this signed cease-fire might hold in combination 
with those demands we had raised as a condition for our signing 
it -- that is, that the problem of Gorazde ought to be resolved, 
that the NATO ultimatum and UN Security Council resolutions are 
carried out and that the Serb aggressor's combat operations in 
other areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina should come to an end. 
  What we are finding on the ground, though, indicates that 
these fundamental demands have not been honored and this in 
itself means that no basic conditions have been created for this 
agreement to come into being. We were ready, we had prepared 
maps, we had specified locations for liaison officers' 
observation points. The Serb side, however, did not accept this. 
  [First announcer] He stated that this failure to comply with 
the cease-fire was yet another reason for the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army and the Croat Defence Council [HVO] to maintain their 
combat preparedness at an increased level. There was also a 
question about new weapons. Asked whether weapons were finding 
their way to Bosnia-Herzegovina and if so, how, General Delic 
said: 
  [Second announcer] Apart from what has been captured from 
the 
enemy, one should say that most of the weapons, including those 
shown on TV, have come out of Bosnia-Herzegovina's factories. 
These are the main sources of our weapon supplies, as the 
embargo is after all being implemented as regards the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army as opposed to the other countries of the 
former Yugoslavia. Peace would come sooner if there were no 
embargo despite the fact that many are saying that the opposite 
would take place. If there were a balance of weapons and if the 
Serb aggressor were to start suffering defeats, that would force 
him to change his policy or to replace the people who have 
bloodied their hands as he would want to have this problem 
solved. 
  [First announcer] One of the questions was how the joint 
headquarters of the army and the HVO is operating. General 
Delic said: 
  [Second announcer] It ought to be said that the joint 
headquarters has not been set up [5-second transmission break] 
cannot order. The essence and the aim of this joint 
headquarters is to speed up the resolving of the remaining 
issues and further issues in the relations between the army and 
the HVO and to seek solutions. In other words, this is a 
coordinating body which suggests solutions in these spheres. 
The intention behind the establishment of this headquarters and 
new bodies within the joint headquarters was to gradually create 
a joint, unified command body of the federation's future army. 
  [First presenter] The next question was: Do you believe that 
there will be no more clashes between the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Army and the HVO? 
  [Second announcer] It is logical to believe that they should 
not take place,as all political conditions have been created for 
sorting out things on the ground in the way they should be 
sorted out, to the satisfaction of both peoples. I personally 
think there is no reason for such a clash. Hence, our shared 
goal is to fight the Serbian aggressor. 
  [First announcer] The last question: Every war has its own 
logic, its roots, its beginning , its culmination and, of 
course, its end. Which stage has the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
reached? General Delic said: 
  [Second announcer] In terms of balance of powers, I 
personally think that the war has reached its peak. I believe 
that the Serbian aggressor has no longer the potential to 
reinforce its ranks. The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has the 
strength to embark on the liberating phase of armed struggle. 
This is, of course, a simplified view as it does not take 
account of international factors and their influence on the 
armed struggle in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This has hitherto been a 
very important element. In any case, in my opinion, the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army has finished the defensive phase of war 
and is now entering the phase of war for liberation. Anyway, 
preconditions have been created for pressing ahead. Obviously, 
this renders the Serbian aggressor impatient in a sense as this 
creates pressure for finding a solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as soon as possible -- hence, everything they have occupied by 
force and aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina may come under 
threat, Army General Rasim Delic, chief of staff of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, said at the end of the interview with 
Slovenia Radio and TV.

  [Excerpts] Sarajevo, June 27 (AFP) -- UN officials were 
seeking a meeting with Bosnian Serb and Moslem military leaders 
Monday following the killing of a British UN soldier by 
suspected Serb gunners and other attacks on peacekeepers in the 
eastern enclave of Gorazde. Commander Eric Chaperon, spokesman 
for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the unidentified 
soldier was killed Sunday evening at his observation post in 
Gorazde, probably by Serb gunners. His death brought to 44 the 
number of peacekeepers killed in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the past 
two years. "Sunday was a really bad day for the UN in Gorazde," 
Chaperon said. He said UN patrols in the region had come under 
repeated attack by Serb and Moslem gunners throughout the 
weekend, but no further casualties were reported. [passage 
omitted] 
  Elsewhere, artillery duels continued Monday in the northern 
Mount Ozren region, where the Moslem-led Bosnian army has been 
waging a major offensive against Serb forces, but the fighting 
was less intense than over the weekend, Chaperon said. "It is 
clear that the Bosnian troops have made territorial gains," he 
said although he couldn't provide any more details. 
  The Serbs have reportedly evacuated several villages in the 
area in the face of the Moslem offensive. 
  Chaperon said UN military observers deployed in the north 
were reporting heavy shelling from both sides. The observers 
were finding it increasingly difficult to accomplish their 
mission as they are not being granted access to the battle 
zones, he said. The fighting is in a strategic zone just south 
of a thin land corridor linking Serb-conquered territory in 
northeast and western Bosnia. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, June 26 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem-Croat 
federation in Bosnia has not yet appointed a joint army command, 
but only a joint staff which has no command authority, 
Moslem-controlled Radio Sarajevo quotes Moslem Army Commander 
Rasim Delic as saying on Sunday [26 June]. The joint staff is 
to speed up the solving of the remaining problems in relations 
between the Moslem and Bosnian Croat armies, he added. The 
setting up of a joint command is envisaged under the Vienna 
accords which put the finishing touches to the Washington 
agreement signed by Bosnia's Moslems and Croats in March under 
strong U.S. pressure. 
  Two days ago, Bosnian Croat Army representatives turned down 
an offer of separation along the lines of contact with Moslem 
formations in the upper flow of the Vrbas in central Bosnia, on 
the grounds that it was much too early for such a move to be 
made. The lack of trust between the local commanders is not 
surprising in view of the fact that the memory is still green of 
bitter battles fought by the two sides in central Bosnia for a 
year, until they were curbed by the Washington agreement.

  [Text] Jadranko Prlic is the new deputy premier of the 
Federation, and therefore vice president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina government, and defense minister. Here is 
what he told our correspondent Ivica Tomica about the tasks 
facing the man with three important functions in the Federation 
and the government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna, in an 
exclusive interview for Croatian Herzeg-Bosna radio. 
  [Begin recording] [Tomica] Asked whether the newly appointed 
deputy premier of the Federation and defense minister will keep 
his post as prime minister of the Croat republic of 
Herzeg-Bosna, Prlic said: 
  [Prlic] There are in fact three positions here. In line with 
the constitution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, the 
government has a premier and a deputy premier, so that, speaking 
about the Federation's government, I am deputy premier, and, 
speaking about the government of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am deputy prime minister [podpredsjednik 
vlade], and I am consequently defense minister in both cases. 
  The government of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and 
Herzeg-Bosna itself will continue functioning in the interim 
period. There will be many problematic relations and decisions, 
but one thing must be understood: Life goes on both through 
inertia and through things which have already been initiated. 
  I would like to say something -- I will say this next week 
in 
Sarajevo: the Croats have entered the Federation of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina with a considerable dowry. They had a 
regulated legal system, a regulated system of payment of 
soldiers, police force, state administration, health service, 
education system, judiciary, and care for the families of the 
dead and wounded members of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO]. 
I am speaking about all these things which have not at all been 
regulated on the territories which have until now been under the 
control of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. There is a great 
imbalance in that respect. We will -- I will personally -- 
demand very high standards for the organization of the state 
administration and the full implementation of the Federation's 
constitution. This is the basis on which I, in my capacity as 
deputy premier, will not back down. Consequently, I believe 
that all other members of the Government of Croatian nationality 
will do the same. I believe that other government members will 
support this stance as well. 
  [Tomica] What will you do as the new defense minister? 
  [Prlic] At this moment, as defense minister of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, I am nominally the defense minister of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. This situation should be solved 
because the HVO has its own Defense Ministry and its own system 
of logistics, and everything else a military force needs. I 
will try to attain gentleman's agreements in that respect, which 
will clearly specify all issues. I believe that I should be the 
defense minister of a joint command. All the many variations 
were set up when the Federation's constitution was signed and 
relevant military agreements which followed the signing. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Belgrade, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Moslems refused to 
meet Bosnian Serb army representatives for U.N.-sponsored talks 
at Sarajevo airport on Saturday [25 June]. U.N. spokesman Rob 
Annink said the United Nations would try to organise another 
meeting between the Bosnian belligerents on Sunday to negotiate 
an extension to the four-month truce, REUTERS said. U.N. 
observers blamed Moslem snipers for the death of a Serb woman 
and a Serb soldier in Sarajevo on Friday. Annink told reporters 
that Moslem snipers were responsible for a number of ceasefire 
provocations and violations on Friday. 
  Moslem forces have been disregarding the one-month 
ceasefire, 
which was signed in Geneva on June 8 and took effect on June 10, 
and have continued to attack Bosnian Serb territories. On 
Thursday, Moslem forces commander Rasim Delic urged the new 
allies -- Bosnian Croats -- to mount an all-out war against the 
Serbs. Moslems and Croats, who had fought bitterly for 
territories since early 1993, succumbed to strong U.S. pressure 
in Washington on March 18 and agreed to form a federation in 
Bosnia, which should eventually form a confederation with 
neighbouring Croatia.

  [Text] A British soldier has been shot dead in Bosnia, the 
Ministry of Defence [MoD] said today. Private Sean Richard 
Taylor, 20, of Cleveland, was a member of the Duke of 
Wellington's Regiment. He was killed last night at an 
observation point at Gorazde, a Muslim enclave in the east of 
the country which is surrounded by Bosnian Serb forces. He was 
the sixth British soldier to die in Bosnia. The shooting came a 
few days after two British soldiers were injured when an 
explosion damaged their armoured vehicle six miles south-west of 
Maglaj in central Bosnia. The MoD said Pte. Taylor was manning 
an observation post which came under attack. He died from a 
single bullet.

  [Text] Kragujevac, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- Aleksa Buha, foreign 
minister of the republic of Srpska, told Kragujevac radio today 
that "a conceptual muddle" regarding the resolution of the 
crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina continues. To the correspondent's 
remark that the formula is "take it or leave it" and that the 
lifting of the arms embargo and a continued implementation of 
the sanctions are proposed if the Serbian side does not accept 
the formula, Buha said that the international community has been 
warned hundreds of times that the conflict could then assume 
unforseeable proportions, as Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev has warned. 
  "I do not believe that the international community will 
allow 
things to get out of hand and take that course if the plan is 
not accepted. It is more likely that pressure will be put on 
all sides to reach a compromise, and perhaps a solution will be 
found within the new proposal, but with certain corrections. I 
believe the whole matter is in U.S. hands," Buha said. He said 
everything will become clearer in the next fortnight, after a 
series of talks. 
  "The solution lies in the recognition of the three peoples' 
right to self-determination, that is, to having their states and 
territorial borders, and after that all sovereign nations would 
establish the sort of relations that suit them," Buha said.

  Petrovac, June 26 (TANJUG) -- Fierce inter-Muslim clashes 
in the Cazin Krajina, north-western part of the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, are in their fifteenth day. 
Radio Velkaton, based in Velika Kladusa, the centre of the 
Muslim autonomous province of West Bosnia (APZB), reported on 
Sunday that troops loyal to fundamentalist leader Alija 
Izetbegovic were not chosing means in an effort to enter the 
territory held by APZB forces. According to the same source, 
there are dead, wounded and captured on both sides. 
  Radio Bihac, held by Izetbegovic's supporters, said that 
forces loyal to APZB President Fikret Abdic unsuccessfully 
attempted a number of infantry breakthroughs on the night of 
June 25-26 and Sunday morning. The APZB was proclaimed in 1993 
on the basis of the outcome of a referendum held in the Cazin 
Krajina, which is predominantlx populated by Muslims. Shortly 
after, President Abdic, a successful local businessman, signed 
peace accords with the Bosnian Serbs and Croats. 
  There followed an outbreak of fighting between APZB troops 
and troops loyal to Izetbegovic. Several hundred people have 
been killed in the inter-Muslim fighting.

  [Excerpt] Doboj, 26 Jun (TANJUG) -- Muslim forces have 
resumed their intensive attacks on Serbian positions and 
residential areas along all fronts in the Doboj area, the 
information service of the republic of Srpska army's 1st Krajina 
Corps said this evening. The fiercest Muslim attacks are taking 
place on the Ozren-Vozuca front. In addition to several 
unsuccessful attempts to break through Serb defense lines in the 
southwestern part of the Ozren battlefield, the Muslim units 
have also launched fierce attacks on the Serbian villages of 
Stanic Rijeka and Karanovac on the right bank of the river 
Spreca and on Alica Naselje and Badinovici in the eastern part 
of Ozren. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belgrade, June 26 (TANJUG) -- Moslems have been 
attacking Serb positions south of Doboj (northern Bosnia) for 
weeks, violating the June 10 truce, a U.N. spokesman said in 
Sarajevo on Sunday [26 June]. Major Rob Annink, spokesman for 
the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), is quoted by REUTERS as 
saying that the `(Moslem) army seems to have gained some 
territory around Zavidovici, about three to four kilometres 
worth.' Annink said that the Moslems had captured some 
territory also around Ribnica, Serb town near Tuzla in the 
north, on the road to Sarajevo. 
  U.N. observers registered 1,700 explosions between Ribnica 
and Doboj, a stretch of 45 kilometres, on Saturday. Observers 
believe that the fighting is a prelude to a full-scale battle 
for control of the northern corridor through the Posavina (Sava 
river valley) region which links the east and west of the 
Bosnian Serb republic. Flouting the one-month Bosnia-wide 
truce, Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic on Thursday urged that 
the Moslems and their new allies -- the Croats -- join forces 
and mount an all-out war against the Serbs.

  [Text] One civilian was killed and three injured in last 
night's Serb artillery attack on Usora [Croatian enclave in 
northern Bosnia]. Doctors in Tesanj war hospital are fighting 
to save the lives of the wounded. There is fresh damage to 
residential buildings. Serbs are heavily shelling locations 
adjacent to the front line. From their strongholds in Putnikovo 
Brdo, Zeravica, and Stanovi, Serbs were shelling defense lines 
and the free Usora territory with mortars, tanks, and long-range 
shells until late last night. They also attempted an infantry 
breakthrough but Usora defenders prevented it. Fresh explosions 
were heard in the free Usora territory again this morning.

  [Text] Zvornik, June 25 (TANJUG) -- The Moslem forces 
continued firing on positions of the Bosnian Serb army in the 
past 24 hours in the northern, western, central and other parts 
of the Bosnian Serb republic. This is a flagrant violation of 
the agreement reached in Geneva by the two warring sides to 
refrain from military activity and which entered into force on 
June 10. The Moslem forces strongly attacked with all kinds of 
weapons including heavy artillery the area of Srbobran (former 
Donji Vakuf) and Mt Vlasic in central Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG 
learns from Serb military sources. 
  A number of attacks were also registered in the area of 
Teslic, Doboj, Ozren, Gradacac, Orasje and Trebava, in 
northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moslem armed action was also 
registered in other northeastern parts of Bosnia -- in the 
Olovo-Kladanj direction, in the area of Mt Majevica and in the 
Zvornik area. Moslems launched artillery and mortar attacks on 
the town of Teslic without inflicting any casualties but causing 
considerable material damages on civilian facilities. 
  Joint forces of the Croat Defense Council (HVO) and the 
regular Croatian troops use anti-aircraft guns in their attacks 
on the Orasje front. The Moslems tried to inflitrate a 
sabotage-terrorist group in the Orasje part of the front 
Saturday morning but the group was routed, the press center of 
the First Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb army reports. 
  Moslem action did not stop along the Bihac-Krupa 
confrontation line in western Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serb military 
sources state. Moslems also continued attacks on Serb territory 
from the direction of Gorazde, Moslem enclave in eastern Bosnia 
which has been declared a safe area by the United Nations.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 24 (TANJUG) -- Some 400 Iranian 
terrorists have arrived in the former Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past month alone, writes the 
Belgrade magazine INTERVJU. This evidently shows that the 
Islamic world is ready to openly support Bosnian Muslim leader 
Alija Izetbegovic, it says. The terrorists are sent to Bosnian 
(by way of the Croatian capital Zagreb and the port of Split) to 
illegally arm the Muslim troops loyal to Izetbegovic and train 
them for terrorist actions, the paper writes. 
  As admitted by Izetbegovic's rival Fikret Abdic, the first 
group of about 2,000 mercenaries and terrorists from Islamic 
countries arrived two years ago and were deployed mostly in the 
area of Zenica and throughout central Bosnia. Abdic is the 
leader of Muslims in western Bosnia who do not recognize the 
fundamentalist Muslim authorities in Sarajevo. 
  The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and 
Izetbegovic's ambassador to the U.N. Muhamed Sacirbej claimed at 
the time that the group included not more than 'several hundred' 
mujaheddin. 
  The Turkish daily MILLIYET last year for the first time 
mentioned about 1,300 fighters from Iran, Libya, Tunisia, 
Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia and 
Syria in Bosnia. 
  Alongside with the illegal arrival of mercenaries, UNPROFOR 
has been including in its force an increasing number of troops 
from Islamic countries. About 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani 
and 1,200 Bangladeshi troops are expected to join U.N. 
peacekeepers in Bosnia next summer and autumn. 
  Last summer, Washington advised all U.S. nationals not to 
travel to former Yugoslavia because they could become the target 
of Islamic extremists from the ranks of the Iranian hezbollah, 
INTERVJU writes. It also cites the opinion of an expert for 
terrorism in the U.S. Congress, Joseph Bodenski, who has 
described the Balkans as Iran's springboard for Europe. The 
paper also cites a part of Bodenski's report to the Congress 
which said that more than 50 hezbollah experts had been sent 
from Balbec to Bosnia in November 1992 to train local troops and 
carry out terrorist operations. 
  The objective was to deploy in Bosnia a brigade of 2,000 
Iranian commandos and prepare the situation for a military 
conquest in the Balkans, and later in Europe. Miroljub Jevtic, 
an expert in Islam at the Belgrade faculty of political science 
told INTERVJU that `The arrival of hezbollah to Bosnia and the 
radicalization of Izetbegovic's army is yet another indicator of 
the defeat of the U.S. and Western European policy in former 
Yugoslavia.' Jevtic says that Izetbegovic has tricked the U.S. 
and Europe into believing that the Bosnian Muslims, like the 
Europeans, would not accept Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism 
as a form of political struggle for an Islamic state in Europe, 
and later, under pressure to accept peace, threatened the West 
with a new war. 
  After Geneva peace talks two weeks ago, Izetbegovic made 
threats to the West saying that he was prepared to use a secret 
weapon against it, i.e. to raise the entire Islamic world, if 
his territorial demands were rejected. Radical international 
organizations `Muslim Brothers' and `Salah Jedid' have also been 
cooperating with the Sarajevo government. 
  Under the earlier communist Yugoslav regime, the 
organizations provided schooling for their members in several 
Yugoslav towns and had headquarters in Sarajevo.

  [Text] Kragujevac, Yugoslavia, June 26 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav 
Vice-Premier Zeljko Simic on Sunday hoped that normalization of 
relations between Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) and Croatia 
would shortly be resumed. 
  Simic based his optimism on "the political reality that 
relations between Belgrade and Zagreb will have the decisive 
influence on the outcome of the crisis which is rocking the 
lands of former Yugoslavia and the Balkans as a whole." He was 
speaking for the local radio in Kragujevac, central Serbia. 
  "Therefore, I am not inclined to speak of a halt in the 
normalization process, but rather of a lull which I expect will 
be followed by progress in political dialogue which will reflect 
positively on the Bosnian civil war," said Simic, who chairs the 
Yugoslav Commission on Normalization of Relations between 
Yugoslavia and Croatia. 
  Yugoslavia is ready to make the utmost contribution to 
improving bilateral relations in accordance with the 1993 Geneva 
Declaration, he added. 
  Speaking about the breakdown in talks on normalizing 
economic 
relations between the republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and 
Croatia, Simic said this was giving rise to apprehensions, 
especially in view of extremely immoderate and war-mongering 
statements by Croatian officials. 
  The R.S.K. was proclaimed in late 1991 by the local Serbs in 
their ancestral lands within the arbitrary Communist-era borders 
of Croatia in response to Croatia's violent secession form 
former Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights. 
  The R.S.K. was placed under U.N. protection in early 1992, 
which has, however, failed to deter Croatia from launching four 
offensives on the territory, killing a thousand Serbs, mostly 
civilians, in the process. 
  Simic said that a comprehensive settlement for the problems 
between the R.S.K. and Croatia was possible only with full 
respect for the political reality. The implementation of such a 
settlement must be phased -- unconditional peace should be 
established first, followed by the resumption of communications 
and economic and other ties, with political normalisation coming 
last, he explained. 
  He dismissed as unfounded the insistence of Croatian 
officials that the key to the R.S.K.-Croatia problem lies in 
Belgrade, and explained that Yugoslavia had been taking pains to 
strengthen equality-based dialogue between the R.S.K. and 
Croatia. 
  Simic denied allegations that he was to blame for the delay 
in a meeting of Yugoslav and Croatian intellectuals in Belgrade. 
Yugoslavia is a free, democratic country which guarantees full 
safety and freedom of speech to all visitors, he stressed.

  [Text] Belgrade, 25 June (TANJUG) -- Slobodan Milosevic, 
president of the Republic of Serbia, received Thorvald 
Stoltenberg and David Owen, cochairmen of the Geneva conference, 
who arrived in our country today. 
  The office of the president of the Republic of Serbia issued 
a statement saying that the most important issues involved in 
reaching a successful solution to the crisis in the territory of 
the former Yugoslavia were discussed during the lengthy and 
frank talks. 
  President Milosevic said he expected the international 
community to overcome its one-sided approach in solving the 
Yugoslav crisis, and that in the future it will grant equal 
consideration to Serbian interests in its proposals for a peace 
plan. In that respect, the Serbian president said that the 
principles defined during the negotiations so far can be a good 
basis for a final solution to the crisis. He noted that the 
one-month cease-fire in Bosnia was undoubtedly not long enough 
for holding negotiations on the former Bosnia-Herzegovina with a 
positive outcome. Serbia therefore advocates the extension of 
the cease-fire between the warring sides and more intense 
negotiations in order to reach a final political solution to the 
crisis. 
  In President Milosevic's view, sincere efforts to restore a 
lasting and stable peace imply a solution which should contain 
no unsolved, postponed, and open issues, and consequently it 
should not contain grey areas or any other undefined and partial 
solutions that could be potential new flashpoints. We should 
use this occasion to find an overall solution that will make 
possible a stable and lasting peace, the lifting of the economic 
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the 
normalization of life in this region, President Milosevic 
stressed in today's talks with Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen 
of the conference on Yugoslavia. This is how the statement from 
the office of the president of the Republic of Serbia ends.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Serbian </F>
Radical Party, by Zeljko Garmaz; place and date not given: "I 
Support Tudjman and Kucan Because They Will Never Agree To 
Restore Yugoslavia!"] 
  [Text] A recent statement by [Serbian Radical Party leader] 
Vojislav Seselj, that Croats who remained in Serbia should be 
driven out, caused a furor even in notoriously Greater Serbian 
newspapers such as VECERNJE NOVOSTI, which severely criticized 
Seselj's threat. However, it is obvious that the commentary in 
VECERNJE NOVOSTI does not indicate an about-turn in Serbian 
policy toward the protection of minorities. Simply, Milosevic's 
regime wants to destroy its former ally politically; anyway, 
Vojislav Seselj will soon be on trial for the incident in the 
Serbian Assembly. 
  Asked why he did not attack President of the Parliament 
Radovan Bozovic physically as well, Seselj replied that "Tarzan 
never hit Cheetah!" Then we asked Seselj why he did not use his 
gun, with which he never parts. 
  [Seselj] I only draw my gun when I am attacked by five or 
more men. When there are fewer than five, I defend myself 
without a gun. I have been in dangerous situations many times 
before and did not use my gun. When I was attacked by three 
psychopaths at the restaurant "Russian Czar," and one of them 
hit me over the back with a chair and my head started bleeding, 
I did not draw my gun, for I was able to defend myself without a 
weapon even then. But it is true that the gun makes me feel 
safer and enables me to walk the streets of Belgrade on my own, 
without bodyguards. 
  [Garmaz] You have recently threatened the Croats living in 
Serbia with having to move to Croatia. The Croats and the 
Hungarians who remained in Serbia are being terrorized more 
often, as after every such statement of yours. A church has 
recently been blown up in Subotica [town in Vojvodina on 
Hungarian border]. 
  [Seselj] It was no threat. I am calling for a civilized 
exchange of population. The Croats and Tudjman's regime started 
this exchange in an uncivilized manner. The Serbs have already 
been expelled from Croatia, and we want those Serbs to exchange 
their property, apartments, and houses in Croatia with Croats 
living in the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] as soon as 
possible. The process was going well through the mediation of 
the Catholic Church. I think that the Croats have always had 
the better deal in such exchanges, because they were better off 
when leaving.... The Serbs had to flee the country, but the 
Croats had the chance to think it over and be informed, through 
the Catholic Church, about the property they would come to. 
  [Garmaz] You call the exchange caused by threats a civilized 
and democratic process? 
  [Seselj] This proposal is not undemocratic and uncivilized 
at all. Anyway, it is based on history. You must know that 
Franjo Tudjman and Dobrica Cosic agreed on this some time ago! 
  [Garmaz] What did they agree on? 
  [Seselj] On the civilized exchange of populations between 
the FRY and the Republic of Croatia. At least that is what 
Cosic said in Belgrade. The Serbian press wrote about it and 
Cosic's statement was broadcast on television. 
  [Garmaz] When did Dobrica Cosic say that he and Tudjman had 
agreed on the exchange of population? 
  [Seselj] Right after the negotiations at which Prevlaka was 
the most important item on the agenda. I cannot recall the 
exact date, but that agreement is a well known fact in Serbia. 
  [Garmaz] In your opinion, how many Croats are there in the 
FRY? 
  [Seselj] We estimate that there could still be about 30,000 
Croats. 
  [Garmaz] And how many Serbs in Croatia? 
  [Seselj] Many more. About 300,000 Serbs were expelled from 
Croatia, excluding the Serbs from the "Serbian Krajina." For, 
when I say Croatia, I mean Croatia without the territory of the 
"Serbian Krajina"! Quite a few have fled to Western Europe. 
They are not registered as refugees.... 
  [Garmaz] How important are you for the political life of 
Serbia, anyway? Why should anyone take your statements 
seriously? Do you have the power to implement this "civilized" 
exchange of population? 
  [Seselj] The number of votes that a person received at the 
elections, i.e. the number of deputies in parliament, is the 
basic and formal way of assessing political power. At the last 
elections, 600,000 Serbian citizens voted for us. Therefore, 
that is the political force that we can safely count on. 
However, we got those votes under most adverse political 
circumstances, under a total media blockade, and in spite of a 
dreadful campaign by the ruling Milosevic regime against my 
party, which adds another element to the strength of our ratings 
and this should not be underestimated! Political rating is a 
changing category, so I would not like to talk about what I 
expect will happen in the future. My predictions may seem 
unrealistic to you, but they have come true many times before. 
  [Garmaz] How much did you lose as a result of the latest 
incident in parliament? 
  [Seselj] Those events have only boosted our ratings, as the 
Socialists realized as well, since they showed the event in 
parliament only once on television and no more. This has 
improved our reputation with the people even more: the tearing 
out of the microphone wiring, the struggle with the police, and 
throwing water at the deputies of the Chamber of Citizens.... 
Anyway, every network in the world reported on it, if only as a 
curiosity, and this enabled us to break the media blockade, 
which had lasted for a full eight months. 
  [Garmaz] The event in parliament shows you finally resorting 
to violence to realize your goals. 
  [Seselj] Nothing was forced there.... Milosevic's team say 
that was an act of vandalism, which is impossible, as there was 
no material damage. Throwing a glass of water at someone is not 
life- threatening and is not particularly violent. Only those 
who got wet could take offense. Since the water was not very 
cold -- meteorological conditions could not have made the water 
a health hazard -- the act could have also been interpreted as a 
welcome refreshment, as everybody sitting in parliament felt as 
though they were in a sauna! 
  As far as the struggle with the police is concerned, they 
simply attacked our deputies. It was not we who attacked the 
police, it was they who attacked us. They were ordered to 
escort only one deputy out. The police cannot violate our 
rights as deputies to sit in the seats assigned to us in 
parliament by carrying out only one order. The cannot tread on 
us just to carry some other deputy out of the parliament 
building. 
  [Garmaz] No political event over the past couple of years 
that has caused excitement in the Serb media has happened 
without you. How do you explain this? 
  [Seselj] I have a specific and a very efficient way of 
getting publicity, especially when I am being threatened and put 
under a media blockade. 
  [Garmaz] You do not think that threatening the courts, from 
the World Court in The Hague to this trial in Belgrade, is a 
serious matter and you are always happy to appear. Is that also 
part of your struggle for publicity? 
  [Seselj] It was not always like that. When I was tried in 
Osijek, I did not show up, nor at the trial in Dubrovnik. But 
in Belgrade, I cannot wait to appear. It all depends on the 
objective political interests of the particular period. It might 
have been politically beneficial if I had gone to the trials in 
Osijek or Dubrovnik. However, there was a serious chance of my 
being liquidated before I entered the courtroom. Consequently, 
objective political interest was outweighed by other factors. 
  [Garmaz] So you have decided to use the trial over the 
events in parliament to put the authorities on trial!? 
  [Seselj] Yes, I am going to use this trial to put Slobodan 
Milosevic and [his wife] Mira Markovic on trial.... 
  [Garmaz] Why Mira Markovic? 
  [Seselj] Mira Markovic has all the power in Serbia. 
Slobodan Milosevic has proved to be a henpecked husband, with 
his wife ordering him around and making all the decisions.... 
She is just like Elena Ceausescu! That is the main reason! 
Also, she is the leading ideologist of the League of 
Communists-Movement for Yugoslavia, a very dangerous political 
party, which is actually a terrorist organization that has 
already committed heinous crimes in these parts. 
  [Garmaz] But the League of Communists-Movement for 
Yugoslavia is not in power. 
  [Seselj] It is not in power but they are very influential, 
for they are fronted by the wife of the president of the 
country! The party organized the well-known kidnapping of 
Sandzak Muslims from the train. 
  [Garmaz] Can you prove that? 
  [Seselj] Of course I can. It was organized in Belgrade and 
many people were involved, including some 10 military trucks, 
which were parked in front of the train. You see, something 
like that, which happened a year and a half ago, in view of the 
involvement of so many people and so much equipment, cannot 
remain a secret. They carefully planned the crime so as to blame 
it on Radovan Karadzic at a suitable moment, at which they did 
not succeed! 
  Furthermore, we announced yesterday that the League of 
Communists -Movement for Yugoslavia participated in arming the 
Muslims in certain parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.... 
  [Garmaz] Why would the League of Communists-Movement for 
Yugoslavia be arming the Muslims? 
  [Seselj] To win them over. They are still planning to 
restore Yugoslavia. Slobodan Milosevic fell for this, and we 
are now his bitter adversaries. While he was a patriot, he 
could count on our support, but now that he has changed 
completely so as to try to reach an agreement with the United 
States, we will depose him. Anyway, the process of reintegrating 
Yugoslavia is proceeding very well on the territory of all 
former federal units of the former SFRY [Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia]. This process is also there in 
Slovenia, where they are trying to overthrow Kucan. The United 
States wants to establish a new regime there, which will agree 
to be reintegrated into Yugoslavia. The process is increasingly 
evident in Croatia as well, and Tudjman's position is very weak. 
He will probably be overthrown soon. Now I am keeping my 
fingers crossed for Tudjman, for he will probably never agree to 
a new Yugoslavia! 
  [Garmaz] You support Tudjman? 
  [Seselj] Franjo Tudjman will never agree to return to 
Yugoslavia! Of this I am absolutely convinced! 
  [Garmaz] Do you think that any Croatian politician would 
agree to restoring Yugoslavia? 
  [Seselj] Those who oppose Tudjman would -- Mesic and Manolic 
-- and also people like Racan and Ante Markovic, and this would 
be a most dangerous solution. A new Yugoslavia could never 
function as a normal country, for it would be constantly 
weakened by internal political conflicts. Everything that we 
have endured over the past couple of years would be repeated in 
a decade or two. 
  Furthermore, there is a similar process in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina 
as well, and Izetbegovic will soon be overthrown. Milosevic is 
preparing to replace Radovan Karadzic, while Mate Boban has 
already been eliminated. After that follows the restoration of 
Croatia's integrity, but it will never be able to function. 
Croatia can function only if the "Krajina" is not an integral 
part of it. With Krajina as an integral part of Croatia, 
especially with a high degree of autonomy, Croatia will never be 
a serious country. 
  Bosnia-Herzegovina will never be a serious country, if it is 
composed of three federal units or two federal units. If, 
applying the same principle, Vojvodina, Kosovo, and Sandzak are 
given autonomy, Serbia will not be able to function as a serious 
country either! Nor could a new Yugoslavia with such complex 
domestic relations be a serious country. 
  [Garmaz] You have recently stated that "the Croats will 
create a fourth Yugoslavia!?" 
  [Seselj] That is not exactly what I said. The fourth 
Yugoslavia will first of all be created by the West, with the 
help of those Balkan politicians who accept that option. 
Milosevic has already accepted a new Yugoslavia, for he is 
counting on the United States to accept him as the head of the 
new Yugoslavia. That is where he is very much mistaken. The 
United States will use him in the process of creating new 
Yugoslavia, and then they will get rid of him. They were the 
ones who called Milosevic "the Balkan butcher," "a war 
criminal...." 
  [Garmaz] Do you seriously believe in a new Yugoslavia? 
  [Seselj] I cannot understand that you do not see it already 
happening in Croatia. 
  [Garmaz] Nobody in Croatia wants Yugoslavia! 
  [Seselj] Do not be so naive.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Serbian opposition 
leader Vojislav Kostunica on Saturday criticised the Western 
attitude to the Yugoslav crisis, denouncing U.N. sanctions 
against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) as unjust and senseless. 
  The sanctions "are inflicting suffering on the people and 
not 
the regime," they are destroying the market economy and 
compromising the democratic idea in a society where "there has 
been no democracy for half a century," said Kostunica, the 
leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, in an opening address 
at the party's convention. 
  The draconic U.N. sanctions, clamped on Yugoslavia in May 
1992, have brought the population and 500,000 refugees to the 
verge of destitution, depriving them of the most basic 
foodstuffs and medicaments as well as of fuel for heating homes, 
schools, hospitals and refugee camps. The attitude of the 
Democratic Party of Serbia to the world's power-wielders is 
"neither pro-Western, nor anti-Western," said its leader. 
  Party Vice-President Vladeta Jankovic said that the party 
was 
giving "unreserved support" to Serbs outside Serbia in their 
just struggle for securing space for independent life, and added 
that the party considered as justified the aspiration that the 
Serbs' ethnic space should be united in one state. 
  He said there was no danger of the party getting bogged down 
in primitive ultra-nationalism, because it had never viewed with 
understanding the inflicting of suffering on civilians, 
unnecessary destruction of towns and cities and demolition of 
religious and cultural landmarks. The party will work for 
bringing to justice the handful of war criminals who have donned 
the uniform of the Serb soldier, he said.

  [Text] At about 0500 this morning, a Serbian Army convoy 
made up of 28 tanks and seven transportation trucks, as well as 
other military equipment, moved from Prishtina in the direction 
of Podujeve on the Miloshev-Leban road. A characteristic of the 
Serb Army movements this time is that many Serb flags were seen 
placed above the tanks. 
  It is worthy of mention that in this region today, there 
were 
frequent flights by Serbian aircraft, and many military vehicles 
were observed on the streets of Prishtina, reports the Kosova 
Information Center.

  [Text] Skopje, 25 Jun (TANJUG) -- Stevo Crvenkovski, 
foreign minister of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
[FYROM], today sent a letter to the United Nations in which he 
says that "the Yugoslav Army has been continuously threatening 
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FYROM for three 
months now." 
  "We have tried using all peaceful means to reduce tension on 
the border with the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]. 
However, the latest incident on the strategically important 
point 1703, Straza, where Yugoslav soldiers have taken position 
-- which indicates that they intend to stay on our territory for 
some time -- calls for the use of all available means to force 
the Yugoslav Army to withdraw to its own territory," the FYROM 
foreign minister says in his letter to Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Crvenkovski also says that the FYROM, "if these incidents 
continue, will demand that the United Nations take the most 
energetic measures to protect our territorial integrity."

  [Text] Skopje, 25 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Alliance 
of Serbs in Macedonia [DSSM] today sent a public message to the 
citizens of Serb nationality instructing them to provide 
information for the P1 [population census] form only if the form 
is printed in two languages--Serbian and Macedonian--and to 
refuse to take part in the census if the form is printed only in 
Macedonian. 
  A statement released by the DSSM says that this message was 
sent to the Serbs in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] because some census collectors are trying to 
register the Serbs on forms printed in Macedonian, with the 
assistance of an official interpreter, which is in contravention 
of the Law on the Census applied to citizens belonging to 
national communities.

<F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>
  [Text] Skopje, June 26 (TANJUG) -- A Serb party in the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) said on 
Sunday that F.Y.R.O.M. census takers were registering Serb 
families in pencil and refusing to register those Serbs to whom 
the authorities had either denied or not gotten round to 
granting citizenship. 
  The early census in the F.Y.R.O.M. began on June 21 and is 
due to be completed by July 5, at a cost of 1.7 million dollars, 
financed and monitored by the European Union and the Council of 
Europe. 
  The Democratic Party of Serbs in Macedonia said in a 
statement the Serbs had been justified to warn European experts 
of possible fraud in connection with the Serbs' citizenship 
designed to minimise their numbers. 
  According to the previous census, taken in 1991, the 
F.Y.R.O.M. had a population of 1.3 million, 2.3 per cent or 
50,000 of whom were Serbs. The Serbs, however, immediately 
challenged the results. The Association of Serbs and 
Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. insists that the country has a 
quarter of a million strong Serb community, 50,000 of whom in 
the northern Kumanovo commune alone. 
  The Democratic Party of Serbs claims that various forms of 
pressure are being brought to bear on the Serbs during the 
current census, and that even the party's activists in the field 
are being threatened with 60 days in prison for drawing 
attention to the fraudulent activities of authorities and 
census-takers. 
  As a special form of pressure, incidents on the border with 
Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) are being fabricated and then 
taken as a pretext for waging a massive anti-Serb media campaign.

  [Text] Skopje, June 24 (TANJUG) -- The Democratic Party of 
Turks (DPTM) is taking advantage of the early census in the 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (F.Y.R.O.M.) to pressure 
Moslem Macedonians into declaring themselves as Turks, the 
Association of Macedonians of Islam Religion warned on Friday. 
  A statement released by the Association asks the State 
Census 
Commission to ban DPTM activists from pressuring Islamized 
Macedonians "into falsifying their Macedonian nationality and 
native Macedonian language" in order to fully "become 
assimilated" and turn Turk. 
  The Macedonian authorities expect the census, which began on 
Tuesday, to show an incomparably smaller number of members of 
various nationalities, than leaders of national parties claim. 
  According to the 1991 census, F.Y.R.O.M. had 2.3 million 
inhabitants, including 21 percent ethnic Albanians (427,000), 
while Albanian leaders claim that there are between 800,000 and 
one million members of that minority. 
  Also, according to the same census, there are only 50,000 
Serbs in that former Yugoslav republic. Serbs do not recognize 
the results of that census and a representative of Serbs and 
Montenegrins in the F.Y.R.O.M. says there are about 250,000 
Serbs there.

<F P=106> [Interview with Petar Gosev, leader of the Democratic Party, </F>
by Branko Geroski; place and date not given: "Brutal Actions 
Hurt"] 
  [Text] They use cannibalistic and nepotistic methods 
in politics whereas I must act constructively. 
  We conclude our series of discussions with political party 
leaders with an interview with Petar Gosev, the leader of the 
Democratic Party, a party which is a perennial topic of fierce 
discussions. 
<H5>  Dirty Methods </H5>
  [Geroski] Mr. Gosev, do you think that with increasing 
frequency you have played the role of zealous critic rather than 
of a leader trying creatively to develop something new? 
  [Gosev] Let me immediately say that that is not the way I 
think. I have heard this remark, especially by people in power 
and those around them. Such people can fabricate the most dirty 
things, spread them daily among the public using the dirtiest 
"social warfare" methods, while we must counter them with plans 
for the present and the future. They engage in black 
marketeering while accusing others. Their people are involved in 
illegal deals for which they blame others. Their people trade in 
import and export permits and compensation agreements; they grab 
housing and free shops, whereas we, or I personally, must 
counter them with "projects." They block the work of the 
parliament expecting that I or other members of the opposition 
will answer with projects which would unblock it. The members of 
the coalition held the highest possible positions in the 
government for decades, including the time when most of the 
foreign loans were "gobbled up," while accusing others of the 
same. They are applying cannibalistic and nepotistic methods in 
politics, while asking of me to be constructive. This reminds me 
of the time when a single party ruled: "Do not criticize, just 
offer suggestions and we, at the top, we shall see whether your 
suggestions are smart and whether we shall adopt them." What 
projects are needed in order to block black marketeering, 
corruption, the plunder of public capital, the daily violation 
of the Constitution and the laws, discrimination against the 
people, nepotism, and the fearful spreading of incompetence in 
government, assigning political commissars to the information 
media, increasing party involvement in the top police ranks, and 
so on, if not to enable those who are doing all of this (and not 
only this alone), making it possible, supporting it, or not 
preventing it, although this is their duty, while in power? 
  [Geroski] When we speak of projects, we think of standards, 
of unemployment, of the retired, of health, schools.... 
  [Gosev] Yes, I too think about them. However, the latter 
cannot be achieved without eliminating the former. Furthermore, 
on the basis of what rules of parliamentary democracy should the 
opposition draft projects for those in power and submit such 
projects to them, telling them, "here is a project, see what you 
can do about it while you keep on ruling!" On the other hand, 
very basic amendments aimed at correcting ordinary stupidities 
are simply rejected with grins of satisfaction. We do not intend 
to provide them on a daily basis with this type of 
"satisfaction." To the voters I speak of our realities, of what 
we would accomplish if we are in power. Furthermore, we shall 
present our electoral program which, with or without projects, 
will be directed at the voters and not at those currently in 
power. 
<H5>  Gosev--Nationalist or Not? </H5>
  [Geroski] You consider yourselves a party of the political 
center. Today you are being described as a member of the 
national bloc, while others even describe you as a nationalistic 
party.... 
  [Gosev] We are a party of the political center, and that is 
what we shall remain. Labels used by political competitors will 
change nothing. We have already seen this: If you are not with 
them, there must be something wrong with you. I hear labels such 
as "Gosev has gone to the right," "he has become a nationalist," 
or else "he has proclaimed a confused type of nationalism!" I am 
convinced that I am wherever the national and state interests of 
the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] are. I am convinced that it is the other 
people who should think about where they stand. However, as was 
the case in the past, they will realize this later and, 
naturally, apply the greatest possible pressure to prove that 
they have always been in favor of what happened (if it was good) 
or against it (if it was bad). I read somewhere that a Russian 
philosopher wrote that there are two types of nationalism: 
zoological and creative. The first type encourages the 
irrational features of a people and leans toward intoxication, 
and inner triumph, and rejects criticism. The second not only 
allows criticism but provides it. It is not cut off from the 
trunk of the tree, rather it wants to enrich it with new 
meanings and fruit. In our country, there also are the so-called 
"anationals." They simply want to be merely citizens, members of 
a country, regardless of its name. They would like immediately 
to become citizens of the world. They want to live in the world 
as a global village. This is splendid. This may happen 
eventually. This may be the only formula that will save the 
world. Perhaps. I would like this too. I would like before that 
happens to practice the Olympic slogan, "We are one." But what 
about until then? On the one hand, there we are with the 
splendid humanistic slogan of "fraternity and unity," and on the 
other, there they are (with others among them as well) with 
their zoological nationalism. They would like to eliminate "our 
kind" or else tell us that we are one, but of their own kind, 
and take us over, either part of us or the entire "unrecruited" 
remainder of the Republic of Macedonia. Over the past 50 years, 
their practice of the otherwise splendid formula of "fraternity 
and unity" changed the demographic structure of Macedonia. The 
result today is expressed as follows: "Macedonia is not a 
unitarian state" or "it will not be a unitarian state." If such 
is the case, Macedonia will not be a state at all. This is worth 
thinking about, is it not? Everyone must see where he is: to the 
left, the right, in the center, or.... 
  [Geroski] Those who try to estimate your electoral chances 
are unable to agree on whether you are "rallying" around you the 
voters disappointed by the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian 
National Unity] or by the social democrats and the liberals. Are 
you indeed a party of the disappointed electorate? 
  [Gosev] The way things are, and given the increased number 
of 
sympathizers of the DP [Democratic Party], I fear that we may 
become a disappointed country. Seriously speaking, your 
questions are not serious. Our answer to this is the following: 
Those who are in power do not need a new party, a new 
alternative. However, if you are waiting for a more specific 
answer, most of the present membership (about 11,000) consists 
of former members of the SKM [League of [Communists of 
Macedonia] or the SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of 
Macedonia], the Liberal Party, or individuals who have never 
been members of any party. It is true that neither sympathizers 
nor members are satisfied with this type of government, for 
which reason I do not understand the meaning of your question 
about us being the party of the disappointed. 
  [Geroski] What is Petar Gosev's view of the idea of a 
coalition with the VMRO-DPMNE? 
  [Gosev] The elections in the 103rd district indicated that 
if 
the government does not form a coalition, it is bound to lose 
the elections. That is, actually, what happened and "rescued" 
the government from a defeat. In connection with our electoral 
tactics, we are considering what would be the best way to defeat 
the current coalition. The possibilities are obviously greater 
if the opposition parties (those of any significance) develop 
some kind of electoral cooperation. We have still not 
definitively determined how intensive such cooperation should be 
and the form it should adopt. Actually, we still have time to 
reach a final decision. Naturally, this also depends on the 
wishes and interests of the other opposition parties. 
  [Geroski] Do you find an international understanding of your 
views, considering the international support given to the 
Gligorov regime? 
  [Gosev] Interest in the DP is clearly increasing. An 
increasing number of foreign diplomats, representatives of 
foreign countries, and newsmen are interested in having 
discussions with us. We openly present our views, profoundly 
trusting that they are consistent with Macedonian state 
interests. So far, there have been no cases of misunderstanding. 
On the contrary, we have noted a high degree of accord and 
understanding, even in connection with our views concerning 
relations with Greece. In the case of Greece, although they 
dispute our own views sometimes, quite frequently they note the 
complexity of the situation and suggest a compromise with 
Greece, although confidentially they say that they are on our 
side. 
<H5>  Conversion and Mimicry </H5>
  [Geroski] We assume that the current electoral theme adopted 
by you and your party will be one of so-called conversion: You 
are indeed a "refugee" from the SDSM, a person about whom it is 
being said that he "brought" Kiro Gligorov to Macedonia (and is 
now criticizing him), a person who formed a party with people 
who, until yesterday, fiercely criticized him. What is Petar 
Gosev's answer to this? 
  [Gosev] This will not be our current theme. Many themes are 
much more important. Many among those who accuse us of 
conversion lack the moral right to do so. Specifically, the 
leaderships of the current coalition parties consist of the 
former SKM, and some of them incidentally, have had double the 
amount of "apprenticeship" in that party and have been for 
decades been part of the ruling team of the one-party system. 
They abandoned it, and now are once again together, struggling 
for power. I may be accused of conversion. I opposed the League 
of Communists platform and drafted a different platform long 
before they did, even while the country was still ruled by a 
single party. These people agreed with the new platform. 
Therefore, they too converted. However, looking at the way they 
work, the way they consider such conversion and the aspects on 
the basis of which they look at it, and considering the cadres 
which are promoting and revitalizing their platform, they once 
again aspire to be in power (the majority of them were, until 
the very last moment, against a market economy and pluralism, 
and against the state independence of Macedonia), and one could 
say that they did not convert but, as your respectable newspaper 
would say, they were not subject to a metamorphosis but remained 
like ideological dinosaurs and resorted merely to mimicry. My 
political credo and basic ideological line and system of basic 
values have been defined for quite some time. I did not avoid, 
naturally, making the necessary modifications. I separated 
myself from those who did not undertake any kind of ideological 
conversion (those who support the program of the League of 
Communists of 1950) or those whose ideology and system of values 
consist of remaining in power and ruling for the sake of 
fulfilling their personal objectives only. As to the fact that I 
have joined those who, until yesterday, attacked me fiercely, 
let me say the following: To be attacked by a political rival is 
one thing; but when you are being attacked secretly, like 
Brutus, by someone who thought of as a close supporter is an 
entirely different matter. I ask you to whom would you feel 
closer? For the latter, the people have suitable universally 
familiar sayings, I do not have to repeat them. My former 
political rivals, however, rarely resorted to attacking my 
personality. Frequently, they displayed greater respect for my 
activities and individualism, focusing their criticism on the 
old party along with its entire legacy of the past.

<F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party leader Kiro Popovski by </F>
Branko Geroski; place and date not given: "We Are Not an 
Appendage of the Coalition!"] 
  [Text] I don't know which big parties people think we 
are an appendage of. Some of those parties, however, fell below 
us in popularity. 
  We are continuing our series of interviews with prominent 
party leaders with an interview with the leader of the Socialist 
Party, Kiro Popovski. It is interesting that this is Popovski's 
first interview with the press since the first elections, at 
least according to his own records. 
  [Geroski] In view of the results of the by-elections in 
several electoral districts, including the latest ones in the 
103d, and especially the results of some public opinion polls, 
one gets the impression that your party's standing, at least in 
comparison with certain others, let us say, has shown growth, 
which is being perceived as a surprise.... 
  [Popovski] The surprise is a consequence of the simplified 
assessment of the standings of political parties, which are 
reduced to the number of deputies in parliament. That figure 
does not actually correspond to the number of votes that we 
received from the citizens. Let me recall that in the first 
elections we received about 95,000 votes--the other parties 
received more, but not as many as the difference in the number 
of deputy seats seems to indicate. In any case, you will agree 
that any party's standing is best shown through support in the 
elections themselves, which means that it will evidently be 
demonstrated in the next elections. In some cases, there may be 
indications from the results of several parliamentary 
by-elections during this term, but not just in the 103d, in 
addition to public opinion polls, especially those of the Gallup 
Institute. In general, I think that we can be satisfied with the 
Socialist Party's standing, and especially with the fact that in 
all those tests we did not have any fluctuations and declines, 
which indicates stability in membership, sympathizers, and 
support. I think that that is also confirmed by the results that 
we achieved in the previous three by-elections. In two electoral 
districts, our candidates were in second place, and in all 
three, we got into the second round. As far as the 103d is 
concerned, we have a large membership and sympathizers there, 
and consequently part of this electoral district is represented 
by our deputy in the City Assembly. 
<H5>  Without an Inheritance </H5>
  [Geroski] Why, then, didn't you decide to try your luck 
independently? 
  [Popovski] Such proposals were made, and we were prepared; 
we 
even had our own candidate. Nevertheless, because of the 
polarization that occurred and the political grouping that was 
expected, we assessed that we would achieve better results if we 
came forward with a joint candidate. I think that our 
participation was significant in the outcome of the election 
campaign, and that fact is also acknowledged by the other 
coalition partners. At the same time, it was a sort of test to 
see how much our sympathizers and the sympathizers of the other 
two parties would accept our decision on a joint approach. In 
discussion groups and conversations in this electoral district, 
we received broad support for this platform from citizens. In 
any case, these days our party is having several meetings and 
discussion groups throughout the republic, and almost nowhere 
have we been in a situation in which we have had to interrupt 
them, as has happened to several other parties. 
  [Geroski] In the past there was an impression that your 
party 
was, in a certain way, to put it crudely, an appendage of the 
coalition or of the major parties, but the results show that in 
the future a different balance of power is possible. How much is 
that influenced by the fact that you are one of the parties 
which inherited an infrastructure, in terms of personnel, office 
spaces, possibly even money...? 
  [Popovski] Let me tell you at once--we did not inherit any 
kind of office spaces. In almost all the municipalities, we get 
the same treatment as all the other parties: As part of the 
distribution of office spaces, in the majority of 
municipalities, we only got one office. Other parties are far 
better situated than we are. Nevertheless, probably through 
inertia, and in view of the situation in several other political 
structures, that is being said of us, but it is not true. It is 
true that even before pluralism we had a well-equipped 
infrastructure, and that for the past four years that 
infrastructure has continued to function throughout the entire 
republic. Otherwise, with respect to what you were saying--an 
appendage--I don't know what big party you are thinking of, 
since some of those big parties have dropped below us in 
popularity. Furthermore, we have clearly declared that we are 
finally getting rid of all those former encumbrances and that 
the Socialist Party is acting as an independent political 
entity, with its own platform and positions. The fact that in 
some discussions, in parliament and elsewhere, our positions 
coincide with those of some large parties, which are primarily 
civic-oriented, is a result of the closeness of our programs. We 
are in a coalition now, and the party that has the largest 
number of deputies has the most say in the coalition, so someone 
thus draws the conclusion that we are under the wing of some 
party, which is not true. Figuratively speaking, the 28 deputies 
of that party have as much weight as our six, since neither they 
nor we can form a majority in parliament by ourselves. 
<H5>  Coalition for November? </H5>
  [Geroski] Will that ruling coalition, which is now also the 
campaign coalition from the 103d, maintain itself until November? 
  [Popovski] I would like to remind you of something, although 
it will perhaps sound immodest: In 1990, the Socialist Party was 
the only one that had a realistic assessment of what would 
happen on the political scene in the republic. We established 
that assessment on the basis of the situation after the initial 
results from the parliamentary elections in Croatia and 
Slovenia. We realistically estimated that two national blocs 
would be created in the republic, and would not have a civic 
orientation; and that if the democratic parties were not united, 
their performance would be significantly worse. For that 
purpose, we also published a special declaration that year 
regarding the formation of a coalition of democratic forces in 
Macedonia. It is well-known that that coalition was not 
fulfilled; the only ones to join us were PCER [Party for the 
Full Emancipation of Romanies] and the Association of Macedonian 
Muslims. We estimate that in the next elections as well there 
will be a grouping of parties, since I do not believe that with 
this kind of political map in Macedonia one party can win the 
elections. It has also been demonstrated that the formation of a 
coalition between two rounds or after elections is hard to 
achieve, and without the same effects as in an election 
campaign. So far, there have not been any really direct talks on 
this level, except for this attempt in the 103d. I expect that 
soon every party will prepare realistic assessments of its own 
capabilities, and that there will be a grouping. There are 
already indications in the national bloc, and I assume that 
there will be a corresponding grouping among the parties of the 
nationalities. The parties that are now acting jointly are 
arguing that they are civic and democratic, and I think that in 
this case as well common interests may be found for the 
formation of a campaign coalition. In any case, if such a 
coalition is formed, we will urge that it be exclusively on an 
equal basis, and based on a clearly defined program and mutual 
obligations, since the one we have now is far from what it 
should be, and that is why we have this situation in parliament 
and elsewhere. 
  [Geroski] Entering that kind of coalition will be hampered 
by 
the voters' "memory" that that government coalition has one more 
member--the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity]. That will 
also be one of the key campaign themes that will be pushed by 
the opposition.... 
  [Popovski] I don't know whether any party is proceeding on 
the basis of an assessment that if it gains power it will 
exclude representatives of the nationalities in Macedonia, 
although from the political and legal standpoint, in a pluralist 
and parliamentary system, the party that wins the elections also 
assumes power. Nevertheless, I think that excluding the 
nationalities from power would mean the further exacerbation of 
interethnic relations and an intensification of mutual distrust, 
which will contribute to separating and homogenizing them, which 
in turn will lead to mutual conflicts. After all, that has also 
been demonstrated on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. I 
don't know why or with which of the nationalities' parties we 
would enter a coalition--our example with PCER shows that it can 
be done, if a firm program and elements for the functioning of 
such a coalition are prepared. Nevertheless, the hindrance that 
you are talking about does perhaps exist, since there is 
speculation that the coalition that exists now means the 
abandonment of any sort of principled policy by the parties that 
associate with the PDP. They want to use those national parties 
to create an artificial hindrance, in order to lower the 
standing of the coalition's parties. I think, however, that the 
citizens will be able to assess realistically what is what. 
<H5>  "Rigid" or Principled? </H5>
  [Geroski] At the last two meetings of the Assembly, there 
have been incidents (the stalemate over the electoral law, the 
problems with the Census Law), which seem to be increasing that 
risk.... 
  [Popovski] What you are saying to me now is confirmation of 
my previous assessment about the principled nature of the 
positions of these parties in the coalition. If we were to act 
in an unprincipled manner, that crisis would probably not have 
occurred: We would accept all the demands of the participants in 
the coalition and we would adopt all those laws without any 
problem. It is precisely because of that principled approach 
that we cannot comply with demands that are unacceptable to us. 
That is why the crisis is occurring. 
  [Geroski] They say that you are somehow the most principled 
of the principled, not to say the "most rigid" with respect to 
that so-called conciliation of the Albanians in the coalition. 
Is that true? 
  [Popovski] And now, whether I am "rigid" or not... I think 
that I am principled. Our slogan in 1990 was, and still is, that 
no one in Macedonia should be threatened because of his ethnic 
identity and that all citizens must be equal before the 
Constitution and the laws. Coexistence and mutual trust have to 
be ensured. Any other alternative will be fatal to our state. 
Some people perceive the fact that I am principled to the end as 
my being harsh on certain issues, or "rigid," as you say. I 
think, however, that it has to be assessed realistically. Some 
things in our country are still not fully developed as legal 
solutions, and one must always take into account expediency and 
reality. For more radical changes in mutual relations, it is 
also necessary to have a broader awareness among the citizens, a 
higher level of economic development, and greater mutual trust. 
  [Geroski] Finally, the last question: The elections are 
close. What is the minimum that the Socialist Party will 
consider a success in these elections? 
  [Popovski] I don't know whether any party could give you an 
answer to that question. In any case, if we exclude the 
Socialist Party of Serbia, we are the only socialist party in 
the former Yugoslav republics that has not only survived, but 
has also done continuously risen in popularity. Probably the 
minimum will be that we continue to remain in the inner circle 
of the political parties that have a fundamental influence upon 
the overall policy and development of the republic. That is not 
just for the sake of our political interests and party standing, 
but also so that we can make our own contribution to the state's 
survival and to ensuring prospects for its development.

    [Editorial Report] Since early April, newspapers in The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) have featured 
articles on a package of three draft laws involving the election 
of the country's president, proposed changes to the law on 
parliamentary elections, and on the distribution of electoral 
districts. Of these, only the law on presidential elections has 
been passed. 
  Reviewing the government's performance on the electoral law 
in an article published in NOVA MAKEDONIJA on 12 and 13 April, 
Lazar Lubacevski commented that the current draft is almost 
identical to the one the same government introduced in July 1993 
with the same injunction: This needs to be adopted immediately! 
When the government encountered opposition to its draft, 
Lubacevski observed, it withdrew the bill from the agenda and 
remained silent for eight months. According to Lubacevski, the 
government should have opened The discussion with the 
participation of citizens' forums and the extraparliamentary 
parties, and then scheduled a debate on the law in September. 
However, one part of the governing coalition, Lubacevski said 
without elaborating, did not like "the expansion of the system 
because it would interfere with the existing monopolistic 
situation." 
  In order to leave the existing 120 majority-vote districts 
intact, Lubacevski continued, the government decided not to 
change the constitutionally mandated 20 seats chosen by 
proportional representation. The government should have 
proposed, according to Lubacevski, a combination of 40-percent 
proportional representation seats and 60-percent majority vote. 
This would have led to the creation of 100 new districts and 
solved the problem of very uneven distribution of registered 
voters in each district. According to Lubacevski, this figure 
varies from 6,000 to 17,000 and is one of the chief problems 
among the coalition partners. 
  Skopje weekly PULS commentator Aleksandar Comovski, in a 
feature published on 29 April, noted that the party of the 
Albanian population, the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP), 
wants a 50-50 split between proportional represention and 
majority-vote seats. Comovski calculated that, even with the 
additional proportional representation seats, the PDP would 
probably not get more than one-third of the 140 seats. Further, 
he advised, the PDP should consider carefully whether 
proportional representation might have negative consequences for 
the PDP, such as heightening the danger of ethnic confrontation.

  [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Financing the 
Electoral Campaign: Some Walk, Some Ride in Ferraris," published 
on page 17 of the 30 April issue of the Skopje daily NOVA 
MAKEDONIJA, journalist Sanja Vasic examines the problem of 
election campaign financing in The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia (FYROM). As the autumn parliamentary elections 
approach, Vasic writes, some examination of how to finance them 
should be made. The parliamentarians, however, have set aside 
consideration of the draft law on political parties, which is 
supposed to regulate financing, as well as the law on 
parliamentary elections, until the very end of their term of 
office. 
  The elections are supposed to take place within six months, 
Vasic says, and the issue of financing the electoral campaign is 
crucial, especially for the extraparliamentary parties, because 
they will not get much help from the state budget. According to 
the proposed law, 30 percent of the funds budgeted for the 
election are intended for the parties that received at least 3 
percent of the votes in the last general election, held during 
October-December 1990. The remainder are to be distributed to 
the parties currently in parliament according to the number of 
seats they hold. It remains to be seen whether the funds will be 
available for use before the electoral campaign begins, Vasic 
states. He notes that this is not the only "card" the 
parliamentary parties can play, since they already have sizeable 
funds at their disposal, as well as donations from abroad. 
Whether that money will suffice, however, is debatable, Vasic 
observes. 
  According to Vasic, the Social Democratic Alliance of 
Macedonia (SDSM) is financed by membership dues, income from the 
"Demokratija" publishing house, and donations. This party, which 
is in the governing coalition, would like to have the draft law 
passed in its current form, without setting spending limits, he 
adds. In practice, the SDSM will attempt to respect the 
prohibition on money from abroad, says Danco Petrovski, chef de 
cabinet of the presidency of the SDSM, writes Vasic. 
  The VMRO-DPMNE (Internal Macedonian Revolutionary 
Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity) 
interprets the lack of progress on the law on political parties 
as an indication that the government is intentionally blocking 
the resolution of the issue of party financing in order to 
restrict political activity by the opposition, reports Vasic. He 
cites Dosta Dimovska, the party's deputy chairman, "The parties 
in the governing coalition have an extensive source of financing 
through the property that they have at their disposal, from dark 
recesses in the budget, and from their control over enterprises, 
but they block adoption of the law on political parties." 
According to Vasic, the VMRO-DPMNE sees limitations on donations 
as unnecessary. It considers that enormous amounts are necessary 
for campaigns and that there should be a way to equalize 
resources. Although the VMRO-DPMNE receives occasional gifts, 
the party has no foreign donors. Dimovska also says: "As far as 
sympathizers in the business community are concerned, we keep 
their identity secret because of government repression." 
  Vasic reports that the Liberal Party, another member of the 
governing coalition, is preparing its strategy and is concerned 
that contributions to political parties might lead to certain 
groups or individuals having undue influence. Ace Kocevski, the 
Liberal Party secretary, says there is a need for a precise law. 
  Civic Liberal Party Chairman Boris Geraj comments that 
extraparliamentary parties do not have a chance in the area of 
financing. He believes that budget funds should be distributed 
equally or not at all. "Some go on foot, others in Ferraris," 
Geraj points out. In his opinion, business interests are 
self-serving and financing from them should be excluded.

<F P=106> [Article by Zoran Petrov: "The Thorny Path Leading to </F>
Self-Discovery"] 
  [Text] It is now clear that the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs is still not free from a variety of political pressures. 
What happened to the "eight" who were the main protagonists in 
numerous affairs and subsequent police cases? We have a variety 
of collages of police cases, scandals, and affairs. 
  One of the most disrupted institutions of the system, the 
first to be hit by the so-called new democratic changes, was, 
unquestionably, the police. Even the most superficial study of 
the situation that has developed over the past three to four 
years would reveal the existence of politics in all areas of 
Macedonian governmental affairs. A look at the work of the 
Assembly of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] would show that, once again, the 
police were one of the most extensively discussed items on its 
agenda, judging by the heat generated by the debates and various 
accusations. 
  What is now clear is that the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
(MVR) has still not attained the quality expected by the 
Macedonian public. It should be nonpoliticized and 
party-neutral, with the sole task of maintaining peace and order 
in the state, protect the citizens and, naturally, their 
property, and above all, treat equally all subjects of the 
state, regardless of their party, political, or ideological 
affiliation. Internal quarrels, power struggles, and, above all, 
divisiveness unquestionably remained the main features of that 
ministry. Even the latest actions taken by Pavle Trajanov, the 
former deputy minister for operational activities of the MVR, 
related to open charges that some government departments had 
become involved with organized crime, and the cover-ups and 
denials issued by his boss, Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, most 
clearly indicate the insurmountable split within the Macedonian 
police. Actually, one way or another, such relations are part of 
the history of the MVR. 
<H5>  As a Starter, the Eight </H5>
  The first known police affair took place in 1989-90. It is 
referred to as "the case of the eight." It was eight 
high-ranking police officials who promoted the use of the 
then-existing primary organization of the League of Communists 
in settling matters with the Republic's internal affairs 
secretariat, which brought to the surface a number of 
machinations, abuses, and distortions in the work of the police 
authorities. The group consisted of Pavle Trajanov, Slobodan 
Bogoevski, Stanoja Bogev, Grozdan Cvetkovski, Aleksandar 
Dinevski, Mile Ilievski, Bedjet Bedjeti, and Jovan Caminski. 
Bearing in mind the fact that Aleksandar Andonovski, the former 
secretary, reacted to their initiative with a repressive measure 
(all of them were suspended), they made their demands and views 
public. Initially the Belgrade media and, subsequently, the 
Macedonian press actively discussed the arguments of the 
initiators and, as we know, at that time the "case of the eight" 
was also considered by the highest party and state Macedonian 
bodies (the Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia and 
the Central Committee of the Communist League of Macedonia). 
Vasil Tupurkovski and Petar Gosev were actively involved in 
dealing with that matter. They threw their full support to the 
"rebels," as a result of which changes were made in the then 
police leadership (Republic Secretary Andonovski and his deputy 
Kompyanov were replaced). However, no real change occurred in 
the structure of the service. 
  Quite interesting in this context is the subsequent fate of 
the eight, for in a number of areas it was precisely they who 
were the main protagonists in police investigations. They 
achieved their real "rehabilitation" during the period of 
pluralism, following the appointment of Jordan Mijalkov (who 
tragically died in an accident on 19 December 1991) as minister 
of internal affairs. Trajanov and Bogoevski were appointed to 
the highest possible positions of under secretaries of public 
and state security, respectively. Bedzet and Bogoev were given 
deputy positions; Cvetkovski was appointed director of the 
Security Cadre Training Center. Ilievski was made councilor, 
while Dinevski and Caminski were given command positions. 
Essentially, the first case was the suicide of Mile Ilnevski in 
May 1992, which was caused, according to subsequent reports, by 
emotional disturbance. Still, the unofficial version of the 
event was that the reason for this nervous illness which led to 
Ilnevski's suicide was triggered by his awareness that his home 
telephone had been tapped on the instruction of his former 
"fellow fighters," headed by Bogoevski, and suspicions that he 
too had been involved in the then affair of the "bomb throwers" 
in Veles. 
  The second case, which bore all the marks of a real 
police-political scandal, took place in August of that same 
year, under the "management" of Aleksandar Dinevski, the head of 
the SDB [State Security Service]. The official police version 
was that official documents were found in Dinevski's possession, 
which he had passed on to the VMRO-DPMNE [Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian 
National Unity]. At the news conference which took place on that 
subject, he accused the MVR of illegal tapping of telephones, 
including that of the VMRO-DPMNE. Subsequently, Dinevski became 
a member of that party and today is member of its leadership in 
the Cair township in Skopje. All that remained of this entire 
scandal was the Duvlo case (repeatedly raised in the Macedonian 
Parliament), and the frequent subject of party influences in the 
police. Meanwhile, immediately after Dinevski, Jovan Caminski, 
one of the "eight," left the police. He was transferred from 
chief to private counsel. Today he is in private business. It is 
believed that he is too has ties with the MVR, with one of the 
former "eight," Pavle Trajanov. 
<H5>  Are the Police Becoming Politicized? </H5>
  Of the former compact group of "rebels," only Trajanov and 
Bogoevski were left in leading MVR positions. They actually 
controlled the entire police organization. That is precisely why 
the public was quite surprised to learn that the public security 
under secretary was made deputy minister for operative affairs 
(November 1993). In the police hierarchy, this is a very high 
rank. Trajanov himself said at that time that he was surprised 
by the government's decision and that the reasons for this act, 
in his view, lie elsewhere rather than the official statement of 
the minister that it was a matter of routine cadre rotation in 
anticipation of the reorganization of the MVR and the 
elimination of the position of assistant secretary. It was 
public knowledge that this was the result of reliable 
information provided to the press concerning the then topical 
affair of the "all-Albanian paramilitary force." Along with 
this, the claim was made public that Trajanov was replaced 
because of his closeness to Petar Gosev's Democratic Party. 
  The latter view became topical once again after Trajanov's 
statement to NOVA MAKEDONIJA, dated 12 March 1994, to the effect 
that some government ministries had become involved with 
organized crime, which excited the public once again. The 
government held a meeting on this subject and its views were 
presented at a news conference by Minister Ljubomir Frckovski, 
who distanced himself from the statements of his assistant and 
asked the latter to back up his claims by citing criminal 
charges within a "reasonable period" of about 10 days. The five 
or six criminal activities described by the MVR Operative 
Affairs Department apparently were not considered a sufficient 
argument by Frckovski. On his suggestion, therefore, on 4 April 
last, by removing Trajanov from the government, he was once 
again transferred (without any explanation) from the function of 
assistant minister to senior adviser, which, in terms of police 
terminology (and practice) is the last position to be held prior 
to retirement. What gives a political slant to this entire case 
is the fact that Trajanov's statement according to which the 
government was involved in organized crime, issued immediately 
before the elections at district 103 in the Skopje area, was 
exploited to the utmost by the Democratic Party in its electoral 
campaign, while at the television duel on the A-1 television 
channel between Aleksandar Tortevski (Democratic Party) and 
Nikola Popovski (SDSM [Social Democratic Alliance of 
Macedonia]), the latter directly accused Trajanov of acting 
together with Gosev by supplying his party with confidential 
police data (unequivocally related to the Dinevski case). 
  The ex-assistant minister rejected this claim as groundless 
and tendentious slander, emphasizing his initial statement that 
organized crime has penetrated the executive branch. Regardless 
of the final resolution of this case, it is obvious that 
internal upheavals and disagreements within the MVR are 
continuing, along with questions related to the involvement of 
individual cadres in party affairs. The process of conversion of 
that ministry is, obviously, not an easy one. This is quite 
clearly taking place in connection with a variety of political 
pressures and influences. Still, this phenomenon clearly stands 
out among other numerous political-police affairs, scandals, and 
events. 
<H5>  From "Cavern" to "the Twenty" </H5>
  The study of the case may lead to a general relative group 
classification. The first group would include the purely 
political police cases ("Tavern," "Blue Bird," and "Bulgarian 
Tracks"), which were debated twice in the Assembly. In the first 
case they were considered as specific agenda items; the second 
time they were within the context of the question addressed at 
Minister Frckovski. The second group of political scandals could 
be described as "professional" or as a "criticism of MVR 
actions." This includes the "Radolista," "Radovis," "Kuklis," 
"Bit Pazar," and "Djorce Petrov" cases, which were also 
extensively and lengthily debated in the Macedonian Parliament 
and about which one could stress as a characteristic feature the 
fact that, one way or another, daily political activities were 
the main actual reason. The third type of affairs, again 
involving the MVR, could be described as one of "status" or 
"interministerial." This includes, above all, the confrontation 
between the ministry and the defense department (the "military 
camps" case) and with the government's customs department on the 
subject of levying some customs fees. Actually, the fourth group 
consists of purely internal political scandals that pertain 
mostly to the abuse of police professionalism, involving theft 
and corruption among the police. Starting with October 1991, 
with the "600,000 German marks case," as a result of which one 
commanding officer and one chief of a political precinct were 
suspended, and ending with the latest cases in Sveti Nikol, 
Kocani, Tetovo, and Bitola, where, as a result of customs 
dealings or engaging in black marketeering and resale, most 
police chiefs were fired, the MVR has been a permanent topic of 
discussion. The case of the December 1992 "twenty" which was 
brought up in the first months of this year is special for not 
belonging to any group but being something entirely separate. It 
resembles the case of the "eight" not only because it is, once 
again, a question of the work of state security personnel but 
also the data submitted to the highest authorities in Macedonia 
indicating major deformations and abuses in the statutory and 
legal functions of the MVR. In this case, however, there was no 
conclusion to this prototype, which ended only as a case that 
did not result in major upheavals within the ministry. 
  In discussing the link between the police and politics, Dr. 
Djoko Tozi, professor at the public security faculty in Skopje, 
pointed out that this is a complex problem, after the system 
essentially based on the political police, known in the past as 
the "militia," broke down. According to him, this system favored 
the police and the state authorities and institutions and 
implemented its policy mainly with their help. With the 
breakdown of socialism, Dr. Tozi points out, our police made a 
serious attempt at changing itself. The way things are now, 
however, it is totally unable to get rid of politics. Those in 
power who openly claim that they absolutely oppose the 
politicizing of the police are engaged in a political farce, 
for, according to our interlocutor, the ruling party or class 
cannot implement any one of its objectives without having any 
influence on the police or in the army. 
  It is the general rule for countries in a state of 
transition 
that the first battle for power leads the parties to concentrate 
on taking over the police. This is taking place in our country 
as well, Tozi claims, in the course of which several scandals or 
events emerge. This is a classical effort on the part of some 
parties to take over the field of internal affairs. In his view, 
one of the clearest examples of this was the conversion of a 
high police official to the VMRO-DPMNE. We are familiar with 
other types of deals and even with the skillfully created crisis 
by the government among the coalition parties themselves in 
putting their own people in leading positions in the police, as 
was the case of the conflict between the LP and the SDSM. Some 
parties insisted on having their own people in key positions 
within the ministry, such as deputy secretary or assistant. 
  All of this, as Dr. Djoko Tozi insists, is the result of a 
still undefined type of society and undefined relations within 
the parties and their programs, and the fact that they are still 
in the phase of structuring and developing their social base. 
Within such an undefined status of the parties and an overall 
lack of stability, it is normal to strengthen the role of the 
police. That is why there is no scandal, affair, or case, 
according to our interlocutor, in which the police are not 
directly or indirectly involved. All it takes is to look at the 
"Tavern," "Blue Bird," "Kuklis," "Radovis," and others, 
according to Tozi, characterized by the fact that politics is 
the most important of their features. These are, first of all, 
political, and only then police cases, categorically claims the 
professor at the security faculty. Considering that the purpose 
of the MVR is, above all, to protect the interests of the 
citizens, these examples clearly prove that they are working as 
a function of politics. Most simply stated, we are facing a 
political struggle for power within the police which, according 
to Tozi, as a rule protects those who are in power. 
  Today the political police are not all that obvious, and it 
cannot be as it was in the period when all had to think alike, 
although, generally speaking, we cannot say that we have a 
depoliticized police, Tozi stresses. Its framework from the past 
remains and this is quite evident, Dr. Djoko Tozi and others 
said. 
<H5>  The Issue of Objective Factors </H5>
  According to Dr. Borce Davitkovski, docent at the School of 
Law in Skopje, several reasons contribute to the strengthening 
of the authoritative or repressive agencies of the state, most 
noteworthy among which are the police and the army. To begin 
with, the aspects and trends of authoritarian and repressive 
rule and behavior, familiar over the past 45 years of 
development of Macedonia, have still not disappeared. According 
to Davitkovski, in addition to these agencies this may be seen 
in all other political factors, for there is a constant search 
of traitors to the people and the state or else of enemies of 
the Macedonian cause. These are recurrences of the old system 
and in this case it is more a question of a mentality or a way 
of behaving. I claim that in the next 50 years as well this will 
be reflected also in the attitude of the administrative 
authorities and the other activists, our interlocutor insists. 
  The second reason, according to Davitkovski, is the factor 
that there is no true opposition in Macedonia, which in the 
present parliamentary structure would be realistic, and would 
act as a real shock absorber of the current political powers. On 
the contrary, Davitkovski categorically claims that we have a 
so-called double opposition: one within the parliament, which 
itself holds an inferior position, and a second within the 
government, which manifests itself only when it deems suitable. 
Such major factors provide a particularly fertile soil for 
strengthening the role of the police. The third and perhaps most 
important reason is the fact that in Macedonia there still has 
been no operational definition of the constitutional stipulation 
governing the division of powers. No amortization instruments 
between the legislative, executive, and judiciary have been 
provided for. Even within the executive authorities, Dr. 
Davitkovski says, no laws govern relations among its agencies. 
Taking into consideration the fact that no law has yet been 
passed on the administration of the state, the administrative 
authorities and the police work on the basis of rules of the 
past, based on the principle of the unity of power and not its 
separation, the logical result of which is the domination of the 
executive over the legislative authority and, within this 
framework, the domination of the state organs, including the 
police. Adding to this the fact that the judiciary, which relies 
on the police, has still not been structured, that same police 
assume a dominant position and objectively are in a position of 
being in charge of matters outside their jurisdiction, Dr. 
Davitkovski says. 
  The fourth major reason, in his view, which objectively 
determines the superiority of the police over the other social 
areas, is the process of their internal depoliticization. The 
people who work in the MVR, Davitkovski stresses, have been 
trained on the basis of a different system and a different way 
of acting. Therefore, they cannot lose overnight their way of 
thinking and acting. This will take a long time, along with the 
democratic evolution of the entire society. 
  The fact in which the views of Dr. Djoko Tozi and Dr. Borce 
Davitkovski coincide is the basic concept on the appearance, 
organization, shape, and way of work of the depoliticized 
police. This, according to them, means establishing the 
principle of absolute professionalism in the work of that body.

<H5>  There Still Is Fear of the Police </H5>
  A specific situation has developed in Macedonia. The police, 
which at the time of the withdrawal of the former Yugoslav 
People's Army were the only armed Macedonian component following 
the independence of the state, were also one of the most 
privileged institutions. As the only organized force during what 
may have been the most critical period for Macedonia, the police 
acquired great authority and a high reputation. 
  However, after the proclamation of independence of the state 
and the restoration of pluralism, and the numerous 
political-police affairs and scandals, once again the ordinary 
people experienced the old fear and mistrust of the police. A 
most common example is the following: Three weeks ago, in a 
television debate with the minister of internal affairs, the 
greatest number of viewers who asked questions insisted on 
remaining anonymous. What does this prove? Is this not an 
example of the reservation which the people still feel when it 
comes to the police? That is why I claim that the restoration of 
reciprocal trust is a duty, a historical process of the 
depoliticization of the police. 
<H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5>
<H5>  Dr. Borce Davitkovski, Docent, Law School in Skopje </H5>
<H5>  A Democratic Police Acts Automatically </H5>
  Let us take France as an example. In that country the 
minister of police may be a socialist, a communist, a Christian 
Democrat, a fascist, or a neofascist. To the police itself this 
is not all that important, for the police know their work: to 
protect the constitutional and legal order in France and the 
human rights and freedoms. Regardless of whether communists or 
fascists are demonstrating, the police stand aside. However, the 
moment the demonstrators threaten private property or the safety 
of the citizens, break a shop window, or beat up a passerby, the 
police act mercilessly. This is automatic. The police are not 
interested in whether the demonstrators may be ideologically 
supporters of their minister. That is precisely why we must see 
to it that our police are properly trained, expert, and 
professional with clearly defined obligations. Unfortunately, we 
are still waiting for this.

  [Editorial Report] In an article titled "Barns Are Full, 
Cashboxes Are Empty," published in the 14 June issue of the 
Skopje daily VECER in Macedonian on page 6, J. Pavlovski writes 
that the barley harvest has already begun in some regions in The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), where 64,000 
hectares have been sown. The Macedonians expect to harvest 
50,000 metric tons of brewery-grade barley, and the Macedonian 
breweries need 30,000 tons. The expected yields of various field 
crops are about 155,054 tons of barley, 15,000 tons of rye, 
1,070 tons of oil-bearing pods, and 798 tons of poppies. The 
acreage devoted to bread grains has been increased by about 
7,000 hectares for a total of 116,550 hectares. Part of the area 
sown has been affected by drought, especially in the Stip and 
Sveti Nikole districts, but the overall harvest is expected to 
be satisfactory. In fact, according to Pavlovski, the wheat 
harvest should set a record for Macedonia. Experts estimate that 
the average yields of wheat per hectare will be about 3,500 in 
the Pelagonija region, 3,200 in the Skopje region, and 4,000 in 
Polog. 
  Pavlovski notes, however, that a bountiful harvest does not 
depend only on weather conditions and the mobilization of 
workers and machinery, but is also influenced by the purchase 
prices for the crops and the amount purchased. According to 
Mioljub Panov, chairman of the "Zito Makedonija" milling and 
baking industry, because of the high guaranteed price of 10 
denars per kilogram, the purchase of bread grains will be 
limited. Eftim Ancev, minister of agriculture, forestry, and 
water management, says that, to the extent that that price has 
not been accepted by purchasers, the government will pay 
producers for the wheat. 
  The milling and baking industry is reluctant to buy bread 
grains not only because of the high prices (FYROM wheat costs 
$240.00 per ton, compared to $140.00 per ton for U.S. wheat), 
but also because of the increased supply of flour and wheat in 
stores, silos, and other storage bins, Pavlovski continues. 
According to data as of 30 April, there were 110,000 tons in 
reserve. According to Sande Djambazovski, deputy minister of 
agriculture, forestry, and water management, the Directorate for 
Material Reserves will purchase wheat from this year's crop that 
is not bought by the mills. 
  The purchase of bread grains by the milling and baking 
industry is also affected by financial considerations, according 
to Pavlovski. Because of unpaid loans, the banks are not able to 
extend credits to the milling and baking industry. For the 
anticipated purchase of 150,000 tons of wheat, about 1.5 billion 
denars will be needed. But that is not all: The state must 
secure an additional 300,000,000 denars for the producers. Kiro 
Dokuzovski, secretary for agriculture, food processing, and 
tobacco industry in the Chamber of Commerce, says that the price 
is not the focus of the conflict for the producers, nor is the 
fact that they will accept whatever quantities of bread grains 
that are needed. He believes that the state must issue orders to 
control imports because there is no justification for 
uncontrolled imports when the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, 
and Water Management is attempting to defend the reserves to 
ensure supplies for the market. The producers, however, do not 
want to repeat the old practice of not knowing where to get 
money at the best rate or, after a long wait, having their 
assets devalued.

  [Editorial Report] S. Padori reports on the expanding 
capacity of the REK (Republic Electric Power Combine) "Bitola" 
in an article on page 7 in the Macedonian-language Skopje daily 
VECER, published on 19 May. The Bitola plant, which is the 
largest in The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), 
will expand its generating capacity by 45 megawatts when the 
overhaul is completed toward the end of September. According to 
Padori, the three heat and power units that have generated 210 
megawatts each will be renovated, raising the capacity of each 
unit to 225 megawatts, thus increasing the Bitola plant's 
capacity to 675 megawatts. 
  The idea of expanding the capacity of REK "Bitola" dates 
from 
the signing of an agreement with Russian partners from Saint 
Petersburg in October by Mr. Podoljski. According to the 
assistant director of the Bitola plant, Pande Lazarevski, it is 
significant that the increased power capacity can be obtained 
with the small investment of $4.5 million, or about $100,000 per 
megawatt.

  [Text] Warsaw, 25 Jun--You have done a great deal for the 
reconciliation between our nations and a great deal for one 
Europe, President Lech Walesa said today at the Belweder while 
presenting the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Polish 
Republic to German President Richard von Weizsaecker. 
  Weizsaecker, whose visit to Poland is his last as president, 
then presented Lech Walesa with the Grand Cross of the Order of 
Merit, the highest German decoration. 
  Lech Walesa said: "In my country, you are considered a great 
friend of Poland and the Poles. You have always supported 
friendly relations, as well as understanding and neighborly 
cooperation. You were one of the first to speak out in favor of 
overcoming our difficult past and removing the barriers dividing 
our states and nations. It was you who said: Let us learn to 
live not against each other, but together. You said that at a 
time when admitting friendly feelings toward Poland was 
unpopular." 
  The president stressed that Richard von Weizsaecker is a 
politician who "wanted to use traditional Christian values such 
as truth, respect, love, and good as a measure for mutual 
interstate relations." "You also wanted these values to become 
a foundation of future Polish-German neighborliness. This has 
made you a worthy successor of the Konrad Adenauer idea. You 
believe, as he did, that the new Germany will become a good 
neighbor of Poland," Walesa added. 
  Weizsaecker said that, during his entire political life, 
relations between Poland and Germany "have been particularly 
close to my heart." "I would like to thank you and your fellow 
citizens for the leading role played by Poland under your 
leadership in gaining freedom for Europe," he told Lech Walesa. 
"While not forgetting the past, let us create the future 
together," the German president said. 
  Richard von Weizsaecker will be a guest of a conference on 
"A 
New Germany in a New World," organized by the Stefan Batory 
Foundation, the RESPUBLICA NOVA monthly, and the Robert Bosch 
Foundation.

  [Text] On Saturday, President Lech Walesa took part in a 
periodic program by the New Television Warsaw station [Nowa 
Telewizja Warszawa--NTW] entitled "And Now to Concrete Issues." 
The meeting, which took place in the Belweder Palace, was 
relayed live via satellite by all 12 regional TV stations 
carrying Polonia 1 programs, the NTW editorial office reported 
on 26 June. According to NTW, such relay and its scope occurred 
for the first time in the history of commercial television in 
Poland. 
  As it transpires from a communique sent to PAP, viewers 
across the whole country could ask the president questions 
directly thanks to special telephone links. Lech Walesa 
answered questions posed before and during the program for about 
35 minutes. The questions concerned diverse issues, among other 
things, local government elections and plans for the 
presidential election campaign, foreign policy, and Poland's 
participation in NATO. Questions were also asked about the 
president's attitude to the death penalty and the judiciary, in 
general. 
  Asked why such conversation was not carried by public 
television, which belongs to both the rulers and the ruled, Lech 
Walesa replied that he had never refused participation in public 
television programs but that he had never received an 
invitation. He also said that it would be ideal to make 
available those frequencies currently owned by the military to 
all interested broadcasters and let the harsh market rules 
decide on selection. He said, however, that the Army needs time 
and the necessary equipment to make these frequencies gradually 
available. 
  Asked if, besides the National Radio and TV Broadcasting 
Council [KRRiTV], there should be an institution controlling the 
press, the president replied that he is an opponent of political 
control in a democratic state and that, in any case, the press 
carries so many virtually scandalous reports that to deny them 
he would have to bring several court cases every day, the NTW 
statement reads. 
  [Warsaw Third Program Radio Network in Polish at 0900 GMT on 
26 June adds that NTW "has been broadcasting without a 
franchise" and "belongs to Nicola Grauso's Polonia 1 Television 
Network"]

<F P=106> [From the "Wiadomosci" newscast; relayed by Warsaw TV </F>
Polonia Network in Polish] 
  [Text] [Announcer Pienkowska] Deputy Finance Minister 
Henryk Chmielak has presented his resignation to Prime Minister 
Pawlak. As he said, he has received a number of offers from the 
private financial sector and now wishes to work there. 
  [Unidentified correspondent] For three months after the 
dismissal of Marek Borowski, Henryk Chmielak directed the 
Finance Ministry until the appointment of Grzegorz Kolodko to 
the post of finance minister. 
  [Begin Chmielak recording] I have received a number of very 
interesting offers from the commercial financial sector, very 
interesting in the professional sense, and I have applied to 
Prime Minister Pawlak and Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko in 
writing with a request for the opportunity to take advantage of 
these offers. [end recording] 
  [Correspondent] The Government Press Office was not capable 
of giving a reply to the question of whether and when the 
resignation might be accepted. Journalists were only told that 
Henryk Chmielak and Wojciech Misiag, a second deputy finance 
minister, are continuing to work on the Strategy for Poland 
program presented by Grzegorz Kolodko, the present finance 
minister. 
  Unofficially, there is also talk that Wojciech Misiag will 
leave the Finance Ministry, although not at his own request. 
Prime Minister Pawlak is to give him his dismissal notice on 
Monday [27 June]. We did not succeed in gaining confirmation of 
this news at the Office of the Council of Ministers. Wojciech 
Misiag himself did not wish to discuss this with the press. He 
invited them for Monday. Wojciech Misiag was appointed to the 
post of deputy finance minister by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek 
Balcerowicz in the fall of 1989. For four years, he was 
responsible for the preparation of successive state budgets.

  [Excerpt] During the Warsaw Radio morning slot "Signals of 
the Day" today, Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and 
finance minister, confirmed that there have been personnel 
changes in his ministry. Two deputy ministers--Wojciech Misiag 
and Henryk Chmielak--have been dismissed. 
  [Begin Kolodko recording] Today I am handing a thank you 
letter to Dr. Chmielak and Minister Misiag, who will now be 
working in a different capacity. This is in connection with 
certain changes arising from the implementation of the Strategy 
for Poland program, which is now official and has been adopted 
by the Sejm. They are leading experts and we do not have enough 
of them. They will be helping us out, using their experience, 
expertise, and qualifications in a different way. 
  At 0805, on behalf of Prime Minister Pawlak, I will be 
making 
appropriate nominations. Dr. Krzysztof Kalicki from the Main 
School of Commerce, a leading expert in monetary policy, will be 
appointed as first deputy finance minister and secretary of 
state. Professor Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, from the Law Department 
at Warsaw University, who was until now my adviser on budget 
policy, will be appointed under secretary of state, with 
responsibility for supervising the budget sector. 
  I would like to add that these are not the only changes. 
These are the changes that are being implemented today in this 
ministry. [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Warsaw, 26 Jun--The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] 
had registered lists with their candidates for councillors in 
141 cities out of the total of 142 cities where proportional 
representation elections were held; the alliance won in 75 
cities, including four where it won the absolute majority. In 
three cities it did not win a single seat, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, 
the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SDRP] general 
secretary, announced at a Sunday meeting of the party's Supreme 
Council. 
  The SLD obtained an absolute majority in Sosnowiec, 
Ostrowiec 
Swietokrzyski, Walbrzych, and Wloclawek. In the remaining 
cities, SLD participation in exercising power would require 
talks and agreements. Talks are being held in a dozen or so 
centers, among others, Plock and Jelenia Gora, Szmajdzinski said. 
  In his view, the alliance filled 27.2 percent of seats in 
multiple-seat constituencies. Compared with parliamentary 
elections, it had a worse result in 69 cities and a better one 
in 29. In 23, there was no change. The largest drop in the 
SLD's popularity was noted in Katowice Province. 
  Analysis of the results in single-seat constituencies is 
still continuing. According to data available now, the alliance 
has won an absolute majority in seven rural parishes. During 
today's meeting, the SDRP Supreme Council will make an initial 
analysis of the party associates' performances in the election 
campaign.

  [Text] The National Council of the Union of Labor [UP] has 
made a decision on joining the opposition to Prime Minister 
Waldemar Pawlak's government. UP has accused the government 
coalition of failing to implement the policies announced during 
the election campaign and of continuing the policies of the 
previous governments. UP has also criticized the government's 
Strategy for Poland program. According to UP, this document 
assumes a further exacerbation of the uneven distribution of the 
social costs of the transformation of the state. 
  The UP National Council has not yet decided whether Industry 
Minister Marek Pol, who represents UP in the government, should 
leave the Council of Ministers.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of Center Accord, </F>
by Janina Paradowska and Mariusz Janicki; place and date not 
given: "A Soft System"] 
  [Text] [POLITYKA] You are the author of one of the most 
famous sayings in postcommunist Poland, that the shortest road 
to the de-Christianization of Poland runs through the Christian 
National Union [ZChN]. The Center Accord [PC] itself you built 
up as rather an opposition to the ZChN. Today, the PC and the 
ZChN are the core of a new confederation of the right, the 
Alliance for Poland. How should one treat that alliance: as your 
success, your defeat, or the closing of some chapter? 
  [Kaczynski] Before 19 September [date of most recent 
parliamentary elections], I knew that, without an accord, the 
right would meet defeat. I expected an even better result for 
the left--that it would have two-thirds of the Sejm. Today, I 
regard the alliance with the ZChN as a success, though too late. 
  [POLITYKA] Do you expect a rise in popularity as a result of 
the joining of these two banners? 
  [Kaczynski] It is the joining not only of banners, but also 
of organizations, including at the local level. The Alliance for 
Poland will find its own legal and organizational formula. In 
Poland, it is not possible to register parties that are made up 
of other parties, so we will have to think about this matter. 
  [POLITYKA] But what new political quality will emerge upon 
the joining of too separate groupings that nevertheless retain 
their separateness? 
  [Kaczynski] On the one hand, organizational rapprochement; 
on 
the other, a programmatic compromise as well. There were fierce 
negotiations and occasionally crises over the program, but, in 
the end, we worked out the outline of a program. 
  [POLITYKA] You speak about unification and success, but 
there 
were several divisions before that unification was reached. The 
Movement for the Republic and Aleksander Hall's party 
disassociated, and strong tendencies against the alliance with 
the PC in the ZChN itself. Is such a unification through 
division really a step forward? 
  [Kaczynski] One can look at the right from two points of 
view. One can exaggerate phenomena we consider the scraps, or 
one can look at what is essential. I understand that there are 
forces and groups that are hindered or even threatened by the 
united right. We are simply uniting in a rational way; it is not 
possible, after all, that everyone should unite. 
  [POLITYKA] Do you mean to say, then, that the fundamentalist 
wing within the ZChN, represented by Jan Lopuszanski or Marek 
Jurek, is a meaningless scrap? 
  [Kaczynski] I would not unite the names of Lopuszanski and 
Jurek; they are completely different politicians. I do not 
regard Marek Jurek as a scrap. I hope he stays in the ZChN. The 
essence of the present arguments in that party are not entirely 
clear to me. But the fact that we will differ in many matters 
seems to me completely natural. An example is the Bavarian CSU, 
where there is room for both clerics, or let us say "church 
people," and liberals. To use Polish terms, in such a right-wing 
party there is room for both Marek Jurek and Jan Krzysztof 
Bielecki. Perhaps not for Donald Tusk, because he is surely an 
unreconstructed liberal. 
  [POLITYKA] So you have hope for the right? 
  [Kaczynski] It should stabilize the political order, which 
is 
now so unsteady. There emerges a chance for a quadripartite 
system: the postcommunists, the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], the 
Freedom Union, and the united right. There could also be room 
for the Union of Labor, which might take the place of the 
postcommunists. This is not out of the question. 
  [POLITYKA] You would then be the party furthest to the 
right? 
  [Kaczynski] The furthest of the significant parties, meaning 
those that are capable of gaining at least 15-20 percent of the 
votes in an election--because it is characteristic of Poland 
that 15-20 percent is entirely sufficient to rule the country, 
as shown by the PSL. 
  [POLITYKA] What would a united right have to offer, in the 
sense of a program or idea? Whatever you might say, the Polish 
right calls to mind a kind of Catholic fundamentalism, radical 
decommunization slogans, or just inscrutability. 
  [Kaczynski] You have presented the propaganda version of the 
right--the leftist version. We really have had and do have a 
program in all the important areas of life, but they have not 
drawn the interest of the media, which have only played up the 
decommunization. It is true that these programs must be worked 
on. 
  [POLITYKA] After its unification congress, the Freedom Union 
is often perceived as a right-wing party; clear anticommunist 
accents have appeared, along with signs of reconciliation with 
the church. Please tell us what really makes the Alliance for 
Poland's program different from that of the Freedom Union? 
  [Kaczynski] I am glad that our positions, which at one time 
were roundly condemned, are now adopted by part of the Freedom 
Union. But let us be clear: I am only moderately convinced by 
those declarations. The Union is made up of people who have 
certain resumes, views, and sympathies. I do not really see 
Jacek Kuron, for example, as a liberal conservative, though that 
is how I would describe Bronislaw Komorowski, for example--or 
Bielecki. But many others have views that are liberal, 
socioliberal, or even libertine. I am talking here about values. 
Of course, if the Union moves right, that would be a positive 
process. Every move to the right is desirable because only the 
right can reform Poland. Nothing will change my conviction on 
this. 
  [POLITYKA] Values are one thing, but what else divides the 
Union's "right" from yours? 
  [Kaczynski] Essentially, attitude toward the present social 
and political order is most important. We have demanded and 
continued to demand the fundamental reconstruction of that 
structure, which must include the very painful humbling of some 
groups. 
  [POLITYKA] How do you imagine this might happen, inasmuch as 
you said two years ago that it was already too late for many 
things? 
  [Kaczynski] It is true; some things cannot be reversed. The 
huge sums stolen by the so-called nomenklatura 
corporations can not be recovered. That money has now gone 
through so many owners that it would be impossible to recreate 
the path it has taken. 
  [POLITYKA] There would have to be another theft of that 
which, in your opinion, has already been stolen? 
  [Kaczynski] I would use another term, perhaps: One would 
simply have to call into question in a radical way the certainty 
of law and of business transactions, and that is just not worth 
it. Not that I would have any moral objections to doing that, 
but, for certain reasons, it just is not worth the effort. There 
are, however, moves that can be easily made without threatening 
the system in any way--for example, changing the management of 
state banks. 
  [POLITYKA] Can a one-time change of people restore the 
system's health? 
  [Kaczynski] Yes, because until now the 
nomenklatura has been giving out money to its own 
people. 
  [POLITYKA] You often offer three slogans as a shorthand for 
the program of the PC: Christian values, national traditions, 
and acceptance of the free market economy. I would think that 
millions of Poles would be prepared to declare themselves for 
such a program. Yet the PC has neither millions of members nor, 
what is worse, millions of voters. 
  [Kaczynski] Those are higher goals and values and, thus, 
general; they must be achieved. But today immediate goals are 
also important. One must answer the question of who is to be in 
charge in our country, what the new class of owners should look 
like. This is the essence. We have taken up the struggle with 
the strongest. That we are right is shown by the fact that they 
are trying to destroy us. They have begun a fierce campaign. 
  [POLITYKA] How many members does the Center Accord have 
today? 
  [Kaczynski] Approximately 7,000. 
  [POLITYKA] What, above all, must be done today in Poland? 
  [Kaczynski] The foundations for a change in power must be 
created. One of these foundations is the unification of the 
right. I am not a fan of going out into the streets, of great 
strikes, and of other such revolutionary methods. 
  [POLITYKA] Then what is your position on the latest wave of 
strikes in our country? 
  [Kaczynski] I regard it as a justified reaction to this 
gigantic swindle that took place in Poland before the election. 
The promises of the left could be calculated at some 300 
trillion zlotys, which of course excluded the fulfillment of 
such promises. Actually, it is good that they have not tried to 
fulfill them because that would mean the end of our economy. The 
political order we have today is bad not only because it is 
contrary to our values and views but also because it has a 
confrontational character. The enemy has reappeared, and that 
fosters revolutionary situations. Things were not always as they 
should have been over the previous four years, but there were 
never huge upheavals because that enemy was not there. It is 
true that there were shouts of "thief" during demonstrations 
every week in front of the Office of the Council of Ministers, 
but, despite everything, there was not a confrontation. However, 
for many people who still identify with Solidarity, the present 
government is unacceptable. The strikes that occurred recently 
would not have been possible at all during the so-called 
Solidarity governments. 
  [POLITYKA] It seems as if a miners' strike is scheduled on 
our political calendar more or less twice a year. 
  [Kaczynski] I am not suffering from loss of memory, and I 
remember those strikes, too. But please note that the present 
government went to unheard-of lengths to make concessions, and, 
despite this, the strike continues to smolder. I do not know 
that it can be easily extinguished because we have a new 
situation: a strike when communists are ruling, yet there are no 
repressions like in the old regime. There is no element of fear, 
but there is the element of political confrontation. This is a 
new quality, and the effects of this cannot clearly be seen. 
  [POLITYKA] Do you see a locus for the united right in 
Solidarity? Will you be trying for the union's support? 
  [Kaczynski] Using trade unions--and I'm thinking here of 
Solidarity--for directly political goals is the action of 
politicians who have lost their own political means. There is an 
error in thinking here because Solidarity is internally quite 
varied. What, after all, links Ewa Lewicka from the Mazowsze 
region, who is a supporter of the Union of Labor, to Slawomir 
Siwek, who has always declared himself a right Christian 
Democrat? 
  [POLITYKA] So Solidarity does not interest the right as a 
partner? 
  [Kaczynski] I repeat: We do not support the direct use of 
the 
union. Nonetheless, we count on rational thinking winning out in 
Solidarity and the union placing its support with those 
political forces that are really able to change Poland within 
the limits of economic reason. 
  [POLITYKA] What scenario do you envision for the unified 
right? 
  [Kaczynski] A deepening of internal integration and the 
building of a common program. And also political activity, which 
will be particularly evident this fall. 
  [POLITYKA] Will the local government elections be a test for 
the new right, or don't you treat them that way? 
  [Kaczynski] In a direct sense no, because we have entered 
various coalitions in different localities--including with the 
Freedom Union. We want to hold back the ruling coalition in 
order to lessen the dimensions of its victory. This will be 
difficult because the countryside is dominated, without 
exaggeration, by a PSL political monoculture. The structures of 
the United Peasant Party were not dissolved when the time was 
right, and now we have the result of this. 
  [POLITYKA] In an interview for GAZETA WYBORCZA after the 
election, you spoke about the need to rethink, reevaluate 
attitudes toward the Alliance of the Democratic Left [SLD], 
which is an enduring element of the Polish political scene. 
There is no evidence of such rethinking and reevaluation in what 
you say. The rhetoric has changed, but the essence has remained 
the same. 
  [Kaczynski] I have reevaluated. At first I assessed their 
political qualifications higher, and now I consider them to be 
close to zero. To win the election and have really almost no 
power--that is almost impossible to imagine. Walesa took some of 
the power, Pawlak took the rest, and Kwasniewski managed to 
believe in what the press wrote about some kind of super prime 
ministership. He completely forgot that institutional positions 
and not a series of awards or titles are important. The SLD is 
like officers who look good on the parade ground but do not 
count for much when it comes to a real battle. This, of course, 
creates the hope that the results of the last election will not 
be repeated. And, besides the tactical defeat, there are the 
policies they pursue, which I consider to be destructive. 
  [POLITYKA] You said that they do not have power, so how 
could 
they conduct a destructive policy? 
  [Kaczynski] Well, they are not overthrowing the government; 
they are not leaving the coalition. They thus give permission 
for that policy. This does not encourage one to see them as 
someone who might in the future be a lasting partner in a 
general political endeavor. 
  [POLITYKA] You envision, therefore, an unending 
confrontation, along the lines of: In one election they do us 
in, and in the next we do them in. And once again we will 
reckon, decommunize, lustrate. This method of acting does not 
seem to enjoy much popularity in public opinion. 
  [Kaczynski] If we were to win the election by ourselves, 
which does not seem to be in the cards, someone who was in the 
security apparatus could with certainty count on only the lowest 
pension. In addition, he would have to thank us because even 
more drastic methods would be considered just. But, because we 
live in soft times, those lowest pensions would have to do. As 
far as immediate public opinion is concerned... 
  [POLITYKA] ...not only: the election verdict as well. 
  [Kaczynski] Public opinion is changeable. I assure you that 
if, in 1989, the PRL [Polish People's Republic] was clearly 
separated from the new era and decommunization had been 
conducted with a series of trials, that opinion would be 
radically different. 
  [POLITYKA] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Professor Michal Kulesza, former government </F>
official, by correspondent Tomasz Zajac; place and date not 
given] 
  [Text] We keep hearing comments about the growing role of 
local self-government in the political life of the country. 
However, is it not that we entertain happy illusions about it, 
while the central authorities are determined not to give away 
their power to the so-called lower reaches--that is, local 
self-government bodies? 
  [Kulesza] It is precisely as you suggest. The central 
authorities are very attached to their positions, and this is 
not a phenomenon that suddenly developed after 19 September 
[1993--parliamentary election]. The conservative nature of 
political structures is a general feature in world politics. 
Centralism is a common disease of politicians, although, in the 
West, for example, a decentralization campaign was launched as a 
conscious and deliberate decision many years ago. 
  [Zajac] Do you not believe that the handing down of power is 
impeded by the fear and traditionalist mentality of the 
politicians at the top, whereas, if we consider it objectively, 
they would actually be able to get rid of the responsibility for 
many problems? 
  [Kulesza] Handing over a certain proportion of their 
responsibilities would be more advantageous to them in objective 
terms, but it would not be as simple as all that. When you try 
to jump onto a moving streetcar, there is a moment at which you 
are no longer running but are not yet riding the streetcar. This 
situation is something we can quite realistically fear. All of 
the noncommunist governments we had since 19 September were 
doing something--well or less well, wisely or not very--to 
promote the cause of a reform of the central administration 
system, which aimed, among other things, at a decentralization 
of power. We even arrived at a stage, during the Suchocka 
government, where everything was already prepared for a reform, 
and the only thing needed was to simply launch it. It so 
happened that I was at that time responsible for the 
administrative reform, and I remember clearly that there was 
also a very obvious public need and desire for such a change. 
The following may be an extreme example, but people really did 
offer church services for the success of the new districts 
scheme. So what happened instead? We now have the very first 
government that commands an unquestionable majority in 
parliament but has absolutely no political willpower to reform 
the administration system. The conditions and opportunities are 
there, but there is no will to carry out the reform. 
  [Zajac] The price of the reform is another subject of public 
debate. Critics claim that the new districts will simply be too 
expensive. 
  [Kulesza] I disagree. The cost of the administrative reform 
will come to approximately half a trillion zlotys [Z]. An 
election costs as much, to reach for a topical example. The 
costs of relinquishing the plans for the reform will be much 
higher. 
  [Zajac] How would you answer the argument that, in fact, a 
reform that reinforces self-government structures and hands over 
power to "lower," local structures is needed by politically 
bankrupt politicians rather than by our society? 
  [Kulesza] Such an objection is simply stupid. I will answer 
it with a simple example: If you are buying a car of a 
particular make, you are not interested in its finer 
construction details because that is a job for the engineering 
designer. Similarly, the design and implementation of local 
self-government reforms are jobs for politicians. You simply 
want to drive your new car in comfort, while society wants to 
see efficient and effective administration, competent police, 
and good hospitals and schools--that is, everything that can be 
designed and executed by the "political engineers." 
  [Zajac] Does this mean that politicians know better what 
the public wants? 
  [Kulesza] Politicians must know better because that is what 
they are elected for. They are responsible for setting up all 
of the mechanisms in the state so that these work well and are 
of benefit to the public. 
  [Zajac] How should this local self-government "automobile" 
look? 
  [Kulesza] Local communities should assume control of 
everything that is required to meet the collective needs of the 
local population--for example, education (primary as well as 
secondary), health care and social services, the police, the 
fire-fighting forces, culture and the arts, and so on. At the 
same time, we must remember that we cannot hand over power and 
responsibility without money. 
  [Zajac] Let us move from theory to practical considerations. 
Our own backyard in the tri-city [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot] 
conurbation surely provides an interesting example of local 
self-government run actively by the local community, with all of 
the advantages and drawbacks that this entails. 
  [Kulesza] The tri-city is in a rather fortunate situation. 
The conurbation, whose size equals other major cities in Poland, 
is divided into three sectors, each with its own self-government 
bodies. This is all working well, even as the decentralization 
reform in Warsaw, which is devised along the same lines, is 
encountering very considerable resistance. 
  [Zajac] To conclude, let us attempt a recapitulation of the 
situation. Although, admittedly, the administrative reform and 
the associated "handing down" of power to local structures has 
been halted, the last word in the reform process has not been 
said yet. Are you an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to 
assessing the future of that process? 
  [Kulesza] That depends on how the three parties 
involved--that is, the Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish 
Peasant Party, and the Union of Freedom--act now. However, it 
is difficult to ward off pessimistic reflections about the 
future of the reform. 
  [Zajac] Thank you for talking with us.

  [Text] Warsaw, 27 Jun--According to Grzegorz Kolodko, 
deputy prime minister and finance minister, cooperation with the 
World Bank "Will be even better than it has been so far." 
Kolodko said this to journalists after meeting today with 
Wilfried Thalwitz, World Bank vice president (Europe and 
Central Asia Regional Office). 
  The bank supports the "Strategy for Poland" program, as well 
as new, joint projects, which will be financed from the bank's 
resources. They are connected with the development of 
infrastructure, a restructuring of the power industry and the 
welfare system, and development of the transport network. "Today 
we talked about the money, which is big," Kolodko said. 
  Most of the World Bank funds are used, but we have some 
problems with utilizing some of these funds--for example, in the 
housing industry. The aim of the talks is to find the best 
solutions so that the World Bank can join in the implementation 
of tasks resulting from the Strategy for Poland program.

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, president of the </F>
National Bank of Poland, by Zbigniew Maciag; place and date not 
given: "Consolidation and Privatization"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Maciag] Don't you think 
the new leadership of the Finance Ministry attaches greater 
importance to the consolidation of the banking sector than to 
its privatization? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think that all Polish banks should be 
both consolidated and privatized. Both these processes are 
truly necessary. Our banks, even the state-owned ones, are only 
small financial institutions compared to the big European banks. 
  [Maciag] Is it easier to privatize or to consolidate? Which 
should come first? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] If one wants to create one big bank out 
of several smaller banks, then indeed consolidation is more 
advantageous. Then, when individual banks are on the stock 
market, any mergers among them are less likely. For the time 
being, the role of the giant, but only on the domestic market, 
is played by Bank Handlowy. Other banks are much smaller. I 
believe that it would be good if several banks with really 
strong capital reserves were established. For me, as president 
of the National Bank of Poland [NBP], it does not make any 
difference whether I supervise the activity of one bank or the 
activities of several banks. The important thing is that they 
are in good financial condition. I am more interested in the 
problems of small privately owned banks, threatened with 
bankruptcy, than the problems of state-owned banks, whose 
functioning is supervised by the owner--that is, by the Finance 
Ministry. 
  [Maciag] The authors of "Strategy for Poland" stress that 
ownership transformations in the banking sector will be 
perceived by the government as an instrument that enables 
efficient allocation of resources. In this context, the choice 
between the form of ownership and efficiency, if such a choice 
emerges, will be a foregone conclusion: Efficiency will be 
chosen. Such an approach may mean that it is not worth 
privatizing any more state-owned banks because right now their 
efficiency indexes are much better than those of privately owned 
banks. What do you think of it? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the long run, the condition of 
state-owned banks will deteriorate. The experiences of other 
countries, such as Italy, Austria, and France, show that these 
banks achieve definitely poorer financial results than their 
privately owned competitors. For the time being, state-owned 
banks are characterized by a lower cost of obtaining money. If 
we take into account the huge turnover and the large number of 
accounts, this is perfectly understandable. The costs of 
obtaining money in privately owned banks are incomparably 
higher. These banks must attract customers with higher interest 
rates of deposits, which costs money. However, in a few years' 
time, state-owned banks would be bound to achieve poorer results 
than privately owned ones. Such phenomena have been observed to 
take place in many market economy states. The correct 
conclusions must be drawn from these experiences. 
  [Maciag] The first version of "Strategy for Poland" included 
the suggestion that banking supervision should no longer be 
exercised by the NBP. The suggestion was later removed. Did it 
happen at your request? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it did. There is no reason that 
this supervision should function outside the NBP. Of the 12 
states in the European Union [EU], only in four of them is 
supervision exercised outside the central bank; however, this is 
only to a certain degree because, in France, supervision is 
exercised by a special banking commission; its head is the 
president of the central bank of this country and his inspectors 
are the employees. [passage omitted] 
  [Maciag] The economic program presented by Deputy Prime 
Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is critical of the activity of the 
NBP. It accuses the bank of combining the functions of issuing, 
supervisory functions, and ownership functions, which is not 
conducive to the proper fulfillment of any of them. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I do not agree with this thesis; it is 
not really tenable. If we take into account the financial 
policy, it is the central bank that forces the government to 
limit the budget deficit, inflation. The fact that the members 
of the supervision team presented deputies with a good diagnosis 
of the situation in the banking sectors proves that they stopped 
pretending that nothing is happening to it. 
  But, if the state budget is willing to take over banks 
being supervised by the NBP--for instance, Prosper Bank or 
Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin--I will gladly give them up. 
The NBP does not have to perform the ownership function. I 
have suggested many times in the past to the finance minister 
that state-owned banks, of which he is the owner, should take 
over trouble-stricken privately owned banks. 
  [Maciag] Was the NBP consulted over that part of the 
"Strategy for Poland" program that pertains to reforming the 
banking sector? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, it was not. Apparently, one of our 
departments is said to have been contacted, but there was 
neither any team formed nor was there an exchange of official 
letters on the topic. I received the final draft of the program 
right before a session of the Council of Ministers, and I was 
asked to take a position on it. 
  [Maciag] The program's authors announced a gradual reduction 
in the rate of mandatory reserves. When can the central bank 
make the first step in that direction? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must wait for economic figures from 
the first six months of the year. The inflation level compared 
with the forecast for the end of 1994 will have a decisive 
impact. If inflation is low, we will think whether to decrease 
mandatory reserves and whether to keep reducing interest rates. 
For the time being, we are not planning on making such 
decisions. Still, the trend is correct: Along with falling 
inflation, there should occur a decrease in mandatory reserves 
and interest rates. 
  [Maciag] Is it realistic to expect inflation to fall below 
10 percent by 1997? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Achieving a singe-digit inflation figure 
within three years is possible, but it will require tremendous 
financial discipline. First of all, one must control salaries 
in the state-owned sector very tightly, regardless of whether we 
decide to adopt the British or the French model. We cannot 
allow for an increase in the budget deficit. On the contrary, 
one must strive to limit its size. That is because a high 
budget deficit limits the possibilities of financing 
investments. The central bank's role in financing the budget 
deficit cannot be significant because that would cause an 
increase in inflation. Personally, I think we will manage to 
decrease inflation to below 10 percent, but not before 1998. I 
presented such a forecast at a meeting of EU representatives in 
Brussels. At the meeting, West European experts stated that, 
according to their calculations, we will achieve a single-digit 
inflation figure in 1998. 
  [Maciag] Banks have been devoting too much money for 
financing the budget deficit. What should one do to increase 
the number of credits for the economy and for individual 
enterprises over the next few years? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From the standpoint of monetary 
policies, credit measures by banks are perhaps insufficient. 
But, in our country, there is the habit of treating credits as 
something that is given away and that people deserve to get. 
That is wrong. If there are good projects, banks will finance 
them. Decreased inflation is bound to decrease the 
profitability of investing in Treasury bills, and, thus, it will 
increase the interest banks charge on credits. 
  [Maciag] For the moment, however, banks prefer to make money 
on security transactions rather than on providing credits. 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By purchasing Treasury bills, banks take 
a smaller risk. We are not the only country with a budget 
deficit. The Treasury bills market is developed in many 
countries with market economies. Naturally, it is 
competition--banks prefer to buy secure, state-owned securities 
rather then financing risky ventures. That is why a persistent 
reduction of the budget deficit is necessary. 
  [Maciag] How should one encourage the Polish people to save 
money? Is it possible to have a slower rate of falling interest 
rates on deposits compared with the rate falling interest rates 
on credits? 
  [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Banks make their living by price 
margins. We cannot expect them to deliberately decrease their 
profits. In my view, the Polish zloty should be continuously 
overvalued, if I may say so. That means that 
creeping devaluation should be lower than inflation. Then we 
will make sure that it will be profitable to save in zlotys. 
The central bank has been trying to conduct such a policy. 
Last year, it was profitable to have zloty deposits in banks, 
even though not as much as we initially planned. We had to 
devalue the national currency because of the deepening payment 
deficit. This year, we will do everything not to allow those 
who have deposited money in Polish banks to suffer losses.

  [Text] In the first part of a news conference by 
Presidential Spokesman Ambassador Traian Chebeleu today, he 
assessed Czech President Vaclav Havel's visit to Bucharest, 
which he described as a special event in the development of 
international relations between the two countries. 
  Ambassador Traian Chebeleu went on to read a statement on 
the 
so-called invitation to Romania's president from representatives 
of certain political parties, in which the president is to be 
summoned before Parliament. 
  After reasserting that the president will appear before 
Parliament as often as necessary but solely according to 
procedures stipulated by the Constitution, Chebeleu said that 
President Ion Iliescu had initiated actions for new 
consultations with the leaders of the parliamentary parties. 
Currently, presidential advisers are engaged in negotiations 
with the leaders of certain political parties to establish a 
convenient time for the resumption of the head of state's talks 
with the parties. 
  The spokesman also told the journalists that Romanian 
Foreign 
Minister Teodor Melescanu, who is currently on a visit to 
Poland, conveyed a message from President Ion Iliescu to Polish 
President Lech Walesa. In this the head of the Romanian state 
accepts an invitation to visit Poland, noting that there is a 
good chance that this visit will take place this year. 
  To a journalist's question, Chebeleu replied that the 
parliamentary strike initiated by the Democratic Convention of 
Romania represents the members of Parliament's abandonment of 
their responsibilities toward the electorate and a 
generalization of a method that has already been used by some 
parliamentary groups, namely to leave the hall when certain laws 
are being passed. 
  Referring to the events in Cluj-Napoca, generated by the 
archaeological diggings in the area where the statue of Matthias 
Corvinus is situated, the spokesman said that President Iliescu 
had suggested to the Cluj mayor that he organize discussions 
with all the local factors, thus avoiding any escalation of 
tension in the region, which is viewed by Chebeleu as being 
artificial. He also added that lately an excessive 
politicization of certain gestures and actions could be observed 
and expressed his belief that the situation in Cluj could be 
solved calmly, after listening to all the sides involved in the 
dispute, our correspondents informed us.

[Steps] TV program. Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik pointed out 
that the functioning of a parliamentary democracy requires a 
stable structure of political parties, which is an important 
prerequisite for political stability. According to him, the 
coming elections can also play an important role from the point 
of view of sharpening the profile of the political scene. Jozef 
Moravcik stated that the Left is forming well and that the Right 
of the political spectrum is also clear. However, he said that 
the situation is difficult in the center, where a rather 
complicated development can yet be expected. 
  Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia, described the coalition government as a broad-based 
experiment that cannot be maintained over the longer term. He 
said of Jozef Moravcik's Cabinet that it is heading for economic 
ruin in going back to a given macroeconomic policy, that it is 
incompetent in the financial sphere, and that it is coping badly 
with privatization.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Karel Kriz: "Socialism Even Without Meciar"] </F>
  [Text] Almost one and a half years have gone by since the 
breakup of the federation, and Slovakia still cannot show a 
single economic indicator that has improved. Precisely the other 
way around. The past as well as the present government--after 
all, they both share credit for the independent state--are thus 
faced with a basic problem: how to explain to themselves as well 
as to the nation the escalating bankruptcy. And how to achieve 
the promised growth. 
  After the Moravcik government was installed, it may have 
appeared for a while, especially under the influence of Rudolf 
Filkus's statement, that the new Cabinet will respond with a 
solution conforming to market conditions: appreciable 
devaluation that would slow down imports and at the same time 
promote export and economic growth. But a different tendency 
prevailed: Meciar's rate of exchange from the beginning of the 
year was affirmed in the end, and the Slovak economy is 
therefore gradually barricading itself from the world. The 
introduction of quality certificates--meaning, administrative 
barriers to imports--are merely one of the manifestations of 
this tendency. 
  To tell the truth, the communist influx into the economic 
departments could hardly have led to anything else in 
Bratislava: Weiss's people took the office of deputy prime 
minister for economy (B. Schmognerova), as well as the Ministry 
of Economy (P. Magasi) and the Ministry of Agriculture (P. 
Koncos). In this configuration, there is nothing left to liberal 
Filkus but to try and find the money to cover the budget 
deficits. 
  No matter how specific the position of the new Slovak 
Government is, one thing is certain: On the banks of the Danube, 
they began once again to "manage" the economy; they placed their 
subjective rationality above the objective rationality of the 
market. According to this approach, the customs union is good 
when it suits, and vice versa. In the future, not customers but 
officials will make decisions about imports: One barrier after 
another will go up, exactly the way the Slovak producers will 
pressure their officials to do it--or even pay them for doing it. 
  But let us leave the consequences of this policy--that is, 
increasing prices and declining competitiveness--to the Slovaks 
themselves. The dilemma of our government is this: keep the 
customs union or rescind it? And, if so, when? The complexity of 
the answer stems from the fact--and the Slovaks are taking 
advantage of it--that we will necessarily also pay for the 
dissolution of the common economic zone, although substantially 
less than Bratislava itself. The macroeconomic view advises (for 
the time being) us to grit our teeth. But what will the specific 
Czech producer say about it, who cannot sell on the Slovak 
market, while, at the same time, the way in the opposite 
direction is open? 
  Making concessions never leads anywhere, it seems to me.

  [Text] Speaking in the U.S. Senate in connection with a 
debate on lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ejup 
Ganic, vice president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, said 
inter alia that the arms embargo against the legitimate and 
recognized Government of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Republic was the 
policy aimed at the therapy that the international community has 
been employing in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the past two years in 
response to the aggression. This therapy has led to a 
catastrophe in my country. The therapy failed simply because 
the patient is dying and it must be changed. 
  Repression and genocide against the non-Serb population are 
part of the program of creating a greater Serbia on the basis of 
the idea of ethnic cleansing. Unfortunately, 50 years later, 
Europe is again witnessing the expansion of fascism. We are 
asking you to lift the embargo so that we can exclusively defend 
ourselves and ensure a lasting peace. We have not lost the war. 
The Serbs have tried to destroy our country and us with all 
available means, but they have not yet succeeded in this. 
  Our people are capable and knowledgeable, and with their 
bare 
hands they are still resisting and keeping our main towns and 
vital industrial zones under their control. We are asking you 
to lift the embargo to create conditions for peace and for talks 
through balance in arms. We need arms in order to survive and 
not in order to win, because our losses and the genocide we 
suffered prevent us from speaking about victory. 
  For this reason we say it again and again: We are not asking 
your troops to fight for us on the ground, this is our task, but 
we are begging you not to use big words that translate into 
small actions.

  [Text] Skopje, 25 Jun (TANJUG) -- Macedonian President Kiro 
Gligorov received Lord David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, 
cochairmen of the Geneva conference on former Yugoslavia, at 
their request in Skopje this morning, an announcement from the 
president's office says. 
  The talks focused on several issues of relevance to the 
situation in the region of former Yugoslavia and the 
international mediators' mission. These issues were also 
discussed at the European Union summit in Corfu, from where Lord 
Owen and Stoltenberg have just arrived. 
  TANJUG has learned that Gligorov and the two cochairmen also 
discussed the dire economic situation in The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] caused by the economic sanctions 
against the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia], Greece's trade 
embargo, and the situation in the border area between the FYROM 
and the FRY.

  [Text] Skopje, 25 June (TANJUG) -- "We mentioned the 
problem of Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] northern border with Serbia during the Corfu 
talks. We decided to discuss this issue in detail and, if 
possible, to resolve it appropriately," said Lord Owen, 
cochairman of the conference on former Yugoslavia, today during 
his brief meeting with the press in Skopje. 
  According to Owen, the European Union "is striving to 
prevent 
another war, in addition the Bosnian one, and that is the 
Serb-Croat war, which was one of the main items on the Corfu 
summit agenda, besides the situation in Ukraine." 
  Owen said that Macedonia was discussed at the summit in 
connection with the cochairmen's and international envoys' 
efforts to organize direct negotiations with Greece and that 
Macedonia needs aid, economic aid in particular. "All of us 
involved in the negotiating process will support this," Lord 
Owen said.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Dudek: "The Uncertainties of U.S. </F>
Foreign Policy"] 
  [Text] U.S. foreign policy decisions concerning the 
politically stable European countries (including the Czech 
Republic) are made at the so-called lower government level. The 
decisions unfold in the "iron triangle": the Department of 
Department--special-interest groups--Congress. 
  Every change of personnel among the leading officials in a 
U.S. department is, therefore, a change worthy of note. Among 
the most recent and most surprising changes is the resignation, 
announced last week, of Assistant Secretary for European Affairs 
Stephen Oxman. 
  "The erroneous impression is often formed in Europe that 
U.S. 
foreign policy is purely a matter for the president," said 
Andrew Steigman, a political scientist and veteran of U.S. 
diplomacy, in Prague yesterday. "Nothing is further from the 
truth," pointed out the former diplomat. 
  The news of Oxman's resignation also attracted attention 
because it was announced at the same time that Jennone Walker, a 
specialist on Europe, is to leave the National Security 
Committee in the White House. They will both be replaced by 
experienced diplomats. Richard Holbrooke, until now ambassador 
in Germany, is to replace Oxman, and Alexander Vershbow is to go 
into the White House in place of Walker. 
  It is of interest to the Czech Republic that Jennone Walker 
has been offered the post of ambassador to Prague. Walker, 
whose appointment has still to be confirmed by the Senate, has 
so far not denied this report. It is supported by at least one 
Prague diplomatic source. If no problems crop up--and none are 
envisaged--Walker should take over at the Prague embassy at the 
beginning of next summer. This will hardly be to the general 
delight of current Ambassador Adrian Basora. 
  Why are Oxman and Walker going? According to Washington 
sources, definitely not because serious professional 
shortcomings could be attributed to them. The reason is more 
likely to be an attempt by Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
and President Clinton's security adviser (that is, the head of 
the National Security Council), Anthony Lake, to take the edge 
off the criticism that for an embarrassingly long time and 
uncomfortably emphatically has been descending on them. 
  Christopher and Lake are apparently guilty of not having 
managed to "instill sufficient confidence both at home and 
abroad." The resignations of Oxman and Walker should presumably 
act as a palliative for the weak reputation of the government 
team entrusted with foreign policy. 
  Of course, in this connection, there is also speculation 
about whether the changes could go even further. Until now, 
Stephen Oxman was considered in Washington to be a man in an 
"unshakable" position because he is a close friend of President 
Clinton and has been since they were students together, and also 
of Secretary Christopher, with whom he worked in Jimmy Carter's 
administration. 
  If Oxman is resigning now, could Warren Christopher or 
Anthony Lake be next? This is not out of the question in the 
case of the somewhat colorless presidential adviser Lake. This 
probably does not apply in the case of the seasoned Secretary of 
State Christopher--at least, until the fall congressional 
elections.

<F P=106> [Interview with Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel by </F>
Maksim Bekhar in Prague; date not given: "They Told Me in 1968: 
`You Must Become President'"] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Bekhar] You will be 
visiting Sofia for only a few hours. This could be interpreted 
as underestimating Bulgaria, a country with which the Czech 
Republic has very close relations. 
  [Havel] President Zhelev has already visited here, and I 
visited Sofia in the days of Czechoslovakia. We were not able 
to accomplish everything we had hoped to, despite the fact that 
President Zhelev and I have known each other since our days as 
dissidents. My brief visit is not meant to underestimate 
Bulgaria--precisely the opposite. Because I will be visiting 
Romania, a country where I have never been, I said to myself 
that I cannot be so close to Sofia and not stop over for a while 
to meet with President Zhelev again. In addition, there is a 
relatively substantial Czech community in Bulgaria, and a very 
strong Czech-Slovak club has been active there for many years. 
I am really very sorry because I always say that I am going to 
find time for my compatriots in your country, and I never could 
until now. 
  [Bekhar] Is this the only thing bringing you to Bulgaria? 
  [Havel] We are two countries that, willingly or unwillingly, 
have many common concerns. We did away with communism at about 
the same time, and now we are struggling with its consequences. 
You and we alike want to construct a real democracy and join 
the European structures. Both you and we have no guarantees 
that one day we will not make any mistakes. Therefore, the more 
frequently we exchange experiences and talk to each other, the 
greater our chances will be to eliminate the shadow of communism 
as soon as possible. 
  [Bekhar] Experience also used to be exchanged in the 
past.... 
  [Havel] Oh my God, you know I mean something else. In the 
past, we had a strange, imposed friendship, in which everything 
was clear and precise. Afterwards, when CEMA and the Warsaw 
Pact collapsed like a house of cards and it became clear that 
this entire market was an artificial creation, it appeared that 
we would have to construct something new. 
  [Bekhar] And what is that? 
  [Havel] I can tell you in one word: democracy. 
  [Bekhar] This is clear, but you know that the love for 
democracy passes through the stomach. Therefore, don't you 
think we could help each other a lot more if there were a free 
and custom-free market between Bulgaria and the Czech Republic? 
There are traditions in this sphere.... 
  [Havel] The Czech Republic, in principle, adheres to the 
maximal liberalizing of trade. I plan to discuss this subject 
in Romania, and, obviously, we will talk about this in Bulgaria, 
but everything requires time. A group of experts is studying 
whether it is possible to intensify trade between our countries. 
By the way, the same applies to Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. 
  [Bekhar] All this could be a lot simpler if Bulgaria were a 
member of the Visegrad Four. Will you support Bulgaria's 
admission into this group? 
  [Havel] It is not that simple. [passage omitted] 
  [Bekhar] Then you think that no state has the chance of 
joining this alliance, regardless of its goals and structure? 
  [Havel] I think that expanding the group now is pointless. 
Personally, I support small regional communities. This is the 
case of the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, and now the 
Visegrad Four. However, this does not mean that we consider 
ourselves superior to the Balkan states. It is just that you 
are in the south and we are in Central Europe. This hardly 
gives us any advantage, but it nevertheless remains a historical 
and geographical fact. The small communities can always react 
rapidly and practically. In addition, they have common 
interests and could protect them more successfully. 
  [Bekhar] Do you think we should create a Balkan federation? 
  [Havel] God forbid! I do not want to give any advice. At 
least I have not been authorized to do so. Actually, why should 
you not create such an entity? A new organization would emerge, 
and, as was the case was with the Visegrad Four, everyone will 
want to join. This is, to a certain degree, characteristic of 
our time. We are all nervous and are watching each other to see 
that no one gains an advantage over the rest by integrating with 
someone else. Everyone wants to join every possible 
organization, which is impossible. You have so many common 
interests with Greece and Romania. It makes no difference 
whether it is a postcommunist state or not. Greece is a member 
of both NATO and the European Union. It could be very useful as 
a member of a Balkan community or alliance; it makes no 
difference what it is going to be called. If one day the 
nightmare in Yugoslavia is over, perhaps some of its former 
republics will also join. Albania also is doing whatever it can 
in order to become a democratic state. You and Turkey belong to 
the Black Sea Cooperation Zone. The Czech Republic is not a 
member of this organization. It has no business there.... 
[passage omitted] 
  [Bekhar] The former communists in Eastern Europe began to 
return in a rather triumphant manner. This time they are armed 
with rightist economic programs. Are you not afraid that the 
same could happen in the Czech Republic? 
  [Havel] For several reasons, I think it would be impossible. 
First, Prague used to have the most conservative communists 
among the Warsaw Pact countries. That regime was so rotten and 
compromised that I do not envy its heirs. This is why they 
quarrel so much among themselves. In addition, there is no 
serious leftist force in the Czech Republic that proposes 
anything serious. The leftist forces that exist in Slovakia, 
Poland, and Hungary simply do not exist in the Czech Republic. 
There is a rather hard-core communist party, whose members are 
those who do not want to part with the illusions of their life. 
In addition, there are two smaller communist parties, with 
which it is possible to conduct a discussion of sorts, but they 
do not represent any electoral force or threat to anyone. 
Finally, there is another factor: The most capable and smart 
communists in the Czech Republic long ago became capitalists and 
vote for the most rightist parties simply because, for them, 
capitalism is better than communism.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Vaclav Havel by Eva Hulkova at </F>
Lany presidential residence, date not given: "Conversations at 
Lany"--live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Hulkova] Mr. President, this week you visited 
Romania and Bulgaria. I would be interested in hearing your 
view of the prospects in our mutual relations. 
  [Havel] Romania and Bulgaria are two European states with a 
rich and interesting history. These two states have the same 
importance as any other state of that region. In a few years' 
time, these two states could reach a level comparable to that of 
Greece or any other state that has not experienced a period of 
communism. These two states are following a complicated path of 
tackling the consequences of communism, as are we. In many 
aspects, we are ahead of them. They are well aware of this and 
are look upon us with almost uncritical respect. However, at 
the same time, I think that any belittling attitude towards 
these countries is misplaced. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] It is clear that behind any trip of a high 
official 
there is a question asked by the citizens of our country: What 
are we going gain from it? This is what matters. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Havel] The Balkans are also part of Europe. I have 
gradually visited all European countries, or almost all of them. 
This has been a part of my long-term plan, through which I am 
realizing the idea of returning to Europe, becoming a part of 
Europe. 
  We must not think that Europe is only Brussels. Europe also 
includes Romania, Europe also includes Bulgaria. We want to 
have good relations with all European states, both political and 
economic relations. [passage omitted] Europe does not consist of 
only the member states of the European Union. 
  [Hulkova] I think it was after your talks with the Bulgarian 
president that you spoke in favor of cooperation and closer 
contacts but not in favor of doing so under an umbrella of 
institutions because this would simply lead to a further 
division of Europe rather than its unification. How was this 
idea received? 
  [Havel] We agreed on it with President Zhelev. I think this 
view has begun to prevail in our countries. I have discussed 
this with many officials from various countries. All of us have 
begun to feel that turning the alliance and community spirit of 
the former communist countries into institutions incorporates 
the danger of some sort of new division. There are people in 
the West for whom this would make life easier because it is 
simpler for them to deal with us as if we were some sort of 
alternative bloc, a counterpart, a partner, as they dealt for 
decades with the Warsaw Pact or CEMA. This is, of course, 
simpler than to perceive every single country as an individual 
country, as a legitimate democratic country that strives to 
become a legitimate part of the European democratic structures. 
  This is why I perceive as dangerous all those hints, 
emerging 
now and then, coming above all from the West, expressing their 
preference to see us all in one bag and to deal in a certain 
manner with that one bag. However, this is not advantageous for 
us. [passage omitted] 
  [Hulkova] It is obviously in the greatest interest of the 
West to have good relations with Russia; therefore, I would like 
to hear your comment from this point of view on the signing by 
Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev of the Partnership for Peace, 
especially as this has consequences even for us. Can we be less 
fearful of their enormous armed might and strength? 
  [Havel] I thought from the beginning and also had 
discussions 
to this effect when I met President Clinton here concerning 
Partnership for Peace, that there must be some kind of 
partnership-based relations between the North Atlantic alliance 
and Russia. I felt that there must be good relations, which is 
in the interest of Europe and the world. That relationship will 
always be in a certain manner specific because Russia is a large 
Eurasian nuclear power that is surrounded by its own security 
system, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and that is in 
an entirely different position from a small Central European 
country like ours. 
  Whether Partnership for Peace should be a starting point for 
good relations between the alliance and Russia I was not sure. I 
was more inclined toward the view that it should, that 
Partnership for Peace was such an open program that made 
possible so many different means of implementation that it could 
indeed be the starting point for that necessary good 
relationship with Russia. Now, of course, it also depends on the 
content with which it is implemented. I cannot imagine that it 
could be implemented with the same content as is desired by us 
for the Partnership for Peace program. For us, it is the first 
stage toward legitimate, full membership in the alliance. I 
cannot imagine Russia as part of the North Atlantic alliance. 
That is an almost nonsensical notion, is it not? However, 
friendship and good cooperation between the alliance and Russia 
are unavoidable. 
  What is most significant about the Russian signing is the 
fact that it is not linked to any special position in the sense 
that Russia could advise the alliance as to who it may or may 
not accept as a member, how it may or may not expand, that it 
could have some kind of veto, that it could have a privileged 
position in this respect on account of its being more powerful. 
I think attempts were presumably made to link the signing of 
Partnership for Peace to this kind of specific position, and, 
fortunately, they did not succeed. 
  [Hulkova] This is exactly what I wanted to ask as regards 
the 
right of veto. I would like to know what is, in your view, the 
meaning of the fact that the alliance has resisted this pressure 
and that this idea has been put forward by Russia? 
  [Havel] The fact that it was voiced by Russia probably 
reflects Russia's internal political situation. Russia is a 
country going through a shock following the loss of superpower 
status, following the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the 
loss of its former satellites. Moreover, this is a country 
where pushing through economic reforms is incomparably more 
difficult than in our country. Its citizens are suffering much 
more. It is a country without great democratic traditions; 
there are social, national, and other tensions there. The loss 
of superpower status is, of course, felt painfully there, and 
this is to a certain extent reflected in certain tones present 
in their foreign policy, which seems to be attempting to calm 
society with impressions of some kind of special status. 
  This is also linked to the traditional Russian distrust of 
others, above all those to the west of them. They fear the 
alliance expanding eastward, as though an enemy were 
approaching. They must understand that the eastward expansion 
of the alliance means extending the zone of democracy, freedom, 
peace, and civic principles and that this is nothing to threaten 
Russia, that, on the contrary, this is something that, by means 
of radiation, could help Russia. I consider it good that the 
West has managed to defend this idea that we, the former Soviet 
satellites, kept repeating--I wrote various articles on this, 
published in the United States and elsewhere--that it has 
managed to defend this fundamental position against Russian 
attempts to win some special status. This is a sign of a 
certain faithfulness to one's own principles and to the 
principles on which the community is based. 
  [Hulkova] With regard to developments on the domestic 
political scene, undoubtedly the most important and certainly 
the most interesting point was the fact that this week the 
government did not approve Kalvoda's concept of higher 
territorial and administrative units. What is your view? 
  [Havel] Because I anticipated this question, I prepared a 
note. Allow me to read it out to you. 
  It is obvious that democracy cannot be limited only to the 
state level and that most of the decisionmaking process should 
be transferred directly to the citizens. 
  That is why the reform of state administration and its 
decentralization will be the paramount task of the government in 
this sphere in the coming period. These two points are a 
condition of the success of economic transformation and of the 
functioning of a free civic society. The government will make 
sure that regional and local self-administration is implemented 
in the area it will specify to a greater degree than has been 
the case so far. The territorial setup of the state will 
correspond to the basic requirement of democracy, which 
constitutes the transfer of decisionmaking powers and 
responsibility as close as possible to the citizen. This 
territorial setup will be based on self-administered 
communities, natural regions or possibly historical territorial 
units equipped with relevant powers and funds, which will lower 
their dependence on the Republic's budget and will enhance the 
citizen's coresponsibility for the development of the community 
in which he lives. 
  We want our society to be a civic society. We shall be 
defending its basic principles. 
  [Hulkova] Excuse me, but the note you referred to is, in 
fact, the government policy statement. 
  [Havel] Yes it is, precisely. It is the government policy 
statement delivered by the government in the parliament two 
years ago. On the basis of this policy statement, parliament 
voiced confidence in the government. Two years have gone by and 
here we are! 
  The coalition lacks concord on the basic outline of the 
reform of public administration, which is absolutely essential. 
I have serious concerns about this. I intend to step up my 
dealing with this issue, or perhaps get involved in it somehow. 
  I firmly believe that our ruling coalition will recall its 
policy statement and that it will quickly unite on the nature of 
this reform and its timetable. 
  [Hulkova] If I understand this correctly, you no longer 
regard this problem as an everyday problem of the coalition. 
  [Havel] I think that the controversy within the ruling 
coalition is quite serious. [passage omitted] It is a matter of 
a consensus within the ruling coalition to arrive at a decision 
with which all four parties [of the Czech coalition] will 
eventually agree. Up until now, this has been attained. I 
firmly believe that a consensus will be attained even in this 
case. This appears to be the most serious dispute within the 
coalition. 
  [Hulkova] You have mentioned your intention of joining the 
game. Do you regard yourself as a sufficiently strong player? 
  [Havel] I do not know to what extent I am a strong or a weak 
player, but what I do know is that the president's duty is to 
contribute to the country's political stability, to look after 
the country and possibly even to make sure that the promises 
given to citizens have been adhered to. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by editor Tomas Sulak on the second regular congress </F>
of the Christian Social Union in Moravia on 25 June--recorded] 
  [Text] [Sulak] The Christian Social Union [KSU], formed by 
the opposition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic 
Union-Czechoslovakia People's Party [KDU-CSL], headed by Josef 
Lux, held a congress today. The participants are in favor of 
following the spirit of the prewar Czechoslovak People's Party 
headed by Jan Sramek. 
  Milos Hanak, former member of the People's Party and the 
current chairman of the Vyskov, Moravia District privatization 
commission, was elected the new chairman of the party. Four new 
deputy chairmen and a new central committee of the party were 
also elected. The congress stripped former party Chairman 
Frantisek Michalek of all party posts. 
  According to its new chairman, Hanak, the KSU is currently 
operating within the framework of the so-called Realistic Bloc, 
considers itself to be a party of the center, and does not 
consider itself to be a regional party. On the contrary, it 
will attempt to address citizens of the whole Czech Republic. 
The party is based on the principle of Christian humanism, 
which is being perceived as an alternative to both dogmatic 
collectivism and unrestrained liberalism. It also emphasizes 
the social aspect of political life, and its political priority 
is to renew land-based administration [zemske zrizeni] in 
Moravia.

<F P=106> [Article by "(kou)": "The Civic Democratic Party Has Halted </F>
the Decline in Support"] 
  [Text] Prague--The Civic Democratic Party [ODS] fortified 
its dominant position in the opinion polls in June when it 
received 31.4 percent of popular support. The ODS's three-month 
decline has thus been halted (in March 32 percent would have 
voted for it, 31 percent in April, and 29 percent in May). This 
was apparent from the results of the opinion poll conducted by 
the Center for Empirical Research (STEM) in June among 1,500 
respondents. The Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] came 
second, with 13.9 percent; the Civic Democratic Alliance [ODA] 
came third, with 12.9 percent; and the Communist Party of 
Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] came fourth, with 6.8 percent. 
  The Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
[KDU-CSL] (4 percent in May; 6.2 percent in June) and the 
Association for the Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia 
[SPR-RSC] (4 percent in May; 5.2 percent in June) would also 
cross the 5-percent threshold for election to parliament; the 
governing coalition Christian Democratic Party [KDS], for 
example, would not. 
  The three strongest parties of the governing coalition would 
receive half the votes in total. 
  It is not obvious from the poll what percentage of the vote 
the Party of the Democratic Left and the Left Bloc Party would 
receive. STEM brackets these parties with the KSCM under the 
name Left Bloc conglomerate [and gives them] 10.9 percent. 
  According to STEM, 63 percent of the electorate would take 
part in the elections, 14 percent would not, and 23 percent 
still do not know. The June party rankings concur with the 
representative poll conducted by STEM in late May and early 
June, which involved almost 12,000 respondents (the newly 
constituted Democratic Union [DEU] would, according to it, 
receive 0.6 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by "(fr, ska)": "Gross Domestic Product Rose by 3.5 </F>
Percent in the First Quarter"] 
  [Text] Prague--Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus yesterday told 
reporters that, according to the year-on-year figures released 
by the Czech Statistical Office [CSU], the gross domestic 
product [GDP] in actual prices rose by 3.5 percent in the first 
quarter of 1994. The prime minister described this figure as a 
breakthrough. According to him, the other macroeconomic 
indicators are just as positive. 
  This result, which defines the CSU's original estimate 
(growth of 0.5 to 2.0 percent) considerably more precisely, 
comes from the processing of more complete data, CSU Deputy 
Chairman Ivan Sujan told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY yesterday. However, 
the current figures are also preliminary and may be further 
revised in an upward direction, he emphasized. The reason for 
this, according to him, is mainly the unfinished processing of 
the documents containing the customs statistics for exports. 
  Roughly half the increase can be ascribed to the 
extraordinary decline in GDP in the first quarter of 1993, with 
which the first quarter of 1994 is being compared. As a 
consequence of the anticipation of the new taxation system and 
the breakup of the federation, retail sales and construction 
work rose exceptionally in the last quarter of 1992 and, on the 
other hand, inevitably fell in the first quarter of 1993. The 
other half of the increase in the first quarter of 1994, 
however, obviously signals the expected economic recovery and an 
actual GDP increase at a, for the moment, "filtered" 
year-on-year rate of 1.5 to 2.0 percent, said the CSU deputy 
chairman. 
  All of the elements of aggregate demand contributed to the 
increase. Households' consumption increased in actual prices by 
8 percent and investment by 6.8 percent. The reduced base from 
the first quarter of 1993 also manifests itself here, however. 
The increase in domestic demand amounted to 9.2 percent; in 
foreign demand, the decline in exports (caused chiefly by 
another reduction in exports to the Slovak Republic) was more 
than compensated for by the significant increase in the export 
of services. Aggregate demand rose by 8 percent. Nevertheless, 
in the Czech Republic, there is still a not quite satisfied 
"hunger for imports," brought about by their restriction under 
central planning. A substantial part of the increase in 
aggregate demand is therefore swallowed up by this increase in 
imports, and only the smaller portion is left for the GDP 
increase, says I. Sujan. However, this phenomenon is, according 
to him, temporary and signals the possibility of a substantial 
acceleration in the increase in the GDP in coming years. 
  The share of industry in the formation of the GDP is 
gradually conforming to the share normal for market economies; 
it amounted to 42.3 percent in the first quarter of 1994. In 
1993, given a decline in industrial output of roughly 5 percent, 
the GDP, in essence, stagnated. During the first quarter of 
1994, the decline in industrial output came to a virtual halt, 
and, therefore, it is no surprise that the rate of the increase 
in the GDP is roughly four points higher, says Sujan. Apart 
from the changes in industry, the rise in the output of 
services, construction, and trade has also played a role in GDP 
activity. 
  The GDP, like the majority of economic indicators, is also 
influenced by regular seasonal fluctuations. After their 
influence has been filtered out, the GDP, in the first quarter 
of 1994, compared with the average for 1993, is 2.3 percent 
higher and, compared with the average for 1992, is 2 percent 
higher. The seasonally adjusted GDP in the first quarter of 
1994 is, however, still roughly 18 percent lower than the 
average for 1990. The CSU wonders, however, whether there 
really has been such a major decline between these years. That 
is to say, it is necessary to take into consideration the real 
effect of the so-called gray economy, which official statistics 
cannot ascertain at the moment. According to some estimates, it 
generates 10-15 percent of the GDP, and its output since 1990 
has increased by up to 50 percent. This would mean an increase 
in the established GDP level of 5 to 7.5 points. Another 
problem is that the price increases during transformation are 
not reflected in simple price increases alone but partly in an 
improvement in the quality and range of goods. The influence of 
the statistically unascertained part of this activity may be of 
the same extent as the gray economy. This would mean, according 
to Sujan, that the decline in the overall real product since 
1990 was, in fact, much less and was in the range of 3 to 8 
percent.

<F P=106> [Article by Jan Rezac: "Last Year Social Security Saved the </F>
State Budget 11.4 Billion Korunas"] 
  [Text] The final state budget report presented by the 
Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, which was discussed by the 
government yesterday, indicates that revenues based on social 
security premiums and other revenues of the ministry amounted to 
a total of 106.198 billion korunas [Kc] for 1993. When compared 
to the adjusted budget at Kc97.151 billion, this amounts to a 
difference of Kc9.047 billion. In the expenditures column, 
Kc2.353 billion was shown as savings because the budget 
anticipated expenditures of Kc121.965 billion and actually 
expended Kc119.611 billion for social security transfers. The 
overall positive balance in this chapter of the state budget 
thus amounts to Kc11.4 billion, according to what Ctirad 
Ondracka, budget director of the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. 
  The excess of revenues was mostly due to insurance premiums 
paid for workers, which accounted for revenues of Kc100.792 
billion, which means Kc7.958 billion more than was anticipated 
by the budget, which had figured on Kc92.835 billion. The reason 
was a virtual increase of 600,000 workers over what had been 
anticipated when the budget was being written, as well as a 
higher aggregate of basic assessments, upon the basis of which 
insurance premiums are computed. Higher revenues were also the 
result of insurance premiums paid by self-employed individuals. 
Arrears in insurance premiums amounted to Kc2.83 billion (2.7 
percent) and were caused primarily by the insolvency of payers. 
  Revenues for old-age pension purposes amounted to Kc80.052 
billion; those for hospitalization insurance were Kc13.75 
billion, and revenues based on the state employment policy 
amounted to Kc11.875 billion. Transfers for old-age pensions 
amounted to Kc72.4 billion, those for health benefits amounted 
to Kc11.961 billion, and the total paid out in conjunction with 
employment policy amounted to Kc3.146 billion. Overall 
expenditures (including administrative costs) were Kc88.647 
billion, and overall revenues amounted to Kc106.198 billion. The 
difference between revenues for insurance and expenditures for 
pensions, health benefits, and employment policy thus amounts to 
approximately Kc17.5 billion. In answer to a question by 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to how this surplus was utilized, Director 
Ondracka responded that, according to law, the revenues based on 
insurance premiums are part of the state budget that is used to 
defray all social transfers, and he said that the law had been 
adhered to. In terms of expenditures, it is necessary to include 
the state equalization contribution, which last year amounted to 
Kc6.1 billion, as well as the state transfers. The Ministry of 
Labor and Social Affairs last year engaged in a number of social 
measures that were not covered by the approved budget. According 
to Ondracka, this means that, were it not for these revenues 
based on insurance premiums, the Ministry of Labor and Social 
Affairs would not have been able to fund Kc2.8 billion worth of 
these measures. 
  Jindrich Vodicka, minister of labor and social affairs, 
noted 
in this connection that, although some components involving the 
collection of insurance premiums appeared to be a sort of 
quasi-surplus, the overall balance of revenues based on 
insurance premiums and all transfers is negative (revenues of 
Kc106.2 billion, expenditures of Kc119.6 billion). 
  After including the state equalization contribution in 
pensions paid out--something that is being readied for this 
year--there will actually not be any surplus. If, given the 
current development of unemployment, the contribution for the 
state employment policy becomes reduced by 1 percentage point, 
there will most likely even be a mild deficit. These possible 
adjustments in financing the system of social security are now 
being discussed with the Ministry of Finance. The government is 
not considering establishing an independent fund for social 
security, said J. Vodicka.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F>
Socialist Party, by Pal Szombathy; place and date not given] 
  [Text] I will by no means be partner to government 
measures that would unilaterally damage the situation of 
society's decisive majority, Gyula Horn, chairman of the 
Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told MAGYAR HIRLAP. The prime 
minister-designate said that equally serious problems are 
waiting to be solved in all ministries. 
  [Szombathy] After the signing of the coalition agreement 
between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], you 
said that you were expecting a congress of clarifying debates on 
26 June. Were you surprised that there were hardly any 
objections and the coalition agreement was ratified with an 
overwhelming majority? 
  [Horn] There must be a misunderstanding here because the 
ratification of the coalition agreement was the chief goal of 
this congress. We made this clear at the very beginning, 
indicating that it is impossible to change the text of the 
agreement, that it can only be rejected or accepted. Naturally, 
debates on accepting the text and on the document must not be 
banned at a congress; in fact, it is actually positive to give 
ground to this since this is a democratic and highest level 
party forum. Many contributors expressed doubts but the 
skeptical people also supported the agreement. The debates had 
taken place prior to this because the coalition agreement was a 
result of a very serious teamwork in the background, it was not 
prepared by two or three people. In February, we were given 
authorization to assert the party's program in the talks. 
  [Szombathy] Previously, it was said that, as opposed to the 
SZDSZ delegation's mandate, the MSZP's leadership would also 
have to have the list of political state secretaries approved by 
the congress. 
  [Horn] This remark is justified but I asked the congress to 
grant me some time to select the political state secretaries. 
The coordination talks are under way, therefore, the congress 
gave authorization, so I will submit the list of political state 
secretarial names to the national board of directors. The 
postponement has simple reasons: It was decided at the last 
minute which party will provide the ministers and state 
secretaries in the various ministries, and personnel issues were 
decided at the last minute. These issues cannot be ignored when 
the political state secretaries are selected. I would like the 
Socialist ministers themselves to decide whom they wish as 
MSZP-member state secretaries and with whom they would prefer to 
work together. 
  [Szombathy] On 26 June, MSZP members to fill the positions 
in parliamentary committees were also selected. Why did Matyas 
Szuros, former Socialist chairman of the parliament, not get any 
positions in any of the committees? 
  [Horn] The nominating committee drew up the list of names of 
committee officers and members. In the course of this, Szuros 
was not nominated for any of the positions. It would be good if 
Szuros could, for example, think about representing or leading 
the Hungarian section of the Interparliamentary Union, but this 
will be his decision. 
  [Szombathy] It might have been noticed that Janos Hajdu, 
whose running in the elections created a big stir, was not given 
a position either. 
  [Horn] I cannot determine this because I was not part of the 
nominating committee. I do not know if his name was raised at 
all. 
  [Szombathy] You have indicated that the new government might 
still have surprises when the country's economic situation is 
examined. If this is so, is it possible that the government's 
room for maneuver will become narrower, and can operational 
problems arise? Will unpopular measures be inevitable? 
  [Horn] They cannot influence the government's operation -- I 
did not mean these kinds of surprises -- only its room for 
maneuver. I could not by any means accept measures that reduce 
our popularity because, however bad the country's situation is, 
it is not so catastrophic that the only solution would be 
unpopular measures. There is a way out, a possibility to solve 
the problems but only through emphasizing social sensitivity. I 
will not by any means be a partner to any such measures that 
would unilaterally damage the situation of the society's 
decisive majority. On the basis of what I have learned so far, 
we will not take such measures. One factor has to be taken into 
consideration: The situation of citizens and their equality of 
opportunity will not improve to the extent they would expect. 
If they have faith in the new government then the tasks can be 
resolved step by step. People can be certain that their 
situation, living conditions, and sense of security will 
significantly improve within four years. Achieving this would 
indicate the government's successful operation. 
  [Szombathy] As a result of the coalition agreement, the MSZP 
received a large number of ministries that control critical 
areas and are interested in distribution. In your position as 
prime minister, at which ministries and between which ministries 
do you expect the biggest debates or crises? 
  [Horn] I do not think that I could name any ministries that 
do not have difficulties at the moment, be it defense, industry, 
or the environmental ministry. The problems are big and the 
demands are huge everywhere. The expert public has great 
expectations and it is difficult to meet these. All ministries 
have serious problems awaiting urgent measures. The level of 
these difficulties is the same in all areas and ministries.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of Free </F>
Democrats, by Anna Dano; place and date not given] 
  [Text] According to Ivan Peto, chairman of the Alliance of 
Free Democrats [SZDSZ], the coalition agreement gives equal 
responsibility to both parties. Peto believes that his party's 
convention will accept the agreement made with the Socialists, 
and an expert government will be set up in the wake of this. 
  [Dano] At the parliamentary group's meeting held during the 
coalition talks, the deputies advocated a bigger participation 
in economic issues. Has the SZDSZ acquired adequate guarantees 
and positions to implement its economic program? 
  [Peto] Many people had the misconception that the 
ministerial positions count. However, it is the guarantee 
system that ensures the implementation of our program. 
  [Dano] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has granted a 
number of spectacular concessions (the right of coordination, 
the role of counties in the local governments). Does this carry 
the danger that the SZDSZ would have the greater responsibility 
for the coalition's operational problems or possible dissolution? 
  [Peto] Joint governing carries joint responsibility. This 
cannot only have consequences for one of the parties. 
  [Dano] You had to yield with regard to the secret services, 
the Justice Ministry, and the position of chairman of 
parliament, although you had professional people for these 
positions. Does this cause personal conflicts within the party? 
  [Peto] I am sure that some people will feel that they should 
have been given a bigger role but we have to start from the 
position that the results of parliamentary elections have to be 
taken into consideration even at the coalition talks. We cannot 
ensure the desired position for all SZDSZ politicians who are 
actually suitable to fill these positions, even if we believe 
that they would be the best people suited to the given tasks. 
  [Dano] According to the program, many dozens of laws would 
have to be amended or new ones would have to be drawn up 
immediately (the laws in connection with the local government 
elections, agrarian law). What kind of parliamentary session do 
you propose for the summer? 
  [Peto] An approximately one-month long extraordinary session 
should be held. 
  [Dano] You have only just agreed on the most important 
issues. Legislative preparations will only begin after this. 
How will this result in draft laws in a few weeks? 
  [Peto] It would not be fortunate for the caretaker 
government to submit the draft laws. This is a technical 
problem and we have not yet decided how to overcome it. 
  [Dano] In the new government, we can again meet the second 
and third line of the Nemeth government, and we also have a 
former secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions, and a 
former member of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central 
Committee and Political Committee. What are your views on this 
situation? 
  [Peto] I am not familiar with the new government list. 
However, it was not our goal to restore the former Nemeth 
government. On this basis, we could also say that if someone 
was not good enough for the Nemeth government then how can he 
now be part of the Horn government? I do not think that this is 
a fortunate approach. 
  [Dano] In your view, are we going to have an expert 
government as was previously promised? 
  [Peto] Certainly. Although the cabinet might receive 
criticisms, in my view, the government will be of good quality. 
  [Dano] Have you selected the SZDSZ's state secretaries? 
  [Peto] We have selected some of them. I cannot yet speak 
about this. 
  [Dano] What kind of convention are you expecting? 
  [Peto] I am expecting an unbiased convention, similar to the 
one we had two weeks ago. The deputies will realistically 
assess the results and will accept the agreement. 
  [Dano] When can we expect the first party meeting that will 
assess the government's work? 
  [Peto] We will have an ordinary convention in the autumn.

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Gyula Horn, prime minister-designate </F>
and chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, and Ivan Peto, 
chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by correspondent 
Evelyn Forro; from the "Extra" program -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Forro] [passage omitted] A lot of things are 
being talked about--no doubt you also heard--first and foremost 
about the coming and going of the monies of foundations. It is 
being said that the corruption revealed to date is only the tip 
of the iceberg. Will you be launching any kind of investigation? 
  [Horn] People are talking a lot about this, and it is not 
certain that all of it is true. But it is true that there is a 
huge amount of corrupt deals, or suspected corruption. Just 
take a look at the press. Not a day passes without a report 
about some kind of scandal or a report about suspected corrupt 
deals. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] has committed 
itself to reexamining the privatization decisions made during 
the period between 1 April and the formation of the new 
government. The coalition agreement also contains things 
relating to this. There is the exact text, here is the exact 
text relating to this. 
  What I would like to stipulate is this: We do not have any 
intention of initiating any kind of calling to account vis-a-vis 
the present administration or government officials. But when 
there is a well-founded suspicion, a report, or anything else of 
that kind, in other words, if it becomes necessary for us to 
investigate, or to order the investigation of some kind of 
suspected corruption or illegal deal, then I do not think that 
the government, or the organs belonging to the government, will 
for a single minute hesitate to investigate it. 
  These things have to be investigated. If need be, in given 
cases, ad hoc investigating committees will have to be set up. 
This is demanded not only by a sense of justice, but also 
because there is a need once and for all to create order. A 
government that does not declare war on corruption, on abuses, 
is not a government. [passage omitted] 
  [Forro] There has been a huge amount of speculation about 
where changes will take place. [passage omitted] When will you 
decide about these, and what kind of changes have you in mind? 
  [Horn] Excuse me, let us take them in order. 
  [Forro] The Hungarian National Bank [MNB]. 
  [Horn] Yes. Here we will consider necessary a change at the 
head of the MNB. 
  [Forro] Incidentally, let me ask if you have already had 
discussions with people, have requests been made, or has the 
person already been found? 
  [Horn] Yes, we have held discussions, we have held 
discussions, yes, we do have our nominee for this office. 
  [Forro] Can this be made public yet? 
  [Horn] It still has to be coordinated, but for the time 
being 
I do not want--I would not like....[sentence incomplete as heard] 
  [Forro] All right, then all I will ask is has there been 
agreement on the nominee? 
  [Peto] Coordination will occur in every important personnel 
issue. At the MNB, as is known, there is a legal problem, if 
you like: The mandate of the present chairman of the MNB is no 
longer the mandate of the government that appointed him. It is 
also known that earlier he was a party politician. According to 
some opinions--I would now hasten to distance myself from this 
opinion--but there are opinions to the effect that if a 
politician becomes the chairman of a bank, then in accordance 
with the rules of political etiquette, if there is a change of 
government then it would be seemly for him to resign. 
  [Forro] MNB Chairman Peter Akos Bod has said he will not 
resign. 
  [Peto] Obviously, I also heard that was what he said. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Forro] Institutions responsible for privatization? 
  [Horn] At any rate, our opinion is that the privatization 
institutions have to be amalgamated because the present 
situation cannot be maintained. What is more, if possible it 
should be done on the basis of the Assets Handling joint-stock 
company. As for how and in what way its form will be resolved, 
that is the experts job. [passage omitted] 
  [Forro] Peter Boross has already announced that he will 
shortly be dismissing--or that he will be proposing the 
dismissal of -- Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik. Have you talked 
about who are going to be the new leaders of radio and 
television? 
  [Horn] Consultations were held about this between experts, 
and also between Ivan Peto and myself. Several candidates came 
into question. As far as my opinion is concerned--because it is 
possible that consultations will continue about this in the 
coming weeks-- well, the prime minister has announced that he is 
dismissing the two deputy chairmen. I will add that after this 
steps must be taken also in the matter of the dismissal of 
Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar. This falls within the 
competence and sphere of authority of the president of the 
Republic. What we would like is that afterward, during the 
present extraordinary term, the committee hearings and 
appointment of the leaders of the two media should take place. 
Naturally, in coordination, in agreement between the two 
parties, with regard to the people. [passage omitted] 
  I consider the following extremely important: The first 
thing is that this coaltion will at all events like to give 
greater weight and support to those areas--apart from the social 
welfare areas--which are of fundamental importance from the 
viewpoint of the country's situation, the population's 
situation, such as culture, education, public education, in 
strategic taskss, sport, and other areas. Here obviously, as 
Ivan Peto also said, the financial resources could mean very 
harsh restrictions. But at all events the situation has to be 
improved. There is a possibility that we can lead and maintain 
the differences of views in appropriate channels. By this I 
mean that our intention from the outset has been--and the 
coalition partners agreed on this--that the realization of the 
most important tasks designated by the government will be 
entrusted to the economic cabinet. So, we want to give the 
economic cabinet a much more important role than it has played 
up to now. The economic cabinet will have to decide on these 
issues, and if that does not succeed, then there will be further 
government forums where coordination can take place on these 
issues. 
  What pains me is that the country's financial opportunities 
are fairly narrow. Just one other thing -- I am sorry, forgive 
me for going on -- I would just like to add one more thing: I 
consider it extremely important, extraordinarily important, that 
sometime in the autumn, let us say in September or October at 
the latest, there should be concluded an economic-social 
agreement in which the participants will be the government, the 
employers, and the interest representation organs of employees. 
In other words, a kind of economic-social pact that will 
guarantee self-moderation and at the same time the realization, 
the fulfillment of demands that are considered just and 
fulfillable. This is a key issue from the viewpoint of the 
coming period. 
  [Forro] [passage omitted] What sort of relationship will the 
prime minister and the Foreign Ministry have? What I am 
thinking is that former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall practically 
directed foreign affairs himself. 
  [Horn] I do not expect any kind of conflict. The Foreign 
Ministry must be given the opportunity for independence. We 
also agreed that in the case of such a small country, a decisive 
task of the Foreign Ministry is to promote the solution of 
economic and social problems. So, in foreign affairs activity 
we ascribe very great importance to economic diplomacy. It is 
not with macroeconomics that we have to deal--beyond the 
necessary limits--but above all with helping the country to be 
able to step onto the path of modernization as soon as possible. 
  [Forro] Who will make up the team that will work directly 
alongside the prime minister. Can we have the names? 
  [Horn] I have asked Elemer Kiss to lead the Prime Minister's 
Office; he has experience in this area, he has already carried 
out excellent work. [passage omitted] There is one more thing 
that I consider very important, and that is that we should be 
thrifty with numbers. This will have to be a cheaper government 
and this applies equally to the ministries and the Prime 
Minister's Office. [passage omitted]

  [Text] President Arpad Goncz has evaluated the results of 
the coalition negotiations. We connect you with correspondent 
Laszlo Gardai at the parliament building: 
  [Gardai]] I am glad that the two parties could agree on the 
programs: In the future, good cooperation will depend on 
goodwill, dialogue, and teamwork, the president said. He 
expressed his hope that disputes can be resolved later, just as 
they can now. The two sides' flexible attitude is promising for 
the future, he said. The coalition cannot be avoided, and the 
result of the elections was not surprising for me, Arpad Goncz 
said, though the Hungarian Socialist Party's very large victory 
made the assumption that a social-liberal government was to be 
formed a bit doubtful. Arpad Goncz repeated that the second 
free elections had been more important than the first. The 
large turnout indicated that the country cares about its fate 
and wants a say in its affairs. 
  In connection with the coalition negotiations, Arpad Goncz 
said that he had not found any intention to shut out the 
opposition. Modest optimism is justified for the future, Arpad 
Goncz said. In reply to a question he said that he hopes the 
whole country will be able to cooperate in a harmonious way. He 
asked the coalition partners not to forget the opposition and to 
understand its role, if only because they represent one-third of 
the country in the parliament.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, political </F>
state secretary-designate of the Foreign Ministry, by Margit 
Kocsi; place and date not given] 
  [Text] Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, who, in accordance with the 
coalition agreement, will be the political state secretary of 
the new Foreign Ministry, envisages good and substantial 
cooperation between the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and 
the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. Speaking to MAGYAR 
NEMZET, the SZDSZ politician said that the new government's 
foreign policy ideas will already emerge at the meeting of the 
eight Eastern-Central European foreign ministers and the U.S. 
secretary of state in Warsaw on 7-8 July, although Hungary will 
probably still be represented by Geza Jeszenszky. 
  Istvan Szent-Ivanyi told us that efficient and correct 
working relations had developed in the past four years between 
him and Laszlo Kovacs, the foreign minister-designate. It also 
transpired from Istvan Szent-Ivanyi's words that he was 
preparing for the tasks of state secretary with great 
expectations, because this position has the advantage of 
providing a genuine role in direct foreign affairs activity and 
in shaping foreign policy. 
  Therefore, it was only natural that he considered everything 
thoroughly before deciding to accept the position. 
  As for the immediate tasks, he spoke about the handing over 
of the ministry and various important international events, like 
the foreign ministers meeting with Warren Christopher in Warsaw. 
Istvan Szent-Ivanyi pointed out that they would prefer to see 
the views of the new government gain ground. In his view, he 
thinks it is legally acceptable to have Geza Jeszenszky still 
represent Hungary at the aforementioned meeting. At the same 
time, it is also important that a close coordination precede all 
this, with the participation of Geza Jeszenszky, Laszlo Kovacs, 
and himself, as well as the professional diplomats. Another 
urgent task is the upcoming conference in the framework of the 
Central European Initiative, also at the foreign ministerial 
level. The most important international event to be directed by 
the Hungarian Foreign Ministry is the CSCE summit to be held in 
Budapest in the autumn. 
  In connection with the Hungarian minorities living beyond 
our 
borders, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi confirmed that the two-party 
coalition committee has already formulated the major principles 
in this area. They want to preserve the current level of support 
by any means, but this support must be open, public, and 
controllable through parliamentary means. Support for the 
educational, cultural, and mass communication needs of the 
minorities will receive priority. Answering a question, Istvan 
Szent-Ivanyi said he did not know whether the current Hungarian 
ambassador in Bucharest, Erno Rudas, will head the office of 
ethnic Hungarians living beyond our borders and of national 
minorities living in Hungary. The Socialists will decide on 
this state secretary position affiliated to the office of the 
prime minister. 
  In conclusion, Istvan Szent-Ivanyi expressed his 
satisfaction 
that, according to the coalition agreement, the SZDSZ can hold 
the position of chairman of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs 
Committee and, according to the plans, the concrete personnel 
decision will be made at the meeting of the SZDSZ group in 
Parliament on 27 June. Matyas Eorsi and Istvan Musto are 
mentioned as prospective candidates.

<F P=106> [Interview with Gabriella Farkas, outgoing deputy executive </F>
chairman of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Rita Csik; place 
and date not given] 
  [Text] In the future, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 
will rely more on party members' voluntary work. As a result of 
the member survey, it will soon become clear how many people 
have left the party. We spoke about this and about possible 
cooperation among the opposition in the course of the coming 
local government elections with Gabriella Farkas, the outgoing 
deputy executive chairman of the MDF. The Executive Committee 
has put Gabriella Farkas in charge of guiding the party machine 
until the national conference scheduled for the autumn. 
  [Csik] The MDF Executive Committee asked its members in 
writing to indicate whether they continue to feel themselves as 
party members. What is the reason for this survey of members? 
  [Farkas] The results of the recent elections and the 
subsequent slightly bitter mood of the members justifies the 
question of whether we can and want to continue working. This 
way, we can see who are the members that we can count on both in 
the course of the experts activity helping the party's 
parliamentary group and in the local government elections. 
There will, obviously, be people who say that they no longer 
want to continue with us, but I do not think that there are many 
of them. If we did not take the risk in facing up to this, we 
would be having to build on sand. 
  [Csik] The party will have to say goodbye to 320 paid 
employees out of a total of 400. Does this mean that the 
structure developed in the past four years will also change? 
  [Farkas] According to our election results, our budget 
support will decrease considerably. This is why we have to 
reduce the apparatus both in the central office and the 
provinces. Although we are streamlining our party, the system 
and principles will remain the same; we will be able to rebuild 
all of this without special restructuring when we have the means 
to do so. 
  [Csik] The opposition, including the MDF, will now represent 
a much smaller weight in parliament than in the past four years. 
Will there be any possibility of opposition politics at all? 
  [Farkas] If the government coalition wants it, they can pass 
almost everything through voting. However, I think that, 
through the committees, we will have the chance to assert our 
opposition position. The composition of our parliamentary group 
is fortunate too, because we can send expert and well-trained 
deputies to every parliamentary committee. I simply do not 
believe that it can happen in a democratic parliament that a 
better proposal than that of the government party is rejected 
merely because it comes from the opposition. 
  [Csik] Local government elections will be held in this 
autumn. Can you envisage cooperation between the opposition 
parties to defeat the government parties? 
  [Farkas] I am convinced that there is a need for local 
cooperation. Not only because this is a possibility that brings 
results, but also because only this can be a successful policy 
in local political activity. Local political activity should be 
"above" the parties participating in the election struggle. One 
of the most important principles is who can do most for the 
given town or village. I can envisage a situation in which the 
opposition parties will run with a common candidate in many 
places or they will support each other's candidates. 
  [Csik] The MDF will hold a national conference in autumn. To 
what extent will the leadership change? 
  [Farkas] The MDF national conference will have to complete 
the "documentation" of the election defeat. We will not be able 
to start building if we drag out this analysis for too long. 
Our election failure was not only due to human error or 
mistakes. The kamikaze role that the party accepted in 1990 is 
among the major causes of our defeat. I hope the causes will be 
examined honestly and the election of a new leadership will be 
made accordingly. If we do not do this, we will be going the 
wrong way. It is absolutely certain that part of the leadership 
will change. Obviously, the members are dissatisfied with some 
leaders, but some members of the leadership will be needed for 
continuity. This will not be another party. This will remain 
the Hungarian Democratic Forum.

  [Text] Tibor Pongracz, chairman of the board of directors 
of the State Assets Agency [AVU], has resigned. The state 
secretary for privatization is the fourth member of the board of 
directors to step down from his position. The 11-member body 
has thereby decreased in size to seven. 
  Tibor Pongracz told NEPSZABADSAG that the prime minister 
accepted his resignation with effect from 1 July. The AVU's 
board of directors is still capable of making decisions because 
six members are sufficient for decisionmaking.

    [Editorial Report] The Openness Club, a media monitoring 
organization, contends that by exhibiting blatant bias against 
the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) as its popularity increased 
in the months before the May election, Hungary's central public 
service radio and television damaged their own credibility and 
contributed to the MSZP's sweeping victory over the Hungarian 
Democratic Forum (MDF) and the other right-of-center government 
parties. Published in the 3 June daily NEPSZABADSAG and entitled 
"Was the Government's Downfall Caused by Its Own Television?", 
the organization's study is based on a detailed analysis of 
1,322 news items and commentaries in the 1 April-8 May period, 
as well as on purported general "tendencies" perceived in the 
media since last September. The Openness Club, a controversial 
organization that frequently criticized the outgoing 
government's media policies during the last four years, was 
founded in 1988 under the sponsorship of Hungarian Socialist 
Workers Party reformer Imre Pozsgay (Budapest Radio, 29 October 
1988) and has been associated not only with former reform 
communists but also with the liberal opposition. Interviewed in 
the liberal daily MAGYAR HIRLAP (4 April 1991), Gabor Halmai--a 
founder of the Club and "legal adviser to the Constitutional 
Court"--urged that regulation of the media should be based on 
the "liberal... Anglo-Saxon model." 
  The study contends that in the preelection campaign, a "gulf 
formed between popular opinion and the mass media." The media at 
first ignored signs of the MSZP's popularity and "miscalculated" 
its political impact, treating the liberal Alliance of Free 
Democrats (SZDSZ), which finished a distant second, as the 
government parties' main opponent and "devoting... just about 
equal time to the MDF and SZDSZ." This show of fairness did not 
extend to the MSZP, the study asserts. In March, the MSZP 
appeared in only half as many news items as the MDF and the 
SZDSZ. By April coverage of the MSZP was expanded, but rather 
than reporting neutrally on the party's rise, the media 
"denigrated" the popularity polls and questioned their 
objectivity, contends the Openness Club. Moreover, although in 
that month the number of news items devoted to the socialists 
increased, only about half them presented the socialists' own 
views, while the other half focused on criticism of the MSZP by 
its "adversaries." MSZP politicians were also denied publicity 
commensurate with their party's prominence. According to the 
study, MSZP chairman Gyula Horn was only fourth among party 
leaders in the time he was given to "express himself in his own 
words," coming after not only Prime Minister Peter Boross but 
also after Viktor Orban, whose party barely made it into 
parliament, and after Janos Palotas, whose party failed to gain 
entry. 
  The Openness Club's study describes several programs in 
detail. Analyzing 20 programs of the Hungarian Television series 
"A Nap" (The Day), the Openness Club asserts that except in the 
case of two programs with neutral themes, the series failed to 
present "an objective and balanced" report on clashing political 
opinions. "Instead, the programs showed an unequivocal 
commitment to the political views of the governing coalition" 
and "a marked hostility toward the views of the opposition, 
above all those of the MSZP." Some of the programs were an 
outlet for the government's "success propaganda," focusing on 
the economic achievements of the past four years, while others 
were "arranged to create the impression of a left-wing threat" 
from the MSZP. In an attempt to highlight this alleged threat, 
the Openness Club asserts, on the eve of the election Hungarian 
Television resorted to further "incredible manipulation" and 
broadcast a series of films that tried to create the impression 
of "continuity" between the activities of the MSZP--a successor 
of the reformist wing of the Communist Party--and the worst 
abuses of the Stalinist and Kadarist periods. Such 
"disinformation" was self-defeating, the Openness Club suggests, 
because the "uncertainty" and "fear" it inspired in viewers 
turned them against the government-dominated media and 
ultimately against the government parties.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Uncertainty Surrounds Program for </F>
Purchasing Shares on Favorable Terms; Securities of Listed Firms 
More in Demand"] 
  [Text] Although the Program for Purchasing Shares on 
Favorable Terms (KRP) is still in place, preparations for the 
stock issues of the two remaining firms in the program's 
experimental stage have slowed down perceptibly, under the 
influence of statements made about the program's future. 
  Economic-policy experts of the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist 
Party] and SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] have said 
repeatedly that the KRP ought to be suspended. The AVU [State 
Property Agency] has not adopted any new decision for the time 
being, but preparations for the stock issues of Global T.H. and 
Pannonia Hotels, respectively, have slowed down. However, there 
have been also technical problems at the latter firm. 
  Officials at the AVU nevertheless believe that, sooner or 
later, there will be stock issues by both Global and Pannonia 
Hotels, even if the new government suspends the KRP. At worst in 
that case, the issues will not take place within the framework 
of the KRP. The officials deem it important that privatization 
through the stock exchange be retained in the armory of 
privatization tools. As one official put it, that strengthens 
the stock market, and the stock market in its turn strengthens 
privatization. Many foreign investors, particularly financial 
investors, are willing to invest only in firms that are listed 
on the stock exchange.

  [Text] According to the managing director of the 
Budapest Stock Exchange, the elections have caused some 
uncertainty in the stock market. But that is not a consequence 
of a change in political direction. Rather, the uncertainty can 
be attributed to the fact that the details of the new 
government's economic policy are still unknown. 
  In the opinion of Jozsef Rotyis, international causes are 
behind the slow decline of share prices over an extended period. 
The Prague and the Warsaw exchanges, for instance, have suffered 
sharper declines of their share prices than the Budapest Stock 
Exchange has. On the other hand, the present slow correction is 
also a result of exaggerated expectations at the beginning of 
the year. 
  Nevertheless, the managing director believes that waiting to 
see what the change of governments will bring is also a 
significant factor in the decline of the exchange's trading 
volume. This is not an exodus of foreign capital, but new 
investments usually are not initiated at times like this, he 
emphasized. 
  Jozsef Rotyis expressed concern about ideas that are being 
voiced frequently nowadays--namely, that in privatization it is 
necessary to concentrate on finding strategic investors and, 
therefore, public offerings and privatization through the stock 
exchange will be playing a smaller role in the future. Which 
would mean that large financial investors would mostly shun 
privatization in Hungary and would turn to other countries in 
the region. To retain the presence of these large investors in 
the Hungarian stock market, domestic small investors must also 
be attracted to a greater extent, because only that can ensure 
the stock market's liquidity. 
  However, the stock exchange expects foreign investment to 
become more lively once the uncertainties regarding the new 
government's economic policy have subsided. An indication of 
this is a report in last Friday's WALL STREET JOURNAL to the 
effect that George Soros's investment fund, which manages 
several hundred million dollars, is about to embark on a more 
active investment policy in Central Europe. And the managing 
director of the Budapest Stock Exchange believes that other 
investors will be following in Soros's footsteps.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jonila Godole: "The U.S. Is Keeping a </F>
Stepmother's Eye -- Greece or Albania....?] 
  [Text] It is now some time since the situation in the 
Albanian-Greek relationship became a cause for concern. Many 
incidents, Albanians murdered while asleep or awake, beaten en 
masse, and so on, but...the problem that makes you forget many 
other things is the large number of our refugees that are living 
and working in Greece. Analysts underscore the fact that 
refugees, including a large number of Albanians, cost Greece 
tens of millions of U.S. dollars per year (this figure has been 
accurately extracted by a U.S. Commission for the Balkans.) 
  Nevertheless, the Greek-Albanian "line" is vacillating in 
such a way that makes you feel something new is going to happen, 
and if we bear in mind the declarations of certain Greek circles 
laying claim to Albanian lands, our fears and doubts about peace 
between our two countries grow. However, if we refer to foreign 
news reports, a certain position of sitting on the fence, or as 
our people put it, a "neither here, nor there" stance is to be 
observed, particularly on the part of the United States. 
  For example, in an article published the day before 
yesterday 
in "The Balkan News," the following parallel conclusions were 
drawn: Albania must be convinced that Greek aims do not include 
the annexation of North Epirus. In the same way, Greece must be 
convinced that it is not Albania's aim in itself to eject the 
Greek minority from its southern provinces. Further on, it is 
added that the influx of people from Northern Albania (the part 
of Kosovo) are aimed at changing the constitution of the 
population and the equilibrium in the region. In fact it sounds 
strange enough to declare, as the U.S. newspaper does, that 
Greece does not have such aims, at a time when events showing 
the opposite are taking us by surprise. Another thing that 
attracts our attention is the somewhat particular attitude 
regarding the two points: Greece and Kosovo. 
  So the United States alone must be the reliable power, 
capable of blaming both sides if necessary, provided the 
necessary practice of "good-neighborliness" is guaranteed. 
  Thus, the United States is helping us, or why not the 
Greeks, 
if you like....?

<F P=106> [Commentary by Agron T.: Happy Retirement, Mr. Ryerson! </F>
Welcome Mr. Lake!] 
  [Text] President Clinton's announcement about his 
intention to appoint Mr. Joseph Edward Lake as new U.S. 
ambassador to Albania arrived at a time when political analysts 
had already come across signs of change in the U.S. stance 
toward the Albanian opposition and particularly its largest 
force, the PS [Socialist Party]. Such signs were contacts 
established in our country by representatives of the Republican 
and National Democratic Institute, and several interviews, 
comments, and analyses of the "Voice of America," which, in 
stark contrast with the past, began mirroring our reality, with 
our political developments, the course of our 
government-opposition relations, and the State Department's 
report on the situation of human rights and political freedom of 
the opposition in Albania in 1993. 
  However, the basic arguments in support of this belief were 
the thaw, after a long winter, in relations between the U.S. 
Embassy in Tirana and the opposition parties, several meetings 
between its staffers and PS leaders, and Mr. Ryerson's presence 
at a news conference on the Nano affair. In fact, it was not 
the first time that Mr. Ryerson's presence or absence, and a 
number of other public activities in his capacity as U.S. 
ambassador, had become the topic of discussion and 
interpretation, ranging from truth to conjecture, from naivete 
to presumption. 
  None of the analysts or observers denied that his role in 
Albanian political developments over the last three years had 
been obvious, and this had been possible not only because he was 
the top diplomatic representative of the U.S. superstate, but 
also because of the intimacy that he created with certain 
circles. However, when it came to evaluate his influence, 
assessments varied to the extreme opposites. Though these 
factors only acted like yeast in giving shape to opinions, 
today, for certain purposes, they are decisive, reaching even to 
a point of vesting Mr. Ryerson's personality with powers that 
nobody could possibly possess alone, even in his important 
position, for the following reasons: 
  1. Whatever Mr. Ryerson's origins as a U.S. citizen, U.S. 
interests are sacred to him, since, as a U.S. Administration 
employee, he is legally obliged to defend them whereever they 
exist, and as an official in foreign service, he has the 
responsibility to maintain the system of meeting these interests 
when the system is working, or build one and put it into 
operation wherever it is lacking. After a gap of 45 years, Mr. 
Ryerson as the number one U.S. diplomat in Tirana, had the task 
of installing in Albania a system that could enable the 
implementation of U.S. policy toward or regarding our country. 
Within this framework, not only did his past undertakings in 
Albania become clearer, but it can also be explained why, in 
certain cases, he had to break with the usual conventions of his 
rank. 
  Today there is no need to speak of U.S. interests in 
eradicating communism, even in Albania. Nor is it worth 
repeating our politicians' conclusions, explaining why the PDSH 
[Democratic Party] was the only Albanian political force that 
could accomplish such a task. Albeit transcending the limits of 
his diplomat's status, Mr. Ryerson's busy activities in the 
run-up to the parliamentary elections of 1992 in actual fact 
reflected the truth regarding trust toward such political forces 
that could simultaneously carry out the "eradication of 
communism," and pave the way for the furthering of U.S. policy 
in Albania. Thus, Mr. Ryerson "helped the PDSH to conquer 
Albania," while individuals or groupings within this party 
guaranteed the implementation of the U.S. strategy in our 
country. In a nutshell, the extremely natural functioning of 
the official scheme of Albanian-U.S. relations, to which Mr. 
Ryerson made his own contribution, is expressed in President 
Berisha's words: "The United States and the U.S. institutions 
and Government, directly or through their missions in Tirana, 
have been very close to us from the very first moments of the 
democratic movement, and have supported us unequivocally ever 
since." This is also expressed in the conclusions drawn by 
foreign analysts and observers, who, apart from branding 
Berisha's regime as pro-United States, also emphasize Albania's 
absolute dependence on Washington. 
  Along the same lines is Mr. Ryerson's participation in 
various rehabilitation ceremonies, particularly in reburials, or 
in activities to honor former pupils of the Harry Fultz 
Technical School, and so on. In essence it expresses also the 
U.S. commitment morally to reward various Albanian citizens not 
only for their anti-communist activities, but also for the 
services that they have previously rendered for the United 
States. 
  In Albanian Canon Law, without referring to history, the 
roles of Host and Guest are closely related to each other. The 
guest is greatly honoured and respected; he has pride of place 
in the house, but the host is responsible for every 
transgression or harm that the guest might commit while under 
the host's hospitality. Nevertheless, as masters of Albania 
until the next elections, the Albanian people have chosen those 
politicians to whom they gave their votes on 22 March 1992. 
  2. At a election meeting in March 1992, in the city of 
Korca, Mr. Ryerson is supposed to have said: "If the PD wins, 
all the Communists will be out of a job." If his actions and 
presence were the epicenter of analyses of the U.S. stance 
toward Albania's political forces, these words were used as a 
refrain by the majority of those who had certain reservations 
about Mr. Ryerson. If you analyze the words in detail, you find 
concentrated in them the dilemma between the man and the 
official, between duty and reason, and how it was properly 
solved. It is another thing that the Albanians swallowed this 
warning message only when the PDSH, after gaining an absolute 
majority of votes, approved Law 24/1, which sanctioned the newly 
commenced administrative reform. 
  It is not that "the great U.S. policy has understood its 
preposterous interference in Albanian politics"; this shuffling 
of U.S. ambassadors in Albania follows the natural course of 
U.S. diplomatic procedures. The time that it was announced is 
yet another argument in favor of the analysts' views. Within 
the framework of U.S. pragmatism, it shows that the policy is 
actually at the stage of working out tactics in accordance with 
the constant strategic purposes. They are enriched with new 
elements, or new tactics are being prepared to effect the 
"metamorphosis of Albanian opinion on the United States," and to 
be adequately prepared for future developments inside or 
engulfing Albania from without. Every biographical study of the 
new ambassador to Albania would lead you to these same 
conclusions. 
  The news about Mr. Lake's appointment, who gained his 
doctorate at Texas Christian University, reached Albania (a 
member of the Conference of Islamic Countries, whose Christian 
population, catholic and orthodox, and their religious 
institutions enjoy a "special care" evinced by the churches of 
neighboring countries) at the same time as the U.S. media 
announced the establishment of the International Protestant 
Church as the newest international church, based in Tirana. The 
new ambassador will certainly be welcomed by his fellow 
countrymen, who for some time have been engaged in activities in 
Albania as representatives of various religious sects. 
  Who is Mr. Lake? Mr. Lake is a former director of the U.S. 
State Department's Operations Center, where he worked closely 
with the White House and other departments in the same year when 
the collapse of the communist system in Eastern Europe was 
projected and actually took place. He is a highly qualified 
specialist with a "successful career" and "great experience" in 
East Asia and the Pacific in general, and on China in 
particular. Mr. Lake is preparing to take up his position in 
Tirana at a time when analysts foresee that the left wing is 
likely to come to power, when they observe that China's 
interests in Albania have remained constant, and when our 
present decision-makers have by necessity already understood the 
philosophical importance of the saying "Make as many new friends 
as you like, but do not forget the old ones!" and are, albeit 
with certain reluctance, trying to act accordingly. 
  The former Number Two of the U.S. Embassy in Sofia is 
waiting 
for the Senate's approval to take up his new post in Albania, 
where, according to observers and politicians, a "Bulgarian 
scenario" is being implemented. At the same time analysts 
insist that the "Albania-Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia -- FYROM]-Bulgaria corridor," as a "programmed 
policy," is part and parcel of the U.S. strategy in the Balkans. 
While waiting to settle himself on the western edge of this 
segment, Mr. Lake is learning Albanian, as he learned Chinese 
and Bulgarian. 
  Ambassadors come and go. Although acclaimed as the 
mastermind of their respective embassies, they are nothing more 
than tiny particles in the huge mechanism that sets in motion 
the open policies worked out in state chancelleries. It is the 
Albanians themselves who have made Albania in the past and will 
make it in the future. With the help also of the United States, 
Europe and.... Enough of "enemies from East to West," but not to 
the point of, say, turning your back on Europe for the sake of 
the United States, or flying off toward the Islamic region, or 
overturning obsolete chests to obtain outdated schemes of 
ethnic-religious rows with neighbors, or brushing aside 
China.... In Western policy, the principle of "more relations, 
fewer problems" has gained the status of an axiom, and therefore 
Albania will survive only by giving everyone his due place. 
  Ambassadors come and go, and even if they speak Albanian, it 
is not their mother-tongue. 
  A happy old age and retirement, Mr. Ryerson! Welcome Mr. 
Lake! [previous sentence in English]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by reporter Marioara </F>
Stoianovici from the publication LIBERTATEA issued in Vojvodina, 
Republic of Serbia, in Bucharest on 18 May: "Romania, an Open 
Country"] 
  [Text] [Stoianovici] I would like to thank you very much 
for your kindness in receiving me and I would like to extend to 
you cordial greetings on behalf of my colleagues and of all the 
Romanians who live in the Yugoslav Banat region. 
  [Iliescu] Thank you. 
  [Stoianovici] Likewise, I would like to mention that the 
meeting with you means for us encouragement and an extremely 
great moral support but, at the same time, it also shows your 
concern for us, the Romanians living beyond Romania's borders. 
  [Iliescu] Now more than ever. Because for a long time this 
issue was ignored in our country and no attention was paid to 
it. You who live in Vojvodina have had a somewhat privileged 
situation. I visited you in Novi Sad when I was still working in 
the area of "water management." In Vojvodina you succeeded in 
establishing a center for actions aimed at preserving interest 
in Romanian culture, Romanian language, and literary works in 
the Romanian language, while the Vlachs, for example, who are 
living in the Timok Valley, are more oppressed. They did not 
have many opportunities in the past either. As far as I know, 
they are not really recognized as an ethnic group today either, 
and therefore their situation and their position is much worse 
than yours. We have to find ways to help them as well. 
  [Stoianovici] The Romanian minority living in the Yugoslav 
Banat region is well preserved, and therefore we make great 
efforts to continue to preserve our minority even in this 
current period of great crisis. If you will allow me, I will 
start asking you some questions now. 
  [Iliescu] I'll answer you with pleasure. 
  [Stoianovici] Thank you. My first question is the 
following: As a result of the December 1989 revolution, Romania 
had resolutely started off on the path of democracy and market 
economy. This path is quite hard in the new geopolitical and 
economic situation that emerged after the downfall of communism 
in East European countries. How do you view the results 
obtained in this confrontation with the difficulties of 
transition? 
  [Iliescu] One can talk about two different aspects here. In 
the political sphere, things have progressed better. I would 
not say in an easier way, but definitely faster, because 
political systems can cope with such situations. Revolutions 
happen generally in the field of political relations in society. 
One power is eliminated and replaced by another one. This can 
be achieved in the way it happened in Romania, that is, through 
a sudden crash, with a revolutionary elan, through people's 
revolt. The old state structures were eliminated, demolished, 
and new provisional structures have been established, which, 
later through free elections -- we had two rounds of elections, 
in 1990 and in 1992 -- established the appropriate framework for 
the endorsement of the new constitution. The judicial bases and 
the structures of the new institutions of the rule-of-law state 
were also established. Thus, I believe that in the area of 
political relations in our society, these four years have marked 
radical changes in the physiognomy of the Romanian society. We 
have moved from the monopoly of a single party to the multiparty 
system and from a party-state toward a rule-of-law state, with 
separation of powers, and with the democratic system of electing 
state bodies and establishing all necessary institutions. 
Certainly, this is a process that will continue mainly in the 
field of properly organizing the society, that is, the civilian 
society. Thus, in this respect, things have progressed. 
  Things are progressing a little bit slower in the area of 
economy because the economic system is a more inertial system. 
In this case, accumulations require time. Certainly, many 
things have changed. First of all, as a result of changes in 
the political field, a collapse of economic structures took 
place. We used to have a super-centralized, state-run economy. 
As early as the beginning of 1990, the central structures were 
dismantled and a rapid decentralization process took place in 
the economy. We took measures to ensure the liberalization of 
domestic and foreign trade and liberalization of prices and 
salaries. We made efforts to achieve the convertibility of our 
national currency, the leu, a process that only this year has 
reached a certain stabilization. Thus, many changes have taken 
place in the field of economy, but economy is a much more 
delicate issue. 
  Certainly, these changes also meant certain disruptions, 
because the structure of the centralized, rigid economy, as it 
used to be, had its own internal rules. The moment this 
structure broke, its internal rules also broke, without having 
been replaced with something else, without a market economy with 
all its specific structures and institutions having been 
established. This brought about disorder and disruptions at the 
level of national economy. One can also add to this the 
international situation, the collapse of the international 
system in which we had been integrated, namely the CEMA. Thus, 
some markets disappeared altogether or became rather limited and 
we lost traditional partners. We could feel this situation in 
our entire economy. 
  In practical terms, currently our industry is working at 
half 
of its potential. Likewise, in agriculture we also encountered 
great difficulties as a result of the dissolution of cooperative 
structures. The economy is coping with difficulty with this 
situation. Revival is a much more difficult process. However, 
I believe that we have overcome the most difficult times. 
  At a macroeconomic level, 1993 was the most difficult year 
for us, because, on the one hand, we felt the effects of this 
decline in economic activity and because it was the year when 
the most difficult economic measures were taken such as cut of 
subsidies and introduction of value-added tax and of some 
financial discipline measures which were aimed at halting the 
quite high pace of inflation. Last year, the inflation rate 
reached 300 percent and this was our peak. Certainly, this does 
not impress you in Yugoslavia because... 
  [Stoianovici] Yes, inflation is much higher there. 
  [Iliescu] But for our situation it is very high. And this 
caused great difficulties. Among other things, one of the 
effects of the high inflation rate was the lack of capital for 
enterprises and economic companies, which started off with 
insufficient capital due to the old mechanisms of centralized 
economy. According to the plan, they received only half of the 
necessary financial resources. The rest was obtained from bank 
loans, as an element of additional control exercised on them. 
When the plan disappeared, the major source of ensuring 
financial resources also disappeared and all companies became 
dependent only on banks which also had less than sufficient 
resources. Inflation and increase of interest rate led to a 
situation in which enterprises found themselves completely 
without capital and an economic-financial blockage emerged that 
we are still experiencing today. 
  Currently, the year 1994 is marked mainly by this big 
problem 
of financial blockage. However, we hope that things will 
slowly, slowly stabilize at a macroeconomic level. This year 
one can already notice a drop in the rate of inflation. Last 
year production marked a zero increase. Thus, the decline of 
industrial production was halted. However, today we are facing 
the task of reviving industrial production and ensuring its 
increase. Agriculture also shows signs of revival. Foreign 
trade, mainly exports, also started to show some improvement. 
Thus, there are premises that will turn 1994 into a year of 
revival and improvement of the economic activity. However, as 
far as people's living conditions are concerned, it is still a 
difficult year. There is still a big difference between 
people's income and prices. We have a large number of 
unemployed people, that is, 1.2 million. Thus, from the 
viewpoint of the microeconomy and people's standard of living, 
1994 still remains a difficult year. However, with the premises 
that I was talking about earlier, there are great chances that 
at least next year hopefully we will mark a perceptible 
improvement in people's lives. 
  [Stoianovici] If you will allow me, I am going to ask you 
the second question. By being accepted into the European 
democratic structures, Romania has demonstrated that it is 
attached to the democratic values that are promoted in the 
world. I would like to ask you to mention a few more important 
elements that enabled and ensured this opening to the world. 
  [Iliescu] As I was saying before, all these changes that 
have taken place mainly in the country's political life were 
record events for us, which enabled us to join European bodies. 
There were certain prejudices toward Romania and the countries 
located in this geographical area in general, but particularly 
against Romania. This was also caused by a very strong 
anti-Romanian lobby that sprang up from Romania itself. The 
internal political struggle was reflected in an unhealthy way in 
the international arena and this caused some reservations toward 
our country in connection with the establishment of democratic 
structures, although everything spoke in favor of it. 
  Romania experienced the most acute revolution, because of 
the 
people's uprising that dissolved old structures at one push. 
Only five months after the people's uprising of December 1989, 
we held the first elections in the presence of a large number 
of parties that emerged in this period. Nobody contested the 
validity of those elections. Parliament was elected, which was 
also a constituent assembly at the same time. We worked for one 
and a half years to draft the constitution, an exclusively 
democratic constitution, which is in line with all international 
standards of such fundamental documents and which was 
appreciated as such. On the basis of the new constitution, we 
organized local elections and general elections in 1992. Thus, 
the whole unfolding of political life was a proof of a constant 
progress, without any reservation and with no chance of 
returning to the old regime. As a mater of fact, it is aberrant 
even to question whether a revival of the old structures in the 
political sphere or economic area is possible. The idea itself 
is aberrant. 
  The political struggle is carried out by people and groups 
of 
people. One cannot conceive of building a democratic society on 
the basis of the same rules that governed the totalitarian 
regime. In fact, the exclusion of a group of people from the 
normal life, from social life, from political life was the rule 
of those who were playing the role of "champions of democracy." 
They were excluding groups of people from the country's 
political life. According to what criteria? According to their 
subjective criteria. Thus, if a former [communist] party member 
became a member of a right-wing formation, he was "clean" as far 
as his past is concerned. If a former member of the Communist 
Party remained a left-wing supporter, this was unacceptable from 
the very beginning! What I mean is that these are subjective 
rules and subjective judgments that have nothing to do with 
democratic principles which are governing society. We all have 
to change this society and we all have to be valuable members of 
this society, and each of us should contribute with all our 
might to our progress. 
  However, I believe that in the international arena we have 
overcome this stage. Thus, there was this period of reticence 
and reservations toward us. However, currently, I believe that 
things are regarded with much greater understanding and realism, 
and this understanding should characterize the political 
thinking in general. 
  Last year we marked a few events: association, with full 
rights, to the Council of Europe; association to the European 
Union, initially to the NATO Cooperation Council; and now we 
have signed the Partnership for Peace document. Recently we have 
been accepted into the Western European Union with a status of 
associate partner. Thus, now one can clearly talk about 
openings that prove these tendencies that refer not only to the 
internal processes in the countries in our region, but also to a 
new way of political thinking in Europe and throughout the world 
in general. 
  [Stoianovici] My next question refers to relations with 
Yugoslavia. Currently, Yugoslavia is going though maybe its 
worst times in its troubled history. Yugoslavia has always had 
traditional ties of good neighborliness, friendship, and 
cooperation with Romania. What can you tell us about the 
current stage of these relations, certainly also viewed from the 
perspective of the lifting of sanctions? 
  [Iliescu] Our relations have always been and have remained 
good, even in conditions of this tragic period for the peoples 
of Yugoslavia. We are nurturing absolutely the same feelings of 
friendship and solidarity with the peoples of Yugoslavia and 
with the Serb people, with whom we have always had relations of 
good neighborliness. We have never had conflicts throughout 
history. Therefore, we have followed with great concern these 
dramatic events in the Yugoslav state, this dissolution of the 
federation, and mainly the outbreak of conflicts that have 
brought about so much tragedy. In these circumstances we tried 
to preserve open relations and contacts on the one had with all 
the sides involved in the conflicts and, on the other hand, with 
all the new state formations that have been established. I 
believe that we have good relations not only with the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro, but also with 
Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM], and Bosnia. 
  What matters is that this state of strife, maximum tension, 
and conflict should be overcome. We have hailed all efforts 
made in the world to assist on the one hand the actions aimed at 
halting the conflict and state of war, and, on the other hand, 
efforts made to find political, reasonable, and adequate 
solutions for all sides involved. Thus, we pleaded for a 
realistic attitude and for encouraging contacts and dialogue, 
and for finding adequate solutions at the negotiation table. We 
knew that it was not easy, especially after military conflicts 
opened. 
  This type of conflict aggravates the situation even more, 
increases tension, and makes more difficult the reestablishment 
of normal contacts and of a logical and realistic approach to 
all issues. However, the more so, we believe that the major 
mission of the international community is not to take unilateral 
and partial positions but to try and facilitate political 
contacts and eliminate sources of conflict. Likewise, we have 
hailed all more recent efforts, including recent meetings in 
Geneva. Although I realize that the disputed issues are still 
very serious, nevertheless, I believe that the path of dialogue 
is the only possible way for progress. To continue on the path 
of military conflict means to aggravate things even more. 
  [Stoianovici] I believe that my next question is the longest 
one. One of the major goals of the revolution is to change the 
attitude toward Romanians who live beyond the country's borders, 
contrary to the previous position of ignoring their existence. 
As far as we are concerned, the new policy that is being 
promoted has proved to be constructive. Currently, we are all 
confronted with a very serious economic situation in Yugoslavia. 
To what extent can Romania, the mother country, assist the 
Romanian minority in Yugoslavia in its efforts to preserve and 
cultivate their Romanian language and culture? 
  [Iliescu] You have remarked it correctly, the former 
attitude was a mistake of the Romanian state. Regardless of the 
structure of a state, it cannot ignore its own citizens or 
fellow nationals who live in other areas. And this was one of 
Ceausescu's big mistakes and stupidities, to treat the Romanian 
diaspora with hostility and regard all those Romanians who left 
the country to live in various other places as traitors. Even 
Romanians who for hundreds of years have lived in the Balkan 
region and in neighboring countries were ignored. 
  After the Romanian revolution, we adopted an open position. 
We considered that all Romanians, regardless of the place where 
they live, essentially are bound to the motherland and cannot 
ignore what is going on in the country. Cultural connections 
with the motherland, with the national culture, and with the 
mother tongue are normal for every person. And our duty is to 
remain open and reach out with a helping hand to all Romanians, 
regardless of the place where they live, closer or farther from 
our country. We have proclaimed this as a policy of the 
Romanian state. 
  In a way, I am familiar with the activity of the Romanians 
in 
Vojvodina. I visited Novi Sad a few times, your publishing house 
and the radio and television stations. I held meetings with 
representatives of the Romanian community. I think that the 
Romanians in Vojvodina, generally speaking, have had a good 
situation. They have enjoyed a certain recognition and it is 
also their merit that they knew how to assert their existence, 
their being, culture, and language. They became artisans and 
their cultural work became part of the present Romanian cultural 
heritage. There have been good relations between our writers as 
well. 
  I believe that other Romanians in the same area, such as 
the Vlachs in the Timoc River Valley, have a more difficult 
situation. I recently heard somebody's theory that the 
nationality of the Vlachs should not be recognized. Tara 
Romaneasca [southern part of Romania, former province of 
Wallachia] formerly was called Wallachia. The name Wallachia 
comes from the Serb term for Romanians, that is Vlachs or 
Wallachs. Thus the Vlachs are Romanians. That is the term that 
Slavs used for Romanians, Vlachs or Wallachs. Thus, the Vlachs 
in the Timoc Valley are Romanians, just as much Romanians as the 
Romanians in Vojvodina or Romanians in Romania. 
  However, they had a much more bitter situation because they 
were completely isolated from Romania. I believe that it is the 
common duty of Romania and of the Serbian Yugoslav state to 
assist these Romanians to regain their dignity and their right 
to exist, to assert themselves, and to assert their national 
culture. 
  As a matter of fact, we promote a policy that I believe is 
correct, honest, and open toward all countries that have 
Romanian minorities. We regard our minorities not as Romania's 
agents on the territory of other countries but as fellow 
nationals. But, as citizens of another country, they have to be 
loyal to the state whose citizens they are, just as we regard 
all citizens of Romania with the same openness, and grant them 
equal rights with Romanians, regardless of their nationality. 
All ethnic minorities in our country are treated by the 
Romanian state, in the current new democratic situation, with 
understanding. We grant them all our support. On this basis, 
I believe we can forge relations of good neighborliness with all 
countries and with our co-nationals. Thus, we believe that it 
is our duty to preserve these cultural relations and grant all 
the support we can to preserve the Romanian being and culture. 
  [Stoianovici] At the end of this interview, if you will 
allow me, I would like to ask you one more question: Do you 
have any message for the Romanians in Vojvodina? 
  [Iliescu] I wish both the Romanians as well as the Serb 
people and the Yugoslav peoples to overcome first of all these 
difficult times and the present state of conflict in the 
Yugoslav area and to reinstate a normal situation. On this 
basis, I wish for the resumption of normal, natural neighborly 
relations and of economic relations between our countries that 
have been affected very much. The embargo is not only directed 
against Yugoslavia, it is also against Romania, Bulgaria, 
Hungary, and the other neighboring countries. We all suffer 
because of it. Thus, first of all we wish that a normal 
situation be reestablished and, on this basis, cultural life, a 
full intellectual life, with complete use of creative capacities 
our nations should be able to develop.

<F P=106> [Appeal by the Union of Democratic Forces National </F>
Coordinating Council: "Blue Coalition Appeals for Joint Actions 
by All Democratic Organizations"; issued at meeting on 21 June] 
  [Text] After the people's vote of October 1991 was 
distorted and after the exhaustion of the possibilities of the 
parliamentary faction of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS], 
which was forced to become an opposition force and which for 18 
months has defended the positions of the SDS, the SDS no longer 
finds any reason for its parliamentary faction to participate in 
the work of this parliament. With its actions the parliamentary 
majority is destroying the notion of parliamentarianism, 
democracy, and constitutionalism, and alienates Bulgarian 
citizens from participating in political life. 
  The SDS warns of the danger of turning the Bulgarian 
parliament, controlled by the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] 
and its satellites, into a machine for recommunizing the country 
and returning to the methods of the communist dictatorship which 
existed for 50 years. 
  The pro-communist government of irresponsibility has caused 
mass poverty, raging crime, and moral deterioration, and has 
brought Bulgaria to the brink of a catastrophe. Lyuben Berov's 
cabinet has displayed extremely unworthy political behavior, 
which has compromised the basic principles of democracy. 
  In this fateful situation the only solution for Bulgaria is 
in holding early parliamentary elections in the autumn of 1994. 
These elections will give a clear four-year mandate to a worthy 
political force, which will assume responsibility for 
stabilizing and reviving Bulgaria, which is in a grave economic 
and moral crisis. 
  The SDS refuses to participate in political haggling or in 
forming a new cabinet within the framework of this parliament. 
  The SDS calls upon all the other political forces and 
parliamentary factions who declared their readiness to support 
early parliamentary elections to declare their clear refusal to 
support Lyuben Berov's cabinet, and participate in or support 
forming a new cabinet. 
  The SDS will continue to boycott the parliamentary sessions 
until the moment the National Assembly demonstrates a clear 
willingness to call early elections in the autumn. 
  The SDS is prepared to face the voters and assume 
responsibility for saving the country. 
  We call upon all democratic forces that share the SDS's 
principles and policy documents to carry out joint actions to 
save Bulgaria.

<F P=106> ["24 CHASA" staff report: "Athens Wants Kozloduy Nuclear </F>
Power Plant Closed Down"] 
  [Text] Greece will make an official demand for Bulgaria to 
shut down the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. This will happen at 
an international conference that will seek the European Union's 
blessing for the initiative, according to a statement made 
yesterday by Kiriakos Domadzoglu [name as transliterated], a 
member of the conference's organizing committee. 
  The conference will be held from 29 June to 3 July in the 
town of Drama and will cost almost 9 million leva, at the 
exchange rate fixed by the Bulgarian National Bank. The 
sponsors include Siemens and Philips Greece. 
  The poster advertising the conference showed a boiler shaped 
like Bulgaria that belched out smoke, turning the sun into a 
black sphere. 
  The idea of holding the conference has reportedly received 
support from the Greek Ministry of National Economy, the 
Secretariat General of Makedonia-Thraki, and the councils of the 
eight largest towns in the province. 
  Ecological movements in Greece have reportedly asked that 
the 
European Union close down the Bulgarian nuclear plant. The 
conference will deliver an ultimatum to the cabinet in Athens to 
raise the matter with the Berov government. 
  "Kozloduy is a potential threat to the Balkans," Mr. 
Domadzoglu said, but admitted that he is not familiar with the 
official report of the International Atomic Energy Agency on 
Kozloduy, which is complimentary about the nuclear plant's 
condition. 
  However, the Greeks are reported to be in a state of stress 
over Kozloduy. At a meeting, a special group of Greek 
parliamentarians is reported to have invited Bulgarian 
Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski to support the 
conference. However, our ecologists protested against the title 
of the conference -- "International Conference on Kozloduy," so 
there will be no official participants from Bulgaria. 
  Nevertheless, some Bulgarian scientists are said to have 
responded to the invitations, and they will present three papers 
in Drama. One of them, by Ivan Uzunov, a genetics professor, is 
entitled "No Prospects Exist in Bulgaria for Nuclear Energy 
Development." 
  "If Greece has rejected nuclear power plants," this does not 
entitle it to make us follow their example, said Nikita 
Shervashidze, chairman of the Committee on Power Supply. "In 
the long run, we will teach them what kind of olive trees to 
plant."

  [Text] Kranj, 18 June -- History is being made today as the 
Slovene Army is about to step on Austrian soil without 
commotion. The "Chamois" (so named for their unit insignia) from 
Upper Carniola will not be there as a purely military force but 
to cooperate with the 7th Chasseur Brigade from Klagenfurt, 
thereby contributing to good relations between the two states. 
  Ten privates and 22 commissioned and noncommissioned 
officers 
will take part in the 48-km long Rosenthal March. This is the 
first time that Slovene uniformed army personnel are 
participating in such an event abroad. 
  Next week, 16 Hungarian officers will arrive at Bohinjska 
Bela to familiarize themselves with tactics and the use of 
mountain and alpine equipment in mountainous terrain. Although 
mountainous warfare is not especially developed in Hungary, this 
kind of training is a valuable form of international cooperation 
(in keeping with the saying "Hungary does not have a sea, 
however, it does have a navy"). Our excellent alpinists will 
take part in training, which will culminate in our Hungarian 
guests "capturing" Mount Triglav.

  [Text] Skopje, 27 Jun (TANJUG) -- The council of the second 
municipal court in Skopje, chaired by Ljubomir Jovevski, today 
pronounced sentences on a group of Albanians who took part in 
organizing paramilitary formations in Macedonia [FYROM -- The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and smuggling arms via 
Albania. The court passed sentences between five and eight years 
in jail. 
  The defendants have been sentenced for associating in order 
to engage in hostile activity. Mithat Emini, secretary general 
of the PDP [Party of Democratic Prosperity] with headquarters in 
Tetovo and Hasan Agusi, were sentenced to eight years in jail. 
Ejupi Rezni, Selam Elmazi, and Sinasi Redzepi to seven years in 
jail; Husein Haskaj, Macedonian deputy defense minister, Akif 
Demiri, and Abdiselam Arslani to six years in jail; and Burim 
Murtezani and Eugen Cami to five years in jail. Agusi will be 
expelled from Macedonia after his term in jail. 
  Under the indictment, all of the accused associated to 
engage 
in hostile activity, and they had clear aims and tasks to topple 
the fledgling Macedonian state. Emini, Agusi, and Haskaj were 
the ringleaders in this hostile activity. 
  The indictment says that the accused formed "a HQ of 
national 
defense," and Emini was candidate for the commander. They set 
up a state-of-the-art computer center and had a courier service 
in operation. They also began to draw up a program of setting 
up paramilitary units in Kumanovo and towns in western Macedonia.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "NDP Proposing Federalization of </F>
Macedonia"] 
  [Text] The annual conference of the National Democratic 
Party [NDP] (ethnic Albanians) held in Tetovo last Saturday [25 
June] finished with an adoption of a 9-point memorandum. NDP is 
not satisfied with the democratic processes going on in 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], 
particularly since the disintegration of Yugoslavia. This party 
is emphasizing that the Albanian people have been deprived of 
the right for self- orientation, although they are the third 
largest nation in the former Yugoslavia. 
  The memorandum condemns the manipulations by the government 
in relation to the census of the population. The NDP concludes 
that these manipulations are aimed at discrediting the Albanian 
political factor before the international institutions, as well 
as its further splitting apart. 
  The NDP underlined the government's responsibility for the 
further building up and functioning of the state and community 
institutions on a one-national basis. This, the NDP believes, 
legalizes the political discrediting and tolerance of the 
advents of neofascism. Otherwise, the NDP is pushing for a 
federalization of Macedonia and the formation of an autonomous 
region Ilirida in Macedonia. 
  Guests from the PDP fraction were also present at the 
conference, as well as representatives from the Demo-Christian 
Party of Kosovo and the Democratic Party and Social Democratic 
Party from Albania.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Census 1994"] </F>
  [Text] Even five days after the census began, the situation 
has not essentially changed, especially in regions inhabited 
mostly by Albanians (Tetovo, Gostivar). Communal census 
instructors and clerks are still awaiting their political 
leaders' views before they go out and do their job. Local 
census committees insist on having only Albanian census clerks 
in "pure ethnic regions." Due to the delay, they also request 
postponement of the operation for as many days as it has thus 
far been put off. 
  The census is carried out normally in all remaining cities. 
As the Macedonian television reports, the State Statistics 
Institute informs that 338,599 citizens, 98,593 households, 
104,155 apartments and 39,430 farms have been registered up to 
June 29, inclusive. Parallel with the census in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is the census of 
Macedonians throughout the world who have valid documents, 
regardless of the date of issuance. This operation is carried 
out in 10 foreign countries in which Macedonia has diplomatic 
offices, in three countries in which it has only representative 
offices, and all countries whose authorities gave permission for 
the census to be realized. Reports from these countries 
indicate a need of prolonging the deadline. Some sources inform 
Macedonian citizens of Albanian origin in Switzerland and 
Germany have announced their intention to boycott the census. 
No census of Macedonians was allowed in Federal Yugoslavia by 
the authorities there.

  [Text] Starting 1 July, the traffic between Albania and 
Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] 
will be facilitated -- drivers will only be required transport 
licenses. This was agreed on in Ohrid, during the recent 
meeting between road traffic experts of the Albanian Ministry 
for Transport and Communication and the Macedonian Ministry of 
City Planning, Construction, Traffic, and Ecology. All 
Macedonian transporting firms will be exempted from paying road 
taxes and tolls. The first contingent of 5,000 transportation 
licenses, bilateral and transit, as well as 100 licenses for 
transportation to and from third countries, is already being 
distributed. 
  At the Ohrid meeting, the two sides also signed a draft 
agreement on international transport of passengers and goods 
through both countries. The agreement was signed in Albanian, 
Macedonian, and English. The Albanian side, however, had 
remarks on the name of Republic of Macedonia being used in the 
text, so they introduced a special clause on the agreement 
coming into effect after the additional consultations on the 
problem.

talks in Sarajevo with Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris 
Silajdzic. After the talks Prime Minister Silajdzic said that 
the external borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot be haggled 
over and cannot be the subject of any political negotiations. 
According to him, this message was clearly conveyed to the 
Italian foreign minister. It was stressed that only an internal 
transformation of Bosnia-Herzegovina can be discussed. 
  The Italian minister said that he has come to Sarajevo to 
conduct preparations for the September meeting of G-7 and Russia 
[in Naples]. He did not comment on the current proposals on the 
resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but said that 
the situation will be discussed in detail at the Naples meeting.

<F P=106> [Report by Stevo Latinovic on the talks between </F>
Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Italian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in Sarajevo on 27 June -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Latinovic] The visit by the Italian minister is 
part of a several-day tour in the furtherance of peace of the 
former Yugoslavia, so that Minister Martino's itinerary covers 
not only Sarajevo but also Zagreb and Belgrade. Apart from 
Prime Minister Silajdzic, today's talks were also attended by 
Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic and Mariofil Ljubic, deputy 
chairman of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and chairman of the 
Constituent Assembly. 
  At the end of the talks, Antonio Martino and Dr. Haris 
Silajdzic gave statements. 
  [Martino in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] This is my first visit to your country. I was 
looking forward to visiting Sarajevo to see for myself the marks 
of war on this city. I wanted to meet the prime minister as 
soon as possible, to exchange views, and to find out what the 
perspective is for a complete and satisfactory solution to this 
crisis. I have now been informed about the views held by the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Government as to the solution to the crisis 
and the end of the war in the entire region. 
  We also discussed the coming summit of the G-7 in Naples. A 
constructive and satisfactory debate is expected to take place 
there on the Bosnian problem. 
  I look forward to coming to this city again in more peaceful 
times. 
  [Silajdzic] We are pleased to have received today the 
delegation of the Italian Government led by the foreign minister. 
  I will very briefly tell you what we discussed. Of course, 
we discussed peace and the work of the contact group. As for 
the contact group and the solutions that it will offer, we said 
that, first and foremost, the external borders of the Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a 1000-year-old state cannot be open to 
discussion. What is open to discussion, what the contact group 
is doing, is the internal reorganization of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  We added that the international community should not 
legitimize genocide as [words indistinct]. We said that we 
expected the international community to protect the external 
borders of Bosnia-Herzegovina with Serbia and Montenegro. That 
is where the main problem lies. We also said that we expected a 
lot from the coming G-7 summit in Naples on 8 July. These are 
countries that are the most responsible for the world order. 
Order cannot be maintained if aggression is allowed, if change 
of borders is allowed, if genocide is allowed, and so on. 
Therefore, we expect a lot from the Italian Government, we 
expect it to contribute to that summit, we expect it to give a 
constructive contribution. We have to turn a new page in 
history, to (enter a period) in which genocide and aggression 
will not be possible. 
  [Latinovic] Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino then 
went for a walk in the city. After that he was received by Dr. 
Mustafa Efendi Ceric, reis ul-ulema of the Islamic Community of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina and its future market are 
becoming interesting for certain states that would like to take 
part in the country's reconstruction. Our correspondent 
Aleksander Mlac will tell us what Slovenia's place in this is 
and what attitude Sarajevo has toward our state: 
  [Begin Mlac recording] Bosnia-Herzegovina will never forget 
the positive attitude the state of Slovenia and the Slovenes 
have held on the crisis in our country. This is what Dr. Haris 
Silajdzic, prime minister in the Government of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and of the Bosnian-Croatian Federation, said 
in a statement for Slovene radio. He assessed the relations 
between the two states as very good and at the same time pointed 
out that Slovene economy would be welcome in Bosnia, which has 
already begun preparations for the reconstruction. 
  Prime Minister Silajdzic also pointed out that the 
international competition on the Bosnian market is more 
satisfactory day by day. In an one-hour statement he made for 
Slovene Radio, among other things, Dr.Haris Silajdzic touched 
upon the refugee issue. He cannot promise Bosnian refugees a 
quick return home. One needs many preconditions for such a 
thing, above all peace. 
  Silajdzic sees peace between Bosniaks and Croats as the 
greatest achievement of the Bosnian-Croatian Federation. What 
is involved is a necessary compromise that has saved many lives. 
He sees the new government as not being burdened by party 
affiliations, being an expert body. [end recording]

  [Text] Fikret Abdic, the president of the autonomous 
province of western Bosnia [APWB], told Velkaton Radio in Velika 
Kladusa this morning that the army of the autonomous province of 
western Bosnia is objectively not able to prove to the world the 
justness of its struggle against the brutal aggression of the 
rebel army loyal to Izetbegovic's authorities. Slavisa Sabljic 
has a report. 
  [Sabljic] Abdic said that the idea of autonomy was supported 
by Muslims in the diaspora, but not by the diplomatic 
authorities in Sarajevo which, via their primitive sympathizers, 
have opted for the war and the bloody quenching of our army's 
struggle for its own province and autonomy. The ignominious 
action and the rebels' offensive that began on 10 June had been 
prepared for months, Abdic went on to say and stressed that the 
offensive's final aim was to strangulate the province and 
liquidate the province's leaders. However, Abdic said, it is 
impossible to strangulate the province, there can only arise an 
all-people's resistance front, which we will organize. 
  Stressing the fabrications, media madness, and the lies that 
certain media spread to the international public, Abdic said at 
the end of his interview on Velkaton Radio that the REUTER 
agency blazed the trail in spreading lies about Muslim conflicts 
in the province. A REUTER team of journalists will soon arrive 
in Kladusa in order to, as Abdic put it, deny their own reports.

  [Text] Banja Luka, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The offensive of 
Moslem troops loyal to hardliner Alija Izetbegovic against the 
rebel Moslem autonomous province of western Bosnia is designed 
to stifle all life in the province and liquidate its leadership, 
says province President Fikret Abdic. 
  Abdic, Izetbegovic's moderate rival, told the local radio 
Velika Kladusa that he would organise a nation-wide resistance 
front against Izetbegovic's loyalists. He accused the Moslem 
regime in Sarajevo of a determination to crush the struggle of 
the army and people of western Bosnia for autonomy, which he 
said enjoyed the support of Moslems in the diaspora. 
  For months past, the army loyal to Izetbegovic has been 
trying to subdue the province, which was proclaimed by Abdic's 
supporters last September in opposition to the war-mongering 
policy of the regime in Sarajevo. The provincial leadership has 
signed separate peace accords with Bosnian Serbs and Croats, 
pursuing free trade with them even at the height of Moslem-Serb 
and Moslem-Croat fighting elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>
  [Text] The defense lines on the Bihac and Bosanska Krupa 
fronts as well as on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau have been 
exposed to incessant Chetnik shelling and sniper fire. 
  As for the members of Abdic's traitor phalange, there has 
been no change from the usual, despite the successive defeats 
suffered by that rebel scum. Last night they launched barbaric 
attacks straight after Fikret Abdic -- in the steps of his hero 
Radovan Karadzic -- announced some sort of a counteroffensive. 
From Liskovac, Rosic, and (Crkva), they have been shelling the 
newly liberated areas in the Cazin and Kladusa municipalities 
and, from the Kladusa area, they have been pounding with mortars 
and cannons (Golubovici), [words indistinct]. An entire 
sabotage group was captured during these attacks. 
  Abdic's warmongering headquarters has continued to arrest 
citizens in Velika Kladusa, and to terrorize them. Another 
request has been sent to international organizations for help in 
their protection, since these are people who do not want war and 
who reject the insane ideas of the self-proclaimed Kladusa 
leader.

    [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0800 GMT on 28 June within its 
regular 5-minute newscast carries several reports about the 
situation in the republic. 
  A report by the 3d Corps Press Center read by an 
unidentified 
correspondent says that "Karadzic's threats that he will use 
full force and all means to attack the region defended by the 
units of the 3d Corps of the Army of the Republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are coming true. The chetniks have been 
furiously assaulting the Zavidovici, [name indistinct], and the 
(?Tesanj)-Doboj defense lines." The report goes on to say that 
"throughout the day until late last night, [words indistinct] 
Chetniks were launching combined (?artillery)-infantry 
(?breakthroughs) with [word indistinct] defense positions on the 
Zavidovici front." "At about 1700, the chetniks began attacking 
in waves. Tanks were (?deployed) at the front. Chemical agents 
were discharged at our lines at (Mratinci). The chetniks (?were 
using) all available artillery, but everything was in vain." 
  "The chetnik artillery and (?infantry) were [word 
indistinct] 
on the Tesanj-Doboj region. A particularly large concentration 
of tanks has been observed in the region of (Gaganovici). The 
chetniks are preparing to attack our defense lines today, as a 
train full of fresh soldiers arrived in [name indistinct] 
yesterday." 
  A report by the Information Service of the 1st [word 
indistinct] of the 8th Mountain Brigade sent via the 1st Corps 
Press Center says that "on the Olovo front yesterday evening, 
the aggressor brought all his weapons and artillery into play. 
There was particularly fierce fire from infantry weapons, 
antiaircraft machine guns, and antiaircraft guns in the regions 
of Kozlovac, (Gradina), [name indistinct], Salikovac, and Golo 
Brdo. The defense lines and the suburbs were shelled at the 
same time. Early this morning, the defense lines came under 
attack from a battery of mortars (words indistinct] in the 
(Salikovac) region. There have been no casualties." 
  Hamiz Deronjic reports from the Brcko region that "early 
yesterday evening, the aggressor began mortar activities on the 
Brcko defense positions. Our lines at (Jukici), (name 
indistinct], and the central sector of the front were pounded. 
At the same time, the chetniks intensified their small arms 
fire at the [word indistinct] line of the front. The early 
morning hours saw no significant changes on the Brcko front. 
The strongest provocations occurred in the Vranovaca region, 
where the chetniks were operating with submachine guns and 
Broving guns."

  [Text] Zvornik, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Moslem forces 
have continued attacks on Bosnian Serb positions, further 
violating the one-month ceasefire that took effect on June 10, 
Bosnian Serb Army sources told TANJUG on Monday [27 June]. They 
said the heaviest Moslem attacks in the past 24 hours were in 
the areas of Doboj, Mt. Ozren in northern Bosnia and Mt. Vlasic 
in the central part of that former Yugoslav republic. 
  Early on Monday, Moslems opened artillery fire on Doboj, a 
strategically important Serb town in the Bosna River valley, 
with sporadic mortar shellings of Serb positions in the areas of 
Trebava, Mt. Ozren, Teslic and Gradacac around Doboj. Moslems 
also continued attacks on Serb positions and settlements near 
the Serb town of Brcko on the Sava River. 
  Moslems are still launching infantry attacks on Serb 
settlements of Ilidza, Nedzarici and Ilijas in the Sarajevo 
area, Bosnian Serb Army sources said. Bosnian Croats violated 
the ceasefire in the area of the Croat enclave of Orasje in 
northern Bosnia, where combined Bosnian Croat and Croatian Army 
troops are firing at Serb positions from small arms as well as 
anti-aircraft guns and mortars. 
  Croats also renewed attacks in the area between Dubrovnik 
and 
the Serb town of Trebinje in the Dubrovnik hinterland in 
southern Bosnia-Herzegovina.

  [Text] Belgrade, 27 Jun (TANJUG) -- A group of 260 Serbs 
from Zenica crossed to the territory of the republic of Srpska 
at border crossing in Cekrcici around 2030 this evening. The 
convoy was delayed eight hours because, as the released Serbs 
from Zenica said, the Muslim soldiers redirected the vehicles 
from the main road to travel through the Lasva river canyon 
where the Serbian civilians were maltreated and robbed. 
Following a short breather in Ilijas, as SRNA news agency has 
reported, the Serbian civilians around 2200 set off in vehicles 
of Canadian UNPROFOR battalion towards a reception centre in 
Sokolac.

Alija Izetbegovic, by unidentified KURIER correspondent in 
Sarajevo; date not given: "`If the Serbs Do Not Withdraw, We 
Will Liberate Ourselves'"] 
  [Text] [KURIER] Is the Muslim-Croat Federation working? 
  [Muftic] Yes, it is working well. The fighting between the 
two armies has been reduced. It is not easy to defend Bosnia 
because the destruction was well prepared. But we believe in 
Bosnia. 
  [KURIER] In the United Nations' plans, the Federation is 
based on 51 percent of the territory. But you have only 30 
percent.... 
  [Muftic] Bosnia does not mean 51 percent, but 100 percent. 
  [KURIER] The Federation only includes the Muslims and 
Croats. Would you consider yourself represented by it if you 
were a loyal Serb? 
  [Muftic] Yes. The Serbs must understand the political 
realities. The Federation is a political process that has 
stabilized the situation. Now Karadzic's Serbs cannot make any 
more conquests. The war has turned from a war of defense into 
one of liberation. The army is getting larger every day, morale 
is high -- but logistics are lacking. 
  [KURIER] The Bosnians want to achieve a lifting of the arms 
embargo. Would this not mean another outbreak of war? 
  [Muftic] It was the imbalance of forces that led to the war. 
Without the embargo we could have stopped the aggression right 
at the beginning. 
  [KURIER] Do you want to liberate the territories occupied by 
the Serbs? 
  [Muftic] The Serbs only understand the language of violence. 
Either the aggressor's army withdraws -- or we will liberate 
ourselves. If the international community does not stop the 
Serbs, we will have no other choice. 
  [KURIER] Is there a Bosnian ultimatum to the international 
community? 
  [Muftic] That is top secret.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Jana </F>
Pankovcinova and Alica Strbava; place and date not given: "Will 
Party of the Democratic Left Deputy Juraj Plesnik Become 
Minister Milan Janicina's State Secretary?"] 
  [Text] [SME] Will your government hold out in its present 
form until the end of its electoral term? 
  [Moravcik] It should. I will do everything I can for it to 
hold out. 
  [SME] Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] deputies in the 
parliamentary privatization committee have called on 
Privatization Minister Milan Janicina to resign. Several 
coalition meetings have discussed this issue. Is the possible 
appointment of SDL Deputy Juraj Plesnik as second state 
secretary at the Ministry of Privatization not too big a 
compromise, from the viewpoint of the other coalition parties? 
Or is the coalition not confident enough with regard to 
privatization issues? 
  [Moravcik] We have not noticed any differences with regard 
to the privatization concept. There are certain differences in 
views on the privatization of specific companies, but we have 
always been successful in removing those differences. I am 
making use of my coordinating function in the government to 
achieve this. I consider the establishment of the post of a 
second state secretary at the Ministry of Privatization to be an 
effective solution that is in the interest of harmonization of 
views. Having two state secretaries in a government department 
that is of such importance and must cope with such an enormous 
work load as the Ministry of Privatization is nothing 
extraordinary. 
  [SME] Your claim of there being unanimity of views on the 
privatization concept could be contested. The SDL is supported 
by the Union of Industry, which is opposed to the privatization 
of state enterprises by means of coupon privatization. Former 
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar had promised representatives of 
the Union of Industry that 10 to 12 percent of the companies' 
shares would be reserved for their managers, which Mr. Janicina 
does not accept. Besides, Mr. Plesnik said in the Privatization 
Committee that he could not accept Milan Janicina as minister, 
in view of the latter's past mistakes. Will conflicts not arise 
when Juraj Plesnik, as state secretary, has to subordinate 
himself to Minister Janicina? 
  [Moravcik] If he accepts the position, he will have to 
respect the minister. When I spoke about the privatization 
concept, I was thinking of its form as set out in the 
government's policy statement. No one has called this concept 
in question. As for other issues--that is, whether the 
management ought to have 5 or 10 percent of shares--that is a 
matter that can be assessed and does not contradict the 
privatization concept. 
  [SME] Could you clarify the course of the coalition talks 
about the possibility of appointing Juraj Plesnik as state 
secretary at the Ministry of Privatization? 
  [Moravcik] The Coalition Council has not discussed this 
issue. 
  [SME] Has it been discussed at the level of the coalition 
parties' chairmen? 
  [Moravcik] The party chairmen discussed the course of 
privatization in light of the government statement. 
  [SME] We asked about the assessment of personnel issues. 
What arguments were put forward at the level of party chairmen? 
Was the possibility of appointing Viliam Vaskovic, deputy 
chairman of your party [Democratic Union], as minister of 
privatization raised? 
  [Moravcik] So far we have not reached the conclusion that 
there is a need for a change in the post of minister of 
privatization. That is what matters. 
  [SME] But the SDL deputies took concerted action when 
raising objections to Milan Janicina in the Privatization 
Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic on 22 
June.... 
  [Moravcik] As far as personnel issues are concerned, there 
must be agreement from all coalition parties [before any 
appointments or dismissals are made]. 
  [SME] In other words, there will be a compromise in that 
Juraj Plesnik will become state secretary and the rest of the 
coalition will not raise the issue of the minister of economy, 
of whom it is generally rumored that his screening certificate 
is not quite in order and who has not submitted to the public a 
negative screening certificate to dispel those rumors.... 
  [Moravcik] I cannot act on the basis of general rumors. That 
would be against the law. The replacement of [Economy Minister] 
Mr. Magvasi is out of the question and has never been 
considered. We have no legal or other reason to establish a link 
between those matters. 
  [SME] Did you, at the meeting of chairmen of coalition 
parties, consider Mr. Vaskovic as a possible minister of 
privatization? Is our information correct? 
  [Moravcik] Because there is no consensus that any member of 
the government should be replaced, I cannot confirm this. 
  [SME] Has this name been mentioned as that of a possible 
candidate? 
  [Moravcik] I do not consider this relevant. 
  [SME] The opposition makes no secret of the fact that it 
will once again raise the issue of Minister Janicina and will 
try to have him recalled from his post. Do you believe that the 
SDL will unequivocally confirm his remaining in his post? 
  [Moravcik] You have to ask the SDL. I do not see any reason 
that this issue should be raised.

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner by Julius </F>
Gembicky; place and date not given: "Is There a Shadow 
Intelligence Service?"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday we published an interview with 
Jaroslav Svechota about the suspected existence of a parallel or 
shadow intelligence service, focusing on gathering information 
about representatives of the government coalition. We were 
proceeding from information provided by Ludovit Cernak, deputy 
chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic [NRSR], 
to SLOVENSKY VYCHOD. Yesterday we asked Mr. Cernak for his 
comment on the interview with Jaroslav Svechota. 
  [Cernak] I tend to stand behind what I say. That is also 
why I tend to formulate my statements carefully. At that time, 
I said in reply to a specific question: "You are on the right 
track." Today I can only add a few words to my reply: "Explore 
the matter further." 
  We also asked Interior Minister Pittner for his comment: 
  [Gembicky] Mr. Pittner, there are certain indications that 
an intelligence agency engaged in the gathering of material 
against representatives of the government coalition is active in 
Slovakia. Can you confirm or deny this suspicion? 
  [Pittner] Such activity is inadmissible under the law. But, 
because there exists a shadow cabinet, an adventurer could 
perhaps be found to set up such an agency. However, this is a 
matter to be dealt with by the Slovak Information Service [SIS] 
and not by the Ministry of the Interior. 
  [Gembicky] The most charming thing about the whole affair is 
that, according to these indications, Mr. XY, one of the leading 
SIS officials, is supposed to be a collaborator in this private 
agency. (We obviously gave his name to the minister, but we 
cannot publish it for the time being.) It is probably not very 
realistic to expect [SIS Director] Mr. Mitro's employee to 
disclose himself.... 
  [Pittner] I repeat that supervision of SIS is not within the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior. A special NRSR 
commission has been established for its supervision, which is 
chaired by Mr. Ivan Gasparovic. 
  [Gembicky] Would you consider it appropriate for us to turn 
to him with these suspicions? 
  [Pittner] Certainly. 
  [Gembicky] So yesterday we sent a fax to NRSR Chairman Ivan 
Gasparovic, who chairs the Special Supervisory Commission for 
SIS, asking him to reply to the question of whether the 
commission has availed itself of the information that one of the 
leading SIS officials is working for a private intelligence 
agency. 
  We will publish his reply as soon as we receive it. 
  We are thus taking seriously NRSR Deputy Chairman Ludovit 
Cernak's recommendation: "Explore the matter further."

<F P=106> [Article by Milan Kurucz, "expert on international relations </F>
at the Bratislava Institute of Strategic Studies": "Rationally 
and Without Emotions"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that the victory of the Hungarian 
Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ) in the most recent parliamentary elections has raised no 
small expectations in neighboring countries, including Slovakia. 
The preelection declarations of the Hungarian Socialists and 
liberals, as well as their election programs, signaled a 
substantially different policy toward the surrounding countries, 
different from that of the Antall and Boross government, under 
the tutorship of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF). 
  The Socialist and liberals, instead of making complicated 
maneuvers around the problem of the borders, as interpreted by 
the MDF, have sufficiently clearly formulated their standpoint 
rejecting any revision of the existing borders in Central 
Europe. The future coalition partners, both of them, have 
simultaneously distanced themselves from the so-called Antall 
doctrine, according to which the problem of the Hungarian 
minorities was more important than organizing and developing 
relations with the neighboring countries. Its implementation 
has reduced Hungary's interstate relations in Central Europe 
almost exclusively to the problem of minorities, which obviously 
complicated bilateral and multilateral contacts in the entire 
region. 
  Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ are building on the idea that 
the 
best way to support the Hungarian minorities abroad is to 
improve relations with the neighboring countries and thus create 
an atmosphere of mutual trust between them and Hungary. This 
would mean that a turnabout toward better relations may take 
place even in Slovak-Hungarian relations, including the signing 
of a basic treaty between the two countries. 
  However, it would be erroneous to expect that this will be a 
simple process without problems. On the contrary. We have to 
examine and evaluate attentively, rationally, and without 
unnecessary emotions all of the obstacles that the normalization 
of interstate relations between Slovakia and Hungary might 
encounter. 
  Even though it is possible to expect that the 
"proportionalization" of the Hungarian minorities problem (that 
is, reduce its inflated proportions compared with other goals), 
in addition to cleansing it of irredentist nostalgia, will 
become one of the priorities of Hungarian foreign policy, it is 
more than likely that, in the understanding of this problem, 
there will be differences between Hungary on one side and 
Slovakia or Romania on the other. 
  The Socialists, who are most likely to take over the Foreign 
Ministry in the coalition government, have based their election 
program on the fact that the basic treaties with the neighboring 
states, as well as the principle of the inviolability of 
existing borders, should also contain mutual obligations 
regarding securing the ethnic minorities' rights in line with 
European standards and international documents on safeguarding 
the rights of ethnic minorities. Both the MSZP and the SZDSZ 
are building on the equality of individual and collective rights 
of minorities, which will certainly not meet with great 
understanding on the part of their future partners. 
  The search for mutually acceptable ways out and formulations 
regarding the problems of minorities' rights will be greatly 
complicated, above all, by the fact that both new government 
parties consider the right to autonomy to be a decisive part and 
parcel of collective rights. In their program, the Socialists 
have elaborated their autonomy concept in very minute detail. 
They consider several forms of autonomy, starting with cultural 
autonomy and ending with territorial autonomy, while the process 
of its establishment is understood as a process that should go 
through several stages. Most essential is the fact, however, 
that both the Socialists and liberal democrats have pledged to 
push for the demand of autonomy for Hungarian minorities as for 
right corresponding to European standards. 
  Even today it has become obvious that this will be one of 
the 
most complicated points in future talks between the new 
Hungarian Government and its Central European partners because 
their negative stance on autonomy (above all, territorial 
autonomy) is generally known. 
  The new Hungarian Government, when discussing basic treaties 
with Slovakia and other neighbors, will also have to count on a 
very cautious attitude of most West European countries and 
European international organizations toward the problem of the 
collective rights of minorities. Their definition is contained 
neither in the Vienna Declaration of the Council of Europe nor 
in the document from the Stability Pact initial conference, 
which was also signed by Hungary. The negotiating position of 
Hungary will not be so easy. 
  MSZP and SZDSZ representatives have several times expressed 
their willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue with 
Hungary's neighbors. Today, the first signs of a positive 
change taking place in the atmosphere of Slovak-Hungarian 
relations have begun to appear. This is an important 
prerequisite for searching for a mutually acceptable compromise 
in such a complicated problem as minorities and securing their 
rights. However, the way to this compromise will certainly be 
neither easy nor short.

<F P=106> [Article by "dos": "Hungarian Civic Party's Conditions for a </F>
Coalition"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--L. Nagy, chairman of the Hungarian 
Civic Party [MOS], yesterday made public MOS's conditions for 
entering into a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition with 
the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] and 
Coexistence. They include, first and foremost, a general 
screening of candidates in accordance with the screening law, 
the candidates' sworn statement that they will not have any 
other income besides their deputies' salaries, a joint electoral 
manifesto, the Hungarian deputies' unanimous voting on all 
important issues pertaining to the minorities, the publication 
of concluded agreements, and the banning of campaigning against 
the other coalition members. According to Nagy, during the 
negotiations, MOS will demand, as a starting point, a 25-percent 
share on the common slate of candidates, which would correspond 
to the outcome of the last parliamentary elections. As MOS 
spokesman K. Petocz went on to say, MOS tried to initiate talks 
on a three-member coalition as early as February so as not to be 
pressed for time. This has now happened, according to Nagy, 
despite the fact that MOS's ideas about a coalition are not too 
different from the ideas of the MKDH and Coexistence. Nagy has 
detected a certain shift in the Coexistence movement because the 
latest statement by its Executive Committee no longer contains 
the toughest conditions originally laid down by Coexistence for 
talks with MOS.

  [Excerpts] The Republican Council of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] held a session at Stara Lesna in the 
High Tatras today. It discussed the current political 
situation, preparation for the parliamentary elections, and 
coalition cooperation. Our correspondent Pavol Sveton is on the 
line to report from there: 
  [Sveton] [passage omitted] HZDS Deputy Chairman Sergej 
Kozlik 
said that the HZDS was at present stronger than in 1992. 
Following an agreement with the Farmers Party of Slovakia 
[Rolnicka Strana Slovenska--RSS] on election coalition 
cooperation, the HZDS also counts on cooperation with the Slovak 
National Party [SNS], provided it passes the election threshold, 
as well as with the KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] and the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL]. The HZDS is open to the 
option of cooperating with the Association of the Workers of 
Slovakia [Zdruzenie Robotnikov Slovenska], the Forum of Workers 
[Forum Robotnikov], the Christian Social Union [KSU], and with 
civic associations and interest groups in districts--such as the 
Union of Antifascist Fighters. The HZDS also considers possible 
cooperation with the New Slovakia movement. 
  At a news conference today, it was said that an election 
program was currently being drafted. It should be ready in 
three weeks' time and be capable of addressing every single 
citizen and individual region of Slovakia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Fuele: "Will There Be a Referendum on the </F>
President?"] 
  [Text] There are indications that, during the preelection 
period, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] will 
attempt to organize also a referendum on curtailing the term of 
office of the president of the Republic. This cold calculation 
is, from the standpoint of the the HZDS, actually 
understandable. Relations between the top people in the HZDS and 
Michal Kovac are already such that, after the early 
parliamentary elections, any kind of effective cooperation could 
hardly be expected. Because the HZDS is firmly convinced that it 
will win, it wants the president of the Republic to be someone 
with whom it can manage to cooperate. 
  If we ostensibly digress from this topic, we find that the 
HZDS has similar relations with almost all political entities. 
The only exception is the Slovak National Party [SNS]. However, 
this party has only minimal prospects of gaining seats in the 
parliament. Then there is also part of the Greens, the small 
Farmers' Party, and maybe the KSU [Christian Social Union]. The 
HZDS has already had so many conflicts with the others that 
calculating on a possible coalition would at the same time 
require calculating on amnesia. If the HZDS is now publishing 
advertisements in PRAVDA, it does so only in an effort to turn 
the opinion of Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] adherents away 
from the opinion of the party leadership, which is unequivocally 
against a postelection coalition. 
  The motivation of the current HZDS politics no longer is to 
create a new political reality, but only to adjust to existing 
reality, which is mostly its own doing. The HZDS, whether it 
wants to or not, must go against all, and, at the same time, its 
only chance is that those who want to go together against it 
will splinter. 
  This game was joined by even the president of the Republic. 
He knows that the coming elections, even if they are not 
combined with a referendum on curtailing his term in office, 
will determine whether he stays or does not continue in office. 
For that reason, as well, it can be expected that Michal Kovac 
will become an active participant in the election campaign. For, 
whether he admits it to himself or whether somebody else says 
it, he cannot de jure dissolve the parliament in a time of 
crisis. However, his authority to give a report on the state of 
the Slovak Republic de facto was sufficient to call early 
elections. So that even in those moments when the president 
comports himself in an above-party manner, he can, by leaning 
toward certain values that should apply among decent people, 
influence in many ways the voters' decisions. Vladimir Meciar, 
by attacking the president, robs himself voluntarily of one 
psychological advantage--the Slovak voter intuitively leans 
toward those who are being wronged. Thus far, it was Meciar who 
acted that part; now he is beginning to share it to someone 
else's benefit. 
  No matter how paradoxical it is, the HZDS finds itself in a 
worse situation than Michal Kovac. For the HZDS, this is a 
matter of going for broke. If it makes an attempt to call a 
referendum, there is still time, but this time it will not have 
at its disposal administrative offices; after all, signatures 
were being collected even there. It would be more difficult to 
collect a sufficient number of real signatures, and the only 
thing that could help would be to further stir up the political 
atmosphere. Besides that, among HZDS followers, there are still 
not a few of those, whom even after his conflicts with the 
movement still trust the president of the Republic. If in the 
elections they had to vote in favor of the HZDS and, at the same 
time, with their other vote make a decision on the curtailing of 
the president's term in office, they would be in an unenviable 
situation. And as a result, the HZDS could find itself in an 
unenviable situation as well. The effect created by the 
referendum on the president could have negative consequences on 
the number of votes gained. 
  During the past week, we were able to read in PRAVDA that 
the 
HZDS is advertising for applications to "fill top government 
jobs in the administration of the Slovak Republic." Even though 
this is a remarkable head-start, signaling future changes (to 
speak about purges ahead of time is not proper), maybe the HZDS 
in its foresight should advertise for an appropriate president 
of the Republic and for politicians willing to work with the 
movement. It appears to be the last opportunity to "make" 
friends. So far, the HZDS has had more skill in "splintering" 
them.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Stefan Sugar: "The Unknown Face of Vladimir </F>
Meciar"] 
  [Text] The man who on Friday morning shortly before 1000 
entered the premises of Radio Twist on Salviova Street was 
undoubtedly the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia [HZDS], Vladimir Meciar. But he bore no resemblance to 
the politician who, at gatherings in the Park of Culture and 
Recreation or in the television program "Kroky" [Steps], shocks 
spectators with angry revelations about his political 
sympathizers from the Movement or the coalition. This Meciar, 
who is visibly thinner, is a sympathetic, direct man with a 
cordial smile on his face, who appears to me to be diffident 
rather than aggressive. 
  Before the leader of the opposition enters the soundproof 
booth of the broadcasting studio of Radio Twist to answer 
listeners' questions in an hour-long roundtable, Lubos Machaj, 
program director, greets him and points out the modest premises 
of this modest radio station. Then he gives him the pleasant 
news about the relative strength of listeners who support his 
politics and those who condemn it: it is 50-50. That was 
indicated by the questions phoned in to Radio Twist by 70 
listeners a day before the broadcast. I looked at Meciar, who 
received this information with modest satisfaction. 
  Even before the HZDS chairman accepted the invitation of the 
radio station, we asked him several questions in order to take 
advantage of the situation and not have to talk to him by phone. 
We were interested to know how much truth there is to the rumors 
about the security measures in the HZDS building on Tomasikova 
Street. The shadow prime minister does not deny anything but 
acknowledges only that they accepted four members of the 
security guard. The bullet-proof glass in the windows of his 
office he consigns to the realm of disinformation games. In the 
brief interview, we also touched on the question of tapping 
politicians' telephone conversations, which Ludovit Cermak 
complained about at the meeting of the National Council. 
  "Let them listen in on me all they want," Vladimir Meciar 
declared. "It does not bother me at all. When you have a 
politician who tells everything on radio or television anyway, 
it is really a waste of time." But he nevertheless admits that, 
in the past, during the totalitarian regime, security did tap 
his phone. But because he knew that a recording on tape lasts 
only 45 minutes, he saved the important matters for after this 
time elapsed. (Editor's comment: This is obviously a 
misunderstanding because we know that State Security used the 
so-called endless tapes for tapping phones, which eliminated the 
possibility of missing some of the conversation.) However, the 
interview, which Radio Twist broadcast, could be taped by 
anyone. And certainly his political opponents taped and listened 
to it in order to find out what he learned from his political 
defeat and whether he chose another tactic. It seems to me that 
he did. Not only from what he said, but rather from what he did 
not say. He was not confrontational, he did not thunder at his 
political opponents, he did not threaten with his planned steps, 
and did not accuse his former sympathizers of betrayal. He 
answered questions, even the most stupid ones, calmly, mildly, 
and to the point. He conceded that the HZDS leadership made a 
critical analyzis of the causes of what happened and came to the 
conclusion that the fault was not in the people but in the 
system, so that, in a year or two, this could happen again. 
  Vladimir Meciar realizes that people were already tired of 
the constant political tension, permanent crisis, and a series 
of scandals, and that they welcomed the relative calm that 
filled the Slovak political scene after the change of the 
government. He himself embraced nonconfrontational politics, 
obviously also in order to win over citizens frightened by his 
methods. As he said, "we want to address not only our 
sympathizers, but also those who do not understand us. At this 
time, we are drafting, with a large team of experts, a program 
for the future development of Slovakia. We want to present it to 
the voters for evaluation, and, if they like it, let them vote 
for HZDS; if not, let them choose another alternative. But we 
want to win over voters with our program, not by asserting that 
we are good and the others are bad." 
  In the radio roundtable, Meciar had to listen not only to 
questions from those who applaud him in the Park of Culture and 
Recreation, but also from those who are horrified by the 
possibility of his return to the political arena. After all, 
Meciar recently declared that his first step will be to remove 
President Michal Kovac from office. He moderated his tone, he 
controls himself well, and he shows much more willingness to 
meet others halfway, but obviously he will not forgive his 
political opponents anything. It was clear mainly from what he 
said about the election law that is being drafted: 
  "Moravcik's present party, which sits in the parliament 
without the benefit of elections, is not legitimately in the 
parliament and should collect 10,000 signatures. They are now 
thinking about how to repeal this part of the election law, so 
that they would not have to meet this obligation. But that would 
create a situation where every family could establish its own 
party and run in the elections." 
  We can accept this statement, to be sure, only with a big 
dose of benevolence, as a kind of poetic license, because, to 
establish a political party, you also need 10,000 signatures. 
More fundamental will be whether Vladimir Meciar will succeed in 
acquiring a new image of a more tolerant politician, one who 
respects the rules of democratic politics and who will not 
ruthlessly pursue his vision of political power. If he also 
wants to convince the voters from other political parties of 
this, he must first distance himself from the militant groups of 
his followers, as he did in this interview, when he reacted to 
the statement of one participant in the meeting: Better a civil 
war than Michal Kovac as president. 
  "There can be an agent provocateur in every crowd," said 
Meciar, "but that does not mean that this agent provocateur is 
my follower. My followers were, and are, civil people." If 
Vladimir Meciar succeeds in convincing our entire nation of 
this, it will be his greatest victory.

transportation. This transpires from Slovak Statistical Office 
data that were made available to CTK yesterday. 
  Compared with April 1993, retail sales increased 0.3 percent 
in current prices, but the physical volume of sales decreased 
12.3 percent. 
  Production in the month of April, compared with March, 
decreased 12 percent in industry but increased 1 percent in 
construction. The volume of goods in freight transportation 
decreased 4.1 percent. Retail sales were 8 percent lower than in 
March, while the physical volume of sales decreased 8.4 percent. 
  The number of employees in industry declined 0.8 percent in 
April, compared with March. In private companies, including 
cooperatives, it increased 35.6 percent. 
  The average nominal monthly wages in industry amounted to 
6,063 Slovak korunas [Sk] and were Sk228 lower than in March. 
In construction, they amounted to Sk5,824 (- Sk95) and in 
retailing to Sk4,731 (+ Sk17). 
  The final consumption of households in current prices 
reached 
Sk54.7 billion in the first quarter, and the monthly wages 
averaged Sk5,581. 
  Investments in the Slovak economy reached Sk16.4 billion in 
1993 prices, which is only 40.1 percent of their level in the 
preceding quarter. 
  [Prague HOSPODARSKE NOVINY in Czech on 21 June on page 4,

<F P=106> [Article by Miroslav Prchal: "Signs of Slight Improvement </F>
Have Become Visible in the Slovak Republic's Economy"] 
  [Text] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has told 
HOSPODARSKE NOVINY that signs of slight improvement in the 
economy have appeared in Slovakia in the past few months, 
particularly in the chemical and rubber industries. 
  When asked what merit his government, which assumed office 
about three months ago, deserves for this, the prime minister 
said that he would not quantify it. "For us, it is important to 
strengthen even more the positive elements that are beginning to 
appear in the economy, and thus to improve the stability of our 
economic development as rapidly as possible. We have the 
prerequisites for this. We have made a firm decision to keep 
the state budget deficit and inflation at a certain acceptable 
level and to deal with unemployment with our development 
programs, particularly in those regions where unemployment is 
highest," he said. 
  Asked in which areas his government wants to support the 
positive elements of economic development, the prime minister 
said that it would release additional funds from extra budgetary 
sources, particularly from the proceeds of privatization, to 
support, above all, construction activity, the completion of the 
comprehensive housing construction work, and small and 
medium-size enterprises, which are to become the engine of the 
Slovak economy, and also the construction of roads and other 
communication links and certain railroads. 
  He said that the goal this year is to bring to a complete 
halt the decline in gross domestic product, cut inflation to 13 
percent (from 23.1 percent last year), and to keep the budget 
deficit at 14 billion Slovak korunas. "We intend to continue 
our tight fiscal policy," he stressed. 
  "Apart from some positive statistical data, we have the 
slightly negative signal that the volume of investment in the 
Slovak Republic has declined," he added and drew attention to 
the fact that Slovakia provides a number of comparative 
advantages for foreign investors--for instance, comparable 
qualified labor is 40 percent cheaper than in Poland, 25 percent 
cheaper than in Hungary, and 10 percent cheaper than in the 
Czech Republic. 
  As regards the volume of investment in Slovakia, the Czech 
Republic is third, with its volume of 13 percent after Austria 
(23 percent) and Germany (21 percent). Jozef Moravcik 
commented: "I believe that this could be better, but this is a 
matter, above all, for Czech investors to consider." 
  Regarding the report that the IMF is to provide a 
stabilization loan in July and to the question of whether this 
decision will also have political significance for his 
government in the preelection period, Moravcik said: "Above 
all, I attach economic importance to this credit. Its 
importance lies in the fact that Slovakia has been positively 
evaluated by this renowned financial institution and thereby has 
acquired better and more advantageous conditions in dealing with 
other financial institutions."

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Wagrowska: "Jerzy Milewski, under </F>
secretary of state at the Ministry of National Defense: 
Poland-NATO Agreement Will Be Signed Soon; What Shape of the 
Partnership?"] 
  [Text] RZECZPOSPOLITA is the first paper that has been able 
to take a look at the document entitled "Individual Program of 
Partnership between the Polish Republic and NATO" (IPP)--that 
is, the agreement on mutual military and political cooperation 
resulting from the Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. 
  The document, which may be published only simultaneously in 
Poland and the West, consists of 32 typewritten pages. It 
includes a one-page political declaration; the following pages 
contain details of various undertakings. The first part of the 
IPP document recalls the declaration made at the NATO summit on 
10 January of this year and the offer of the Partnership for 
Peace, then the fact that Poland signed the so-called framework 
document of the PFP on 2 February (general rules of 
participation in the program). It is also recalled that our goal 
is participation in the organization and the incorporation of 
operational forces into the integrated military structure of 
NATO. Therefore, we are ready to attain the capability for 
joint operations and to adjust to the requirements of the 
Western Armed Forces. In the second part of the document, all 
intentions are marked with the symbols P1, P2, and P3. These 
symbols denote the sequence of the implementation of the various 
intentions. Each page is divided into six vertical columns: 
Code, Areas of Cooperation (Goals of the Partner), General 
Activities of the PFP, Type, Executive Instance, Remarks. 
  NATO has recognized the fact that the main Polish priority 
in 
cooperation with this organization is to ensure our country's 
effective air defense, which is possible exclusively in a system 
integrated with NATO. NATO has generally agreed that the issues 
of the so-called three "C's" (communication, command, control 
[preceding three words in English]--that is, the systems of 
communication, command, and control) are the most important to 
us, and it also wants to include them in the area of cooperation 
with Poland. 
  According to Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in the 
Ministry of National Defense [MON], who has all along been 
responsible for the shape of the agreement with NATO, an 
agreement that was proposed by NATO at the January summit 
meeting and that is now at the final stage of negotiation, the 
final agreement will not differ, at least basically, from the 
joint decisions that have already been made. 
  The IPP will be accepted any day now, certainly before the 
visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton to Poland (6 and 7 July). 
Poland was the first country to present NATO with the so-called 
presentation document (25 April), in which it specified its 
priorities for cooperation (after the so-called framework 
agreement, containing general rules and plans, was signed on 2 
February). Now it will be the first country to sign the IPP 
with NATO. It will be of symbolic significance to both us and 
the "16." To us, because we stated already a long time ago that 
our strategic goal is to join the Euro-Atlantic security 
structures, and to them because they perceive Poland as a 
country that is determined to join NATO. 
<H5>  We Are Setting Off Without an Umbrella </H5>
  When they started negotiating IPP, Poland and NATO had 
relatively little cooperation experience; however, there were no 
serious problems in the friendly atmosphere in which the talks 
were held, stressed Jerzy Milewski, under secretary of state in 
MON, in an interview for RZECZPOSPOLITA. We were able to draw 
on bilateral agreements--that is, on undertakings that were 
planned earlier by Poland and the individual NATO member states, 
such as the joint exercises with the Dutch, the British, and the 
French. Also, we could take advantage of the contacts within the 
framework of the North-Atlantic Council, which existed until the 
end of 1991. 
  In its presentation document, Poland listed its wishes and 
proposals in 40 points. NATO experts codified them in a method 
practiced in contacts among the member states of the "16." They 
marked them with appropriate symbols, letters, and numbers. As a 
result, the entire IPP document, except for the one-page 
preamble, consists of tables. 
<H5>  There Were No New Ideas </H5>
  Then negotiations started (on the level of officers of both 
sides), the goal of which was to explain the various points. 
"During these talks," Milewski emphasizes, "NATO did not have 
any new concrete ideas; however, the organization's intentions 
for cooperation with us became increasingly clear." 
  NATO's negotiators wanted Poland to do the following: 

  -  Agree to use the principle of clarity in the activity of 
the Armed Forces--that is, agree to introduce the fundamental 
standards that would make the planned activity predictable for 
all partners. 
  -  Agree to democratic control over the Army 
(exercised by elected civilian authorities). 
  -  Be able and ready 
to take part in UN peacekeeping forces because peacekeeping 
missions are currently becoming the basic type of military 
activities and of preventing destabilization in the world. 
  -  Be 
able to take on peacekeeping, rescue, and other types of 
operations thanks to joint defense planning and exercises. 
  -  Make 
clear its intentions concerning its future cooperation with the 
organization. 

  Poland accepts all these conditions. 
  Jerzy Milewski underscores that Poland's participation in 
the PFP is subordinated to our strategic goal, formulated two 
and a half years ago: full membership of Poland in NATO. This 
is why Poland declared in the IPP that it will incorporate all 
of its operational forces into the military structures of NATO, 
even though we were only expected to double our participation in 
peacekeeping missions. Poland will take measures that may help 
us incorporate our own Army in the NATO structure: The 
commanding staff of our Army will cooperate with the 
various--land, air, naval--commanding staffs of the joint NATO 
forces in Europe and with the combined task forces [preceding 
three words in English], which are being established by NATO 
right now. 
  Cooperation with NATO would consist of the following: 

  -  The beginning of permanent consultations concerning the 
defense policy. 
  -  Communication between our General Staff and 
SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe) and AFCENT 
(Allied Forces Central Europe). 
  -  Installation of technical means 
of communication (mainly digital communication, coding 
methods). 
  -  A striving to adjust the Polish Air Defense and 
incorporate it in the integrated NATO system (which in the West 
is at least 50-percent automated). Poland mainly wants to get 
access to the air reconnaissance system. 
  -  Adaptation of the 
command procedures and all other procedures, such as signs on 
maps and methods of commanding (in NATO, there are approximately 
2,000 signs that codify their procedures). 

  The IPP envisions various individual undertakings that are 
supposed to help achieve these goals. 
<H5>  In Entirety or in Part </H5>
  According to Milewski, we must strive for a situation in 
which both all our Armed Forces and smaller formations (such as 
one corps, three divisions, two battalions) can be used--in 
cooperation with NATO. Contrary to what it seems to be, the 
second possibility may be more difficult to implement because 
the isolated units must be able to operate on their own, must be 
well equipped and mobile. Later at least some Polish airfields 
and martial ports should be adjusted to Western standards; in 
addition, appropriate supply needs should be satisfied--for 
example, fuel characterized by appropriate parameters. 
  Minister Milewski believes that cooperation with NATO should 
develop "step by step." As a result of concrete minor 
organizational and technical measures, as well as greater 
undertakings, the Polish Armed Forces should be considered to be 
adjusted to NATO requirements, adjusted to cooperation so that 
all or part of those forces could be commanded by international 
commanders, should a NATO summit decide to launch a military 
operation. 
<H5>  Under the Name PFP </H5>
  Cooperation within the framework of the PFP is practically 
under way. Before that, even before an agreement is reached, the 
planned undertakings have already begun--under the name PFP. 
From the formal point of view, the first joint undertaking will 
be international exercises of the peacekeeping forces, which 
will be conducted on the firing ground near Zagan in September. 
Participating in it will be 400-500 U.S. Army soldiers, soldiers 
from other Western countries and from Poland and some 
Central-East European states. Because NATO is the one that 
issues an invitation, the possibility cannot be ruled out that 
the Russians will also come to Zagan. Soldiers will use only 
light personal arms. 
  Central-East European states unofficially inform each other 
about their negotiations with NATO. Individual programs of 
partnership will not be secret. It will be possible to review 
these documents every year. 
<H5>  Without Political Protection </H5>
  The question whether the IPP is satisfactory to Poland 
evoked 
many words that were critical of the entire PFP; Jerzy Milewski 
told us that two aspects should be distinguished in this 
program. The first concerns so-called temporary guarantees; the 
other pertains to a long-term program of full integration with 
Western structures. The PFP was rightly criticized as a program 
that would not give us any political protection from pressure on 
the part of the Russian Federation, the goal of which is to 
leave Poland and other Central European states in the gray zone. 
This pressure caused anxiety among the people. Because the 
pressure did not encounter a counterreaction from the Western 
states, the entire situation began to be increasingly similar to 
Yalta. If we were offered membership in NATO or at least some 
form of association with the organization, political protection 
would be expected. Full integration into NATO is not possible 
right now. It calls for an adaptation process, as a result of 
which our defense structure would be adjusted to the NATO 
structure. This should make our future membership real, not 
only formal. We look upon the PFP as a mechanism to help 
integration into NATO, and, from this standpoint, it can be 
considered sufficient. 
  Jerzy Milewski stresses that Poland should make efforts to 
be 
admitted to the NATO structures gradually. The political 
integration might be made right now; military integration, 
because of the necessity of defense planning and adapting the 
Army, would take some time. The example of Spain, which signed 
six agreements on gradual integration before it was actually 
admitted to NATO, shows that gradual integration is possible.

<F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Romaszewski, chairman of the </F>
Solidarity parliamentary caucus, by correspondent Barbara 
Madajczyk-Krasowska; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What type of political 
system is proposed in the "social" draft constitution? 
  [Romaszewski] A cabinet-cum-parliament system, with the 
president discharging a control function and elected by general 
vote. The president will have supervision over all control and 
monitoring institutions--for example, the Supreme Chamber of 
Control and the National Labor Inspectorate. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will the president's range of 
competence will be narrower than in the Small Constitution? 
  [Romaszewski] The current division of the executive power 
generates conflict between the president and the government. In 
our view, we cannot have a situation where the three most 
important government departments are outside parliamentary 
control. Moreover, this division also causes tensions within the 
government and results in a decisions blockade. 
  We have a choice between two political systems. In the 
first, which is in practice in the United States, the president 
is responsible for the entire executive administration, but even 
there parliament has a very wide range of powers relative to 
control of the executive administration, including the power to 
recall the president. In the second system, the prime minister 
is responsible for the whole executive sector. It is very 
difficult to achieve a cross between these two systems, so we 
decided to entrust the executive powers to the prime minister, 
who answers to parliament. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In this situation, is there any point 
in electing the president in a general ballot? 
  [Romaszewski] That has, in its way, become a tradition now. 
Moreover, it is important that the president's authority is 
reinforced by the system whereby he is elected in a general 
ballot. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will it be a constitution according to 
the model put forward by the Solidarity trade union? 
  [Romaszewski] No. It will be a constitution focused broadly 
on the questions of human rights, civil rights, and civil 
freedoms, in which emphasis will be placed on employees' rights. 
It will contain a provision introducing a novel 
institution--that is, a Tripartite Commission--which will 
include representatives of employers, employees, and the 
government. The commission will be responsible for such matters 
as, for example, the setting of the minimum wage. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] The project accords an important 
position to the Senate, does it not? 
  [Romaszewski] There are only two options here: Either the 
Senate goes or it stays. In its present shape, the Senate is 
superfluous because all it does is repeat the Sejm's work. 
Because we decided to retain the institution of the Senate, we 
recommend that an unambiguous formula be found for its function. 
The Senate should provide a representation for local 
administration. Its members should be elected according to the 
electoral law currently in force, which gives equal rights to 
such voivodships as Suwalki, Slupsk, and Chelm, each of which 
elects two senators. This is most important because this gives 
the so-called Poland-B [undeveloped, rural, poorer regions] an 
equal chance to be represented. The Sejm, which is elected 
according to the proportional representation principle, is 
dominated by the large urban centers. 
  We believe that Polish parliamentary life suffers from the 
disease of politicizing and partisanship. Accordingly, we 
suggest that the Senate be placed outside political games and 
strategies. That is why we want to make senators' seats 
independent of their party allegiance. It will mean that all 
senatorial candidates belonging to a particular party should, 
once elected, suspend their party allegiance. Thus, political 
party caucuses should cease to operate within the Senate. There 
would be no direct equivalent in the Senate of the parliamentary 
party clubs that operate in the Sejm. The Senate as a 
parliamentary chamber would gather together genuine political 
authorities rather than representatives of political parties. 
The legislative initiative would rest with individual senators 
rather than with the Senate as a whole. At the moment, the 
Senate's legislative initiative is practically nonoperative. 
  The Senate would also appoint special commissions to 
investigate individual cases. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Are you thinking here of special 
investigative commissions appointed to examine malpractice 
allegations against the government? 
  [Romaszewski] Yes. If such a commission is set up within 
the Sejm, in which the government has the majority of votes, its 
work will always be illusory. If we place such structures 
within the Senate, we stand a better chance of obtaining 
positive results. We are very much interested in separating the 
Senate from the executive apparatus and from personal 
competition over ministerial posts. The Senate should occupy 
itself mainly with legislative work and with discharging a 
special kind of control function. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You want to write a range of citizens' 
social welfare entitlements into the future constitution, but we 
know that, for example, the right to free medical treatment is 
in practice largely fictitious. 
  [Romaszewski] We have been very careful in this respect and 
tried to formulate these provisions so that they would not lend 
themselves to becoming empty phrases, to ensure that the 
constitution is indeed the fundamental legal act. We have 
included no unrealistic provisions with which people would be at 
a loss as to how to apply them. We tried to follow the line of 
making certain regulations more precise--especially those 
concerning health and family protection laws. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Certain critics of your model of the 
constitution accuse it of excessive right-wing orientation. 
  [Romaszewski] This does not mean a thing. After all, it 
would be hard to find right-wing leanings in a document that 
provides so extensively for union rights. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But the preamble is formulated in a 
most grandiloquent style. 
  [Romaszewski] It is modeled on the preamble to the 3 May 
[1791] Constitution. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] And it does mention Christian values. 
  [Romaszewski] I believe that our proposed solutions in the 
sphere of state-church relations are not controversial. We 
assume autonomy for all religious denominations. Moreover, 
relations between the state and the Catholic Church are 
regulated by the Concordat. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why do you insist on suggesting in the 
constitution that two-thirds of the parliament's composition be 
elected by a majority vote? Do you want to get rid of 
parliamentary party caucuses? 
  [Romaszewski] It is most important to include the 
declaration on electoral law in the constitution because 
parliament will never do that itself. Our political parties are 
rather small, and their members move in their exclusive circles. 
Unless we introduce the majority-rule electoral law, they will 
never gain strength and will not broaden their membership to 
include wide reaches of people not immediately interested in 
gaining positions in the power apparatus. The leaders will 
always formulate the type of electoral law that will seem to 
bring the most advantages to the parties themselves and to no 
one else. 
  We are in favor of keeping political parties going, but we 
also suggest that deputies be selected according to a mixed-type 
electoral law, weighted in favor of offering a larger proportion 
to the majority vote. Sejm deputies and senators would then be 
elected in their wards according to the majority-vote electoral 
law. In other words, those who gain the largest number of votes 
will win the seat. There would also be an additional, national 
candidates' list. Seats won on that list would be shared 
proportionately by the political parties, depending on the 
number of seats won in individual election wards. In this way, 
the political parties would be forced to put up their best 
candidates in their wards, even if the candidates themselves 
came from outside the wards, because the number of seats to be 
won by them from the national list would depend on the number of 
votes obtained by these candidates. This type of electoral law 
would create a genuine social representation in parliament 
instead of bringing into parliament people interested only in 
acquiring and wielding power. The current proportional electoral 
Sejm law in force, which gives priority to political parties, 
only discourages people from taking part in parliamentary 
elections. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why is it to our advantage to 
endorse and support the draft constitution proposed by 
Solidarity? 
  [Romaszewski] Because it offers a comprehensive project of 
the fundamental law, reinforces unequivocally democratic values, 
and arises from Solidarity and post-Solidarity circles. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Let us assume that some 500,000 people 
sign a petition in favor of the proposed draft constitution. 
Will the present parliament consider it then? 
  [Romaszewski] If the parliamentary commission fails to 
consider a draft proposal that has obtained 500,000 or more 
signatures, it should consider the possibility that any serious 
departures from the version proposed in that draft may cause a 
rejection of its own draft constitution in a national 
referendum. On the other hand, if it chooses to be directed by 
political realism, it will accept our proposal as the basic 
material for the formulation of the constitution. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] So your proposal of your alternative 
draft constitution is not a kind of "art for art's sake" move? 
  [Romaszewski] No, it is not. The draft constitution 
proposed by post-Solidarity circles is most important for the 
country in a situation where parliament is dominated by 
postcommunist forces. 
  [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Thank you for talking with us.

<F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski and Jerzy Pilczynski: "For </F>
the Leftist Character--That Is, for Votes"] 
  [Excerpts] On 26 June the Union of Labor [UP] officially 
joined the opposition. It decided that the Democratic Left 
Alliance [SLD] moved to the center of the political scene, that 
it is not implementing its election promises, and that it is no 
longer the left wing. Thus, on our political scene, there arose 
a dispute that has already often appeared in the history of the 
left wing: What is the "proper" left wing, and what is only 
pretending to be the left wing? 
<H5>  A Favorable "No" </H5>
  UP took part in lengthy negotiations with the Polish Peasant 
Party [PSL] and the SLD regarding the formation of the 
government; however, it finally said "no." [passage omitted] 
<H5>  The Opposition </H5>
  At the Sunday session of the National Council, 38 persons 
voted in favor of UP's passing to the official opposition, eight 
were against, and one abstained. The decision is of some 
significance chiefly in terms of propaganda. UP never was a 
member of the governing coalition; in voting, it has acted for a 
few months now rather like an opposition party. Thus, nothing 
will change in the Sejm. 
  The coalition maintains its advantage. UP will not 
necessarily increase the strength of the parliamentary 
opposition. It criticizes the opposition from the position of a 
leftist party--that is, from a position entirely different from 
the positions of the Confederation for an Independent Poland, 
the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, or the majority of the 
Union of Freedom. It is worth recalling that UP abstained from 
voting on the report on the implementation of the budget by the 
Suchocka government. 
<H5>  There Is Something Else Behind It </H5>
  UP's decision to officially join the opposition is not 
addressed to political groupings. Its addressees are supposed 
to be voters--voters of UP, as well as voters of the SLD. The 
UP Council argues that the SLD has moved toward the center of 
the political scene, that it has ceased to be part of the left 
wing, and that right now UP is turning out to be the sole 
defender of leftist values. UP will be the leftist opposition 
to the government, which, according to it, is centrist. At a 27 
June press conference, Ryszard Bugaj said that the party's 
decision to join the opposition will not cause any serious 
political consequences in this parliament. 
  The argumentation is quite risky. No matter how far to the 
right the SLD has moved--if it has moved in that direction at 
all--it seems that an attempt to persuade voters that the SLD is 
no longer part of the left wing cannot be successful. 
  However, UP is in a comfortable situation right now as the 
last defender of the left. It will certainly act on behalf of 
the people, to whom the SLD promised social values in the 
election campaign, and the promises have not been kept. Thus, 
UP will speak on behalf of not only those who voted for it but 
also those who elected the SLD. It will hope that, among SLD 
voters, there are people who are really disappointed with the 
current policy of their party and will begin supporting UP 
instead. 
  UP was established as the postsolidarity left wing. As such, 
it enjoyed the sympathy of centrist and rightist postsolidarity 
politicians as well. They hoped that its establishment would 
break apart the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, attract 
some of the more valuable groups from this party, and, as a 
result, parties of the Polish People's Republic's origin would 
be relegated to the margin. The last elections must have put an 
end to these hopes: It became clear that SLD exists and will 
continue to exist. When the PSL and the SLD formed the 
government, it also became clear that sooner or later UP would 
try to find a place for itself on the right side of the 
political scene. The only thing that had to be done was to 
choose the right moment. 
  From the UP point of view, it seems that it was high time. 
The party has been going through some problems lately. It has 
come to light that one of its politicians, Janusz Szymanski, is 
a member of the Supervisory Board of the Posnania Bank, a bank 
linked to the Elektromis company. Another UP leader, Wojciech 
Lamentowicz, was among those who signed a report on the 
condition of the cadres in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
which caused such a great commotion. In addition, UP's 
influence within "Solidarity" has decreased quite dramatically. 
Finally, in the last self-government elections, the party 
obtained poorer results than had been expected. 
  On 26 June, Bugaj's party started its long campaign to win 
over SLD voters. It is not at all certain what results this 
will yield.

  [Text] Parishes will be paid from the State Atomic Agency 
[PAA] budget for storing nuclear waste in accordance with the 
new version of the atomic law, which was unanimously adopted by 
the Sejm. 
  [Correspondent Malgorzata Wisniewska] Radioactive waste not 
only is produced by nuclear power stations and research 
reactors, but is also a by-product of radiology and the 
production of certain medicines. According to the PAA, nuclear 
waste dumps do not constitute a hazard to the environment. 
  [Begin recording] [Professor Jerzy Niewodniczanski, PAA 
chairman] This is the first condition. All waste and, above 
all, nuclear waste, must be stored in such a way that it cannot 
have any harmful effect on the environment. [end recording] 
  [Wisniewska] The largest dump is in Rozan. For three months 
now, the authorities of this typical holiday village have been 
protesting against the storage of waste in their parish. In 
accordance with the new law, the money for making a dumping site 
available by the parish will be provided in compensation for the 
loss of its good name [sentence as heard]. [video shows: 
industrial site surrounded by wall, guarded by uniformed men] 
  [Begin Niewodniczanski recording] The issue is not in buying 
health for money, not any Judas's silver, but payment for the 
fact that losses have been incurred, for the psychological 
aspects of the problem. [end recording] 
  [Wisniewska] From now on, parishes will find it worthwhile 
to 
store waste. But the inhabitants of Rozan are of a different 
opinion.

  [Text] There has been a further decline in the share of 
exports in the national income. According to the National 
Polish Bank, at the end of last year the foreign trade deficit 
reached over 2 billion zlotys. Maciej Lesny, under secretary of 
state in the Ministry for Foreign Economic Cooperation, has told 
journalists that this trend is against the government's 
intention. Proexport state policy guidelines, which were 
prepared recently, attach much importance to economic contacts 
with Russia, the opening of the European Union markets, and the 
elimination of protectionist measures. 
  [Begin Lesny recording] First, we will be able to give 
export 
incentives to large exporters. Second, we will be able to 
insure them to cover not only commercial risks but also 
political risks, which is extremely important. Third, reputable 
exporters or importers will be able to receive refunds of 
customs duties and taxes very quickly, if they have to use 
imported components for the manufacturing of goods earmarked for 
exports. Home producers will be able to receive VAT 
[value-added tax] refunds on goods to be exported. 
  In the near future, we hope to work out solutions that will 
enable those who have to import materials in order to export 
their products later to avoid paying any charges as a result.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Moslem-Croat forces in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are seriously violating the June 10 
ceasefire, the Yugoslav Government said in a statement on Monday. 
  The government invited the U.N. Security Council to take 
urgent measures to avert consequences which the continued 
negative development might have for the peace process. Quoting 
instances of ceasefire violation, the Government of Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) said in an annexe to its statement that 
Moslem forces were constantly provoking incidents by opening 
artillery fire on positions of the Bosnian Serb Army and 
civilian targets. 
  A number of civilian facilities have been destroyed and 
there 
have been casualties among the civilians, which have been 
particularly heavy in the area in Brcko, East and West of 
Vozuca, the suburbs of Teslic and in Doboj (all in the north) 
and in Srbobran and the adjacent territories (in central 
Bosnia). Moslem forces have occupied a number of Serb villages, 
the government said in the annexe. 
  Bosnian Croat and Moslem forces are relocating substantial 
formations north and south of the Posavina corridor in the Sava 
River valley in the north, which links the east and west of the 
Bosnian Serb republic. Neighbouring Croatia is concentrating 
troops in the area of Zupanja and Slavonski Brod on the border 
with Bosnia, the annexe said. 
  South of the corridor, in the direction of Brcko, the 
Moslems 
have concentrated five brigades and six battalions brought in 
from the U.N.-designated 'save haven' of Tuzla in the northeast, 
totalling 18,000 troops, 25 tanks and between 50 and 60 
artillery weapons of calibres larger than 100 mm, the annexe 
said. 
  Against Doboj and Modrica, the Moslems have lined up five 
brigades and two battalions, totalling 11,000 troops, 20 tanks 
and between 30 and 40 big-bore artillery weapons, while strong 
Moslem forces are concentrated against Teslic in the north. 
  Furthermore, the Moslems are unlawfully using markings of 
the 
U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), the Yugoslav Government said, 
specifying that the Moslems have painted white two helicopters 
in Sarajevo and three in Zenica in central Bosnia, and have used 
them to ferry arms and military equipment as well as troops to 
their forces confronting Bosnian Serb positions. 
  Bosnian Croats, too, have relocated troops from the south to 
Kupres and Zepce in central Bosnia, and have concentrated 10,000 
troops, reinforced with several battalions of new recruits from 
neighbouring Croatia, on the bridgehead at Orasje, north of the 
Posavina corridor, the statement said. 
  UNPROFOR has been officially informed about the incidents, 
and could witness on the ground the unjustifiable behaviour of 
the Moslem forces, which runs contrary to the ceasefire 
agreement. UNPROFOR officials have assured Bosnian Serb Army 
representatives that they would inform their commands about the 
matter, the Yugoslav Government said in the annexe to its 
statement.

<F P=106> [Report by Mirjana Protic] </F>
  [Text] Speaking at a news conference today, Federal Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic conveyed to the journalists the 
government's view that the economic policy and the economic 
recovery program for this year are being successfully 
implemented. Foreign currency reserves have been increased, the 
gold reserves are not being used. The Federal Government has 
adopted a decision to mint a gold coin. It has also issued a 
statement regarding the latest events in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which warns, among other things, the United 
Nations and the Security Council that the Muslim-Croatian forces 
are stepping up their attacks. Mirjana Protic reports: 
  [Protic] Immediately after the session of the Federal 
Government, Prime Minister Radivoje Kontic held a news 
conference in the Palace of the Federation at which he expressed 
the most important details regarding the work of the government 
in the past week. At a joint session of the Federal Government, 
the heads of the republican governments, and the governor of the 
National Bank of Yugoslavia [Dragoslav Avramovic], the 
participants discussed the realization of the program of 
economic and monetary stabilization and the economic recovery of 
the country. 
  Within its constitutional powers, the Federal Government 
also 
discussed the realization of the economic policy for this year. 
Prime Minister Kontic conveyed the Federal Government's 
assessment of how the program is being realized. 
  [Begin Kontic recording] In the realization of the economic 
policy this year, positive trends have been noted in all 
sectors, in almost all sectors of production. In brief, what is 
this reflected in? First of all the stability the dinar has 
been preserved. This is best reflected through the retained 
parity of one to one [not further specified], even though we had 
in the meantime several attacks, several attempts to destabilize 
the dinar. However, we responded successfully to all these 
attacks. 
  I would say that the stability of prices has been 
maintained, 
with some occasional fluctuations. So, for instance, when I was 
here last time, I think I expressed dissatisfaction with the way 
prices were increasing in the agricultural sectors. In the 
third week of June, prices went up by as much as 2 percent. 
Explaining this increase, I said at the same time that next 
week, considering the causes of the price increase, prices of 
agricultural products would fall. I can say with great pleasure 
that last week, in comparison with the previous week, there was 
a general fall in prices amounting to 1.9 percent. [end 
recording] 
  [Protic] Prime Minister Kontic then stressed that the 
foreign reserves of the National Bank of Yugoslavia have been 
increased, and that gold reserves are intact. Positive trends 
have been recorded in the rate of increase of production. 
  Prime Minister Kontic also spoke to the journalists about 
the 
situation in the Nonaligned Movement. The direct motive for 
that was the behavior by certain countries and the failure to 
invite the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to take part in the 
recent conference in Cairo. The Federal Government has 
concluded that the Non-Aligned Movement has not managed to adapt 
itself to the new conditions in the world. Room has been left 
for some Islamic countries to exert their influence. Prime 
Minister Kontic said that there are some exceptions. However, 
the status of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as an equal 
members has been denied. The official document on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina reflects the aggressive policy of the Muslim 
countries, as well as (?incorrect) picture of the events in this 
region. 
  The Federal Government has concluded that Yugoslavia should 
retain its membership in the movement as the withdrawal from the 
Nonaligned Movement would be a concession to some Islamic 
countries that are demanding it. 
  The Federal Government has also adopted a special statement 
on the latest events in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The international 
community, the United Nations, and the European Union have been 
warned about the general deterioration of the situation, 
primarily because of the attacks by the Muslim forces. The FRY 
[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Government expects the Security 
Council to take all the necessary measures so that the peace 
chance is not missed. Otherwise, there could be unforeseeable 
consequences and the war could escalate. 
  Journalists were informed that the Federal Government has 
adopted a decision on minting a gold coin to mark the 110th 
anniversary of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. These gold 
coins will be used to purchase agricultural products, above all, 
wheat. The National Bank of Yugoslavia will set the price of 
the gold coins. On one side, the coin portrays a dove of peace 
and an olive branch, while the other has the coat of arms of the 
FRY and the old building of the National Bank of Yugoslavia. 
  Replying to journalists' questions, Prime Minister Kontic 
said that a sufficient amount of money would be secured to 
purchase wheat. The Federal Government also adopted a decision 
to adjust the salaries in state organs, the public sector, and 
all noneconomic activities to the salaries in the industry that 
are linked to the rise in production.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav 
Government takes the position that Yugoslavia's exclusion from 
the Cairo nonaligned ministerial conference earlier this month 
was unprecedented in the history of the movement and cast a 
shadow on its democratic character, the Yugoslav premier said on 
Monday. 
  "We have requested that the Cairo document include our 
reservations in the section dealing with the former Yugoslav 
republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which we shall distribute via 
the Yugoslav mission in New York to the movement member-states 
and demand that it have the force of a U.N. document," Prime 
Minister Radoje Kontic told a press conference. 
  Egypt, which hosted the June conference, barred Yugoslavia 
(Serbia/Montenegro) from participation, in a decision 
unprecedented in the movement's annals. 
  The Yugoslav diplomacy saw this as a manipulation of the 
rules of procedure because of a fear that Yugoslavia's presence 
might substantially alter the climate at the conference, 
especially as regards the Bosnian crisis, which would not have 
suited the book of Egypt and many another Islamic state. In 
order to avoid this, they have, regrettably, aligned the 
movement behind one of the Bosnian warring sides, viz. the 
Moslems. 
  The government took the position that Yugoslavia should 
retain its membership in the movement, regardless of its virtual 
suspension as a result of the manipulations and violation of 
rules of procedure which resulted in its not being invited to 
the Cairo conference, said Kontic. 
  Yugoslavia's membership has virtually been suspended not as 
a 
result of a true consensus of opinion among the member-nations 
or of any concrete decision, but as a result of manipulations 
and outside pressure by individual militant Islamic countries, 
he said. 
  The government has instructed the Foreign Ministry to draft 
the country's long-term platform on the movement which would 
serve Yugoslavia's interests, upgrade its international position 
and help lift the sanctions which the international community 
clamped on Yugoslavia in 1992 for its alleged involvement in the 
Bosnian war, and in addition help the movement adjust to the new 
conditions of a non-bloc world.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 27 (TANJUG) -- The Yugoslav 
Government on Monday expressed utmost concern over a dangerous 
deterioration of the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, caused by continued offensive operations 
of Muslim-Croat forces, and it called for an urgent U.N. 
Security Council action. 
  Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic quoted at a news 
conference, held after the federal government session, a 
statement in which the government said it expected of the U.N. 
Security Council immediately to take necessary measures to avoid 
consequences which a further negative development of events 
could have for the peace process. 
  The Yugoslav Government statement said that, at the present 
crucial moment, it was the primary duty and responsibility of 
the Security Council not to permit a real chance for a peaceful 
resolution of the conflict in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina to 
fall through. The statement said that, if use was not made of 
that chance, there would unavoidably follow an escalation of 
conflicts with unforeseeable consequences. 
  Prime Minister Kontic said that the developments since June 
10, when the Geneva ceasefire agreement went into effect, showed 
that not all sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina wanted a peaceful 
solution. 
  The creation of the Muslim-Croat federation in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina has increased the ambitions of the radical 
Muslim leadership to persevere in its choice of a military 
solution, Kontic said. He set out that the Muslim-Croat side 
was using the Geneva ceasefire agreement for open preparations 
for a large-scale military offensive, which he said was 
confirmed in reports of the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). 
  The Yugoslav Government said the UNPROFOR reports showed, 
among other things, that Muslim-Croat forces were supplying 
themselves with large quantities of most modern weapons and were 
not prevented in doing so. 
  The statement said the regrouping of Muslim-Croat forces, 
coupled with a steady escalation of their combat operations, 
aimed at provoking the resumption of the war, were a flagrant 
violation of the ceasefire agreement and could seriously 
undermine all efforts invested so far to achieve peace in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  The Yugoslav Government said that Muslim-Croat forces were 
of 
late launching strong offensive operations against Bosnian Serb 
positions, and also towns, practically on all lines separating 
the two sides, which it said resulted in numerous casualties 
among the civilian population and in material damages. 
  The statement said it was encouraging, nevertheless, that 
the 
Bosnian Serb forces were, for the time being, reacting with 
extreme restraint to the Muslim-Croat offensive operations and 
preventing the military operations from turning into a conflict 
on the largest possible scale. 
  The Yugoslav Government said it viewed as crucial the 
current 
phase of the negotiations, which it said should lead to a 
resolution of the crisis caused by the civil war in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Prime Minister Kontic said it was the Yugoslav Government's 
position that the active participation of international 
factors--the United Nations, the European Union, the United 
States and Russia-- in the quest of a lasting political 
solution, one acceptable to all sides in the Bosnian conflict, 
gave rise to hope that the tragic civil war would soon be 
brought to a halt and conditions would be created also for the 
solution of other major issues on the territory of the former 
Yugoslavia. 
  The Yugoslav Government expects that full use will be made 
of 
the currently favourable elements and it, itself, is trying to 
make a concrete contribution to that end. 
  The government said that Yugoslavia maintained that stable 
peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina was possible only through 
negotiations, and it called on the international community to 
put pressure on those who were violating the signed ceasefire 
agreement and demand that they immediately accept peace as the 
sole option. 
  The Yugoslav Government listed in the annex to the statement 
the ceasefire violations committed by the Muslim side since the 
agreement took effect. 
  The Yugoslav Government set out in the annex that UNPROFOR 
representatives had been informed about all the incidents, and 
that they, themselves, had been able to see in the field that 
Muslim troops were acting contrary to the ceasefire agreement. 
It said UNPROFOR representatives had promised representatives of 
the Bosnian Serb Army that they would inform their respective 
commands about everything.

  [Text] Ivana Anyzova reports on today's talks between Czech 
Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus and Albanian Prime Minister 
Aleksander Meksi. 
  [Anyzova] The two prime ministers signed an agreement on 
trade and technical relations and one on the support and mutual 
protection of investments. They exchanged information about the 
situation in their countries, foreign policy initiatives, and 
bilateral relations. They expressed a wish to develop mutual 
contacts in science, culture, and tourism. They also agreed 
that the Czech side will grant Albania a long-term loan to 
purchase farming and food-processing equipment. 
  Although economic cooperation has receded over recent years, 
our side regards as advantageous the fact that Czech goods have 
been offered to Albanian agriculture and the food-processing 
industry. 
  Vaclav Klaus emphasized that such cooperation is a useful 
form of policy aimed at boosting exports.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Karel Kriz; </F>
place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Kriz] On 22 June, the government rejected [Deputy 
Prime Minister Jan] Kalvoda's draft constitutional law on 
forming 13 regions or lands. The resolution adopted recently by 
the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] Executive Council, which 
envisages that these higher territorial self-administrative 
units will evolve from the current districts, also seems to be 
rather unviable. What next? 
  [Klaus] The government has not rejected the proposal for 13 
higher territorial units. It has had six alternative proposals 
in succession and, in essence, is not ruling out any of them. We 
will discuss this issue again on 29 June as the first point on 
the agenda regardless of what else is on it. This is a 
complicated matter, and it is a great shame that parliament has 
"put a lid on it" from above by setting a deadline [for its 
submission] before the end of June. There is thus a risk that 
we will choose a solution that we will perhaps regret in the 
long run. The basic proposition involves parceling out this 
country, a unitary state, into a certain number of regions. 
This is, in essence, an irreversible intrusion into the state 
body of the Czech Republic. 
  This is such a fundamental change that whoever trivializes 
it 
and accuses the government of hesitancy, whoever accuses this or 
that side of not wanting to resolve the issue, is doing this 
country a disservice. As a responsible person, I have to say 
that there is one fair conclusion: There is no obvious consensus 
in this country on this issue, not only in the government, but 
also throughout society. The issue involves whether, in such a 
situation, it would not be better to postpone the matter until 
this has been settled. It would be the greatest shame if, by 
coincidence, only one reason for creating these regions were to 
transpire among the coalition partners or the other political 
forces in parliament--that it would aggravate the ODS. That 
would be a terribly feeble reason, and, unfortunately, I have 
the feeling that, when all is said and done, this is the 
dominant reason at the moment. The rhetoric of this or that 
politician is different, however. 
  [Kriz] Some politicians are casting doubts on your foreign 
policy orientation toward the West... 
  [Klaus] This seems really extraordinarily amusing to me. 
These opinions are being expressed by some Civic Democratic 
Alliance [ODA] representatives who seek out every preposterous 
pretext so they can attack the ODS and me. The West has a 
completely different impression of our stances than the ODA 
Central Office. 
  [Kriz] You have described the 3.5-percent rise in the gross 
domestic product in the first quarter of this year as a 
"breakthrough." There have been a total of 13 quarters since 
the beginning of transformation, however. Of these together, 
growth was achieved in five of them, compared with the same 
quarter of the previous year. Growth of 3.8 percent was even 
achieved in the second quarter of last year. Growth was 
recorded in two successive quarters in the second half of 1992. 
So, this is nothing new. Therefore, did you use too strong an 
expression this time? 
  [Klaus] We envisaged then that the development in the second 
half of 1992 was the start of the growth tendencies. These were 
interrupted by the breakup of Czechoslovakia. This prevented 
1993 from becoming the first year with plus signs. I think that 
the first quarter of 1994 is the beginning, a year later, of 
what was indicated in the second half of 1992. I admit that 
this trend need not be confirmed in the second quarter of this 
year, but there is undoubtedly a general growth tendency here.

  [Text] Prague--Support for authoritarian methods of 
government in the Czech Republic has declined slightly. This is 
apparent from an opinion poll conducted by STEM [Center for 
Empirical Research] in June among 1,506 respondents over age 18. 
  While 61.3 percent of citizens expressed themselves in favor 
of such government in December 1991, this figure has now 
declined to 48.9 percent. Supporters of the firm method are 
found more in the left wing (76 percent of the extreme left 
wing; 60 percent of the left-wing oriented) and the political 
center (51 percent) than in the right wing (42 percent). A firm 
government and a leader who would state clearly what has to be 
done are favored primarily by supporters of the Assembly for the 
Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia [SPR-RSC], followed 
by supporters of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia 
[KSCM], the Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD], and the 
Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party 
[KDU-CSL]. KDU-CSL (61.9 percent), CSSD (61.1 percent), SPR-RSC 
(60.3 percent), and KSCM (52 percent) voters consider extensive 
executive powers for the president to be acceptable. Civic 
Democratic Alliance [ODA] voters are slightly more inclined 
toward a firm government (38.1 percent) and strong leader (36.9 
percent) than Civic Democratic Party [ODS] voters (34.7 and 33.9 
percent). ODA supporters also support a strong president (45.4 
percent) slightly more than ODS supporters (43.3 percent).

<F P=106> [Article by "(joe)": "The Army Is Trying To Manage Itself </F>
Better"] 
  [Text] Prague--The development plan drafted by the Czech 
Republic Army (ACR), which the defense minister will submit to 
the government and parliament for their information, proposes 
that roughly 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product be 
earmarked for the state's defense needs. This statement was 
made at a press briefing held yesterday by Deputy Minister 
Miroslav Kalousek. He described the ACR's drawing on the budget 
this year as equable. The development plan should include 
stipulations concerning the human, material, and financial 
resources for the Army and its programs up to the year 2005 in 
accordance with the priorities of the defense strategy. 
  According to M. Kalousek, the ACR's acquisition plan for its 
modernization should be defined by mid-1995. At the same time, 
the Defense Ministry will give preference to negotiations with 
direct producers, and the final supplier should be a domestic 
company. Public competitions and tenders, with the exception of 
cases where the nature of the order makes this impossible, will 
be implemented as much as possible in making purchases and 
sales. To simplify the contractual relationship, the ministry 
will try--as, for example, it is doing at the moment in 
selecting a food supplier--to find a central guarantor who 
would, among other things, make it possible to resolve the 
problem of different regional prices. In this connection, 
Kalousek referred to the ministry's attempt to create the most 
clear-cut system possible in harmony with legal and ethical 
norms, a system that would eliminate the risk of influence being 
brought to bear on the choice of Army suppliers. 
  The new Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), 
which is operating in parallel with the system utilized to date, 
should make the Army's economic management considerably clearer. 
The ACR will transfer to double-entry bookkeeping in 1995. 
  In assessing the Army's transformation, Kalousek emphasized 
its quite reductive nature. For example, only five of the 
original 12 military airfields should remain in operation. The 
ACR intends to offer to interested parties, within the framework 
of stipulated contractual conditions, those reserve airfields 
whose operation is costly. Projects are now being drawn up for 
the airfields in Bechyne, Zatec, and Hradec Kralove and for 
combined operations in Pardubice. The Army is selling off or 
transferring to other entities its unserviceable facilities and 
hardware. The money saved by reducing the cost of maintaining 
the Army can be used for its modernization, said Kalousek.

  [Text] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman this afternoon 
received Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino, who is paying 
an official visit to the Republic of Croatia at the head of a 
delegation of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the 
president's office said in a statement. 
  The talks focused on numerous issues relating to bilateral 
relations between the two states, particularly to the problem of 
the areas of the Republic of Croatia under Serb occupation and 
the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia--Herzegovina. 
Convergence of views was expressed regarding the resolution of 
some bilateral issues on the basis of friendly relations and 
mutual interests of both countries. Minister Martino's visit 
today provides guarantees for better political and economic 
relations between the two countries to be achieved through the 
spirit of the best possible understanding, the statement says. 
  Attempts should be made to resolve the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a peaceful way. It was stated in this 
context that steps by the so-called contact group countries and 
a meeting of the G-7 and Russia which is to take place in Naples 
at the beginning of next week are hopefully awaited. Hope was 
also expressed that the Serb occupation of areas of the Republic 
of Croatia would be resolved in a peaceful way through the 
reintegration of these areas into the state and legal system of 
the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Italy will try to lend 
all its possible support in this respect by using its influence, 
the statement says in conclusion.

  [Text] Talks between Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs, and Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino ended in Zagreb a short time ago. 
Minister Martino is leading a delegation of his government 
which is paying a visit to the Republic of Croatia. Tihomir 
Vinkovic has a report: 
  [Vinkovic] Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and 
minister of foreign affairs, had talks at the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs in Zagreb this afternoon with Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino. Following the talks Italian Minister 
Martino stated that their talks were cordial and informative and 
added: 
  [Martino, in Italian with superimposed Serbo-Croatian 
translation] "I had an opportunity to hear the Croatian 
Government's opinion on the situation in former Yugoslavia and 
the prospects for peace. This information is valuable to us 
ahead of the forthcoming meeting of the G-7 and Russia in 
Naples. As regards bilateral relations, I am extremely pleased 
with the constructive approach displayed by the Croatian side. 
I also hope that these talks will be put into practice." 
  [Vinkovic] Following the talks Croatian Foreign Minister 
Mate 
Granic stated: 
  [Granic] ``We had a friendly and useful meeting which 
focused 
on the situation in the region, on the situation in the occupied 
areas of the Republic of Croatia and prospects for peaceful 
reintegration, on the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 
prospects for peace there, on forecasts regarding the proposal 
by the contact group, whether it will be accepted or not, and on 
prospects for peace or war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In every case 
Croatia supports the negotiated peaceful option, as this offers 
the chance to restore peace in the entire region. 
  ``We also had talks about bilateral relations, the process 
of 
integration of the Republic of Croatia into Europe. We would 
like to thank Italy for its support to the Republic of Croatia 
in the process of its European integration. This primarily 
refers to an economic agreement with the European Union [EU] and 
its admission to some EU projects, such as PHARE [Aid to Poland 
and Hungary for Economic Reconstruction], the (TEMPUS) program, 
and finally, our goal is associate membership of the EU. 
  "As regards our bilateral relations, i.e. protection of the 
Italian minority, Croatia will observe all their existing rights 
and the best European standards; we are also ready for a 
bilateral agreement with the Republic of Italy." 
  [Vinkovic] The Italian foreign minister will also be 
received 
by Cardinal Kuharic. This evening he will be received by 
Croatian President Dr. Franjo Tudjman.

  [Text] Before his talks with President Tudjman, Antonio 
Martino met his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic and Cardinal 
Franjo Kuharic. He gave a news conference this evening. 
Tihomir Vinkovic reports: 
  [Vinkovic] The Italian foreign minister described his talks 
with President Tudjman and Foreign Minister Granic as cordial 
and useful. 
  [Begin Martino recording, in Italian with superimposed 
Serbo- 
Croartian translation] Both sides confirmed their willingness to 
strengthen the already good relations, and to overcome current 
difficulties. It is necessary to establish a joint commission 
to resolve these issues. 
  Problems of reparations to the Italians who left Croatia 
after World War II as well as the question of the Italian 
minority have to be resolved through talks. Italy will -- by 
resolving the current difficulties and reaching bilateral 
agreements -- help the integration of Croatia and Slovenia into 
the European Union economic system. [end recording] 
  [Vinkovic] He was optimistic regarding the resolution of the 
issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The forthcoming 
meeting in Naples of the G-7 and Russia is important in this 
respect. Antonio Martino described the role of Russia in 
resolving the problems in southeast Europe as constructive.

<F P=106> [Report by Srdjan Radulovic: "Borislav Mikelic Is Preparing </F>
To Travel to Trieste"] 
  [Excerpts] The recent invitation by Gianfranco Fini, 
leader of the Neo-Fascist Union of Italy, to the Krajina prime 
minister, Borislav Mikelic, to meet in Trieste and discuss 
current political issues has caused suspicion in Zagreb and 
attracted the attention of political circles in the West. The 
revival of the Krajina authorities' links with certain Italian 
politicians almost coincides with the assertions that the 
National Union in Berlusconi's coalition "team" is in fact the 
one that is indirectly "promoting" territorial pretensions 
toward Istria, which is directly manifested by demands for the 
revision of the Osimo Agreements. This was why new Italian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Martino said, first in Bonn (!), and 
then in the House of Representatives of the Italian Parliament, 
that "Italy does not have territorial designs on Slovenia and 
Croatia." 
  The Krajina authorities, pressed by accusations that they 
are 
responsible for the failure of the negotiations [with Croatia] 
and by Croatia's threats that it will not extend the mandate to 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] after 30 September, responded 
quickly to Fini's invitation. 
  "Mikelic has accepted the invitation and we will maintain 
contacts with Italy at the levels at which this is possible. In 
any case, we have been pleasantly surprised by the invitation, 
because this is a signal that the RSK [republic of Serbian 
Krajina] has become a subject in international relations, even 
though it has not been recognized." This was stated for BORBA 
by Slobodan Jarcevic, president Martic's adviser for foreign 
affairs and foreign minister in the previous government. 
  The first Krajina-Italian contact at a "higher level" was 
established last September, when socialist Arduino Agnelli 
attended the session of the Krajina assembly, which declared him 
(and his wife) a "honorary citizen of the RSK." [passage omitted] 
  Mr. Agnelli told us that many members of the European 
Parliament held the view that the alteration of borders that was 
allowed in 1991 would not be frozen on the "AVNOJ" [Antifascist 
Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders of the 
former Yugoslav republics. He assured us that Europe realized 
that the ethnic rights of the Serbs are their historical rights, 
and that the right to self-determination is stronger than formal 
communist borders, drawn without taking into consideration any 
historical or ethnic principles. This was the first 
encouragement from the Italian side that the RSK's destiny would 
not be subordinated only to `AVNOJ' borders and the UN Security 
Council's resolutions," Jarcevic said. 
  Apart from Fini's message of support to the Krajina assembly 
at the end of last year, there have been no contacts or exchange 
of messages until the recent one that attracted public's 
attention. Two visits by Slobodan Jarcevic to Italy did not 
receive much publicity. In Italy, he met the representatives of 
the Association of Expelled Italians from Istria and Dalmatia 
and with Italian intellectuals in Milan and Trieste. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>
  [Text] Fikret Abdic, the rebel from the Cazin Krajina, can 
no longer count on any support from Zagreb. He has not had it 
for some time now. We were told this today exclusively for 
Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina by one top-level official in 
the presidential palace in Zagreb, who wished to remain 
anonymous. We can only say that he is a very well-known and 
respected politician in Zagreb, even though he is perhaps not 
the most popular one. 
  Even the Serbs from the so-called Krajina have repudiated 
Abdic, although just a year ago -- when he proclaimed autonomy 
-- they signed an agreement on military aid. However, according 
to the information in Zagreb, now they send him almost no aid, 
or so little that he can do nothing with it against the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, that is, its 5th Corps, our source 
claims. 
  The doors to Zagreb have been closed to Abdic since the 
Washington Agreement. Our source says: The autonomy proclaimed 
in principle in western Bosnia is nearing its end. Abdic danced 
his dance of death around Kladusa and Bihac for only one summer. 
According to the information on the successes of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps, all of western Bosnia will 
soon be under the Sarajevo authority, says our reliable source 
from the presidential palace in Zagreb. If they knew who he 
was, both Fikret Abdic and President Tudjman would probably get 
headaches.

  [Text] As part of the two-day visit to Dubrovnik of the 
diplomatic corps accredited to Albania, talks were held in 
Dubrovnik's Argentina hotel this afternoon between Croatian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader and Albanian Foreign 
Minister Alfred Serreqi. After the talks Ivo Sanader gave the 
following statement: 
  [Begin Sanader recording] It is true, as Albanian Foreign 
Minister Serreqi said, we have met several times before, the 
last time at the Crans Montana forum in Bucharest where we 
exchanged our governments' official stands and viewpoints 
regarding the crisis in the entire territory of southeastern 
Europe. Our talks now were very pleasant and interesting and to 
us also necessary, because we will put forward a request to the 
UN General Assembly--as our public already knows--to include the 
peaceful reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Area] into the 
Republic of Croatia on the agenda of a session scheduled for the 
third week of September. 
  For this item to be included in the agenda we will need help 
from all countries and all our friends. To this aim our 
Minister Granic sent Minister Serreqi a letter of support [as 
heard]. We hope-- and we discussed it today---that Albania will 
support this request by Croatia. I can say that the minister 
promised us something of this kind. 
  This was one issue. Another one concerned bilateral 
relations and the situation in the region, in both Macedonia 
[The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo, 
and especially expectations linked with the plan that the 
Contact Group will present at the beginning of July. I briefed 
the minister on our stand regarding this matter and we agreed on 
the whole about the key issues and ways in which the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina should be resolved. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Zeljko Buksa on speech of Army General Janko </F>
Bobetko in Zagreb on 16 June: "We Will Probably Have to Force 
the Occupying Forces Out!"] 
  [Text] The beginning of the education of the fourth 
generation to attend officers school at the Petar Zrinski 
Croatian Military College in Crnomerec, Zagreb, was celebrated 
on Thursday [16 June]. According to Brigadier Miroslav 
Jezercic, the college commander, this generation includes 400 
soldiers who have proven their abilities in the homeland war and 
will broaden their knowledge acquired in the war so as to 
discharge their future tasks with even more success. 
  The college cadets were addressed by Army General Janko 
Bobetko, the-Croatian Army chief of staff. He first remarked 
that among those attending the college there were members of the 
HVO [Croatian Defense Council], which is now part of the Army of 
the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation. 
  Then he pointed out that the members of the Croatian Army 
had 
caused several incidents in small towns, which sometimes even 
the directly responsible commanding officers had tried to cover 
up. 
  "Nothing will make the Croatian people as angry as 
impertinent and violent behavior by Croatian officers, because 
they do not expect it from them. Such actions will not get us 
very far. We should understand that many people have lost 
relatives and friends in the war, which is why they are 
sometimes depressed. However, the Croatian people have 
entrusted you with their sons, and you are responsible for them, 
and every wrong move that you make ruins the image of the 
Croatian Army. This is why discipline should constantly be 
increased and everything should be done to avoid such 
incidents," General Bobetko emphasized. 
  Speaking about the present situation in Croatia, the chief 
of 
staff said that the war was not over yet. "There are several 
hundred thousand people who are still not in their homes, and 
they have been demanding increasingly often to return to their 
towns, so we will probably have to force the occupying forces 
out of Croatian territory. What we attack we absolutely must 
occupy, because there can be no more excuses. Therefore, learn 
as much as possible so that you can carry out all the tasks that 
you will be assigned," General Bobetko told the cadets at the 
officers school. 
  "No one has the right to a position for which they are not 
qualified any longer, and there will be no more cheating as 
there was at the beginning of the war, when the Croatian Army 
consisted of volunteers. There will be no more leniency or 
arbitrariness. The enemy, with whom we will square our 
accounts, must know that the Croatian Army is capable of 
carrying out anything that it is asked to. We have a lot of 
work ahead of us," said General Bobetko at the end of his speech.

  [Text] The censure motion [against the Vacaroiu 
government] presented today during the joint session of 
Romania's Parliament by the opposition condemns the economic and 
financial policy promoted by the executive, which leads to the 
perpetuation and deepening of the crisis. Similarly, the 
censure motion points out that the policy of the Nicolae 
Vacaroiu government runs counter to national interests by 
deliberately ignoring the developing of certain strategic 
sectors, which has disastrous consequences for the future of the 
country. The government is also accused of not observing its 
own government program. 
  As a consequence of all this, the signatories of the censure 
motion appeal to all senators and Chamber of Deputies members to 
join them and express by vote their lack of confidence in the 
current government. The censure motion was signed by 141 
senators and Chamber of Deputies members. 
  Immediately following the presentation of the text of the 
censure motion and of the list of the parliamentarians who 
signed it, the parliamentary faction of the Liberal Party 1993 
[PL-93] suggested that the Thursday [30 June] debates on the 
censure motion should be carried live by national television. 
They suggested this because the permanent bureaus of the two 
chambers of Parliament had expressed an contrary opinion. 
  Submitted to vote, the PL-93 parliamentary faction's 
proposal 
that the Thursday debates of parliament should be carried by 
television was rejected by 138 votes against, 160 in favor, and 
41 abstentions, as the proposal was not supported by a majority 
of the 407 parliamentarians who attended today's session, our 
correspondent reports.

  [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, received today General Michael 
Rose, commander of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, at his request. Army General Rasim Delic, 
chief of staff of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, and Viktor 
Andreyev, chief of the UNPROFOR civilian sector for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, also attended the talks. General Rose 
complained about the increase in the number of attacks on 
UNPROFOR by both sides. 
  President Izetbegovic said that our policy is full 
cooperation with UNPROFOR, and that everything will be done to 
provide them with normal conditions for work. He stressed that 
the cease-fire had to hold on the entire territory of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not partially, as it suits the 
aggressor. Military observers for the monitoring of the 
cease-fire should be deployed in a reciprocal fashion on both 
our and the aggressors' side, but the presence of the 
aggressor's liaison officers on our territory is unacceptable. 
  General Rose said that intensive work was under way in 
Gorazde to solve the problems with the return of the population 
to their homes in the zone within 3 km. Asked by Rose about the 
possibility of extending the cease-fire for another four weeks, 
President Izetbegovic said that this would depend on the 
progress made in the political negotiations.

    [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers on 23 and 24 June 
publish reports on objections voiced by some coalition deputies 
against Milan Janicina, minister for the administration and 
privatization of national property, and reactions to calls for 
Janicina's resignation from his post. 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 23 June on page 2 carries a 
600-word "asa"-signed report entitled "Deputies of the Coalition 
Party of the Democratic Left Want To Call on Milan Janicina To 
Resign." The report states: "Yesterday's meeting of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic Privatization Committee 
dealt with the problem of whether Milan Janicina should be 
called upon to resign from the post of minister for the 
administration and privatization of national property. Members 
of this committee have received additional documentation 
pertaining to the `House of Culture Atrium-Ruzinov' affair, in 
which Milan Janicina was involved as commercial lawyer and, 
according to some indications, placed [his client's] commercial 
interests above the interests of the state. Deputies for the 
Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] (Zselenak, Plesnik), the 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (Tomecek), and the Slovak 
National Party (Kona) proposed that the committee pass a 
resolution recommending that Milan Janicina resign from his 
post, in view of the `strength of the arguments.' This course 
of action was opposed by deputies for the government coalition 
and the Hungarian coalition (Durana, Pollak, Pribula, Komlosy). 
They argued that, at the very least, one must wait for the 
ruling of the court, which is now dealing with the case, and ask 
the Bar Association for its standpoint. At the same time, they 
were pointing out that, if Milan Janicina committed any mistake, 
this happened long before he became minister." According to the 
report, the committee finally decided to suspend the debate on 
the minister's case until 28 June. 
  On the same day, on page 1, Bratislava SME in Slovak carries 
a 200-word interview with SDL Deputy Chairman Milan Ftacnik by 
Jana Pankovcinova entitled "Milan Ftacnik Does Not Rule Out That 
the Question of Replacing Minister Janicina Will Be Raised." In 
the interview, the place and date of which are not given, 
Ftacnik is asked to respond to rumors that "the Coalition 
Council has dealt with the person of Privatization Minister 
Milan Janicina" and that "the prevailing view is that he should 
be replaced in this post by SDL Deputy J. Plesnik." While 
Ftacnik concedes that privatization issues have been discussed 
by the Coalition Council, he asserts that "no coalition partner 
has officially raised the issue" of replacing Janicina. As 
Ftacnik adds, however, "I cannot rule out that this issue may 
still be raised." 
  Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June on pages 1 and 2 carries 
a 300-word "vec"-signed report entitled "Minister Janicina: 
Csino Is a Pretext; They Want To Recall Me Because I Refuse To 
Accommodate Bolshevik Managements." Responding to the calls of 
some members of the parliamentary privatization committee for 
his resignation, Janicina tells an unidentified SME 
correspondent: "Although committee members speak about the 
strength of arguments, in reality I do not know even one of 
their arguments." Janicina stresses that his only role in the 
"Atrium" affair was that of a commercial lawyer who gave legal 
assistance to his client, Mr. Viliam Csino, and helped him 
overrule the court's original verdict on the privatization of 
the "Atrium" building in Bratislava-Ruzinov. The minister 
wonders why he should be attacked for having been a "good 
defense council" and attributes the efforts to recall him to his 
"refusal to accommodate Bolshevik managements." 
  Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 24 June on page 2 carries a 
500-word TA SR report entitled "Milan Janicina Will Not Resign 
from His Post." The report notes that, at a meeting on 23 June, 
the Executive Committee of the National Democratic Party [NDS], 
of which Janicina is a member, expressed "support" for the 
minister and "deplored public attacks on him from a coalition 
partner." The NDS Executive Committee considers the attacks on 
Janicina "incompetent" and "contradicting the ethics of 
coalition cooperation," the report says. The PRAVDA report also 
quotes Minister Janicina as having told the TA SR that he will 
not resign. According to PRAVDA, in the interview for the TA 
SR, Janicina challenged the authority of the parliamentary 
privatization committee to judge the legal aspects of the 
privatization of the Atrium building and reiterated that he was 
not representing the interests of the state in the case but, 
rather, those of a private client: "If someone claims that I 
placed the commercial interest [of my client] above the 
interests of the state, he is either an idiot or he 
demagogically twists the truth," Janicina is quoted as having 
said. 
  The dispute between SDL members of the parliamentary 
privatization committee and Minister Janicina is also the 
subject of a 700-word Alica Strbava commentary entitled "Juraj 
Plesnik's Moral Mimicry," in Bratislava SME in Slovak on 24 June 
on page 4. In Strbava's opinion, the true cause of the dispute 
must be sought in the different privatization ideas of the 
SDL-controlled Ministry of Economy and the NDS-controlled 
Ministry of Privatization. Strbava says: "It is a public secret 
that the Union of Industry is very favorably disposed toward the 
SDL, as is evidenced by the appointment of Peter Magvasi, a 
member of the Union of Industry, to the post of minister of 
economy. However, the Union of Industry was also favorably 
disposed toward former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. According 
to information from behind the scenes, Meciar had promised to 
the Union's representatives--that is, to the directors of the 
most important Slovak industrial companies (the Union of 
Industry comprises some 450 companies)--10 to 12 percent of the 
companies' shares, allegedly under very favorable terms. The 
present privatization minister, Milan Janicina, does not even 
want to hear about the fulfillment of this promise, which, 
naturally, does not play into the hands of the SDL."

  [Text] Belgrade, 27 Jun (TANJUG) -- ``The Government of the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] expresses utmost concern 
over a dangerous deterioration of the situation in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina caused by constant offensive actions by the 
Muslim-Croat forces. The FRY Government expects that the UN 
Security Council [UNSC] will without delay take appropriate 
measures to prevent consequences that further negative 
developments could have on the peace process in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  ``At this crucial time it is a prime responsibility and 
obligation of the UNSC to ensure that a realistic chance to 
reach a peaceful solution of the conflict in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina is not missed. If, however, this opportunity 
is missed, this would bring about an inevitable escalation of 
the conflict with all unforseeable consequences,'' a statement 
by the FRY Government, made available to TANJUG, says. It adds: 
  ``The FRY Government finds the current stage of the 
negotiations, which should lead to a solution of the crisis 
caused by the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, crucial. 
Active participation of the most important international powers 
-- the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia -- in the 
search for a lasting political solution, acceptable to all three 
sides in the conflict, gives rise to hope that this tragic civil 
war will soon be stopped, which would in turn create conditions 
for the resolution of some other important questions in the 
former Yugoslavia. 
  ``The FRY Government expects that full advantage will be 
taken of the current favorable period and is making efforts 
towards contributing in a concrete manner to this effect. 
Motivated by the desire to have a lasting peace in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina reached as soon as possible, the FRY 
Government has welcomed the recent agreement on ending military 
operations between the belligerent parties in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, an agreement on overall and 
lasting cease-fire would be a real proof that all parties in the 
conflict are indeed committed to a lasting, just peace and a 
political solution to the crisis. 
  ``All the developments that ensued following the signing of 
the agreement on 10 June 1994 indicate that not all sides in 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina wish to accept a peaceful solution. 
The setting- up of the Muslim-Croat federation in former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina flared up ambitions of the radical Muslim 
leadership in former Bosnia-Herzegovina to persist in its 
orientation for a military settlement. Relying on the 
unprecedented media support based on untruths, and also on a 
strong support lent by certain international circles, the 
Muslim-Croat side has been abusing the agreement on the 
cessation of military operations and has openly been preparing a 
large-scale military offensive, which is confirmed in UNPROFOR 
[UN Protection Forces] reports. These reports show, among other 
things, that the Muslim-Croat forces, despite the current 
embargo, have been allowed an unhindered supply of a large 
quantity of the most up-to- date weapons. All the activities of 
the Muslim-Croat side involving regrouping forces and other 
offensive actions, by which the signed agreement is violated, 
are hereby most vehemently condemned by the FRY Government. 
  ``The regrouping of their forces, with the continuous 
intensification of armed activities aimed at provoking the 
continuation of the war, represent a flagrant violation of the 
concluded agreement and can seriously threaten all efforts 
hitherto made to restore peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
The Muslim- Croat forces recently began carrying out heavy 
offensive actions against the Bosnian Serb positions, their 
towns, along almost all frontlines, which has caused numerous 
civilian casualties and huge material damage. 
  ``Despite all the aforementioned, it is encouraging that the 
Bosnian Serb forces have so far retaliated in a restrained 
manner to the Muslim-Croat offensive actions, thus preventing 
the current military operations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina 
from turning into a conflict of widest proportions. 
  "The FRY Government this time again wishes to stress that a 
permanent peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina can be achieved 
through negotiations alone, and is calling on the international 
community to exert pressure and demand from those violating the 
agreed cease-fire to halt their military activities immediately 
and accept peace as the only option without delay," the Yugoslav 
Government's statement says in conclusion.

  [Text] Zagreb, June 27 (TANJUG) -- Croatian Army Chief of 
Staff Janko Bobetko said United Nations peacekeepers would be 
expelled unless they help Zagreb to impose its rule in the 
territory of the republic of Serb Krajina. The region became a 
United Nations protected area in March 1992 after having earlier 
declared independence from Croatia. The republic of Serb 
Krajina's late 1991 declaration of independence followed 
Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia and the removal of Serb 
national rights from the Croatian Constitution. 
  Speaking in Sisak near the border with Serb Krajina, Gen. 
Bobetko said Zagreb would expel the peacekeepers if they did not 
help reintegrate the Krajina region into Croatia, the Croatian 
press wrote Monday. "Croatia will in that case do it alone," 
said Bobetko. 
  Under a plan proposed by former U.N. envoy Cyrus Vance, 
UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] forces were to remain in the 
Krajina region until a political settlement was achieved between 
Croatia and the republic of Serb Krajina. Croatia, which does 
not recognize the Serb republic, considers the region "occupied 
territory" and has attacked it in three offensives since March 
1992. 
  Bobetko and Tomislav Mercep, a ruling Croatian Democratic 
Union member of the Croatian Parliament, have announced plans 
for a new offensive on the Serb republic. Mercep is the leader 
of a Croatian paramiltary formation that has been accused by 
Serb officials of committing numerous war crimes. 
  The Croatian press quoted Mercep as saying he would organize 
Zagreb demonstrations in September by about 100,000 members of 
the Croatian Army and police "ready to liberate all occupied 
Croatian territories." 
  "If the Serbs refuse to accept Croatia's Constitution, I 
will 
personally issue an order to liberate Knin and so devastate it 
that no two stones will be left standing on top of one another," 
said Mercep at a recent meeting in the Port of Pula. 
  During the 1991-1992 Croatian war of secession, Mercep led a 
500- member special police unit that was reported to have killed 
at least 2,500 Serb civilians in western Slavonia.

<F P=106> ["Communique on the Assassination Attempt in Constanta and </F>
the Threat to President Ion Iliescu's Life" issued by the 
Greater Romania Party -- place and date not given] 
  [Text] The Greater Romania Party [PRM] publicly protests 
the exceptionally grave events that took place on 3 June 1994 in 
the Municipality of Constanta. Being invited to hold our weekly 
news conference at the headquarters of the Constanta branch of 
PRM, we travelled there by airplane. Upon our arrival at 
Kogalniceanu Airport, we were met by the Constanta County 
prefect, Mr. Anghel Constantinescu, who reassured us that in 
spite of the fact that there were certain brawling groups of 
people, the situation was under control. Being invited by the 
prefect and a number of county council members to pay a protocol 
visit to the Prefect's Office headquarters, we found that there 
were approximately 1,000 agitators there, who were blocking the 
entrance gate and maintained an atmosphere of terror. We used 
the backstairs to enter the prefect's office building, but after 
only a few minutes the prefect's office was stormed by a few 
dozen hooligans, stinking of alcohol, who tried to force their 
way in through the doors and who were threatening to kill us. 
Answering our question inquiring about how it was possible that 
such aggressors could penetrate the prefect's office building, 
despite the presence of the riot police, several local officials 
told us that they had been encouraged and helped to fraudulently 
enter the building by Cornel Neagoe, the PNTCD [National Peasant 
Christian-Democratic Party] mayor of Constanta Municipality, 
Stelian Dutu, the chairman of the Constanta branch of the FSN 
[Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], who is also deputy 
chairman of the Constanta County Council, Alexandru Mihalcea, 
the local correspondent of daily ROMANIA LIBERA, and Ion Hasoti, 
an ultra-monarchist attorney. As a matter of fact, the four 
aforementioned prominent agitators of the opposition stood all 
along in the window of the mayor's office, encouraging and 
directing the insane mob in the street, who, their eyes blurred 
with beastly fury and brandishing chains, crowbars, and knives, 
were shouting as loud as they could: "Death for death!," 
"Blood for blood!," and "Get that hangman!" 
  As the situation was desperate and the county prefect seemed 
to be overwhelmed by the events, the PRM chairman [Senator 
Corneliu Vadim Tudor] telephoned Bucharest, where he spoke with 
Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Senate Speaker Oliviu Gherman, 
and with Interior Minister Doru Ioan Taracila. Within a short 
time the police forces were strengthened. Eventually the gang 
of hooligans, who had been occupying the hallways, left the 
prefect's office building. About 700 PRM sympathizers, who had 
gathered at the Culture Palace and were waiting for our news 
conference to begin, could hardly be restrained from heading for 
the prefect's office building, where -- in their rage at what 
was happening -- they would have pulverized that scum within a 
few minutes. Owing to those regrettable incidents in Constanta, 
under the circumstances of a nearly three-hour siege, Professor 
Mircea Musat suffered a heart attack and was unable to attend 
the news conference. We would like to mention that among the 
mob 50 rogues were spotted who had been brought there from 
Bucharest by bus, to act as a Hitler-type assault brigade. 
Under such circumstances the PRM demands that the Government 
and the General Prosecution should depose and prosecute, in 
emergency proceedings, the peasant-party mayor of Constanta, 
Cornel Neagoe, a paranoid individual who has publicly stated 
that if he had more authority, he would literally bulldoze all 
communists. It is obvious that owing to certain characters who 
cannot adapt to society, such as Mayor Cornel Neagoe, and 
[PNTCD] parliamentarians Vasile Vetisanu, Serban Sandulescu, or 
[PNTCD Chairman] Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD is actually an anti- 
national, anti-peasant, anti-Christian, and anti-democratic 
party. We also demand that all hooligans who, having occupied 
the supreme state institution of the county, threatened to kill 
the senators and deputies of our party, should be identified and 
placed under arrest. 
  It is alarming and regrettable that, owing to the 
inexplicably passive stance of the police and the justice 
ministry, gangs of insane people are able to block and hold in 
terror the fundamental institutions of the state: The 
Government, the Senate, the Chamber of Deputies, the Ministry of 
Interior, and the county prefect's offices. For the last time 
we publicly warn everyone that if there is no return to legality 
and Romanian society is not protected against such aggressive 
rottenness, our party, together with other healthy forces of the 
nation, will see themselves compelled to set up their own 
defense structures, as the lives of our parliamentarians, 
counselors, journalists, and ordinary party members are being 
threatened. 
  As far as concerns the recent communique of the FSN 
leadership, which they published a number of times and on radio 
and television [rejecting Tudor's earlier accusations that FSN 
leader Petre Roman was involved in a coup attempt against 
President Iliescu allegedly to take place on 17 June], the PRM 
has to point out the following: We believe that the FSN is not 
entitled to issue any more communiques, because in any country 
of the world, parties that have destroyed the country, parties 
that are swarming with all kinds of crooks and rowdies, would 
have been dissolved and each of its members would have been 
prosecuted long ago. Thus, with the same hand with which they 
wrote false declarations and forged public documents, with which 
they squandered our national patrimony, with which they sent 
abroad huge amounts in hard currency and made their relatives 
rich, some of the deputies of that drifting party are now 
requesting that the parliamentary immunity should be lifted of 
the PRM chairman whose sole fault is that of having revealed 
their crimes. 
  The recent escalation of tension was caused by the 
disclosures of an authentic revolutionary, who was gravely 
wounded in the blaze of the December 1989 events, made to us, 
the members of the PRM Steering Committee, who sign this 
document. Those disclosures were made on the morning of Friday, 
3 June, in the VIP foyer of Baneasa Airport, upon her own 
initiative, by Mrs. Maria Schiht, a member of a revolutionary 
organization, who before her recent retirement used to work at 
Romania's Senate. Here is what she stated to us: 
  "I have come to warn you that an attempt upon Senator Vadim 
Tudor is being plotted. Furthermore, Dorin Maxim, one of the 
leaders of the revolutionaries' organizations, recently 
disclosed to me that before 17 June, together with [Democratic 
Party-National Salvation Front leader] Petre Roman, they will 
assassinate President Ion Iliescu and will reinstall [King] 
Mihai de Hohenzollern as the head of the country." Considering 
the exceptional gravity of those assertions, we advised Maria 
Schiht, together with Flori Stoichitescu, her former colleague 
at the Senate, who was accompanying her, to request an audience 
at Cotroceni Palace with [presidential counselor for military 
issues] Colonel General Vasile Ionel and brief him on that 
potential violence. We know that their meeting took place. We 
invite the General Prosecution to commence serious 
investigations ex officio, as stipulated by law. 
  Under the aforementioned circumstances we request that Dorin 
Maxim should be immediately interrogated and that Petre Roman's 
parliamentary immunity should be lifted, as that is the sole way 
in which justice could precisely establish the nature of his 
relations with terrorist-extremist groupings planning to 
overturn state order by force. One cannot ignore the fact that 
some of the leaders of his party have forced their way through 
the lines of the law- enforcement bodies at the Alba Iulia Great 
Popular Assembly of 1 December 1993, which proves their 
anti-social habits. At the same time the PRM firmly requests 
that the General Prosecution should finance the completion and 
deal with the penal cases based on the thorough reports of the 
Prime Minister's Control Corps, cases referring to the 
infractions perpetrated by Petre Roman, Rada Istrate, Bogdan 
Niculescu-Duvaz, Traian Basescu, Bogdan Bujor Teodoroiu, 
Aristide Dragomir, Adrian Severin, Vasile Bran, and other FSN 
[National Salvation Front] leaders, who by their incompetence, 
amateurishness, greed, irresponsibility, and Mafia-type dealings 
have pushed the country to the bottom of the abyss. Once more, 
we sound the alarm so that public opinion at home and abroad 
should be entirely aware that the sole extremism currently 
practiced in Romania is the one perpetrated by the monarchist 
opposition and the FSN, who -- if we wish to prevent them from 
poisoning this nation -- should be outlawed as soon as possible.

<F P=106> [Report by Liviu Tudor: "KGB Agents Have Embarked Upon </F>
Aggressive Espionage Activity Against Romanian Intelligence 
Service Employees"] 
  [Text] With the support of their agencies in the Republic 
of Moldova, as well as those in our own country, especially in 
the northeastern region, the KGB has embarked upon a sustained 
campaign intended to disclose and gather documentary evidence 
with respect to the activity of the SRI [Romanian Intelligence 
Service] employees. Currently the D Division of the SRI, for the 
intelligence protection of SRI personnel, has several files with 
references to Russian surveillance activity and their attempts 
to penetrate the circles of SRI employees in the north-eastern 
part of Romania. The documents sent to the government and the 
presidency briefing them on these facts have been left without 
answer. 
  The collapse of the USSR in 1990 did not implicitly mean 
that 
the KGB's potential dropped as well. As neither its authority 
nor its influence at home or abroad has suffered setbacks, the 
KGB is trying to keep under control its zones of influence, and 
especially Romania. 
  Moscow does not like the ideas and the conception of the 
Romanian Armed Forces and certain political circles to integrate 
within NATO structures. The assertion made on 24 December 1992 
by the SRI director [Virgil Magureanu], in his speech occasioned 
by the Day of Antiterrorist Fighters, according to which "the 
Romanian Intelligence Service should involve itself more in 
Romania's reunification with Bessarabia," was a further signal 
that caused concern at Russian secret service headquarters. 
  Two years after this statement, during a news conference 
organized in the month of March 1994, SRI Director Virgil 
Magureanu hinted that the most aggressive intelligence service 
currently acting on Romania's territory is the KGB.

<F P=106> [Speech by President Arpad Goncz to a session of the new </F>
National Assembly in Budapest -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed House, my dear friends: I respectfully 
welcome you, the freely and democratically elected deputies of 
the new Hungarian Republic's second National Assembly. 
  First, let me point out with praise -- I hope that you agree 
-- that the indisputable fact that the 1994 parliamentary 
elections were held on time, in a fair manner and, as regards 
its implementation, faultlessly and smoothly, proves the 
strength and maturity of our democracy. The high turnout in the 
two rounds proves our nation's interest in the shaping of its 
own fate and a resolute intent and consciousness in expressing 
its political opinion. Grateful acknowledgments are due to all 
the voters, the leaders and the parties' parliamentary 
candidates who took part in the elections, the leaders of the 
National Election Committee, which organized the elections -- 
and by name, particularly Dr. Prof. Janos Nemeth -- and its 
members, all leaders and members of the local election 
committees, the National Election Office, which prepared the 
elections -- by name, Zoltan Toth and Dr. Ilona Palfy -- and 
their excellent colleagues, all staff of the Ministry of 
Interior and of the local governments who took part in the 
election work, and all those thousands of voluntary workers 
without the generous contribution of whom we would not be able 
to sit here today. 
  Let me also thank the six parliamentary parties' designated 
deputies for the series of talks, which was completed within a 
short time and which required mutual good will and flexibility, 
with which they prepared today's founding session, together with 
the expert support of the National Assembly's secretary 
general's office and the National Assembly's office. I feel 
that this series of talks projects the new National Assembly's 
resolute work style, which is expected to be ready for 
interparty coordination. 
  The National Assembly is our country's highest 
constitutional 
body which is answerable to the people of the country -- and let 
me add, to the future of the country -- for its legislative 
work. It performs its work under the nation's eye and hearing; 
and what it passes determines our daily life. Its base is the 
past, its test is the present, and its judge is the future. 
Voters pass judgment on it every day, even though they will 
express their collective opinion only in four years' time, at 
the next elections. 
  No one can cast doubt on the legitimacy of your work. 
However, you have to fight for its recognition day by day during 
the debates with your words and votes. It depends on you how 
the citizens of the country -- Hungarians and non-Hungarians -- 
pass judgment on the functioning of our democracy. And not only 
our country's citizens, but Hungarians throughout the world, our 
compatriots living beyond the borders, who are not linked to us 
by legal ties, but by the past, the common language and culture, 
as well as by the millions of threads of a common fate and by 
their vital interests. 
  I ask you not to forget for a second that the legislative 
work and responsibility of the National Assembly do not raise 
you above the country, society, but oblige you to serve it. The 
whole of the National Assembly and each of its members are 
undissoluble members of society. Although it shapes society 
unceasingly, at the same time it changes, itself, and it is a 
mirror of society. Although most of the National Assembly's 
legislative work is embodied in legal form, in everyday life it 
turns into human and economic relations. What directly follows 
from this is that an indispensable tool and real breeding ground 
in your daily work is the thorough knowledge of the unmasked 
social reality. No ideology can substitute this. 
  It is not my task to sum up or simply to try and refer to 
the 
experiences of the four-years' work of the previous National 
Assembly. I will not answer the question, which keeps being 
raised, whether the nation voted for or against something. 
However, I can safely say that it voted for a future it expects 
to come, and that it wants to look forward to a certain, 
predictable and peaceful future. As soon as possible. A 
future, which takes it ahead in time, not back. It is ready to 
bring over to its future as much from the past -- any past -- as 
is necessary to make the future more stable, in a social and 
economic sense, in accordance with its moral value judgment. 
  The natural wisdom of the nation demands social justice, 
sober equality of opportunities; it does not expect miracles or 
wait for plums to fall into its mouth. However, what it expects 
is palpable good intention, true words, dialogue, a say in the 
fate of property and fairness in public life. You can be sure 
that the nation will recognize this, or the opposite of this, in 
words, in ink or on screen. 
  My recent discussions with the leaders of the six 
parliamentary parties and the tough debates and the outcome of 
the coalition negotiations convinced me that both the future 
government coalition and the future opposition parties are well 
aware of the country's problems, our tasks, which are not easy, 
and they form a similar opinion of the priorities of the 
National Assembly's tasks. Thus, they are ready for a fruitful 
dialogue and for constructive debates and cooperation. 
  Finally, I ask God to bless the work of the National 
Assembly. From my heart I wish, for all members of the House, 
that what they do as parliamentary deputies should turn to the 
advantage of our country, even when measured by the strictest 
judgment of their conscience.

  [Excerpts] Dear listeners, our guest is Zoltan Gal, new 
speaker of the Hungarian National Assembly. [passage omitted] 
We have received several phone calls. One of the callers asked 
about the law on former agents. 
  [Gal] I cannot say just now. The fact is that the law will 
become effective from 1 July, but in my view it will be 
impossible to implement because the parliamentary committee 
elected by the previous parliament is not sufficient to start 
work, since the law prescribes more than one committee. Nor do 
I know when this parliament will have the time to select further 
committees -- after a due selection process. This is one side 
of the issue. 
  However, another reason why we should not hurry in this 
matter is that I am convinced this law is unconstitutional and, 
in practice, unworkable. It would be best if the Constitutional 
Court could rule on this question as soon as possible -- as far 
as I know the law has been referred to the Constitutional Court 
-- because its ruling will be significant in resolving this 
situation.

<F P=106> [Report by Zoltan Gal, Tibor J. Keri, and Attila Zsoldos: </F>
"Ministerial Plans From Bekesi, Through Keleti, to Kuncze"] 
  [Text] At today's founding session of parliament, Gyula 
Horn, prime minister-designate of the Hungarian Socialist Party 
[MSZP], is expected to receive instructions from President Arpad 
Goncz to form a government. As a result of the coalition 
agreement, the members of the new government have become known. 
We interviewed the future ministers on their plans. 
  Finance Minister Designate Laszlo Bekesi would first like to 
gain an accurate view of the current balance of payments, the 
situation of state finances, the payment obligations to run into 
the second half of the year, and the projected revenues. It can 
be stated with great certainty that, after the snapshot 
inventory, the financial processes for 1994 will have to be 
corrected regarding both the budget and the exchange rate and 
interest rate policy, Bekesi said. As an example, he mentioned 
the promise of an 8 percent increase of pensions for which the 
funds have not yet been found. 
  Bela Katona, the expected person for the position of 
minister 
without portfolio supervising the civilian secret services, did 
not accept his nomination easily. He said he had to assess the 
political weight and confidential nature of this position. 
After gathering information in his new position, Katona sees 
putting the employees of the office at ease as his most 
important task: There will not be any kind of major clean-up. 
He stressed that there will be no dismissals even under the 
heading of reorganization because they would like, by all means, 
to keep the experts in the services. 
  Katona wishes to "lobby" the government so that the services 
receive the necessary budgetary support. He also strives to 
make the public aware that the secret services operate in the 
interests of the country. 
  According to Laszlo Kovacs, the foreign minister designate 
of 
the new government, the main directions of Hungarian foreign 
policy will not change in the future, either. These are 
integration with Europe, gaining full European Union membership 
as a result of a longer process; making peace with our 
neighbors, Slovakia, Romania, and the Yugoslav Federation; and 
support for Hungarian minorities over the border in the interest 
of their rights becoming recognized in accordance with European 
norms. He added that none of the three directions will be 
subordinated to the other. He added that foreign political 
thinking will change in the sense that it will be based solely 
on rational elements: On Hungary's circumstances, interests, 
and on coordinating the interests of Hungary and the partner 
countries, rather than on a historical sense of mission, the 
injuries suffered in the historical past, or ideological 
sympathies and antipathies, he said. Talking about 
Hungarian-Russian relations, he said that they are very 
important for us because Russia is the region's biggest power. 
  In connection with the Foreign Ministry's staffing, he said 
that a good quality foreign policy planning and analysis 
department should be reestablished in the Ministry. At the same 
time, Kovacs would like to put the diplomatic service members at 
ease: He wants to rely on all experts, regardless of when and 
why they entered the foreign service. "I will not examine 
whether the members were placed in their positions because of 
being a former school mate, relative, or friend of someone three 
years ago; if their professional and human qualities make them 
suitable to perform their tasks, then I expect them to remain in 
their jobs," Kovacs said. At the same time, he added that those 
ambassadors who were on the Hungarian Democratic Forum's list at 
the elections will themselves have to carry the consequences. 
  According to Gyorgy Keleti, the MSZP's defense minister 
designate, the most important task of the initial period is to 
set up an expert committee. This body would assess the army's 
situation, the combat-readiness of the various army units, and 
the living conditions of the regular staff. Parallel to this, 
the army's budget will also have to be examined because, 
according to some information, the army might become insolvent 
by autumn, and this has to be avoided by all means, Keleti said. 
In his view, a crisis-management program has to be drawn up 
within a very short time, and they have to to begin to establish 
a rational army structure. In Keleti's view, the decree 
ordering the merger of the Ministry and the army's command has 
to be withdrawn. The deadlines prescribed in this decree cannot 
be adhered to, and it also has to be decided whether the Defense 
Ministry and the army's command need to be merged, he said. 
  For Justice Minister Designate Pal Vastagh, the coalition 
agreement determines his tasks for the near future. He has to 
draw up a law on legislation that lays down a more professional 
and better-founded responsibility of legislation. The law on 
ministerial responsibility will have to be completed this year, 
and the coalition agreement also has tight deadlines for drawing 
up a constitution. Vastagh believes it important and urgent to 
confirm judicial independence, and to set up the National 
Judiciary Council. "I would like the Ministry to be a 
government-level intellectual center for legislation and 
codification," Vastagh said. 
  Mrs. Kosa Magda Kovacs, the labor affairs minister of the 
new 
government, said that the Ministry's basic task is to care for 
the unemployed and to improve the situation of people seeking 
jobs for the first time. The Ministry will have to try to help 
the unemployed find jobs. In the interest of this, the 
ministries will have to review the employment consequences of 
their own decisions every year. The minister designate 
emphasized that the two coalition parties do not have any 
differences of opinion on the need for an economic and social 
agreement. According to Mrs. Kosa, the trade unions, employees, 
and other organizations will have to be involved in the 
conciliation process. 
  Future environmental protection and area development 
minister Ferenc Baja sees the drawing up of the environmental 
protection law as his first task, and he considers professional 
and political consensus necessary for it to be accepted. He 
said that the overlaps in the ministries' tasks have to be 
clarified, he mentioned water affairs and forestry as examples. 
On 25 June, Baja met representatives of the Green 
organizations. So far, Baja has mainly gained professional 
experience in area development but, according to him, confidence 
was established at the meeting, which provides the opportunity 
for cooperation with the environmentalist organizations. The 
Green movements see Political State Secretary Designate Katalin 
Szili as a recognized expert, and they appreciate that Baja, as 
deputy chairman of the MSZP, might be able to gain more room for 
maneuver in the government for the Environmental Ministry. 
"They expect me to use my political influence to the benefit of 
environmental protection, and this is what I will do," he said. 
  Industry and Trade Minister Designate Laszlo Pal's ministry 
will be formed from the merger of the Ministry of International 
Economic Relations, the National Technical Development 
Committee, and the Industry Ministry. Pal has set two goals for 
himself: To improve industry's ability to export, and to 
improve the country's export market positions toward the East 
and the West. He said that the predecessors left the energy 
prices to be settled by the new government. In order to secure 
the future of energy supplies in Hungary, the prices will have 
to be increased. However, such measures will only be brought by 
the government if the most needy people get compensated. 
  According to Welfare Minister Designate Pal Kovacs, his 
first 
tasks are to improve the situation of hospitals on the brink of 
bankruptcy, and to change the system of hospital referrals of 
patients. The government has to come to an agreement with the 
social security fund on the transfer of assets and the issue of 
pensions. The sections of the welfare law that exclude 
precisely the poorest people from the provisions will also have 
to be amended. Kovacs would like to extend the child-rearing 
allowance and make it a basic citizens' right. "I would like a 
ministry with a simpler structure, where medical expertise is 
not the only factor and which has a bigger influence in society 
and within the government," Kovacs said. 
  Laszlo Lakos, agricultural minister designate of the Horn 
government, said that they have already agreed on the most 
important tasks with the coalition partner. First of all, 
producers have to be assisted in selling the expected high grain 
yields and, together with this, the establishment of financial 
resources for the autumn soil preparation and sowing jobs is 
also an urgent task. Amending the laws on cooperatives, the 
Agrarian Chamber, and the operation of the land-issuing 
committees is a legislative task. "We would like to gain the 
trust of producers and agricultural intellectuals by 
establishing a predictable support system and market 
environment," Lakos said. In his view, the Agricultural 
Ministry has to serve the interests of the agricultural lobby 
rather than party interests. 
  Interior Minister Designate Gabor Kuncze said that his first 
task after taking office will be preparing the amendment of the 
law on local governments. This is the most urgent task because 
the local government elections are to be held in the autumn. In 
this area, issues in connection with the direct election of 
mayors, the rights and spheres of authority of the mayor, the 
town clerk, and the panel of deputies, and the legal rules of 
directly electing the county bodies will have to be settled 
without delay. Submitting the police's service law is another 
task that cannot be delayed. The only question is, he said, 
whether this can be done within the framework of the unified 
regulation of the armed forces. If this cannot be done within a 
short time, then the police's service law has to be submitted to 
Parliament separately. 
  Kuncze met [Interior Minister] Imre Konya in the Interior 
Ministry and they prepared a list of the issues to be handed 
over. They agreed that the minister still in office will give 
notice to his colleagues in the cabinet who are in confidential 
positions. However, the leader of the cabinet will, for a short 
while, assist the new minister in taking over the current issues 
after he takes office.

<F P=106> [Article by Katalin Bossanyi: "Bekesi's Battles"] </F>
  [Text] Laszlo Bekesi is a very good economist. In addition, 
he has a sense of humor and a healthy dose of cynicism, which 
are necessary to make life tolerable. Now he has also 
demonstrated that he is not motivated by ambitions of high 
office and considerations of personal prestige. Lately he has 
declared repeatedly that he would prefer to stay out of the 
future government if it is not a coalitional one. For only with 
such wider social support does he see any chance for the 
realization of the MSZP's [Hungarian Socialist Party's] economic 
program--and let us add immediately: at least to the same 
extent, for the realization of the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free 
Democrats] economic program as well. 
  That is a very honorable position of principle. But, in the 
opinion of many people, it is not good politics. 
  After all, the MSZP and the SZDSZ will be making their final 
decision only this weekend on whether to start coalition talks 
and, if so, with whom. The government program, including its 
economic conceptual plan, will be the decisive element in the 
negotiations, and the subsequent bargaining over organizations 
and appointments will follow from it. But it does not seem to be 
a good tactical solution to make public in advance that one is 
not in the running. Moreover, it smacks a bit of blackmail, just 
as Balint Magyar's much publicized declaration did earlier. That 
is why many people, both within and outside the MSZP, tend to 
regard Bekesi's move as desertion. 
  I believe that Bekesi's present, kamikaze-like move deserves 
to be judged on the basis of its local worth. That is why I am 
inclined to regard the renowned economist's statement as a 
warning cry of danger, rather than a selfish excuse. 
  The persons to whom this warning cry is being addressed can 
be found in the leadership and among the rank and file of the 
Free Democrats, as well as of the Socialists. For what was 
Laszlo Bekesi's actual "message"? That the economy cannot be 
stabilized without a coalition. 
  That is plain speech. For the point here is not who gets 
which post or what the relationship between the two parties will 
be. It is the state of the economy today and tomorrow--or to 
make it more readily understandable, the future of each and 
every one of us. Of course, we might be skeptical of anyone who 
cites a wider horizon of interests in support of his case. But 
insincere pathos is not typical of the renowned economist. He 
does not want to use the people as an excuse or to reason in 
their stead, because he believes that not even the ample vote 
the MSZP received empowers it to do so. He presumably recognized 
long ago that the people are unwilling to simply accept further 
fiscal restraint, curtailment of demand, or the social sphere's 
direct exposure to market forces. They are willing to tolerate 
such necessary measures only if they get something in exchange. 
For instance, controllable guarantees for the reconciliation of 
interests, and some compensation for the most vulnerable social 
groups. With a large degree of simplification, that is Bekesi's 
economic program. It is neither liberal nor a collection of 
social solutions. Instead, it is crisis management based on 
harsh reality. Specifically in the interest of maintaining 
social peace, however, the program would (socially) cushion to 
some extent the impact of painful economic measures. That would 
not yet make the program more popular, but merely more tolerable. 
  It could be argued, of course, that Bekesi has not assessed 
the situation correctly; that the state of the economy is not so 
ominous, and therefore there is also a softer, easier, and 
socially more tolerable way of putting the economy in order than 
what Bekesi is offering. But not even Bekesi's opponents are 
resorting to this argument. Today the outgoing finance minister 
already admits that he has confidence in Bekesi. And the SZDSZ 
program for crisis management, discounting minor differences, 
urges the same solutions as "the program hallmarked with 
Bekesi's name." Consequently, if the SZDSZ refuses to join the 
coalition and rejects economic cooperation with the MSZP, then 
it also refuses to accept responsibility for the realization of 
its own economic conceptual plan (either because it has no 
confidence in the plan's success or is afraid of its 
consequences). This is what the Socialists' leading economist is 
calling to the Free Democrats' attention now, before the 
decision that is to be made this weekend. 
  And how can Bekesi's message be decoded within his own 
party? 
  My interpretation of the message is as follows: Bekesi does 
not fear that, if there should be no coalition in spite of 
everything, the MSZP would come under the influence of Sandor 
Nagy. A deal could be struck with the trade union leader; after 
all, the chairman of the MSZOSZ [National Federation of 
Hungarian Trade Unions] is a political realist. But Bekesi does 
fear--and not without cause--that, under one-party rule, a 
government of technocrats would not evolve. Several well-known 
economists, who could come into consideration, have already 
indicated that they would be willing to accept public office 
only if there is a coalition. Their motives are similar to 
Bekesi's: Crisis management requires the widest possible public 
support. Under a shaky government it would not be possible to 
implement long-overdue reforms that cannot be delayed any 
longer. And if the team were recruited from the "second string," 
or perhaps from truly "old cadres," the government could wobble 
along for a time, but the economy's decline could not be 
stopped, and an MSZP government would travel essentially the 
same road as the failed MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]. 
  I fully understand that the economic expert does not wish to 
assist in this. And if the SZDSZ refuses to shoulder the 
responsibility of government, then I agree with his decision. 
Even in the economy, the coming years will not be the era of 
solitary heroes. What we need now is teamwork. Within the 
framework of a coalition. Under well-balanced conditions, in 
other words.

  [Text] The number of registered unemployed continued to 
fall in May. This transpires from the statistics published by 
the National Labor Affairs Center. The district centers 
registered 570,600 unemployed in the fifth month of 1994, some 
22,000 fewer than in April 1994. Thus, unemployment fell to 
11.4 percent from the 11.8 percent in April. 
  The number of registered unemployed has been steadily 
falling 
for more than a year, and the latest fall was the biggest so 
far. According to the Center's statistics, there were 100,000 
more unemployed in May 1993 than in May 1994. Together with the 
newly registered people starting their careers, the Center 
registered 33,400 new unemployed in May; at the same time, 
55,600 people were taken off the unemployment list. Like the 
national trend, unemployed fell in the counties too. The fall 
in unemployment even exceeded 5 percent in the Veszprem, Somogy, 
Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen, Heves, and Zala counties. The smallest 
fall in unemployment occurred in the Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg and 
Fejer counties, and in Budapest. 
  Demand for manpower increased by 4 percent compared with 
April, with employers offering 70,800 jobs in May 1994. Job 
opportunities increased in the construction industry but 
continued to fall in the agricultural sector and in industry, 
and did not change in the other sectors. A total of 74 economic 
units announced in May that they were planning lay-offs, 
affecting a total of 4,240 jobs. This is 40 percent fewer than 
the forecasts made in April. Together with the predictions made 
in previous months, a total of 24,000 employees are expected to 
lose their jobs in the near future. 
  A total of 230,300 people were receiving unemployment 
benefit 
at the end of May 1994; the non-social form of this benefit was 
used by 279,000 people in May. According to the data from the 
last day, 20 May, there were 149,000 unemployed who were not 
receiving any kind of unemployment benefit. 
  The total average sum of unemployment benefit and support 
for 
people beginning their career stood at 10,658 forints in May. 
Some 48.7 percent of the unemployed were receiving less than 
9,000 forints.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Permanent State Assets"] </F>
  [Text] Regardless of how hard the government tried to 
privatize them, the state farms have failed to attract 
investors. New nameplates have been installed. Behind the 
appealing corporate names, however, the state remains the owner. 
While the fertile Hungarian soil failed to impress the 
anticipated investors, the state farms have been losing their 
assets continually and at a fast rate. 
  Years ago, 121 state farms were being considered for 
privatization. The government decided at the time that 26 of the 
state farms would remain permanently state-owned. (Primarily the 
preservation and development of biological stocks were the 
justification for this decision.) The rest of the state farms 
were to be privatized. State-farm managers, many of whom have 
been replaced in the meantime, prepared plans for transforming 
the state farms into corporations, and the State Property Agency 
[AVU] decided that their transformation was to be completed by 
December 1992. That in itself would not have meant 
privatization, but even the simple changing of nameplates failed 
to take place. 
  Experts were not surprised by the delay. For, according to 
the government's decision, the state farms were to be sold off 
in the course of so-called decentralized privatization. Simply 
stated, it meant that the state farms were to be split up into 
viable units, which would then be offered for sale. But there 
was no rush of prospective buyers. The primary reason for their 
lack of interest was that agriculture had been a declining 
branch of the economy for years, and therefore the new owners 
could not even hope to make a profit. Those who were the least 
bit confident of success were deterred by uncertainties 
regarding title to the land, and by the protracted settlement of 
compensation claims. 
  The government quickly corrected the situation. The deadline 
for transforming state farms into corporations was extended 
until 30 June 1993. In a legal sense, this program has been a 
success in that the management of every state farm was obliged 
to prepare, by the end of December 1993, all the documents 
necessary for retroactive incorporation. 
  The letterheads on the farms' stationery and the nameplates 
on the facades of the farms' office buildings attest to the 
state farms' transformation into corporations. But economic 
reality reveals something entirely different. Under 
decentralized privatization, 30 billion forints' [Ft] worth of 
assets were offered for sale, but only Ft15 billion worth have 
actually been transferred to new owners. Before the state farms' 
transformation into corporations, the book value of their assets 
totaled Ft93 billion, but only 47 percent of that amount is 
so-called subscribed capital. 
  According to a report reflecting the situation at the end of 
March, 98 of the 121 state farms have been transformed into 
corporations, 16 are in liquidation, and seven are in the 
distribution-of-assets stage. Among the state farms that have 
been transformed into corporations, seven are owned by domestic 
entrepreneurs and two are owned by German investors. The state 
farms' combined total capital stock is Ft76 billion, of which 
about Ft5 billion is privately owned. Thus the state continues 
to hold most of the capital stock. 
  The government has attempted once again to stimulate the 
farms' lagging privatization. The shares left in the AVU's 
portfolio are being put out to public tender; they can now be 
bought also for compensation notes; and enterprising 
agricultural workers also are able to buy shares. 
  There are several reason why no rush to buy shares can be 
expected. The farmland's future remains uncertain because of the 
slow processing of compensation claims, and it would be very 
amateurish to start raising livestock without any land. 
Agricultural workers are being deterred from buying shares 
presumably because they know very well that they cannot expect 
any dividend payments in the near future, and their small 
percentage of equity is not enough even to guarantee them their 
jobs. To add to the contradictions, it is common knowledge that 
agriculture in our country is not a sector in which tycoons 
invest, and that the rate of return on invested capital is slow 
even under favorable economic conditions. The paucity of capital 
could be bridged with loans, but then only the investors' 
grandchildren could hope to realize the profit. 
  The most spectacular contradiction in the privatization of 
state farms is that the decisionmakers were guided by political 
slogans, and they failed to take into consideration that 
investors count their forints.

  [Text] The National Coordinating Council of the SDS [Union 
of Democratic Forces] today discussed the resolution of the SDS 
parliamentary group analyzing the boycott of parliament and the 
negative assessment of a large number of SDS deputies on taking 
part in full parliamentary sessions on a selective basis. In 
the view of the National Coordinating Council, in the future 
authorized members of the SDS parliamentary group should enter 
the plenary hall of parliament to represent SDS interests. 
Today the SDS deputies hotly debated their strategy for three 
hours, but failed to reach any decision. 
  The Ecoglasnost National Movement has disseminated an 
address 
in which it declares that it supports the decision adopted by 
the Sixth SDS National Conference to boycott parliament and 
conduct extraparliamentary actions.

  [Text] The Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] Press Center 
has reported that President Zhelyu Zhelev today met with a group 
of National Assembly deputies of the BSP, who handed him a 
petition with the signatures of 122 deputies from all the 
political parties represented in parliament requesting him to 
pardon Georgi Atanasov and Stoyan Ovcharov [prime minister and 
minister of economics and planning in final years of Zhivkov 
regime], who are now serving prison sentences. According to the 
BSP deputies, when President Zhelev has discussed the material 
evidence submitted on the state of health of the two prisoners 
and considered the signatories to the petition, he should decide 
to sign a decree pardoning the two former state officials. The 
group of deputies found that the president showed understanding 
for their request and expect a favorable result to the petition 
in the very near future. 
  According to a second fax we received from the Presidency, 
the Press Center of the Presidency makes the following 
announcement in connection with the announcement by the BSP 
Press Center on the meeting between President Zhelyu Zhelev and 
a group of BSP deputies: Bulgarian President has received a 
petition handed to him requesting pardons for Georgi Atanasov 
and Stoyan Ovcharov.

  [Text] Tirana -- The development and current situation of 
the free press in Albania, based on the experience of Albanian 
journalists themselves, was the topic of a discussion held in 
the Palace of Congresses with a group of Albanian journalists 
representing various newspapers, organized by the delegation of 
European Democratic Union -- of which Professor Doctor Andreas 
Khol was a member. 
  Acknowledging the birth of a free press in Albania over the 
last few years, the journalists highlighted in their discussions 
the existence of a dual tendency: on the one hand, abuse of the 
freedom of the press and, on the other, efforts to restrict it. 
Some of the speakers pointed out that the media in general was 
still politicized, and the independent press remained a small 
minority. 
  It is precisely the latter -- having financial support from 
neither political forces nor government -- that is extremely 
endangered by the merciless law of insolvency of the market 
economy.

<F P=106> [Article by E. Ambrozic: "President Tudjman Is Ignoring the </F>
Istrian Reality"] 
  [Text] Pula -- "It is good that the main celebration to 
mark the Day of Antifascism in Croatia was held in Istria, for 
that proved the importance of the Istrian peninsula in this 
country," said Ivan Jakovcic, president of the IDS [Istrian 
Democratic Congress], at a news conference yesterday. He 
emphasized that antifascism made it possible for Istria to be 
joined to its native country. 
  Jakovcic said that President Tudjman could not have said a 
part of his speech delivered in Pazin on Wednesday anywhere else 
but in Istria, and that the speech was an attempt to restore the 
Croatian reputation in the world, which has been seriously 
tarnished. Jakovcic said that in Pazin President Tudjman had 
proved himself consistent in denying everything that Istria had 
achieved on its own. So it turned out, Jakovcic said, that 
Istrian fighters could not have managed anything without the 
help of fighters from other parts of Croatia, and that Istria 
had not done anything in the past 50 years. Furthermore, 
Jakovcic said that President Tudjman's speech implies that, in 
the future, Istria would only be able to achieve anything under 
the reign of the HDZ. 
  The IDS president is particularly worried that Franjo 
Tudjman 
is negating the election results in Istria, for he criticized 
the commitment of Istrian voters to regionalism, coexistence, 
and tolerance. 
  Jakovcic added that when the president of the Republic, who 
also happens to be a historian, uses false information and says 
that the Italians in Istria mostly supported Italian fascism, 
then that is a blatant lie. Jakovcic also said that some people 
in Istria did indeed support fascism, but they were in the 
minority, and that there was an overwhelming number of 
freedom-loving, democratically oriented people. 
  "Ignoring the fact that Istria and its civic, i.e. municipal 
councils want to introduce bilingualism in their region, 
President Tudjman displayed a complete lack of tolerance toward 
Istria and the wishes of its inhabitants," Jakovcic said, 
commenting on the president's speech in Istria. In Jakovcic's 
opinion, Mr. Tudjman used a national holiday to promote the 
political views of a party, which is quite improper. 
  Jakovcic also commented on the formation yesterday of a 
presidential Council for Istria on the island of Brijuni and 
said that this was, for a change, a new, somewhat more subtle 
attempt to push through the HDZ vision of Istria and the HDZ 
program. Jakovcic added that this attempt was indeed based on 
the Constitution, but shows that the president is aware that the 
HDZ is not able to win the trust of Istria with its program and 
political views. Jakovcic considers the founding of the 
presidential Council for Istria hypocritical, while Emil 
Soldatic, IDS secretary, said that the masks have fallen, and 
the Council advocates the HDZ Motovun program. Soldatic also 
claims that it is now obvious that the "Dom" Society in Pazin is 
nothing but a branch office, or transmission of the HDZ. 
Furthermore, he wondered whether the HDZ and "Dom" are offering 
Istria a civic society like Glavas's fief in Osijek, a town with 
a similar destiny to Split's. 
  Jakovcic said that not a single member of the IDS, HSLS 
[Croatian Social Liberal Party], SDP [Party of Democratic 
Changes], and HSNZ [Croatian Party of Natural Law], was invited 
to lunch with the president at Bijela Vila [White Villa] on 
Brijuni, and that this gesture proved that the people in Istria 
who voted at the latest elections were being ignored. The IDS 
supports principled views of Istrian mayors and representatives 
of the County of Istria who spurned the invitation. 
  Emil Soldatic said that the fact that former IDS member Ivan 
Herak was present when the Council was formed, showed that Herak 
"had come where he belonged," and that this move of Herak's is 
interesting, since HSLS President Drazen Budisa told him Herak 
would not go to Brijuni. "If that decision was made by the HSLS 
after all, then one can say the party is the HDZ in sheep's 
clothing and that the HDZ program is beginning to be realized in 
Istria," said Soldatic. 
  Denis Jelenkovic, IDS member appointed to the Council for 
Istria, was not on Brijuni, and Jakovcic repeated that the 
County Assembly decided it would not send their members to the 
Council, and if someone were to go against this decision, the 
party would not ignore it. Jakovcic said that he was aware 
Jelenkovic was trying to benefit Istria, but that it should not 
be done through para-state institutions. 
  Asked to comment on the presence of the defense minister and 
police at the constituent assembly of the Council for Istria, 
Jakovcic replied that this could be explained by the view of 
some HDZ members who hold that the problem of Istria can also be 
solved with the army and police. 
  The IDS president also commented on the latest developments 
in the Croatian Parliament and the negotiations between the 
opposition and the ruling party, and concluded that the HDZ had 
accepted a new proposition of the opposition, but that it was 
obvious that the negotiating team of the ruling party was not 
capable of implementing it as it had been agreed.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Drazen Vukov-Colic: "Ever Narrower Circles"] </F>
  [Text] [Italian Foreign Minister] Antonio Martino and 
[Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi could in principle be 
satisfied with what they managed to get in Corfu. At this 
meeting of the heads of the European Union, on which occasion a 
new European flag bearing 16 stars was first raised (Norway, 
Finland, Sweden, and Austria have signed admission agreements), 
Rome has after all made a few steps that will make Italy, at 
least in the foreseeable future, more important in this newly 
enlarged society than it was during its relentless "political 
purgatory" within the circle of the former Twelve. The meeting 
of "the Magnificent Seven" (the most developed industrial 
countries in the world) will soon be held in Naples, at which 
Russia will be completely swamped by the economic and political 
embrace of the West, and Italy at the moment also chairs the 
CSCE. Berlusconi will thus not find only his own television 
stations crucial this time, as he will be all over the 
television screens as a leading global diplomat. In Corfu he 
even managed unexpectedly to tip the scales of the diplomatic 
trade over the election of the new president of the European 
Commission, in which even the Germans -- who only recently took 
it rather coldly -- had to give in to the European parliamentary 
games over Berlusconi's neofascist allies. Now PANORAMA claims 
that the Twelve have agreed to support Italy with its constant 
designs on Slovenia, and Italy has again been discovering what 
already seemed irretrievably lost: the mentality of the winner, 
though the most important players are being kicked out of 
diplomacy (Fini) and the soccer field (Pagliuca). 
  In this political and media atmosphere Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino is visiting Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Belgrade this 
Monday and Tuesday [27-28 June]. Rome has suffered quite a lot, 
being pushed out of the global remodeling of Bosnia-Herzegovina 
with contemptuous dismissal, with even Turkish soldiers accepted 
as part of the blue helmets, while Clinton expressly forbade the 
Italians to do the same. In the Balkans the Italians have 
suffered an unexpectedly large number of victims (European 
observers and journalists), but have received hardly any profit 
through sales; they are now among the loudest in the 
preparations for the reconstruction of Sarajevo, and some claim 
that the final plan for the division and rearrangement of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina will be sealed at the Naples meeting of the 
wealthiest nations. Martino arrives in Belgrade as the number 
one CSCE man, who might persuade Milosevic to let European 
observers go to Kosovo after all, while he comes to Zagreb as a 
neighbor, who will continue to drive Croatia crazy with the 
"hot-cold" policy whenever he deems it necessary. In parliament 
he thus rejected any stories about Italian territorial 
aspirations toward Slovenia and Croatia, promising -- as Granic 
described to a half-empty parliament -- "to abide by the 
European norms and agreements," but it is precisely those 
"European norms" that could bring more long-term headaches to 
Zagreb than the frivolous flirting of certain Italian circles 
with [Krajina's] Borislav Mikelic, the expert on all sorts of 
salami. Within a strictly diplomatic framework, Rome cannot 
harm Croatia, which only aspires to the Council of Europe, as 
much as Slovenia, which already hopes that it has squeezed its 
foot in the door of the European Union, but Rome can keep lead 
both countries by their noses to the applause of the European 
lobbies with constant references to the protection of minorities 
and free movement of capital, people, and ideas. 
  Those who support a similar observance of European standards 
in Istria constantly challenge Zagreb, while Zagreb can not 
silence Istria without alienating Europe, so Croatian diplomacy 
in that respect keeps chasing its own tail in ever narrower 
circles. Among other things, the Statute of the County of 
Istria has just been officially rejected because of some 
unwelcome multicultural and multilingual ideas, and at this 
moment only political dreamers could visualize that in the 
foreseeable future they could muster a majority in the Croatian 
parliament to agree to a new natural return of Italian property, 
and even vote for a law that would enable Italians -- or any 
foreigners -- to buy Croatian real estate. Croatian politics 
still adores Europe in principle, but only in the way that it 
does not become pregnant [as published], and to what extent this 
titillation from the other side of the Adriatic can be 
unpleasant was best shown by two heated speeches by Tudjman, in 
Podgora and Pazin, which, in some Italian circles, have caused 
surprise, shock, mockery, and rejection with barely concealed 
abhorrence. Anger and bitterness about "Cypriotization" and 
UNPROFOR are growing in Croatia, while Italy is enjoying a 
summer renaissance, so Mate Granic will, in his talks with 
Antonio Martino, have to invest a lot of good will, patience, 
and generosity to persuade his guest that it does not always pay 
to be pig-headed about everything because of a little political 
noise on either side of the Adriatic.

  [Text] Delegations from the Croatian and Turkish Defense 
Ministries have held talks in Zagreb on promoting bilateral 
cooperation. Croatian Deputy Defense Minister Josip Juras 
received the Turkish Defense Ministry delegation. 
  The Turkish delegation, led by Colonel General Teoman Ekran, 
held talks with Brigadier General Janko Bobetko, the chief of 
the General Staff of the Croatian Army; and Brig. Gen. Antun 
Tus, the main military adviser to the Croatian president. 
  After the talks Josip Juras said that the two delegations 
had 
discussed military and technical cooperation and aid, as well as 
cooperation at experts' level. He added that some very concrete 
agreements had been reached, and he believed they would 
materialize in the near future, in the interest of both 
countries. 
  The aim of our visit is to strengthen relations between 
Croatia and Turkey and discuss possibilities for cooperation 
between the two ministries, Ekran said.

<F P=106> [Article by S. Markovski: "Sentences From Five to Eight </F>
Years"] 
  [Text] More than seven and a half months since the 
beginning of the court trial in the so-called "Albanian 
paramilitary army," in the big hall of Skopje District Court, a 
council of three presided over by Ljubomir Jovevski, a judge in 
Skopje Communal Court II, stated its verdict yesterday. The 10 
defendants were given prison sentences of a total of 65 years. 
Judging by the first reactions, all the defendants except the 
seventh, Burim Murtezani, received their verdicts calmly, 
without any emotion. However, their lawyers expressed 
dissatisfaction with the harsh punishment and they said they 
would appeal against the first decision. The families of the 
defendants expressed even greater dissatisfaction because they 
obviously had expected them to be released. Only the deputy of 
the district attorney Stevan Pavlovski showed neither 
satisfaction or dissatisfaction. He said he would express his 
satisfaction or discontent depending on the written explanation, 
that is, after the lawyers and defendants have lodged their 
appeal. 
  After the verdict was read, and was also amplified by an 
explanation, taking into account the defendants' statements in 
the investigation and the main court proceedings, evaluating the 
verbal evidence (statements of witnesses, mainly of the defense) 
and comparing this to the material evidence, we can conclude 
that the court council fully accepted the accusation. In other 
words, it was concluded to be true that in October and November 
of 1991, by mutual consent, Mithat Emini, Hasan Agusi, Resmi 
Ejupi, Selam Elmazi, and Redjep Sinazi created a hostile 
association under the name of "National Defense Headquarters," 
and that until November 1993 they engaged in a number of hostile 
activities with the aim of a violent change of the 
Constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. The Court concluded as true 
the undoubted association, the provision of currency and arms 
from abroad, the assembling of a computer center, the formation 
of a Headquarters led by Mithat Emini together with others who 
were responsible for various military, strategic, and political 
functions, the formation of paramilitary units for the whole of 
western Macedonia, as well as for Skopje and Kumanovo, the 
preparation of an analysis on the political and security 
situation in the state, as well as on the activity and power of 
the enemy (The Macedonian Army, the Interior Ministry, and all 
the non-Muslim population), the formation of a messenger 
service, all as a function of the so-called "Ilirida" republic, 
as well as the issuing of a slogan according to which Albanians 
could speak to Slavs only via arms. 
  Having evaluated the whole event, the Court found all 10 
defendants guilty and passed the following sentences: Mithat 
Emini (49) from Tetovo was given eight years imprisonment. The 
same sentence was given to Hasan Agusi (34) from Gorni Lipljan, 
Kosovo, present Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Resmi Ejupi 
(46) from Gostivar, also citizen of the United States, Selam 
Elmazi (46) from Gostivar, and Redjepi Sinazi (40) from Tetovo 
were sentenced to seven years imprisonment. Husein Haskaj (43) 
from Djakovica, former Macedonian deputy defense minister, 
living in Skopje, Akif Demiri (53) from Cegrane, Gostivar 
district, and Abdiselam Arslani (48) from Poroj, Tetovo 
district, were sentenced to six years. Burim Murtezani (30) 
from Tetovo and Eugen Cami (53) from Debar were sentenced to 
five years in prison. The time they spent in prison during the 
investigation will also be taken into account. 
  The court also issued protective measures. Thus, Hasan Agusi 
will be expelled from Macedonia for good after he has served his 
sentence. All objects were confiscated by the state (guns, 
computers, vehicles, and so on). 
  Savo Kocarov, the defense lawyer of Mithat Emini announced 
that he would appeal and asked why a court proceeding was 
necessary when the Court reached its verdict on the grounds of 
an investigation that was mainly denied by the defendants at the 
main trial. The defense lawyer of Husein Haskaj, Burim 
Murtezani, and Eugen Cami also announced their intention to 
appeal, saying that the Court had not accepted any arguments 
presented by the defendants and the defense. 
  Contrary to this, the explanation of the verdict specified 
that all extenuating circumstances had been taken into account 
(the defendants had no previous convictions, they had no 
significant possessions, and some of them are in bad health).

<F P=106> [Report by Edo Zitnik from Strasbourg -- recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Zitnik] President Kucan warned the Parliamentary 
Assembly [of the Council of Europe] that greater Europe's 
expectations following the fall of the Berlin wall have bumped 
against big problems which gave rise to fundamentalisms of all 
colors. 
  [Kucan] I am not worried by the revival of Bolshevism, at 
least not in the countries that I know. However, I am worried 
by the populist movements of all sorts, especially those that 
are trying to place the demanding tasks of resolving difficult 
issues that some nations are facing on others by constant 
xenophobic search for enemies and an atmosphere of perennial 
threats. 
  [Zitnik] The Balkans is a part of Europe and its divisions, 
too. For as long as there is no peace in the Balkans, according 
to Kucan, peace will be endangered everywhere on the old 
continent: 
  [Kucan] The Serbian national question is the nucleus of the 
Balkan crisis. It is as legitimate as all others, however, just 
as with the others its resolution demands and permits only the 
use of legitimate means and ways. A solution imposed by war 
cannot be legitimate and thus not acceptable. Lasting peace 
cannot be won by wars. 
  [Zitnik] President Kucan could not circumvent the Italian- 
Slovene dispute, with which the Concil of Europe is well 
acquainted even though, just like Brussels, it refuses to speak 
out openly about it. 
  [Kucan] Slovenia would perceive the closing of the EU doors 
as a new historic injustice. Because of some decisions that 
have been made over the last few months such sentiments of ours 
are justified. I do not believe that any country would like to 
prove its strength and influence within the EU by obstructing 
Slovenia's membership and making it conditional to its selfish 
interests. 
  [Zitnik] President Kucan finally emphasized that Slovenia 
expects special understanding for its position which is as 
unique as the position of any other European country.

  [Text] Ljubljana, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Slovene Justice 
Minister Miha Kozinc resigned over his role in a scandal which 
involved exploiting legal loopholes to give extremely favourable 
housing credits to state officials. 
  Kozinc, who chaired the government's housing commission, 
resigned under pressure from the public indignant that officials 
in newly-independent Slovenia should have greater privileges 
than those enjoyed by functionaries in the defunct communist 
regime. 
  The commission was paying out up to 100,000 Deutsche marks' 
worth of housing credits from the state budget at interest rates 
one-sixth of those paid by the man in the street for a housing 
credit from a commercial bank. 
  The favourable credits were used for a variety of purposes 
other than housing, such as building a swimming pool in the 
pation in the case of rightist M.P. Irena Oman. Kozinc himself 
benefited from the scheme to the tune of 70,000 Deutsche marks 
in housing credits. 
  Kozinc is the fifth minister to resign from the cabinet of 
Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek in recent months, which means that 
one-third of the ministers have been replaced under a cloud.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- The international 
community should recognize both state entities in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Moslem-Croat 
federation and the Bosnian Serb republic -- if the conflicts 
there are to be settled, Bosnian Serb Foreign Minister Aleksa 
Buha said to Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino Tuesday. 
Martino arrived in Belgrade earlier in the day for a brief 
working visit. 
  After the meeting, Buha told a press conference that he had 
conveyed to Martino the Bosnian Serb stand that it was necessary 
to accept that Bosnia's three sovereign peoples were entitled to 
freely decide about their future. 
  It was made clear to Martino that the international 
community 
had to admit at last that an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina is 
no more than a fiction, Buha said. 
  The Serb side said to the Italian delegation that the 
international community had got entangled in a net from which it 
can hardly free itself without new ideas, said Buha. 
  The Italian delegation's insisting on getting first-hand 
information on the Bosnian Serb views of the solution to the 
Bosnian conflict is interpreted by Bosnian Serb officials as 
showing Rome's obvious intention to play a more active role in 
the Bosnian peace process. 
  Assessing the results of his talks with Martino and his 
aides, Buha said that the first impression was that they were 
people prepared to work without prejudice. 
  Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plavsic, who also 
attended the talks, said after the meeting that the talks with 
the Italian foreign minister had come at the right time. She 
apparently had in mind some important forthcoming meetings, 
including the summit of the Group of Seven most industrialized 
nations and Russia on July 8 to 10. There are indications that 
the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be decided at this meeting.

  [Text] Skopje, 29 June (TANJUG) -- At a news conference in 
Skopje, the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] in Macedonia [The 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], headed by 
Avdija Pepic, has distributed copies of a letter sent by the 
Foreign Ministry of the Muslim government in Sarajevo to the 
Macedonian parliament. The letter insists that a new category 
be introduced in the Macedonian population census 
questionnaires: "Nationality -- Bosniak." 
  In an explanation, the Bosnian Foreign Ministry says that 
this is in accordance with Article 7 of the Muslim 
constitutional law, and insists on a representative of the 
Sarajevo Muslim government -- the Bosniak-Croat Federation -- 
taking part in the census. 
  In the period preceding the census, the SDA itself demanded 
the introduction of Bosniaks as a new name for the Muslims of 
Macedonia, in accordance with a decision by a symposium held in 
the Muslim part of Sarajevo this spring. 
  According to observers in Skopje, this demand, if fulfilled, 
would cause a lot of confusion among the Islamic population in 
Macedonia. This is because, in addition to a certain number of 
Muslims of Bosnian origin, there is also in Macedonia a certain 
number of Serb-speaking Muslims who came from Serbia, 
Montenegro, and Herzegovina, as well as about 100,000 
Macedonian-speaking Muslims. According to Macedonian analysts, 
the introduction of the term Bosniak for all Muslims in the 
territory of former Yugoslavia represents yet another 
fundamentalist invention of Alija Izetbegovic and his Islamist 
aides working on the homogenization of the entire Muslim 
population in the territory of former Yugoslavia.

  [Text] The cooperation of Abdic's renegades and their 
friends, the chetniks, which they neither want to nor can 
conceal, has revealed all its futility with the closure of a 
corridor for the delivery of humanitarian aid to the free 
territories of the Bihac district. In an attempt to rescue and 
preserve his dictatorship, which is diminishing daily while its 
residents have realized the full extent of [words indistinct] of 
a sick mind, he is in this way trying to force the residents of 
the district to surrender and renounce their own Islamic 
identity and their Bosnia-Herzegovina through surrender, a 
proclamation by the regional committee of the Party of 
Democratic Action [SDA] Bihac says, among other things. 
  In the name of the citizens and the SDA members, we demand 
that the international institutions and the United Nations carry 
out their fundamental task within their mandate, which is [words 
indistinct] to secure the unhindered delivery of humanitarian 
aid to the free part of the Bihac district. From the 
Presidency, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government, and the Foreign 
Ministry, we demand energetic action to [words indistinct] 
demand that the relevant international factors deliver 
humanitarian aid [words indistinct] way. 
  This manner excludes any risk or manipulation by [words

the UN forces. In the name of the residents of the Bihac 
district and the SDA members, we call and appeal to all those of 
Fikret's [word indistinct] who have been mislead and forcefully 
mobilized to cross to the side of their people and their country 
and feel the breeze of victory blowing from the peaks of Mount 
Ozren, where the (?terrorists) are fleeing heedlessly, to defend 
and liberate what is ours [words indistinct] enjoy the beauty of 
our free and [word indistinct] Bosnia from the liberated peaks 
of Grmec, Kozara, Jahorina, and Vlasic, is stated in the 
proclamation by the regional committees of the SDA in Bihac.

<F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>
  [Excerpt] In Velika Kladusa, Fikret Abdic's paramilitary 
continues terrorizing people and carrying out mass arrests. The 
latest news says: Three imams and some 10 hajjis have been 
arrested or taken to camps. Currently, altogether there are 
approximately 1,700 opponents to the forcefully proclaimed 
autonomy who are being held in Abdic's prisons and camps. There 
are even children as young as seven in the camps. We learned 
this in Zagreb today from a former prisoner who was detained in 
the (?Drnovi) camp. 
  Abdic's supporters are also arresting the deputies of the 
Bosnia- Herzegovina Assembly from the Bihac district and the 
members of their families. Deputy Hazim Muric and his father 
are imprisoned, and so is Ejup Alagic, president of the Velika 
Kladusa communal assembly, and his entire family -- a wife and 
two children. A father and a sister of Murija (?Mirkovic), 
deputy in the Chamber of Citizens of the Bosnia-Herzegovina 
Assembly, have also been detained. Deputy (?Ivkovic) has 
confirmed this himself. There is a reign of terror and mass 
arrests in Kladusa. The people are being imprisoned in one of 
the following four camps -- Drmeljevo, (?Bavionica), [word 
indistinct], and (?Vrnograd). [passage omitted]

  [Text] Bileca, June 28 (TANJUG) -- If the international 
community wants peace, it will have to respect the Serbs' just 
victory because they have remained on their territories, Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said Tuesday. The Bosnian Serbs 
now control 70 percent of the territory of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina while according to land 
registration documents they owned 64 percent of the republican 
territory before the war. 
  Under the international plan, the Bosnian Serb Republic is 
to 
get 49 percent of the Bosnian territory and the Moslem-Croat 
Federation 51 percent. 
  If the international community does not want peace, it will 
again, like on earlier occasions, offer unacceptable maps and 
humiliating conditions to the Serb victorious army, knowing that 
the Serbs will reject such a plan, Karadzic said at a ceremony 
in a Bileca army barracks marking the day of the Bosnian Serb 
army. 
  "If the maps are in any way acceptable, we will have them 
for 
the love of our brothers in Serbia and Montenegro, but only 
under the condition that the sanctions be lifted, which will 
have to be included in the peace document," Karadzic said in the 
eastern Herzegovina town Bileca. 
  In May 1992, the United Nations imposed tough economic and 
political sanctions on Yugoslavia because of alleged involvement 
in the civil war in the territory of the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  If the international "Contact Group" for Bosnia comes with 
unacceptable maps, Serbia and Montenegro will not insist that we 
accept them, Karadzic said and added that, like in earlier 
occasions, they would stand firmly by the Bosnian Serbs. 
  The general staff commander of the Bosnian Serb army, 
Colonel-General Ratko Mladic said the Serbs "want peace with all 
their hearts but not any peace and not at any cost." 
  The Serbs want "honourable and digified peace respecting the 
results of our struggles over the centuries and in this latest 
war, our victories and our past and present rights."

  [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Moslems have been 
fiercely attacking from mortars and all arms all along the Bihac 
front in northwestern Bosnia since morning, Bosnian Serb army 
sources said on Tuesday. 
  The local Serb army command reported Moslem troop movements 
along most lines of separation, which is another proof that 
forces loyal to Moslem hardliner Alija Izetbegovic do not care 
for a ceasefire. 
  In the northeast, Moslem troops are keeping up a continuous 
stream of attacks on the serb positions near Doboj and on Mt 
Ozren in violation of the latest truce, which came into effect 
on June 10. 
  Moslem commander Rasim Delic said last week that his troops 
were waging an offensive war, prompting Bosnian Serb President 
Radovan Karadzic to warn on Saturday that the Serbs would launch 
a counter-offensive if the Moslem attacks continued. 
  "I am alarmed that this upsurge in fighting threatens the 
prospects for reaching a comprehensive cessation of hostilities 
and undermines efforts already under way to broker an overall 
political settlement," U.N. Special Envoy to Former Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi said in Sarajevo before leaving for a meeting at 
NATO headquarters in Brussels. 
  U.N. commander for Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Sir Michael 
Rose, said before leaving for Brussels on Tuesday that the 
Moslem side "is the one that has been most hostile to the peace 
process and constantly breaching the ceasefire." 
  "The danger is that they will provoke a massive Serb 
response," Rose added. 
  Akashi and Rose will discuss with NATO leaders possibilities 
for coordinated U.N. and NATO action in case of both acceptance 
and refusal of an international peace offer by the Bosnian 
belligerents, Reuters said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 June (TANJUG) -- Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino, on a short working visit to the 
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, met with Serb Republic 
Vice-President Biljana Plavsic and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha 
in Belgrade today. 
  After the meeting Biljana Plavsic told reporters that the 
talks with the Italian foreign minister came at the right 
moment, clearly having in mind the forthcoming meetings, 
including the G7 summit, at which, as expected, the fate of 
former Bosnia-Herzegovina could be finally decided. 
  Assessing today's talks with Martino and his aides, Buha 
said 
that his first impression was that they were "beginning to do 
the job with a fresh approach and without bias." 
  The Italians wanted to hear at first hand where the Serb 
Republic sees the solution of the Bosnian conflict, which was 
interpreted in Serb Republic circles as an obvious intention by 
Rome to get more actively involved in the Bosnian peace process. 
  According to Buha, the Italian minister and his aides were 
today informed about the general position of the Serb Republic 
on the Bosnian conflict. First of all, the Italians were told, 
the international community has gotten itself entangled in a net 
from which it ccan hardly get out unless it could come up with 
some new ideas. 
  There are two main conditions for the resolution of the 
conflict, as far as the Serb Republic is concerned, Buha said. 
The first one is that the international community acknowledges 
at long last that the former Bosnia-Herzegovina cannot exist as 
an independent state any more, that this is a piece of fiction. 
  The other condition is that things in the former Bosnia- 
Herzegovina are called by their real names. This means that 
there are three sovereign nations in the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina who can decide their own fate. The 
international community should recognize two state entities - 
the Muslim-Croat federation and the Serb Republic, Buha said.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- After meeting with 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today, Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino said that the talks were interesting 
and fruitful. 
  Martino reiterated that his mission was to find a peaceful 
solution to the Yugoslav crisis before the forthcoming G7 
meeting G7 in Naples. 
  The Italian Foreign Minister said that he is still a 
"stubborn" optimist regarding the future, adding that he agreed 
with President Milosovic that peace is the most important thing 
for the prosperity of the region, the surrounding states, and 
the whole of Europe. 
  Martino stressed that the next two weeks will be crucial for 
finding a solution to the crisis. Expressing his hope that, 
with peace as the main goal, something constructive would happen 
in the period between now and the G7 meeting in Naples on 8 
July, Martino said that he does not have "a magic formula in his 
pocket" but that the encouraging signs on the horizon should not 
be discarded. 
  Asked about Serbia's future role, Martino said that Serbia, 
President Milosevic and Yugoslavia have a very important role to 
play in the efforts successfully to implement the peace process. 
  Certain obstacles to peace must be overcome as they belong 
to 
the past and are not a problem of the future, the minister said. 
"If we have a constructive approach to the problem, things will 
work out fine", he added. 
  Martino said he discussed the sanctions against the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia with Milosevic and that he said that all 
sides could benefit from trade, which is a unifying factor in 
international relations and of great importance for all 
countries. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic, who also took 
part in the talks, agreed with Martino's description of the 
talks as cordial and meaningful and that they showed that both 
sides are interested in establishing peace promptly and in 
removing all artificial obstacles to achieving this. 
  "We are particularly encouraged by the fact that the new 
Italian government will intensify its activities in the peace 
process, as well as by the abandonment of the double-standards 
policy and the adoption of a principled stance to the Yugoslav 
crisis, since this is the only stance that can bring peace," 
Jovanovic said. 
  The parts of the talks relating to world politics showed 
adherence to the principles of peace and a significant degree of 
readiness by both sides to contribute towards finding positive 
solutions to all different aspects. We believe that we shall 
continue to develop principled cooperation with Italy, as the 
most important neighboring state, Jovanovic said.

<F P=106> ["Foreign Ministry Statement on Italian Foreign Minister's </F>
Visit" -- TANJUG headline] 
  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- Antonio Martino, 
foreign minister of the Republic of Italy, paid a one-day visit 
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] on 28 June. The 
talks with Federal Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic centered 
on the international community's intensive efforts aimed at 
finding a peaceful solution to the Yugoslav crisis, the two 
countries' contribution in this respect, and certain bilateral 
issues. 
  The Yugoslav side informed its Italian collocutors about the 
constructive efforts the FRY is making toward ending the civil 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible by reaching a 
peace agreement, with respect for the legitimate interests of 
the parties involved. 
  Voicing support for the new Italian Government's endeavors 
to 
become more actively involved in the peaceful resolution of the 
Yugoslav crisis, the Yugoslav side expressed its hope that Italy 
-- a neighboring country and influential member of the European 
Union -- will contribute to a principled approach to the crisis. 
As Italy will soon be presiding over the summit of the G-7 and 
Russia in Naples, hope was expressed that Italy will contribute 
to the shaping of a more objective view of a resolution and a 
more realistic position regarding the search for a just and 
lasting peace. 
  Special emphasis was laid in the talks on the need for 
normalizing relations between the FRY and the CSCE, with the 
lifting of the ban on the FRY's activities as the final result. 
  The Yugoslav side underscored the necessity for lifting the 
sanctions, since it has met all the conditions stemming from 
relevant UN Security Council resolutions. There is a growing 
awareness among international factors that the FRY is actively 
engaged in the search for a peaceful solution, while the 
sanctions are becoming counterproductive because they are 
encouraging the advocates of the war option and rendering peace 
talks more difficult. In addition to their dire consequences 
for the population and the economy of the FRY, the sanctions are 
adversely affecting neighboring countries and the entire 
European continent. As a result of the sanctions, 
Yugoslav-Italian trade has dropped from several billion dollars 
to zero. 
  The Italian side was informed about the situation in the 
Balkan region, relations with neighboring countries, and the 
current process of normalizing relations with the former 
Yugoslav republics -- something Yugoslavia is sincerely 
interested in. 
  The meeting reaffirmed the traditionally friendly relations 
between Yugoslavia and Italy -- relations that are not burdened 
by open problems. It was mutually concluded that significant 
prospects exist for the revival of all-encompassing bilateral 
cooperation after the sanctions are lifted. The conviction was 
expressed that the development of such cooperation will in 
future be an important impetus to the overall normalization of 
economic and political ties in the region of former Yugoslavia.

<F P=106> [Report by Jelena Radovanov on statements by Italian Foreign </F>
Minister Antonio Martino and FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav 
Jovanovic in Belgrade on 28 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Martino, in English fading into Radovanov report in 
Serbo-Croatian] The talks with President Milosevic were 
extremely interesting and fruitful, Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino said. These are the final talks with all the 
sides that are involved in the Bosnia-Herzegovina war in order 
to find ways for progress and peace, and to prepare for the 
meeting of the G-7 and Russia in two weeks time in Naples, 
Minister Martino said. The talks with President Milosevic were 
cordial and very instructive. I am an optimist when it comes to 
the future. I think that we should overcome the disorder of the 
present and the historical roots of the conflict, and turn to 
the future and its promises. I think, Minister Martino said, 
that peace is essential for the prosperity of this region and 
these countries, as well as for the entire Europe. I was happy 
to hear what President Milosevic had to say and to draw 
conclusions from his views, Minister Martino said. 
  This is how FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] Foreign 
Minister Jovanovic assessed the talks between Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic and Italian Foreign Minister Martino: 
  [Jovanovic] I will go along with what the minister said 
about the talks being cordial and substantive, and that they 
showed that both sides are very interested in reaching peace as 
soon as possible, and in the removal of all the artificial 
obstacles that thwart the efforts for reaching peace even before 
the latest efforts. [sentence as heard] We are particularly 
encouraged by the fact that the new Italian Government is going 
to intensify its activities in the process, and do everything it 
can to mark the departure from the policy of double standards so 
that a principled approach is formed toward the Yugoslav crisis. 
A principled approach is the only one that can lead to peace. 
The talks about all the aspects of the Yugoslav crisis show the 
common concern for peace, and the readiness of both sides to 
contribute to a positive solution for Bosnia [words indistinct]. 
  We believe that -- together with Italy as the most important 
neighboring country -- we will find ways for developing a 
constructive cooperation and continuing political contacts.

<F P=106> [Article by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>
  [Text] New York, June 25 (TANJUG) -- Ousted from Bosnia by 
the ruling of the 1878 Berlin Congress after centuries of 
occupation, Turkey is now being sent back by the U.N. 
secretary-general. The former occupier is returning 116 years 
later under the guise of a "peacekeeper." Apparently aware of 
the paradox, Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has long 
opposed the idea of including Turkey in the U.N. Protection 
Force (UNPROFOR) in the breakaway Yugoslav republic of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, seeing this as being sharply at odds with 
the proclaimed principle that neighbouring countries and former 
occupiers could not serve as peacekeepers in the Balkan crisis. 
  Eventually, because of a poor response from the other 
nations 
to an appeal to donate troops to UNPROFOR, the principle has 
gone the way of many another and was trampled underfoot by 
Butrus-Ghali's "yes" to the Turks. However, Turkey's historical 
occupation of Bosnia and return, this time under the wing of the 
United Nations, is not the only paradox which has made the 
peacekeeping force a mockery. 
  Turkey has a notoriously smudged record in international 
relations, which the West is inclined to turn a blind eye to 
because of the country's strategic importance to NATO. One has 
only to remember Turkey's presence in Cyprus, where its forces 
have held one-half of the island under occupation for twenty 
years. One might think that Turkey has spent the past twenty 
years under sanctions for the occupation. Not so. Turks remain 
in Cyprus, the United Nations wastes billions of dollars on 
maintaining a peacekeeping force there, but there is no mention 
of sanctions from any quarter. 
  Sanctions seem to be reserved for the likes of Serbs, 
Haitians, Iraqis and, possibly, North Koreans. Nobody is even 
trying to answer the question whether a country can be an 
occupier of a neighbour and still serve as a peacekeeper in 
another country, which it held under subjugation for centuries, 
at that. 
  U.N. press spokesmen have recently been stunned by the 
provocative question whether Serb peacekeeping troops might be 
sent to Cyprus. The question seemed absurd and provoked gales 
of mirth from the assembled reporters. Nobody laughed about the 
deployment of Turks in Bosnia- Herzegovina. And indeed, this is 
no laughing matter. 
  The Western media raised hue and cry in February when 300 
Russian troops were to be deployed in Sarajevo. However, the 
world is taking in its stride the deployment of 1,500 Turks, in 
addition to the Malaysians, Jordanians and Egyptians already in 
Bosnia and the announced arrival of Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. 
The hypocrisy of the international community knows no bounds. 
  Another important and unanswered question emerges, viz. can 
a 
country enforce law and order in another state, while being 
unable to keep its own house in order. Turkey is notorious for 
its violation of human rights, and ranks fifth in the world for 
the number of journalists in prison. The world has forgotten the 
first big genocide of the 20th century, which was perpetrated by 
Turks killing more than a million Armenians. Similarly, the 
Western media today have deliberately forgotten the genocide 
perpetrated by the Nazis against the Serbs in World War Two. 
  This, then, is the picture of the state which is returning 
to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a "peacekeeper." All this should be 
reason enough for the powers that be on the east river to take a 
closer look at the moral criteria to be applied to would-be 
peacekeepers. There is no sign, however, that anybody is likely 
to give the matter a thought. 
  According to the latest information, the 1,500 Turkish 
troops 
and experts will be deployed along the lines of separation 
between Moslems and Croats in the areas of Zenica and Kakanj in 
central Bosnia. But, can one really believe that this will be 
so, after so many principles have been trampled on. According to 
a statement submitted by the Turkish mission to the United 
Nations, the Turkish troops are bringing to Bosnia 393 vehicles, 
including 70 trucks and 33 armoured cars. The statement was 
withdrawn before it could be seen by most of the reporters, 
leaving behind a massive speculation about 200 vehicles which 
are mentioned en masse, but not separately described. 
  It is a generally recognised fact that Turkey has been 
smuggling arms to the Moslems in Bosnia. So now it would appear 
that it is helping their brothers in Allah with one hand, while 
tipping its blue helmet with the other. When to this is added 
the ease with which international institutions and the Western 
media are ignoring the latest Moslem offensive in Bosnia, it is 
not clear whether the world wants peace or war in Bosnia. Or is 
it.

<F P=106> [Article by V. Grlickov: "Money: Indication of Changes"] </F>
  [Text] Bank liquidity has deteriorated suddenly because the 
banks have half the funds (70 million dinars) in giro accounts 
than in their previous "fatter condition" because of the 
measures taken by the central bank. Since the greatest debate at 
present is about furnishing money for the purchase of 
agricultural products, the impression has been created that bank 
liquidity is dropping because of the outflow from accounts for 
those purposes. Now, this could be a partial explanation. The 
season for the principal purchases in agriculture (wheat) has 
not yet arrived, and the job of "covering" seasonal fruit and 
vegetables is coming to a close. (Union Bank had a share of 30 
percent in financing transactions that bring considerable export 
results.) Bank liquidity is dropping, above all as a consequence 
of money withdrawn from circulation because foreign exchange has 
been purchased with the reserves of the National Bank. The 
slowness with which that foreign exchange is effectuated 
(providing imports) is another question; this can mainly be 
attributed to the sanctions and less to speculative operations 
related to the outflow of capital abroad. 
  The fundamental commitment in the Avramovic program of 
supplying the money in circulation from real sources, that is, 
with coverage by foreign exchange, gold, and goods -- is not for 
the moment in jeopardy. But this policy of sound money, as 
Governor Dragoslav Avramovic said himself in the meeting with 
people from the Yugoslav-Swiss Bank, has its limits. First of 
all, we cannot assume that the state will be able to supply 
foreign exchange indefinitely to cover budget deficits, which 
include purchases from agriculture. That is why the governor is 
insisting that the budget deficit be eliminated entirely as of 
24 July, so that expenditures are covered entirely by taxes (a 
broader coverage of taxpayers at a somewhat lower tax rate). At 
the same time, the state could borrow on the capital market, but 
absolutely not from the National Bank in the form of credit 
supplied from primary issue. This ought to be done through the 
sale of government bonds, whose sales on the market should be 
sign to the central bank as to the extent that the budget 
deficits can be covered with real funds. 
  The tax system is the second vital area whose importance to 
the success of the program the governor is stressing. The most 
acute problem is the tying of taxes to wages and salaries, which 
is resulting in the phenomenon of "double payrolls": the one on 
which the taxes are charged and the other, which is paid in 
cash. It is the system that is driving the state to increase 
wages and salaries, since total tax collections depend on that. 
  It is still uncertain whether primary note issue will be 
used 
to cover wheat purchases, which, according to some calculations, 
will require 320 million dinars in July and August. The model 
proposed by the Federal Government precludes primary note issue; 
the banks would have to supply 80 percent and the purchasers 20 
percent. The banks would provide most of the funds from federal 
or republic deposits, and they would use the legal reserves to a 
lesser extent. Statements to the effect that there will not be 
any adverse monetary effects are based on the assumption that 
the federal state and the republics have deposits in the banks 
from real sources, while use of the legal reserves (the 
remaining 5 percent which the banks set aside against sight 
deposits) is not considered an inflationary source, or it is 
assumed that the effect on this basis will be canceled out in 
some way, say, by withdrawal of money from circulation through 
the purchase of foreign exchange. 
  One particular problem is that payments based on purchases 
in 
agriculture would follow a protracted schedule: 30 percent would 
be paid immediately, while 70 percent would go into savings 
accounts in time deposits for 30 or 60 days. It would have been 
better to use securities, commercial commodity bills or notes, 
as elements for speeding up financial markets. 
  The greatest doubts about realization of the Avramovic 
program center on the fact that the banks seem not to be able to 
count on repayment of outstanding credits (about 1,070 billion 
dinars as of end-May) as a source for making new loans. Governor 
Avramovic does not deny the existence of that problem, nor did 
he earlier, but he mentions that he himself does not know what 
the figures are on the extent of uncollectibility (money has 
gone, for instance, to pay wages and salaries), nor how much was 
loaned out for longer terms than allowed by sight deposits -- 
but for the first time he mentioned as a problem the 
inefficiency of the system, which arises in connection with the 
approval of loans and use of money from the banks. To be sure, 
he does not say this explicitly, but indirectly, giving as an 
example the deteriorated situation in the German economy 
following unification of the Western and Eastern parts. The 
question is whether the otherwise desirable increase of wages 
and salaries of those who are productively employed will be 
sufficient shock absorbers to offset the adverse consequences of 
possible social unrest. In any case, primary note issue must be 
precluded as a way out, since the limits within which it could 
be given real coverage are very narrow.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday praised the opposition New 
Democracy Party for supporting the idea of a national unity 
government by joining the cabinet of Premier Mirko Marjanovic. 
  Milosevic said that the party had acted from patriotic 
motives, rising above petty party interests. Milosevic was 
speaking with the party's representatives whom he received on 
the occasion of 100 days in office of the Serbian government. He 
had first received Prime Minister Marjanovic and his cabinet. 
  After the meeting, New Democracy president Dusan Mihajlovic 
told reporters the party had no reason to be dissatisfied with 
the decision to join the cabinet. Mihajlovic said the party had 
accepted the offer to join the Marjanovic cabinet because of the 
latter's promise to work actively for peace, the lifting of 
international sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro), 
its reintegration in the international economic and political 
community and the implementation of the country's economic 
recovery programme.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) - Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday gave the government positive marks 
for the first 100 days in office. 
  He said he was convinced that, with popular support, the 
cabinet of Serbian Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic stood a good 
chance of success in the implementation of the Yugoslav economic 
recovery programme. Serbia, together with Montenegro, forms 
Yugoslavia. 
  Milosevic received Marjanovic and his cabinet on the 
occasion 
of their 100 days in office. Milosevic said the government had 
been consistent in the application of the economic recovery 
programme, which was launched on January 24 and is being 
implemented at federal level. Milosevic described as 
achievements unrivalled in years the rise in industrial and 
agricultural production and elimination of the budget deficit 
recorded in the past three months. Marjanovic, for his part, 
said that industrial production had risen by 18.6 per cent from 
January to May 1994. The stocks of finished goods are melting 
down, which means that the output is not being stock-piled, but 
absorbed by the market, he added. 
  Milosevic said that another of the government's achievements 
was that it had broken away from the legacy of decades of 
bureaucratic rule and that the initial criticism that it was a 
cabinet of technocrats had turned out to be an advantage. 
  The fact that it comprises a large number of former industry 
executives has led to its breaking away from the bureaucratic 
legacy of evading responsibility and has contributed to its 
creative approach to dealing with problems, Milosevic said. 
  "I am sure that this kind of record after 100 days and this 
kind of experience with which the government has embarked on 
this crucial stage in the implementation of the economic 
programme give it a good chance of success," he added. 
  Marjanovic said that the economic recovery programme was not 
one intended to ensure merely the nation's survival, but also a 
promotion of the market mechanisms and life in dignity in 
conditions of international isolation. 
  Moreover, the programme lays the groundwork for an economic 
boom after sanctions, Marjanovic said and added that the 
government was giving results, that the programme had been 
widely accepted and the people would not agree to any solution 
that would take them back to the inflationary chaos of last 
January. 
  "It remains for us at all times to unrequivocally defend, 
protect and promote the healthy dinar as the pivot of our future 
economic prosperity," Marjanovic said.

<F P=106> [Report by N. Ilic: "Claws of the Turkish Beys"] </F>
  [Text] Over the last 10 years and especially since the 
disintegration of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia], southeast Serbia has lived in a tense and 
unpleasant shadow of the frantic Islamization of the neighboring 
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. This is an 
assessment that can be heard ever more frequently in this region 
and also in the reports of the leading international agencies. 
  In the last three years Turkey has been acting more and more 
aggressively toward Macedonia, taking advantage of its poor 
economic position and the blockade from the south. The aim is 
to conquer the territories in the south Balkans that the Ottoman 
Empire lost some 70 years ago, correspondents of REUTER and the 
French papers write from Skopje. 
  According to these papers, the finale of the Turkish plan is 
to build a railroad to Albania through Macedonia, which would 
close the "green" circle around Serbia and open the possibility 
of a military-transport route toward Kosovo, Raska, and 
Montenegro. 
  It is also rumored that businessmen from Ankara and Istanbul 
are offering $200 million in nonrepayable investments to the 
FYROM Government to see "the Islam Express" roaring down the 
Macedonian railroad tracks in six months' time. All this 
envisages Skopje's meek consent to the realization of this 
project because this former Yugoslav republic is, due to the big 
credits it took from Turkey during the time of gaining its 
independence, financially and politically incapable of resisting 
this demand. 
  The national parties in FYROM admit that the Turkish beys 
have with this bought the tacit approval of the Macedonian 
officials, whom they have grasped in their claws for a long 
time. They have even managed to secure a 24-hour Turkish 
language television program in the middle of Macedonia as well 
as renovation and revival of the Turkish schools in Western 
Macedonia, where the majority of children do not speak the 
language of sultans at all. 
  By 2005 the Muslim population is expected to form the 
majority population in Macedonia. There are more pupils of the 
Islamic denomination in the first grades of primary schools than 
of other denomination now, the statisticians and those well 
acquainted with the situation in FYROM claim. 
  Behind all this, naturally, lies a question: Will Turkey, 
with a demographic explosion of the Islamic population via our 
southern neighbor, try to recapture what it lost in the Balkan 
wars and will it, with the railroad, by the end of the year be 
knocking on the doors of southeast Serbia, too? 
  "It is realistic to expect something of the kind. For the 
Turks have never overcome their loss of the Balkans. They have 
left sizable traces here and we can thus expect first the 
attacks of their propaganda and then of the remaining state 
'machinery,' concretely in Toplica and the region around Vranje, 
Pirot, Leskovac, and Nis, where numerous geographical localities 
are still registered under their [Turkish] names," Prokuplje 
historian Bozidar Cevori says. 
  According to him, history knows of cases of rapprochement of 
the Turks, the Albanians, the Sandzaklians [the residents of 
Sandzak], and the Turkicized Montenegrins with the aim of 
Islamizing the southeast and other parts of Serbia. Here, the 
construction of the railroad through Macedonia could give fresh 
impetus to the realization of Allah's ideas. The pretensions of 
the Turkish beys and landowners should evidently not be taken 
lightly as [Bosnia- Herzegovina President] Alija Izetbegovic 
himself has announced that this is part of the long-term plan of 
the resettlement of approximately 4 million Muslims from Turkey 
in the homes of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers.

  [Text] The Democratic Party of Serbia [Depos] held a 
regular news conference today. Party President Vojislav 
Kostunica spoke about the work of the Serbian Government in the 
last three months and the peace negotiations on the former 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. Katarina Andric-Milosavljevic reports: 
  [Andric-Milosavljevic] The Democratic Party of Serbia holds 
the view that the public has been presented a distorted picture 
on the work of the Serbian Government in the past 100 days. The 
assessments presented by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
and Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic yesterday differ from those 
that had been heard in the Serbian Assembly in the past few 
months, Kostunica said. While the president and the prime 
minister spoke about very successful work of the Serbian 
Government, the Serbian Assembly often has long debates and 
often hears certain politicians' sharp criticisms regarding the 
lack of efficiency in the implementation of the Serbian 
Government's measures, Vojislav Kostunica said. 
  The Democratic Party of Serbia takes the view that offered 
solution for the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which 
the Muslims would get 51 and the Serbs 49 percent of the 
territory, conceals many shortcomings for the Serbs. This stems 
from the fact that before the war the Serbs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina owned over 60 percent of territory and were 
in an absolute majority, territorially and population wise. The 
new division, giving a slight advantage to the Muslim side, 
appears to be an attempt to make an entity whose advantage would 
be extended in the future to numerous institutions that will 
serve the Muslim and Croatian sides. 
  Despite this, the Serbs must insist on the continuation of 
the peace negotiations in order to obtain a more favorable 
solution, officials of the Democratic Party of Serbia say.

<F P=106> ["P.L."-initialed commentary: "TV Gunpowder"] </F>
  [Text] One does not change a winning team. This old, and 
well-tested formula from the days when the Serbs ranted (on TV) 
about being endangered in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina can 
again be heard on Radio Television Serbia at prime time under 
the disguise of "special" political programs. For example, on 
Tuesday [21 June] (also on Sunday, and particularly on Monday) a 
special program was broadcast by TV Belgrade: The guests, 
leaders of the Serbs in "the former, unrecognized Yugoslav 
republic of Macedonia" [The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
Macedonia -- FYROM] seemed to compete in explaining how they had 
been "denied their collective rights," while at the same time 
they admitted that they were given their "individual rights" 
(the right to work, the freedom of speech and expression, the 
freedom of movement), and that they had no problems there. 
  As in previous (already seen) cases, "decent Macedonians" 
phoned in to Television Belgrade to express their "support for 
the right of the Serbian people to decide on their own fate," 
and to reject simultaneously "the possibility of forming some 
sort of a Macedonian party in Serbia." 
  Of course, the entire program was dedicated to the same 
issues: The census in Macedonia is illegal because "no one wants 
to admit that there are 250,000 of us in Kiro Gligorov's state" 
(all data reveal that this figure is blown out of proportion at 
least several times); the census is illegal since "it is aimed 
against the Serbian national entity"; the census is illegal 
since it "neglects the rights of the Serbs who are defending 
their hearths," and so on. 
  Experience tells us that such TV programs have usually been 
followed by going to war for "the liberation of territories" or 
for "the defense" of the aforementioned "hearths." The examples 
of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are too fresh to be easily 
forgotten. 
  The only question is: Will TV Belgrade (led by Milorad 
Vucelic] take that one step that separates peace from war, or 
will it stop after the census is over, along the lines of "let 
bygones be bygones"? 
  In both cases, the smell of TV gunpowder is very much in 
evidence.

  [Text] Podgorica, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Montenegrin 
Foreign Affairs Ministry has announced that Miodrag Lekic met 
Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino in Belgrade today. 
  Lekic "voiced the opinion that the peace process in 
connection with the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict is entering its 
most delicate stage to date, and that its end will either mean 
qualitative improvement or a plunge into an even deeper crisis 
and uncertainty." According to the Montenegrin foreign minister, 
by accepting or rejecting the furure peace plan, the warring 
sides in Bosnia will definitely declare themselves either for 
peace or for the continuation of the war. 
  The Italian foreign minister was reported as having said in 
talks with Lekic that his country holds Montenegro's 
constructive contribution to the current peace process in high 
esteem and he expressed Italy's readiness to go on aiding 
Montenegro in alleviating its difficulties. Contacts between 
Italian and Montenegrin representatives so far have been 
assessed as positive, and it was concluded with pleasure that 
they have lately been registering an upward trend. 
  Hope was expressed that cooperation between Montenegro and 
Italy will be promoted after the sanctions are lifted.

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, </F>
admiral in the Reserves, by Andrzej Woyciechowski at the Radio 
Zet studio in Warsaw on the "Guest of Radio Zet" program--live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Woyciechowski] Foreign 
language skills among our troops will soon prove useful--that is 
to say, during joint maneuvers, among others, during the joint 
exercises between the Polish Army and NATO. Is it true that 
they will take place in September? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, I hope so. We are in the midst of 
working out the details of the exercises along with NATO 
officials. They will take place during the first 20 days or so 
of September. 
  [Woyciechowski] Can you say where they will take place, in 
what region of the country, or is that a military secret? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] No, it is not a military secret. By the 
way, we will make efforts for the public to know quite a lot 
about the nature of these exercises, about their participants, 
about events taking place there, but the final decision has not 
yet been made.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Who will come from NATO? Will 
they be just generals and officers, or ordinary soldiers as well? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] There will also be so-called fundamental 
subdivisions: platoons and companies. We still do not know how 
many countries will send troops, but we do intend to invite 
observers to these exercises, which means all of our neighbors 
must definitely be here, as well as volunteers from among those 
who have declared their willingness to participate in 
Partnership for Peace. We simply think that the process of 
building mutual trust is [hesitating] a very crucial thing at 
this stage, and we want to demonstrate our exercises for the 
sake of peace and demonstrate that we want to learn the 
standards and procedures that are in effect in NATO. We want to 
establish rapid-deployment forces for the sake of prevention and 
maintaining peace and... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But, General--I am sorry, I 
mean Admiral--could you speak a little more about the exercises? 
They will be the first landing operation--it is just a figure of 
speech--by NATO in Poland. So my question is: Will NATO troops 
be seen around? Will U.S. soldiers be running around fields in 
rural areas? Will we see tanks.... 
  [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] Well, not exactly. 
  [Woyciechowski] Or perhaps the military will be the only one 
to see anything like that? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] To make a long story short: This will be 
the first instance of an exercise within the Partnership for 
Peace because, by that time, we will have signed an individually 
negotiated partnership program. Still, this will not be our 
first experience of that type since, for a few years now, we 
have been conducting joint training sessions. This year, we 
will have the joint exercises. Not so long ago, our mountain 
riflemen returned from the French Alps with a great many 
memories of their time there. We have also trained British and 
Dutch soldiers here in Poland. We will also take part ourselves 
in very large-scale peacekeeping [preceding word in English] 
exercises in the Netherlands, but.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What is that? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Peacekeeping [preceding word in English] is 
about having forces for the maintenance of peace, about 
preparing [words indistinct] for peacekeeping operations. It is 
a very important element when you think about how unstable the 
world continues to be and how many dangers... [Kolodziejczyk 
pauses] I do not even mention Yugoslavia because everybody 
knows about that part of the world, and everybody laments that 
the peacekeeping operations there are not efficient enough. 
Now, one of the goals of these exercises [with NATO] is to 
search for ways of improving efficiency. Still, the thing is 
that the issue is not up to the Army but up to the appropriate 
provisions of international law. 
  [Woyciechowski] Let us talk for a moment about the 
Individual Partnership Program. You said the negotiations are 
about to end and the program will be finalized soon. Will it be 
made public in its entirety? Will all that be made public 
[words indistinct]? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I think that, if one were to publish the 
program in its entirety, it would be an extremely boring 
document because, apart from the political preamble, which, by 
the way, is very short indeed, it is slightly over one page 
long, and, in it, I can reveal some secret here by saying that 
some formulations were included there that are very beneficial 
to us; we have made very strong efforts for that, and they were 
indeed included in the preamble. Now, when it comes to the 
entire remainder of the program, it consists of a compilation of 
tables that implement a gradual harmonization in a step-by-step 
way, and they include very specific measures in many different 
areas, beginning with.... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Let us explain it to our 
listeners: The minister means the measures that aim at our 
integration into NATO. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Exactly. 
  [Woyciechowski] Are they very [word indistinct] and very 
military items? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Yes, exactly. You are exactly right. The 
items cover integration of communications systems, unification 
of procedures, which, after all, were different, tactical signs, 
maps, exercises with maps, computer exercises, the command 
language, and a whole range of great undertakings [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Woyciechowski] My understanding is that it is a very 
detailed time schedule that begins in the so-called Year or 
Month Zero, and when is the final date in the time schedule, 
Admiral? What is the final deadline? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The schedule will be of a gradual nature. 
Over the years, we will be giving up those undertakings we 
deem... 
  [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But can one see an end? In 
other words, to put it in different words [words indistinct]...? 
  [Kolodziejczyk, interrupting] No, one cannot see an end 
because, up to now, no criteria have been defined that have to 
be met by countries to be included in the NATO family. We are 
making intensive efforts for that sake, and I hope that, in the 
near future, such criteria will indeed be defined. At any rate, 
we will be making intensive efforts for that sake because, as 
has been said on many occasions, our strategic goal is to 
integrate into the European security system; we want to be an 
active participant in that system, and we will do everything 
possible for the road to be as short as possible. 
  [Woyciechowski] Do you mean the European security system or 
NATO? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] You know, NATO has become quite a misleading 
label. It brings to mind a bloc type of defense system, 
whereas, currently, NATO is not a defense bloc of any kind but 
is, instead, the basis for constructing a security system and 
has been undergoing transformations, while, to many people, the 
label is misleading while many others deliberately use it--I 
mean our neighbors to the East--by saying: Here comes NATO, an 
aggressive bloc, approaching our borders. 
  [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, what about our eastern 
neighbors? What does Russia's participation in Partnership for 
Peace imply? In other words, is it a good thing or a bad one 
for us? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] You know, generally speaking, it sends a 
good message that means that, at least formally speaking, the 
Russians have approved the Partnership for Peace initiative, but 
their goodwill will be measured with their level of 
participation and involvement in the building of a security 
system that, after all, will include Russia as well. [passage

<F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Piotr </F>
Kolodziejczyk by Marek Henzler and Marek Ostrowski; place and 
date not given: "We Can Afford To Have 10 `Hussars'"] 
  [Excerpts] [POLITYKA] Mr. Minister, there is an 
expression stating that there is always some army stationed 
somewhere. If it is not our own, it is a foreign one. What kind 
of an army should the Polish Army be, to avoid having foreign 
troops stationed in the country? After all, we border three 
powerful neighbors. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I think I should state first of all that we 
are past the Warsaw Pact stage, where we were ascribed the role 
of a second-order force. Compared with contemporary needs, the 
logistics department, supplies systems, engineering troops, and 
everything that was supposed to secure high maneuverability in 
the operational space up to and including the Pyrenees has been 
developed excessively in our Army. The situation changed when 
the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the Soviet Union collapsed. 
  Overnight, the countries of the former Warsaw Pact found 
themselves without any concept of their own security policies. 
Many options were debated, including three fundamental ones: 
One was neutrality; a second was what President Walesa called 
"Eastern NATO," meaning some alliances without the Soviet Union; 
and the third was a very clear pro-NATO one that, in the 
beginning, we did not know how to deal with because it 
envisioned that, all of a sudden, we are to leave one alliance 
in order to join another. 
  [POLITYKA] So what kind of an army should we really have? 
Who should it defend us against? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] It will be an army of a defensive nature, 
but, at the same time, it will be characterized by mobility and 
flexibility in terms of the command process, and it will have 
three fundamental types of armed forces: Land Forces, with 
their own command structure, which we did not have before in a 
formal sense. What has been known as military districts up to 
now, will, as time goes by, take over the role of military 
administration, and they will deal with preparing a defense 
system and with training regional troops. A second component of 
the Army will consist of the command structure of the Air Force, 
and, finally, the command structure of the Navy, which, 
generally speaking, will maintain the form it has had 
heretofore. At this stage, we have about 248,000 soldiers, even 
though, according to treaties, we are allowed to have as many as 
288,000, plus we are planning further reductions. These will be 
necessary because of our financial situation. We also share the 
view of the Germans, who are also cutting the size of their 
Army, that, in this day and age, the number of troops is not as 
important as the weapons these troops have at their disposal. 
This would reduce the expense of maintaining the troops--which 
currently reach as much as 65 percent of the National Defense 
Ministry's [MON] budget--and instead, allow us to spend more on 
modern and incredibly costly equipment. It is true that a 
contemporary aircraft is capable of replacing a few or even a 
dozen or so aircraft of the previous generation, but the price 
of such a new aircraft is shocking: Take for instance the 
French Mirage 2000, which costs about $60 million, or a 
modernized version of the U.S.-made F-15, which has a price tag 
of about $100 million. If we are thinking seriously about our 
membership in the Euro-Atlantic security structures, we cannot 
just boast about the level of training provided to the troops 
but must also catch up with NATO's technical standards. 
[passage omitted] 
  [POLITYKA] Do the Sejm and the government not understand the 
needs associated with the country's security? Or is it perhaps 
a game of interests that the Army is simply losing? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] In this situation of shortages in the 
budget, strong pressure groups and interest groups have emerged 
that have even lead to a breach of the Budget Act by ordering 
MON to purchase 300 billion zlotys' worth of Iryda aircraft. It 
is a dangerous precedent, and it is good that the president 
decided to file a lawsuit over Article 36 of the Budget Act with 
the Constitutional Tribunal. 
  [POLITYKA] So why do you not have your own lobbying group in 
parliament, Mr. Minister? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The answer is simple. As a man who was 
designated by the president to serve in the prime minister's 
Cabinet, I am not loved by the coalition, whereas, when it comes 
to the opposition, they do not apply such distinctions, and, by 
acting against the interests of the coalition, they also act 
against me. 
  [POLITYKA] Would you receive better treatment in the 
process of budget designing if MON were not a presidential 
ministry? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] It is not all that bad with my cooperation 
with parliament. There are reasonable people there who, even if 
they do not know much about Army issues and are guided by 
logical thinking only, have a favorable opinion about us. On 
the other hand, people who used to work in MON before, currently 
have views that amaze me. 
  [POLITYKA] So the coalition regards you as a president's 
man, the parliamentary opposition regards you as a coalition 
minister, and extraparliamentary opposition regards you as a 
representative of the old, postcommunist military cadre. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, this kind of labeling does 
exist, but it is a question of approaching defense issues 
through political games and personal ambitions. We are still 
not successful in overcoming those phenomena. The blame for 
such labeling is to be attributed to all political orientations, 
and even the Army itself is not free of it. 
  [POLITYKA] Does the opposition currently have a competitive 
concept of the development of the Armed Forces? Are these ideas 
worth debating, or is it just a case of teasing the minister? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I have not come across any coherent concept 
like that. The extraparliamentary opposition is almost 
completely absent from the debate--apart from Romuald 
Szeremietiew's writing, which appears from time to time, and 
which is nothing new, anyway. When it comes to the parliamentary 
opposition, they exploit some decisions that are made, for the 
purpose of political games and making excessive complaints. Let 
us take the first example that comes to mind: the issue of 
subordinating the military special services to the chief of the 
General Staff, who is responsible for designing operational 
plans and who therefore must have the necessary instruments for 
that purpose. And that does not mean abandoning supervision 
over these services--on the contrary. I have set up an office 
for special services, which, on the minister's behalf, 
formulates general tasks stemming from the country's defense 
policies and controls the implementation of these tasks and the 
necessary expenditures associated with them. 
  [POLITYKA] So, if you have your own concept, should you not 
be defending it publicly? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] But I do defend it in cases in which I am 
attacked. I think that an overwhelming majority of the Sejm 
National Defense Committee has taken a positive stand on my 
concept. Sejm Deputies Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Bronislaw 
Komorowski are surprising exceptions in that regard; they should 
know better than the rest how the mechanism functions. But they 
are the ones making a great fuss that the current minister is 
abandoning his power by relinquishing everything for the sake of 
the chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army. They also say 
that the old ways are coming back. Well, the opposition is 
often guided by immediate political interests, and it postpones 
real arguments until "better times." It is a tactical maneuver 
that is applied not just in this country. There have been 
similar accusations concerning changes in the educational 
services, but it is precisely Sejm Deputy Komorowski who has 
built this huge apparatus of people, many of whom are 
incompetent, ignoring the fact that a majority of forces should 
be directed to the troops, which is where the educational work 
is taking place. The role of MON's educational department 
should be limited to programming educational work, cooperating 
with other ministries, establishing good rapport with the mass 
media, maintaining contact with veterans and youth 
organizations, and, finally, supervising the implementation of 
fundamental principles of educational policies among the troops. 
  In other words, the cap should fit the head. Unfortunately, 
what we are dealing with here is a scout burdened by a huge 
rucksack--a bureaucracy that is excessive compared with common 
sense. 
  Our philosophy boils down to melding the Army and General 
Staff structures that are being modernized with 
programming/supervision structures that are not too elaborate 
and that constitute an efficient element of a system of 
democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. We are widely 
using the experience of Western countries that have been 
applying mechanisms that have stood the test of practice. To 
question such a concept and to make the accusation that the 
minister, a former military man, is trying to reverse the wheel 
of history by trying to reconstruct the old arrangement must be 
regarded as a flagrant abuse, which results also in a conviction 
among the cadre that the "war at the top" is an obstacle to 
solving the enormous problems the Army is facing. 
  [POLITYKA] You have been criticized for your unwillingness 
to place orders with the domestic arms industry. There is even 
talk that you are the industry's gravedigger. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] These accusations only demonstrate the 
power of the industrial/trade union lobbying groups in the arms 
industry. For us to be able to start cooperating with the 
industry in a normal way, these lobbying groups must simply be 
brought down.... To go back to the ill-fated Iryda, the point 
of view of the Mielec plant is this: to maintain what we already 
have, based on the MON budget, without any initiative or 
creativity on the part of the plant itself, and to continue, the 
philosophy is, in case of problems in drafting a budget, to 
force MON to find funds for the purchase of Mielec products, 
including by strikes, even in cases where the equipment offered 
by the plant does not meet the quality standards expected by the 
Army. 
  [POLITYKA] Still, there must be some objective criteria that 
would indicate whether an aircraft is of good or bad quality? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] The manufacturers are well aware of these 
criteria because they have already negotiated for a lowering of 
the criteria. This does not facilitate the competitiveness of 
Iryda on international markets. I am still hoping that the 
Mielec plant will deliver to us the product we have ordered 
before the end of this year, while the plant's management will 
come to understand that we are not just an ordinary customer--as 
it used to be in the past--but a demanding partner. That is 
exactly the position taken by the Swidnik plant, with which our 
cooperation continues to improve. 
  [POLITYKA] Maybe they lack not so much goodwill or skills as 
they do money? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I would not like to analyze this that 
deeply. That is the business of the trade and industry minister, 
as well as of the plant's management. Still, I do know that the 
Mielec plant could have saved itself by accepting an order for a 
series of large transport planes for delivery to the United 
States. So far, they have decided not to use the opportunity 
for reasons that are completely beyond me and that--I hope--a 
special institution established for that purpose will soon clear 
up. To recap, people working in our arms industry must get it 
into their heads that the times when the Army purchased 
equipment and arms "just to follow an order" are long gone, 
never to return. Currently, the very limited state funds 
designated for defense purposes must be spent with great 
caution, and I mean purchasing equipment approximating world 
standards. 
  [POLITYKA] The Polish Army is equipped with arms produced 
primarily according to Soviet technology. How does one go about 
solving problems with overhauls, spare parts, lubricating oils, 
engine oils, and specialized ammunition? Does this not further 
contribute to our dependence on others, as well as to our 
helplessness? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] There are indeed problems, and they are one 
of the main reasons justifying the Visegrad Group's continued 
existence. Recently, this was responsible for extending the 
scope of cooperation to cover Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania. 
All of these countries and ourselves are in the same type of 
situation. Currently, we cooperate with anyone who could be of 
help in maintaining our military equipment at the highest 
possible state of readiness. It is a kind of military 
cooperative of self-assistance among colleagues that, with some 
amount of goodwill, could, through the coordination of research 
and implementation work, minimize the cost and reduce the time 
needed for technical modernization of the Armed Forces of the 
countries concerned. We are trying very hard to convince our 
partners about this concept, but, unfortunately, so far we have 
not scored much success. So, for the moment, we must manage on 
our own. 
  [POLITYKA] In which types of arms could we specialize? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Take, for instance, radiolocating equipment, 
short-range rockets, or helicopters. We also do not hide the 
fact that our rifles are good and much cheaper than similar 
weapons. 
  [POLITYKA] Does "Partnership for Peace" open the door for us 
in terms of Western technology? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] If the program is indeed a direct path into 
NATO, then it must be associated with access to Western 
standards and technology. Unfortunately, Western thinking is 
very much dominated by inertia, especially in the context of our 
sense of a shortage of time. 
  A game is in progress in which Russia is the first on the 
list to push the break pedal. In that country, changes in 
mentality are occurring at an incredibly slow pace, and there 
continues to be deep frustration and a yearning for imperialism. 
  We approach "Partnership for Peace" very seriously, but, if 
it turns out that it is a dead-end street, we will withdraw 
immediately. 
  [POLITYKA] How will you be able to tell if it is a dead-end 
street? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] If the initiative is limited to only joint 
measures within peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, while 
the remaining measures, which would render us closer to NATO 
structures, get mired in fruitless debates, this will be a clear 
warning signal that we are taking part in a game without stakes. 
We will only be able to tell at the end of this year--that is 
to say, after an analysis of the legacy of this year's joint 
military maneuvers--what the real intentions of our partners 
from Brussels are. I hope the net result will be beneficial to 
us. 
  [POLITYKA] Is there a conflict between you as minister and 
the chief of the General Staff regarding who is in charge of the 
Army? Such views are indeed expressed in the press... 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I deny such accusations. In the ministry I 
am in charge of, subordinates do not argue with their bosses. 
But, what is happening is that General Wilecki and I, as well 
as others, have been conducting a debate based on a partnership 
concept, but I must confess it is heated at times and concerns 
the issue of making the management of the country's defense 
system rational. Because of Poland's aspirations, the system 
should take into account mechanisms in operation in NATO 
countries. 
  [POLITYKA] Is General Wilecki's concept different from 
yours? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is, even though he never clearly 
articulated that. The point is that the military, without its 
own will or guilt, was maneuvered into a dispute about the 
country's political system. The debate on the structure of 
managing the country's defense system must lead to a preliminary 
solution, and it must happen before the constitutional debate: 
What type of a state system is there supposed to be in the 
country? Will it be a presidential system or a 
parliamentary/cabinet one? All that makes the solution to 
problems that are significant to the Army more remote. It also 
delays the parliamentary debate of defense issues and slows down 
work on laws that are of crucial importance to the Army. This 
game into which the Army unfortunately has been drawn does not 
serve the state's interests. 
  [POLITYKA] Personnel policies are also part of the 
democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. What is the story 
with the process of building a civilian sector within MON? A 
graduate of the National School of Public Administration has 
complained to us that the Army showed no interest in him because 
the vacancies in the civilian sector must be kept for officers 
who are leaving basic service and are being transferred to the 
reserve. 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Meanwhile, I am just now looking for a 
candidate for chief of the Personnel Division, and, God, I hope 
it will be a civilian! As of today, we can absorb 30 graduates 
of the school you mentioned into MON, but nobody wants the jobs 
because of the low salaries. That is also a factor slowing down 
the "civilianization" of the Army. 
  [POLITYKA] Recently, Colonel Rozbicki, your press spokesman, 
wrote a piece for GAZETA WYBORCZA on the topic of the Army. The 
way the case ended up was that a scandal erupted, and he was 
dismissed... 
  [Kolodziejczyk] That is because he presented himself as 
writing on behalf of the minister, but he had not discussed this 
with me. In the article, he questioned the disarmament treaties 
concluded by Poland. It was a case of arbitrary behavior and 
abuse on his part. 
  [POLITYKA] But he also wrote that his views reflect the 
opinions of a large portion of the officer cadre... 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Nobody has done any research on this. 
  [POLITYKA] At a recent meeting in Brussels, the issue of 
Kaliningrad and the troops stationed there was discussed again. 
Is it your feeling that Russia is trying to evade a neighborly 
discussion on defense issues? 
  [Kolodziejczyk] Absolutely yes. What is happening is that a 
superpower whose position was once significant but that is 
currently going through major problems is demonstrating 
sulkiness. Poland is the most active country in its efforts to 
join NATO. For that reason, among others, Russia has a sick 
obsession about us because it thinks we are the ones who are 
leading others down the road to NATO, and Russia thinks we are 
doing this against the interests of those countries. Our 
Russian neighbors do not want or cannot understand that NATO is 
going through a deep transformation--from a military bloc to the 
foundations of a common security system that is emerging on our 
continent. I also regret the fact that bilateral relations, 
despite our openness, are not as good as those with our 
remaining neighbors. Minister Grachev has been saying for some 
time now that his agenda is filled with events and that is the 
reason he cannot come to Warsaw. And I say to that: That is 
your mistake because we must sit down and explain to each other 
some arguments, exchange reasons and opinions, and jointly look 
for mutually beneficial solutions. But I hope that now that 
Russia has joined "Partnership for Peace" there will be a better 
climate for our mutual relations to develop better. 
  [POLITYKA] We thank you for the conversation.

  [Text] The government has approved the final version of a 
document entitled "The Fundamental Issues of Poland's Defense." 
The text does not contain a clause on the superiority over 
armed forces. The National Defense Committee [KOK] has excluded 
this issue for separate examination. National Defense Minister 
Piotr Kolodziejczyk, when presenting the guidelines of the 
document on the fundamental issues of Poland's defense, said 
that it would be possible to embark on modernizing the Polish 
Army when the state budget expenditure on defense reaches the 
level of 3 percent of the gross domestic product. At present, 
the Ministry's budget stands at 2.1 percent of the state budget 
expenditure. 
  Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that, if expenditure on the 
Army is increased by 0.3 percent each year, the Polish Army will 
achieve Western standards in 20 years. 
  [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The pace of technological 
modernization within the armed forces will depend on the amount 
of money guaranteed by the budget. We are pressing for 3 
percent of the gross domestic product. Only then will we be 
able to say that we are embarking on a gradual, slow, 20-year 
process of modernizing the Army. The modernization should bring 
our technological standards up to those of Western armies in 
roughly the year 2015. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Article by "pw": "Government on Army, Without Discussion"] </F>
  [Text] The government approved a document yesterday 
entitled "Fundamental Problems of the Polish Defense System." 
Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk will not present the 
document to the Sejm until this fall. 
  As Minister Kolodziejczyk told reporters, the document 
contains several options for the development of the Polish Armed 
Forces, but their implementation depends on the availability of 
funds. According to the minister, there is a "positive approach 
among Sejm deputies" on the issue of increasing defense 
expenditures. The minister told GAZETA WYBORCZA, however, that 
Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko's approach is "not positive." 
  Kolodziejczyk says that, provided armament expenditures 
reach 
the level of 3 percent of the GDP over three years, the Polish 
Army will reach a level similar to NATO armies by the year 2015. 
  Of course, we want the size of the Army cut down, and we 
want 
to have 12-month military service introduced, but an army like 
that must have modern equipment and be well trained, so as not 
to decrease the state's defense potential, the minister said. 
  The Defense Ministry also wants to reform civil defense 
structures and transfer them to the supervision of the Internal 
Affairs Ministry.

<F P=106> [Interview with Aleksander Kwasniewski, chairman of the </F>
Democratic Left Alliance, by Ewa Rosolak; place and date not

  [Excerpts] [Rosolak] A week before the self-government 
elections, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] claimed that it 
would be satisfied with a result in the vicinity of 20 percent. 
On the Friday before the elections, you said: "We will not 
lose these elections." How does the party evaluate the results 
today? 
  [Kwasniewski] We are satisfied. Our forecasts proved 
correct and so did my statement that we will not lose these 
elections. One can even say that we won them. I am also 
talking about Warsaw, which really makes me happy, and about the 
very good result in Krakow. We are the grouping that has major 
structures and support in large and medium-sized towns and 
cities; we are also present in the countryside. Thus, we are 
unique, in a way. 
  [Rosolak] You also suggested that the elections would 
confirm the political trends shaped in September... 
  [Kwasniewski] And they did confirm them. The main groupings 
are the SLD and, in the countryside, the Polish Peasant Party 
[PSL] and the Union of Freedom [UW]. The right wing, which has 
drawn conclusions from the September elections and united, is 
another force in this configuration. 
  The SLD has reasons to consider these results satisfactory. 
Still, the low turnout is undoubtedly sad. This means that the 
ideas of self-government and the civic society still remain more 
in the sphere of slogans than reality. 
  [Rosolak] The SLD has obtained influence in towns. However, 
does this mean that it will also share power? 
  [Kwasniewski] These are two different things. In the 
previous term of office, we had approximately 800 members of 
municipal councils; today we think there will be 10 times as 
many. Thus, our position in municipal and gmina [smallest 
administrative units] councils is certainly increasing. This is 
our first try at self-government because so far we have been 
present first and foremost in the parliament. This is going to 
be a great test for my colleagues. In such towns as Sosnowiec, 
Wloclawek, Czeladz, and Stargard Szczecinski, we are obliged to 
take over all of the issues. 
  In other places, we will hold talks on coalitions. We are 
open to all kinds of configurations; however, I will now be 
quite frank and say that we will neither throw ourselves about 
or fall into despair if it turns out that we are merely a strong 
opposition. I even believe that the role of a homogeneous, 
constructive opposition might turn out to be important and 
useful for our members of municipal councils; it might help them 
gain new experience. 
  If UW definitely goes in the direction of a coalition with 
the right wing, then, as Marek Borowski correctly pointed out, 
it will not be the first case of such a union. They usually did 
not gain much as a result, but, after all, it is their own 
decision. 
  I also think that this will clearly define the 
responsibility 
of these groupings for everything that is going on there; so, 
there is really nothing to envy... As the opposition, we will 
control these authorities and suggest better solutions. I also 
think that we will be getting ready for the next elections. 
  [Rosolak] Do you not fear the so-called anti-SLD coalition? 
  [Kwasniewski] No, I do not. It may be formed, but it is 
just as likely as a coalition with the participation of the SLD. 
We are talking about politics. I am amused by evaluations that 
are supposed to belittle our results, as well as by opinions 
that we did not receive 50 percent of votes everywhere... In 
the parliamentary elections, we obtained 20 percent, so we are 
not a majority in the Sejm, either. Thus, it would be difficult 
to expect that we will all of a sudden win the majority of votes 
in the self-governmental elections. [passage omitted] 
  [Rosolak] You have established numerous coalitions with the 
PSL in the regions. What separates coalition members in 
regions, and what brings them together? 
  [Kwasniewski] Generally speaking, the characteristic thing 
about self-governmental elections is that there are more issues 
that bring people together than issues that separate them. It 
is difficult to expect that great disputes or passions will be 
related to the communal infrastructure or other issues that are 
within the powers of self-governments. 
  The analysis of the results of the elections showed that 
the PSL is not an all-national party but a party that is really 
strongly linked to the rural electorate. The results that the 
PSL received in towns are poor. This is the problem when you 
want to transfer the coalition with the PSL to towns. In towns, 
we are, in fact, alone and must fight against UW alone or fight 
along with UW against the right wing. 
  [Rosolak] The coalition with the PSL comprises the 
government. One can continually hear the following statements: 
"The left has blurred its image through the coalition with the 
PSL; its ability to reach a compromise is greater than that of 
its peasant partner." What is the price of the coalition? What 
is the limit of compromise? 
  [Kwasniewski] Every decision has its price. I believe that 
we have confirmed that we are solvent. It is worth recalling 
that it was predicted before the elections that many misfortunes 
would befall us. The right wing said that we would lose; others 
kept saying that our alliance with the PSL would yield us 
negative results; still others feared that our rational economic 
program was not very leftist, and, therefore, we would obtain 
fewer votes. 
  I believe that many of these accusations have been proved 
false. I believe that our voters will understand that the SLD's 
compromises result from the feeling of responsibility: from the 
fact that we think in terms of responsibility for the state, not 
in terms of disputes over our own positions, ministerial posts, 
and so on. 
  I am also happy with the fact that the statements that our 
electorate expected miracles have proved false. It turned out 
that our electorate is very conscious; the people know and 
understand that successes are not achieved overnight and that 
they call for hard work. 
  I believe--please do not think I am boasting--that, 
generally, it is becoming increasingly clear that we are number 
one on the left side. It is also obvious that, if the 
social-democratic left wing is crystallized anywhere, it should 
be crystallized around us--with our significant participation. 
I am convinced about that. Thanks to our openness, which you 
have criticized, we will be able to count on cooperation and the 
presence of others who want to join us. 
  The Polish political system is shifting toward a four-party 
system: the left; the right, with very strong Catholic and 
national views; the center, including UW; and the peasant party, 
the PSL, which, because of its structure, will be an important 
grouping in our country for many years to come. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Rosolak] The Constitutional Committee of the National 
Assembly has already familiarized itself with six draft 
constitutions. You say that the differences concern 20 percent 
of the issues that are found in the Basic Law. Among the 
controversial issues, you list relations between church and 
state, the political system of the country, and social rights. 
How do you see the possibility of reaching a consensus in a 
situation in which the dispute concerns the most vital problems? 
  [Kwasniewski] Eighty percent are articles on which a 
consensus can be easily reached; 20 percent involve key 
disputes. The discussion will be finally ended through a vote. 
There is no other possibility. We will seek a compromise 
wherever it can be reached. The National Assembly will settle 
the issue, which will be finally decided in a nationwide 
referendum. 
  [Rosolak] As chairman of the Constitutional Committee of the 
National Assembly, you said that we would have a new 
constitution by last spring. If the statements by Minister 
Falandysz are also the opinions of the president, the first 
citizen does not really look forward to the constitution's being 
passed anytime soon. 
  [Kwasniewski] I think that the president is supporting the 
schedule that has been accepted by parliament. It is an 
ambitious and logical schedule because it is reasonable to elect 
the president when the conditions of the contract are already 
known. It would be really bad if the president were elected in 
line with the regulations that are binding today but that may 
change later on. This might gave rise to the following question: 
Does the newly elected president have to accept the conditions 
created after he was elected? I think that the proposed 
sequence of events is more natural. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [TA SR report: "Jozef Moravcik Versus Vladimir Meciar"] </F>
  [Text] Bratislava--In an interview for the TA SR, Prime 
Minister Jozef Moravcik yesterday described as very incompetent 
former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's allegations, made in an 
interview for SMENA NA NEDELU, that the official tours of duty 
of current government officials were "tourism for taxpayers' 
money." Moravcik stated that, if he were to compare official 
trips before [under Meciar's government, when he was foreign 
minister] and now, the present ones are far more concentrated 
and businesslike. He specified that one of the serious 
shortcomings under Vladimir Meciar's government was that, from 
the viewpoint of diplomatic practice, official trips were not of 
the required standard. Moravcik stated that, throughout his term 
as prime minister, Meciar did not pay a single official visit to 
any country of the European Union [EU] because of the lack of an 
official invitation. In that sense, Moravcik's visit to France 
was the first official trip made by a Slovak prime minister to 
an EU country since the founding of the independent Slovak 
Republic. 
  According to Moravcik, the trips of the other Cabinet 
ministers can be positively evaluated as well. The level at 
which they are being received is higher than was the case of 
representatives of the previous cabinet.

<F P=106> [Interview with Peter Weiss, chairman of the Party of the </F>
Democratic Left, by Robert Kotian and Maria Hluchanova; place 
and date not given: "It Seems, for the Moment, That the Present 
Coalition Will Continue"] 
  [Text] [SME] How satisfied are you with the functioning of 
the coalition government now that the first half of its term is 
over? 
  [Weiss] The coalition government is a certain experiment in 
Slovakia. Our most recent political tradition did not know this 
form of government before. From this viewpoint, it is good that 
we have made this experience, and not only for reasons of the 
development of political culture. It also means an enrichment 
for political entities, which are forced to build on what they 
have in common and not on what divides them. It requires the 
ability to talk and harmonize views. We have been successful in 
that so far, even if things were not ideal. When looking back 
at the 100 days of this government's work, I admit that, when we 
started, my worries were greater. 
  [SME] Before this coalition was formed, you operated as an 
opposition party. By taking control of some important economic 
government posts, you have been forced to "show" your cards, 
especially in the economic sphere. Do you think this was a 
benefit or a loss for the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left]? 
Views have appeared to the effect that, in some areas, you are 
pushing for overly "socialist" methods.... 
  [Weiss] We decided to join the coalition after considering 
all domestic and foreign political factors. Being in power 
after spending four years in opposition also brings with it, 
apart from the possibility of influencing the course of the 
economy, for example, by one's own policy, certain negative 
aspects. In particular, we were taking over the heritage of the 
economic policy of three governments that we had criticized. It 
is possible that shortcomings with their roots in the previous 
period will be ascribed to this government. This showing of 
cards that you mentioned was, in my opinion, not only of 
domestic political significance, but also of foreign political 
significance. For example, following the appearances by Deputy 
Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova, no one can have any doubts 
about the SDL's attitude toward economic transformation. Quite 
the contrary, it is clear that we have our own ideas about 
transformation. Of course, there are differences of views with 
the other [coalition] parties regarding the timing of certain 
steps and their scope. For these reasons, being in opposition 
was easier. 
  [SME] You spoke about "accelerating transformation," which 
is not a typical SDL term. 
  [Weiss] I would like to know where you got this. If you 
carefully studied our documents at least once, you would never 
have been able to make such a statement. 
  [SME] I know your preelection program, about which we agreed 
with [SDL Deputy Chairman] Mr. Fogas that it is not a typical 
left-wing program.... 
  [Weiss] I cannot agree with you. Economic realism cannot be 
passed off as a right-wing attitude. Our program was realistic. 
For example, all of our warnings regarding small-scale 
privatization have come true. Employees [of privatized 
businesses] have lost motivation, Dutch auctions [during which 
the price is bid down, if no buyer can be found for the calling 
price] have brought with them negative concomitant phenomena, 
privatization has been criminalized, the credit portfolios of 
many banks are burdened with credits that they were often forced 
to extend for political reasons, and so forth. What is 
right-wing about this SDL attitude toward small-scale 
privatization? It has simply been proved that we had more 
political realism than the then government. Economy is 
something objective. We want the inevitable changes to be 
carried out in the socially most acceptable manner. 
  [SME] Let us return to the coalition. What unites you, and 
what divides you? 
  [Weiss] There were several key factors. First of all, it 
was necessary to put an end to the protracted political crisis. 
We had a minority government for a long time. It was in a 
minority position through the fault of the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] 
because the parliamentary groups of these parties had broken up, 
and the ruling HZDS was unable to find permanent allies. The 
second factor that united us was interest in the stability of 
the constitutional system. Clear tendencies were making 
themselves felt toward a self-serving change of the 
constitutional system--away from the parliamentary system toward 
a presidential regime. This was to be achieved through the 
renewal of the balance of forces after the elections, by means 
of a referendum that was being prepared. The third thing that 
united us was the essential need to react to the frequently 
chaotic and improvised economic policy and to the fact that, in 
some areas, the transformation processes slowed down or ground 
to a halt. Fourth, it was necessary to change Slovakia's image 
abroad because we were drifting, literally, into political 
isolation. Of course, it was also inevitable to establish 
conditions for a solution to the minority issues and, thereby, 
meet the obligations assumed by the previous government on being 
admitted into the Council of Europe. Fifth, it was the 
perception of politics as politics of cooperation. We rejected 
a continuation of the policy of creating the image of an enemy, 
the policy of a permanent search for traitors and Judases, which 
is a residue of the deeply ingrained neo-Stalinist political 
culture or, rather, lack of culture. 
  What divides us? The very fact that this is a 
left-center-right coalition with different ideas on economic and 
social policy. There exist two instruments for overcoming these 
differences. The first is the government policy statement, 
which is a measure of compromise on programmatic issues that is 
acceptable to everyone. The second instrument is the Coalition 
Council, whose decisions are conditional on everyone's agreement. 
  [SME] In this context, we could mention the so-called 
screening law, [the amendment of] which probably will not pass, 
precisely because of this mechanism in the Coalition Council. 
Do you consider it normal that members of the government cannot 
defend themselves against accusations of cooperation with the 
[communist-era secret police] StB only because there is no one 
to issue screening certificates? 
  [Weiss] The screening law must be abolished because 
screenings have, from the very beginning, served as an 
instrument of dirty political struggle. 
  [SME] Yet the law exists. It is valid but, in reality, it 
is not being enforced. One possibility is to abolish it, the 
other to amend it.... The coalition has so far been unable to 
sort out this problem. 
  [Weiss] We were aware of our coalition partners' different 
views and were therefore ready to accept a solution that would 
not force any political partner to breach his election program. 
We proposed an amendment to the screening law, under which only 
those sections would remain in force regarding StB collaborators 
who were involved in the struggle against the so-called internal 
enemy. It is therein that I see the biggest moral burden 
requiring a solution. In other words, we proposed that people be 
exempted from this law who had to protect state secrets, for 
example, and the like. The coalition partners from the center 
grouping subscribed to a similar view. The idea of the 
Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is that the screening law 
must be preserved. Each entity is simply bound to its voters, 
and, because no solution has been found, we will have to wait 
for one until after the elections. 
  [SME] However, the failure to resolve the situation could be 
regarded by voters as the coalition's defeat.... 
  [Weiss] Why should we characterize it as defeat? I was 
convinced that we would find a way of amending the law that 
would be generally acceptable. The KDH refused to accept an 
amendment, and, therefore, it is not within the powers of the 
coalition to resolve the issue of screenings. 
  [SME] What, in your opinion, is the most realistic model of 
a political grouping that will form the government after the 
elections? 
  [Weiss] That will be determined by the specific election 
results. It is generally true, however, that, when a 
continuation of the present coalition will be considered, there 
will be more time to prepare the government's programmatic aims 
and to deal with problems we have deliberately put aside during 
this term of office because of lack of time. 
  [SME] Apart from the model of the present coalition, is 
there any other scenario of government that the SDL would accept? 
  [Weiss] The government must be founded on a majority that 
will be capable of action and will enable laws to pass in 
parliament. 
  [SME] Is there a model that is absolutely unacceptable to 
the SDL? 
  [Weiss] In which sense absolutely unacceptable? There are 
at least four or five postelection scenarios.... 
  [SME] Is some political entity unacceptable to you as a 
coalition partner? 
  [Weiss] A coalition alliance with nationalists and 
extremists of any kind is unacceptable to us. We realize, of 
course, that a certain programmatic proximity and respect are 
necessary for a coalition to be formed. Therefore, we can 
scarcely imagine coalition cooperation with those who want to 
break up their future coalition partner and straighten its 
leadership, with those who have a completely different 
understanding of politics and of the stability of the 
constitutional system. 
  [SME] Do you think those ideas correspond with the ideas of 
SDL members? 
  [Weiss] Seventy percent of our members have endorsed the 
decision of the SDL club of deputies to join the coalition. Our 
problem is not the attitude toward the policy of the previously 
ruling HZDS. Rather, it is the attitude toward the KDH that 
constitutes a problem, owing, on the one hand, to programmatic 
differences and, on the other, to the statements made by KDH 
representatives about the SDL, which are still vivid in our 
sympathizers' memories. Of course, a problem also rests in the 
support that this government gets from Coexistence and, more 
specifically, Mr. Duray, in view of some of his statements. 
  [SME] If we understood you correctly, you can scarcely 
imagine a coalition with the HZDS, judging from what you said. 
Whom are we supposed to understand by the terms "nationalists" 
and "extremists"? 
  [Weiss] As for nationalism, it is quite evident that this 
path has been embarked upon by the SNS and by a part of the 
Coexistence movement, which is actually the SNS's partner in 
this game. Extremists organized in political groupings, such as 
exist in Germany, for example, are fortunately nonexistent in 
Slovakia for the time being. I can say, however, that we cannot 
imagine cooperation with the Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] 
because it is engaged in a policy that we have abandoned, and we 
do not want to return to the past. What is interesting in this 
context is the unanimity of views on some issues between the KSS 
and the HZDS, as presented, for example, in the daily REPUBLIKA. 
  Regarding the HZDS, I would like to say that it was, is, and 
will be differentiated. I do not lump all of the people from 
the HZDS together. There are groups in it that I know would 
never think of giving the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to 
a recent incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan 
Luptak greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament, 
who has black hair and wears a moustache, with "Heil Hitler"]. 
We would be able to imagine cooperation with those people. 
They regret themselves that the HZDS leadership did not 
sincerely try to cooperate [with other parliamentary parties]. 
Right now, I do not have the feeling, however, that the 
currents represented by these people have prevailed in the HZDS, 
also on the basis of the general style of HZDS policy and its 
ability to cooperate with others as true partners. 
  It seems, for the moment, that the present coalition will 
continue, provided all of the constituent entities get into 
parliament. Everything will be determined by the voters. Our 
coalition quatrefoil [reference to the "Left Choice," the 
SDL-led coalition of four left-wing parties and movements] 
naturally seeks to win the largest possible number of votes.

<F P=106> [Article by "vg": "Talks With the Hungarian Civic Party Can </F>
Begin; Miklos Duray and Vojtech Bugar Signed Coalition Agreement 
Between Coexistence and the Hungarian Christian Democratic 
Movement"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Miklos Duray, chairman of the 
Coexistence movement, and Vojtech Bugar, chairman of the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], signed a 
coalition agreement yesterday. As Miklos Duray stated at a 
subsequent briefing, the aim of the coalition agreement is the 
formation of a political alliance that will be able, in a 
political struggle, to develop the law-governed state and 
strengthen democratic forces. The coalition partners agreed on 
close postelection cooperation in and outside parliament, as 
well as on the establishment of joint committees for the 
coordination of policies in the spheres of self-administration, 
economy, and education. According to Vojtech Bugar, the 
agreement is a preparation for postelection scenarios and is 
designed to meet the expectations of Hungarian voters. The 
agreement is subject to ratification by the supreme bodies of 
both political entities. Both chairmen stressed that the 
political part of the agreement would be published in full, 
while the publication of its other parts, as well as the number 
of parliamentary clubs, will still be subject to talks. 
  As the MKDH chairman went on to say, the agreement provides 
for the possibility of another partner entering this coalition; 
talks on the possibility of expanding the coalition with the 
Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] opened yesterday. In the event of 
agreement with MOS, a new coalition agreement will be signed, 
which will also contain a section anchoring "very close 
cooperation. Such cooperation is necessary because we know 
that, during the two years of the Hungarian coalition's 
existence, there have been various attempts to break it up," the 
MKDH chairman added. 
  Responding to the demand of MOS Chairman L. Nagy for a 
25-percent representation of his party on the common slate of 
candidates, as this corresponds to the number of "Hungarian" 
votes MOS won in the last elections, Vojtech Bugar said that 
proceeding from the results of two years ago was unthinkable. 
Miklos Duray even qualified this condition as ridiculous.

<F P=106> [Article by "ze": "Vojtech Bugar in First Position"] </F>
  [Text] The editorial office of [Hungarian-language Slovak 
daily] UJ SZO asked its readers in which Hungarian politician in 
Slovakia they have the most confidence. According to the 1,153 
responses received, the largest number of votes, 798, went to 
[Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement Chairman, MKDH] Vojtech 
Bugar. [Chairman of the MKDH parliamentary group] Pal Csaky was 
second, with 683 votes; [Coexistence Deputy Chairman] Arpad 
Duka-Zolyomi third, with 492 votes; [Coexistence Chairman] 
Miklos Duray fourth, with 357 votes; and [Hungarian Civic Party, 
MOS, Chairman] Laszlo Nagy fifth, with 257 readers' votes. 
Similarly, the MKDH received from the readers of the 
Hungarian-language daily 533 votes; Coexistence was second, with 
380 votes, and MOS third, with 231. The editorial team does not 
claim that the survey was representative. Nonetheless, it is 
interesting and, for the uninitiated, perhaps even surprising 
that Miklos Duray finished only in fourth place and was even 
overtaken by his party colleague Arpad Duka-Zolyomi. Vojtech 
Bugar's popularity is the result of his politically prudent 
decisions. When we consider that it is the result of a 
longer-term trend, it also signals that our Hungarian fellow 
citizens prefer a realistic policy to a radical one.

<F P=106> [Article by Zora Butorova of the FOCUS research agency: </F>
"Moderate Decline of Tension; Slovaks and Hungarians in 
Sociological Surveys"] 
  [Text] There is a wide gap between the views of citizens 
of Slovak and Hungarian ethnic origin on the position and rights 
of the Hungarian minority. Whereas two-thirds of Slovaks 
consider the conditions for the development of the Hungarian 
minority generally favorable, and almost one-third even consider 
the Hungarian minority to be preferred, more than one-half of 
the Hungarian minority assess their rights and conditions for 
development as limited, and only less than one-half consider 
them favorable. The distribution of views is similar to that 
ascertained in fall 1993. 
  Tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations has declined over the 
past few months. Whereas, in October 1993, 40 percent of the 
citizens of Slovakia (41 percent among Slovaks and 34 percent 
among ethnic Hungarians) were afraid of a violent solution to 
the disputes between Slovaks and Hungarians in southern 
Slovakia, in May 1994, only 28 percent of respondents (30 
percent among Slovaks and 11 percent among Hungarians) 
considered this danger realistic. 
  Among citizens of Slovak nationality, one can discern a 
slight increase in accommodating attitudes toward Hungarians. 
The proportion of Slovaks who believe that members of the 
Hungarian minority are less concerned about Slovakia's 
well-being than Slovaks declined from 56 percent in October 1993 
to 47 percent in May 1994. At the same time, there has been a 
slight increase in the acceptance of the demand for bilingualism 
among Slovaks. The minority's demand to write Christian names 
and surnames in the native language is now encountering somewhat 
greater understanding among citizens of Slovak nationality. 
Similar to the entire past four years, tolerant and 
accommodating attitudes of Slovaks toward Hungarians can be 
encountered more frequently in ethnically mixed regions than in 
purely Slovak regions.

  [Excerpts] Evidently, our economic relations with Russia 
are of key importance. It is therefore paradoxical that, until 
last week, we had not had one of the basic economic agreements, 
which is the agreement on double taxation with this country. 
[passage omitted] However, the media were more interested in 
the signing of another agreement--on solving the former Soviet 
Union and Russia's debt to the Slovak Republic. Our colleague 
Milan Velecky discusses this subject with Deputy Prime Minister 
Brigita Snegnerova. 
  [Begin recording] [Velecky] Madam deputy prime minister, on 
22 June, the government disagreed with the agreement on solving 
the former Soviet Union and Russia's debts to the Slovak 
Republic. (Subsequently) the state secretary at the Finance 
Ministry signed the agreement in Moscow. You headed the Slovak 
delegation at the Moscow talks. What had changed within those 
48 hours? 
  [Snegnerova] I think that we have achieved a very acceptable 
solution after our negotiations. The Russian side made a 
commitment to resolve the question of the total amount of $385 
million, representing the overall amount owed by Russian 
companies to the former Czechoslovak enterprises, meaning Czech 
and Slovak companies, only after commitments toward Czech and 
Slovak companies are clarified. This means that the part of the 
agreement signed by the Czech side concerning the amounts owed 
by Russian companies to Czech companies will not be applied for 
the time being. 
  At the same time, Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik is 
sending a note to Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin 
drawing his attention to the method of signing the agreement 
with the Czech Republic and stating that the amount of $330 
million represents the alleged debts of Russian companies to 
Czech ones. 
  [Velecky] The Czech side claims this amount is inserted for 
guidance purposes only and does not exclude further negotiations 
about the overall amount. Will there be similar negotiations 
between the Czech and Slovak sides? 
  [Snegnerova] Of course, it is inevitable. On the basis of 
the way we reached this agreement, both the Slovak and the Czech 
sides will be equally interested in starting these negotiations 
as soon as possible. 
  [Velecky] We should have already received more than $1.5 
billion.. This is the amount the Russian side acknowledged as 
its debt to Slovakia. How realistic is the hope that we will 
get it, and in what form is this debt going to be paid? 
  [Snegnerova] On the bais of the decision of the Paris Club, 
Russia can postpone paying the capital of its loan till the end 
of this millennium. [passage omitted] 
  However, Russia will be paying its interest obligations, and 
that is why we tried to speed up the signing of this agreement. 
Part of this payment of interest will begin to be counted only 
after the signing of this agreement. [passage omitted] [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Josef Tucek: "The Army Is Gradually Becoming </F>
Obsolete"] 
  [Text] The Army has decided to withdraw 10 world-renowned 
Russian MiG-29 fighter aircraft from its armory. It will, 
however, keep the somewhat older MiG-21 aircraft, which it wants 
to modernize at least a little. This merely confirms factually 
that the military is becoming obsolete and that no decisive 
change is on the horizon. 
  Few modern weapons can be purchased from the current 
military 
budget. We should not be surprised by this--after all, the 
state has more pressing concerns at the moment than extensive 
rearmament. Of course, the fact that the Army is withdrawing its 
state-of-the-art MiG-29's is rather surprising. The reason 
given, that it is too expensive to operate them, is also not the 
most convincing. It is usually preferable for a modern army to 
have just a couple of state-of-the-art aircraft than a dozen 
obsolete ones. So, the old ground-attack aircraft, in which the 
pilots will learn what it is like to be in the air and wait 
until the Army can afford really modern ground-attack aircraft, 
will remain in Czech skies. 
  The troops in the ground forces are also choosing the same 
path. Instead of purchasing too expensive new tanks, it is 
envisaged that the current T-72-type will be modernized. It 
should be equipped with a better engine and transmission, a 
night-sight system, better reconnaissance, and improved armor, 
and it should be capable of using more effective munition. 
However, it will certainly not become the state-of-the art. 
  The modernization of older weapons and their continued use 
is 
an acceptable stopgap until the state has more money left to 
thoroughly improve the Army's ordnance. This, however, begs the 
question more and more whether it would not be better for the 
country's defense to concentrate on building up an army in which 
the main strike force would be made up of a few but select and 
well-armed professionals. Of the current Army, the 
rapid-deployment forces would come closest to this. However, 
there is also a hitch in forming them. For instance, the Army 
cannot pay adequately or guarantee apartments for those 
interested in serving.

<F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister for </F>
industry, trade, and tourism, by Francoise Delstanche in 
Brussels; date not given: "Prague Does Not Deliberately Delay 
Reforms"] 
  [Text] Privatizations are progressing at a very rapid 
rate in the Czech Republic, but the restructuring of the 
enterprises is lagging behind. Although growth seems to have 
revived, unemployment is not yet a thing of the past. 
  Vladimir Dlouhy, Czech minister for industry, trade, 
and tourism, was recently in Brussels to meet with Leon Brittan 
[European commissioner for external and economic affairs] and 
Henning Christophersen [European commissioner for economic and 
financial affairs]. On this occasion, we questioned him on the 
progress of the reforms in his country. Indeed, the Czech 
Republic is among the countries most convinced that it is 
necessary to carry out the changes rapidly, and it can probably 
afford to do so in view of the healthy state of its major 
macroeconomic parameters. The state budget is showing a 
surplus, and the foreign debt is low, and it seems possible to 
keep inflation between 6 and 7 percent this year. 
  And yet, despite the neoliberal convictions of Vaclav 
Klaus, its prime minister, the Czech Republic sometimes proceeds 
with greater caution than you might think. 
  [Delstanche] The Czech Republic is the one that first 
launched a mass privatization program, especially with a view to 
speeding up the process. Are you satisfied with how it is 
running? And what is the present position? 
  [Dlouhy] Technically speaking, privatization is going well. 
The second phase of the privatization program by coupons should 
be completed by the end of the year. At that time, the public 
sector should no longer own more than 15-18 percent of the 
companies. And we include in this figure the health sector and 
the strategic holdings sector. We will probably therefore reach 
a paradoxical situation because state participation will 
probably be much less important than in many European Union 
countries. 
  [Delstanche] Are there not some problems with investment 
funds, which are being gradually taken over by the banks? 
  [Dlouhy] That is not exactly the case. It is true that the 
banks have created a number of investment funds and that these 
represent approximately 20 percent of the total. But this is 
not the result of the redemption of funds by the banks. Having 
said that, it is true that these funds created by the banks are 
among the strongest and biggest and that they have played a 
major part in the privatization process. They have sometimes 
also carried out debt equity swaps and other operations that 
reflect the financial problems of companies that are part of the 
mass sales program. But why should we consider that the 
participation of banks in the ownership of these funds is a 
problem? I do not think this reflects a problem in the 
privatization process. Obviously, it would be different if the 
banks held 80 or 90 percent of the funds. 
  [Delstanche] Is there not a risk of witnessing too strong a 
concentration of these funds, when they are required to deal 
with financial problems? 
  [Dlouhy] That is true up to a point. But it is clear that 
some funds will fail. That is logical because we have inherited 
a very inefficient economic system, and this is the law of the 
market. It is therefore possible to expect a great 
concentration of property, especially among these funds linked 
to the banks. 
  But I have no fears that this concentration will become 
excessive. And we are also trying to develop, at the same time, 
a strong policy of competition, which should ensure the 
maintenance of a competitive environment, even with a greater 
concentration. Moreover, this is a question that should be 
linked to commercial policy and the opening of the internal 
market to foreign competition and so forth. 
  [Delstanche] In this connection, the OECD detected your 
country's violations of the rules of competition by granting 
favorable treatment in the case of Volkswagen's takeover of 
Skoda. 
  [Dlouhy] It is true that Volkswagen received special 
conditions but not very much if they are compared with the 
treatment offered by Spain and Portugal to foreign investors. 
That is also an exception to the rule. We are well known and 
sometimes even criticized by the international investment 
institutions or the internal opposition because we do not offer 
special treatment to foreign investors. We prefer to offer 
everybody the same conditions. 
  We went against our principles in the case of Volkswagen 
because the automobile industry is very important for the Czech 
Republic. Not only per se, but also because it is the driving 
force for many other companies like textiles, the chemical 
industry, machine manufacturers. 
  [Delstanche] You have a law on bankruptcy, but it has 
clearly 
not been forcefully implemented so far. Is this not a 
contradiction, when your country has chosen to carry out rapid 
reforms? 
  [Dlouhy] It is not a contradiction. Our law is good. So 
far, it is true, there have not been many bankruptcies, but this 
is not because of the legislation. It is the result of the fact 
that the privatization process has not yet been completed and 
that the new owners are not making the restructuring very 
rapidly. This is also the result of internal insolvency, which 
creates a kind of vicious circle in which everybody is indebted 
toward somebody else, which prevents any flow of payment. 
Moreover, we cannot deny that it is also the result of the fact 
that you mentioned--namely, that some investment funds are 
partly owned by the banks. These institutions that hold shares 
in companies in difficulty do not want to push them into 
bankruptcy but are trying to carry out their financial 
restructuring. 
  [Delstanche] But does this not also correspond to a desire 
by 
the government to delay the explosion of unemployment? 
  [Dlouhy] I can assure you that it is not a problem resulting 
from a deliberate policy. We have always been cautious with 
bankruptcies, but we have never stated that we were going to 
tackle this problem in a gradual way. This is the result of the 
privatization strategy. Obviously, for the time being, we are 
gaining major political advantages from it because the 
unemployment rate is very low. It is now 3.14 percent, whereas 
the economic growth rate has reached 3.5 percent in the first 
five months of the year. However, it is true that we are going 
to face this unemployment problem in the future, but it will 
essentially be a problem at the level of certain regions.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mircea Cosea, minister of state and chairman </F>
of the Council for Coordination, Strategy, and Economic Reform, 
by Mihaela Pantea and Romulus Maier; place and date not given: 
"If the Program Is Not Respected, They Will Dismiss Me"] 
  [Text] The following interview with Mircea Cosea, minister 
of state and chairman of the Council of Coordination, Strategy, 
and Economic Reform, revealed a radical modification in the 
direction of Romania's privatization program. The mainly 
economic principles that Mr. Cosea has followed so far have been 
replaced by mainly political ones, to an overwhelming degree. 
No doubt, Mr. Cosea has an innate talent of "causer," along 
with an intellectual finesse that make him outstanding among the 
members of Vacaroiu's cabinet. However, Mr. Cosea failed in his 
attempt to totally hide the clear pressure he is facing from the 
representatives of the leftist PDSR to limit, at least in the 
first phase, the possibility of concentrating capital in the 
hands of a few businessmen or society people. 
<H5>  Accelerated Privatization Does Not Require Legislative </H5>
Modifications 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Mr. Cosea! The Council you are heading has 
developed a program of accelerated privatization. Is this a 
readapted old program, or a totally new one? 
  [Cosea] This is not a new program; nor can it be a new 
program because other people have considered this problem before 
us. The various programs that are now in circulation under 
various names in Bucharest are actually programs of Prague 
University, namely the programs of Rapacinski and Friedmann. In 
the new program, we are starting from some rules of the game 
that cannot be ignored: 
  1. The current legislation must be preserved although, from 
my viewpoint, it would have been preferable to modify it, namely 
to simplify it and make it more transparent. The present law is 
not very bad, but it is too sophisticated and disregards some 
realities prevailing in Romania, namely the reduced economic 
education and an almost non-existent infrastructure and 
computerization in this area. 
  2. The need for the privatization process to be fully 
transparent because, at the level of the individual person, 
privatization means corruption, quick accumulation of wealth, 
and traffic through influence. 
  3. A maximal simplification of the procedures and methods. 
And very much connected to the above is the possibility 
envisaged in the new program, namely to use a variety of 
privatization methods, not only the MEBO [Management and 
Employee Buy-on] or a standard method, for example. 
<H5>  One Certificate -- One Man -- One Enterprise </H5>
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Concretely, what is the time span of the 
privatization program? 
  [Cosea] In the first phase, the program aims at solving two 
problems: Setting up the system of ownership certificates and 
establishing a secondary capital market in which these 
certificates can be marketed. Through this program, we proposed 
to limit the possibilities of changing these certificates into 
stocks at the enterprises to be privatized, on the basis of "one 
certificate/man/enterprise." We must give equal chances to all 
the certificate owners, at least in the first wave of 
privatization (about 3,000 enterprises eligible for 
privatization beginning with 1 September 1994), because there is 
real social pressure in this direction. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] However, when some people have sold their 
certificates for meager sums, there were generally buyers; in 
other words, there was a certain balance of supply and demand 
  [Cosea] From the viewpoint of the market economy, there is 
indeed a perfect balance. The only problem is that we do not 
have a market economy, and the level of our economic education 
does not allow such an approach. Once a person has sold his 
certificate, I can tell him "good day." But he will ask me what 
the government has done in the last two years to explain to him 
how and when to use these certificates. Nothing! Therefore, we 
thought of an equitable solution, but I repeat, in the first 
"wave" of privatization. 
  The Last Train for Romania [subhead] 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Will such a restrictive measure lead to a 
conflict between the government and the large owners of 
certificates, many of them important supporters of the 
government? 
  [Cosea] In this first phase, privatization will certainly 
create great dissatisfaction. This also explains the lack of 
political will that has been characteristic so far. 
Privatization is a risk and, for any party, it can become a 
factor of losing support. 
  When they accepted this role, those who are in the 
government 
must also have accepted the risk of leaving the game. On the 
other hand, they have an immense responsibility, and knowing the 
moment when actions must be taken is of major importance. This 
moment is the last one for Romania. If we continue to delay 
privatization and continue to be afraid of the possibility of 
losing political support or of a government fall, the risk is 
great.... 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Is this program the best version of 
privatization for Romania? 
  [Cosea] In any case, this program will accelerate 
privatization and, in the second phase, by liberalizing the 
exchange system of the aforementioned certificates (beginning 
with 1 January 1995), a series of improvements will be made to 
allow access to an unlimited number of certificates on the 
market. 

<H5>    There Are No Declared Enemies </H5>
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] Could this program be blocked by a 
decision? 
  [Cosea] Theoretically, it can be blocked at the level of 
three factors: the Private Property Funds, the State Property 
Fund, and the Government Property Fund. However, it has no 
declared enemy yet. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] You advance the possibility of privatizing 
3,000 enterprises in the framework of this program by the end of 
this year. The representatives of the World Bank in Bucharest 
showed distrust in this version, and only saw the possibility of 
privatizing a few hundred enterprises at this stage. 
  [Cosea] The program was presented to the World Bank and they 
made some constructive observations with some interesting 
points. I know that there is distrust regarding the number of 
firms that can be privatized this year, but I think that we can 
carry out what we have decided. 
  [ROMANIA LIBERA] You are the first Romanian official who 
connected his position to the implementation of a certain goal. 
You declared that you would have resigned if the treaty with 
the IMF had not been signed at the end of 1993. Will you do the 
same if this program is not fully implemented? 
  [Cosea] I think that, before I resign, if the program is not 
implemented, they will dismiss me!

<F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Ajanovski: "Indispensable </F>
Negotiations"] 
  [Text] Do you remember the statements of former Greek 
Prime Minister Konstantin Mitzotakis that Athens would never 
negotiate with the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]? He made this statement just 
when mutual dialogue for solving the Greek-Macedonian dispute 
had started in New York. 
  Taking over the wheel of the Greek Government, Prime 
Minister 
Andreas Papandreou strongly accused his predecessor for 
accepting such discussions, and he threatened to break them off 
unless Macedonia changed its name. To show how resolute he was 
to break "Skopje," and thus force it into unilateral 
concessions, he imposed an economic blockade, believing that 
this was the way to provide an excuse for breaking off the 
dialogue. 
  Strongly affected and damaged, the Macedonian side clearly 
stated that it would not accept any further negotiations under 
the Greek embargo. 
  At the same time, there was a constant inflow of information 
from New York and Washington that negotiations had not actually 
been broken off and that we might even expect some good progress 
soon. 
  All this indicates that, unlike the violent propaganda 
confrontations between the two states, their diplomats were 
clandestinely doing their jobs. That was something that 
encouraged and pleased us within the overall situation. 
Regardless of mutual relations, the misunderstandings, threats, 
and conditioning, dialogue is indispensable, we might say 
unavoidable, and it represents the only way to overcome problems 
between two states. Malice, blindness, and egoism in policy 
usually causes damage to one's self if reality is ignored. In 
this case, that is exactly what dictates policies and it does 
not admit speculation and bluffing. The fact that the Republic 
of Macedonia is an independent and sovereign state, a member of 
the United Nations, building relations with all its neighbors in 
a democratic manner cannot be easily ignored or repudiated. It 
is also a fact that Macedonia and Greece, as the closest 
neighbors, cannot go on living in isolation and antagonism, 
because otherwise they will contradict their official 
proclamations advocating new relations in the Balkans, such as 
good neighborly relations, open borders, mutual confidence, and 
respect. 
  Because of all this there is no other alternative for 
Macedonia and Greece but to accept and respect European 
standards in constructing mutual confidence. Anything else 
would mean the continuation of the Cold War, which, 
unfortunately, is still widely accepted in the Balkans. 
  In this context, the pressure of the international community 
and the United Nations aims at a more rapid normalization of 
relations as a precondition for a wider stabilization of the 
region. The main question is: How can this be achieved? 
Normally, the international community would not like to take 
over the role of an outside arbitrator and judge of who is right 
and what should be done, but prefers to leave it up to the two 
sides to search for the most suitable solutions through direct 
mutual negotiations. However, it is doing its best to prevent 
either of the two sides from cheating, damaging, or doing 
injustices to the other. It does not want either of the two to 
feel like a winner or a loser, but that there is a genuinely 
acceptable formula for the two sides. The mediating activities 
of the international community are aimed in this direction and 
its assistance is of enormous importance. 
  If this approach toward the solution of the Macedonia-Greek 
dispute is accepted, there are no grounds for any versions or 
claims about instant recipes for the settlement of the dispute, 
that is, there are no precise proposals about the name, the 
flag, or other issues on which the Macedonian side is allegedly 
expected to take a stance. The aims of Greek propaganda are 
impossible to accept, we can even say they are cliches. They 
are trying to create an impression that the whole dispute is 
over these problems and that Macedonia is the one that should 
demonstrate good will, after which Greece will decide what it 
can and what it cannot accept. It is indicative that so far all 
such speculations and alleged proposals were designed by the 
Athens media. Or, as they say, like a hungry chick dreaming of 
corn. 
  It seems that Macedonia's tentative diplomacy shares the 
responsibility for this impression, because it does not want to 
be involved in such speculations and it does not have time 
properly to expound its own position regarding the negotiations 
and the real essence of the dispute. It could do so and thus 
eliminate the doubts and misunderstandings that worry part of 
the Macedonian public. In the absence of complete information 
on what the negotiations are about, bombarded by the abundant 
Greek propaganda, our public, as well as some opposition 
parties, are convinced that secret negotiations are being held 
and that Macedonia's national and state interests are being 
betrayed. This is particularly related to the change of the 
name and the state's symbols, and the top Macedonian leadership 
is being accused of making concessions "to someone, somewhere." 
  In a word, there is an impression that the complex dispute 
consists exclusively of Greek demands, and the outcome of this 
Macedonian-Greek dispute will depend on whether or not these 
demands are met. It is not taken into account that the 
Macedonian position is not to negotiate issue by issue on 
Greece's desires and claims, but wants to put it together as a 
package, dealing with all the issues that can contribute to the 
normalization of relations, which would ultimately open a space 
for overcoming individiual disputed questions. This agreement, 
it was affirmed, would be based on the principles of the 
German-Polish agreement after the World War II, tracing the 
long-term development of mutual relations and a global respect 
for the interests of the two states. 
  Naturally, other questions would be discussed within this 
framework, and Athens has been avoiding them like the very 
devil, being related to various discriminatory measures and laws 
toward Macedonia. These measures are anachronisms in the 
international legal system. 
  This is the only approach that provides opportunities for 
getting out of the current dead end, which has been created by 
senseless demands that can by no international standards or 
principles be subject to negotiation between the two states. 
Only by a full and principled establishment of overall 
relations and by creating a real climate of confidence and 
mutual respect can the current Greek- Macedonian dispute be 
solved to the satisfaction of the two states, which coincides 
with the efforts of the international community and its 
mediating endeavors. 
  There remains the hope that Greece and Macedonia will find 
the strength and wisdom to fight for a model that will open up 
new perspectives in their mutual relations, and also in Balkan 
relations in general.

  [Text] Belgrade, June 28 (TANJUG) -- Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino said on Tuesday that the new Italian 
Government had assumed a more decisive role in the quest of a 
solution to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, for which he 
said it had quite a few reasons. 
  Martino, who is on a brief working visit to Yugoslavia, told 
a news conference at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade that an 
extra reason for Italy's more active role was the summit of the 
world's leading seven industrial countries, which opens in 
Naples on July 8. 
  Martino, who visited Sarajevo and the Croatian capital of 
Zagreb on Monday, said it was necessary to hear all sides 
involved in the conflict. 
  The Italian foreign minister said all officials with whom he 
had conferred during his current Balkan tour had expressed 
pleasure at Italy's more active role. 'We are a neighbouring 
country and we are very much interested in the resolution of the 
problem in the region. and, I, myself, despite all the caution, 
believe that we can find a solution,' Martino told the news 
conference. 
  Martino said that, after the talks held with the Serb, Croat 
and Muslim sides, he had the impression that all sides had 
confidence in the international community. 
  Asked about the peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina prepared 
by 
the international 'contact group', the Italian foreign minister 
said he had not seen the plan yet but expected that it would be 
acceptable to all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
  Asked about the Osimo accords signed between the former 
Yugoslav Federation and Italy, Martino said it was the Italian 
Government's stand that the accords should be respected. All 
territorial issues between Italy and the former Yugoslav 
Federation, i.e. its western republics of Croatia and Slovenia, 
were resolved under the Osimo accords. 
  Slovenia and Croatia, which forcibly seceded in 1991, reject 
everything that has any connection with the former Yugoslavia, 
but, nevertheless, feel that the Osimo accords are valid and not 
subject to revision.

  [Text] Belgrade, 28 Jun (TANJUG) -- Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic today received Italian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Martino, who is paying a visit to the Federal Republic 
of Yugoslavia [FRY]. 
  In the course of cordial and open talks the president of 
Serbia and the Italian foreign minister exchanged views on 
questions of interest for the further successful development of 
bilateral relations and cooperation, as well as those of 
significance for the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, and 
peace and security in the region, reads a statement issued by 
President Milosevic's office. 
  Foreign Minister Martino expressed the readiness and desire 
of the Italian Government to become involved in activities aimed 
at overcoming the crisis in the region. Italy is interested in 
a stable development of cooperation and good-neighborly 
relations with the FRY, with particular emphasis on the interest 
both countries have in strengthening economic links. It is a 
fact that the economic sanctions against the FRY delayed 
realization of many joint projects, which has harmed not only 
the economies of Serbia and the FRY, but also of a number of 
other countries with which Serbia and the FRY are linked and 
interdependent on, to a high degree. Economic sanctions are an 
obstacle imposed on free exchange of goods, circulation of 
people and ideas, their free exchange and communication, and for 
this reason they have to be lifted as soon as possible as 
unreasonable and discriminatory measures that affect the 
interests of several countries, the statement notes. 
  The peace process and activities aimed at ending the war in 
the former Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed in particular. It 
was stated that the international community undoubtedly has the 
responsibility and an obligation to use its influence in a 
determined manner with the aim of having the Muslim side end 
armed provocations and threats, and to finally give up 
aspirations to achieve its goals by war. 
  In the interest of peace the international community has 
high 
responsibility for presenting an overall plan which would not be 
based on an one-sided approach and favoring the interests of one 
side in the conflict at the expense of the other, but on the 
principles of equality, equal protection of their vital 
interests and an unbiased treatment. In keeping with this, 
Serbia believes that the principle of equality -- which has to 
be respected -- also implies the lifting of the economic 
sanctions. 
  Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic also attended 
the talks.

<F P=106> [Article by Tomasz Wroblewski from Washington: "United </F>
States: There Will Be No Military Assistance to Poland"] 
  [Text] Two weeks before President Clinton's visit to 
Warsaw, the U.S. Administration decided to object to a law that 
was supposed to speed up Poland's joining NATO. 
  According to the draft law (written by Paul Simon of the 
Democratic Party and Hank Brown of the Republican Party), 
Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary were supposed to be 
included on the list of countries that would be able to receive 
surplus U.S. defense equipment. Within the framework of special 
cooperation programs, the Polish Army would be able to lease 
U.S. military equipment, draw upon U.S. expertise, and gradually 
change its equipment to make it conform to NATO standards. The 
draft law also envisioned the signing of agreements, using the 
agreement with Korea as a model, concerning rapid supplies of 
aerial weapons. 
  Senators Simon and Brown have expressed their hope that the 
law will speed up Poland's integration into NATO. In a 
conversation with ZYCIE WARSZAWY yesterday, Brown's press 
spokesman confirmed that the Department of State took a negative 
position on the draft law in this form. The White House 
declined comment.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Alena </F>
Melicharkova; place and date not given: "They Gave the Best 
They Had"] 
  [Text] One hundred days have passed since the coalition 
government was established, a government that took the risk of 
preelection failure in times of difficult economic problems and 
a certain polarization in society. The opposition, deprived of 
power, is heaping reproaches and accusations on the government, 
particularly the prime minister. As usually happens, the more 
one tries to expose lies, the more one's truth is doubted. One 
day, however, history will tell us the true story about each 
government. Today, Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik has the word. 
  [Melicharkova] Your government has been in power 100 days. 
It is time to render an account, and we can now safely say 
whether the individual members of the government are the right 
people in the right place. Do you have the feeling that your 
colleagues meet the criteria of the times? 
  [Moravcik] In this period, the government has shown itself 
to be a well-functioning team. We may have different opinions 
regarding certain problems, but it is a very important fact that 
we have always been able to find solutions without having to 
vote on certain problems and actually count the yes and no 
votes. That is, practically all decisions are made unanimously 
after thorough discussion. It is an important fact that this 
government has been formed as a coalition government because all 
of the political groups that are participating in it wanted to 
give the best they had. This, in fact, is the logic of 
parliamentarism, which has proved itself effective also in this 
case. From this viewpoint, I can give a positive answer to your 
question. 
  [Melicharkova] On what basis would you describe your 
government as successful after 100 days? 
  [Moravcik] I will try to be concise. The biggest problem we 
had to face was the budget. It was ill-conceived and of low 
quality, which has mainly affected health care and education. 
In the first days of our government, we were forced to "quench" 
the problems that had arisen. We may consider it a positive 
aspect of this government that we were able to secure the 
conditions for these spheres to function normally. Moreover, we 
should mention another problem, related to the budget deficit. 
From the viewpoint of the transformation of the economy, it is 
very important for us to keep the deficit at a certain level. 
The approved budget contained great budgetary risks. It took a 
lot of energy to eliminate them. We have drafted a project that 
we are presenting to the National Council of the Slovak 
Republic. If it is implemented in the way we have proposed, the 
entire budget system should be consolidated. It is likely that 
this will have a strong impact in the next period. 
  From this viewpoint, it is possible to consider this a 
positive aspect, despite the fact that it represents 
intervention in the tax system. However, we could not have 
agreed with the increasing deficit because it would only mean 
postponing the problem for the future, and, if other problems 
appeared, in addition, a critical situation could arise, which 
is what we want to avoid. The solution to this problem has a 
positive impact mainly on the economy, but, in a way, it is also 
a gift for the next government because it will not have to solve 
this problem. 
  [Melicharkova] Some of the solutions will require a 
considerable amount of funds. We cannot expect them to come 
from abroad only.... 
  [Moravcik] We have succeeded in discovering certain 
resources in the sphere of privatization, despite the fact that, 
in view of the specific privatization method in the previous 
period, the administration of the National Property Fund 
practically incurred a deficit. We had to quickly change the 
entire privatization concept and relations between privatization 
and the National Property Fund, and to draft our own project for 
recovering the National Property Fund. On the basis of our 
measures, we have found resources that we can now use as 
development resources. This means that, in the interest of 
certain development stimuli, we can use these additional 
resources to compensate for certain restrictions in the budget. 
We want to orient them, above all, toward comprehensive housing 
construction, the road network, the construction of highways, 
and development of small and medium-size enterprise. At the 
same time, we have been solving a number of problems associated 
with the normal functioning of all of the branches. 
  [Melicharkova] How are relations between the government 
and parliament? The serious misunderstanding between the former 
government, parliament, and president are well known. Are the 
constitutional officials at the head of this state people who 
are able to communicate and find consensus in the interests of 
the Republic? It is a known fact that the chairman of the 
National Council of the Slovak Republic is a member of the 
opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Do you not have 
confrontations with him? 
  [Moravcik] There is no situation that would allow a 
confrontation. I am not interested in a confrontational policy, 
and it would not even be advantageous. The same applies to 
relations with parliament. As regards our relations with the 
president, communication is very efficient and trouble-free. It 
is in full harmony with what is anchored in the Constitution of 
the Slovak Republic. 
  [Melicharkova] Which of the problems that you inherited from 
your predecessors have you already successfully solved? 
  [Moravcik] The problem of the social fund was critical. The 
solution adopted by the former government was terrible. We 
succeeded in getting the situation in the social fund into 
tolerable shape. However, we are not fully satisfied with 
everything we have achieved. It is a compromise, for sure, and 
we will try to find a more systemic solution. 
  [Melicharkova] People who do not wish you success (and 
thereby slander our state, in fact) affirm that this state has 
no control mechanisms. For example, can the state apparatus 
function without control mechanisms? Is it at all possible? 
  [Moravcik] It is impossible. Every system has to have 
control mechanisms. We do not know the real arguments of those 
who say we do not have control mechanisms. Such an idea is 
really absurd. Each sector has its control bodies. Financial 
control, provided by the Slovak Republic's Finance Ministry, has 
a specific place. Also, the government has a control mechanism. 
At the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic, there 
is a control department to control the fulfillment of government 
resolutions. The Supreme Control Body of the Slovak Republic 
has a most important place. We have abolished the specific 
control body at the Office of the Government of the Slovak 
Republic because such a thing is very strange from the viewpoint 
of the usually accepted control mechanisms. It is something 
that does not exist anywhere in the world. To establish a 
control body at the government office, which, in fact, serves 
the government, and to make a central state organ from the 
office of the government is a concept that is not known anywhere 
in the world. We were possibly the only state in the world that 
had an absurd thing like that. It was therefore quite logical 
for us to change this system and harmonize it with what is 
usually done in the world. The fact is that the control system 
of the Office of the Government of the Slovak Republic was often 
misused to settle personal accounts or to pursue personal goals. 
Such a way of "self-realization" in the state administration is 
unacceptable.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- Hungary's new Parliament 
ended its first session today. The next plenary session will 
take place next week. 
  On behalf of the outgoing government, Prime Minister Peter 
Boross greeted the new National Assembly and the new 
parliamentary officials. 
  The acting prime minister gave a short summary of the 
governing coalition's activities over the past four years. 
  Boross pointed out that Hungary has become a genuinely 
independent, sovereign country, both in political and economic 
terms, while, simultaneously, the institutions of parliamentary 
democracy and rule of law have been established. The political 
stability marking the past few years as well as the recent 
elections have proven the viability of this new, deeply-rooted 
system of institutions, he said. 
  Concerning the transformation of the country's economic 
structure, Boross recalled that the establishment of a market 
economy started in the absence of both of the main components; 
namely, proprietors and capital. 
  Addressing foreign-policy issues, Boross said that after 
four 
decades of isolation, Hungary not only found 70 percent of its 
markets in the advanced industrial states, it also got involved 
in the work of the Council of Europe, the Conference on Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, and the European Parliament, and it 
signed an association agreement with the European Union. 
  The acting prime minister stressed that his government never 
forgot about the ethnic Hungarian communities abroad, which it 
always considered to be an integral part of the nation. 
  In conclusion, Boross announced that, in keeping with the 
constitution, the mandate of his government has now expired. 
From now until the formation of the new government, the 
outgoing government will operate as a caretaker government with 
limited powers, he said. 
  The deputies resolved to put two joint proposals by Prime 
Minister Designate Gyula Horn and Deputy Prime Minister 
Designate Gabor Kuncze on the agenda and label them "urgent." 
The first proposal is to amend the list of ministries of the 
Republic of Hungary, as the new government wishes to dissolve 
the Ministry of International Economic Relations. The second 
proposal is to amend the law on the legal status of mayors in 
such a way that holding the post of mayor should no longer be 
incompatible with also being a deputy. 
  Speaker Zoltan Gal said that Jozsef Torgyan, parliamentary 
leader of the Independent Smallholders' Party, proposed that 
Parliament should set up committees to investigate both the 
explosion that destroyed a door of the Parliament building on 
June 11, and the brutal police action that followed the recent 
soccer cup final between the teams of Kispest-Honved and 
Ferencvaros. The proposal can be put on the agenda only if 
Torgyan presents 78 supporting signatures for it, Gal said. 
  The Speaker said Acting Prime Minister Peter Boross informed 
him that the current government withdraws all its proposals 
presented to, but not yet discussed by, Parliament, with the 
exception of reports and information materials. The prime 
minister added that he is responding to the request by the 
chairmen of the Hungarian Socialist Party and the Alliance of 
Free Democrats with this step. 
  Gal announced that, in keeping with the constitution, he has 
called for a special session of Parliament on July 4-5, to make 
decisions on the proposals labelled "urgent." 
  At the end of the founding session, the recording secretary 
of Parliament read out a letter by Boross to the Speaker in 
which the acting prime minister announced that, after 
coordination with the parliamentary parties and an agreement 
with the new governing parties, he proposes that the President 
of the Republic should relieve Hungarian Television Deputy 
President Gabor Nahlik and Hungarian Radio Deputy President 
Laszlo Csucs of their post.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- The leadership of the new 
Parliament would like to establish good ties with the press and 
reconsider, together with media members, what should be changed 
in the methods for dispersing parliamentary information, Speaker 
of Parliament Zoltan Gal told a news conference after the first 
plenary session of Parliament today. 
  The new speaker and the three deputy speakers of Parliament 
have confidence in the present parliamentary officials and will 
not change the composition of the efficient staff, he said. 
  In reply to a question, Gal said it is essential to modify 
the house rules as soon as possible so that some long and 
needless procedures should be a thing of the past. The bulk of 
work should be carried out in the parliamentary committees, he 
added. 
  The Speaker also said the opposition should be given a wider 
scope of control in the government. 
  In a bid to improve discipline, Gal held out the prospect of 
sanctions to be imposed on deputies who are absent without 
justification. He added that he would like to see a more 
efficient and less costly Parliament, and he will thus initiate 
a revision of entertainment expenses. 
  The Speaker expressed the view that the plenary sessions 
should invariably be broadcast by Hungarian Television, because 
many viewers are interested in them. The concrete conditions, 
he added, should be discussed in autumn with the new leaders of 
Hungarian Television.

<F P=106> [Report on "exclusive" interview for DAILY NEWS by Laszlo </F>
Kovacs, Hungarian Socialist Party nominee for foreign minister; 
place and date not given] 
  [Text] Budapest, 24 Jun (MTI) -- After several weeks of 
coalition talks, the Socialist Party nominee for foreign 
minister Laszlo Kovacs gave an exclusive interview to the DAILY 
NEWS, summing up the major foreign policy trends and objectives 
of the future government and describing the differences in 
emphasis of the next administration as compared to the foreign 
policy of the outgoing conservative coalition cabinet. Earlier 
Kovacs was chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the 
first freely elected Hungarian Parliament. 
  In the interview, Kovacs said, ``The number one objective of 
foreign policy is to ensure the security of the country. The 
second is to help solve economic problems of the country. This 
is particularly important in the case of today's Hungary. A 
third foreign policy objective is the image of Hungary in the 
outside world. 
  ``As for the immediate priorities of the country's foreign 
policy, the first is continuing the efforts to bring Hungary 
closer to European integration. This is a matter of strategy. 
Number two is achieving a balanced relationship with Hungary's 
neighbours. This I would call a matter of urgency. The third 
objective is to support Hungarians living outside Hungary in 
their efforts to obtain guarantees of their minority rights and 
seeing that these rights are implemented. The new government 
considers this to be a moral obligation. 
  ``What is going to change in the relationship of these three 
foreign policy priorities? In my opinion, the three priorities 
are of equal importance, and there is a close interrelationship 
between them. It is unimaginable, and unwise, to subordinate 
any of these to the other. I think it was a serious mistake 
during the past four years that relations with the neighbours 
were of secondary importance as compared to the minority 
question. This policy was counter-productive. Relations with 
our neighbours have deteriorated, so one of the important 
objectives of Hungarian foreign policy was lost in the approach 
which was taken to supporting Hungarians outside the borders of 
this country. If there is no dialogue, then there is no forum 
in which to raise the issues of minority problems. 
  ``The deterioration of Hungary's relations with her 
neighbours has also damaged Hungary's image in the Western 
world. Thus, Hungary suffered a reduced amount of international 
support for solving the minority problem. Hungarian foreign 
policy had no other means to do something for the minorities 
than to broadcast very critical television programmes, to send 
messages to our neighbours. There is no evidence that such 
programmes had any favourable effect on these countries' 
policies towards the minorities. I must repeat, in summing up 
my argument, that the three priorities will be observed 
simultaneously. 
  ``The approach to foreign policy thinking will also change. 
A foreign policy can only be based on the existing realities 
and the actual room for manouver, on the interests of Hungary, 
and on the coordination of the interests of Hungary and her 
partners. In this way of thinking, there is no place for a 
feeling of special mission or historical merits and grievances, 
ideological or political sympathies. 
  ``Another thing that will change is the methodology of 
foreign policy. There can be no pressuring on the other side by 
threatening to reduce the level of relations. We also have to 
eliminate tendencies to isolate any of the neighbours from 
Europe. A condescending attitude must be out of the question. 
  ``When taking the initiative, Hungary must not refrain from 
making gestures to build confidence. It is equally important to 
thoroughly prepare high-level meetings and survey the 
implementation of the agreements signed at those meetings. Such 
high-level visits should not be used as occasions to give 
history lessons. 
  ``Can we expect a six-party consensus in the parliamentary 
control of the activities of the Foreign Ministry? 
  ``The six-party consensus has been working over the past 
four 
years in the basic questions of foreign policy. All the six 
parties agreed on the three priorities of this policy. 
  ``There was no consensus, however, in the practical 
implementation of policies. There were several steps and many 
official statements on behalf of the government which hindered 
rather than helped the realization of these objectives. 
  "The other problem with consensus during the past four years 
was that before an important step in foreign policy, the 
government had failed to consult with the opposition. It 
happened quite often that opposition politicans learned about 
policy decisions from the press. I think a consensus must work 
differently. It is the responsibility of every government to 
involve the opposition in policy-making. It is not the job of 
the opposition to force it, but it is the job of the government 
to allow this to happen." 
  As this interview is to be published in the last issue of 
the 
DAILY NEWS, I want to ask your opinion, does this country need 
an English language public service newspaper summing up 
political and economic developments from a Hungarian perspective 
or should market conditions prevail? 
  ``It is my firm belief that for Hungary it is indispensable 
to have an English language public service newspaper. Hungary 
has an open society with many millions of foreign visitors, and 
tens of thousands of foreign residents working here. From 
diplomats to businessmen and experts, the foreign community 
needs a reliable source of information concerning the political 
and business processes in this country, including both the 
official Hungarian standpoint and the opinions of the individual 
political parties in Hungary, about public life, culture and all 
aspects of this country. There are, of course, three 
foreign-owned weekly newspapers in Budapest but they have a 
different function. They are not public service newspapers. 
  ``I think such an English language paper must be fitted 
into the national information system. This is a totally 
unresolved task. The activities of the recently founded 
National Information Bureau had catastrophic results in the past 
few months. This bureau was set up last year and it was unclear 
from the outset what its job should be. In practical terms, the 
Information Bureau seriously impaired Hungary's image abroad. 
Such an institution should not get involved in arguments with 
the foreign press. It is not the job of such an institution to 
side with the government in internal policy debates and there 
were several other things which should not have been done by the 
Information Bureau. 
  "The Information Bureau should give a trustworthy, objective 
picture of what is going on in Hungary. There were personal 
reasons behind this failure. In my opinion, the Foreign 
Ministry must coordinate information about Hungary. It will be 
one of my first jobs to survey the situation and to work out 
proposals for changes. I think the Foreign Ministry has a 
special mission in supplying information about the country. An 
English language public service newspaper is thus imndispensable 
for Hungary," Laszlo Kovacs, the Socialist Party nominee for 
foreign minister, told the DAILY NEWS.

  [Text] Budapest, June 25 (MTI) -- The presidium of the 
Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) has tendered its 
resignation. 
  In its place, the KDNP National Board elected a smaller 
interim presidium with a six-month mandate in Budapest today. 
  The National Board re-elected Laszlo Surjan as party 
chairman. 
  In the May elections, the Christian Democrats won 22 seats 
in 
Hungary's 386-member parliament, corresponding to 5.7 per cent 
of the mandates. Both the party leadership and the members were 
dissatisfied with the result. 
  The mandate of the interim presidium will expire within 60 
days after the municipal elections this autumn but not later 
than on December 15. 
  Surjan told the press that the KDNP would hold a national 
meeting in autumn to discuss the party's political renewal, 
decide on structural changes, and revise the party rules.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 June (MTI) -- As MTI reported earlier, 
President Arpad Goncz has returned to Budapest, having received 
the Grand Award of the Institute of East-West Studies (IEWS) for 
his contribution to tolerance and inter-nation reconciliation in 
Eastern Europe, along with Slovak President Michal Kovac. 
  At a press conference held at Ferihegy Airport, Goncz said 
he 
informed his American negotiating partners, including President 
Clinton, on the results of Hungary's general elections. "I 
assured the American politicians of the constancy of priorities 
in Hungarian foreign policy, and encouraged them to increase 
their investments in Hungary," Goncz said. 
  At U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with the Hungarian 
and Slovak presidents, Goncz assured him that democratic trends 
are certain to continue in Hungary, and the two main priorities 
of the country's foreign policy will remain the same in the 
future: maintenance of peace and advancing reform processes in 
the region. Hungary intends to improve its relations with 
neighboring countries, Goncz told Clinton, who -- in Goncz's 
words -- "gave his blessing" to this. 
  At the Office of Overseas Private Investments, established 
to 
promote U.S. investments abroad, Goncz suggested that the 
officials send a delegation to Hungary to survey investment 
options, particularly in the energy, environmental, 
infrastructure, food, and information technology sectors. 
  Goncz was very optimistic about his talks with Michal Kovac. 
He voiced his hope that Hungary may be able to sign a basic 
treaty with Slovakia before the next Slovak general elections. 
Once the basic treaty has been signed, links between the two 
states can take a pronounced turn towards a tight and friendly 
relationship, the Hungarian president said. 
  Goncz also told the press that he accepted Kovac's 
invitation 
to the anniversary celebrations of the Slovak Banska Bysrtica 
uprising, and the Slovak president might visit Hungary during 
the summer.

  [Text] Budapest, 24 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's 
Constitutional Court this week approved a new Land Law. In 
April, President Goncz referred the law to the Court for rulings 
on two aspects: The limit on the amount of land to be purchased 
by Hungarian individuals, and the distinction between companies 
and private individuals. 
  The Court decided that setting an upper limit on the amount 
of farmland which can be purchased by Hungarian private 
individuals is not unconstitutional. However, it also ruled 
that the limit must be of temporary validity. 
  The Court also approved the section of the law which 
excludes 
the purchase of farmland by foreign individuals and companies. 
This, it argues, is justified by the average price of Hungarian 
farmland, which is rather low by international standards. 
  Banning Hungarian companies from purchasing farmland is in 
line with the Constitution, the Court declared. The reason is 
that individuals could otherwise set up a large number of 
companies expressly for the purpose of buying land. Thus they 
could acquire large tracts of land escaping the upper limit. 
  Under the law, the maximum amount of farmland that can be 
purchased by Hungarian individuals is 300 hectares or 6,000 
golden crowns. Foreign individuals are only allowed to purchase 
farmsteads with less than 6,000 square metres of land. 
  Although Hungarian companies are not allowed to buy 
farmland, 
they may lease up to 2,500 hectares or 50,000 golden crowns. 
Foreign companies and individuals are allowed to lease up to 300 
hectares or 6,000 golden crowns of farmland.

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 27/6/1994 -- The National 
Peasant Christian-Democratic Party [PNTCD] is waiting for a 
sufficient number of signatures to be gathered in order to start 
the procedure of suspending President Ion Iliescu from office, 
stated PNTCD spokesman Senator Radu Vasile. 
  He cautioned during today's weekly news conference that the 
decision of Romania's Prosecutor General of appellation against 
final court decisions regarding the confiscated houses was a 
direct consequence of President Iliescu's position. 
  Regarding the no-confidence motion [against the Nicolae 
Vacaroiu government], the PNTCD leadership considered that 
irrespective of the results of the vote, a change of the 
government was inevitable, and it did not rule out the 
likeliness of early elections either, considering the grave 
economic situation. 
  The leadership of the PNTCD considers that the Democratic 
Party-National Salvation Front's [PD-FSN] position in the 
opposition is declarative, rather than based on concrete 
actions. Referring to that party's "hesitant" stand on the 
PNTCD's initiative to suspend President Ion Iliescu from office, 
Senator Radu Vasile noted that the PD-FSN was manifest as an 
opposition party "especially on an external plane [abroad]." 
Both Radu Vasile and Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD first deputy 
presidents, disapproved of the PD-FSN parliamentarians' having 
failed to sign so far the list regarding the suspension 
procedure. "This is a conjuncture alliance pursuing to change 
the parliamentary majority," said Ion Diaconescu cautioning that 
this alliance "does not mean we have forgiven the FSN's 
[National Salvation Front] past mistakes made at the time it was 
the ruling party."

  [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 25/6/1994 -- "Political 
undertakings initiated by the Democratic Convention of Romania 
[CDR] regarding a suspension from office of President Ion 
Iliescu and a vote of no-confidence prove the ability of this 
political alliance to act in the interest of the citizens," CDR 
President Emil Constantinescu told a news conference held 
Saturday, 25 June, in Bucharest. 
  "Incitement of local authorities not to put into application 
final court decisions as well as President Iliescu's refusal to 
give an explanation before Parliament are also violations of the 
Constitution and of the principles of democracy," according to 
Emil Constantinescu. 
  As for the censure motion, the CDR front-ranker said that 
"it 
first of all aims to bring a normal terming to the dialogue 
between the government and the country's citizens." 
  Asked about divergent opinions within the alliance, Emil 
Constantinescu and the representatives of other parties in the 
alliance admitted that "several divergent opinions are 
persisting within the convention" which prove, however, the 
democratic spirit of the alliance. While liberal Dinu Patriciu 
has drawn attention on the need for the convention "to become a 
homogeneous political party, a powerful decision-making 
structure" and a right-wing force, Civic Alliance Party 
front-ranker Emil Tocaci considered that tensions within the CDR 
have been magnified, for the convention "will further be a 
reality of the Romanian political life."

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 24/06/1994 -- The Romanian 
Polling Institute IRSOP conducted a June inquest to find out 
what people think about political personalities and topical 
issues of their daily life. The first three in the top appear 
to be Adrian Nastase, executive president of the ruling Social 
Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR, and speaker of the Chamber 
of Deputies, Emil Constantinescu, president of the main 
opposition bloc, the Democratic Convention of Romania -- CDR, 
and Ion Iliescu, the president of Romania. Since March Senate 
President Oliviu Gherman has added some credit to his public 
image, forging a positive impression among 41 percent of the 
interviewed as against only 26 percent three months before. 
IRSOP manager Petre Datculescu said that although personalities 
affiliated or 'close' to the ruling party hold best positions, 
PDSR would lose to the convention should elections be called now. 
  The `negative character' of the poll seems to be the 
government, whose activity causes growing dissatisfaction among 
people, who are equally grumbling against parliament and justice. 
  The answers got under the chapter devoted to living standard 
reveal a feeling of insecurity among the polled persons. The 
ratio of those totally discontent with their living standard has 
risen from 15 to 25 per cent over the past three months. People 
are also growingly apprehensive of price increments and 
unemployment. 
  The barometer of opinion has been conducted by IRSOP at the 
request of the Soros foundation for an open society and is 
focused on the major themes of social and political interest. 
The polling is run every quarter in the months of March, June, 
September and December alternately by two specialized 
institutions: IRSOP and IMAS, which devised their questionnaire 
jointly. The June survey selected a batch of 1,095 persons aged 
18 and over and found representative for Romania's entire 
population, and its margin of error is three per cent.

  [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 28/6/1994 -- For a week the 
city of Cluj-Napoca (North-West of Romania, inhabited by a large 
Hungarian minority) has been living in a state of tension 
created by the conflict between the public authorities and the 
local branch of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania 
(UDMR). 
  The conflict, which is not something new, because such 
situations arose several times in the capital of the historical 
Romanian province of Transylvania, was sparkled by the intention 
of the local authorities to authorize, at the request of the 
Transylvanian History Museum, archaeological diggings in the 
central square of the city where the monument to Hungarian King 
of Romanian descent Matthias Corvinus is located. The local 
branch of UDMR is accusing the City Council, and Mayor Gheorghe 
Funar in the first place, of using the digs as a pretext to move 
Corvinus's statue to another location. 
  "The archaeological diggings planned to start in the Union 
Square of Cluj-Napoca are about 100 meters away from the statue 
of King Matthias Corvinus," the city mayor Gheorghe Funar told 
CRONICA ROMANA. 
  "The UDMR misleads its members, supporters, and the whole 
world, pretending that the unearthings pursue to create a state 
of conflict in the town," Gheorghe Funar also says. His opinion 
is that the tension aroused in the past few days is 
"artificially created, has a political connotation and was 
generated by the UDMR's actions intended to prevent the 
archaeological investigations in the Union Square." He specified 
that the initiative comes from the History Museum of 
Transylvania of Cluj Napoca, which has obtained the approval of 
all the competent fora, and has allotted 10 million lei to the 
project. The mayor himself suggested the local council to 
approve another 30 million lei to sustain the project. 
  Despite assurances from local authorities that Matthias 
Corvinus's statue will have nothing to suffer, "the UDMR 
representatives said they would stage demonstrations and urge to 
civic disobedience, and termed the matter a political issue," 
Gheorghe Funar said. Should any acts of civic disorder appear 
in the town, Gheorghe Funar said he would be the advocate of 
"firm enforcement of the law." 
  The daily ORA carries a commentary in its yesterday's issue 
qualifying the case as part of "the Hungarian concerted strategy 
aimed at having the Trianon Treaty canceled or revised." The 
Treaty of Trianon permitted Transylvania to reunite with the 
mother country after Habsburg and Hungarian occupation was 
abolished. The article in question remarked that "the plan is 
absolutely the same for all the countries having a Hungarian 
minority," and that "from this point of view, UDMR is one of the 
spearheads of this intelligent plan, obstinately followed by 
Budapest." 
  The archaeological investigations due to start next week in 
Cluj-Napoca intend to bring to light the forum of the ancient 
city of Napoca, a Roman colony on the territory of ancient 
Dacia, the cradle of the Romanian people and language. The city 
of Napoca used to be the capital of the Roman Province of Dacia 
Porolisensis, and Cluj-Napoca is celebrating this year 1870 
years from its first documentary attestation.

  [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- The actual problems in 
Albania and Romania, difficulties and the achievements in 
economy and the democratization of life, the necessity of the 
strengthening of the relationship between the two countries, 
were the main issues treated in the meeting between the chairman 
of the Romanian Senate, Mr. Gherman, and Mr. Arbnori, the 
speaker of the Albanian Parliament, in Bucharest. 
  Albania is an old country, with European tradition and with 
geographical and political significance, stressed Gherman, 
pointing out that "the importance of a country it is not 
measured by its square miles." 
  Gherman and Arbnori, also discussed the problem of Kosova. 
Mr. Arbnori expressed Albanian stand toward this issue, 
pointing out that "we are not for border changes by force, but 
this does not mean not to protect the national and human rights 
of the Albanians there." 
  While Mr. Gherman pointed out that Albania will not be short 
of Romanian aid, and it was also confirmed by President Iliescu. 
The solution, he said, should be accomplished only with 
political means, avoiding the war in any case.

  [Text] Bratislava June 28 (CTK) -- Slovakia has conducted 
talks with new Hungarian leaders on the chances of concluding a 
fundamental political agreement on good neighbourly relations, 
Premier Jozef Moravcik said on television tonight, but did not 
specify when the talks had taken place. 
  The agreement would guarantee the unchangeability of the 
present borders and the status of ethnic minorities in the two 
countries. 
  Moravcik said the Stability Pact proposed by French Premier 
Edouard Balladur created very good conditions for the 
confirmation of the existing borders. 
  "Territorial autonomy for the Hungarian minority in Slovakia 
is ruled out, and this has also been accepted by the Hungarian 
party during the talks," Moravcik said. 
  He was reacting to a statement by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar 
that the next Hungarian Premier Gyula Horn had made territorial 
autonomy for the Hungarian community in Slovakia a condition for 
the conclusion of the inter-state treaty. 
  About 560,000 Hungarians live in Slovakia, constituting 
about 
11 percent of its population. Some of their leaders, assisted 
by certain forces in Hungary, have demanded territorial autonomy 
for southern Slovakia heavily inhabited by ethnic Hungarians.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 26 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik, in a televised debate of leaders of the government and 
opposition parties today, said that upon taking power in March 
his cabinet inherited an 8-billion Slovak crown (some $260 
million) hole in the budget to which it had to react with 
economizing and raising taxes. 
  Moravcik accused Meciar of slowing down economic 
transformation. He said his government would speed up 
privatization while using equally the coupon method and other 
methods. He added that the envisaged 4 billion Slovak crown 
profit from privatization would be invested in the construction 
industry to revive the economy. Moravcik pointed to a "historic 
chance" to settle relations with Hungary which requires the 
solution of the problems of ethnic minorities in Slovakia. 
  Meciar said that Moravcik's government came to power not 
through democratic elections but through a parliamentary putsch. 
He said Moravcik's cabinet returned to a restrictive economic 
policy because of the previous non-qualified management although 
the basis for economic growth had been already prepared by his 
cabinet. 
  "It will take at least one year to correct these mistakes," 
Meciar said. He said he considered it "catastrophic" that 
social reforms had been stopped, adding that the prepared tax 
raise would limit a market space, lead to a fall in production 
and a decrease in consumption with a consequent social impact. 
  Chairman of the opposition Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan 
Slota, Meciar's close co-worker, rejected the accusations of 
extremism, arguing that the SNS "was only defending the 
interests of a nation state," while "extremist Hungarian parties 
have embedded a split of the state in their programs." 
  "Three Hungarian -- chauvinistic and irredentist -- parties 
are too much of a luxury for Slovakia," he said. He warned 
against the plans of Moravcik's government to launch the second 
wave of coupon privatization, saying that three-quarters of 
state property privatized during the first wave ended in the 
hands of funds and the impoverished population was currently 
selling their coupon booklets below price to those "who do not 
have honest plans with this republic." 
  Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), 
said that Meciar was responsible for the current state of the 
Slovak economy and society.

  [Text] Bratislava June 30 (CTK) -- Peter Weiss, chairman 
of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), said today he believed that 
after the autumn elections, his party would not be faced with 
any clash due to the allegedly different views of its leaders on 
the possibility of the SDL's coalition with the Movement for a 
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). 
  The SDL is a government coalition party, successor to the 
former Communist Party, while the HZDS is in the opposition. 
Headed by ex- Premier Vladimir Meciar, it has repeatedly topped 
opinion polls and is the SDL's biggest election rival. 
  Weiss assured journalists that SDL representatives would not 
"swallow Meciar's bait." Rumours alleging controversies within 
the SDL which the HZDS is permanently airing through the media 
are untrue, he said. 
  "On the contrary, I have information that a right-leaning 
HZDS faction intends to use Meciar only as an electoral flag, 
which they will put aside later," Weiss stressed. 
  He said he considered speculations about SDL's coalition 
with 
HZDS "without Meciar" premature. First he does not want to view 
the partnership only in an "interpersonal" dimension, and the 
developments after the elections also could be affected by the 
absence of any present coalition party in the next Slovak 
parliament, Weiss said. 
  Speculations about a post-election SDL-HZDS coalition have 
been appearing in the press for certain time. Observers point 
to the possibility of the removal of Weiss by more conservative 
SDL members, or of the SDL's split. 
  Weiss said that real post-election variants would be 
considered by the SDL national council on July 9. He stressed 
that pre- election polls had also to be taken into account, 
according to which up to 70 percent of voters approved Meciar's 
dismissal in mid-March, and most of them would not give their 
second vote to the HZDS, if enabled to vote for two parties. 
  According to the latest poll, the HZDS is supported by 29 
percent of citizens. The SDL is placed second, supported by one 
fifth of voters.

  [Text] Bratislava June 28 (CTK) -- During a heated debate 
in parliament today, Jozef Prokes, a deputy for the opposition 
Slovak National Party (SNS) and former deputy premier, proposed 
to dismiss his former party colleague and current rival Ludovit 
Cernak (now National Democratic Party, NDS) from his post. 
  Although the government coalition deputies refused to 
include 
the issue in the agenda of the current session, it is compulsory 
to convene extraordinary session if a motion is supported by 
more than 30 deputies. 
  The opposition has already put the motion of no-confidence 
to 
Privatisation Minister Milan Janicina (NDS) on the agenda of the 
session. 
  The Slovak Parliament dismissed today Ivan Luptak (HZDS, 
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia) from the Slovak delegation 
to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. 
  At the past parliamentary session Luptak expressed his 
discontent with the work of Cernak, parliament deputy chairman, 
by using the Nazi salute. 
  Luptak had been reprimanded for his behaviour by his own 
HZDS 
Deputies' Club as well as the parliamentary Mandate Committee. 
He had apologised to the parliament and assured it that he was 
an opponent of totalitarian rule. He said, however, that he 
preferred to be dismissed than appointed by the present 
government. 
  The importance of his dismissal is rather symbolical because 
Slovak deputies will not go to Strasbourg before the 
parliamentary elections scheduled for September 30-October 1, 
Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic said.

  [Text] Kosice, East Slovakia, June 24 (CTK) -- Five Romany 
political parties have agreed to join forces for the autumn 
elections under the name Romany Civic Initiative (ROI), the 
party leaders announced at a press conference today. 
  The ROI will also field joint candidates for the local 
elections, which follow a few weeks after the general elections. 
  The ROI hopes to win five percent of the vote so that it can 
enter parliament and defend the Romanies' interests. In 
parliament the Romanies would seek to tighten laws against the 
propagation of racist or fascist ideology, to lower unemployment 
and promote education for Romanies. The parties in parliament 
today have no interest in the Romanies' lot, the ROI says. 
  The Romanies in Slovakia have not acquired the official 
status of a national minority, only that of an ethnic group, 
Romanies leaders say. They estimate there are some half a 
million living in Slovakia, 220,000 of whom have the right to 
vote. The ROI is aiming for 180,000 votes, which would be 
enough to get seats in parliament. 
  The umbrella group comprises the ROI Union, the Romany 
Integration Party (SIR), the Romany Social Democratic Party 
(SNSR) and the Romany Congress and will be supported by the 
Romany Democratic Movement (DHR) and the Romany Party of 
Democratic Union (SDUR).

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 23 (CTK) -- [passage omitted] 
  "No one has proved we violated the law, we were observing it 
until the last day," former Premier Vladimir Meciar says in 
answer to the question of SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA as to whether 
there is any connection between the questioning of the 
privatization projects of his cabinet and the effort of the 
current opposition to the dismissal of Deputy Premier Roman 
Kovac and Privatization Minister Milan Janicina. 
  "Nothing but tiny grammatical errors have been found in our 
privatization projects," Meciar states. 
  "The rumors that we privatized for our partisans are 
rubbish. 
As more than 80 percent of the property was confined to the 
employees' shares, whom could we have supported?" he continues. 
  By contrast, (under the present government) party 
affiliation 
plays a major role which has caused great deal of damage, Meciar 
says. 
  The attempt to dismiss Kovac was an effort to "respect 
certain rules," says Meciar, adding that "if a man himself 
admits his being corrupt, he has no right to be in public life." 
  Regarding Janicina, Meciar says that as a commercial lawyer 
and member of the Privatization Ministry he "is deliberately 
damaging the interests of the state." "Due to this, it is absurd 
that he should be a privatization minister," Meciar states. 
  "Although the matters were proved and properly submitted, 
the 
parliament did not accept them," which proves that neither 
ethics, nor truth nor the principle of the interest of society 
are sought after in the Slovak Parliament, Meciar says. 
  The parliament is dominated by "tough party strategy; either 
you are accepted by the Politburo and you survive, or you do 
not. In order to be accepted, you must serve. And Janicina 
knows whom to serve and why he is there," Meciar stresses. 
  "The whole cabinet is under the thumb of the Politburo which 
orders it how to decide. The only thing it is able to do is to 
make minor comments, no real decisions," Meciar concludes.

  [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 28 (CTK) --- [passage omitted] 
  Coupon privatization in Slovakia is not jeopardized, says 
deputy premier in charge of the economy Brigita Schmognerova in 
an interview with today's issue of SME. 
  In her opinion, emphasis must be laid on the transformation 
of state-owned enterprises into joint-stock companies. 
  Schmognerova sees differences between the ministries which 
are preparing privatization in that the Privatization Ministry 
stresses the overall volume of property to be privatized in 
coupon privatization, whilst the Economy Ministry considers its 
impact on individual enterprises. Schmognerova agrees that this 
impact must be taken into consideration. 
  However, she rejects the opinion that the application of 
this 
method will cause the present enterprises' managements to lose 
their power position. 
  She also disagrees with the view that the SDL [Party of the 
Democratic Left] regards managements as its sphere of influence. 
"At least 80 managements were formed under the previous 
governments in which the SDL had no seats," Schmognerova says. 
  On the other hand, it would be a sin not to motivate capable 
managements by giving them a share in privatization. 
  "But if managements are not capable it would be better to 
replace them," she says.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 24 (CTK) -- Honorary chairman of 
the emerging New Slovakia movement Rudolf Mosny, known among 
other things as the owner of the Saris brewery, today spoke out 
against the coupon method of privatization and the method in 
which it had been applied so far in Slovakia. 
  In the transfer of state property it was enough for a bundle 
of shares in privatized property to be transferred to whoever 
won the competition to take over the state company, and leave 
further gradual privatization to developments in the privatized 
company, he said. 
  The present method of coupon privatization broke up the real 
owner relationship into too great a number of shareholders, and 
consequently companies' dependency on the results of economic 
management was lost. 
  New Slovakia is against the privatization of strategic 
industrial branches, such as energy, gas and telecommunications. 
"The government has to retain control over these basic means of 
influencing the country's economy," he explained. 
  The movement wants to stimulate the successful 
transformation 
of the Slovak economy by changes in tax policy and tax law. 
These should provide foreign capital with suitable conditions. 
New Slovakia representatives said they had already been 
negotiating resources from unspecified countries in the Far East 
and Western Europe. 
  Changes in tax policy would stimulate saving and investment, 
they said. This could be achieved by abolishing savings taxes, 
taxing only that part of incomes which was spent and tax relief 
on investment in machinery and equipment. 
  Turning to the Czech Republic, the movement's economic 
expert 
Jaroslav Zapletal said that if the insolvency of state companies 
was included in the state budget, as was normal in Western 
European economies, the Czech budget would have had a deficit of 
60 million crowns (2 million USD) last year. 
  "The economic results of the Czech Republic are good, but 
they are camouflaged," Zapletal said. In the Czech and Slovak 
Republics the insolvency of state companies was not funded from 
the state budget, but the money had to come from the pockets of 
their suppliers, he added. This was confirmed by inflation in 
the Czech Republic. "There can be no inflation with a surplus of 
four million crowns; if anything it causes deflation," he said. 
  Mosny said the success of economic reform in the Czech 
Republic was the result of successful propaganda. The economic 
results of companies privatized by the coupon method were worse 
than before the 1989 revolution, he claimed.

  [Text] Bratislava, June 26 (CTK) -- The renewal of economic 
cooperation with Arab countries and expressing support for the 
Middle East peace process were the main goals of Slovak Foreign 
Minister Eduard Kukan's visit to Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, Kukan 
told journalists today. 
  Speaking upon his return to Bratislava Kukan said that his 
talks with Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, Syrian 
President Hafiz al-Asad and League of Arab States Secretary 
General were not just polite meetings. 
  He said that Slovakia maintained a good reputation in the 
Middle East and called for the renewal of the broken ties 
existing at the time of the Czechoslovak Federation. "Arab 
countries are interested in developing relations with Slovakia 
and they are just waiting for the political signal. It is now 
up to economic circles how they utilize this political capital," 
Kukan said. 
  Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi will sign an economic 
agreement in Egypt next week, said Kukan. He said that Slovakia 
was not trailing behind the Czech Republic although it still did 
not have a Slovak-Arab Chamber of Commerce similar to the 
Czech-Arab one. 
  Kukan said that with its largest trade partner, Syria, 
Slovakia could continue cooperation in the military area, the 
power industry, engineering and agriculture. Kukan pointed to a 
chance which is appearing for Slovak companies to cooperate with 
Egyptian and Jordanian partners in building infrastructure in 
Palestine. 
  Slovakia's trade turnover with Syria is about $48 million, 
with Egypt about $20 million, and with Jordan $7 million. 
  Asked by CTK Kukan elaborated that a contract on supplying 
250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria was close to implementation and 
he did not know about any other under preparation. However, he 
said that Slovakia was ready to participate in military 
cooperation, including the modernization of tanks, also with 
Egypt. 
  On the unblocking of Syria's debt towards the former 
Czechoslovakia which is worth billions of dollars Kukan said 
action had first to be coordinated with the Czech Republic. 
"However, the Syrian side is very reserved in this issue," he 
said. 
  Kukan stressed that Slovakia's efforts to improve 
cooperation 
with Arab states, from which it has no diplomatic relations only 
with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, does not mean a change in the 
balanced approach towards individual countries of this region 
and in Slovakia's interest in cooperation with Israel.

  [Text] Bratislava June 27 (CTK) -- It is in the interest of 
both Slovakia and the Czech Republic [CR] to quickly sign an 
agreement on dividing the claims that individual companies have 
towards Russia, Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova said today. 
  On Friday [24 June] she signed an agreement in Moscow about 
resolving the debts of the Russian Federation and the former 
Soviet Union. However, the issue of receivables of individual 
companies worth $385 million remained open. 
  The Slovak side disagrees with the fact that the agreement 
attributes $330 million to the Czech side, which includes the 
receivables of Slovak firms exporting through Czech foreign 
trade companies. 
  Jozef Trojak, state secretary of the Finance Ministry, 
pointed out that the agreement concerns around $1.6 billion from 
the $5- billion Soviet debt to the former Czechoslovakia. 
  This comprises $666 million from government loans and $115 
million in interest, $166 million arising from mutual 
accounting, $42 million and $16 million for technical loans, 
$345 million for participation in building a gas pipeline in 
Yamburg, Russia, and an iron ore complex in Krivoy Rog, Ukraine. 
Receivables to the value of $385 million will remain untouched 
until the Czechs and Slovaks agree on them. 
  Trojak said that, in contrast to government claims, company 
receivables are not to be divided in a 2:1 ratio (as the rest of 
the property of former Czechoslovakia) but "according to who 
produced the goods." 
  Nevertheless, it is proving extremely difficult to ascertain 
the exact amount of the receivables, and the help of foreign 
trade companies will be needed as well. Trojak estimated Slovak 
receivables at $166 million, of which a part has probably been 
paid, so he calculated the present debt at $140 million. 
  Schmognerova said that Russia will start paying back the 
first part of the Czechoslovak Government loan from November 
1989 (worth $666 million) as of January 1, 1996 and the 
remainder as of January 1, 1999. 
  She pointed out that the payments would be effected in 
various ways, including with supplies of goods or through a 
capitalisation of the debt. For instance, the interest compiled 
in 1993-94 has already been covered through imports of military 
technology to Slovakia. Trojak did not exclude the possibility 
that payment through these imports would continue. 
  Schmognerova also signed an agreement on the prevention of 
double taxation, and a trade agreement which acknowledges 
Slovakia's unfavorable balance in trade with Russia. 
  An agreement on long-term crude oil supplies was signed as 
well, in which Slovakia strives to ensure annual supplies of 5 
million tons of crude oil until 2003. An agreement on Russian 
supplies of nuclear fuel and the storage of spent nuclear fuel 
was signed, as well as on a credit of $150 million for the 
completion of the first two units of the nuclear power plant in 
Mochovce, West Slovakia.

  [Text] Bratislava June 27 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal 
Kovac said it may be possible to withdraw the disputed case of 
the Gabcikovo hydroelectric power project on the Danube from the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague. 
  If indeed a historical reconciliation has come about between 
Slovakia and Hungary, consideration could also then be given to 
whether it would be "more advantageous" and "wiser" to withdraw 
the case and resolve it together, Kovac told journalists in 
Bratislava today. 
  Slovakia accuses Hungary of violating its commitments in an 
international agreement concerning the project in 1977. Hungary 
accuses Slovakia of unilaterally deciding to divert the River 
Danube from its old course and of thereby causing great 
environmental damage. The case was taken to The Hague in May. 
  Kovac said he would test the possibility of a historical 
reconciliation on his visit to Budapest this autumn, on which he 
has been invited by Hungarian President Arpad Goncz. The two 
heads of state returned today from a visit to the United States 
during which they held talks with President Bill Clinton and 
received an award from the Institute for East-West Studies 
(IEWS) for their efforts in seeking a settlement between 
Slovakia and Hungary. 
  On his visit to Hungary Kovac hopes to hold talks not only 
with Goncz but also with members of the new Hungarian 
Government, he said. Maybe then questions like the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam could be de-politicised and settled more 
easily, he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: "Slovak Dam Project Remains a Source </F>
of International Tension"] 
  [Text] Water traffic along the Danube river, blocked for 
more than a month because of a malfunction at Slovakia's 
Gabcikovo dam, lurched back into motion April 27, clearing the 
way for hundreds of irate ship owners to complete their 
deliveries. 
  Caused by a mixture of bad luck, bad blood and bad planning, 
the breakdown of the dam's lock system has featured the 
suspected murder of a ship captain, insinuations of espionage 
and millions of dollars in damages claimed by shipping companies. 
  It also has fulfilled some of the worst predictions about 
the 
communist-era dam and hydroelectric project, which began 
operating in 1992. 
  "The impact is tremendous," said Karl Brewi, general 
director 
of the Vienna-based Austrian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG), 
which had 30 vessels delayed. Although Slovak dam officials say 
80 vessels were stuck in queues--51 upstream and 29 
downstream--shipping companies put the number in the hundreds as 
crews waited in Hungarian or Austrian ports for the go-ahead. 
  The most recent trouble at the controversial Gabcikovo 
hydroelectric plant--which has been the focus of a 
Hungarian-Slovak transborder dispute for years--began Feb. 11 
when a Ukrainian tugboat capsized in the dam's right lock. The 
captain was found hanged inside the half-submerged vessel. 
  Slovak police are suspicious of the apparent suicide. 
  "A ship has an accident and the captain thinks he must hang 
himself in the next couple of minutes?" said Miroslav Liska, 
spokesman for the Bratislava-based Water Development Authority 
(Vodohospodarska vystavba), which operates the dam. The captain, 
Liska pointed out, was nearing retirement and had just bought a 
car that he was bringing home to Ukraine. 
  "A Ukrainian who just bought a car would not hang himself," 
he said. "It shows that maybe he did not hang himself, but was 
hanged." 
  Slovak police may never learn the full story, because the 
Ukrainian crew left the scene shortly after the accident, when 
Ukraine insisted on removing the crippled vessel without Slovak 
participation. This operation took close to a month, while 
Ukrainian ships arrived and then removed the tug. "We wanted to 
remove it immediately," Liska said, "but we were too benevolent." 
  During this time, Gabcikovo's left lock slowly ferried the 
dam's regular 20 to 30 ships a day back and forth, although it 
had been scheduled to shut down Feb. 12 for a routine 
inspection, Liska said. On March 20, just over a month after the 
first accident, the left lock broke down, bringing all traffic 
to a halt. 
  Shipping companies were outraged to learn that Gabcikovo has 
no emergency gate--a standard feature of any lock system. Aside 
from criticism about the dam's effect on local farmland and 
water tables, this omission supported long-standing claims that 
the dam was poorly constructed. 
  Under the terms of the original Slovak-Hungarian agreement 
for constructing the cross-border waterworks, signed in 1979, 
Hungary was to build an emergency gate on its side. After 
Hungary unilaterally backed out of the agreement in 1992, a move 
Slovaks continue to call illegal, no emergency gate was built. 
One is under construction now on the Slovak side and should be 
completed by late 1995, according to Liska. 
  Though Slovak dam officials have no explanation for the 
breakdown of the left lock, diving teams claim to have found a 
cable that may have interfered with the lock's seal. Espionage 
is suspected. The final word is pending, however, while the left 
lock is fully drained and an investigation is completed. 
  River traffic started moving again April 27 after the right 
lock went back into operation and a Romanian ship passed through 
a test run at 11 a.m. The last of the ships stuck in the 
month-long queue was expected to pass through by the next day. 
  With delayed deliveries of steel, iron ore, agricultural 
products and liquid fuel, DDSG puts its damages at more than $3 
million. 
  "It is not correct to operate a lock system like Gabcikovo 
without these doors," DDSG's Brewi said. Brewi plans to seek 
damages from Gabcikovo and expects his Hungarian and Ukrainian 
counterparts to do the same. "They have suffered even higher 
losses than we have," he said. 
  One possibility may be to appeal through the technical 
section of the Danube Commission, which oversees operation along 
the river but has little authority to extract fines. Another 
possibility is taking the matter to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. 
  In either case, the shipping companies are ready for a 
fight. 
  Gabcikovo has already rejected a $6 million claim from 
Ukrainian shipping companies, Liska said. "I don't think anyone 
can claim damages [from road authorities] when a big crash 
happens on the highway and the traffic is delayed."

<F P=106> [Article by Wade Daniels: "Hold Your Tongue or Pay the </F>
Price"] 
  [Text] Bratislava--Slovak Deputy Premier Roman Kovac has 
asked Bratislava's police to investigate whether an accusation 
made against him by Vladimir Meciar, the former premier he 
helped oust, could be grounds for criminal charges. 
  Meciar's charge, first voiced at a May 4 rally attended by 
7,000 of his supporters, is that Kovac pocketed $5 million US 
earmarked for Slovakia by the U.S. government. That same 
evening, deputies of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia 
(HZDS), now in the opposition, made the same accusation against 
Kovac in Parliament, in a failed attempt to remove him from 
office. 
  Neither Meciar nor any of the HZDS parliamentarians have 
revealed how or from where the funds might have been diverted. 
  Kovac, vice chair of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU), 
is one of many disgruntled former HZDS members sitting in the 
new government which ousted Meciar and his allies in March. 
  After hearing the accusations in Parliament, Kovac said he 
wanted Meciar to make his claims in public, to Kovac's face, so 
he could defend himself. 
  A few days later Kovac got his wish, when both men were 
invited to the Sunday afternoon political television talk show 
"Kroky" ("Steps"). 
  Meciar at one point turned to Kovac and said, "I'm giving 
you 
a chance and telling you out in the open and in front of the 
television: You confessed publicly that you accepted $5 million, 
which you have at your disposal. There were plenty of witnesses." 
  "It's not true..." 
  "Talk about it. Prove it." 
  "I will," Kovac replied, and added that he would take Meciar 
to court. 
  If what Meciar said were anywhere near the truth, Roman 
Kovac 
would be one of the richest men in Slovakia. But Meciar didn't 
stop at the $5 million US--already a preposterously large sum of 
money (for either the Slovak or the U.S. government) to go 
unnoticed and unaccounted for. 
  He went on to claim that last year, as deputy premier, Kovac 
had accepted a bribe of 450 million Austrian schillings from the 
German firm Siemens. This was apparently a reference to 
Slovakia's purchase of medical equipment from Siemens--a deal 
that many in Meciar's administration participated in and found 
no reason to fault at the time. 
  Siemens officials are calling the accusations entirely 
false, 
and have protested what they say are attempts to entangle their 
company in political controversies. The officials said they were 
considering taking "legal steps" against anyone "who insists on 
this false statement." 
  Kovac has made no mention of this accusation in his call for 
an investigation, asking police to look into the possibility 
that Meciar's claim about the $5 million US constituted an 
attack on a state executive (section 156 of the criminal code) 
and the crime of slander (section 206). 
  The May 4 effort to remove Kovac and the accusations levied 
against him are widely seen here as part of a campaign to 
tarnish the image and credibility of the new government going 
into the nationwide elections, scheduled for late September. 
  Deputies of the new ruling coalition are now gearing up for 
further attacks from the feisty Meciar. And meanwhile, with his 
own party comfortably ahead in the polls, the head of HZDS seems 
none too worried about the talk of legal action against him. 
  Actually, Meciar seems to relish the role of incorrigible 
demagogue. On May 13, as a guest on Bratislava's Radio Twist 
talk show, he quipped that moderators of political television 
shows ought to vote for him too, since without him, they would 
have no material for their shows and find themselves jobless.

<F P=106> [Article by Michele Kayal: "Slovakia Tries To Repackage </F>
Itself To Impress International Investors"] 
  [Text] Caught in a tense game of political beat-the-clock, 
Slovakia's new leaders are jetting around the world, pitching 
the country to business people, and juggling laws to line up as 
many foreign investors as possible before September's elections. 
  The new government, which took power in mid-March after a 
vote of no-confidence toppled former Prime Minister Vladimir 
Meciar, has made attracting foreign investment one of its main 
goals. Success here could mean success at the polls and, 
ultimately, success for Slovakia's ailing economy. 
  "The long-term goal is to bring our factories up to world 
standards, to make our products more acceptable," said Fred 
Nicholson, adviser to Slovakia's privatization minister. "And 
without foreign investment, it would be very hard to get our 
economy going." 
  Leaders admit that they can only begin the economic 
turnaround process before facing the possibility of being voted 
out of office in the fall. But they hope that they can make some 
permanent changes in the country's economic profile. 
  Spearheading a worldwide whistle-stop campaign by Slovak 
politicians, Prime Minister Josef Moravcik told the National 
Council of French Employers in Paris last week that his country 
was safe territory for Western investors. Moravcik's economics 
minister, Peter Magvasi, traveled with him and put out the word 
that more than half of the Slovak companies to be privatized in 
the next round are earmarked for foreign investors. 
  On the same day, Slovak President Michal Kovac praised his 
country's 1993 economic results to an Austrian business group in 
Vienna and promised investors substantial tax breaks. At the end 
of May, he will make the same pitch in Switzerland, but there he 
will add "more concrete details" about how investors can get 
involved, said presidential spokeswoman Anna Turenicova. In 
June, Kovac will cross the Atlantic with a message for American 
business. 
  Slovakia has long been the orphan child of the Visegrad 
nations. Of the $8.8 billion in foreign direct investment 
received by Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
since 1989, only $366 million--or 4 percent of the total--has 
found its way to Bratislava. The country offers the cheapest 
labor force in the region, but its political instability and the 
Meciar government's hostile attitude toward privatization has 
scared off many would-be business partners. 
  Roughly 300 enterprises worth 220 billion SK ($7.7 billion) 
will be privatized in the next round, privatization adviser 
Nicholson said. About 80 billion SK ($2.8 billion) worth of 
shares have been set aside for coupon privatization, and the 
remainder will be for sale. 
  "Foreigners are more than welcome," Nicholson said. 
  Nearly three-quarters of the companies being considered are 
heavy industrial concerns, such as steel mills, chemical plants, 
rubber manufacturers and the entire Slovak electric company. 
Nicholson said sales could begin as early as June. Only about 15 
percent of the Slovak economy is currently in private hands, and 
Nicholson said the goal is to unload 60 percent by the end of 
this round. 
  The Slovak National Agency for Foreign Investment and 
Development, an investor liaison organization, is blanketing 
embassies and governments around the world with promotional 
materials. Politicians are drafting laws to eliminate double 
taxation and offer extensive tax breaks. Legislation protecting 
investments already has been prepared and should be debated in 
parliament's next session. 
  Brigita Schmognerova, deputy prime minister for economic 
affairs, currently is in the process of trying to streamline the 
bureaucracy by cutting back on the number of hoops investors 
must jump through and by locating all the responsible people in 
a single office. 
  "We're trying to make it easier," she confirmed. 
  Schmognerova said the strategy also includes landing the 
support of international financial institutions, such as the 
International Finance Corp. and the International Monetary Fund. 
Slovakia and the IMF are in the final stages of negotiating a 
"standby loan," an expression of the fund's confidence in the 
country's economy. Schmognerova has also been lobbying business 
people from other countries, inviting them to visit before the 
elections. 
  The government's aggressive methods are already showing some 
success. A mission from the American Overseas Private Investment 
Corp. will arrive in mid-June, and another American delegation 
is expected in July, Schmognerova said. 
  The number of tenders from abroad for Slovak companies has 
risen considerably over the last two months, according to 
several privatization and economics officials. And Nicholson 
said he receives five or six inquiries from foreign investors 
every day. "The ministry is trying to come forward to these 
people, which didn't happen before," he said. "The word is out 
that we want to do this." 
  Nicholson said he estimates that nearly half of the 
inquiries 
have come from Americans. Sweden, Germany and Austria have also 
figured prominently, and Nicholson said he expects more interest 
from the French after Moravcik's visit. 
  But financial consultants say that while the changes are 
encouraging, most investors are moving with caution. "The 
presence of the elections really means everyone is adopting a 
wait-and-see attitude," said Geoff Upton, a partner at Price 
Waterhouse in Prague. "If [the new government's] campaign 
requires specific investments before the elections, they may be 
disappointed." 
  Schmognerova said she and her colleagues feel that the work 
they are doing now will pay off, with or without a victory at 
the polls. "We really do have a long-term interest in developing 
the country," she said. "Even if [the current government falls 
in September], some of the investors will decide to come anyway."

<F P=106> ["Law on Census -- Discriminating and Tendentious for the </F>
Albanians -- Albanian Deputy to the Macedonian Parliament Hysen 
Shaqiri States" -- ATA headline] 
  [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- The Law on the Census is 
discriminating and tendentious for the Albanians, the Albanian 
deputy to the Macedonian Parliament, Hysen Shaqiri, the only 
deputy who voted against the Law on the Census in The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM], said in his interview 
with ATA. 
  At the moment this law was voted, he said, more than 60 per 
cent of the Albanian population have not been able to obtain the 
nationality document. Also, sanctioning by law the division in 
resident and non-resident categories is another aggravating 
factor for the Albanians, as it is known that a very great 
number of them are found today in various countries of the world. 
  The motives for the census are political, the Albanian 
deputy 
says stressing that "The manipulation to reduce in the maximum 
and artificially the number of the Albanian population and the 
tendency to prove the absurd Slav thesis about the 
`non-autochthony of the Albanians in the territories on which 
they are residing today,' are manifested in the classification 
in citizens with nationality and without nationality." 
  Albanian deputies voted for the Law on the Census under the 
pressure of the Macedonian state power and under the illusion 
created by the official propaganda about seriousness and 
fairness of the census, Mr. Shaqiri says. 
  But, one day before the beginning of the census, they asked 
for the postponement of the schedule and change of the law 
because of the Albanians' reaction to unfairness in the law and 
preparatory procedures for the beginning of the census. 
  "If we enrol now, the consequences will be catastrophic for 
us," he said adding that: "We must not give up persistence for 
the completion of the necessary documents, despite numerous 
obstacles created by the state administration, and participate 
in the census at a proper time." 
  "It is not us, the Albanians, that have boycotted the 
census, 
but it is the law itself and the unilateral application of its 
preparatory procedures that have boycotted us," the Albanian 
deputy says, stressing that he, himself, although a deputy of 
the parliament of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, has 
not been able to obtain the nationality document.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ex-Yugoslavia/Italy: Martino in </F>
Belgrade"] 
  [Excerpts] (ANSA) Belgrade, June 28 -- Italian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Martino arrived in Belgrade today, greeted by 
the head of diplomacy for the Yugoslav Federation (Serbia and 
Montenegro) Vladislav Jovanovic. 
  With Jovanovic, Martino immediately went to meet the 
president of the Serb Republic, Slobodan Milosevic. On the 
calendar were talks with the Serb Bosnian leadership and in 
particular with Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha. 
  Martino arrived here from Zagreb, the second stop of his 
peace mission to the former Yugoslavia which kicked off in 
Sarajevo Monday [27 June]. 
  In the Bosnian capital, the Italian diplomatic chief met 
with 
Premier Haris Silajdzic, while in the Croatian capital he 
conferred with President of the Republic, Franjo Tudjman. 
  The Serbian press was playing up the Martino mission and the 
influential BORBA newspaper spoke of "Decisive Hours for Peace", 
while the broad circulation POLITIKA today said on its front 
page that it would be the upcoming G-7 summit to give new 
impetus to peace and the paper underscored the optimism exuded 
by the Italian foreign minister. 
  Martino is touring the Bosnian crisis area in preparation 
for 
the G-7 summit in Naples on July 8-10 at which Russia, seen as a 
major player in attempts to solve the crisis, will be included 
in the political part of the discussions. 
  Furthermore, reliable diplomatic sources in Belgrade said 
today that Vitaliy Churkin, the special representative of 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin for the handling of affairs in 
the former Yugoslavia, would be arriving here on Wednesday [28 
June]. [passage omitted] 
  In addition to Churkin, there were rumors that a special 
envoy from United States President Bill Clinton would also be 
arriving here Wednesday. 
  Charles Redman, handling matters pertaining to the former 
Yugoslavia for the Clinton administration, and Churkin, might 
well present to the Serbian and Bosnian Serbian leadership the 
conclusions to be reached today in Paris by the Contact Group, 
experts from the United States, Russia and the European Union, 
represented by France, Germany and Britain. These conclusions 
will have to do with the partition of Bosnia and with steps to 
be taken against any side which eventually does not accept this 
plan. 
  It is taken for granted that Redman at least, and possibly 
Churkin too, will continue the present mission by also going to 
Sarajevo and Zagreb.

  [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- ATA correspondent in 
Prishtina Behlul Jashari reports that on the fourth day of the 
trial against 14 Albanians, the Serbian Court of the Prishtina 
circle heard five other defendants, who did not accept the 
charges brought against them. They said that the indictments 
are full of slanders stressing that they had been maltreated 
during investigation. The defendants described the grave 
tortures they had suffered by inspectors of the Serbian State 
Security, such as the use of electric shock or violent drinking 
of chemical substances. 
  The head of the jury, Dragolub Zdravkovic, admitted 
cynically 
but unwillingly a truth: "According to declarations by the 
defendants who described the tortures against them by the 
security, it comes out that not they but those who have caused 
this violence should be held responsible. It seems to me that 
this process is not an ordinary one." 
  Defence attorneys of the defendants approved completely 
Zdravkovic's statement, stressing that their clients are telling 
the truth in the court.

  [Text] Prishtina, June 27 (ATA) -- The interrogation of 14 
Albanians accused of allegedly forming the Ministry of Defence 
of the Republic of Kosova ended after eight sittings in the 
Prishtina Court. In the last sittings, all the accused rejected 
as a whole the indictment brought against them. They explained 
in detail that they were severely treated by the State Security, 
saying that the accusation was based on slanders and statements 
made in the Investigation Office under pressure. 
  The other sitting of this framed trial will be held on June 
27 with the interrogation of the witnesses.

  [Text] Tirana, June 24 (ATA) -- President Berisha 
confirmed once more the determination of Albania to set a good 
example of the freedoms and rights of the minorities according 
to the document of Copenhagen in the meeting he had with the 
CSCE high commissioner for the national minorities today. He 
also said that Mr. Stoel's visit to Albania serves to prove how 
far from the truth have been and are the statements of those who 
seek to cause splits between the minority and the Albanians who 
are living and will live together in full harmony wherever they 
are. Relations between the minority and the Albanians have been 
and will be very good. They will not be affected or changed by 
manipulations. 
  Mr. Van der Stoel appreciated the complete transparency of 
the Albanian party and expressed his thanks for the great 
possibilities offered to him to see the reality in Albania about 
which he will report.

  [Text] Tirana, June 28 (ATA) -- The achievement of a rapid 
economic growth constitutes our greatest trial, it is a historic 
challenge that we must win, President Berisha said yesterday at 
the National Council of the Democratic Party in Tirana. Mr. 
Berisha said that the achievement of a rapid economic growth 
will also assure to make up for the lost valuable time. 
  Referring to an IMF information last February which ranked 
Albania the first in Europe for the rapid economic growth of 
about 10 percent, Mr. Berisha said that realization of these 
short term rapid rates marks a great achievement for Albania and 
that a long term, not short term, guarantee of these high norms 
and rates will be Archimedean Screw for its integration into the 
bosom of the developed countries of Europe. 
  Although the Albanian economy will continue for many years 
to 
have a real income and consumption per capita among the lowest 
one in Europe, an open economic policy based on freedom would 
help maintain an economic growth of 8-10 percent per annum and 
for a long -term period, President Berisha said, basing the 
rapid economic growth on the intellectual potential, 
geographical position, natural resources and a favourable market 
of labour power at home.

  In its newscast tonight national television aired a report 
on 
the incident from Sofia Airport. Three French and German sports 
planes landed at Sofia Airport yesterday [23 June] noon on their 
way back from an exposition in Turkey, it said. The traffic 
controller on duty would not be videotaped. The TV reporter 
learnt from another controller the planes had asked permission 
but the request had arrived late for technical reasons. An 
investigation is underway; this is the reason behind traffic 
controllers' unwillingness to be shown on TV.

  [Text] Pernik, June 26 (BTA) -- Considering the conditions 
and the way in which the census in Macedonia [The Former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] is being conducted, the 
lack of normal conditions for the expression of ethnic identity, 
the curtailment of freedom of speech and the expression of 
personal views and critical statements, considering certain 
facts of police coercion, and the open anti-Bulgarian campaign 
waged by the government-controlled media, I cannot accept the 
results of the census as objective and accurate, Nikolay 
Slatinski MP, chairman of Parliament's National Security 
Committee, told BTA. 
  He said he expressed his personal view. The official 
government position is delayed, obscure and inadequate, 
according to him. According to him, the policy pursued by the 
Macedonian authorities, of putting obstacles to normal 
good-neighbourly relations, could lead to a review of the 
Bulgarian position, and a firmer Bulgarian stand on Macedonia.

  [Text] Sofia, June 28 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben Berov 
received today Greek Public Order Minister Stilianos-Angelos 
Papathemelis, who is paying an official visit here at the 
invitation of the Ministry of the Interior. Papathemelis 
delivered Berov the most cordial greetings of Greek Prime 
Minister Andreas Papandreou and an invitation to visit Athens. 
  The two sides discussed possibilities for cooperation 
between 
the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior and the Greek Ministry of 
Public Order in combatting drug trafficking and illegal crossing 
of the border between the two countries. They expressed 
satisfaction over the presence of representatives of Greek 
business in Bulgaria. We also talked about peace and stability 
in the Balkans, said the Greek minister at the press conference 
after the meeting. He said that the opinion of the two sides on 
these issue coincided to a great extent. 
  We believe the interference of non-Balkan factors in the 
crisis in the former Yugoslavia to be greatly disturbing and of 
a negative impact on the solution of the problems, Papathemelis 
said in response to a question. However, we hope that the worst 
will be avoided, he said. The launching of the idea about a 
Macedonian nation and a Macedonian language is an instrument for 
destabilizing the region, the Greek minister said. According to 
him, Skopje cannot use this instrument on its own but it could 
be used by third, non-Balkan states which may disturb peace in 
the Balkans. We would like to believe, Papathemelis said, that 
the government of this state will realize where its true 
interests lie. I believe that Mr. Kiro Gligorov holds the key 
to the successful solution of this problem. 
  At the talks in the Ministry of the Interior, the Greek side 
invited Bulgarian Interior Minister Mikhaylov and a group of 
experts to visit Greece and discuss measures in combatting drug 
trafficking and strengthening border control, Chief Interior 
Ministry Secretary Kosta Bogatsevski told the press conference.

<F P=106> [Report by Iva Toncheva and Andrey Sharkov] </F>
  [Text] Sofia, June 28 (BTA) -- The leadership of the two 
major parliamentary forces -- the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
(BSP) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) -- discussed the 
current political situation at their regular sessions today. 
Later on their leaders spoke before journalists of possible 
early elections. 
  The SDS has been insisting on early general elections for 
almost 18 months. The Socialists declared themselves for early 
parliamentary elections at their latest congress. 
Representatives of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and 
Freedoms (DPS), on the mandate of which the incumbent cabinet 
was formed, have also mentioned early elections this autumn. 
However, these elections have not been scheduled yet. On June 
26 President Zhelyu Zhelev repeated his proposal to the 
political forces to reach an agreement on the date of the 
elections, which according to him, should be held this autumn. 
Prime Minister Lyuben Berov has also proposed an agreement 
between the political forces on early elections. The idea for 
an agreement between the political forces on the holding of 
elections was also launched last Sunday in an interview with BSP 
deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov. 
  Before the elections it is necessary to tackle urgent tasks 
such as the launching of mass privatization, completion of the 
work of the liquidation councils (liquidating the former 
cooperative farms and returning the land to its former owners), 
normalization of Bulgaria's international finance and economic 
positions and guaranteeing this country's internal and external 
security, BSP leader Zhan Videnov said today. We should also 
decide on the withdrawal of the government and the giving up of 
the mandates of the parliamentary forces to form a new cabinet 
within this parliament, which would be obligatory for the 
faction of the Socialists too. It is also necessary to prepare 
the elections from a purely legal point of view -- amendments to 
the constitution if necessary, amendments to the electoral law 
and the laws on local government, Videnov said. 
  According to SDS leader Filip Dimitrov, there are 
considerable differences between the stand of the SDS and the 
other political forces on the issue of early parliamentary 
elections. "Last Tuesday the SDS committed itself to early 
elections as a political force," Dimitrov stressed. According 
to him, it is not enough for leaders, including Socialists, to 
express their personal views in favour of early elections. The 
decision of the supreme SDS leadership of last Tuesday entails 
commitments which should be undertaken by all political forces 
insisting on early elections. According to the SDS, the 
political forces should commit themselves to no-confidence in 
the cabinet of Lyuben Berov, to giving up their mandate for 
forming a new cabinet within the framework of the incumbent 
parliament and to opposing any attempts to form such a cabinet. 
  The leadership of the SDS and the DPS or part of them are 
insincere in their call for early parliamentary elections, BSP 
leader Zhan Videnov said today. By way of illustration he cited 
the draft of Prime Minister Berov of a framework agreement 
between the political forces providing for elections in the 
autumn of 1994, which according to him was spoilt by the DPS, 
and the preconditions and tactical schemes leading to elections 
set by SDS leaders during the negotiations held with the SDS 
last week at the request of the BSP. The BSP is seeking 
prospects for a left-of-centre agreement on pre-elections and 
post-elections actions, Videnov recalled. 
  An official agreement between parliamentary and 
extraparliamentary forces on early elections and the accession 
to this agreement of state institutions would confirm the 
attitude of the different political formations on early 
elections this autumn, BSP deputy leader Yanaki Stoilov said at 
today's press conference. "I believe that such a proposal would 
help us verify the sincerity of all who have shown an attitude 
to early elections," he said. In an interview for today's issue 
of DEMOKRATSIYA SDS leader Filip Dimitrov says that what matters 
is not the word agreement but party commitment. "I have learnt 
from experience that an agreement may be full of traps, such as 
for example certain laws which will have to be passed," Dimitrov 
said.

<F P=106> [From the 29 June Press Review] </F>
  [Excerpt] Sofia, June 29 (BTA) -- The press comments on 
the debt reduction agreement with the London Club of creditor 
banks amounting to $8,100 million which is to be signed at the 
Boyana State Residence today. "When the deal is finalized, 
Bulgaria's debt will be 47 percent less," the financial news 
paper PARI says. There was a scandal on meeting the foreign 
bank officials at the airport yesterday, the paper writes 
reporting that journalists were not allowed to speak to the 
bankers. 
  In a year and a half after the government of the Union of 
Democratic Forces (SDS) was ousted, another $900 million have 
been added to Bulgaria's debt to the creditor banks as a result 
of the accrual of unpaid interest on it, the SDS paper 
DEMOKRATSIYA notes. According to DEMOKRATSIYA, the cabinet of 
SDS leader Filip Dimitrov was likely to achieve much better 
conditions for the debt deal. 
  Several Russian banks abroad have not sent their offers for 
the debt deal, opting for a settlement of Bulgaria's 
indebtedness to them outside the London Club, OTECHESTVEN 
VESTNIK was told by Mr. Peter Tils, Executive Director of 
Deutsche Bank AG and chairman of the London Club Bank Advisory 
Committee. Deutsche Bank will act as an agent for the deal 
until the end of July. 
  Experts of the Deutsche Bank central office in Frankfurt 
have 
warned that some years later, when it will have to make debt 
settlement payments of over $1,000 million, Bulgaria may find 
itself insolvent, ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME says. 
  The finalization of the ideal is forthcoming and only time 
will show if it is good, DUMA writes citing Mr. Mileti Mladenov, 
vice governor of the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB). It is 
better to conclude the deal now, because the risk of not signing 
it is worse than its disadvantages, BNB Governor Todor Vulchev 
is cited as saying yesterday. Prof. Vulchev warned that if 
Bulgaria suspends the debt service payments, the creditor banks 
can deduct them from its assets abroad. 
  All the political forces should support the deal, Prof. 
Vulchev told the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights 
and Freedoms (DPS) at yesterday's [28 June] meeting which 
NOVINAR reports on. 
  The fact that the electorate is in the dark about the debt 
deal should sober up the country's administrators, 24 CHASA 
notes commenting on the results of a poll conducted in Sofia. 
The debt has been accrued in secret (at the time of the 
totalitarian regime), but it cannot be paid off in the dark, the 
paper notes. Bulgarians should know they will have to suffer 
privation and they should know what for, 24 CHASA goes on to 
say. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Hana Lesenarova: "Klaus Slammed for Changing </F>
Law"] 
  [Text] Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus came under sharp 
criticism in early May for submitting a bill to Parliament that 
was allegedly different from the one the full Cabinet had 
approved. 
  Josef Jezek, an independent member of Parliament who quit 
Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS) in March, accused Klaus May 
12 of making his own amendments to a bill on Senate and 
Parliament elections and then submitting it to Parliament as the 
officially recommended government version. 
  Since the split of Czechoslovakia Jan. 1, 1993, the Czech 
Republic has been operating with a unicameral legislature. The 
current Chamber of Deputies is the descendant of the Czech 
National Council, which served as the legislative body of the 
Czech Republic in the Czechoslovak federation. The bill now 
under dispute would establish the Senate as the country's new 
upper house. 
  According to Jezek, the version of the bill presented to 
Parliament differed from the government-approved one in the 
sizes and borders of the districts it set for elections to the 
Senate. "Someone has fundamentally changed the demarcation of 
the 81 electoral districts," he told RUDE PRAVO. 
  Vladimir Koronthaly, a deputy for the coalition Christian 
Democratic Party (KDS), laid the blame on Ministry of Interior 
officials who re-drafted the bill. Their version amounts to a 
substantive addition, made without the government's approval, he 
said, and therefore cannot be considered the official proposal. 
"And the next question is the responsibility of the person who 
signed it, and that is Premier Klaus," Koronthaly told MLADA 
FRONTA DNES. 
  According to press reports, the talk in the corridors of 
Parliament was more pointed: Many suspected that the changes to 
the districts reflected ODS interests, as the slight changes in 
boundaries and district sizes cleverly manipulated areas of ODS 
strength and weakness in order to bolster the party's election 
chances. 
  Klaus rejected all of the accusations, calling the 
controversy "useless hysteria." 
  "You know well enough it is nonsense. Nothing of the sort 
happened. It's an invention of deputy Jezek," Klaus told 
journalists. 
  ODS has been arguing with its coalition partners about the 
Senate elections for several months. While ODS demands that 
there be 81 electoral districts in the upcoming fall Senate 
elections, with one senator from each district, the other three 
parties in the ruling coalition--the KDS, the Christian 
Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the 
Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA)--want instead 27 districts, each 
with three senators. 
  The three smaller parties worry that if only one senator 
were 
elected from each electoral district, the outcome would be a 
Senate dominated by one party. And the ODS, as the party with 
the highest voter support (although its popularity has dropped 
from 32 percent of voters to 26 percent, according to a mid-May 
poll), stands to win a vast majority of the winner-take-all 
races provided for by its version of the Senate election law. 
  Klaus, meanwhile, has threatened that unless the ODS gets 
its 
way on the number of electoral districts, it will oppose the 
formation of the Senate. 
  On March 7, the Cabinet finally agreed to support the ODS 
version of the bill, and the Ministry of the Interior was 
charged with making the final adjustments agreed on by the 
government. 
  According to Klaus, "A couple of officials from the Interior 
Ministry redrew the maps...according to the consensus demand of 
the government." The Cabinet had agreed to "redo the maps to 
follow the current [administrative] district borders," he 
explained. 
  Klaus said he did not consider the change substantial enough 
to warrant the charge that the bill submitted to Parliament was 
a different version than the one agreed on by the Cabinet. He 
added that the disputes about the validity of the bill had 
"exceeded all limits, and my patience has really reached its 
end." 
  According to Jezek, however, the government-approved version 
of the legislation stipulated that the number of voters could 
not differ from one electoral district to the next by more than 
15 percent, whereas the version submitted by Klaus and Interior 
Minister Jan Ruml allows a difference of as much as 27 percent. 
  In one instance, press reports said, the actual difference 
between two districts could be as great as 34 percent. And that, 
Jezek argued, would disturb the balance of votes. 
  ODA's Radim Spacek agreed, saying the bill's lists of the 
administrative districts comprising each electoral district 
wiped from the map five administrative districts: 
Praha-Zbraslav, Praha-Troja, Brno-Komin, Brno-Jundrov, and the 
former military region of Libava. If the bill were signed as is, 
he said, voters in those districts would not be able to cast 
ballots. 
  Igor Nemec (ODS), director of the Office of the Government, 
described the dispute as a "misunderstanding." But he confirmed 
to Parliament that "The government neither discussed nor voted 
on the change [in the allowed difference in number of voters 
between districts] and therefore it was not recorded in the 
minutes," RUDE PRAVO reported. 
  "[But] not all changes are always in the government's 
decision," Nemec told the daily. 
  Nemec said two options were considered in the Cabinet's 
discussion of criteria for creating the electoral districts: 
Either they could correspond strictly to population, or they 
could follow the borders of current administrative districts. 
  The government opted for the second, thus requiring a change 
in the maximum permissible difference between electoral district 
populations, according to Nemec. 
  Representatives of the four coalition parties agreed at a 
May 
20 meeting that the bills were different, and laid the blame on 
Interior Ministry officials. But they said there was no need to 
search out a guilty party. 
  Meanwhile, the bill is moving through Parliament's 
committees, leaving a trail of bitter disputes in its wake. The 
Constitutional Committee, for instance, supported an ODA 
proposal for 27 three-senator districts, a fundamental break 
with the Cabinet's recommendation. 
  The full Chamber of Deputies is expected to vote on the bill 
during its next session, which starts May 31.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Egon T. Lansky, journalist and political </F>
analyst who served as Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman 
and ambassador to the Council of Europe: "Understanding Our Own 
Past, Forming Our Own Future"] 
  [Text] In the Czech press in mid-May I challenged the 
stance of President Havel, who before a gathering of politicians 
and intellectuals from home and abroad claimed that the Czech 
state, and indeed all post-Communist states, were not 
post-Communist anymore but full-fledged democracies like any 
others. 
  My arguments were based mostly on our shortcomings regarding 
rule of law, respect for the constitution, and suspected 
economic crime, often in the upper echelons of political power. 
  The events surrounding May's annual congress of Sudeten 
Germans (an ethnic group forcibly transferred from parts of 
Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia shortly after World War II), along 
with a few other international events, serve to remind us that 
the problem has a foreign policy dimension as well. A democracy, 
I believe, should be able to come to terms even with the nastier 
parts of its own past. 
  The Sudeten German question is loaded with emotion on both 
sides of the border. Sudeten Germans in the latter half of the 
1930s massively supported Hitler, and demanded to join his 
Reich, which they achieved through the Munich Agreement of 
September 1938. That date marked the beginning of the end of 
pre-war Czechoslovakia and, ultimately, of preparations for the 
war. 
  The suffering this brought to millions of Czechs, Slovaks 
and 
Jews in this country has been neither forgotten nor compensated. 
Czech victims of Nazism say they never received any reparations 
for their suffering and loss of property. Sudeten Germans, too, 
are demanding compensation and their right to a homeland, in 
other words, the right to return to what is today the Czech 
Republic. 
  Although the government of federal Czechoslovakia tried to 
reject material claims from the German side (while raising some 
claims on behalf of Czech victims of Nazi persecution), it did 
admit moral wrongdoing in punishing the Sudeten Germans 
collectively. 
  Current Czech officials, on the other hand, have been making 
various noises about dialogue on an unspecified level (as 
Premier Klaus suggested last year). And recently, in a rare 
display of unity across the entire political spectrum, they flat 
out rejected invitations to engage in dialogue made by the 
Sudeten German spokesman, Mr. Neubauer. Mr. Klaus even called an 
invitation to attend the Sudeten German congress a provocation. 
  Further underscoring the delicacy of the situation is the 
fact that the guest of honor at that congress--to be presented 
with the highest Sudeten German honor, the Charles Prize--was 
Alois Mock, the foreign minister of neighboring Austria, whose 
official speech was published in advance in the SUDETENDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG, a rather unimportant and militant German weekly. 
  Mr. Mock chose to speak of the suffering Sudeten Germans 
experienced as a result of the forcible transfer, while ignoring 
the suffering of Czechoslovak citizens under Hitler's 
Germany--which indeed is not a very wise or tactful policy from 
the foreign minister of a neighboring state. On top of it all, 
he had the bad taste to quote Mr. Havel, who once equated the 
transfer of Sudeten Germans after the war with "ethnic 
cleansing" and was subjected to heavy criticism for it. 
  Poor Mr. Mock was criticized not only in Prague, but also at 
home. Some Social Democrats in Austria even suggested that he 
had confused the SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG with the SUDDEUTSCHE 
ZEITUNG and the Sudeten German Charles Prize with the European 
prize of the same name, and they asked him to reconsider his 
decision to accept the award. 
  So much for Mr. Mock. As for the Czechs, their irrational 
attitude toward a less pleasant part of their own past clearly 
shows that their thinking is far from free of totalitarian 
influence. They simply cannot escape dialogue with an ethnic 
group in the country of their mightiest neighbor, which, even 
though it may not be very influential politically, is still big 
enough to be able to bring the problem back every time it is 
most uncomfortable for the Czechs. It will always be a matter of 
Czech foreign policy as long as the Czechs themselves are not 
able to form a rational attitude of their own to present to 
their German neighbors. 
  The legacy of Czech-German relations is inescapable. If the 
Czechs believe the demands of their counterparts (and the 
Sudeten Germans are counterparts, like it or not) are arrogant 
and/or wrong, it should be easy to refute them. But this issue 
has a moral dimension that must be addressed too, a dimension 
that is very much concerned with democracy and tolerance. As a 
victim of the Holocaust myself, and knowing well the entire 
complicated nature of own own German history, I cannot see any 
justice being done by causing summary injustice to others. 
  By accepting the European code of human rights, we have 
signed away the notion of collective guilt. We can still be 
members of international democratic institutions without 
practicing what we have signed, but in that case we won't be 
true democrats. 
  Ultimately, this is not even a Czech-German problem, but a 
purely Czech problem to be disposed of, and the sooner the 
better. This is a Czech-Czech problem in the sense that it is 
the duty of Czech politicians to introduce it and explain it to 
citizens. But as long as the premier takes invitations to be 
provocations, the efforts of people to turn their totalitarian 
minds to democracy will be futile.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Gomez: "Leftist Fever Unlikely To Jump </F>
Czech Border"] 
  [Text] As voters across the former East bloc turn away from 
market-oriented "shock therapists" and back toward socially 
oriented parties stocked with former communists, the Czech 
Republic has become a lonely island of European liberalism. 
  The recent election victories of socialist parties in Poland 
and Hungary have made the right-leaning government of Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus a unique feature in Central and Eastern 
Europe. 
  And unlike its neighbors, the current Czech coalition 
government shows no sign of losing ground in popularity polls; 
month after month, it continues to garner approval ratings of 
more than 60 percent. 
  By contrast, the Czechs don't seem interested enough in 
their 
own socialists to give them real power. The Czech Social 
Democratic Party (CSSD) surged in the polls last year but has 
since remained stagnant at about 15 percent, while the communist 
Left Bloc coalition still hovers at less than 10 percent in the 
polls. 
  This phenomenon has created a stir among academicians and 
political students of the post-communist region. In the first 
few years after the dramatic collapse of the Soviet bloc in 
1989, many analysts predicted it would not be long before voters 
in the region turned away from radical market reformers. 
  In his book Democracy and the Market, Adam 
Przeworski mapped out a start-stop-start cycle for free-market 
reforms in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 
  Voters, he predicted, would tend to protect themselves from 
disruptive market reforms and would turn back toward social 
democratic parties in order to hold onto some level of social 
security. Later, when the reforms have been slowed to a 
standstill, Przeworski wrote, the voters might give the liberal 
market-oriented parties another chance. 
  In Hungary and Poland, where inflation raged and 
unemployment 
jumped to more than 10 percent after 1989, the theory seems to 
fit so far. 
  But the Czech Republic has confounded most predictions. The 
economy is progressing smoothly and enjoys low inflation, the 
lowest level of unemployment in Europe and a zero-deficit state 
budget. And in contrast to its neighbors, the transformation 
process has occurred in relative tranquillity, undisturbed by 
strikes or social unrest. 
  Mitchell Orenstein of the Institute for EastWest Studies 
credits the first post-communist Czechoslovak government, as 
well as Klaus' government, for maintaining a controlled reform 
process between rapid market transformation and government 
intervention in the economy. 
  Although he couches his policies in rhetoric about rigorous 
pro-market reforms, Klaus has actually instigated a far more 
controlled version of reform than other post-communist 
governments. 
  "Basically, he is dismantling the control of the state in a 
controlled way," said Orenstein. "It's a state-controlled 
development of the private sector." 
  This style of governance is so different from the typical 
liberal governments of the West that Orenstein has given it its 
own--ism: "statist liberalism." 
  Evidence of this different approach lies everywhere in the 
Czech government's policies. The government has encouraged a 
rapid transfer of property from state to private hands, but 
still maintains an interventionist policy in other areas. 

  -  A policy of wage restraint has kept companies from raising 
their employees' salaries too high--a move that most observers 
say would cause a rise in inflation and unemployment. 
  -  Rent 
controls, which allow people to keep apartments for just 
hundreds of crowns per month, have been maintained. 
  -  Billions of 
crowns have been invested in district labor offices, helping to 
find work for more than 100,000 people in 1992-93. 
  -  Large 
state-owned enterprises have been subsidized with privatization 
receipts and bank loans to prevent early bankruptcies. 

  The central aim of these policies have been to prevent a 
jump 
in unemployment and inflation rates, which can kill any 
democratic government anywhere. 
  So far, these policies have worked remarkably well to 
maintain the government's popularity in the polls. But many 
observers warn that the Czechs may simply be delaying the 
inevitable pain of a full transition to market economics. 
  Ferdinand Kinsky, director of the European Studies 
department 
at the Central European University in Prague, said the policy 
may backfire on Klaus just prior to the next general elections 
in 1996. 
  "This may all mean that the big problems are still ahead of 
us. The bankruptcies, the rationalization of companies," he 
said. "Will these potential problems come before or after the 
next general election?" 
  While there are strong economic reasons for the Czech 
Republic's uniqueness, part of the difference also lies in the 
history of communism in Central and Eastern Europe. 
  Unlike most of the countries in the region, the Czechs were 
remarkably supportive of the Communist Party in the years 
following World War II--even more than their fellow citizens in 
Slovakia at the time. 
  In the 1946 elections, a greater percentage of Czechs than 
the minority Slovaks supported the communists, giving the 
national party a solid victory at the polls with 38 percent of 
the popular vote. 
  This popularity continued largely unabated until the 1968 
Soviet-led invasion of the country squashed the Prague Spring 
reforms. 
  From that time, the Czechoslovak communists ossified into 
isolated cadres of privileged apparatchiks. 
  "The cadres here were isolated [and] just incredibly 
clueless. ... They didn't even understand Gorbachev," said 
Orenstein. 
  Meanwhile, the Hungarian communists were introducing market 
reforms throughout the 1980s, and the Polish government entered 
into power-sharing negotiations with the Solidarity labor union 
in mid-1989. Even today, the Communist Party of Bohemia and 
Moravia (KSCM) continues to cling to its title when virtually 
every other communist party in the region has changed its name. 
  The result is that most people in Hungary and Poland don't 
remember the pre-1989 communists with the same bitterness as 
most Czechs. 
  On the other hand, Orenstein predicted the huge 
organizational apparatus that left-wing Czech parties inherited 
from the previous regime will serve them well in local elections 
this fall. 
  In contrast, Klaus' Civic Democratic Party (ODS) is having 
relative difficulties recruiting members and candidates in the 
country's remoter regions. 
  "All the intelligent people in the villages are in the 
[Communist] Party," said Orenstein. 
  The local elections scheduled for this fall, which could be 
accompanied by the republic's first Senate elections, will be 
the first indication of whether the Czech people will follow the 
regional trend back toward social democracy or continue to 
follow their own government's version of neo-liberalism.

  [Text] Budapest, 28 June (MTI) -- The founding session of 
Hungary's new Parliament was opened today by President Arpad 
Goncz. After the National Anthem, the President gave a short 
address. 
  "I greet you on the occasion of your gathering as the second 
freely and democratically elected National Assembly of the 
Republic of Hungary. I must note with pride that the 1994 
general elections went smoothly and faultlessly, showing the 
strength and maturity of our democracy. High electoral turnout 
shows that Hungarian people care for their own future and are 
consciously ready to express their political opinion and will." 
  Goncz thanked all those who helped organize the elections. 
  ``The Parliament is Hungary's supreme public-law body, with 
responsibility for the future of the country. 
  "Its accomplishments determine our life day by day. The 
National Assembly is based on the past, tried by the present, 
and judged by the future," Goncz said. 
  "How Hungary's citizens see our democracy work depends on 
you. And Hungarians all over the world, who are bound to Hungary 
not by legal ties but a common past, language, culture, fate, 
and vital interests, will also watch your moves carefully," 
Goncz continued. 
  ``I beg you -- never forget that legislative work and duties 
do not put Parliament above society, but oblige it to serve 
society. 
  ``It is not my place to sum up or even touch on the four 
years' work of the previous Parliament. Nor will I answer the 
frequently recurring question whether the nation has voted for 
or against something. But I believe I can firmly state that 
people voted in hope that their expectations will be fulfilled 
in the future, and they would like to see life secure and 
predictable -- and peaceful. 
  "People want to follow a route that advances the country in 
time instead of taking it back to some earlier stage, allowing 
as much of the past to be built on as needed to stabilise the 
future."

  [Text] Budapest, 27 May (MTI) -- Ten of the 12 ministers, 
plus one minister without portfolio, in the new government to be 
installed in July, will be from the Hungarian Socialist Party 
(MSZP), which won an absolute majority at the elections with 54 
percent of the parliamentary seats. Three will be from the 
second most popular party, the Alliance of Free Democrats 
(SZDSZ), which received nearly 18 percent of the seats. 
  The prime minister candidate is Gyula Horn, who was foreign 
minister in the Nemeth cabinet in 1989-90; Laszlo Bekesi will be 
finance minister for the second time; the new foreign minister 
is Laszlo Kovacs; and the minister of industry and trade will be 
the Former State Secretary Laszlo Pal. 
  Twelve members of the new cabinet also held seats in the 
previous Parliament, and -- with one exception -- they entered 
the new assembly from individual constituencies. 
  Gyula Horn (62), chairman and prime minister candidate of 
the 
main ruling party, the MSZP, filled diplomatic posts for thirty 
years under the Kadar regime, and was foreign minister in the 
reform-communist Nemeth cabinet, which paved the way for the 
political changes. 
  Born in Budapest on July 5, 1932 to factory worker parents 
with seven children, Horn studied at Rostov College of Economics 
in the Soviet Union from 1950 to 1954. 
  After five years at the Finance Ministry, he worked for two 
years at the Foreign Ministry's Soviet Department. He was a 
diplomat in Sofia from 1961 to 1963, and in Belgrade between 
1963 and 1969. 
  Later he joined the Foreign Affairs Department of the 
Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party [MSZMP], which he headed from 
1983 to 1985, invested with powers similar to a foreign minister. 
  He was secretary of state at the Foreign Ministry between 
1985 and 1989, and foreign minister in 1989-90, all the while 
ascending in the party hierarchy. As a reform-communist, he 
became a presidium member of the MSZP, founded in 1989, and 
became party chairman after the MSZP's election defeat in May 
1990. Horn was heavily involved in preparing the Hungarian 
Government decision that allowed East Germans to leave Hungary 
for the Federal Republic of Germany through Austria, effective 
September 11, 1989. For this move, which has been widely 
regarded in world politics as the first rupture in the Berlin 
Wall, Horn received the Charles Award, one of the most 
prestigious German honors, in Aachen in 1990. 
  In 1989, he also became the first diplomat from a socialist 
country to sign an agreement establishing diplomatic relations 
with South Korea. 
  In the Parliament formed after free elections on May 2, 
1990, 
the opposition Socialist group gained prestige despite having 
only 8.5 percent of the seats. 
  Polls put Horn among the three or four most popular 
politicians throughout the last four years. As the Socialists 
became more popular, Horn and his party increasingly came under 
attack. 
  He headed Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee until early 
1993, when pressure to resign came from the ruling parties who 
claimed he could not represent national interests as the 
Socialist chairman. 
  The prime minister candidate has dismissed the fears of a 
Socialist victory bringing back the communist era as absurd. He 
says that the social-democrat MSZP does not want, and Hungary's 
plural democracy does not allow, a return to the old regime. 
  Gabor Kuncze (44), the SZDSZ's former prime minister 
candidate and current nominee for interior minister and 
coalition deputy prime minister, gained a seat in the previous 
Parliament with the SZDSZ's support, joining the party only two 
years ago. The politician -- who is a qualified economist and 
production engineer -- became the SZDSZ's leader in Parliament 
in 1993, and its prime minister candidate in autumn of the same 
year. 
  At a televised debate prior to the first round of the May 
general elections, the pragmatic, witty Kuncze outrivalled the 
list leaders of the other large parties, as opinion polls 
showed. (The Socialists were represented at the debate by 
Deputy Chairman Imre Szekeres due to Horn's car accident). 
Foreign minister candidate Laszlo Kovacs, a 55-year-old 
economist, won his parliamentary mandate via the MSZP's 
Gyor-Sopron county list. From 1975 to 1986, he worked for the 
Foreign Affairs Department of the former MSZP's Central 
Committee, and was deputy foreign minister between 1986 and 
1989. Under Horn's ministerial tenure, in 1989-90, he was 
secretary of state for foreign affairs. He was a member of the 
outgoing Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, which he headed 
from 1993. He is in charge of the working group of the MSZP's 
parliamentary faction for foreign policy, security, and defense. 
  The would-be minister of finance, Dr Laszlo Bekesi, 52, 
holder of a high academic degree in economics, was a member of 
the former council apparatus between 1968 and 1980. He held the 
positions of economic policy secretary of the MSZMP's Budapest 
committee from 1981 to 1985, deputy finance minister from 1985 
to 1989, and finance minister from 1989-90. He headed the 
outgoing Parliament's Tax Subcommittee, and was a member of the 
Committee for European Community Affairs. It is a generally 
held opinion that the liberal- minded Bekesi was the main 
proponent of an MSZP-SZDSZ coalition. He is his party's senior 
economic expert and leader of the team that worked out the 
MSZP's economic program. 
  The MSZP's nominee for minister of agriculture, Dr Laszlo 
Lakos (49) -- a veterinarian and company management engineer by 
profession -- led a cooperative farm for 22 years. He was 
deputy chairman of the previous Parliament's Economic and 
Agricultural Committees. He has been local councillor in the 
village of Korostetlen (east Hungary) since 1990. 
  Justice minister candidate Dr Pal Vastagh, a 48-year-old 
lawyer, received a Ph.D. in political theory from Moscow in 
1986. Holder of a high academic degree in law and political 
sciences, he filled various posts at the law faculty of Szeged 
University for almost 20 years, and became dean at the end of 
the 1980's. He was a member of the previous Parliament's 
Constitutional, Legislative, and Judicial Committee. He is a 
member of the MSZP's presidium and board. 
  The 32-year-old Gabor Fodor, a lawyer by profession, is to 
become the new minister of education and culture. In 1988, he 
was a founding member of the Federation of Young Democrats 
(FIDESZ), which he represented in the outgoing Parliament. He 
headed Parliament's Committee on Human Rights, Minorities, and 
Religious Affairs between 1990 and 1993, and was member of the 
National Security Committee in 1992-93. In 1993, following 
disputes within the FIDESZ leadership, he left the party and 
simultaneously resigned as a deputy. At the elections, where he 
won a parliamentary seat in the individual race, he was entered 
at second place on the SZDSZ's national list, as a non-party 
candidate. 
  The future labor minister, Magda Kovacs Kosa (54), a teacher 
of Hungarian and French, was a full-time trade union activist 
after 13 years of teaching and headmaster work. She was a 
secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions from 1985 to 
1990, and a member of Parliament's Immunity and Incompatibility 
Committee. 
  Dr Ferenc Baja, the 39-year-old candidate for minister of 
environment and regional policy, graduated from the Hungarian, 
Popular Education, and Philosophy Faculty of Debrecen 
University. He filled appropriate posts at schools, public 
institutions, and local municipalities. He was director of the 
city gallery of Nyiregyhaza (east Hungary) from 1990. He is a 
deputy chairman of the MSZP, and a new member of Parliament.
