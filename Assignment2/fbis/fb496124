<F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>
  [Text] Taipei, June 6 (CNA) -- Premier Lien Chan arrived in 
Mexico from Guatemala early Monday [6 June] morning (Taipei 
time) for a private visit, according to a news release issued by 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
  Lien is visiting Mexico at the invitation of his friend, 
Mario Vazquez, who owns a number of news organizations and 
businesses in the Central American country, the ministry said. 
  Vazquez, who visited Taiwan last year, is very friendly to 
Taiwan and has contributed a lot to promoting substantive 
relations between the Republic of China [ROC] and Mexico, the 
ministry noted. Lien is the highest-ranking ROC official to 
visit Mexico since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in 
1971. 
  While there, the ministry said, Lien will meet with Mexican 
business leaders on Mexico's economic situation since it joined 
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). 
  Lien may also exchange views with Mexican officials on 
possible investment and economic cooperation projects between 
the two countries and seek Mexico's support for Taiwan's bid to 
join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, government 
sources said. 
  Taiwan-Mexican trade has increased steadily since 1989 when 
the semi-official China External Trade Development Council 
opened a representative office in Mexico. Two-way trade totaled 
about US $700 million in 1993, with Taiwan enjoying a surplus of 
US $300 million. 
  As a NAFTA member, Mexico provides easy access for foreign 
investors to the vast North American market. Many Taiwan 
companies have set up production facilities in Mexican cities 
bordering the United States in recent years. 
  The ROC opened a representative office in Mexico City on May 
1 to further promote bilateral exchanges. In Taipei, Mexico has 
issued multiple entry visas for Taiwan visitors since June 1991. 
  Lien is being accompanied by his wife and several Foreign 
Ministry officials, including Vice Foreign Minister Fang 
Chin-yen, on his Mexican tour. 
  Lien will leave Mexico Tuesday (Taipei time) for New York 
for 
a family reunion with his two children who are studying there. 
The premier is scheduled to return to Taipei Saturday. 
  Lien, heading a 21-member entourage, flew to El Salvador in 
late May to attend the inauguration of new Salvadoran president, 
Armando Calderon Sol. He then made a four-day official visit to 
Guatemala. Most members of Lien's entourage will not accompany 
Lien to Mexico and the United States. 
  This is Lien's second overseas trip this year, following a 
visit to Honduras and Belize in January.

<F P=106> [Statement by Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace </F>
and reconciliation in Chiapas, in his Mexico City office on 1 
June] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: We have reached a crucial 
stage in the peace process in Chiapas. The fact that the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has concluded 
consultations for an honorable peace in Chiapas -- consultations 
that resulted from the talks in San Cristobal de las Casas -- is 
an indication of the EZLN's sense of responsibility. As 
everyone knows, the EZLN's CCRI- CG [Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Movement - General Command] has declared itself in 
permanent session to discuss the opinions received and to make a 
response, which would be made known to the public. 
  Therefore, we are at a crucial stage of the peace 
reconstruction process. The communities that were consulted 
were precisely those that decided to go to war. The fact that 
these communities have been consulted on the possibility of 
peace is in itself a political fact of the utmost importance. 
Of course, the conclusion of the consultation does not mean 
that a new step in favor of peace has been taken. Three 
strategic possibilities are presented as an outcome of the 
Chiapas conflict. 
  The first one is that decisions by the sides, accidents, or 
social events foreign to the sides lead to an act of 
belligerence in the future. The second one is that the current 
situation, which has prevented war, might continue by the will 
of the sides as a result of new political decisions and the 
continuation of the truce, that is, by mediation and 
communication. 
  The third possibility is that, as a result of the EZLN's 
current decision to hold consultations and the Mexican 
Government's own decisions, a new step can be taken to construct 
peace, which can increase security for the Chiapas community, 
the Mexican Army, the EZLN, and the country in general. 
  The point we have reached is the result of a special effort 
for peace on the part of the government, the Mexican Army, the 
State of Chiapas, the Mexican Congress, the Chiapas Congress, 
the Higher Court of Justice of Chiapas, the Mexican society, and 
the EZLN, as well as mediation and the communities. All of these 
political forces have unanimously supported peace. This is not 
the time to wait with our arms crossed. If the required steps 
are not taken before the August elections, it will be very 
difficult to make any headway in the future. 
  To consolidate progress in the peace process, today, I 
presented to the president of the Republic a confidential report 
on the status of the conflict and the political actions that the 
government can take, indicating the solution that I regard as 
the most appropriate considering the causes of the uprising and 
the solution that can protect the interests of society and the 
Mexican State. In this report, I requested the president of the 
Republic's support for decisions that might represent a new 
response of harmony to the EZLN's probable answer. 
  In addition, today, I sent to the EZLN General Command a 
confidential communique mentioning the points that would 
increase the tranquility of society and the Mexican Army, 
reassure the EZLN itself, and represent a significant 
contribution for the peace process. 
  Society is not asking to have the sides confront one another 
in a dilemma of peace or war. Instead, society demands a clear, 
unambiguous demonstration, such as the demonstrations at the 
beginning of the year, which made it possible to stop the war. 
  On the one hand, society asks for a public expression -- 
with 
nonbelligerent actions -- of the EZLN's commitment for a 
political solution. On the other, society asks for a full 
definition -- with nonbelligerent actions -- on the part of the 
Mexican Government. 
  No one should grow impatient in this decisive hour. For this 
reason, I hereby appeal to all political, social, and civil 
forces, economic sectors, national leaders, and the local and 
international media, to join their voices in support of the 
peace process. 
  The possibility of a new step forward in the peace process 
is, not only in the hands of the EZLN, but in the hands of the 
government and civil society. This is the time for those truly 
concerned for peace to express themselves.

  [Text] The Baja California Attorney General's Office is 
investigating the possible entry of a large shipment of weapons 
through the state's border in view of the recent confiscation of 
50 AK-47 rifles in Mexicali. This was disclosed by Baja 
California Governor Ernesto Ruffo Appel in Mexicali. 
  [Begin Ruffo recording] Well, everyone knows that we have 
seized some weapons here. I think we recently seized 
approximately 50 of them. They were apparently part of a larger 
shipment. Therefore, we are investigating. [end recording] 
  According to police, the AK-47 rifles, which were found in a 
clandestine workshop in Mexicali, were modified for automatic 
fire. Ruffo Appel said various police forces and the Army are 
conducting special operations in the state to detect the entry 
of weapons.

<F P=106> ["Bulletin" issued by the Secretariat of National Defense in </F>
Mexico City on 2 June -- read by announcer] 
  [Text] Given the events in the Chiapas highlands at the 
beginning of the year, the Secretariat of National Defense 
intensified its investigation of the illegal shipment of weapons 
to our country. Among the evidence gathered, in late January we 
received indication of a possible shipment of 2,000 AK-47 
rifles, which could be part of a larger shipment. In other 
words, this case is over four-months old. 
  Upon receiving this information, the Secretariat of National 
Defense established the hypothesis that these arms could be 
smuggled to any state with high incidence of drug trafficking, 
or other crime problems. 
  The Secretariat of National Defense alerted other Federal 
agencies, so they could take appropriate action to confirm the 
veracity of this report. The information was received at the 
official level, and it was handled in a confidential manner. 
Currently there is no evidence of an illegal shipment of weapons 
from abroad. 
  The Secretariat of Government and the Attorney General's 
Office also conducted an investigation into this case, with 
negative results. All information on gun running is 
investigated in great detail, and in several cases -- like in 
this case -- investigations turn out negative.

<F P=106> [Report by Oscar Camacho Guzman] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, the Chamber of Deputies approved an 
electoral "minireform" that had been agreed upon by the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], National Action Party 
[PAN], and the Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD], thus 
changing the content of Article 77 of the Federal Code of 
Institutions and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe) regarding the 
employment of citizen advisers. The reform allows them to earn 
income derived from the free practice of their professions, 
bonuses, and author's and publications' royalties during the 
time they occupy this post. 
  The reform was approved during talks among the PRI, PAN, 
PRD, 
and the Government Secretariat after journalist Miguel Angel 
Granados Chapa asked the persons who participate in the 
appointment process to define the nature of citizen advisers and 
not to turn them into officials, but allow them to retain their 
function in society," according to an explanation he publicly 
gave last Saturday. [no beginning quotation mark as published] 
  The reform the Chamber of Deputies approved yesterday does 
not alter, however, the single paragraph of the Cofife's Article 
77 to which only two paragraphs are attached to detail four 
exceptions allowing citizen advisers to earn some remuneration. 
A differentiation in the income of the citizen advisers is 
introduced this way, since only those who work or perform some 
function for the federal government, states, municipalities, or 
political parties or those who earn some remuneration from 
individuals involving dependence or subordination must abandon 
their jobs. 
  The citizen advisers' income that comes from the "free 
practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' and 
publications' royalties" will have another legal status. This 
creates the opportunity for them to perform another remunerated 
activity within the conditions established by the "minireform" 
in tandem with their post in the Federal Electoral Institute 
(IFE) General Council. 
  Two of the six IFE General Council civilian advisers 
maintain 
a labor relationship with an institution. This case applies to 
National Autonomous University of Mexico staff members Jose 
Woldenberg, professor of the Policital Sciences Faculty, and 
Ricardo Pozas, director of the Social Research Institute. 
  Granados Chapa, in turn, is the editor of a magazine; Ortiz 
Pinchetti [no first name as published] and Santiago Creel have 
their law offices; and Fernando Zertuche performs editorial work. 
  According to the explanations given to justify this 
initiative, the goal of this addition is to guarantee "a greater 
independence and impartiality" on the part of the citizen 
advisers. 
  The initiative was submitted almost at the end of the 
session, and in view of the great urgency to have it approved 
yesterday so that next Friday the citizen advisers can be sworn 
in legally, the PRI, PAN, and PRD blocs agreed to forgo the 
congressional ritual, and, based on Articles 59 and 60 of the 
internal regulations, waived the drafting of the respective 
report, the first and second readings of the report, the debate, 
and any future possibility of proposing changes. 
  With this agreement by the PRI, PAN, and PRD, this 
"minireform," which in effect constitutes the fourth electoral 
reform of this six-year period, did not take more than 10 
minutes of the lawmakers' time and joined the list of 
initiatives approved at full speed by the PRI legislators, whom 
the PAN and most of the PRD deputies not only did not criticize 
but rather supported. 
  There were, however, seven abstentions among the PRD 
legislators. The Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction 
Party cast five votes against it, as opposed to the 269 in votes 
in favor, by the automatic PRI-PAN-PRD majority. The initiative 
approved yesterday also amends the Cofife's Article 77 and 
subparagraph B of paragraph 5 of Article 74 so that they read as 
follows: 
  Article 74, paragraphs five, subparagraph B: "From this 
list, 
the corresponding commission will draft an individual report 
containing the slate of citizen advisers and alternates. The 
Chamber of Deputies will elect the citizen advisers by a vote of 
two thirds of the deputies present. The proposals by the 
advisers will be voted on based on the procedure outlined by the 
Internal Governing Rules for the General Congress of the United 
States of Mexico on its chapter on voting." 
  Article 77: "During their mandate, the citizen advisers of 
the General Council may not perform any function or job for the 
Federation, states, municipalities, or political parties. 
Neither may they accept a remunerated post or employment that 
entails a dependence or subordination from individuals." 
  "The citizen advisers may earn income stemming from the free 
practice of their profession, bonuses, or authors' or 
publications royalties so long as the independence, 
impartiality, or equity that must govern the exercise of their 
function is not undermined. They may hold unpaid jobs in 
scientific, literary, or charity associations. "For any 
clarification regarding the interpretation of this article, the 
Federal Electoral Tribunal will be called."

  [Text] In a special session, the general council of the 
Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] was installed with its new 
membership, as established by recent political and electoral 
reforms. The six citizen advisers, who were proposed and 
approved by the political parties in Congress, were sworn in and 
will be able to vote from now on. In an initial speech, 
Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, president of the IFE general 
council, analyzed the legal reforms and the agreements that have 
been reached. He listed 36 agreements reached since January so 
the elections will be honest. He said that in accordance with 
the law, the elections will be held on 21 August. 
  [Begin Carpizo recording] On behalf of the federal 
executive, 
I want to reiterate that the government's commitment to act 
impartially and legally is unalterable. It has not and will not 
be subject to anything other than the law. [end recording] 
  After a recess and in a special session, Samuel del Villar, 
representative of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], 
reported that members of his party found electoral material in a 
trash heap in Mexico City. He said they will file a report on 
this once the Electoral Prosecutor's Office is established. 
  [Begin del Villar recording] We will provide documents 
related to this to the Attorney General's Office. [end recording] 
  The IFE council approved that a commission formed by three 
of 
the six citizen advisers will investigate this issue.

  [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (AFP) -- Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, 
center-left presidential candidate, has received an anonymous 
death threat in Oaxaca, in southern Mexico, where he is on a 
campaign tour, the official NOTIMEX news agency reported on 
Saturday. 
  The anonymous threat against Cardenas stated: "We are ready 
to eradicate social blights. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is one of 
them. Remember what happened to Colosio. Say good-bye to your 
candidate, this week he dies." 
  Colosio, presidential candidate of the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), was assassinated on 23 March and 
although the perpetrator was arrested, the motive has yet to be 
clarified. 
  The source indicated that the anonymous threat, which was 
received by the Oaxaca state committee of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD, center-left), was sent by an 
organization called Lady of Guadalupe Archdiocesan Sanctuary. 
  At an event in the community of Macuiltianguis, Oaxaca, 
Cardenas scoffed at the threat, indicating that "their bark is 
worse than their bite." He added, "when someone wants to do 
something, he does not announce it. There is nothing to worry 
about."

<F P=106> [Report by David Carrizales] </F>
  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 1 Jun -- Mario Ruiz Massieu, 
deputy Attorney General of the Republic, said police commanders 
or policemen who arrest drug traffickers will receive a reward, 
but admitted that his office "does not have the means or the 
capacity to compete with the corruption funds offered by the 
drug cartels." 
  Ruiz Massieu reiterated that Attorney General's Office (PGR) 
officials who do not work will be fired and that, in the event 
that their links to drug traffickers are proved, action will be 
taken against them. Ruiz Massieu told members of the Nuevo Leon 
Lawyers Association (CANL) that since Jorge Carpizo joined the 
PGR and later became Government Secretary, he has encouraged 
citizens to view the institution "with trust and not with 
terror." 
  He said that regardless of the established inertia and 
faults, there is confidence that the PGR can become the 
institution that all Mexicans want. Ruiz Massieu asked lawyers 
and citizens to criticize and point out faults and deficiencies 
so that all PGR officials and agents do their duty, if not by 
conviction, then at least out of fear of being exposed. 
  After meeting with CANL members, the federal official 
reiterated in an interview that the call made a few days ago to 
PGR delegates and deputies, as well as to Federal Judicial 
Police commanders, was not an ultimatum; "they were simply told 
that they must know who the most important drug traffickers are 
in the states where they work because their work is to 
investigate and they should know all these networks." 
  Therefore, he added, they should yield results, and these 
should begin to be seen in about four weeks. If by then no 
results are seen, he reiterated, "we will analyze whether or not 
this is due to incompetence or negligence, or because they are 
covering up and are accomplices; this is what I said and what I 
am repeating." 
  He added that officials who manage to arrest drug 
traffickers 
will receive a reward, but the PGR does not have the capacity or 
means to equal or surpass what the criminals may offer. He said 
the desire to earn a reward and the commitment to work and serve 
society as citizens and human beings must be combined. 
  Afterward, in a meeting with local business members of the 
Nuevo Leon Civic Council Institutions and Civilian Association, 
Ruiz Massieu received a request by Gerardo Gomez Valdez, legal 
director for the Monterrey National Chamber of Commerce, for the 
PGR to unfreeze 200 million new pesos seized from three currency 
exchange houses (Monterrey, Colon, and Mercado de Cambios) in 
this city, which were charged with laundering money. This 
freeze not only affected the business owners, but over 200 
businessmen who had nothing to do with the legal procedure.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Canon and Fernando Ramos from the "Midday </F>
Television Newscast"] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and Defense Minister 
Rafael Pardo announced a big offensive abroad to counter 
Colombia's bad human rights image. Colombia will open its doors 
to all organizations that oversee human rights and display all 
acts of violence, facing up to reality without issuing 
unilateral, incomplete, or generalized information. The 
strategy, according to Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio, is 
the defense and promotion of a search to end impunity. 
  [Begin recording] [Sanin] We admit there are human rights 
problems in Colombia. What we cannot accept is the assertion by 
London's Amnesty International that the Colombian Government is 
involved in these violations. We encourage and defend human 
rights as a government. We do not accept the generalization 
made on violations of human rights by the Armed Forces either. 
  [Pardo] This should also be seen in the context of 
Colombia's 
crime and violence. It is not the same to have human rights 
violated in a perfect state, a state where everything is 
absolutely controlled, and where justice works like clockwork, 
rather than a state where there are constant reforms, a state 
that is developing new mechanisms and has overcome huge problems 
in its integration and judicial system. [end recording] 
  In today's meeting with the Colombian ambassadors to the 
European Union, the defense minister broached the topic of 
police reforms, which is one of the bases for the resolve to 
change. To reaffirm this will to change, the government would 
be willing to invite an Amnesty International commission to 
verify the situation on site. 
  All these arguments have become even more heated with the 
report by the OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
released a few days ago. Colombia does not get high marks from 
this report either. This document adds to Amnesty 
International's report and is what has the argument running red 
hot regarding the country's situation and reality. 
  [Begin OAS representative Raul Valladares recording] Due to 
the complexity of the Colombian situation, even greater efforts 
are called for, and this is basically what the report calls for. 
[end recording] 
  The argument is based on whether the human rights studies in 
Colombia are objective. For the Colombian Government, the lack 
of credibility of human rights reports, such as Amnesty 
International's, lies in the source of the data. The president, 
however, is not clear either on what investigative methodology 
is used. 
  [Begin presidential human rights adviser Carlos de Roux 
recording] The problem, nevertheless, is that one cannot say 
that most political homicides in Colombia are committed by 
public force members or criminal public force members. The 
public force is not responsible for most of these murders, and 
this is where Amnesty International's report is not truthful. 
[end recording] 
  A summit meeting will be held this afternoon between 
representatives of human rights organizations and the government 
to discuss criteria and face up to the problem. Human Rights 
Ombudsman Jaime Cordoba Trivino said that, although the human 
rights violations reports are exaggerated, the truth is that 
Colombia is also responsible. He added fuel to the argument by 
saying that Colombia is treating the matter mildly. 
  [Begin Cordoba recording] Human rights in Colombia is far 
more than a problem of international image. More than the 
solicitous actions of our ambassadors to the EC and the United 
States, what is really required is urgent government action, 
which should be fully committed to the Constitution and fully 
open and which should set out from the unquestionable basis of 
admitting that the truth of the matter is that it is very 
serious. [end recording] 
  Presidential candidate Ernesto Samper believes that an 
intermediate position should be sought in order to neutralize 
the serious economic effects that this argument could have at 
the international level. 
  [Begin Samper recording] Colombia should not attempt to hide 
the fact that human rights are violated. When these are proved 
we should accept this responsibility, but likewise, we expect 
international organizations to accept that Colombia is making 
efforts to control human rights violations. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Victor Javier from the "QAP Newscast"] </F>
  [Text] The latest report issued by the OAS Human Rights 
Committee focuses on the Colombian judicial system. It is not 
as harsh as the Amnesty International report, but it 
nevertheless leaves Colombia in a poor position regarding the 
defense of human rights. In a 400-page document, the OAS Human 
Rights Committee reports on the state of human rights in 
Colombia from 1990 to the present. 
  It concludes that the public security laws, the faceless 
judges, and secret witnesses and evidence harm the citizens' 
rights to defend themselves. The regulations regarding the 
state of emergency, which were recently approved at the National 
Congress as permanent legislation, violate international human 
rights agreements that Colombia signed and agreed to abide by. 
Military courts trying members of the Armed Forces, as a rule, 
hand down biased rulings. Torture is not a crime, according to 
Colombian legislation, and it is not prosecuted or punished. 
  The OAS Human Rights Committee recommends the following for 
the Colombian Government: In order to guarantee the human 
rights of all individuals, the secret justice system must be 
reformed. The government should enforce a state of emergency 
only in extremely serious situations. To ensure more just 
rulings, the civil justice system should try all those members 
of the Armed Forces who have been charged with a crime. 
Military immunity should be lifted in cases of torture, extra 
judicial executions, and disappearances. 
  [Begin Leo Valladares, member of the OAS Human Rights 
Committee, recording] We hope our report will serve to correct 
many of the mistakes we have found. [end recording] 
  The report concludes by criticizing Colombia for not 
following the human rights recommendations the OAS made in 1987.

  [Text] Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio has 
characterized as biased and unfair the gruesome images shown by 
"NTC News" from the video in which Amnesty International 
denounces human rights violations in Colombia. The foreign 
minister said the situations presented in the video cannot be 
considered the result of a premeditated government policy. 
  [Begin Sanin de Rubio recording] I cannot, under any 
circumstance, allow the government to be blamed for this 
violence, these murders, and this so-called social cleansing. I 
cannot agree with that, nor can I believe that everyone in the 
police force is corrupt. [end recording] 
  The foreign minister said that the government's doors are 
open to visits from the international community and that she has 
issued specific instructions to Colombia's ambassadors to invite 
nongovernment human rights organizations to Colombia.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 5 Jun (AFP) -- A dynamite bomb 
of moderate force killed two people when it exploded. The two 
people were carrying the bomb this Sunday in downtown Arauca, 
capital of the eastern department bearing the same name, located 
near the border with Venezuela, 350 km east of Santa Fe de 
Bogota, according to police. 
  The victims, Elizabeth Medina and William Montilla, were 
riding a motorcycle in downtown Arauca when the bomb went off. 
  The Arauca police are investigating the incident and said 
the 
guerrillas are to blame for the bloody incident, considering the 
upcoming 19 June presidential elections, in which the successor 
of President Cesar Gaviria for the 1994-1998 period will be 
chosen.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin </F>
Posada in Santa Fe de Bogota by Emisoras Caracol News Director 
Dario Arizmendi in Caracol's Santa Fe de Bogota studios; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Arizmendi] At 0704 we greet Colombian Foreign 
Minister Noemi Sanin Posada. Good morning. 
  [Sanin] Good morning, Dario. 
  [Arizmendi] What is the significance for Colombia of its 
chairing the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] for the next three years? 
  [Sanin] For us, this is very important recognition of 
Colombia's international policies. It is very important that 
110 countries have unanimously thought that Colombia could chair 
the NAM for three years and can host next year's meeting of the 
110 presidents. 
  [Arizmendi] In this case, who will preside over the meeting? 
The president or foreign minister? 
  [Sanin] The head of state and president of Colombia. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you not feel nostalgic that, after working to 
achieve this honorable designation for Colombia first, to 
receive the unanimous support of Latin America for Colombia's 
candidacy, and later to obtain the support of 110 countries, you 
will leave the post of foreign minister on 7 August and will not 
enjoy something you engineered? 
  [Sanin] No. As long as Colombia maintains its leadership and 
is able to coordinate the NAM forum, I will be very satisfied. 
This will give Colombia an opportunity to have greater 
negotiating and coordinating ability to deepen ties with these 
110 countries. This is very important for our country, and we 
are very satisfied with the recognition of President Gaviria's 
policies. 
  [Arizmendi] Mrs. Foreign Minister, isn't NAM an organization 
that has lost importance in recent years? Isn't it a 
bureaucratic organization? 
  [Sanin] That is not true. [words indistinct] obviously had a 
reason to exist when the Cold War was still going on and the 
world was bipolar, but today problems of developing countries 
are not yet over. This makes it necessary to have a policy or 
strategy to counter these problems. This will permit us to have 
the opportunity to negotiate problems at the United Nations. 
The NAM is very much heeded at the UN Security Council. 
  A great deal of progress has been made in the area of 
disarmament thanks to the independence of countries that had 
colonization problems. A lot has been done in the area of the 
environment. Important positions were negotiated during the [UN] 
Earth Summit. [words indistinct] prevented taxing developing 
countries. 
  Regarding human rights, we must establish important 
positions 
to prevent this issue from being politicized. In other words, 
we will be able to improve the negotiating capacity of 
developing countries in all areas and among ourselves. 
  [Arizmendi] You have led President Cesar Gaviria to the post 
of OAS secretary general, and you have also led Colombia to the 
presidency of NAM for the next three years. With this political 
success, why didn't you run for the presidency of the Republic? 
  [Sanin] [sighs] My work is here at the Foreign Affairs 
Ministry, but I also want to tell you these accomplishments are 
not mine. They belong to Colombia and its policies, as well as 
to the seriousness of our country. I thank you very much for 
your words, but it was not time for me to run for president. 
  [Arizmendi] This was not the moment, but does that mean the 
right moment may come later? 
  [Sanin] One never knows. 
  [Arizmendi] You are not upset with our question? 
  [Sanin] Well, I don't think anybody would be upset with such 
a question. 
  [Arizmendi] Could you give this idea some thought and 
perhaps 
run for president within four years? 
  [Sanin] I am now fulfilling my duty to work for Colombia, 
and 
this is a good job and a good campaign. [laughs] 
  [Arizmendi] A few days ago we interviewed Dr. Ernesto 
Samper Pizano on our program "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast. 
We also did so on our television program "Face to Face." He 
told us that you were virtually the only Colombian who can 
afford to be taken to the presidency in the next government. He 
said that if you choose to, you could remain in the Foreign 
Ministry, but that you could perfectly well go to the Colombian 
Embassy in Washington, to the United Nations or to any Colombian 
diplomatic mission abroad. Which of all those posts would you 
like? Would you like to remain as the head of the Foreign 
Ministry? 
  [Sanin] Look Dario, I have been so busy in the Colombian 
Foreign Ministry that I really have not had a chance to think 
about 7 August. We have the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, and 
we have to coordinate details on the environment. We have to 
prepare the commission for the transition of power to the next 
government. I truly have not had time to think of anything else. 
  [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, what is there left for you to 
round out Colombia's international endeavors? 
  [Sanin] We are reaching agreements with several countries. 
We are going to sign some agreements with (?China). We have to 
do well in the Ibero-American Summit, which 21 chiefs of state 
and the king and queen of Spain will attend. We are going to 
hold important talks on the Ibero-American community. We have 
to further integrate Latin America. We have to sign the free 
trade agreements on the Caribbean and Central America. The 
foreign trade minister is working arduously in that direction. 
We are rounding out our mission and are working to finish it. 
  [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, the women's conference will be 
held in Beijing next year. This coming Tuesday, 7 June, the 
president will officially launch Colombia's programs and 
preparations with a view to that summit. As foreign minister 
and as a woman, what role have you had or will you have in this 
important world event? 
  [Sanin] I am inside the vehicle and cannot hear your 
question 
well, would you mind repeating it? 
  [Arizmendi] Mrs. Minister, I am asking you about the 
international women's conference that will be held next year in 
Beijing and whose official acts will be launched this coming 7 
June by the president of the Republic. As a foreign minister 
and as a woman, what will be your participation in this event? 
  [Sanin] I beg your pardon, but I am inside a vehicle passing 
through a street where there is a lot of interference. As soon 
as I arrive in my office, we can talk because I can't hear a 
thing. 
  [Arizmendi] Do you hear me, Mrs. Minister? 
  [Sanin] No, I'm sorry, I have interference. We'll talk again 
as soon as I get to the office.

<F P=106> [Report by J. Orlando Gomez from the "Midday Television </F>
Newscast"] 
  [Text] Despite Colombia's poor image in the realm of human 
rights violations, it is very possible that the EC countries 
will increase its tariff benefits. Because of the huge 
sacrifices Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru have made in 
blood and money in the struggle against drug trafficking, the EC 
four years ago established a system that allows these Latin 
American countries' products to enter the 12 EC countries 
without paying tariffs or taxes. Thanks to this measure, a 
considerable amount of Colombian exports are entering the old 
continent without problems. EC Ambassador Jose Luis Benito 
Prior discussed the issue. 
  [Begin Benito Prior recording] This measure covers over 90 
percent of Colombia's exports, all industrial products, and a 
long list of farm products. Therefore, Colombia can 
congratulate itself for this positive atmosphere. [end 
recording] 
  Thanks to the good work of these countries in the struggle 
against drug trafficking, these preferential tariffs may be 
extended for another 10 years. 
  [Begin Benito Prior recording] In Europe we appreciate all 
the efforts that Colombia and other Latin American countries are 
making in this struggle. Much must still be done, and together 
we must try to foster a spirit of cooperation. [end recording] 
  These favorable conditions and terms will allow Colombia's 
most competitive products to establish roots on the old 
continent within a few years.

  [Text] Within the next few months the Army will change all 
of its weapons. The decision is part of a technological 
updating process that will provide the Armed Forces with more 
weapons to fight the guerrillas. 
  Among the weapons that will be changed are the estimated 
100,000 rifles currently owned by the military; the same amount 
of rifles will be purchased. The new 5.56 mm rifles will be of 
the same brand and will have the same characteristics as the 
U.S.-made M-16 and Israeli-made Galil rifles currently used in 
Colombia. Each weapon will cost between $1,500 and $3,000. 
This means that the investment being considered could cost 200 
billion pesos. 
  INDUMIL [State Military Industry Enterprise], which produces 
ammunition and weapons in Colombia, is conducting the technical 
and economic evaluation. Although the study is well under way, 
it may still last several months. In the United States, it took 
a year to make a similar decision. 
  The new Armed Forces rifles have been characterized as 
merciful. They were invented to wound instead of kill in combat. 
According to experts, they are more detrimental to the enemy, 
because they immobilize not only the wounded soldier but also 
those who come to his aid. These weapons are also lighter, 
which makes them more maneuverable, and they allow quicker troop 
deployment and facilitate the transportation of larger amounts 
of ammunition. They also reduce risks when there are incidents 
at checkpoints and during urban patrols.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by Miriam </F>
Wasserman and Victor Manuel Vargas in Santa Fe de Bogota; date 
not given] 
  [Text] [EL TIEMPO] The road to peace to which Israel and 
the PLO are committed is filled with uncertainties for the near 
future. Great courage is required. Has this effort yielded 
positive results? 
  [Peres] First, an uncertain peace is better than the 
certainty of war. If we cannot attain peace, we will have no 
uncertainties. I think we will continue to pay the price of 
peace before we can see its fruits. Nevertheless, we will not 
change our minds because of this fact. We will continue with 
the process. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What are the largest obstacles to peace at this 
time? 
  [Peres] There are different obstacles in different 
countries. 
We have to see how the Palestinians will get organized in Gaza 
and Jericho. Then we will continue to negotiate the various 
stages that follow in the process -- in other words, the 
expansion of their administration to five or six specific areas 
and the extension of autonomy to other territories. 
  The Syrians, on the other hand, want to conduct the 
negotiations in a very strange manner. They want the talks to 
be held behind closed doors and in a limited manner. If you 
want to normalize relations, you have to normalize the 
negotiations, because otherwise the people will not believe you 
are serious. I do not think Syria is doing things properly. 
Israel wants negotiations with Syria to be more open, at the 
ministerial level, and on a bilateral basis. We would like to 
negotiate on all issues -- that is, on peace, on security, and 
on the withdrawal from the Golan Heights. The Syrian president, 
however, wants us to say we will return the entire territory 
first, and then we can sit down to negotiate. I do not think 
this will happen. 
  With the Jordanians, we have already started. Our working 
relations with them are much better. I think it is important 
not only to resolve past problems and conflicts between us and 
the other countries of the region, but also to construct a new 
Middle East. If a new Middle East is not constructed, peace will 
not be secured. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Will this new Middle East be constructed based 
on 
a "land for peace" policy? 
  [Peres] You see, "relations for peace" are much more 
important than "land for peace." The problem of land can be 
settled, but, if we do not have good relations, the true problem 
will not have been resolved. Therefore, what we have to change 
is the climate in the Middle East. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Since we are talking about the climate, do you 
not consider it worrisome that the joy that was felt after the 
Declaration of Principles was signed in Washington in September 
has disappeared in Israel? 
  [Peres] I think that is not very important, because our 
government was elected for four years. In other words, it would 
not be wise for the government to revise its decisions every 
day. The government is not like a hospital, where a patient's 
temperature is taken every morning, a certain measure is taken 
to correct this, and the results are assessed at the end of the 
day. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Two Israeli soldiers were murdered recently in 
the Gaza Strip. What would occur if such things begin to occur 
frequently? Will Israel occupy the territories again? 
  [Peres] I am not going to answer that question, because I do 
not want to leave the impression we left Gaza to return there at 
a later date. 
  We are not going to return to Gaza. 
  What we are going to do is to demand that the Palestinians 
take all necessary measures to apprehend and punish those 
responsible for the crime. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some analysts believe this was not the right 
time 
to sign a peace agreement because the PLO is not ready to 
exercise leadership over the occupied territories. What do you 
think? 
  [Peres] I think the analysts should be replaced. Most 
analysts did not predict anything of that which has taken place 
so far. I do not know of one analyst who knew Gorbachev would 
end communism, or that Mandela would make peace with De Klerk. 
  I do not know of any analyst who knew we would take a first 
step toward peace in terms of Gaza and Jericho. I can only cite 
the man who was my leader, Ben Gurion, who said all experts are 
experts on things that have already happened; we do not have 
experts on what the future holds. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why is there so much difficulty with the 
election 
of the 24 members of the interim Palestinian Government? 
  [Peres] When you have appointments instead of elections, you 
have a problem. Every time you appoint one person, you make 10 
others unhappy. I think Arafat wanted to please many groups, 
and this is difficult to do. The PLO is a coalition of many 
opposing factions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you consider this a serious problem for 
Israel? 
  [Peres] We cannot decide who our counterparts should be, 
just 
as we cannot choose our parents. Nevertheless, what we can 
indeed decide is the kind of relationship we want to maintain 
with them. What we are trying to do is to build a new 
relationship. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you not think that relocating Israeli 
settlers 
now living in the occupied territories might contribute to peace? 
  [Peres] No. The best thing for peace would be for relations 
to improve between Jewish settlers and the Palestinians. If 
there are 400 Israeli settlers and 100,000 Palestinians in 
Hebron, what is the problem? 
  But some of these settlers are there because they think 
these 
territories belong to Israel and... 
  Thinking is not dangerous. The situation only becomes 
dangerous when you fire your gun. 
  [EL TIEMPO] But they are armed. 
  [Peres] We are going to adopt measures to seize their 
weapons, but we are not going to take measures against their 
dreams. We live in a democracy, and, in turn, they have the 
right to dream. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What specific measures will be taken to disarm 
Israeli settlers? 
  [Peres] We will explain to them that we are not going to 
allow force to define our relationship with the Arabs. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What role does the economy play in the future of 
peace? 
  [Peres] Peace is an economic measure. If there is no peace, 
a lot of money will be wasted in war. In the past 10 years, we 
have wasted $1 billion in weapons. With this money, we could 
have changed the Middle East. Consequently, making peace will 
contribute greatly to improving the economy. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What can and must the international community do 
to ensure and promote this process? 
  [Peres] The international community must support peace. We 
are trying to help Palestinians raise the necessary money to 
build their own administration and their own police. 
  The world must take part not only in peacekeeping missions 
but also in peacemaking missions. 
  For instance, what is taking place in Rwanda is terrible. 
There is a radio station that each morning calls on people to 
murder children, and no one has bombed that station. This is 
incredible. They say, "kill children" and you will end the 
problem. We are saying: Let's kill the problem in order that 
children can live. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What form does Israel ultimately want the 
territories to assume? 
  [Peres] We have already spoken about the idea of a common 
market. Where there is a clear majority, the government should 
be under the auspices of that majority, but no people should 
dominate another. For the Palestinians, the best solution would 
be the creation of a Jordanian-Palestinian federation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What do the Jordanians think of this? 
  [Peres] I think both the Jordanians and the Palestinians 
would be in favor of a federation, but I am not sure they agree 
on who should head it. 
  [EL TIEMPO] In an article for NEWSWEEK, Henry Kissinger said 
the moment Arafat stood next to Rabin at the White House Rose 
Garden (during the signing ceremony for the Declaration of 
Principles) the Palestinian state became an inevitability. What 
is your opinion? 
  [Peres] I believe he is a very wise man, but we do not 
agree. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Why is Israel opposed to a Palestinian state? 
  [Peres] If you have a Jordanian state and a Palestinian 
state, the conflict would worsen. The majority of Jordanians 
are Palestinians, and the majority of the Palestinians have 
Jordanian passports. It is an artificial division. If you have 
a problem, you must find one solution, not two. If you have two 
solutions, then you are creating another problem. 
  The land that Israel returns must remain demilitarized. A 
Jordanian-Palestinian federation would guarantee this in part of 
the territory, but if we have two states, an arms buildup would 
immediately begin and we would have to pay the price of this. 
  [EL TIEMPO] During your entire life, and especially since 
Israel was created, you have been in a leadership position and 
have undoubtedly left your mark on history. How and for what 
would you like to be remembered? 
  [Peres] For saving the lives of five or 10 children. That is 
the most important thing. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What can the Colombian people learn of the peace 
process you are conducting? 
  [Peres] I believe that the most important thing is to know 
that there are no complex situations but, instead, complex 
people, and the people can overcome such complexities if they 
take the situation into their own hands. We must look toward 
the future and not toward the past.

  [Text] Quito, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ecuadoran "Red Sun" 
armed movement announced today that it reached a "peace 
agreement" with the Ecuadoran Government, which will permit it 
to surrender its weapons and quit subversive activities. 
  Ramiro Celi Garces, foremost leader of the subversive group, 
admitted at the National Defense Ministry the movement's 
"military defeat" and announced it will join the peaceful 
democratic struggle. He recognized the mistake of acting with 
weapons when violence is not favorable "at this historic moment" 
and he denied the group had engaged in terrorism or kidnappings. 
  Celi Garces said the struggle of the "Red Sun" was directed 
at ending the injustices of "a totally atomized society" and the 
misfortunes of people subject to an unconscientious government. 
  Our organization "has deemed it necessary to stop using 
weapons as an alternative" and "to proclaim our will to secure a 
peace agreement," he stated. 
  The proposal by the Red Sun and Inti Puka [red sun in 
Quechua] is based on commitments that establish eliminating the 
organization, quitting clandestine activities, surrendering 
weapons to the Army, and rejoining the country's democratic 
activities. 
  In exchange the group asks the government "as a 
demonstration 
of its will to achieve peace to redefine its social and economic 
policies" in order to improve the living conditions of the 
people." 
  Inti Puka also requests the government to release of one of 
its leaders and the to end all police and military control of 
the demobilized militants of the "Red Sun Communist Party," as 
Celi Garces calls it. 
  Defense Minister Jose Gallardo expressed his satisfaction 
with the decision of the group, which has been linked to the 
Peruvian Shining Path because of its actions and slogans, 
although no connection has ever been proven. 
  Gallardo said the Red Sun's decision to adopt the path of 
peace represents a victory for peace-loving Ecuadorans. 
  The group had been active in Ecuador for three years and had 
been blamed for several dynamite attacks against public offices 
which only caused material damages, including damage to an 
electricity tower of the Papallactal potable water plant last 
May. 
  Leaders Celi Garces and Patricio Alban Sanchez, representing 
the demobilized members whose number is not known, surrendered 
their weapons to Gallardo at the Defense Ministry. 
Sophisticated weapons were exhibited at a sumptuous ceremony. 
  The ceremony was attended by the military high command, 
members of the cabinet, representatives of human rights, and 
relatives of those laying down their weapons. 
  Political analysts noted that the surrender of weapons has 
been the result of intense investigations and Armed Forces 
surveillance of the movement's activities. 
  A 19-year-old student, who was captured in August 1993 for 
being a member of the Red Sun, denied that the group has any 
connection with any Ecuadoran political party, as local media 
have reported. 
  The last subversive group recognized in Ecuador was the 
so-called "Alfaro Lives, Dammit" which in 1990 dissolved itself 
upon signing a peace accord with the Social Democratic 
government of Rodrigo Borja (1988-92).

  [Text] Quito, 3 Jun (EFE) -- The press and an Ecuadoran 
Socialist deputy expressed today their doubts about the real 
existence and importance of the "Red Sun" ("Puka Inti" in 
Quechua) Maoist group, which without prior notice decided on 
Thursday to surrender its weapons to the Armed Forces in a 
surprising capitulation ceremony. 
  Without stating it was all a farce but suggesting that the 
group, allegedly linked to Peru's "Shining Path," was perhaps 
formed by members of state security, the Ecuadoran press 
reported today on the ceremony without commenting on or 
addressing the issue in its editorials. 
  "Many doubts emerged following the surprising surrender of 
weapons, which seemed to have been withdrawn from the armory, 
for they don't have scratches or stains. Everything has taken 
place so quickly that there are doubts about the veracity of the 
ceremony and the true involvement of `Red Sun' leaders in acts 
of war," the newspaper EXPRESO said. 
  "Red Sun: debut and farewell," was the headline of the 
newspaper "HOY," while "EL UNIVERSO" recalled that the group 
"appeared on the national scene three years ago with various 
acts of urban violence without any repercussion." The only 
actions staged by the group have been the hurling of dynamite 
explosives at public buildings and some parties offices, causing 
minor damage and no casualties. In addition, they painted 
slogans on walls calling for the elimination of popular 
organizations' leaders, whom they accused of treason, and 
others, stating: "Be patriotic, kill an Indian." 
  During the ceremony, "Red Sun" Secretary General Ramiro Celi 
congratulated the Armed Forces' military investigative work that 
defeated his group, denied responsibility for the attacks or the 
slogans on walls, and thanked among others, Socialist Deputy 
Diego Delgado for his contribution to the peace process. 
  Hours before the ceremony and at the request of relatives of 
"Red Sun" members, Delgado denounced before the press the arrest 
and disappearance of these members. Nevertheless, the deputy 
stated today that "the whole thing seems very strange, a real 
trick to give the impression that supposedly an alleged 
political-military organization had repented without ever firing 
a single shot, not meaning that it would have been better 
otherwise." 
  "All of this calls for deep reflection, and personally I am 
not convinced. Their social and political origin, their 
ideological and practical beliefs, and a host of other aspects 
are completely foreign to guerrilla movements that have existed 
elsewhere," Delgado repeated. Delgado then asked: "Does `Red 
Sun' exist or did it ever exist as an organization of such a 
size, which certain media presented in order to project a 
peaceful image by other interests?" 
  An "Ecuavisa" commentator agreed with Delgado and was also 
of 
the opinion that "there are questions that remain in the air 
that raise doubts whether in fact the group really existed."

  [Excerpts] Opposition leaders yesterday decided to suspend 
the talks they are holding with the government under the 
governability pact. The opposition decided to withdraw from the 
pact because the Colorado Party has filed a petition asking the 
Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a law that prevents 
military and police officers on active duty from being members 
of political parties. 
  The decision to withdraw from the talks was announced 
yesterday by Juan Manuel Benitez Florentin, president of the 
Authentic Radical Liberal Party [PLRA]; by Miguel Angel 
Montaner, president of the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; and 
by Victor Sanchez Villagra, president of the Febrerista 
Revolutionary Party [PRF]. 
  The opposition leaders noted that they were withdrawing from 
the interparty board until the respective executive boards of 
their parties decide the course of action to be taken. They 
will have to decide whether to withdraw once and for all from 
the interparty talks because the Colorado Party failed to honor 
its promise to request the annulment of Article 2, not of the 
entire law. [passage omitted] 
  The PLRA, PDC, and PRF members are already discussing the 
possibility of forming a united opposition front to decisively 
support the transition process to democracy. They believe 
President Wasmosy is now lacking adequate political support 
because even the Colorado Party executive board has made a 
proposal that contradicts the president's decision. [passage 
omitted] 
  The PRF yesterday issued an official communique to state its 
position on the governability pact. The PRF announces that it 
is withdrawing its representatives from the interparty board in 
protest over the Colorado Party petition that the law 
temporarily suspending the party memberships of military and 
police officers on active duty be declared unconstitutional. 
  The communique adds that the PRF categorically rejects the 
duplicity observed in the Colorado party's political actions 
because, on the one hand, it committed itself to 
institutionalizing the Armed Forces and the Police, but on the 
other, it is revealing its regressive goal of attempting to 
revive the nefarious practice of identifying the party with the 
state and with the Armed Forces, a concept which is absolutely 
totalitarian and which we thought had been eradicated.

  [Excerpt] The Senate this morning approved the Washington 
protocol which establishes sanctions against governments 
installed through illegal means. The protocol has been adopted 
by the foreign ministers of OAS country members on behalf of 
their governments. 
  The document sent by the executive branch to the Senate on 
13 
May refers to a modification to the OAS charter. It adds rules 
to protect democratically elected administrations and sanctions 
against those that illegally oust their governors. 
  The senators unanimously approved the protocol. Senator 
Carlos Alberto Gonzalez, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee, 
later emphasized its importance. 
  One sanction contemplated in the document states that 
illegal 
administrations cannot participate in OAS meetings. 
  The Senate also agreed to the executive branch appointment 
of 
Ruben Bareiro Saguier as plenipotentiary ambassador to France.

yesterday. He wants to run for ANR [National Republican

note delivered to President Juan Carlos Wasmosy at the 
Presidential Palace, Fernandez says the Colorado Party "now must

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Jun (DPA) -- A group of 
Colombian and Panamanian ham operators today "saved" a group of 
Cubans who were fleeing their country aboard a boat that was 
attacked by seamen of Fidel Castro's regime, privately owned 
Radio Caracol has reported. 
  According to the radio station, which cited Colombian ham 
operator Jorge Villa, "they monitored the call for help on a 
shortwave frequency from a group of Cubans when the boat in 
which they were escaping was attacked by a Cuban gunboat." 
  The ham operators immediately contacted a U.S. military 
base, 
explained what had happened, and gave the location of the Cubans 
who were quickly aided by a Coast Guard vessel and two 
helicopters. The attacking gunboat returned to its Cuban base, 
the Caracol report states, citing the ham operators. 
  The boat was carrying approximately 70 Cuban refugees who 
decided to flee to the United States. The report does not 
indicate the final destination of the Cubans or their identities.

  [Text] Havana, 5 Jun (AFP) -- By Saturday night, Cuban 
authorities have still not confirmed reports from the United 
States that 61 Cuban refugees, fleeing Cuba by boat, were 
attacked by Cuban naval vessels, which resulted in the injury of 
seven people. 
  The official Cuban press has still not released any 
information on this new incident, which took place at the same 
time 124 Cubans occupy the Belgian ambassador's residence in 
Havana. 
  According to the passengers rescued south of Florida on 
Saturday by the U.S. Coast Guard, their boat was chased by Cuban 
military vessels following their departure from Mariel (40 km 
west of Havana), and they were fired upon. 
  A coast guard spokesman had not confirmed by Saturday night 
the origin of the shots, stating only that 61 Cubans had been 
rescued from sea and that seven were wounded, four by gunshots.

  [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (EFE) -- The fact that the 124 people 
who have entered the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana 
apparently refuse to leave has led to a deadlock in the 
conflict. In addition, two or three other persons entered the 
residence today, diplomatic sources told EFE. 
  One of the Belgian officials told foreign journalists that 
he 
could "neither confirm nor deny" the report on the persons' 
entry. Several witnesses, however, said the people slipped into 
the building from neighboring houses' yards despite the presence 
of dozens of Cuban plainclothes and uniformed police. Three 
people left the house on Thursday. According to a report that 
the other would-be refugees filtered to the press, these people 
could be state security agents. 
  Serafin Rodriguez, director of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's 
Europe Department, told EFE that the local authorities still do 
not have a list of the refugees, "which could be useful for many 
things, even to alert the ambassador, if necessary, about some 
of the people inside the building." 
  Rodriguez said that a few days ago, the Belgian Government 
mentioned to the Cuban Government the possibility of sending in 
reinforcements to its four-person delegation in Havana. These 
reinforcements would include diplomats and technicians. "We 
accepted," Rodriguez said. 
  On Thursday in Brussels, a spokesman reported that the 
authorities consider sending a small contingent of police -- not 
more than five -- to keep order in the interior of the 
ambassador's residence. 
  Rodriguez said Cuban Foreign Ministry officials, Belgian 
Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch, and special envoy Willy Verriest 
have continued to talk and that the two sides agree that the 
occupants must leave. "The problem lies in getting them out," he 
said. 
  Rodriguez said Cuba has "guaranteed in writing" that these 
people will not be tried for the occupation of the embassy 
building and that the offense "will not constitute aggravating 
circumstances in eventual trials." 
  The fact that they created, inside the occupied residence, 
an 
organization, the Union of Cubans for Freedom, does not help, 
Rodriguez said, but he added that this is something that 
requires further study. Diplomatic sources commented that the 
Belgians perhaps should "apply some more heat and pressure" on 
the refugees to persuade them to leave the embassy.

  [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Diplomatic sources have 
disclosed that two more Cubans entered the occupied residence of 
the Belgian ambassador in Havana at dawn today. 
  With the new arrivals, the number of occupiers has risen to 
124; they have been at the embassy since 28 May demanding 
permits to leave the country. 
  The sources refrained from specifying how the two new 
arrivals entered the residence, which is surrounded by dozens of 
policemen from the National Revolutionary Police (PNR) and state 
security agents dressed in civilian attire. 
  Today, Willy Verriest, the Belgian Government envoy, 
Ambassador Paul Vermiersch, and Foreign Ministry officials 
examined the "technical aspects of the measures that will be 
adopted to facilitate a final solution" to the problem, 
according to the state-owned news agency PRENSA LATINA.

<F P=106> [Article by Stella van Rijn: "Entire Curacao Island </F>
Executive Council Resigns -- Dissatisfaction in Liberia-Peters' 
Party Leads To Conflict"] 
  [Text] Curacao's entire Island Executive Council has 
resigned. All the deputies tendered their resignation yesterday 
[2 Jun] because they were in danger of losing majority support 
in the Island Council. The biggest party, the PNP [National 
People's Party] of former Prime Minister Liberia-Peters, will 
now try to form a new coalition. 
  Formally Curacao's Island Executive Council fell over an 
education issue. The deputee responsible for education wanted 
to expand the size of classes to 36 pupils in order to save 
money. However, there was considerable opposition to this 
measure within the education system and the trade unions. Three 
PNP members also threatened to vote against the proposal, which 
would have ended the coalition's majority in the Island Council. 
The deputees resigned before things reached this point. 
However, the real problem is primarily a party political 
affair. By voting against the measure, the three dissident PNP 
members wanted to express their dissatisfaction. After its 
defeat in the recent parliamentary elections, the PNP is in the 
middle of large-scale party reorganization. The three Island 
Council members would no longer be included on the PNP's list of 
candidates in next year's elections for a new Island Council. 
An attempt by the PNP leadership to talk with the dissidents 
has failed. They are now keeping their seats in their own names. 
  At present the PNP has seven seats. It is looking to work 
with its present coalition partner, the Democratic Party, and 
with the MAN [New Antilles Movement] opposition party. Early 
elections for the Island Council are legally impossible. The 
next elections are scheduled for April. 
  The Antillean Prime Minister Pourier has reacted with 
disappointment to the Island Executive Council's resignation. 
He was afraid that it would hamper the negotiations with 
Venezuela on the further existence of the refinery. "That is a 
crucial point about which we must reach agreement before the end 
of the month. The refinery is of national importance," Pourier 
said. Economic Affairs Minister Mendes had a different view. 
"The government does not have an outgoing status," he said. 
"We will continue to exercise our duties until a new coalition 
is formed."

  [Text] Managua, 3 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Leal today ruled out the possibility that the 
visit by two U.S. legislators is aimed at pressuring the 
Nicaraguan Government into returning the properties confiscated 
from U.S. citizens during the last decade. "We do not regard 
this visit as a form of pressure. We like people to come and see 
what happens in Nicaragua," Leal said in reference to the 
five-day visit of U.S. Representatives Robert Torricelli and 
Cass Ballenger. 
  According to a Foreign Ministry note, Torricelli and 
Ballenger arrived in Nicaragua "to learn about progress on 
property ownership, human rights, security of the people, and 
the economic and political situation in general." 
  Torricelli, the Democratic representative for New Jersey, 
said upon arriving in Managua the return to U.S. citizens of 
properties confiscated in the last decade "is a necessary factor 
for the continuance of aid for Nicaragua." 
  The U.S. Congress approved an amendment on 29 April imposing 
restrictions on U.S. financial aid for countries where 
properties of U.S. citizens have been confiscated, if the 
necessary steps for the resolution of this situation are not 
taken within a 90-day deadline. 
  Leal said these restrictions do not apply to Nicaragua, 
because, he said, the amendment applies only to countries that 
lack mechanisms to settle the claims of U.S. citizens. 
According to Leal, Nicaragua has started to return or make 
compensation for the real estate confiscated from both 
Nicaraguans and foreigners since 1991. 
  According to the U.S. Embassy in Managua, 600 U.S. citizens 
demand the return of more than 1,000 properties. The government 
of President Violeta Chamorro argues, however, that most of 
these individuals had adopted Nicaraguan citizenship prior to 
the time their properties were seized. 
  The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has reported that 125 U.S. 
citizens are demanding the return of 412 properties and that the 
difference between these figures and those provided by the U.S. 
Embassy consists of Nicaraguans who had assumed U.S. citizenship.

  [Excerpt] The government is studying a U.S. request to 
permit the arrival of Haitian refugees into national territory, 
even though no official position has been adopted on this issue, 
according to President Guillermo Endara. 
  Endara said that, traditionally, Panama has received 
refugees 
of various nationalities and that it is even common to see 
people jump into Panama Canal waters to ask for asylum. 
  The president said there is no official position yet, but 
the 
request made by the U.S. Government will be properly considered.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Ministry of the Army purchased 112 
portable Igla anti-aircraft missiles and 56 launchers from 
Russia on 31 May. This type of missile is used by ground 
soldiers to shoot down low-flying planes and helicopters. The 
Army said the missiles are 100 percent efficient. 
  According to General Gilberto Serra, head of the Army Social 
Communications Center (Cecomsex), the Army used part of the $100 
million it has allocated to purchase Russian armaments to 
purchase the missiles. 
  "We purchased the missiles because it was good business. We 
are conducting studies to manufacture them locally, but it takes 
a country 10 years to develop the appropriate technology for 
that type of equipment", the general said. 
  Serra said this is the first time Brazil has purchased 
weapons in Russia. The deal was made possible thanks to an 
agreement signed between the Industry and Commerce Ministry and 
the Russian Federation providing for the import and export of 
the most diverse kinds of products manufactured in the two 
countries. 
  In the next four years the trade exchange between Brazil and 
Russia should reach $2 billion. 
  The Army General Staff is analyzing what other kinds of 
military equipment could be purchased in Russia with the 
remaining $100 million allocated to the Army by that 
international trade agreement. 
  "Our interest is in purchasing as much as possible with as 
little money as possible. The Igla missile has already been 
tested under battle conditions, and it is one of the most modern 
in the world," Gen. Serra said. 
  Negotiations between the Brazilian Army and the Russian 
weapon industries started in September of last year, when 
Minister Zenildo de Lucena visited Russia. 
  The Army informed Armed Forces members about the purchase of 
the 112 anti-aircraft missiles and 56 launchers on 27 May. Each 
missile is 1.68 meters in length, and missile and launcher 
together weigh 18 kg.

<F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico 
will not be used as a springboard for exports of other nations. 
Investments and production must be in the country. Here is a 
report by Jaime Guerrero. 
  [Begin recording] [Guerrero] For the federal government, 
there is no alternative. Either one invests and produces in 
Mexico or the products of other countries will not be able to 
enter the North American free trade zone. President Salinas 
clearly stated that our country will not be a mere springboard 
for other nations to export to the United States. 
  [Salinas] That is why these investments, especially German 
investments, are taking place now so as to take advantage of 
that opportunity, which the treaty has opened and which in fact 
means more jobs for our fellow countrymen. 
  [Guerrero] The president spoke after inaugurating the first 
industrial complex of auto parts in Puebla. The inauguration 
came during his tour dealing with electricity services. In the 
past six years, the electric power generating capacity increased 
more than 35 percent. This is equivalent to supplying the 
Federal District and Mexico, Nuevo Leon, and Puebla States with 
electricity. In short, electric power service in the country is 
guaranteed. 
  [Salinas] Without sufficient electric power, the foundations 
for additional economic growth for Mexico could not have been 
laid. 
  [Guerrero] Salinas inaugurated the San Lorenzo Almecatla 
electricity substation in Puebla. Afterwards, in Guerrero 
State, he inaugurated the Presidente Plutarco Elias Calles 
thermoelectric plant. It is the biggest in Latin America and 
represents an investment of $2.5 billion. In this tour, 
President Salinas inaugurated three infrastructure projects 
which received investments from three different countries. 
  [Salinas] We do not depend on either a single market or a 
single investor. 
  [Guerrero] The results of this administration in the area of 
electricity service are positive. Twenty-one million Mexicans 
began receiving service and by the end of the government's 
six-year term, 95 percent of the population will have 
electricity. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Ivan Castro from the "AM/PM" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Despite the announcement that Colombia will no 
longer receive information from them, the gringo radars in our 
country are still functioning, and it is not yet known whether 
they will be dismantled. Many questions have been raised 
concerning the issue. 
  According to a bulletin released by the Colombian Air Force, 
the order issued unilaterally on 1 May by the U.S. Defense 
Department called for the suspension of satellite transmissions 
of the information obtained from the radars at the Air Force's 
control center. There has been no mention of plans to dismantle 
the tracking equipment or to continue supplying information to 
the gringo government. 
  A confidential source informed "AM/PM" that the radars are 
still being operated by U.S. personnel and that, in response to 
Colombia's request that the equipment be dismantled, the Defense 
Department requested a deadline of three months when the job can 
be done within a maximum of 10 days. 
  The United States has decided to stop providing Colombia 
with 
information because it believes that Colombia has violated 
several international agreements by ordering attacks on strange 
airplanes, as strange as the gringo military airplanes that 
frequently fly over Colombian territory without permission. 
  An official decision is still expected from the two 
governments with regard to this situation, which is just another 
case of the Gaviria administration's confusing and mysterious 
international policy.

  [Text] The Herraraist faction of the National Party has 
questioned the legitimacy of the Sanguinetti administration, 
which was placed in power through the 1984 elections. In a 
document evaluating the current administration's actions in 
government, the Herreraist faction characterizes this 
administration "as the first elected without restrictions" since 
the military regime. 
  The document points out the main achievements of the 
administration headed by Luis Alberto Lacalle, emphasizing the 
"transformations and changes in concepts, the economic and 
social achievements, and the most incomparable and far-reaching 
social work of the past few decades." The document also states 
that "we want neither an all-encompassing nor an absentee 
government." 
  The report, distributed among Herreraist constituents, 
describes the government as having "concluded the transition 
period that began with the 1984 elections, which were carried 
out with exclusions (...) The Herreraist government was the 
first to be elected without restrictions following the de facto 
regimes." 
  The document mentions the attitude of current administration 
employees, especially their "firm, prudent, and clear conduct in 
attaining national goals, without demagoguery or a desire for 
political gain; their respect for the law and the Constitution; 
and their search for a consensus in resolving state problems in 
the most important areas of national life." 
  The document mentions the basic actions of government. It 
mentions the following economic achievements: "balanced public 
finances; clear and reliable exchange and monetary policies; 
inflation is being fought against; public and private financial 
institutions are operating within the rules and controls that 
generate trust in the financial system; tax evasion and 
organized smuggling are being decidedly engaged; and the 
encouragement of productive retooling, which is being promoted 
by private initiative." 
  In the area of labor relations, the document points out that 
"management and workers negotiate collective agreements without 
the state's participation. Nevertheless, the state has greatly 
supported collective bargaining. The concept of productivity has 
been incorporated into labor relations, giving rise to new forms 
of relationships between companies and their employees. Private 
and government-owned enterprises work out far-reaching 
collective agreements that ensure peaceful labor relations. The 
official banking sector programmed and enforced the equalization 
of salaries with the private sector." 
  With regard to agriculture, the report underlines the 
reduction of tariffs on the importation of capital goods, the 
elimination of the tax on the National Silo Fund, (and) the 
reduction of the Imesi [specific domestic tax] levied on the 
sale of diesel oil, which has led to a drop in the price of this 
type of fuel." 
  The document moreover counts "the eradication of 
foot-and-mouth disease" and "the strengthening of agricultural 
research" as achievements. 
  It also underscores the attainments in the area of tourism, 
noting that "the objectives that were established have been 
greatly surpassed, as our 1995 goal of 2 million visitors was 
met in 1993. It is estimated that Uruguay will meet the target 
of 3 million tourists per year by the year 2000." 
  The tract enumerates the laws proposed by the government 
which it labels "revolutionary laws." 
  It mentions the process of the so-called "law on 
government-owned enterprises," including its "partial" 
abolishment following the plebiscite held on 13 December 1992. 
  The document contends that pursuant to the provisions of 
this 
law that remain in effect, the executive branch "liquidated ILPE 
[State Seal and Fishing Industry], and implemented the necessary 
mechanisms to allow private capital to buy a share in Pluna 
[Uruguayan National Airlines]." 
  It then mentions such achievements as the reform of the port 
administration system, the end of the insurance monopoly, and 
the elimination of red tape through the National 
Debureaucratization Program (Pronade)." 
  The document highlights the work done in the area of 
housing. 
The Uruguayan Mortgage Bank constructed 10,057 homes between 
1990 and 1993, and granted 7,280 personal loans.

  [Text] Economy Minister Ignacio De Posadas has described 
the promises by presidential candidates in Bella Union about 
helping the economic recovery of sugar-producing farmers as 
"cheap and lying demagoguery." 
  In a clear reference to [Former President] Julio Maria 
Sanguinetti and [Montevideo Mayor] Tabare Vazquez, whose names 
he did not mention, De Posadas said the promises they made 
regarding subsidies "are cheap and lying demagoguery because 
neither of them has the slightest intention of fulfilling their 
promises." 
  Speaking on the radio program "New Time for Everyone," De 
Posadas said "the development of the sugar industry in 
Uruguay...is irreversible and those who made those promises to 
the Bella Union people are lying." 
  Sanguinetti and Tabare Vazquez visited Bella Union and 
questioned the government policy. De Posadas said: "One of them 
is new to lying. The other is older but, despite the promises he 
made in Bella Union to help the sugar cane producers and sugar 
industry, during his administration he allowed the sugar beet 
industry to collapse without implementing any measures. One must 
remember this." 
  Ignacio De Posadas spoke about the university conflict, 
saying it is being "politicized, radicalized, and lied about." 
  He questioned the "unrealistic terms" with which salary 
demands are being made. He said: "If the 6-percent wage 
increase authorized by Congress is granted, or if any other 
increase is granted, the quality of Uruguayan education will 
remain exactly the same." 
  De Posadas said that while students showed great imagination 
in their marches and their demonstrations, "they filed away the 
deans' university reform proposals, thus avoiding a discussion 
on their future. No effort is being made to really solve the 
problem."

<F P=106> [By Vicenter Briceno from the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Central Information Office Minister Guillermo 
Alvarez Bajares today downplayed the suggestion by (Rutillier 
Orloge), adviser to the IMF, the United Nations, and the World 
Bank, that the government freeze prices, salaries, and the 
exchange rate for two months. 
  Alvarez said the expert's recommendation contradicts the 
economic policy of President Rafael Caldera as well as the 
economic policy of private economic organizations, such as the 
Higher Institute of Administration Studies, Iesa, and the 
Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce, Venamcham. The adviser 
participated in the forum: "Post-Sosa Plan Alternatives for 
Venezuela," where he said that President Caldera should adopt 
these measures, otherwise, the crisis will deepen and [words 
indistinct] stabilization in a more radical manner. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez] That is the center of the 
economic opposition to the current government. It seems that the 
man went [words indistinct] rope at the house of the hanged. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] all economic proposals of.... 
  [Alvarez, interrupting] No, quite the opposite; it disagrees 
with sectors of the private economy. 
  [Reporter] I meant the government's economic policy. 
  [Alvarez] The government's economic policy is absolutely 
independent from what Mr. [name indistinct], the IMF, Venamcham, 
and Iesa might say. Absolutely different. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] break from IMF? 
  [Alvarez] No, perhaps a break between the IMF and Iesa and 
Venamcham. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Hugo Sergio del Aguila] </F>
  [Text] Caracas, 2 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera will ask his colleagues, who will participate in 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to seek urgent solutions for 
the demands of millions of poor people in the region, Foreign 
Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said today. 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said the Ibero-American 
Summit will be a good opportunity to find solutions "for social 
disorders and urban overcrowding," which have become common and 
serious problems for Latin America and the Caribbean. "Latin 
America and the Caribbean have common problems such as poverty, 
social disorders, and overcrowded cities because of people 
moving in from the countryside and becoming disorderly masses," 
Burelli said. 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the foreign minister said 
Venezuela regrets to see that the development of the last few 
decades has not kept man as its center of attention with his 
various needs, such as education, health, food, and housing. 
  He confirmed that President Caldera will participate in the 
summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June, 
which will be attended by 21 heads of state and government, 
including Spain and Portugal, because "Venezuela will fulfill 
its obligation once again." It will be Caldera's first trip 
abroad since he was sworn in on 2 February. 
  According to the Venezuelan foreign minister, Ibero-American 
summits are of great importance far beyond their agenda points, 
because of the opportunities they represent and because they 
provide a greater awareness of reality. "The Ibero-American 
Summit will also be a good opportunity--without ruling out other 
forums such as the OAS--to clearly establish the desire to give 
greater importance to human development," Burelli said. 
  The minister said work is still being done on the summit's 
agenda, but noted that, in addition to the discussion of social 
problems, it is necessary to discuss "the Haitian tragedy, one 
of the most difficult topics because of its lack of solutions." 
  He said it is important to "exchange ideas" about the Summit 
of the Americas convened by U.S. President William Clinton for 
Miami, Florida to which all countries of the hemisphere have 
been invited, except Cuba. According to Burelli, the Miami 
meeting will be an opportunity for Latin America to talk to the 
United States about topics of extreme importance to the region. 
  Venezuela will reiterate at the forum the proposal it made 
during the recent Rio Group Summit in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on the 
urgent need to create an instrument to fight corruption, such as 
drug trafficking, in a drastic and expeditious manner. The 
foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan proposal 
coincides with a law being drafted by the Ecuadoran Government 
to curb influence-peddling and corruption. "We seek to merge 
both initiatives so as to propose an agile and useful instrument 
to stop the wave of corruption in our countries," he said. 
Burelli said we must take advantage of the Ibero-American 
Summit and other forums to insist on this serious problem 
because democracy "must involve proven honesty." 
  As for the topic of continental security, the foreign 
minister pointed out that, in view of the failure of the 
Inter-American Security System, which was dismantled following 
the Islas Malvinas War [Falkland Islands War], a mechanism to 
detect elements of destabilization and insecurity in the region 
is necessary. "There are sufficient reasons to undertake an 
Ibero-American action on the security issue. Some of these 
reasons include drug trafficking, guerrillas, extreme poverty, 
human rights violations, hunger, and injustice," he said. 
  According to Burelli, the agenda for the Ibero-American 
Summit will include topics such as culture, education, and the 
exchange of technology as a mechanism to free ourselves from our 
dependence on huge industrial centers. "We are going to seek 
mechanisms that can allow universities and industries at a 
hemispheric level to make innovations that can contribute to the 
reduction of the high costs of social development," Burelli said. 
  The minister reiterated the importance of the so-called 
Group 
of Three's (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) signing an 
agreement to create a free trade zone, which is to take place in 
Cartagena de Indias on 13 June. Burelli said the trade 
agreement, which will open up a market of 245 million potential 
consumers with a gross regional product of $370 billion, will 
greatly contribute to the regional integration process and will 
promote the economic development of the region.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Announcer] According to Finance Minister Julio 
Sosa Rodriguez, the government will definitely increase the 
price of gasoline by the end of 1994. This measure will be 
implemented progressively to prevent adverse effects on the 
collective transportation system. According to budget estimates 
for 1995, this increase will reach an average of 12 bolivares. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] This statement was made by 
Finance Minister Sosa Rodriguez during the forum: "How to Have 
Confidence in Venezuela." Sosa Rodriguez confirmed that on 
several occasions, the need to increase the prices of 
hydrocarbons had been discussed. However, this increase will 
have to be implemented after a register of vehicles used for 
collective transportation is drafted so that any possible 
problems are averted. He added that revenues earned from such an 
increase have not been calculated yet. 
  [Sosa Rodriguez] I have said it about three or four times. 
We 
need to make a register of all vehicles used for collective 
transportation. I have said that eventually, the collective 
transportation sector must receive a subsidy so that whenever 
the increase is implemented--probably by the end of this 
year--this sector, which is widely used by the population, will 
not be adversely affected. 
  [Reporter] Sosa Rodriguez also indicated the fiscal deficit 
has been reduced since 12 February from 650 billion bolivares to 
a current 120 billion bolivares. This signifies an 80-percent 
reduction or the equivalent of 12 percent of the GDP. He added 
that after May and June, additional price increases will not be 
justifiable. He reiterated that estimates predict inflation 
figures of 50 percent for the end of 1994 and 25 percent for 
1995. As for the exchange rate, he said the true rate varies 
between 140 and 145 bolivares. 
  [Reporter] Nevertheless, the country's leading labor 
organization hopes to learn more about the government plans in 
this regard since past experience shows that increases in 
gasoline prices are accompanied by discontent and inflation. 
  [Jose Beltran Vallejo, president of the Confederation of 
Venezuelan Workers] We have some documents and problems we will 
be submitting to the government very soon. We have told them 
that people cannot continue paying for the crisis. [passage 
omitted] [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Senate Energy 
and Mines committee, expressed his agreement with the increase 
in gasoline prices. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Valle Valle believes this 
increase is fundamental because the oil sector cannot continue 
registering low profit margins. 
  [Valle Valle] Gasoline profit margins are negative, which 
means costs are greater than revenues. This situation cannot 
continue in an organization such as Petroven and its 
subsidiaries. Petroven is a business and no business exists to 
generate losses. In addition, Petroven has the responsibility of 
generating greater benefits than other companies in order to 
fulfill the needs of the productive and social sectors of the 
country. [end recording] [passsage omitted]

  [Text] Edgar Valle Valle, chairman of the Oil, Energy, and 
Mine Subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, has endorsed the 
increase in gasoline prices, saying it is no longer possible to 
continue registering losses in the profit margin of the oil 
sector. Convergence Senator Luis Ramon Matos did not agree, 
saying this is not the opportune time to announce an increase. 
He has said the country is experiencing a devaluation of the 
bolivar, a rise in speculation, price increases, and a 
deterioration in the mass transit system, all of which make 
difficult the acceptance of this decision. 
  According to Consecomercio [National Council of Commerce and 
Services] President Berend Roosen, the reduction in the price of 
the dollar does not entail a reduction in products of mass 
consumption, because most of the raw materials have already been 
imported. He has added a study is being conducted on suggested 
top retail prices to achieve stability between merchants and 
customers. Roosen has recalled that due to the dollar's 
stability, the internal market has been restocked.

<F P=106> [Article by Ana Diaz] </F>
  [Text] Russia hopes shortly to renew a trilateral trade 
agreement with Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. [Petroven] to supply 
oil to Cuba. Through this agreement Russia will supply up to 
70,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the European market, and 
Petroven will supply an equal amount to the Caribbean island. 
Under a similar agreement, which was suspended in 1992, Russia 
and Venezuela saved $1 per barrel in freight expenses. 
  Russia supplied Ural crude to the Ruhr Oel refinery system, 
a 
Veba Oel and Petroven company, in Germany, while Petroven 
supplied Cuba with reconstituted crude. Vitali Zeleakin, 
president of the Committee for Economic Reform of the Russian 
Federation Council, and Vladimir Turdenev, Russian Foreign 
Ministry director for Central and South America, said that only 
a few technical aspects remain to be resolved before deliveries 
to Europe and Cuba can resume. The two officials said that, far 
from reflecting ideological positions, this is basically a trade 
agreement beneficial to the two parties. Currently, Russia 
trades 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of Cuban sugar. 
  A delegation of Russian parliamentarians is visiting 
Venezuela this week. They have expressed the political desire of 
the federation of republics to strengthen bilateral relations in 
areas such as oil. Yesterday they held meetings with Energy and 
Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta and Petroven President Luis Giusti. 
  Another interesting Russian proposal regards their 
willingness to cooperate with OPEC. Russia is considering 
joining OPEC because it considers the organization an important 
agent in maintaining market stability. Moreover, the Russians 
offer the possibility of exchanging mining and petroleum 
technology with Venezuela. 
  Russia is of interest as an oil-producing country despite 
the 
sharp drop in its established production capacity of 12 million 
barrels per day in the 1970's to 7 million barrels per day at 
present, a volume which it wants to increase by opening the 
market to national and foreign private investors.

<F P=106> [Article by Argenis Bravo: "$500 Million To Modernize FAN"] </F>
  [Excerpts] With the Umbrella Law [Ley Paraguas] which 
allocates resources to the Armed Forces, weapons systems will be 
modernized. This modernization includes the upgrading of Missile 
Frigates, the French-made AMX-30 tanks, and the purchase and 
replacement of equipment for the Venezuelan Air Force [FAV] and 
the National Guard [GN]. The allocation amounts to some $500 
million or approximately 8 billion bolivares. 
  Vice Admiral Rafael Huize Claviel, inspector general of the 
National Armed Forces (FAN), made this announcement here 
yesterday. The FAN began their annual government inspection and 
supervision program for the operational readiness of Tactical 
Combat Units at the installations of the four military branches 
in Zulia State. With regard to the administrative aspect, the 
FAN also began a program to check infrastructure conditions in 
command posts, barracks, border vigilance posts, and assistance 
centers. 
  Huize Claviel was accompanied by a high-ranking delegation 
that included 10 top officers with the rank of colonel from the 
four military branches. These officers are also members of the 
inspection teams. GN Brigadier General Simon Jose Lunar Ortega, 
chief of the Inspector General's Office also accompanied 
Claviel. [passage omitted] 
  Claviel made statements to PANORAMA noting that the 
Inspector 
General's Office, within the framework of its annual activities, 
scheduled this inspection visit to the Zulia Garrison for today. 
A group of officers from this office are accompanying me to 
conduct an inspection of the garrison. The 1st Infantry Division 
commander will give me a report on matters he considers we 
should become aware of. I will take this report with me to 
Caracas, where I will try to find solutions to any problems. We 
will also visit such offices in this military division as the 
Center for Military Recruitment and the National Armed Forces 
Social Security Institute. I will also visit the four big 
commands that operate here beginning with the 1st Division. We 
already visited the General Rafael Urdaneta Air Base, BARU, and 
next, we will visit the GN Regional Command No. 3 and the 11th 
Army Infantry Brigade Regional Command. We will close our tour 
with a visit to the command post of the Pedro Lucas Urribarri 
Main Coast Guard Station. [passage omitted] 
  Adm. Huize Clavier stressed that with the Umbrella Law, the 
Armed Forces hope to obtain the necessary funds for the 
maintenance and modernization of its military equipment. He 
added that through the Umbrella Law, the Armed Forces have 
designed a development and consolidation program for which it 
will receive $500 million, which is equivalent to approximately 
8 billion bolivares to cover the Umbrella Law 93. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez] </F>
  [Text] A new Shining Path [SL] slogan is starting to appear 
on poor neighborhoods' walls: "An imprisoned Maoist is a dead 
Maoist." 
  This is the war cry of subversives who are against the "new 
and great definition" imparted from prison by Abimael Guzman 
Reinoso: "To struggle for the achievement of a Peace Accord." 
  This is a clash between the "Leftist Annihilation Line 
(LLI)" 
headed by Oscar Ramirez Durand, who is supported by the "cadres" 
(highly trained militants) who are not in prison, and the 
"Right-Wing Opportunist Line" (LOD), headed by Guzman, who is 
supported by the majority of SL members in prison. 
  LOD members were the first to propose an end to the armed 
struggle in view of the severe blows sustained by the party 
leadership and of the need to end the bloodbath. 
  Guzman has decided to hold a second SL congress so the "new 
and great decision" will be adopted by all combatants to thus 
recover party authority and avoid internal party divisions. 
  Ramirez Durand, however, has not remained idle. 
  In February, LLI members were able to get the SL Central 
Committee to hold a meeting in Ayacucho. They were not only able 
to restructure the main party leadership organization with 
acting members elected during the first congress in 1988 but 
also ousted Guzman and all of his close advisers from the 
organization by adopting the following agreements: 
  A) Neither the war nor the party can be led from prison 
because combatants behind bars are inoperative and disconnected 
from reality. This is the reason for adopting the slogan: "An 
imprisoned Maoist is a dead Maoist." 
  B) Those who favor a peace agreement are violating basic 
Marxist-Leninist-Maoist principles, particularly the "Gonzalo 
Thought" principles, and, therefore, isolating themselves and, 
by their own initiative, deserting the party. 
  They also reasserted an agreement already approved during 
two 
other previous high-ranking meetings (Central Committee "working 
sessions" of a "resolutory nature" in December 1992 and August 
1993) that obviously were not attended by Guzman: to continue 
"the people's war." 
  Public attention is again centered on those SL members out 
of 
prison headed by Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," because of 
recent terrorist actions (car bombs, an "armed stoppage," an 
attack on a section of the oil pipeline, and armed propaganda). 
  Since the disclosure of Guzman's letters to President 
Alberto 
Fujimori and details on the peace agreement negotiations, the 
government has only disclosed details on the movements of 
Guzman's faction and its leaders but has concealed the reactions 
of Maoists out of prison regarding the conduct of their 
"leadership and authority." 
  It is now known that LLI members, also known by their LOD 
enemies as "traitors" and "military goons," did not resign 
themselves to accepting Guzman's capitulation. They allege that 
the videos are a sham, the letters false, and the agreement a 
hoax with the ultimate objective of assassinating "President 
Gonzalo" and destroying the armed struggle. With this excuse, 
they proceeded to restructure the entire party apparatus. They 
have filled vacant posts left by their leaders and dead or 
imprisoned "cadres" and resumed the implementation of plans 
approved by Guzman at the Third Central Committee Plenum meeting 
in August 1992, just a few weeks before his arrest. 
  That is why the government strategy of strengthening the 
leadership of Guzman and the arrested Central Committee members 
and presenting them as the real SL representatives (recent 
intelligence reports recommend breaking the isolation of Guzman 
and his aides, allowing them to visit other inmates or vice 
versa to allow them to intensify their propaganda campaign to 
promote a split in the SL organization) will have to be 
reconsidered given that the organization has begun to be 
represented by the LLI. 
  To begin with, the government must resume the talks, which 
have been paralyzed for the past seven months according to LOD 
leaflets. Guzman needs new arguments to attract a new 
public--the "glorious combat trenches" and the inoperative 
militants currently have very little or no influence on the 
course of the war--because the same speech for imprisoned SL 
members and those who are operational outside has not yielded 
results. 
  Statements like "a golden page was turned with the people's 
war; we are now beginning a stage of bloodless war that means 
politics without bloodshed; a bloody war is politics with 
bloodshed," can affect an SL member burdened by the humiliating 
prospect of being able to enjoy sunlight for only 30 minutes a 
day for the rest of his life. Such statements do not have the 
same effect on a "military commander" who, for example, conducts 
a column and has seen his subordinates fall precisely in the 
name of the "people's war" that, according to Guzman's new 
position, does not mean "giving up or abandoning the revolution 
but to continue fighting our new conditions." They also will 
have no effect on an Upper Huallaga column that lives from the 
"protection money" it charges drug traffickers. 
  The deadlock of the talks between the government 
representatives and the imprisoned SL spokesmen can be explained 
by the conditions demanded by the SL, which have annoyed 
President Fujimori, who said the only result he expects from the 
agreement is "unconditional surrender." 
  LA REPUBLICA had access to the documents the SL members 
circulate inside the prisons, which contain 15 points divided 
into four sections as an "introduction" and 11 other points 
listed as "basic proposals." 
  These "guidelines for basic documents," that is, the 
Maoists' 
expectations of the benefits they expect to obtain after laying 
down their weapons, do not correspond at all to an 
"unconditional surrender." 
  By granting the following concessions: "To cease the 
people's 
war that began on 17 May 1980 in its four wartime expressions of 
guerrilla actions (selective annihilation, sabotage, political 
agitation, and armed propaganda and guerrilla warfare), to 
self-dissolve the People's Guerrilla Army, to destroy their 
weapons and combat means, and also to dissolve the Popular and 
Grass-Roots Committees that support the RPND [Republica Popular 
de Nueva Democracia--New Democracy People's Republic]," Guzman 
intends to obtain: 
  A) the end of antisubversive operations by security forces; 
  B) the release of all the men and women accused or sentenced 
for terrorist actions and the improvement of the prison 
conditions as long as the release process lasts; 
  C) ending all trials for terrorist crimes; the opening of 
new 
court proceedings; and the nullification of all subpoenas and 
arrest warrants submitted against combatants, collaborators, and 
sympathizers both in Peru and abroad; 
  D) ending the government campaign "conducted in the country 
and abroad against the people's war, the party, and its members 
and sympathizers"; 
  E) reinstating the legal status of SL members, including 
those living abroad; 
  F) returning the SL "museum" seized from Abimael Guzman in 
1990, including the video in which he is seen dancing a Greek 
dance and the books from his personal library; 
  G) allowing an "honorable" burial for Augusta La Torre 
Carrasco, "Comrade Norah," whose body currently is buried in a 
secret tomb; 
  H) promulgating a general amnesty law "that will reconcile 
the nation, without victors or vanquished, without reprisals or 
shame"; 
  Pardoning all SL members, releasing them from jail, and 
letting them go free is not exactly what the government had in 
mind with Guzman's surrender, particularly because he does not 
believe this agreement is tantamount to a defeat or a surrender 
but "a period between an end of a stage in the International 
Proletariat Revolution and the future Great Wave itself. This 
justifies the general political withdrawal. We have started to 
manage the general military withdrawal as a result of the 
general political withdrawal, which is complex and difficult but 
necessary to develop other forms of struggle under new 
conditions." 
  Guzman and his followers simply believe that the people's 
war 
will continue but under different forms of struggle. These new 
forms of struggle will establish the conditions for the advent 
of that "future Great Wave." 
  At the other extreme there are Ramirez Durand and his 
people, 
who reasserted their leadership at the February Central 
Committee meeting, during which they achieved several agreements 
to guarantee the armed struggle's continuation. Some of them 
are: "To struggle to impose Maoism as the new, third, and 
superior stage of Marxism; to tenaciously combat imperialism, 
revisionism, and international reactionary movements; to 
reassert the principle of revolutionary violence as the 
universal law achieved during the people's war; to work among 
the masses in and for the people's war; to struggle to vindicate 
power; to incorporate the masses in the people's war; (and to 
organize) the arming of the masses." 
  The 14 years of armed struggle, therefore, are taking by 
surprise an organization whose combatants out of prison have 
started the reorganization of their party leadership and 
continues to implement a guerrilla campaign interrupted in view 
of the arrests that were made and that has isolated their 
"prisoners of war" (including Guzman and its Central Committee). 
They are considered nonoperational cadres unable to lead the 
party and the war. In view of this, the SL radical group has 
been able to describe the peace agreement as a desperate 
proposal made by combatants who find themselves pressured by the 
prospects of life imprisonment or, in the best of cases, who 
will be in jail for at least many decades. 
  Everything indicates that the government will continue to 
strengthen Guzman's authority and undermine Ramirez Durand's and 
his real power over the combatants out of prison. Under these 
circumstances, "Feliciano" will increase the levels of violence 
to obtain more attention and recover the war initiative. From 
now on, should antiterrorist forces ask whether or not they 
support the peace agreement when they arrest SL members? If 
they say they support it, should they let them go free? This is 
one of the several contradictions of the new course of the war. 
Before, a jailed Maoist was a key figure in the armed struggle, 
a fortunate member of a "luminous combat trench." Nowadays, to 
be jailed is tantamount to being buried alive. A jailed Maoist 
is the same as a dead Maoist. The dead have little or no 
influence on the war's course.

CSO 

    [Editorial Report] The monthly PERU ECONOMICO [PE], 
devoting its April issue to employment, said that employment 
policy will be the central issue in the 1995 presidential 
campaign, "no matter who the candidates are." The general public 
calls unemployment the greatest problem facing the nation today 
and is looking for a leader with solutions, according to PE. 
Apoyo-owned PE speculated that unemployment ranks higher than 
poverty because the solution to poverty is associated in the 
public mind with social welfare programs. Peruvians today 
"prefer a job with which to resolve the economic problems rather 
than a handout." In addition to the primary focus on 
unemployment, the composition of the presidential ticket will be 
"much more important" than in the past. (In 1990 outsider 
candidate Alberto Fujimori won the presidency on the strength of 
his antipolitics stance and his commitment to restore civil 
order by defeating the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac Amaru 
Revolutionary Movement.) PERU ECONOMICO predicted that the 
candidates will run short campaigns "in order to avoid 
overexposure." 
<H5>  Stymied Jobs Creation </H5>
  The labor reforms of recent years, which were intended to 
improve competitiveness by reducing wage regulations and doing 
away with collective bargaining have not led to any noticeable 
increase in jobs. The reforms also caused a drastic downsizing 
in the public sector: from 633,349 government employees in 1990 
to 338,428 in 1993. Nor is the export sector expected to 
generate any significant increase in jobs or wages in the 
future, according to the April PERU ECONOMICO. The situation is 
further exacerbated by the very large numbers of young people 
entering the job market each year. 
  The labor unions have lost much of their clout and many of 
their members as the reforms have encouraged individual 
contracting, short-term employment, and modifications in wage 
regulations with a system for compulsory saving. 
  The establishment of various mechanisms to reduce the cost 
of 
opening up new jobs, such as private pension funds and wage 
reform, has not gone smoothly and the program to finance housing 
(FOVI) has been suspended. Nor is there a timetable for starting 
up private health organizations. 

<H5>    Two Markets </H5>
  According to the same issue of PERU ECONOMICO, creating more 
flexible employer/employee relations and other "modernization" 
attempts are only a partial solution to unemployment and lack of 
competitiveness because the market has become divided into two 
disparate segments: a formal market where the workers are 
protected by labor laws and an informal market with no 
protection. There are great differences in qualifications, 
productivity, and wages in the two markets. In the informal 
market there is not much chance of full-time employment or 
upward mobility, nor is there any investment in human resources. 
  An expert consulted by PERU ECON0MICO is quoted as saying 
that the government's strategy to modernize the labor market 
will only affect the workers in "the most modern sector." They 
would benefit from compulsory savings programs which will in 
turn give them access to investment and credit. In the 
traditional market, improvements could only occur through 
increased foreign and domestic capital. The current reform does 
not ensure that the unemployed or those in low-paying jobs will 
benefit from economic growth. For that to happen there would 
have to be a skills-training policy and incentives to invest in 
human resources. 
<H5>  Employment Numbers </H5>
  PERU ECONOMTCO estimates that in metropolitan Lima the 
underemployed (earning $135 per month) constitute 53 percent, 
and those adequately employed ($341 per month) constitute 38 
percent of the economically active population. The Lima sectors 
with the greatest unemployment were mining (16 percent) and 
construction (13 percent). Sectors providing the most adequate 
employment were "nonpersonal services" (15 percent) and commerce 
(14 percent). Age did not appear to be a factor. 
<H5>  Poverty Rising </H5>
  The monthly PERUPAZ in its April issue decries the Fujimori 
government's failure to address the serious problem of poverty 
and says that in spite of the economic successes the government 
claims, its economic policy impedes any improvement in the 
quality of life for most Peruvians. There is a disconnect, the 
monthly contends, between Fujimori's economic policy and the 
country's social needs. In 1992 the GNP dropped by 5 percent 
from the preceding year to its lowest level in 15 years. 
  Studies by the Institute for Statistics and Data [INEI] show 
"critical poverty" to have reached 53 percent of the population 
by 1991, while "extreme poverty" rose to 21 percent. 
<H5>  Urban Poverty </H5>
  PERUPAZ says that "contrary to earlier decades," poverty now 
exists also in the urban areas, and in particular in Lima, where 
a full one-third of those in critical poverty live. 
  Thirty-three percent of the economically active population 
of 
Peru live in Lima. In 1989-1990 salaries and wages shrank by 13 
and 16.8 percent respectively. The downhill trend continued for 
the period 1990-1992: The number of underemployed went from 86.4 
to 88.1 percent of the population and the number of unemployed 
from 8.3 to 10 percent. 
  Nationally, underemployment decreased slightly--from 79 to 
76 
percent in 1991-1992, while unemployment went from 5.9 to 9.9 
percent. 
<H5>  Rural Poverty </H5>
  The majority of the poor live in the rural and mountain 
areas 
of the country where income is extremely low and there is rarely 
any access to basic health services, education, adequate 
nutrition, and sanitation. 
  The INEI study of 1991 showed that in the rural areas of the 
Sierra only 43 percent of the homes had drinking water (inside 
or outside), and only 14 percent had sewage. Thirty-one percent 
of the homes had electricity. 
<H5>  Diseases </H5>
  Diseases previously considered under control have reemerged: 
malaria, tuberculosis, cholera, facial ulcers. Mortality rates 
for children under the age of five did decline from 97 per 
thousand in 1978 to 76 per thousand in 1991 according to INEI, 
but Peru continues to have one of the highest infant mortality 
rates in South America. 
<H5>  Governability Questioned </H5>
  PERUPAZ concludes that the government has failed to address 
the problems of the poor, "who have become the majority." The 
periodical calls for a vigorous social policy and an economic 
policy congruent with the social necessities, saying that a key 
factor will be stimulating agricultural production. PERUPAZ 
warns that if the social issue is not addressed, it is "not 
optimistic about the outlook for governable conditions in Peru." 
<H5>  Steady Trend </H5>
  Opinion polls over the past several months done by Apoyo, 
Imasen, etc., have consistently shown former UN Secretary 
General Javier Perez de Cuellar leading President Alberto 
Fujimori in a two-way race, with the former enjoying greater 
support in the country's interior. The polls also consistently 
show that Fujimori would have a clear lead over the other 
frequently mentioned potential candidates, Lima Mayor Ricardo 
Belmont, former President Fernando Belaunde Terry, and former 
Arequipa Mayor Luis Caceres (to date, only Belmont has declared 
his candidacy). 
<H5>  Vice Presidential Factor </H5>
  In its April issue PERU ECONOMICO says the vice presidential 
candidates will be a significant factor: National Police 
Inspector General Antonio Ketin Vidal "could bring a lot of 
votes." (Vidal is credited with the October 1992 capture of SL 
founder and leader Abimael Guzman.) PE does not rule out a 
surprise candidate, much like Fujimori in 1990, and notes that 
there are other potential candidates, waiting for a "propitious 
opportunity," prominent among them former Prime Minister Juan 
Carlos Hurtado Miller. 
<H5>  Fujimori Versus de Cuellar </H5>
  PERU ECONOMICO concurs with the widely held view that Perez 
de Cuellar's strength is his international stature and his 
weakness is his decades-long absence from Peru. PE quotes an 
unnamed "leading" politician with "many victories" as saying 
"this product [de Cuellar] is not particularly marketable in the 
sierra." 
  Fujimori's strength, successfully controlling subversion and 
inflation, puts him in a "paradoxical situation" in that the 
public sees him as a successful president, but not as a good 
candidate. The country today has a sense of order; two years ago 
"no one would have predicted that Shining Path would today be in 
the process of disappearing," PE asserts. 
  Fujimori projects an authoritarian image and is perceived as 
lacking any vision "beyond establishing order," according to PE, 
which adds that the "general requirement" for more peaceful 
times will be a leader who carries on a dialogue and is a 
consensus builder. According to a poll published in the 
Apoyo-owned weekly 24 April SEMANA ECONOMICA, 64 percent of the 
interviewees believe the next president should be a consensus 
builder and only 29 percent want an authoritarian president. The 
number of respondents in the poll, conducted in Lima and "eight 
other cities" was not given. 
<H5>  April Apoyo Polls </H5>
  The April Apoyo polls published in PERU ECONOMICO showed 
that 
a majority thought Fujimori's "self-coup" of April 1992 had led 
to an improvement in the areas of terrorism, inflation, 
corruption, and narcotics trafficking. A majority believed that 
the nation's main problems are unemployment, poverty, nutrition, 
education, and cost of living. The poll was conducted in Lima 
and eight provincial capitals across socioeconomic groups. The 
number of respondents was not given. 
<H5>  Intelligence Service Poll </H5>
  According to the weekly Sl [2-8 May] citing unnamed 
"sources," President Fujimori ordered the National Intelligence 
Service [SIN] to conduct a poll to check whether the 
private-sector opinion pollsters' figures on the president's 
reelectability were correct. 
  The findings of the SIN: Fujimori enjoyed a 72-percent 
popularity rate ("6-8 percent more" than in the other polls); in 
a two-way race, Fujimori would get 55 percent over de Cuellar's 
35 percent; in a two-way race against Belmont, Fujimori would 
get 52 percent to Belmont's 38. If the two vice presidential 
candidates were Congressional President Jaime Yoshiyama and 
Congressional Vice President Victor Joy Way (both of Asian 
descent) only 3 percent would vote for the three-person ticket 
while 90 percent would not, reputedly saying "that's a lot of 
Chinamen." Asked if there should be a woman on the ticket, 77 
percent said yes, 10 percent no. The majority wanted to see the 
female candidate in the slot of second vice president. 
  SI reports that Fujimori is now looking at former Prime 
Minister Hurtado Miller and National Police Inspector General 
Ketin Vidal as vice presidential mates, but is also considering 
Congresswomen Martha Chavez and Luz Salgado, both of New 
Majority-Change `90. 
  According to the sources, 25 SIN officers were sent out to 
"all parts of Lima" to interview 1,200 people, ranging in age 
from 22 to 50.

  [Text] Caracas, 3 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuelan Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli said here today that Venezuela has agreed 
to receive Haitian refugees on the condition that they comprise 
only a small number of refugees who would remain in Venezuela 
temporarily, until the crisis in the Antillean nation is 
resolved. 
  The Venezuelan Government's decision was announced after an 
official U.S. delegation headed by Under Secretary of State 
Strobe Talbott asked the government of Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera to accept Haitian refugees. 
  The U.S. official called the Venezuelan offer "generous," 
and 
he recalled that Caracas had received the very first Haitian 
refugee--President Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was received by 
Venezuela after he was overthrown in September 1991. Talbott 
reiterated that his government wants a "peaceful and 
multilateral" solution to the Haitian crisis. 
  Burelli told newsmen that Venezuela "has informed the United 
States that it will not close its doors and that it will receive 
a group (of Haitians), provided they are temporary refugees who 
will remain until the precarious situation in Haiti is resolved." 
  The foreign minister explained that the Venezuelan Embassy 
in 
Washington will list the number of Haitians eligible to travel 
to Venezuela as an "undetermined number," although "this cannot 
be a large number."

  [Text] Belem do Para (Brazil), 6 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Juan 
Aristides Tavares, Dominican foreign relations secretary of 
state, said the Government of the Dominican Republic guarantees 
it will maintain its border with Haiti, which was closed in 
compliance with the total embargo imposed by the United Nations 
on this Caribbean nation. 
  Tavares indicated to EFE that there is a disposition within 
the 24th OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated today in 
the Brazilian city of Belem do Para, to ensure the total 
effectiveness of the embargo imposed on Haiti in May by the UN 
Security Council. 
  Tavares pointed out that the Dominican Republic is the 
nation 
most harmed by the Haitian political crisis because both nations 
share the island of Hispaniola and also because of the pressures 
it has been exposed to in order to implement the embargo. 
  "No country has had as many problems as we have had. So much 
has been demanded of us; it is as if we were the only ones" 
responsible for contributing to the crisis, the foreign 
relations secretary of state indicated. He added that his 
government has supported all resolutions related to issues 
approved by the OAS and the UN Security Council. 
  "Although the embargo has not been completely effective, we 
have not violated it intentionally, and, moreover, at this time, 
our government has ordered the closing of the border," the 
Dominican Republic foreign secretary said. 
  The Haitian political crisis is the main issue dominating 
the 
24th OAS General Assembly sessions which will be extended until 
next Friday and where 70 proposals related to democracy, human 
rights, security, technical cooperation, environment, 
counternarcotics, and the economic situation throughout the 
American continent will be discussed. 
  Full compliance with the total embargo, especially the 
guarantee that the Dominican Republic will not violate the 
350-km-wide border with Haiti, and the rejection of armed 
intervention to depose the military coupists are the two main 
proposals to be discussed during the Belem do Para meeting. 
  Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, deposed by the 
military in September 1991 and still considered the legitimate 
president of Haiti by the international community, participated 
today in the Assembly inauguration. Aristide has met with 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco. 
  Secretary of State Tavares pointed out that the OAS and UN 
technical observers, who recently visited his country, were able 
to ascertain that the total embargo is being implemented "firmly 
along the Dominican-Haitian border."

  [Text] The minister of justice received the government 
order to act against anyone suspected of favoring a foreign 
intervention in Haiti. 
  Reacting Saturday 4 June to the statements attributed to the 
president-in-exile by the NEW YORK TIMES, the provisional 
government of attorney Emile Jonassaint denounced Father 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's statements. 
  The Ministry of Information stated that it has formally 
recorded the statements of the president-in-exile who, I quote: 
After demanding and obtaining a total embargo against Haiti, is 
calling for an armed action against the country, unquote. The 
ministry asks the Justice Department to take the necessary 
measures to start action against anyone who intends to promote 
an invasion of Haiti, unquote. 
  The government also advised that the national territory 
would 
be defended by the Army. In three press releases issued on 
Saturday 4 June, the provisional government denounced the 
threats of invasion which weigh on the country. 
  The Ministry of the Interior protested against the violation 
of Haitian territorial waters by some foreign ships and advised 
that an order was given to the Armed Forces to take all measures 
to defend the national territory. 
  The government, which asked the population to remain calm 
and 
vigilant in the face of the provocations, also indicated that 
any attacks are likely to provoke a counterattack. The Haitian 
Government, however, reiterated its feelings of friendship and 
of cooperation toward other friendly countries.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 6 Jun (AFP) -- Robert Malval, the 
resigning Haitian prime minister (who is recognized by the 
international community), said on Monday that "the (Haitian) 
people would be more willing to welcome the interventionists 
than to fight them." Malval added that in the event 
international sanctions against Haiti fail, "the armed option is 
being considered more all the time." 
  Speaking over the local private Radio Metropole, Malval 
referred to a foreign military invasion, mainly a U.S. invasion, 
and said that "if an army cannot count on the support of the 
people, it will not be able to resist, regardless of how 
powerful it may be." Malval added that Army Chief General Raoul 
Cedras "is reaching the end of his forces." Malval also 
predicted "very difficult days" for Haitians, and he wished the 
Army would prevent this for the country. 
  Meanwhile on Monday, the Haitian Interior Ministry and 
National Defense (not recognized by the international community) 
issued a communique announcing that "any attack (from abroad) 
will provoke a reply, even a suicidal reply." "The army has 
received instructions "to defend Haitian territory," the 
communique pointed out while protesting over "the violation of 
Haitian waters by foreign warships." The communique concludes 
by asking the people to remain "calm and alert in the face of 
provocations." 
  Meanwhile, the Ministry of Information, Culture, and 
Coordination announced it had "taken note" of statements made on 
Friday by Jean-Bertrand Aristide, president in exile, to THE NEW 
YORK TIMES in favor of a foreign military intervention after he 
spoke out in favor of total embargo. The government communique 
requests there be a legal proceedings case against "all citizens 
who try, through their actions or words, to promote the invasion 
of our country." 
  President Aristide clarified his statements, denying he had 
asked for a military intervention in Haiti, which is prohibited 
by the constitution. 
  Finally, a presidential communique signed by Emile 
Jonassaint 
(not recognized by the international community) announced the 
establishment of a national crisis commission led by the economy 
and finance minister "to administer the embargo and to guarantee 
the rights of the people to food and work."

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" from an interview with Prime Minister Robert </F>
Malval by Clarens Renois; from the "Meeting" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Malval] [words indistinct] always absolute 
equality. The alleged provisional government has de facto power, 
but no authority. This power has no legality, no legitimacy. It 
is a power resting upon bayonets, bayonets that are increasingly 
rusted. For our part, we have not pretended to hold the 
government machinery in our hands. We therefore have not been 
relieved of what we did not have, but we have kept moral 
authority in the face of the usurpers and legitimate authority 
in the eyes of the international community. What the people, 
those responsible for the coup d'etat, do not yet understand is 
that for President Clinton, the Haitian problem is no longer a 
Haitian problem, but rather a problem of U.S. domestic policy. 
On that score, President Clinton is going to show the same 
determination he showed with other problems falling within the 
scope of U.S domestic policy. 
  [Renois] [Words indistinct] Haiti in all that? Meanwhile, 
there is the embargo that was adopted by the UN Security 
Council. Mr. Prime Minister, there are also threats of 
international intervention. In September of 1993, you did not 
want a total embargo for Haiti, but today, we have reached that 
point. What is your government's report, today, on the economic 
situation in the country, the problems of the poor, the deprived 
strata of this country? 
  [Malval] In September 1993, I had the same opinion as the -- 
let us say -- international community. It was after the 
Governors Island agreement. We all believed in the good faith of 
General Cedras. The development of events proved that Gen. 
Cedras is not a man of his word. Negotiations with someone who 
does not respect what he signs are senseless. Today, my firmness 
remains the only language possible in view of such demonstration 
of bad faith. 
  (?Cedras had) in his hands all the cards possible to get the 
country and himself out of the crisis. He preferred to try to 
outsmart everyone. He thought his fantasies were realities. 
Well, today, unfortunately, all of us are paying the full price 
for ambitions which -- all things considered -- are 
disproportionate because.... [pauses] here again, I like to use 
psychological profiles. I know what I am going to say is very 
strong, but it is my way of perceiving and relating things: Gen. 
Cedras represents what I would call the debris of the sensual, 
decadent Jean-Claudism without vision. 
  Today, Gen. Cedras has run out of ideas. He has no 
alternative to offer the country but a succession of puppet 
governments that have no foundation among the people, no legal 
foundations, no constitutional foundations, and no international 
recognition. This is very little to offer a country that is 
experiencing the most intense crisis of its history since 1804.

  [Text] The Turks and Caicos Islands have agreed to 
temporarily receive Haitian refugees. After Jamaica, it will be 
the turn of the Turks and Caicos Islands to accept the Haitian 
boat people on their territory for questioning by the U.S. Coast 
Guard. This decision was made by the local government of the 
Turks and Caicos Islands, a British colony located 90 miles off 
Haiti. Rothschild Francois has details: 
  [Begin Francois recording] In the agreement concluded 
between 
Washington and the Turks and Caicos Island Government, it was 
mentioned that the United States will provide facilities for the 
questioning of Haitian refugees while they are being considered 
for political asylum in the United States. These installations 
will include the utilization of a desalinization factory, the 
extension of the wharf to accommodate the landing of U.S. ships, 
and the building of a landing runway. The United States will pay 
all expenses for this operation and will also provide aid to the 
Turks and Caicos Islands. One to two million dollars will be 
spent for this program. The first U.S. technicians are expected 
on the island within the coming days to prepare for the 
launching of this program, which will be using a staff of 250. 
  According to the Press Society, the agreement between the 
Turks and Caicos Islands and the United States indicates that 
before the center for refugees is operational, the United States 
could begin interviewing the Haitian boat people on board a U.S. 
ship in the waters of Turk Island, more precisely, near Grand 
Turk. 
  Since the announcement of this partial change in the U.S. 
policy regarding Haitian refugees, more than 1,500 refugees have 
been repatriated to Port-au-Prince. The new U.S. policy has not 
yet been applied. This policy provides that Haitian refugees 
will no longer be sent back directly to Port-au-Prince, but will 
be questioned aboard U.S. ships. The qualified refugees who 
receive political asylum could be admitted to the U.S. 
territory, while other boat people would be repatriated to 
Port-au-Prince by the U.S. Coast Guard.

  [Text] Manuel Mondino, president of the National Atomic 
Energy Commission (CNEA), has proposed that the organization's 
productive activities be turned into an incorporated state 
enterprise that will be able to quote its shares on the stock 
market. 
  "We have reached a stage in which the CNEA, which was born 
as 
a series of laboratories, has ended up creating a prolific 
industrial activity that must be broken down into component 
parts," Mondino said. 
  "The state tasks that cannot be delegated must remain within 
the state and the productive components must be overseen by a 
state incorporated company. The key is to maintain the 
laboratory-factory unity," the CNEA chief added during the 
commemoration of the organization's 44th anniversary. 
  The proposal to quote shares on the stock market, although 
Mondino did not go into details, still must be approved by the 
government. The CNEA and the Energy Secretariat still do not 
have a common position on how to undertake the privatization of 
nuclear activity, the only one that remains in the hands of the 
state since the energy market's deregulation began two years ago. 
  But the CNEA Association of Professionals has demanded the 
sanctioning of a law that will regulate nuclear activities. 
  The organization recalled that "the most advanced countries 
consider energy a strategic asset."

<F P=106> [Commentary by Marcelo Pontes: "Bornhausen Throws First </F>
Stones"] 
  [Text] Jorge Bornhausen, president of the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party], feels like a wounded animal in the party alliance 
supporting Fernando Henrique Cardoso's candidacy for president 
of the republic. He is ready to fight and attack after shaking 
off the dust from the double defeat of his own candidate--in the 
choice of someone from Alagoas to run for vice president and in 
the campaign polls. 
  A digression before talking about the first blows to be 
struck by Bornhausen: strictly speaking, it cannot be said that 
one defeat is directly related to the other. The latest poll by 
IBOPE [Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute] was 
conducted between 27 April and 2 May. The name of the candidate 
for vice president was announced afterward--on 3 May--although 
it was already known that someone from the PFL would be chosen. 
Specifically, when the fieldwork for the poll ended, not even 
the leaders of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and 
the PFL knew for sure that the vice president would be Guilherme 
Palmeira. 
  It is more probable, then, that what the poll captured was a 
moment of retreat, withdrawal, or strategic error on the part of 
Fernando Henrique rather than the first fallout from the 
skirmishes among party leaders during the negotiations for 
formalizing the alliance between the PSDB and the PFL, an 
alliance that became official on 2 May. 
  If actions at the top had an immediate effect lower down in 
poll results, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva would have been weakened 
by the recent squabbling by the radical groups on the PT 
[Workers Party] Excecutive Committee, which went so far as to 
support slogans apparently more daring than the return of PFL 
members to the administration: the legalization of abortion and 
marriage between homosexuals, for example. 
  Actually, Fernando Henrique dropped in the polls because 
when 
he resigned as minister of finance, he vanished from the media 
and no longer appeared on television during prime time every 
day. Moreover, upon his return to the Senate, he did not assume 
the role of defender of constitutional revision or the 
structural reforms considered essential to the success of the 
economic plan left in the hands of Minister Rubens Ricupero. It 
even seemed that he had washed his hands of his plan. There have 
been no speeches by Fernando Henrique defending his plan. At the 
same time, being hamstrung by party problems, he has also failed 
to adopt the firm posture of a presidential candidate who knows 
what he wants and, even more important, knows how to lead. 
  Getting back to our subject, Bornhausen has gotten tired of 
taking a beating and is ready to hit back. He is striking at 
anyone who tries to disrupt Fernando Henrique's candidacy, 
starting at the bottom: "This Candido Mendes, a 13th alternate 
deputy, went along on one of Lula's campaign trips to beg for a 
job as a minister," he says, referring to the professor who was 
suddenly said to be influential as a political 
coordinator--something denied in party decisionmaking circles. 
And he attacks higher up: if President Itamar Franco interferes 
too much and also disrupts things, he will get what is coming to 
him. 
  Bornhausen's remarks on that subject are more reserved. But 
nonetheless revealing. He is convinced, first of all, that the 
PSDB made an unpardonable mistake by leaving the PFL's preferred 
vice presidential candidate, Luis Eduardo Magalhaes, alone and 
exposed to stone-throwing for a month. 
  That is one way of looking at it. Ceara Governor Ciro Gomes 
(PSDB) sees things differently. He feels that the biggest 
mistake, after deciding to form a coalition, was the failure to 
make former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, who is the real 
boss in the PFL, Fernando Henrique's running mate. 
  Before revealing the second thing he is convinced of, 
Bornhausen stoops down to pick up some rocks: he has no doubt 
that the person responsible for all the confusion leading to a 
month's delay in choosing the vice president was President 
Itamar Franco. The president's most innocent gesture in that 
process is said to have been his attempt to give the vice 
presidential spot to Minas Gerais Governor Helio Garcia. 
  According to Bornhausen, Itamar cannot stomach the influence 
that Antonio Carlos Magalhaes may have on the campaign and on 
the administration if Fernando Henrique Cardoso is elected. 
After all, Magalhaes stayed at Collor's side until the last 
minute and has always been merciless in his criticism of Itamar. 
  Bornhausen is keeping a few rocks set aside for use in the 
near future. He is already unhappy with Fernando Henrique's 
dependence on President Itamar. No matter what he is going to 
do, Fernando Henrique first runs to tell Itamar or discuss it 
with him. Bornhausen views that with suspicion, but he is 
remaining very quiet about it while waiting for this new week to 
pass. 
  He reasons that whatever Itamar had to disrupt in the 
political arena, he has already done it by interfering in the 
choice of a vice presidential candidate. Bornhausen says that 
after tomorrow, when he announces the date for introducing the 
new currency--the real--the president will stop interfering in 
the economic plan. Once the PSDB and the PFL have concluded 
their convention, there will no longer be a Candido Mendes or 
anyone like Jutahy to torment the alliance. From then on, they 
will be out of the way, he says.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 2 
June. 
  The public debt in government titles totaled $53.6 billion 
in 
April, representing a 6.1 percent increase compared with March. 
The domestic debt represented 9.3 percent of GDP in April, 
while it was only 8.7 percent in March. This is due to the 
increase in domestic interest rates and to the inflow of foreign 
financial investments, which forces the Central Bank to issue 
debt titles to prevent an expansion of the monetary base. The 
effective interest rate -- the real interest rate plus the 
inflation rate -- jumped from 46.42 percent in March to 46.49 
percent in April. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese 20 May 94 p 5) 
  The Market Prices General Index, IGP-M, calculated by the 
Getulio Vargas Foundation from 21 April to 20 May, has climbed 
to 42.58 percent in May, 1.67 above the former month's 
percentage. The Consumer Price Index, IPC, calculated by the 
Economic Research Institute Foundation, was 44.66 percent, while 
the real value unit variation in May was 44 percent. The 
Wholesale Price Index, IPA, increased by 41.34 percent. 
Consumer goods prices increased by 38.65 percent. The 
Consumers Price Index, IPC, increased by 44.02 percent. The 
items whose prices most increased were miscellaneous expenses, 
54.01 percent; clothing, 48.94 percent; and transportation, 
45.53 percent. The Civil Construction National Index, INCC, 
dropped to 45.18 percent. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in 
Portuguese 31 May 94 Business and Finance Section p 3)

  [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (PL) -- The group of individuals that 
is still occupying the Belgian ambassador's residence in this 
city is facing isolation, in light of an agreement reached 
between Brussels and Havana regarding the illegality of their 
action. 
  Sources close to the Foreign Ministry have confirmed to 
PRENSA LATINA the two governments are still pressuring the group 
to leave the building they occupied by force on 28 May in an 
attempt to spur the diplomatic representation into helping them 
leave the country. 
  Conversations between the Cuban and Belgian Foreign 
Ministries have led to an agreement rejecting such actions, 
which violate local law and all forms of established 
international procedure. 
  The day the event took place Cuba stated the violation of 
sovereign rights of diplomatic representations accredited in 
Cuban territory will never be accepted as a valid means of 
leaving the country and underscored the vital importance of 
complying with current legislation. 
  Based on a specific request from the Belgian Government, 
security at the perimeter of the occupied installation has been 
strengthened. 
  Willy Verriest, special envoy of the Belgian Government, and 
Paul Vermkirsch, Belgian ambassador to Havana, have already met 
on several occasions with important Cuban Foreign Ministry 
officials to analyze the unfolding situation as well as the 
technical aspects of the measures to be adopted to facilitate a 
final solution. 
  Four men who were inside the residence have already accepted 
the guarantees offered by Cuba and left the residence and have 
been able to go home without being bothered by authorities. 
  The situation is normal inside the Belgian residence, and 
this fact, which local and foreign reporters can observe from 
the outside, contrasts, according to what a Latin American 
diplomat has told PRENSA LATINA, with certain alarming reports 
propagated by anti-Cuban organizations abroad. 
  Cuban Foreign Ministry officials reaffirmed today they have 
not received from the Belgian side any type of proposal 
involving the acquisition of food and other services for the 
unexpected guests.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- Cuba and Belgium maintain 
their agreement that the departure of the individuals who 
illegally occupied the residence of the Belgian ambassador in 
this capital is indispensable, local foreign ministry sources 
told PRENSA LATINA. 
  The situation at the diplomat's home remained unchanged 
during the past few hours in view of the refusal of the 
occupants to return home and to initiate the normal paperwork to 
travel abroad if they so desire. 
  The solution, accepted by the Belgian Government, includes 
the decision by the Cuban Government to allow the evacuation of 
the residence by the people who forced their way into it without 
applying legal measures stipulated for this type of action, both 
in Cuba as well as in any other country, the source explained. 
  The source himself confirmed that the Belgian Government 
informed the Cuban Embassy in Brussels of its desire to 
reinforce, with diplomatic and technical personnel, the small 
mission in Havana. 
  Cuba accepted the request, bearing in the mind the current 
situation in the Belgian Embassy and the small number of 
officials working and there. However, the official request for 
the extra personnel to travel to Havana has not yet been issued 
to the Cuban Foreign Ministry. 
  Political observers said that the prolongation of the 
occupants' stay at the Belgian ambassador's residence has 
weakened their position in view of the lack of support they have 
received. This has occurred basically because the two 
governments involved have been in accordance on how to deal with 
the situation. 
  The departure of four of the occupants, a few days ago, who 
have not been harassed by authorities, may encourage the 
remaining occupants to follow this path as the proper way to 
resolve the problem. 
  At any rate, conversations between Belgian representatives 
and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials continue to take place 
normally, as PRENSA LATINA has learned. More contacts are 
expected in the next few hours.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (PL) -- Nine days after they 
forcefully entered the Belgian ambassador's residence in Havana, 
the group of occupants continue defying the Cuban and Belgian 
governments' opposition to their stay in the building. 
  Foreign Ministry sources confirmed today to PRENSA LATINA 
that normal conversations continue between Belgian diplomats and 
local foreign ministry officials in a daily analysis of the 
situation and of the mechanisms to apply for attaining a 
definite solution to the issue. 
  Willy Verriest, special envoy from Brussels, and Paul 
Vermkirsch, chief of the Belgian mission in Cuba, have already 
met twice with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende. They 
also exchanged viewpoints with Serafin Rodriguez, chief of the 
Europe Department. 
  In all cases, the parties agree on recognizing the illegal 
nature of the stay by the group occupying the Belgian residence, 
which violates the security and extra territoriality of this 
European nation's legation in the Caribbean island. 
  Likewise, the parties ratified the Cuban Government's 
refusal 
to recognize this type of action as a valid method to leave the 
country, as it ignores the legal procedures established for 
these cases. 
  The sources reaffirmed that as a show of good will, Cuba 
will 
abstain from taking measures against those who voluntarily leave 
the ambassador's residence and decide -- if they so wish -- to 
process in an appropriate manner their request to travel abroad. 
  This measure [words indistinct] was confirmed by the recent 
departure of four occupants and their return, without any 
difficulty, to their respective homes. 
  Foreign reporters and observers who reside in Havana feel 
that this attitude by the other occupants of ignoring the joint 
stand of Cuba and Belgium regarding their irregular presence in 
the residence keeps them isolated, and it is deliberately 
hindering a solution to the problem.

  [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (PL) -- The rejection 
of military intervention in Haiti as a solution to the political 
crisis in that country appears to be a majority stand in Latin 
America. Several Latin American foreign ministers unanimously 
expressed their opposition to that possibility when they met 
here yesterday with Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of 
state, to discuss the Haitian situation. The Latin American 
diplomats are visiting this city to attend the inauguration 
today of the 24th OAS General Assembly. Interviewed before the 
meeting with Talbott, the foreign ministers of Venezuela, 
Bolivia, and Costa Rica recommended waiting for the applied 
economic pressures to resolve the problem. "There are still 
diplomatic, economic, and financial measures that can be 
implemented before considering other more extreme actions," 
Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo Villalobos noted. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli, whose 
country, along with Canada, France, and the United States, 
belongs to the so-called group of friends of the UN secretary 
general, said with regard to the Haitian situation: "We oppose 
military intervention." Meanwhile, Bolivian Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar Quiroga also said that he opposed any armed 
actions, which he warned, could lead to cures that are worse 
than the disease. 
  U.S. President Bill Clinton has reiterated that he does not 
reject a military option to "resolve the Haitian situation," a 
policy that has even been opposed by leading U.S. Government 
officials. Analysts assert that, in general, the Latin American 
governments reject this possibility, as opposed to deposed 
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who, last week, asked 
for a "surgical operation" to remove the military from power. 
  Questioned by the local media, Talbott expressed confidence 
that the OAS will reiterate the international position regarding 
the crisis in Haiti, which has been subjected since the end of 
May to a total economic blockade by the United Nations. Talbott 
indicated that many measures have already been jointly 
implemented and that he believes other measures will be 
implemented in the coming days.

<F P=106> [Report by Abel Sardina] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 4 Jun (PL) -- Directors of 
scientific activities from 17 countries meeting here urged 
Ibero-American rulers to reinforce investment to "consolidate 
scientific and technological capacities." 
  Following three days of debate in this Colombian city, 
participants think that scientific-technical consolidation is 
essential "due to the impact it has on improving competitiveness 
and employment in our economies, as well as the well-being of 
our society." 
  The conference on sustained financing for technological 
investigation and development in Ibero-America approved the 
conclusions the previous day. These will be handed to the heads 
of state and government of Spain, Portugal, and the 19 countries 
of Iberic origin, which will meet here 14-15 June. 
  "Sustained growth in public investment in innovation must be 
reinforced in order to consolidate the incipient modernization 
processes of the productive apparatus and to induce businesses 
to participate in the financing of these activities," the 
recommendations state, according to what was learned today by 
PRENSA LATINA. 
  The directors of scientific, technological, and 
investigative 
activities also think that "the decisive participation of the 
three multilateral credit organizations is essential." 
Likewise, they recommended persisting in investigative and 
development efforts, "despite the macroeconomic limitations 
imposed by pressing social priorities." To this end they argued 
that, if this is not done, "the region's project to remain 
competitive in world trade and to use science to improve the 
people's conditions, can be seriously compromised." 
  A press communique on the talks recognized Cuba's effort in 
training masses of professionals and investigators in basic 
sectors as "a notable example of what is sought" in this field. 
  Cuba's Dr. Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science, 
technology, and environment, speaking with PRENSA LATINA, thinks 
that Latin American countries do not have the 
technical-scientific base required to enter the free competition 
imposed by free trade and the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade] agreements. 
  The meeting also had representatives from Argentina, 
Bolivia, 
Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras, 
Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, Portugal, and 
Venezuela.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The newspaper GRANMA today 
published a commentary on the upcoming Ibero-American Summit, 
describing it as a challenge and a commitment for participants. 
The summit is scheduled to begin on Tuesday in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia. 
  GRANMA, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of 
the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that the time has come 
to efficiently and independently revive, reaffirm, and establish 
in concrete the course Ibero-America must follow. 
  The newspaper underscored the fact that the conference will 
be held as a result of the U.S. Government's call for another 
presidential summit, which will be held in Miami in December, 
for the purpose of attacking, discrediting, and overshadowing 
the results of the Ibero-American movement that is under way. 
  This situation creates for the presidents the undeniable 
need 
to reach a clear and definitive commitment in Cartagena that 
will strengthen the community of Ibero-American nations and 
establish a specific integration program, GRANMA said. Further 
on, the commentary stated that this commitment is the only way 
the countries attending the Miami summit can arrive as a group 
that shares strong bonds and common goals. 
  GRANMA said that in Cartagena the presidents will not be 
able 
to avoid the issue of the U.S. economic and trade blockade 
against Cuba, including the Torricelli Law, regarding which a 
statement was issued at the past summit and two resolutions have 
been issued by the UN General Assembly. 
  The commentary emphasizes that Cuba participates in these 
forums with the moral and political authority it draws from its 
huge efforts and social projects, which have achieved goals 
which, for many, still constitute dreams or hopes and its proven 
desire for integration. 
  Ibero-America knows, the newspaper underscored, that our 
country is an unyielding champion of principles, such as 
nonintervention, sovereignty, and self-determination, which are 
not only deeply rooted but legally established and universally 
accepted in international relations. The Ibero-American 
countries, the commentary concludes, will once again have an 
opportunity to examine urgent regional problems and the effects 
and consequences that other worldwide problems have on this part 
of the world, because, for them, this fourth summit is their 
summit.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Miguel Lozano: "Death Trafficking in </F>
Guantanamo, Another Tragic Incident of the Cuban-U.S. Conflict] 
  [Text] Havana [no date as received] -- Ernesto Porte and 
Gleidis Pena thought that the road to paradise existed and 
agreed to pay two guides to lead them through marshes to the 
U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo -- but they found only death. 
  Although that territory is known to be surrounded by mines 
on 
one side and by a fence on the other, they were not torn to 
pieces by an explosion. Their bodies had numerous knife wounds, 
revealing that their last minutes on earth were pure hell. 
  Initial investigations indicate that their murderers were 
Eglis Rojas and Diorbis Rodriguez, who promised to lead the 
couple in May to the military enclave through a safe route in 
order to emigrate with all the advantages that the U.S. 
Government grants to "illegal" Cubans. 
  The Cuban population now awaits the trial and suspects that 
this is not the only incident of its type within the context of 
the abnormal relations between Cuba and the United States that 
promote human tragedies ranging from family separations to even 
death due to maritime journeys aboard inappropriate vessels. 
  Official U.S. sources reported that in 1993 some 3,000 
people 
left Cuba illegally to reach the U.S., risking their lives in 
the treacherous gulf currents, because they knew they would be 
well received and would obtain legal residence, as opposed to 
citizens from other countries. 
  Paradoxically, the U.S. Interests Section in Havana has 
become a tight filter through which it is difficult to pass 
Cubans wanting to travel to the U.S. (for temporary or permanent 
stay). Local sources said that in 1993 only 1,600 island 
residents were granted U.S. visas, although an agreement allows, 
since 1987, the legal entrance of up to 20,000 Cubans each year. 
  A simple look at the surroundings of the Interests Section 
here shows that there is no shortage of candidates to fill that 
quota. Visa seekers wait for days in a nearby park, known as 
"the park of laments," where the most common phrase heard is 
"they rejected me." 
  In practice, U.S. immigration policy has led to a 
progressive 
increase in the number of illegal emigres, especially since 1989 
when the island started to feel the effects of the U.S. blockade 
with even greater force because Cuba lost the traditional 
support of the now defunct European Socialist bloc. 
  The Cuban economic crisis, the privileges granted to Cubans 
in the U.S., and the limited revenues through legal means 
produced an explosive but attractive mixture [coctel] for 
thousands of people who risked their lives (and may have lost 
them) in the past years, traveling on improvised vessels, the 
so-called "rafters." 
  In the case of the double murder in Guantanamo, there is an 
additional factor: the existence of 117.5 square km controlled 
by U.S. soldiers by virtue of an agreement, which will be 91 
years old on 3 July 1994, that is repudiated by local 
authorities. 
  This naval base was rented as a result of the occupation by 
U.S. forces in the past century. It is today one of the main 
trouble spots between Cuba and the United States. 
  Cuban sources reported more than 12,500 provocations since 
1962 ranging from shootings (some of them mortal for Cubans), 
the movement of armored vehicles a few centimeters from the 
borderline, and naval and airspace violations 
  Out of the total territory occupied by the United States, a 
scant 94.4 sq km are on firm land, 38.8 on water, and 29.4 on 
swamps. They are, however, well guarded and protected by the 
Armed Forces of two countries, which have virtually been at war 
for the past three decades. This makes it almost suicidal to 
try to enter this territory. 
  The United States, which maintains the enclave on the basis 
of a treaty signed in 1903, does not comply with the provisions 
of this same document; for example, the provision that 
establishes that Cubans who illegally cross the demarcation 
boundary must be returned. 
  Media sources in Miami have estimated that approximately 
4,000 Cubans have risked their lives since the victory of the 
revolution by crossing the boundaries to savor all the benefits 
offered by U.S. authorities to all "illegal" Cubans. 
  The [U.S.] Congress approved the Cuban Adjustment Law in 
1966, which allows all Cubans "under oath" to enter, obtain work 
permits and other benefits, including the obtainment of their 
permanent residence, one year and a day after they arrive. 
  They do not have to be sponsored by any relative, nor do 
they 
have to request political asylum, for which most would not 
qualify because their reasons are eminently economic or based on 
their desire to rejoin their relatives. 
  Ernesto Porte's and Gleidis Pena's unfortunate demise is not 
unique. Until now, no Cuban or U.S. source has attempted to 
give an exact report on how many Cubans have died in the journey. 
  In the Guantanamo crime's case, the murderers were 
discovered 
because the 20,000 pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official 
exchange rate) were given to the alleged guides by one of the 
murdered man's brothers after his [brother's] driver's license 
was presented as evidence that the operation had been successful. 
  But a question still remains unanswered: How many of those 
who have disappeared have really been victims of unscrupulous 
traffickers? 
  Probably the answer will never be known. However, it is 
quite clear that illegal departures are a lucrative business and 
that criminals from both countries are involved in it. 
  The Ricky Robert Hoddynott case is proof of this. Hoddynott 
is a U.S. citizen who resides in Key West, Florida. He was 
injured and arrested at the Cojimar fishing town near Havana, 
last year, when a border patrol foiled his attempt to illegally 
take people out of the country on his yacht called "Midnight 
Express." 
  Hoddynott confessed that he was in the business of smuggling 
people and that he charged between $5,000 and $10,000 per 
person. Cuban authorities have asserted that he is not the only 
one to make profits from the difficult Cuban-U.S. relations by 
offering a trip to paradise that many times ends up in hell.

<F P=106> [By Silvio J. Mendiandua: "Visit by Carlos Salinas Will </F>
Strengthen Cuban-Mexican Relations"] 
  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (PL) -- Mexican Ambassador to Havana 
Carlos Tello said here today Mexican President Carlos Salinas' 
visit to Cuba will strengthen relations between the two 
countries, and as a result, new forms of cooperation may emerge 
and current programs of cooperation may be strengthened. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the Mexican diplomat 
said: Salinas is expected to arrive on 13 June and will stay on 
the island for 24 hours, and his presence here will be further 
evidence of the strength and solidity of our relations. 
  Tello, who began his mission in this capital this year, 
affirmed: The talks between Salinas and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro will produce new ideas and initiatives for promoting 
bilateral exchanges. 
  The ambassador said the two leaders will discuss in general 
political, economic, cultural, and commercial relations during 
their dialogue as well as programs of scientific and 
technological cooperation, all of which have been developing in 
a firm and cooperative manner. 
  He said: No specific agreement is expected to result from 
this encounter, because negotiations between the two countries 
on issues of economic or commercial interest are so fluid and 
dynamic that agreements may be signed at any moment, not 
necessarily during a visit. 
  He recalled that in recent years Mexico's presidents had 
visited the island during their respective administrations: 
Luis Echeverria (1975); Jose Lopez Portillo (1980); Miguel de 
la Madrid (1988); and now Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
  To reciprocate, he said, Cuban President Fidel Castro had 
visited Mexico on three occasions during the past five years. 
These exchanges at the highest level are a direct and 
straightforward way of manifesting the solidity of relations, he 
said 
  Tello also mentioned the recent visit to Mexico of U.S. 
Democratic Representative Robert Torricelli, who has meddled in 
the domestic affairs of Cuba and Mexico and who was told during 
his visit to Mexico of the independent nature of the foreign 
policy of the country of the Aztecs and Mayas. 
  Torricelli is the author of the bill, which the U.S. 
Congress 
later approved, that establishes a tightening of the economic 
blockade against the largest of the Antillean islands. 
  The Mexican ambassador said his country's foreign policy is 
a 
state, not a government, policy and one of its main permanent 
principles is recognizing the people's right to 
self-determination. 
  In another part of the interview, Tello revealed the Mexican 
Government team that will organize Salinas' visit with Cuban 
officials will arrive in Havana today. 
  Ambassador Ricardo Ampudia, director general of the Mexican 
Foreign Secretariat Protocol Office, will head the Foreign 
Policy Cabinet, which the Mexicans call these advisers, which 
will include a group of individuals from various backgrounds 
that will decide between today and 8 June the agenda of the 
visit. 
  Salinas' visit on 13 June, the day before the beginning of 
the meeting of the Ibero-American presidents, is a way of 
manifesting solidarity with Cuba, Tello said. 
  Tello also revealed that during the summit, the chiefs of 
state of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela will sign a free trade 
agreement. Mexico has signed similar documents with Chile, Costa 
Rica, Canada, and the United States, and it is negotiating 
others with the Central American countries.

  [Text] Mexico City, 4 Jun (PL) -- The Mexican press today 
highlights several recent developments here in support of Cuba, 
particularly the announcement of a visit to Havana by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari and a resolution issued by the Latin 
American Economic System [SELA] condemning the U.S. blockade 
against the island. 
  EL DIA affirms in an editorial column that the Mexican 
president's visit to Cuba confirms Mexico's right to expand its 
international relations and exercise its sovereignty to 
establish or strengthen its relations with every country of the 
world. The article adds that Mexico's position illustrates that 
we are not willing to bend under the United States' intervention 
policy. It also states that the U.S. trade embargo against the 
island and the so-called Torricelli Bill can only be the 
brainchild of "a government that lives in a barbaric era, 
ignoring law and morality." 
  In addressing U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli's visit to 
this country, EL DIA affirms that the legislator was sent home 
with nothing to tell. "He went home empty-handed and full of 
resentment." The same paper, in a front-page story, highlights 
the SELA resolution approved here yesterday protesting the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba. 
  It also publishes a letter from the group known as Let's Go 
for Cuba praising the gesture made by Mexican legislators of all 
parties to donate one day's pay to purchase crude oil for the 
island. The letter announced that the group will cast off with 
the "third solidarity shipment" to Cuba at the end of this month. 
  The newspaper LA JORNADA carries a front-page headline that 
says "SELA Calls for Lifting of Blockade Against Cuba" and an 
editorial column on the resolution the organization issued 
against the U.S. trade embargo on the island. According to the 
daily, SELA spoke out clearly against Washington's measure. 
Furthermore, says the editorial, the organization's decision to 
protest the blockade "constitutes recognition of its blatant 
inappropriateness and its undeniable interventionist nature." 
It stresses that the step taken by SELA morally discredits the 
blockade's validity, while it rallies 27 American nations around 
an issue that has been the reason for conflict since 1962. 
  Mexico's daily EXCELSIOR also devoted a portion of its front 
page to the organization's decision, with a headline reading 
"SELA Demands That the United States Lift the Trade Embargo 
Against Cuba." 
  EL SOL DE MEXICO publishes the same headline: "SELA Demands 
That United States Lift the Trade Embargo Against Cuba." A 
headline in the economic section of EL NACIONAL states: "27 
Nations of Latin America Speak Out Against the Blockade Against 
Cuba."

  [Text] Mexico City, 5 Jun (PL) -- Jorge Pinto Mazal, under 
secretary for foreign relations for Latin America and the 
Caribbean, said in Mexico City that relations between Mexico and 
Cuba are consistent, solid, and steady. 
  In statements to the press, the official said that the 
Mexican Government has always maintained a very close 
relationship with Cuba, not only because of their close border, 
but because of the obvious ties of friendship and affection 
between both peoples. Regarding the upcoming visit to Havana by 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Pinto Mazal said that the 
idea is to maintain a "very open and fluid" bilateral relation. 
  According to Foreign Affairs Secretariat sources, during 
Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, planned for 13 June, there 
will be contacts at the highest level with Cuban officials, 
which reaffirms Mexico's policies and principles toward Cuba. 
Likewise, the official emphasized that Mexico demands an end to 
the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba, as reflected in 
Friday's resolution adopted by the Latin American Economic 
System (SELA). Pinto Mazal ruled out highs and lows in Mexico's 
ties with Cuba and added that Salinas' presence in Cuba will 
endorse the traditional ties between both peoples.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Carlos Fazio] </F>
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Reports indicate or you 
can conclude from these reports that in his accidental and 
unproductive visit to Chiapas, U.S. Legislator Robert Torricelli 
showed his true self -- a modern-age conquistador. 
  Arrogant and an interventionist, the Democratic Party 
representative from New Jersey, chairman of the Western 
Hemisphere Affairs subcommittee in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, menacingly waves the banners of democracy and 
human rights. His true objective is to make gains to further 
his career in the U.S. Congress by profiting -- via lobbies that 
amount to millions -- from other people's misfortunes. 
  The distinguished visitor has a unique history. He has 
obtained notoriety in the past years from the so-called 
Torricelli Law that bears his name and which was signed by then 
President George Bush on 23 October 1992. 
  The amendment prohibits U.S. based firms to conduct business 
with Cuba through their business subsidiaries in third 
countries. It also considers penalties for countries that have 
economic ties with Havana with the illegal extraterritorial 
implementation of U.S. laws. 
  According to the WALL STREET JOURNAL, Torricelli's old 
activities were unknown until the funds of Jorge Mas Canosa's 
National Cuban-American Foundation started to augment 
Torricelli's bank account. In those days, a publication of the 
Cuban Studies Center reported: "Everybody in Miami knows that 
Mas Canosa is the moral author of the Torricelli bill." 
  There is no doubt that Torricelli is clever. His amendment, 
also known as the "Democracy in Cuba Act," was approved with 
bipartisan consensus and Bill Clinton, then the Democratic Party 
presidential candidate, gave it his endorsement. 
  Among his other initiatives, this modern redeemer, who now 
attempts to supervise the elections in Mexico and to tell the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) what it must do, 
promotes destabilization actions of "individuals and 
organizations" against Cuba. He favors an armed strife of the 
negative kind -- the kind used by the death squads financed by 
the Pentagon and the CIA and groups organized by the United 
States, such as the anti-Sandinists in Nicaragua. 
  Two years ago, Wayne Smith, former chief of the U.S. 
Interest 
Section in Havana and a man who cannot be accused of being 
pro-Cuban, wrote in the LOS ANGELES TIMES that the Torricelli 
Law was "one of the most despicable and injurious legislative 
proposals" forged in 1992. 
  In the Cuban case, Torricelli took advantage of the 
circumstances of an electoral year in the United States. Many 
legislators wanted to be reelected and were afraid they would be 
accused of being "soft" on communism. In reality, the law shows 
Washington's double standards: Bush proclaims his Initiative of 
the Americas and free trade (later ratified by President 
Clinton) with great fanfare but, due to ideological reasons, 
Cuba is cut off by Adam Smith's "invisible hand." 
  Robert Torricelli does not play alone. On 20 February 1990, 
Connie Mack, the Republican Party senator from Florida, 
announced in Washington the formation of a caucus in both houses 
of Congress to reinforce hostilities against the island. The 
so-called "Caucus for Cuba's Freedom" was formed by eight 
legislators with known anti-Cuban positions, six of the 
legislators were from Florida, as well as the Heritage 
Foundation, the National Cuban-American Foundation of Jorge Mas 
Canosa, and other conservative organizations. Obviously, 
Torricelli was a part of this monster. 
  When President Bush signed the Torricelli Law in a campaign 
act in Miami on 23 October 1992, he sanctioned the United 
States' contempt for the international community, including its 
main NATO allies and its two NAFTA [North American Free Trade 
Agreement] partners: Canada and Mexico. 
  The bipartisan consensus showed that it was a strategic bill 
with covert military objectives and could constitute the 
preamble to a direct aggression against the island, including an 
armed intervention "for humanitarian purposes." 
  The international community repudiated the initiative. It 
meant the United States could illegally exercise its economic 
power to mar other nations with political objectives, which is 
explicitly condemned by the United Nations. The initiative also 
was an attempt to implement U.S. laws and extraterritorially, on 
third countries.

<F P=106> [PRENSA LATINA headline: "Congressman Torricelli Continues </F>
Meddling Tour"] 
  [Text] Managua, 3 Jun (PL) -- U.S. Congressman Robert 
Torricelli today reiterated to the Nicaraguan Government a 
threat about retaining aid promised by Washington if the 
decision to return confiscated property to U.S. citizens is 
delayed. 
  Torricelli arrived in Managua yesterday in the company of 
Republican Party Representative Cass Ballenger "to review 
compliance with U.S. laws on the return of confiscated property 
to North Americans anywhere in the world." 
  After inspiring repudiation during his recent stay in 
Mexico, 
where he was criticized because of his alleged desire to meddle 
in local politics, Torricelli now wants to "pressure the Violeta 
[Chamorro] Barrios government," according to a Nicaraguan media 
expression. 
  According to this Democratic congressman, who promotes the 
amendment that has hardened the economic blockade the United 
States has maintained against Cuba for more than three decades, 
the report to be prepared on his meetings will be evaluated by 
the U.S. Congress in Washington to decide whether or not 
financial assistance to Nicaragua should be frozen in 1995. 
  The Chamorro government is in favor of either returning 
confiscated property or indemnifying those people who were U.S. 
citizens at the moment of the confiscation and in dealing with 
the cases of people who acquired U.S. citizenship after the 
confiscations, the way cases involving Nicaraguan citizens are 
treated. 
  Washington's ambassador to Managua, John Maisto, has 
reported 
that the Helms-Gonzalez Amendment does not envisage exclusions 
among U.S. citizens based on nationalization dates. This point 
would considerably expand the number of people seeking 
compensation, because, while the Nicaraguan Government 
acknowledges that there are more than 20 unresolved confiscation 
cases involving U.S. citizens, the new confiscation lists 
involve hundreds.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jun (PL) -- The delegations attending 
the 20th council of the Latin American Economic System (SELA) 
adopted today a resolution that condemns the U.S. blockade 
against Cuba, which has been in effect for more than 30 years. 
  According to reports given by SELA sources to PRENSA LATINA, 
the decision is based on opinions already reflected in U.N. 
resolutions against the U.S. policy toward Havana. 
  In this regard, the SELA document urges the elimination of 
the restrictions against the island as its effects are 
detrimental to the Cuban population and it demands that 
unilateral actions, which are contradictory to the international 
economic and political situation, be suspended. 
  A few minutes before starting the ministerial phase of the 
20th council, SELA Permanent Secretary Salvador Arriola told 
PRENSA LATINA that the organization maintained its position to 
reject the blockade against Cuba, which it expressed two years 
ago when Washington approved the so-called Act For Democracy, 
also known as the Torricelli Law. 
  The text of the Latin American and Caribbean organization's 
resolution asserts the need to reaffirm, among other principles, 
the sovereign equality of states, non-interference in internal 
affairs, and freedom of trade and navigation, included in 
numerous international legal instruments. 
  Likewise, SELA's resolution highlights the appropriateness 
of 
strengthening commercial relations among the countries in the 
American hemisphere in adherence to the principle of freedom of 
trade and navigation. 
  Statistics reported by Havana indicate that the island has 
lost approximately $40 billion with the U.S. restrictions and 
its attempts to block commercial relations between the Cuban 
Government and foreign businessmen and institutions.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jun (PL) -- The 20th Council of the 
Latin American Economic System (SELA) today approved a 
resolution rejecting the U.S.-imposed economic, trade, and 
financial blockade instituted against Cuba more than three 
decades ago. The document, which was studied by 
ministerial-level delegations, recognizes the importance of 
reaffirming the sovereignty of the region's countries and says 
in its text: 
  "The need to put an end to the U.S.-imposed economic, trade, 
and financial blockade against Cuba. [sentence as received] 
  "In view of paragraphs A and B of articles 3 and 4 and 
paragraphs 1 and 4 of article 5 of the Panama Agreement and 
considering resolution No. 112 regarding the `imposition of 
coercive economic measures' and resolutions 47/19 and 40/16 of 
the UN General Assembly, entitled `The Need To End The 
U.S.-Imposed Economic, Trade, and Financial Blockade Against 
Cuba'; 
  "Whereas, there is the need to reaffirm, among other 
principles, the sovereign equality of states, nonintervention in 
their internal affairs, and the freedom of international trade 
and navigation recognized in numerous international legal 
instruments; 
  "Whereas, free trade is an element that contributes to the 
people's economic development and well-being; and 
  "Whereas, there is the need to boost trade relations in the 
American hemisphere, in adherence to the principle of free trade 
and navigation. 
  "The Latin American Council resolves to reject the 
application of unilateral measures that affect free development 
of international commerce and contravene principles of 
international law. To this end, the Council urges the lifting 
of the economic, trade, and financial blockade against Cuba and 
expresses support for UN General Assembly resolution 48/16, 
which demands the elimination of unilateral actions that are 
incongruent with the international economic and political 
context."

  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry 
confirmed today the recent release from prison for humanitarian 
reasons of Mexican citizen Marcelo Garcia Ruvalcaba, who had 
been sentenced by a local court for the crime of terrorism. 
  The foreign minister told PRENSA LATINA that Garcia 
Ruvalcaba 
has a serious kidney problem, and in view of the situation, the 
Cuban Government made the extrajudicial decision to release him 
for humanitarian reasons. 
  The Mexican citizen was sentenced to 10 years in prison by 
the People's Provincial court in this capital on 28 February 
when it was proven that he had brought into the country hand 
grenades and counterrevolutionary pamphlets aimed at carrying 
out terrorist activities. 
  Garcia Ruvalcaba established ties in the Caribbean country 
with individuals hostile to the revolution. He admitted his 
guilt in the public trial attended by representatives of the 
Mexican Embassy and relatives of the defendant. 
  The Mexican citizen is an employee of Continental Airlines 
of 
the United States. He has a residence in Los Angeles where he 
traveled after his release. 
  The Cuban Government's decision on 26 May was previously 
passed to the Mexican Foreign Ministry through the proper 
diplomatic channels.

  [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (PL) -- Cuba is respected, it is 
listened to, and its proposals are taken into consideration 
because of the prestige, the authority, and the role it has 
played throughout the years in the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], 
Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said in a telephone 
interview with PRENSA LATINA. 
  Robaina said this can be verified by how the Cuban 
delegation's suggestions were taken into consideration in the 
drafting of the final document, which will be submitted 
tomorrow, the last working day of the meeting of the foreign 
ministers of the NAM, which is being held in Cairo, the Egyptian 
capital. 
  The minister described the meeting as positive "not only 
because of its results but also because of the high number of 
foreign ministers present and their almost unanimous commitment 
to strengthen the movement." He also noted the consensus in 
guaranteeing the continuity of the NAM and in drafting a 
document that can reinforce the progress attained in Jakarta, 
Indonesia, in 1993, as well as making progress in the 
reinforcement of the role that should be played by this group of 
109 countries in these complex political times. 
  "These have been the priorities we have all had during these 
intense working days, and we are still working at this moment in 
the economic and political commissions, in which Cuba is playing 
an important role," he said. The foreign minister noted that 
the amendments presented by his delegation were incorporated 
into the final document, in which there is also recognition of 
the role played by Indonesia while leading the movement. 
  Commenting on the possible designation of Colombia as the 
next host of the NAM in 1995, he insisted that in the face of an 
increasingly unipolar world the most important thing is the 
collective commitment of those of us who represent two thirds of 
humanity in having a voice and sufficient well-earned authority. 
  "I believe that that is what has motivated us in this forum. 
There is an understanding of these things, and we have made 
progress in drafting the documents in the meeting and in holding 
a unilateral meeting with all the delegations present here," he 
said. He noted, however, that this opportunity is also part of 
the strategy that the NAM had been pursuing in a systematic 
manner, having the Presidency rotated throughout the regions of 
the world. 
  "It is a big commitment, and we do not have the slightest 
doubt that Colombia can play an important role in the 
development of the NAM. I believe it is a big commitment for 
Latin America at a difficult time for the movement, and it will 
be especially up to Colombia to guarantee the movement's 
reorganization, strengthening, and increasingly important 
presence at the international forums," Robaina said. 
  Asked about the acceptance of the Cuban proposal to 
democratize the United Nations, Robaina said it was widely 
supported by the majority of the participants. "We have the 
authority to say that if democracy is demanded of the peoples 
and countries, it must also be demanded of the United Nations. 
We can no longer be fooled with the false concept of a 
democratization process; we have to achieve a transparency in 
that international forum," he pointed out. 
  He also said that the Cuban delegation wanted not only to 
denounce this situation but also to present proposals. Speaking 
about the upcoming Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, he said these meetings continue to be "an opportunity 
to hold discussions without receiving orders from the United 
States. 
  "It is particularly threatened by the hemispheric summit 
convened by the U.S. Government in Miami with the clear purpose 
of discrediting it (the Ibero-American summit), and, in view of 
this intention, it is necessary for Cartagena to come out 
stronger," he said. 
  As for the meeting in Colombia, he pointed out that with 
independence in carrying out their actions, the Latin American 
peoples are increasingly more independent and will continue to 
find their own roads. "I have trust in the way the Colombians 
will prepare the summit and in the peoples' response. I believe 
that in Cartagena we are going to have an important forum and an 
opportunity for debate without prewritten speeches. "I prefer a 
summit of actions and not of intentions," said the Cuban foreign 
minister, who met in Cairo with most of his counterparts 
attending the ministerial conference of the NAM.

  [Text] Doha, 5 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Foreign Relations 
Minister Roberto Robaina visited the Umm Sa'id industrial zone 
located on the outskirts of the capital city of Qatar, as part 
of his two-day visit to this Persian Gulf state. The tour began 
with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that 
utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million 
tons of steel in 1993. 
  A management delegation representing this steel company 
visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing 
cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban 
foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's 
willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field 
in which the island has a considerable infrastructure. 
  Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the 
Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is 
considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the 
Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be 
received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief 
of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign 
relations, health, and finance. 
  In addition, tomorrow Robaina will officially inaugurate the 
new Cuban Embassy in Doha, which will be in charge of relations 
with Oman and other Gulf emirates with which Cuba recently 
established diplomatic relations. Relations between Havana and 
Doha received significant encouragement during the last few 
months as a result of the visit of Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad 
Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani to Cuba.

  [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina met today with Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, 
Qatar's crown prince and defense minister, to whom he delivered 
a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  Cuban delegation sources said that Robaina and Al Thani 
talked about the current state of bilateral relations and shared 
the two governments' interest in finding ways to expand and 
develop them in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Robaina 
expressed his country's willingness to promote cooperation with 
Qatar in areas already identified, such as health, medical 
products, tourism, and sports. 
  Meanwhile, Prince Al Thani reiterated his government's 
willingness to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based 
on respect for the sovereignty and free choice of social 
development systems, regardless of pressures from third 
countries. He added that he was aware of the situation in Cuba 
and made a pledge to promote the visit of a delegation of 
businessmen to Havana in the coming weeks. Al Thani accepted 
Robaina's invitation to visit Cuba and learn firsthand about the 
Cuban situation. 
  In addition, Robaina held a working meeting with Public 
Health Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Suhaym Al Thani and the health 
delegation that visited Cuba recently. Bin-Suhaym conveyed his 
willingness to hire health personnel and buy pharmaceutical 
products to be registered and sold in Qatar. The Qatari 
official conveyed his admiration for the Cuban public health 
system, particularly, the results obtained with the concept of 
the family doctor (basic attention for the population). 
  During this second visit to this Arab-Persian Gulf emirate, 
Robaina also met with the minister of finance, economy, and 
trade, to whom he explained the characteristics of foreign 
capital investment in Cuba. The Qatari minister confirmed that 
in July, he will submit various proposals to his government 
regarding areas in which it is feasible to begin immediate 
commercial exchanges. 
  Today, Robaina officially inaugurated the headquarters of 
the 
Cuban Embassy in Qatar. Relations with Oman, a Persian Gulf 
country with which Cuba established diplomatic relations in May, 
will also be handled from the embassy in Qatar.

  [Text] Doha, 6 Jun (PL) -- At the end of a 40-hour official 
visit to this capital city today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina said in a news conference: "I am not speaking of ideas 
only, but specific economic plans as well." 
  Robaina said that Qatar is a very special country because, 
despite the pressure applied on Cuba and countries that have 
relations with Cuba, Qatar decided to establish diplomatic 
relations with the island, relations that led to the 
establishment of a Cuban Embassy there. "It takes courage to do 
something like this, and Qatar is brave," Robaina said. 
  He reported that during his stay here negotiations were held 
on cooperation in the fields of health, sports, and biomedicine, 
and new methods were discussed to expand bilateral cooperation. 
  Official talks were held in the evening between the Cuban 
delegation and Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim 
Bin-Jabir Al Thani, during which the friendly ties between the 
two countries and willingness to strengthen these ties were 
affirmed. 
  In addition, on Monday Robaina inaugurated the Cuban Embassy 
in Doha, where diplomatic relations with neighboring Oman will 
also be handled.

<F P=106> [By Orestes Perez Perez] </F>
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- After intense and 
constant diplomatic lobbying, Colombia gave Latin America the 
good news that it had been selected to chair the next Nonaligned 
Movement's (NAM) heads of state and government conference to be 
held in 1995. 
  The Colombians will be in charge of preparing this 
outstanding event. Before being selected, however, they had to 
sidestep several obstacles preventing Latin America from 
obtaining the Presidency of that organization. Egyptian 
President Husni Mubarak wanted the position after ending his 
term as the head of the OAU, said accredited diplomatic sources 
in Cairo. 
  After the sixth NAM summit held in Havana, Cuba, in 1979, 
Latin America had to wait 15 years to be able to preside over 
this movement again, which was founded in Bandung, Indonesia, in 
1956 and which currently comprises more than 100 states. 
  Latin America declined to assume the NAM directorship in 
1991, when Nicaragua was selected and its government explained 
that it was going through a very serious internal crisis that 
did not allow it to organize the event. The principle of 
rotating the Presidency of NAM, will, on this occasion, allow 
the governments in this part of the world to give special 
attention to the economic and social inequalities in the region, 
among other points, diplomatic sources have commented. 
  During the first summit (Belgrade, Yugoslavia in 1961), Cuba 
was the only full Latin American member in the movement. 
Brazil, Bolivia, and Ecuador participated as observers, and the 
continent was only mentioned once during the meeting to condemn 
the U.S. occupation of the Guantanamo Naval Base in the eastern 
part of Cuba. 
  At the second NAM summit held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1964 nine 
observers from this part of the world attended the event, in 
addition to Havana, and topics related to Latin America were 
given greater attention. However, it was not until the 1973 
conference in Algiers that the Latin Americans had significant 
representation. At that meeting, Argentina, Guyana, Peru, 
Jamaica, Trinidad-Tobago, and Chile entered NAM. Six years 
later, Havana brought in 11 effective members and 10 observers 
from Latin America, and in New Delhi, India, in 1983 the 
region's representation increased to at least 25 countries, of 
which 13 were full members. 
  The NAM summit held in Cuba not only marked Latin America's 
complete identification with the fundamental principles of 
nonalignment but also the failure of 20 years of U.S. efforts to 
isolate Cuba from the rest of the continent. 
  Latin America's growing participation in the movement 
increased its geographic and ideological dimension. Its 
contribution was essential for NAM to take a stand on the 
sovereign rights of states, drug trafficking, and terrorism, 
among other issues. 
  Asked about Colombia's appointment to chair the heads of 
state and government meeting in 1995, Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina said to PRENSA LATINA that "it is a tough 
commitment for Latin America at a difficult moment in the 
movement."

  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- Cuba today announced that, 
despite current economic difficulties, its infant population is 
totally protected by massive vaccination against illnesses 
common in other countries. A Public Health Ministry report 
states that top priority is given to vaccinating children 
against tuberculosis, hepatitis-B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus, 
whooping cough, meningococcus groups B and C, mumps, German 
measles, measles, and typhus. 
  These maladies cause a great number of deaths in 
underdeveloped countries, including Latin American countries, 
but in Cuba, with its prevention policies, a 95 percent rate of 
eradication among the country's children has been guaranteed. 
  The system begins working immediately after the child is 
born, through tuberculosis and hepatitis B vaccinations; and 
when they are four weeks old children receive the polio vaccine, 
which is then reactivated in subsequent booster shots. 
  Cuba produces the only effective meningococcus groups B and 
C 
vaccine in the world, as well as the tetanus toxin and vaccines 
intended to prevent typhoid and hepatitis B. 
  The newspaper GRANMA reported today that a vaccine against 
leptospisarosis, as well as other vaccines designed to prevent 
various illnesses, is currently being clinically tested as part 
of the program that fully protects children and adults.

<F P=106> [Report by Miguel Lozano] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 3 Jun (PL) -- Despite its current economic 
difficulties, Cuba has managed to keep operational its free 
education system, which includes a program for foreign students 
which this year will graduate almost 30,000 graduates from 110 
countries. 
  An Education Ministry report shows that in the summer of 
1994, 3,460 youths from America, Asia, Africa, and the Near East 
will complete courses in medical technology, primarily in the 
fields of teaching, medicine, and stomatology. Since 1965, when 
the first students in the program arrived, 26,027 foreigners 
have graduated from the country's institutes and universities. 
  Lazara Aguirre, a Cuban Foreign Ministry employee in charge 
of the program, explained that changes throughout the world and 
economic problems on the island forced changes in certain 
aspects of the program in order to maintain their profoundly 
humanitarian projection. However, although economic support has 
been reduced, the authorities have continued to provide support 
and adopt measures to guarantee commitments, which means that 
the foreign student plan will be maintained at least until the 
year 2005, when the final group that is currently in Cuba will 
complete their studies. 
  Aguirre also pointed out that graduates can practice 
teaching 
at centers akin to the careers they studied. Most of the 
foreign scholarship holders in Cuba come from Sub-Saharan 
African states (2,754), the American continent (400), North 
Africa, the Near East (94), and Asia (36). Angola is the 
country with the most students in Cuba (910), followed by 
Mozambique (422) and Nicaragua (249). With regard to graduates 
from 1965 through 1993, Angola also holds first place with 
4,764. It is followed by Nicaragua (3,428), Ethiopia (3,070), 
Mozambique (2,184), and Congo (1,236). 
  The fall of socialism in Europe intensified the U.S. 
blockade 
which, according to conservative estimates, has cost Cuba over 
$40 billion over the past three decades, but, in spite of this, 
free education has been maintained. Although with unavoidable 
restrictions and a shortage of teaching equipment, all of Cuba's 
schools and educational institutions have remained open, which 
shows that the country's authorities consider education a 
priority.

<F P=106> [By Raimundo Lopez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- During today's International 
Children's Day celebrations, Cuban children affirmed that they 
are confident about their future and asked the U.S. Government 
to lift the three-decade-long blockade imposed against their 
country. 
  I foresee a future in which all my friends have jobs, and I 
am a commercial pilot, said Reinaldo Rodriguez, one of dozens of 
children questioned this morning by Radio Rebelde about how they 
would like to celebrate this day dedicated to them. 
  I would also like our neighbor to the north, the United 
States, to lift the blockade that has caused my family, friends, 
and country so many difficulties, added Rodriguez, a sixth grade 
student who attends school in Havana. 
  Many other youngsters said they enjoy a happy childhood, 
despite the adverse economic situation the island has 
experienced during the last four years following the loss of its 
main trading partners in the now-vanished socialist camp, which 
was led by the former Soviet Union. Official reports gathered 
by PRENSA LATINA indicate that Cuban children, despite the 
critical economic situation, maintain education and health 
standards equal to those of the world's most developed nations. 
  Cuban officials said that even in 1993, described as the 
most 
difficult year of the so-called special period, infant mortality 
was 9.4 per 1,000 births, ranking Cuba among the 20 nations with 
the lowest infant mortality rate. The officials added that the 
preschool mortality rate was reduced to 5.9 per 10,000 in 1993, 
one of the lowest rates internationally. 
  They stressed that up to five years of age, Cuba has one of 
the highest survival rates in the world -- 98.8 percent, while 
in the 5 to 14 year range the mortality rate has remained very 
low for five years -- 0.4 per 1,000 residents. 
  The Health Ministry pointed out that deaths caused by 
diarrheic infections and acute respiratory ailments have been 
noticeably reduced to an average of between 0.3 and 0.7 percent 
in infants up to one year old and between 0.3 and 0.8 percent in 
children up to five years old. 
  The Health Ministry reported the main causes of infant 
mortality in Cuba are similar to those in developed countries: 
perinatal afflictions and congenital defects, adding that young 
Cubans are immunized against 11 diseases, often using vaccines 
developed exclusively on the island. The Health Ministry 
specified the hepatitis B and the meningitis meningococcus type 
B vaccines, and this year protection was intensified against 
measles -- a disease whose transmission has been curbed in Cuba 
since mid-1993. 
  Meanwhile, the Cuban Education Ministry today said that the 
likelihood of all Cuban children continuing their education is 
guaranteed. 
  The national budget assigns education and health together 
2.440 billion pesos -- at the official exchange rate on par with 
the U.S. dollar -- out of a total budget of 12.502 billion pesos 
allocated for the current year. 
  Cuban children also sent greetings via fax to all of the 
world's children from the UNICEF's office in Havana. May 
friendship and love among children fill every corner of the 
world like the rays of the sun, because we are the hope of the 
world, says the text, which is accompanied by a drawing of 
children holding hands surrounded by flowers.

<F P=106> [Speech by OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares </F>
at the opening ceremony of the 24th OAS General Assembly at the 
Peace Theater, Belem, Para State -- live] 
  [Excerpts] Your Excellency Mr. Brazilian President, Your 
Excellency Mr. Haitian President, Your Excellency Mr. Brazilian 
Foreign Minister, Your Excellencies Messrs. Foreign Ministers 
and heads of delegations, Your Excellencies Messrs. Ministers, 
Your Excellency Para State Governor, my friends: 
  Your Excellency's presence at this opening ceremony honors 
us 
and fills us with pride. We realize that your gesture, for which 
we thank you very much, represents Brazil's confidence in the 
OAS' actions and destiny. It also represents the brotherly 
welcome of the Brazilian Government and people to the 
illustrious representatives of the American continent countries 
gathered here. [passage omitted] 
  I also want to thank Mr. Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Ambassador Celso Amorim, who is my friend, for his permanent and 
longlasting interest for, support of, and collaboration with the 
OAS' work, which has culminated with the preparations for this 
OAS General Assembly. [passage omitted] 
  Now, it is time for democracy. The last 10 years in the 
Americas have marked a time of political progress, restoration 
of peace, economic readjustments, and the beginning of an 
economic recovery. These processes, however, have been 
accompanied by an ever-increasing social dissatisfaction and 
unrest resulting from persistent inequalities and increasing 
poverty. Tough obstacles have been overcome but dramatic 
challenges must still be faced. 
  The peoples of this hemisphere have performed a prodigious 
institutional reform. This reform must now have the economic and 
social conditions to become stable and improved. To preserve and 
increase the participation of the people in the democratic 
process, we now must rescue and make a reality the humanistic 
concept of overall development adopted by the OAS. It is not 
enough to grow. Countries must grow to correct unfairness and 
neutralize frustrations and hopelessness that limit and threaten 
the exercise of democracy. [passage omitted] 
  It is true that ideological confrontation has given way to 
unexpected opportunities of understanding and cooperation 
between antagonistic groups. Disputes and conflicts of a 
nonideological nature, however, have appeared or reappeared. 
They are historic, cultural, racial, and tribal. The 
international system has yet to discover its new configuration 
because it is conditioned by the interaction of 
state-disintegrating forces and associative forces that create 
economic spaces that shelter political integration tendencies. 
Meanwhile, our region -- the most peaceful in the world despite 
some episodes of violence -- has given examples of its capacity 
to respond and act dynamically. The American states have updated 
the inter-American system. From 1985 to 1994, from Cartagena de 
Indias to Mexico City, the OAS has been transformed. I know of 
no other international organization to adapt and transform 
itself so profoundly and in such a short period of time. I know 
of no other organization to readjust so consistently its own 
nature, purposes, and basic principles. Ten years ago in 
Brasilia, we defended the idea of reinvigorating confidence in 
the OAS. We considered it an indispensable condition for 
fulfilling its specific function of serving as a natural forum 
for the hemisphere's countries. This confidence has been 
restored and ensured by the member countries through a judicious 
and cooperative dialogue. 
  It is now the time for participation. I have the pleasure 
to point out the immediate and positive reaction of the member 
countries' governments to President Clinton's opportune 
invitation for a Summit of the Americas in December. For many 
years, there had not been such propitious conditions to promote 
a broad and creative exchange among the chiefs of state and 
government. I can see the OAS' effective presence in this 
occasion. Its organization and mechanisms can support the 
summit's preparation and cooperate in putting its results into 
practice. 
  Now is the time for dialogue. Interest in the OAS' 
performance, which was awakened at the national congresses held 
in the member countries, makes us think about ways of 
associating them more closely with our activities. The member 
countries' representativeness is, undoubtedly, ensured by their 
governments. It is appropriate, however, to think of situations 
in which delegates from the congresses of this hemisphere's 
countries can regularly gather to support this regional 
organization. This would be a step forward in the path already 
opened by the OAS secretariat general and the several congresses 
associated in regional and subregional groups. I believe this 
issue should be considered. 
  The OAS continues to be, above all, an expression of 
confidence in the importance of laws. It acts within the 
framework of the first principle contained in its charter, which 
I will now cite: International laws are a norm of behavior the 
states must adopt in their reciprocal relations. Respect for the 
laws is an essential ingredient of democracy. The implementation 
of this principal is the basis for domestic and international 
peace. Nothing contributes more to hemispheric security than 
respect for precepts resulting from a decision-making process of 
participatory qualities, particularly if it can harmonize 
different interests and balance asymmetrical forces. It is now 
the time for full respect for international laws. 
  The new conditions reigning in the hemisphere led the member 
countries to adopt bold and unprecedented decisions to defend 
and promote democracy. The instruments created for this 
objective have proven adequate, but the economic resources to 
ensure their implementation still are limited and cannot be 
accurately foreseen. I believe it is necessary to establish a 
special fund, independent of the regular OAS budget, to finance 
the activities related to the consolidation of democracy in the 
hemisphere. This fund will allow an equitable distribution of 
the expenses resulting from these actions. [passage omitted] 
  It is now the time for solidarity. Belize, Canada, and 
Guyana 
have joined the OAS as full members in recent years. All 
sovereign countries in the hemisphere enjoy the same situation. 
Not all governments, however, participate in the common tasks. 
As everyone knows, I have been asking for some time whether it 
is the right time for the member countries to reexamine the 
decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the Cuban 
Government from OAS activities. The 1990's are different from 
the 1960's. 
  Mr. President, my farewell to this General Assembly is not 
an 
agreement for separation but a pact for presence. There is a 
time to arrive and a time to leave, but one's entire life is the 
time to work. I will not abandon my ties, solidarity, and 
commitment toward liberty, democracy, justice, laws, and peace 
that mark the dreams of all of us. 
  Messrs. Foreign Ministers and heads of delegations, please 
allow me to address these final words to my fellow countrymen 
and the people of my state. I convey to them my most tender 
greetings and my most profound thanks. I have lived in many 
distant countries during my professional life. The memories and 
love of my people have always been a strengthening factor in 
adversity and a joy in the happy moments. Thank you very much.

  [Text] Santiago, 4 Jun (EFE) -- Chile will request that the 
Bolivian sea coast claim not be included in the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, which opens in Belem de Para (Brazil) on 6 June. This 
request is listed in point 15 of the issues to be discussed 
during the foreign ministers' meeting, entitled "Report on the 
Bolivian Maritime Problem." 
  According to some sources, the Chilean position on the 
Bolivian claim of a maritime outlet through the Chilean coast is 
an issue that should be discussed by the two countries and is 
not a multilateral issue for discussion in an international 
meeting. 
  According to the local press, the Chilean Government 
believes 
there are no pending conflicts with Bolivia, with which Chile 
has maintained consular relations since 1978. 
  The Chilean delegation to the OAS will be headed by Chilean 
Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, who left for Brazil on 4 June. 
Figueroa will then leave for an official visit to Argentina on 8 
June. 
  The Chilean press said the Bolivian claim for a sea outlet 
to 
the Pacific is one of the recurrent issues submitted to the OAS 
Assembly. Bolivia lost its sovereign sea coast after the 1879 
Pacific War, which it fought with Peru against Chile.

  [Text] Latin American narcotics chiefs agreed to create an 
organization to fight the scourge of drug trafficking, which is 
increasingly more interconnected with another illegal business: 
gunrunning from Europe to Latin America. The decision was 
adopted at a meeting in the Dominican Republic. Here is a 
report by Chelo Garcia: 
  [Begin recording] [Garcia] There is concern that the ties 
between Latin American drug traffickers and gunrunners are 
getting increasingly closer. They work in teams and support 
each other. Sophisticated long- and short-range weapons of 
every caliber, mostly from Europe, are flooding Latin American 
black markets. The Latin American narcotics chiefs decided to 
make efforts to break this deadly alliance during the drug 
summit held in the Dominican Republic. 
  [Colombian counternarcotics chief Colonel Leonardo Gallego] 
The most important things were the plans for new methods and 
means to strengthen this struggle against drug trafficking. 
  [Garcia] It was also proposed at the drug summit that the 
Latin American countries form a single bloc of support to 
control drug cultivation, production, processing, and 
trafficking. They will also work shoulder to shoulder to 
prevent the use of aircraft, vessels, and ground transportation 
to supply materials that Latin American drug traffickers need to 
produce drugs. [end recording]

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (AFP) -- The Cuban Police have 
tightened security around several diplomatic missions and 
residences in Havana, while 124 Cubans continue to occupy the 
residence of the Belgian ambassador hoping to obtain political 
asylum. 
  Security has been beefed up, particularly around the 
Argentine Embassy, some 100 meters from the Belgian residence, 
in Miramar District (western Havana). A special brigade truck 
and two patrol vehicles are blocking the street by the mission. 
Also, dozens of security guards, some armed with AK-47 rifles, 
were seen guarding the area for the first time since the 
beginning of the crisis. The intense deployment apparently is 
due to rumors of the imminent departure of would-be emigres to 
Argentine diplomatic missions. 
  The situation appeared to be at a standstill in the Belgian 
residence, which has been occupied for 10 days by 68 men, 32 
women, and 24 children. Belgian and Cuban representatives have 
been in daily contact, while Belgian special envoy Willy 
Verriest is intent on trying to convince the refugees to leave 
the building.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos titled: "Our Homage"] </F>
  [Text] Good evening. Today, our words are dedicated to 
several sectors of the national life, whose commemorations we 
have observed. First, I do not want to forget that today, 6 
June, is the 33d anniversary of the creation of the Interior 
Ministry [Minint], one of the most active fronts at this current 
juncture of the fatherland, the most active sector against crime 
and those who wish to threaten national security. I extend my 
respect and admiration to these honorable men and women. 
  Comrades, our people are perfectly aware of the 
conscientiousness and morality with which you conduct your work 
in the midst of enemy lies and the barrage of hostile 
propaganda. Our people are aware of how treacherous is the lie 
abroad that distorts the impeccable attitude of even the last 
man of the Minint in the midst of very difficult conditions and 
against totally amoral people. 
  We constantly witness the committed endeavors of the Minint 
workers to confront crime, which has strategically sided with 
the enemy. Yet, this is to no avail with those people who take 
women and children as hostages in their petty personal desires 
to emigrate. Leaving Cuba does not condemn them; what does is 
that they do not hesitate to use violence, trickery, theft, 
lies, and unlawfulness to do so. Our people clearly understand 
this struggle and this is why they admire and support you 
because the people recognize your bravery and the need to 
maintain order and confront those who attempt to make chaos and 
crime the rule. 
  Other sectors are also observing important dates. The day 
after tomorrow is Legal Workers's Day -- lawyers and judges, 
clerks and prosecutors, registry workers, notaries, and lawyers' 
office workers. To them, we also extend our respect and hopes of 
seeing their efficiency increase in the fight against crime and 
illegality. 
  There are other important dates. There is also the Library 
or 
Librarians' Day; friends who are many times not recognized given 
the urgency of the other problems we face. We find libraries and 
librarians at every level of our school system, and in the 
cities, with their supply of information and culture ready for 
our work or leisure -- a book, magazine, pamphlet, map, data, 
math tables, a name, a dictionary, the title of a book, or a 
foreign tale, anything. A thousand things that we need to know 
and for which we have to consult libraries and librarians. We 
know that nowadays these institutions face many difficulties, 
given the shortage of resources, and perhaps some might have 
closed their doors. These are transitory problems, however. 
Libraries continue to survive despite it all, and their wealth 
of knowledge is at our disposal. There is nothing more fair or 
well deserved than extending to them our respectful salute.

<F P=106> [Report by Irma Caceres] </F>
  [Text] The U.S. Government has given top priority to the 
50th anniversary of D-Day, which marked the opening of the 
second European front against the Germans in World War II, or so 
President William Clinton has demonstrated. 
  It would seem that the White House is seeking to restore the 
Americans' role in military operations abroad or otherwise 
strengthen the continuity of this policy, which is such a 
sensitive issue for the current Democratic administration, given 
the cases of Bosnia, Somalia, and perhaps Haiti. 
  U.S. troops landed on the French coast of Normandy on 6 June 
1944 when the forces of the former USSR had already defeated the 
German Empire. Military experts' opinions on this event differ 
broadly. Many consider the opening of the second front an action 
belated by at least two years, when the strategic initiative was 
in the hands of the Soviets, who had paid a high price in 
material losses and lives. 
  Others agree that the actual prospect of a German defeat at 
Soviet hands and a future change in the correlation of forces 
was undoubtedly the factor that determined the opening of the 
second front. This allowed the United States, at the end of the 
war and without having contributed much, to actively participate 
in the division of the spoils and the theft of minds.

<F P=106> [Report by Froylan Arancibia, from Qatar, for "National </F>
Radio News"] 
  [Text] Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina met 
with Defense Minister Prince Muhammad bin Khalifa Al Thani, to 
whom he delivered a message from Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  According to Cuban delegation sources, Robaina and His 
Highness Al Thani spoke for more than 30 minutes in a positive 
atmosphere, consistent with the signs of hospitality and respect 
shown the delegation throughout its stay here. 
  The two officials exchanged views on the current status of 
bilateral relations and agreed that both governments have an 
interest in finding ways to increase and develop these 
relations. The Cuban official expressed his country's interest 
in developing cooperation in areas that have already been 
identified, including health, medical products, and tourism, as 
well as in other areas where equal opportunities and 
possibilities for investment exist. 
  Moreover, Prince Al Thani reasserted his country's 
determination to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based 
on respect for each country's sovereignty and the freedom to 
choose its own means of social development. Likewise, he said he 
is aware of the situation on the island, and pledged to sponsor 
the visit of a business delegation to Havana within the next few 
weeks. 
  The Cuban foreign minister also met today with Health 
Minister Sheik Hamad bin Sukhaym, who stated his willingness to 
hire Cuban health personnel and purchase biopharmaceutical 
industry products for their registration and use in Qatar. 
  A meeting was held with the minister of finance, economy, 
and 
trade at noon. Bilateral talks at the Foreign Ministry are 
scheduled to begin this afternoon, shortly before the departure 
to Havana.

<F P=106> [Report by Demetrio Villa Urrutia from Cartagena for the </F>
"Doing Radio" newscast] 
  [Excerpts] The 10-person Cuban delegation that will handle 
the Ibero- American summit on 14-15 June arrived in Cartagena 48 
hours ago. [passage omitted] 
  The first official activity before the Ibero-American summit 
concluded this weekend; it was the scientific conference on 
sustainable development. Our chief representative was Dr. Rosa 
Elena Simeon Negrin, minister of science, technology, and 
environment. 
  The conference mainly sought to review the formation of 
human 
resources, financing, and the ways to prepare Latin America for 
the area's integration. Precisely the issues of integration, 
economy, and trade will be the main issues to be discussed in 
this fourth version of the Ibero-American summit. [passage 
omited] 
  Shortly before her departure, Comrade Rosa Elena Simeon made 
some statements to the Cuban media delegation, which is here to 
assess the event and its topics. Here is a small fragment of 
Comrade Rosa Elena Simeon's statement: 
  [Begin Simeon recording] Emphasis has been placed on 
something throughout the debate and the three roundtables: 
Research work must be guaranteed sustained financing. What do 
we call sustained financing per se? We mean it must have 
continuity. That is the experience in our country, which today 
invests $25 per inhabitant. The revolution has made an 
extraordinary effort in the formation of human resources 
throughout the history of the revolution and today we can enjoy 
the results. You cannot invest in the research sector and then 
fail to give it continuity. That investment is not recovered in 
the short term. This entails medium term and long term 
investments. [end recording]

  [Text] On Sunday, an explosion occurred in the area of the 
No. 2 plant at one of the PPG [anti-cholesterol agent] 
production complexes. A commission created for this purpose is 
currently investigating the causes of this incident. 
  The commandos of La Coronela and the No. 8 Unit of the 
Minint 
[Interior Ministry] National Fire Prevention and Extinguishing 
Directorate were the first to arrive following the emergency 
which occurred at 1100 on Sunday at the No. 2 plant of Western 
Scientific Center. 
  The determined participation of the young firemen prevented 
the fire from spreading. Emilio Gomez Hernandez, a delegate of 
the 95th Sector of the Fifth Arroyo Arenas Council, also played 
an important and courageous role. Eva Alvarez arrived 
immediately and was able to interview him. 
  [Begin recording] [Alvarez] What did you do when you heard 
the explosion? 
  [Gomez] I was in the yard. I quickly evacuated the 
personnel over to the river, as we have been instructed to do. 
  [Alvarez] In which yard were you? 
  [Gomez] In my back yard. I was going into the house, coming 
from the backyard. 
  [Alvarez] Do you live across the street? 
  [Gomez] I live exactly across the street from the plant. 
When I heard the explosion I looked up and saw red flames. I 
thought it was an air raid or a bomb. Then I quickly... 
[pauses] I expected another explosion so I quickly evacuated 
the personnel across the river. I mean all the personnel in the 
area. 
  [Alvarez] And the neighbors. 
  [Gomez] And the neighbors. There are 18 houses in the area. 
I evacuated them toward the river. Then I quickly ran over to 
the plant [words indistinct]. 
  [Alvarez] What did you do at the plant? 
  [Gomez] I tried to close the valves, meaning the boiler's 
valves. 
  [Alvarez] Do you know about that? 
  [Gomez] Yes, I know where they are because I have been here 
with them. There are three valves at the plant. 
  [Alvarez] The plant where the accident occurred? 
  [Gomez] Yes, the plant where the accident occurred. Then I 
checked this side and had someone close down the street which 
leads to the freeway and the street which leads to Lazaro Pena. 
  [Alvarez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival? 
  [Gomez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival and to keep 
public transit vehicles away. Then I checked the neighborhood 
in case someone had been injured. That is what we did. 
  [Alvarez] Did you have anything to do with the injured 
comrades? 
  [Gomez] No. 
  [Alvarez] Did they sustain minor injuries? 
  [Gomez] Yes. 
  [Alvarez] I understand nine of them sustained injuries but 
were able to walk. 
  [Gomez] I saw when they left and they were able to walk. 
That is what I saw. 
  [Alvarez] Then you made sure the valves were secure. 
  [Gomez] I secured the vales and the neighborhood, afraid 
another explosion would occur. In other words, everyone in the 
neighborhood was led to the river. [end recording] 
  Emilio Gomez Hernandez surpassed his responsibility as a 
delegate. He evacuated the neighbors and, thanks to his 
knowledge about the plant, he was able to close the valves 
connected to the boilers -- despite a shower of glass which 
threatened his own life. This man, a retired officer from the 
explosives team, honored the motto of the Minint, which today 
marks its 33rd anniversary -- our strength is the people's 
strength.

  [Text] Havana, 31 May (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban Agriculture 
Minister Alfredo Jordan today criticized the country's private 
farmers for failing to sell produce to the state, and he 
announced the government will take steps to resolve the problem. 
  At a meeting in western Matanzas Province, Minister Jordan, 
who is a member of the Politburo of the ruling Communist Party 
of Cuba, said the state will impose a tax on "fallow lands" to 
force private rural landowners to produce. He said, "We must 
make demands on those who fail to comply and, if necessary, 
apply the penalties prescribed by the Agrarian Law without fail." 
  In the first admission by a public official of the farmers' 
reluctance to sell crops to the state, Jordan said, "There are 
landowners who have not delivered even one quintal of 
agricultural products over the course of the year; this is 
totally unacceptable." 
  The official demanded that private farmers who control 20 
percent of the country's arable land comply with their 
obligation to sell crops to the so-called collection centers 
that are in charge of marketing for the state. "Feeding the 
people is a sacred task, and those who possess land and make 
production commitments through agreements with the state must 
fulfill their obligations," Jordan insisted. 
  The minister's warning coincided with the publication in the 
official press of reports regarding a drop in the production of 
tubers and vegetables in 1993. Many private farmers prefer to 
sell their crops to middlemen or consumers who visit the rural 
areas on weekends to buy provisions at prices higher than the 
official price. 
  "There are farmers who do not sell their crops to the 
state's 
collection centers and who seek to enrich themselves by other 
means," said the weekly newspaper TRABAJADORES, the mouthpiece 
of the unions. The weekly said that in 1993, the production of 
various crops, including vegetables and tubers, dropped 77 
percent in comparison to the 1992 crop, and this was made 
evident by empty stores in Havana. 
  According to the source, the volume of agricultural 
production by the cooperative-peasant and state sectors 
declined, and the ensuing deficit has led to a reduction in 
other related crops. 
  Private farmers produce 35 percent of the country's total 
agricultural production, producing more than the state in crops 
such as coffee, tobacco, tomatoes, onions, garlic, green 
peppers, and carrots. 
  In terms of land distribution, from September onward state 
agriculture has been reorganized into basic units of cooperative 
production which are managed by experienced farmworkers. These 
units control some 80 percent of the island's arable land. 
  Following the two agrarian reform programs implemented in 
the 
sixties, there are some 200,000 registered private farmers 
affiliated with the National Association of Small Farmers. As a 
group, these private farmers own more than 865,000 hectares of 
land, which are distributed among 2,260 farming cooperatives. 
  Some 125,000 farmers refused to pool their land together but 
maintain a certain level of cooperation through "credit and 
services cooperatives." 
  Private rural farmers had sold their products at the 
so-called "farmer's free markets" which flourished up until 
1986, when the government ordered them closed to avoid 
"excessive enrichment."

  [Text] We would like to report the sugar harvest resumed in 
Camaguey Province when the Noel Fernandez Central's machinery 
was started in Minas Municipality. The central's mills were 
started after the recent torrential and extended rains. The 
central will also receive raw material from areas around the 
Brazil and Sierra de Cubitas Centrals, and zones where the rain 
has not delayed the harvest so much. 
  Within the strategy, work is also underway in complexes 
located in the central and southern part of the province. Some 
of them will thus participate in the mill work by receiving 
sugarcane from their own areas and from neighboring areas. 
Within the principle of cutting sugarcane wherever possible and 
sending it to whichever central can mill it, Camaguey sugarcane 
workers have resumed the harvest operations because they are 
aware of the importance of contributing as much as they can for 
the country's economy.

  [Text] Jaime Crombet, vice president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], has described 
Santiago de Cuba's overall energy situation as positive. The 
thorough repairs conducted at the Rente Electric Plant, which 
has already reached an output of 315 megawatts or 45 percent of 
its capacity and has resulted in a significant reduction in 
power outages, deserve to be described as such. 
  Crombet was told that electricity generation in the province 
will reach 75 percent capacity and be more reliable after 
December. Crombet warned of the adverse effect of increasing 
fraud among consumers who, as a result of the increase in 
electric fees, return to new ways to receive electricity 
illegally. Crombet called for a widespread campaign, beginning 
today and continuing until September, against citizens receiving 
electricity through illegal hookups and lines, mills, and other 
methods. Crombet added that is necessary for everyone using 
electricity to pay for it. 
  Crombet also called for adopting measures to solve the 
problem of burned out transformers plaguing Santiago de Cuba, 
due to voltage shifts caused by some self-employed workers using 
electrical equipment in their small workshops. Crombet praised 
the provincial boilers efficiency program, which has attained 
efficiency in 115 of the 274 boilers available; developments in 
biogas production; and developments in hydroelectric power with 
34 such small plants in operation, along with the Carlos Manuel 
de Cespedes Dam, which will generate 2.8 megawatt-hours -- 
enough to supply almost the entire city of Contramaestre.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a roundup of reports on 
noteworthy events and commentary marking the 33d anniversary of 
the Interior Ministry (Minint), monitored from Havana Radio in 
Spanish on 6 June. 
  Orlando Contreras delivers an "Our Opinion" commentary on 
the 
anniversary, hailing the Minint for playing a leading role in 
the fight against crime. Contreras congratulates Minint 
employees for achieving success with the people's support. 
(Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94) 
  The announcer of the "Doing Radio" newscast says the station 
wishes "to congratulate, very early on this beautiful Monday 
morning, our Minint fighters, who today celebrate their 33d 
anniversary." Later in the cast, the announcer says: "We love 
our Minint comrades, who today celebrate their 33d anniversary. 
They certainly have a right to celebrate!" (Radio Rebelde 
Network in Spanish 0900 GMT 6 June 94) 
  The announcer of the "First Thing" newscast sends "special 
greetings, very special greetings, to the Minint forces, who are 
celebrating their 33d anniversary today. Therefore, our 
greetings to all those, who in one way or another, work in or 
have something to do with the foundation and creation of the 
corps." (Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 6 June 94) 
  The "Doing Radio" newscast features the participation of two 
members of the Jose Marti Pioneers, who "salute and 
congratulate" all the Minint members, "particularly those who 
work in the traffic-accident prevention and security 
departments" and "prevent traffic accidents, which cause so many 
deaths, injuries, and damage in the country." They reassert 
that, upon celebrating their anniversary at this crucial moment, 
Minint members "will aptly fulfill their duty as they have done 
on other occasions, when carrying out their missions. They have 
served our people for 33 years and we reassert our greetings. We 
urge them to continue to fulfill their duty." (Radio Rebelde 
Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94) 
  Journalist Fernando Sanchez reports from Ciego de Avila 
Province that "events on this anniversary have been extensive 
and varied in this territory," including a mass wedding in which 
the 14 people who got married are Minint members, "meaning they 
have double ties -- duty and love." The report indicates the 
newlyweds took a wreath to the Jose Marti monument in Ciego de 
Avila's capital. Also, local "Minint Commander Colonel Miguel 
Leiva Rangel presided over the festivities and awarded 
promotions and distinguished service medals." (Radio Rebelde 
Network in Spanish 1155 GMT 6 June 94) 
  Journalist Teresa Valenzuela interviews people on the 
street, 
who comment on the Minint anniversary. One says he has always 
"supported the special Minint brigade because it deals with the 
enemy and criminals on the street." Another says he admires 
"their determination and courage when facing any criminal. They 
act with decisiveness and are confident about the work they 
carry out." A third one says we has "a high opinion of the 
Minint comrades, taking into consideration that their work is 
always full of danger and difficulties. It is truly a corps that 
serves the people." The last person emphasizes that "the Minint 
anniversary is not something you celebrate only with the Minint 
members; it is an anniversary to celebrate with all the people."

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F>
"Doing Radio" newscast] 
  [Text] The 33d anniversary of the founding of the Interior 
Ministry [Minint] is being celebrated today. The "Doing Radio" 
newscast sends all its self-sacrificing fighters its most 
fraternal greetings. 
  The revolution has waged a constant struggle against those 
who have tried to crush the achievements of this process 
throughout three decades; and, within that struggle, the Minint 
fighters have played a role that deserves full recognition. 
Tasks which deal with the prevention of crime and repression of 
activities which conspire against the security, integrity, and 
assets of the people and the citizens represent difficult, 
self-sacrificing work that entails sacrifices, total dedication, 
and -- many times -- serious risks because many Minint fighters 
have lost their lives in the line of duty. 
  These tasks require honest men because nothing is more 
damaging than the abuse of power or the use of that authority 
with intentions other than those granted by the revolution and 
the law to the organizations and the men who serve it. Minint 
fighters have achieved success in their tasks because they have 
had the people's full support. In a revolution like ours, the 
repression of criminal activities, whatever their nature, always 
has the people's support. This is one of the keys of the Minint 
fighters' success in their various activities. 
  Today, when we mark the foundation of the Minint, which was 
formed with a nucleus of men from the rebel army and clandestine 
groups, "Doing Radio" joins the people in greeting those 
fighters with strong principles, convictions, and determination 
to serve the people, which is the source of their authority.

<F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] Today's morning newspaper TRABAJADORES published an 
editorial on page two under the title, "The Elimination of 
Subsidies to Workers Cafeterias." We offer a synopsis of the 
text: 
  The revolutionary government's agreement, which states that 
workers' cafeterias will cover costs with their own income, will 
become effective 1 July. The deadline may be extended until 31 
August, based on exceptions for justifiable cases, to guarantee 
better implementation of the measure. 
  The newspaper TRABAJADORES also stated in today's edition 
that it is therefore necessary to consider this measure closely 
linked with the efforts exerted [as heard] so that no cafeteria 
closes, which would be a severe blow to the workers and 
revolutionaries, wherever it occurs. Quite the contrary, the 
goal is to make the measure, in an effort to improve the 
product's quality, into a challenge -- even motivation -- during 
these difficult conditions in which a salary proves insufficient 
to fulfill this need. 
  The newspaper then says the main idea on which to 
concentrate 
is that the government's measure strives to make cafeterias 
feasible -- that is, self-sufficient. Those that produce a 
profit will be able to use it to improve their own product. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial added: Another essential view is 
that once we know how much a cafeteria costs, we must struggle 
so its feasibility is the result of an improved product rather 
than a mechanical increase in prices. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial concluded: To fulfill this 
measure, which affects us so directly, in an exemplary way, will 
prove the steadfastness with which the Cuban labor movement 
endorses the policy we have outlined, including the 
participation of all workers, and which our government now 
implements to overcome the crisis and come out well ahead, 
stronger, and victorious.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored from Havana 
radio sources in Spanish between 30 May and 2 June: 
  Radio Reloj at 1949 GMT on 30 May reports that nearly 850 
caballerias of sugarcane have been planted in Las Tunas Province 
as part of the spring planting plan, despite the recent intense 
rainfall. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 31 May reports that two 
researchers at Comandante Ernesto Che Guevara nickel factory 
have developed a new method to reduce the filtering and drying 
procedure while increasing the quality of the nickel sulfur 
produced. 
  Radio Reloj at 0204 GMT on 31 May reports that nearly 10,900 
caballerias have been weeded in Las Tunas Province as part of 
the 1994 sugarcane harvest efforts. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 1 June reports that 1,023 
low-cost houses have been built in Granma Province in 1994. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that the (Chillinma) shipyard in 
Havana City has recently finished construction of three lobster 
boats to the Batabano Fishing Complex. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1155 GMT on 1 June reports that the (Input) 
factory, in Santa Clara City, has built its 100,000th bicycle. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that in Las Tunas, the cost per 
patient for the 22 residents in a Jobabo municipal home for the 
elderly is 2.53 pesos daily, covering food and care only. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 2 June reports that in 
Cienfuegos Municipality the municipal committee of the Communist 
Party of Cuba has called for a day of sugarcane planting and 
weeding at the Pepito Tey Complex. Jesus Rodriguez Diaz, 
provincial PCC first secretary, reported that only 75 
caballerias had been weeded during May. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 2 June reports that 
approximately 2,000 caballerias of tobacco will be planted, 
tended, and harvested with the aid of foreign capital. Spanish, 
Dutch, and Swedish companies will invest over $25 million to 
finance the necessary resources for the tobacco crop. The 
largest number of the tobacco caballerias -- 1,600 -- are 
located in Pinar del Rio Province, 65 in Havana Province; 119 in 
Villa Clara; and 195 in Sancti Spiritus. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that the planting of "power 
forests" -- quick-growth trees to produce coal -- is not 
progressing well, or in those places where the planting goals 
are met, the forests are planted far from the sites where the 
energy is required. Rebelde adds that the entire planting 
program is going to undergo a thorough review. 
  Radio Reloj at 1930 GMT on 2 June reports the Liberacion de 
Fomento Cane Cutters Brigade in Sancti Spiritus is the first 
brigade to reach the goal of 4 million arrobas in the current 
harvest; adding that the brigade used 161 days to complete the 
volume with a daily productivity of approximately 25,000 
arrobas. The report also says the brigade completed its work at 
the Ramon Ponciano Mill and has been transferred to Yaguajay, 
where it will work at the Obdulio Morales Mill. 
  Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 2 June reports the first oil 
pipeline built in Moa, located on Cuba's northern coast, began 
to operate today with the arrival of a Cypriot supertanker which 
brought 50,000 tons of crude oil. The report says the system is 
built with pipes which have a 24-inch diameter and it measures 
approximately 4 km -- 1 km of this is submerged. The 
information says the pipeline will replace the old system, which 
used smaller boats to transfer the oil given the area water's 
shallow depth. Local nickel plants need more than 500,000 tons 
of crude oil per year and the use of small boats renderd 
operations extremely expensive. The state spent approximately 
$4 million on the new pipeline, but this will be recovered in 
about two years given the lower transportation expenses. The 
old system cost the country $500,000 per month.

  [Excerpt] Although some ships fly the Honduran flag, this 
does not necessarily mean they are Honduran, President Carlos 
Roberto Reina said yesterday in reference to the report that 
Honduran-flagged ships have violated the embargo against Haiti. 
  He considered it distressing and unfortunate that the United 
States and the inter-American system are about to adopt more 
drastic measures to reestablish democracy in Haiti. He also 
announced this topic will be addressed at the summit in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Donaldo Torres Argenal] </F>
  [Text] Petroleum-importing companies have threatened the 
government with discontinuing purchases of oil; therefore, 
rationing could result beginning 6 June if fuel prices are not 
deregulated. 
  According to sector businessmen, ever since the Economy 
Ministry made the decision to freeze fuel prices, they have been 
registering losses amounting in the millions. 
  Augusto Gigerbaud, manager of Distribuidora de Productos 
Derivados del Petroleo (DIPPSA) [a petroleum byproducts 
distributing company], has said if government officials do not 
reply to them within the next 48 hours, fuel rationing will 
commence nationwide beginning 6 June. 
<H5>  They Demand the Government Take Measures </H5>
  Gigerbaud has added they can no longer register such losses; 
therefore, it is necessary for the government to take immediate 
and extreme measures. Either our cost of the product is taken 
into consideration, or they must sacrifice their profit margin, 
he has said. 
  As to the freezing of fuel prices, the businessman has 
termed 
the measure as arbitrary and dangerous, due to the repercussions 
that could adversely affect importing companies. 
  Gigerbaud has reiterated the measure is arbitrary, because 
whenever the government has asked us to make a sacrifice or 
help, we have agreed to do so. 
  In this regard, the businessman has said that before 
President Carlos Roberto Reina made his presentation via 
television to mark his first 100 days in office, a member of his 
economic cabinet had called them three days before requesting 
that fuel prices not be increased. 
  Gigerbaud has said they are often asked to do this type of 
favor, and this is why they consider it unjust for the 
government not to make the correct decision, thereby creating a 
crisis. 
<H5>  Texaco and Esso Will Join </H5>
  The DIPPSA manager has said he is certain the multinational 
companies Esso and Texaco will also agree not to continue 
importing petroleum and to initiate rationing. 
  They cannot continue to support losses in the millions, as 
it 
is occurring with us, because these losses already total in the 
millions, the businessman has said. 
  EL PERIODICO has wanted to find out the opinion of the 
representatives of the multinationals, but the security 
personnel of both companies only stated the executives did not 
want to disclose any information, adding they had been ordered 
not to allow any members of the media inside the installations. 
<H5>  The Government Does Not Know How To Handle the Petroleum </H5>
Sector 
  Meanwhile, Henry Arevalo, DIPPSA executive president, has 
said that by freezing the prices of petroleum byproducts the 
government is demonstrating it does not have the capability to 
handle the petroleum sector. It has changed its petroleum 
policy several times within two months 
<H5>  A Crisis Draws Near </H5>
  According to Arevalo, these measures demand too much a 
sacrifice from them, cornering them to the extent they can no 
longer support these losses. Thus, the companies can no longer 
export petroleum. [sentence as published] 
  Arevalo has warned that if the situation persists, a large 
crisis could be created in the fuel supply, and the government 
would be solely responsible for not taking the correct measures. 
  He has said if additional purchases of petroleum abroad are 
not confirmed within the next three days, they will have to 
start rationing to stretch their inventories. Consequently, 
alarming situations will be produced. 
  Arevalo has reiterated that, until the government assumes 
its 
responsibility, they will no longer continue to import fuel. 
This would force the public sector in turn to supply the demand 
for which it does not have the capability. 
  The businessman has explained they do not wish to cause 
additional problems for the current administration; to the 
contrary, they would like to cooperate in every way possible so 
as not to adversely affect the community. 
  The only thing at which the government measure is aimed is 
not allowing them to recover their investment in importing 
petroleum. To recover the investment, fuel prices must be 
deregulated, because the value of this sector on the 
international market continues to rise, Arevalo has said. 
  In conclusion, the businessman has said the government's 
problem is "it starts to look for medicine when the patient is 
already in a coma." 
  [Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish on 4 June 94 on page 1, 
in a similar item, adds: "Economy Minister Delmer Urbizo Pating 
has warned the government will not negotiate anything under 
pressure, given the importers' decision not to continue the 
supplying of fuel. The minister has added that based on advice 
from a consultant of the World Bank, the price of fuel will be 
negotiated with the petroleum importers."]

  [Text] Guatemala City, June 3 (CNA) -- Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio Friday [3 June] reiterated his support for 
the Republic of China [ROC]'s bid to join the United Nations. 
  De Leon said his country will again put forth a proposal 
backing the ROC's membership bid during the UN's 49th General 
Assembly this year, even though a similar move was aborted last 
year. He made the remarks in a news conference held with ROC 
Premier Lien Chan at the Presidential Office. 
  Guatemala, along with six other Latin American countries, 
submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, 
asking the UN to put the ROC's UN bid on the agenda for the 48th 
General Assembly in September 1993. 
  Lien, leading a 21-member entourage, arrived here Thursday 
evening from El Salvador for a four-day official visit. 
  Lien paid his respects to the memory of Guatemala's national 
martyrs Friday morning. He was later given a key to Guatemala 
City before he called on the Guatemalan Parliament and 
Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias. 
  The Guatemalan Government also conferred a medal upon Lien 
for his promotion of friendly ties between the two countries. 
  De Leon held a luncheon to honor Lien and his entourage, 
which includes Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang, Vice 
Foreign Affairs Minister Fang Chin-yen, Vice Central Bank of 
China Governor Yu Cheng, and Government Information Office 
Director-General Jason Hu. 
  Guatemala is the second leg of Lien's Central American 
visit. 
Before he flew into Guatemala, Lien spent four days in El 
Salvador where he attended the inauguration of Salvadoran 
President Armando Calderon Sol. 
  Meanwhile, Economic Affairs Minister P. K. Chiang told the 
press here that the two countries will sign an investment 
guarantee agreement when De Leon visits Taipei in July. 
  Chiang's remarks came after the two countries held wide 
ranging talks on economic issues, including agriculture, animal 
husbandry, and trade and industry technological training. 
  According to Sun Ming-hsien, chairman of the Council of 
Agriculture, a bilateral agricultural cooperative agreement will 
be extended for five more years after it expires in November 
1995.

  [Text] The Nicaraguan Government has been putting off a 
decision regarding the Haitian refugees with the clear intent to 
avoid upsetting U.S. President Bill Clinton with a negative 
response. 
  This is inferred from Dona Violeta's remarks upon returning 
from El Salvador. She said that Nicaragua will respond to the 
United States in December with regard to receiving Haitian 
refugees. "I always said that all of us in Central America are 
studying the request and will announce our decision at the 
summit to be held with President Clinton in Miami in December," 
she said. 
  While the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa 
Rica have ruled out the possibility of their countries' 
receiving Haitian refugees, citing excessive poverty and a lack 
of proper conditions, Dona Violeta keeps saying that the request 
is being studied and that a decision will be made in December. 
  We must admit that this position -- a very intelligent one 
-- 
makes it possible for the Nicaraguan Government to gain time. 
According to international analysts, the problem created by the 
military in Haiti will have been resolved by December. The 
hypothesis that anything can happen between now and December is 
much more acceptable if we take into consideration the fact that 
Nicaragua will most likely support the U.S. proposal at the OAS 
to restore democracy in Haiti. The U.S. proposal for Haiti even 
considers the possibility of a military invasion, which, if 
approved, would take place very soon thereafter, because 
everything is ready. 
  It goes without saying that Nicaragua is in no position to 
receive refugees. We must admit, however, that Dona Violeta has 
already learned to deal with international politics. Too bad it 
is a little late.

<F P=106> [From the "Six O'Clock Sharp" newscast] </F>
  [Text] President Violeta Chamorro and Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo have only told U.S. Congressmen Cass Ballenger 
and Robert Torricelli that more effort will be made toward 
compensation payments. Chamorro and Lacayo have not said 
anything new. They are still offering the same they did three 
years ago. They repeated the same old argument -- that the 
privatization of the Nicaraguan Communications and Postal 
Services Institute will be used to back the payments. This is a 
clear sign that the government has no intention of returning 
those properties the Sandinistas divvied up. 
  U.S. Congressmen Robert Torricelli and Cass Ballenger are 
leaving today. Torricelli, Ballenger, and Nicaraguan Blanca 
Perez Macias -- formerly Bianca Jagger -- came last week to 
discuss several topics with the government, including the issue 
of confiscated properties and the need to return them to their 
true owners. They discussed political topics and U.S. 
investment in Nicaragua with military leaders, Cardinal Obando y 
Bravo, the private sector, and others. Although the congressmen 
were rather brief at the end, they clearly conveyed to the 
government that aid to Nicaragua might be stopped if properties 
are not returned to those Lacayo called the Nicaraguan caitudos 
[pejorative term for some Nicaraguans who are naturalized U.S. 
citizens]. The caitudos are claiming their properties as U.S. 
citizens. 
  [Begin recording] [(Roberto Basalli), president of the 
association of U.S. owners of confiscated properties] We know 
that from now until the end of July, it is impossible to 
entirely resolve the property issue, which is highly 
complicated. Our goal is that if the Nicaraguan Government 
shows enough progress, then aid will be given for a year. 
According to the amendment, the Secretary of State must, each 
year, confirm any progress made in countries where properties 
have been seized from U.S. citizens. 
  Consequently, if Nicaragua shows enough progress, it must 
receive aid for a year so that it has the opportunity to 
continue and finish resolving the problem. We are very aware 
that the problem cannot be resolved in 90 days. 
  [Unidentified Reporter] The first 30 days have already gone 
by [words indistinct]. Do not you think they might have used 
some sort of strategy to avoid resolving this problem? 
  [Basalli] We do not know precisely what the Nicaraguan 
Government is doing or plans to do. Thus far, there have been 
no results. However, we must give the Nicaraguan Government the 
benefit of the doubt because they might be preparing to make a 
move regarding this issue. [end recording]

  [Text] The Nicaraguan right is challenging the future 
military law. Sectors of the Nicaraguan right have launched a 
ferocious campaign against the future military code that will be 
approved in Congress and whose goal will be to subordinate the 
Armed Forces to the civilian authorities of this Central 
American nation. 
  Politicians from various political circles, politicized 
entrepreneurs, and certain lawyers have begun to voice their 
stand against the draft law that two Legislative Assembly 
committees will discuss today. 
  According to Oscar Herdocia, that military code will leave 
the Army as another power within the state, inasmuch as the 
military's decisionmaking powers will be reestablished with 
absolute independence. Herdocia said that the Armed Forces 
cannot be an autonomous entity independent of the state, but 
rather a body within the Executive Branch. 
  Francisco Mayorga, former president of the Central Bank of 
Nicaragua and leader of the rightist Nicaraguan Civic Movement, 
said that passing the draft military law will be like deceiving 
civilian power and the citizenry, because it will reestablish 
the appointment of a defense minister, who is empowered to 
supervise the behavior of the [words indistinct].

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
confirmed at noon on 4 June that Eduardo Duhalde will be his 
running mate on the 1995 presidential ticket if the latter is 
prevented from seeking his reelection as Buenos Aires Province 
governor. Duhalde publicly confirmed that this is indeed the 
case. 
  Speaking during a news conference he held at noon at 
Duhalde's Don Tomas villa in San Vicente, Menem also forecast 
that the PJ [Justicialist Party] will win next year's 
presidential elections "by obtaining 45 percent of the votes, 
and will beat the second largest vote-getter by more than 10 
percent." 
  Before the new conference, the chief executive dedicated 250 
new housing units in San Vicente's Eva Peron neighborhood. 
During this ceremony Menem said he was convinced that Duhalde 
will be given a chance to seek his reelection "provided the 
people of Buenos Aires start pushing for it." 
  Menem currently is playing a soccer match at the Don Tomas 
villa. He then will join Duhalde for a barbecue and watch the 
soccer match between Argentina and Croatia. Menem forecast that 
"the Argentine team will win 3-1" [Argentina and Croatia tied 
0-0].

Governor Eduardo Duhalde stated on 4 June that he is convinced 
that the provincial Constituent Assembly will approve the bill

be Menem's running mate in the 1995 presidential elections. 
  Speaking in San Vicente, Duhalde said he does not want the 
people of Buenos Aires Province to push for his reelection 
because this issue will be negotiated at the provincial

  [Excerpt] Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, 4 Jun (NA) -- Local 
Metalworkers Union (UOM) workers today accepted the agreement 
reached in the federal capital between UOM representatives and 
business by which the 18-day conflict was settled. 
  At the end of the workers assembly just before noon, an act 
on the decision made in the assembly was signed by the local UOM 
secretary general, Marcelo Sosa; Pedro Waisman, head of the 
Tierra del Fuego Industrial Union; and a Labor Ministry 
representative. 
  The act was signed during a meeting held by representatives 
of all the parties involved, in the this capital's Albatros 
Hotel. 
  During the assembly in this city's Augusto Lacerre Sports 
Center, which was headed by Marcelo Sosa in the presence of 
about 500 union members, the workers accepted all the points of 
the agreement announced in Buenos Aires on 3 June. 
  It was learned, however, that about 30 percent of the union 
members disagreed with the agreement establishing a gradual 
increase of 300 percent in one year -- which triples the basic 
salary of the national agreement in the household goods metal 
sector -- on a variable scale starting at 120 percent and 
increasing 20 percent per month, reaching 310 percent in one 
year. [figures as received] 
  The agreement's approval by the majority of the metalworkers 
put an end to 18 days of conflict including picket lines and 
threats of repression by Tierra del Fuego police. 
  At the assembly's end, Sosa said that "the workers decided 
to 
obey the agreement" reached in Buenos Aires on 3 June. Sosa 
accused businessmen by saying "we ran into an intransigent 
position by businessmen." 
  Sosa confirmed, however, that a new round of negotiations 
between workers and businessmen for the payment of the days not 
worked [salarios caidos] will begin in this city on 6 June, and 
that the talks will be held with each company. 
  The businessmen agreed to rehire the 127 workers dismissed 
from the Continental factory and the 63 dismissed from the Crown 
Mustang plant, which is located in Rio Grande, about 200 km from 
this capital. 
  The only unresolved point is the 15 days not worked, but it 
was learned here that an agreement probably will be reached to 
pay the days not worked during the conflict, but businessmen 
would demand that the workers compensate for the days not 
worked. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 2 Jun (AFP) -- National Police 
Commissioner Alonso Salamanca has admitted that police have 
violated human rights. He requested today that one official and 
two agents be investigated for torturing a union member. 
  In the first action he has taken as national police 
commissioner--a newly created post--Salamanca asked the local 
police commander to file charges against Captain Wilson Laverde 
and agents Cesar Cacua and Pedro Tangarife. According to a 
preliminary investigation, Laverde, Cacua, and Tangarife 
tortured union leader Luis Antonio Tellez physically and 
psychologically. 
  Tellez and his partner Aida Luz Martinez had been arrested 
for distributing subversive literature and throwing explosive 
devices to disturb public order during a march to commemorate 
Labor Day on 1 May. 
  According to the commissioner, the police tortured Tellez 
physically and psychologically to obtain a confession that was 
not a true assessment of the activities in which he was involved. 
  Criticizing the incident, Salamanca said this violation 
constitutes a serious attack against the validity of human 
rights and the image of the institution. Salamanca added that 
his office will follow very closely the progress of the 
investigation to be initiated by the local police commander. 
  The incident was revealed at a time the government is 
conducting a thorough review of human rights in order to improve 
the country's image before the international community. As part 
of this campaign, the government has scheduled a meeting with 
its 14 ambassadors in Europe on 9 June.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner on 3 
June recognized that Paraguayan settlers are having problems as 
a result of the filling of the Yacyreta hydroelectric dam. The 
minister said, however, that those problems are not reason 
enough to stage an aggression such as the one that occurred in 
Encarnacion in the afternoon of 2 June. During the incident a 
crowd threatened an Argentine official working for the Yacyreta 
Binational Entity [EBY] and then pushed his car into the river. 
  Ramirez Boettner met Raul Enrique Justo, minister adviser to 
the Argentine Embassy in Paraguay, at 13:25 on 3 June. Justo is 
temporarily heading the Argentine mission for Ambassador Raul 
Eduardo Carignano, who traveled to Santa Fe Province the day of 
the incident. 
  Justo conveyed to Ramirez Boettner the Argentine "concern" 
over the 2 June incident. The foreign minister said he shares 
Argentina's concern and promised to do his utmost to solve the 
social situation that is at a boiling point in the Encarnacion 
area. 
  The foreign minister on 3 June received a "top secret" 
[preceding two words in English] report from EBY's Paraguayan 
director, Antonio Adam Nill, about the incident staged by 
settlers. Ramirez Boettner did not want to elaborate on the 
document's contents, but said it was a report on what happened 
on 2 June. "We will study it in order to solve the problem," he 
added. 
  The foreign minister called on settlers to review their 
decision to prevent the entry of all Argentine and Paraguayan 
officials to the area until a solution is found because their 
position closes the possibilities of a dialogue. 
  Technical sources warned that Inter-American Development 
Bank 
(IDB) and World Bank technicians have expressed a very lukewarm 
position regarding the social problems of those affected by the 
dam's filling, adding that they even lean toward the Argentine 
position, which seeks to fill the dam at any cost. 
<H5>  Workers and Relocations </H5>
  The foreign minister conveyed to the Argentine Foreign 
Ministry, through Raul Enrique Justo, its concern about the 
situation of workers and the relocation of settlers living on 
Parana River islands because they also must be relocated and 
provided with basic services. 
  Regarding this point the Argentine foreign official said: "I 
don't have all the information at hand, but I will transmit the 
concern to my government and we will continue working to resolve 
these problems." 
  The two countries' Foreign Ministries promised to be in 
permanent contact to seek a quick solution to the problem raised 
by settlers and the lack of compensation pay. On 3 June, Ramirez 
Boettner traveled to Belem do Para to participate in the 24th 
OAS ordinary session that will meet from 6 to 11 June.

  [Text] On 6 June most of the members of the Congressional 
Investigating Committee on Illegal Activities (CBII) agreed to 
begin an in-depth investigation of the many reports of Army 
Commander General Lino Oviedo's involvement in 
political-partisan activities. 
  By the time this afternoon daily went to press, the CBII was 
getting ready to formally discuss the issue. The request for the 
CBII to step in came from Deputies Sergio Lopez of the PLRA 
[Authentic Radical Liberal Party] and Walter Bower of the 
Colorado Party Reconciliation Movement. The report that the two 
deputies prepared on the repeated charges against Gen. Oviedo 
will be submitted at today's session of the CBII. 
  Should it be duly proven that the Army commander has 
violated 
the Constitution, the CBII will submit its findings to the 
courts so that Gen. Oviedo can be tried, and will also ask the 
national executive branch to remove and retire the general, 
according to National Encounter Deputy Luis Alberto Mauro. 
  The CBII is controlled by the opposition, which has been 
constantly criticizing Gen. Oviedo's activities, and by the 
Colorado Party, which is now bitterly complaining about the role 
Oviedo is playing in the party's internal power struggle. 
  Committee members Basilio Nikiporoff, Armando Espinola, 
Fernando Pfannl, Hermes Rafael Saguier, and Luis Alberto Mauro 
belong to the opposition; Carlos Romero Pereira and Walter Bower 
belong to the Argana faction of the Colorado Party; and Luis 
Becker, who recently called Oviedo "little Stroessner," and 
"gangsters' protector," belongs to the pro-government faction of 
the Colorado Party. 
  Bearing this background in mind, it is certain that the 
majority of the CBII members will be in favor of investigating 
Gen. Oviedo. The only pro-government legislator who could oppose 
this decision would be Senator Emilio Cubas Grau. 
  Deputy Mauro stated that when last year CBII members accused 
Oviedo of meddling in politics "we were criticized and told that 
our attitude was antimilitary. It appears, however, that many 
members of the various Colorado Party factions now share our 
position." 
  He concluded: "This proves that our criticisms are 
objective, 
and not prompted by antimilitary feelings."

  [Text] Atilio R. Fernandez, former presidential election 
campaign director, on 3 June presented his government program 
within the framework of his campaign to head the ANR [National 
Republican Association--Colorado Party]. His speech started with 
a call "to civilian Colorados and military Colorados." The rally 
was attended by about 4,000 people, most of them top state 
officials and departmental and municipal authorities. 
  Many well-known leaders of the so-called "Stroessnerist 
militant faction" [former dictator Alfredo Stroessner's 
supporters], including Ramon Enrique Reverchon and Juan Jose 
Benitez Rickman, attended the rally. 
  The night's most noticeable item, without a doubt, was the 
large number of posters saying "Oviedo '98" [General Lino Oviedo 
for president in 1998], which was the exclusive responsibility 
of Guaira Governor Rodolfo Max Friedmann, according to the 
organizers. Eight of the total of 12 Colorado governors attended 
the meeting. 
  The event was opened by campaign spokesman and former 
Education Minister Horacio Galeano Perrone. After talking about 
the Colorado Party's internal divisions and its history, Galeano 
Perrone urged Colorado followers to work for unity without 
exclusions. At the end of his speech, Galeano Perrone emphasized 
that the faction headed by Fernandez did not accept the division 
between "military and civilians" and made an ardent call for 
unity within the party, "accepting the past with its lights and 
shadows." 
  Several sections of his speech were dedicated to lashing out 
at other internal movements despite his call for unity. 
  Among those attending were Paul Sarubbi and Gustavo Pedrozo 
and Deputies Bernardino Cano Radil and Conrado Pappalardo. The 
presence of Ramon Duarte Vera, the controversial former police 
chief during the Stroessner administration, also was noteworthy.

  [Text] Lima, 6 Jun (EFE) -- The Lima daily EXPRESO reported 
on 6 June that the police have thwarted an attempt by the maoist 
Shining Path [SL] gang to kill former Peruvian President 
Fernando Belaunde Terry (1980-1985). 
  EXPRESO reported that a man known as "Comrade Jonas" was 
arrested some 100 meters from the podium from which Belaunde 
Terry was addressing a rally at the main square in Huaraz, 
capital of Ancash Department in the northern Andean region. The 
arrested man was carrying a long-range weapon fitted with a 
silencer. 
  "Comrade Jonas" allegedly confessed that his mission was to 
"eliminate" the leaders of Popular Action, the party that 
Belaunde Terry founded and leads. 
  The police reported that three other SL members were 
arrested 
in Yungay, also in Ancash Department. 
  According to EXPRESO "Comrade Jonas" was involved in the 
murder of two Polish priests in May 1993 in Pariacoto, Ancash 
Department.

  [Text] Lima, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Peruvian Air Force (FAP) 
commander General Jose Nadal Paiva has resigned suddenly. 
General Enrique Astete replaced him as the FAP commander today. 
  Nadal submitted his resignation just as the U.S. Government 
halted the supply of radar obtained information to the FAP for 
use in the struggle against drug trafficking. According to 
military sources, the two are in no way connected. 
  The same sources stated that the Air Force commander 
resigned 
for "very personal reasons." Other sources stated that he 
resigned for health reasons. 
  Nadal Paiva should have retired, due to his age, in 1993 but 
continued following a decision by Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori, who is also commander in chief of the Armed Forces by 
a mandate of the Constitution. 
  The new FAP commander was the Air Force chief of staff and 
prior to that director of military operations and attache at the 
Peruvian Embassy in the United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Anel Cordero] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara could withdraw from the 
Legislative Assembly the draft bill on constitutional reforms, 
in which the abolition of the Panamanian Army is proposed as 
well as financial and administrative autonomy for the Electoral 
Tribunal. 
  Endara has acknowledged opposition had "emerged" ever since 
these constitutional reforms were presented. Various sectors of 
the community have expressed their rejection to these reforms, 
and this is why he is assessing their possible withdrawal from 
the assembly. 
  Nevertheless, Endara has said he personally agrees with the 
text of these reforms, which offer greater freedom of action and 
financial independence to the Electoral Tribunal. 
  In the name of the executive branch, Government and Justice 
Minister Jacobo Salas presented to the Legislative Assembly at 
the end of May a "package of reforms" to the Constitution that 
should be approved during the current assembly session and 
ratified by the next. 
  Up until now, the Legislative Assembly has not initiated the 
debate on this "package of reforms" to the Constitution, but 
political, professional, and even internal sectors of the 
assembly, have rejected it. 
  Endara has said that as of yet he has not decided if he will 
call special assembly sessions to discuss these reforms; 
nevertheless, he has said this is a possibility he is also 
contemplating. 
  The National Front for a Constituent Assembly (FRENO) last 
week reiterated its rejections of these reforms, affirming an 
overall revision must be made to the Constitution instead of 
"adding more bits and pieces." 
  FRENO has insisted on the need to call a constituent 
assembly 
to take charge of the drafting of a new constitutional text the 
nation requires in light of the changes that have occurred in 
the past years.

  [Text] Jose Javier Mulino, director of the National Office 
for Attention to Refugees [Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de 
los Refugiados -- ONPAR], said yesterday the Panamanian 
Government has installed a national commission formed by state 
and civic organizations to evaluate the situation and entry of 
refugees from Haiti and other nations into Panama. 
  This comission is formed by representatives of the 
Government, Labor, and Foreign Ministries, Immigration, State 
Security, ONPAR, UNHCR, and the Red Cross, among other 
organizations. The commission is analyzing the request made by 
the United States to permit the arrival of Haitian refugees in 
Panama. 
  Although Panama has not adopted an official position 
regarding the request, unofficial international reports indicate 
that the United States plans to transfer to Panama a total of 
5,000 Haitian refugees who are currently in Florida. 
  Nevertheless, Jose Javier Mulino denied that the national 
commission, ONPAR, and the UNHCR are studying the entry of such 
a large number of refugees, "because this country is not 
prepared to meet such expenses or deal with their presence here."

  [Text] The Cabinet Council has authorized the Foreign 
Ministry to proceed with the return of the building that has 
served as the Panamanian Embassy in Nicaragua for 14 years. An 
official document indicated that the building had been 
expropriated from its legitimate owner and donated to Panama. 
  According to the document, the Nicaraguan Government asked 
the Panamanian diplomatic mission in Nicaragua to return the 
building because it had been expropriated from its legitimate 
owner during the administration of Anastasio Somoza, who was 
killed after being overthrown by the Sandinists. 
  In 1982, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry decided to donate 
the building to the Panamanian Embassy in Managua. The building 
has served as residence for our diplomatic missions since then. 
  Through a "verbal note" on 17 February, the Nicaraguan 
Government notified the Panamanian Government that in order to 
correct actions committed by previous administrations, it is 
working to return property expropriated from Nicaraguans and 
foreigners. Therefore, it requested the return of the building 
being used by the Panamanian Embassy. 
  The Panamanian Government replied it has no objections to 
returning the building, specially if the donation was never 
legalized. Therefore, it authorized the Foreign Ministry to 
return the building through the Panamanian diplomatic mission in 
Nicaragua.

  [Text] Tehran, June 7, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday expressed optimism over further 
improvement in the international oil market in the current 
calendar year. The president was speaking at a press conference 
this morning with the participation of over 100 local and 
foreign reporters and cameramen. 
  "It seems that situation in the oil market would further 
improve this year," the president replied to a question. 
  On the impact of the recent visit to Iran of a group of 
American editors on Tehran-Washington relations, the president 
said: "Such a visit could have no impact on the relations but 
could shed further light on some of the realities for the 
American people." 
  As for Iran's view over the policy the British Government 
has 
adopted in former Yugoslavia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani told the 
reporters that there were evidences proving that Britain did not 
cooperate well to repel the Serbs aggressions. 
  Commenting on [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader] 
Zhirinovskiy's statement that Russia should dominate its 
southern neighboring countries including Iran, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers 
such statements as the viewpoints of an irresponsible individual 
and attaches no value to such words." 
  In reply to a question on situation in Iraq the president 
noted: "We had repeatedly condemned Iraqi aggressions in the 
past and believe that the Ba'th Party has treated the Iraqi 
people improperly. On the other hand, we believe that Saudi 
Arabia's measures claimed to be for the salvation of Iraqi 
people is not proper." 
  On the export of the Islamic revolution, the president said 
that the issue of the export of revolution has never been 
raised. "We have said that we would elucidate our ideology and 
those inhezed [as received] could accept it. We will employ all 
our potentials for the developmenf our country." 
  As for the future of Tehran-London ties, given the British 
bugging of the Iranian embassy, the president said that the 
outcome of Britain's illegal measure is mistrust in bilateral 
relations and we do not want to see such an atmosphere of 
mistrust prvail on our reations with other countries. 
  On fluctuations in foreign currency rates, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said measures were underway to adjust supply and demand in order 
to approach the single parity rate. He predicted that the 
actual foreign currency rate will appear in the coming months 
which he said would be lower than the current rates. 
  In reply to a question on the probable amendment of the 
Constitution to facilitate his re-election at the end of the 
presidential tenure, the president said he would rather prefer 
no change in the Constitution. "If I perform my duties properly 
within these eight years, I think there will be no need for 
re-electing me," he added. 
  On foreign investment in Iran President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said that there was no restriction on the investment of foreign 
countries within the framework of the Islamic Republic 
Constitution. 
  As for foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's participation 
in the Cairo Non-aligned Movement ministerial session, the 
president said that the visit did not imply a change in Iran's 
Middle East policy and Velayati's presence in Egypt was only for 
attending the meeting. 
  On Iran's cooperation with Central Asian republics despite 
U.S. hindrances, he said the areas of cooperation were so 
natural and vast that no one could stop it. However, he added, 
dimensions of cooperation might shrink due to foreign pressures, 
but, it should be noted that Iran and Central Asian region were 
complementary to each other and none could deny it. He also 
noted that Iran was determined to boost its cooperation with 
Asian countries. Cooperation within the framework of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) as well as bilateral 
cooperation with India and Malaysia were expanding, he said. 
  The president added that tripartite cooperation among Iran, 
Pakistan and India could lead to the formation of a great 
economic grouping in the region and in order to achieve this 
objective, the Indo-Pak differences should be settled. 
  On assassination of Iranian dissidents in some European 
countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the alleged involvement 
of Iranian officials in the killing of Iranian dissidents abroad 
is an unfounded allegation, adding that "we think that the 
killings are the result of inter-group rivalries". He 
underlined that Iran's policy is not to eliminate the dissidents 
but to encourage them to embrace Islam and return to their own 
country. 
  Commenting on the prospect of Iran-Egypt relations, the 
president said: "We believe that by signing the Camp David 
Accord, Egypt created a gulf among the anti-Zionist Muslim and 
Arab countries. Nevertheless we consider Egypt as a great 
Islamic country and welcome conditions enabling us to resume 
relations with that country." 
  In response to a question on Tehran-London relations, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no need to cut off 
relations, the two countries once witnessed the break-off of the 
relations and found out that it could not change anything. The 
relations, even though at a low level, should exist, we only 
react to any inappropriate action on their part, he added. 
  On Iran-U.S. trade relations, the president said that Iran 
has never broken off its trade relations with the U.S. "As for 
diplomatic relations with the U.S., we believe that the U.S. 
lacks goodwill and it has not taken a proper position during the 
post revolution era. The Americans are for dialogue but we 
think it will not be in our interest to start negotiations," he 
said. "If U.S. officials have good intentions, they should 
first release Iran's frozen assets," the president said. 
  The two countries have a broad trade cooperation, he 
reiterated, adding "a great deal of our military equipment is 
made in the U.S. and therefore we cannot throw away such a great 
national asset." 
  "We showed our goodwill by helping secure the release of 
American hostages in Lebanon but the Washington government did 
not keep its promise of releasing our frozen assets. This 
caused us to lose our trust in them," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. 
  In reply to a question as to reasons for inviting American 
editors to Iran, the president said that not all writers should 
be considered agents of the global arrogance. There are 
freedom-loving people working in foreign mass media who write 
the truth, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. He added that considering 
anti-Iranian propaganda in the U.S., the invitation of American 
journalists was a positive measure. 
  On claims of human rights abuses in Iran raised by the 
global 
arrogance, the president said that human rights were routinely 
violated in the West but "they (Western countries) are making 
hue and cry over the issue because their propaganda machine is 
stronger than ours." 
  "I openly declare that human rights are observed in the 
Islamic Republic better than in any other parts of the world and 
we are ready to debate with anybody who claims otherwise," he 
said. 
  Commenting on planned negotiations in tehran between 
belligerent parties in Tajikistan, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that 
the war was not in the interest of either Tajik government or 
people. He added that Iran would try to restore peace to that 
country in cooperation with the parties involved. On Iran's 
mediation efforts in Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute, he stressed 
that "although the mediation efforts have not been successful 
yet, we have not been disappointed." 
  The continuation of conflict will not benefit either 
Armenia, 
Azerbaijan or Karabakh, the president said, adding that Iran 
intended to launch new efforts to establish peace in the region. 
  In response to a question as to whether or not an Israeli 
pilot was held in Iran, he said for sure no Israeli pilot was in 
Iran. By raising such allegations, the Zionist regime is trying 
to cover up the kidnapping of four Iranians in Lebanon, the 
president said. The Westerners should not view the issue from 
their own self-interested perspective but should also be 
sensitive to the abduction of the four Iranians. 
  On the claim of the United Arab Emirates on the three 
Iranian 
islands in the Persian Gulf, the president warned "the United 
Arab Emirates will gain nothing from such claims and they have 
to cross a sea of blood in order to reach these islands." 
However, Hashemi-Rafsanjani voiced Iran's readiness to 
negotiate with UAE officials on the issue. 
  On Iran's stance on the current crisis in Yemen, the 
president said Iran was against the partition of Yemen, 
believing that Yemen should remain united. 
  He stressed that Iran was not after nuclear weapons, saying 
that this has been confirmed by inspectors of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who regularly visited Iran. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani added that "Iran is not for proliferation of 
nuclear arms but is for the nuclear disarmament of all 
countries. Every and each country should try to eliminate 
atomic weapons." 
  On the Middle East peace talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
"what 
is going on now is not peace because during the negotiations the 
rights of the Palestinian nation are denied." He reiterated 
that Iran was not going to interfere in the ongoing negotiations 
between Arabs and the Zionist regime.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mas'ud Khaleqi: "And Yet, There Is Room for </F>
Concern"-- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] On Tuesday 24 May, the esteemed Majles speaker, who 
attended a news conference with foreign and domestic 
correspondents, said in answer to a question put to him by a 
correspondent of Japan's NHK Television on what he thinks of the 
importation of American goods into the country and the 
possibility that these goods may affect the culture of Islamic 
Iran: "We are not concerned about the importation of some 
American goods into our country and the American culture that 
they can bring in. Our Islamic and national culture is too 
strong to be negatively affected by such minor issues...." 
  We too fully agree with the remarks by the esteemed Majles 
speaker, that our country has a rich and strong Islamic and 
national culture. But contrary to his view, we are extremely 
concerned over the importation of some American goods and the 
bad effects that this may have, and we believe that this issue 
should be studied from several aspects. In our opinion, we 
should pose this question from another angle and ask the 
esteemed Majles speaker: What vital need does our country have 
for American soft drinks and cigarettes? And what dangers can 
the banning of such imports have on our Islamic homeland? We 
should also recall that during last year's session of the G-7, 
the Americans placed the topic of banning the export of 
technology to Iran on their agenda and insisted--together with 
the British Government--that this decision be approved. And 
today, if in some part of the industrial world there is a 
country or a company that is transferring technology to Islamic 
Iran, it becomes the target of strong criticisms by the American 
bully.... And finally, the esteemed Majles speaker, who is a 
revolutionary figure with a bright record, definitely knows that 
the sale of American technology and of the diplomacy of 
exploiting this technology go hand in hand, as do their arms 
sales and arms policy. This point is so clear that it does not 
need any further explanation. 
  Therefore, if "some American goods" means items like Coca 
Cola, Pepsi Cola, cigarettes, chocolate, chips, and so on--that 
is, items for which the country has no need--the importation and 
sale of these items is an insult to the Muslim nation and to 
those who have shed their blood for this nation. And if 
American goods means technological products, then the Americans 
sell such products only if this sale is coupled with the 
acceptance--by the buyer--of the policy that they want to be 
accepted. But this is only one side of the coin. The other 
side of the coin should be sought in the views of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, when he boycotted American imports. 
We believe that opening up the market of Islamic Iran to 
American goods will fill the pockets of the bloodthirsty and 
plundering capitalists of that country with astronomical 
profits, and will greatly harm our economy, while also helping 
the Americans do what they usually do in other countries--that 
is, couple the export of their products with the export of their 
culture and influence. But the sagacious view of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, on the significance of boycotting 
American products is much more profound than this. A mere part 
of what he meant can be seen in his remarks that: The 
boycotting of American products will keep alive the deep 
hostility and spite as well as the memory of the crimes 
perpetrated by the Americans against our Muslim and oppressed 
nation in the minds of future generations and will prevent them 
from forgetting this hatred. 
  On the other hand, Islamic Iran has been recognized as the 
standard-bearer of pure Mohammedan Islam among the Muslim 
nations, and all facts show that the other Muslims consider 
Islamic Iran's actions to be an acceptable pattern that they too 
can follow. The boycotting of American products is tantamount 
to a line that is drawn between Islam and its major 
enemy--America. The answer to the question of why Islamic Iran 
has boycotted American goods shows the true identity of the 
great satan; and this is what our generation needs today. 
  Finally, we are well aware of the fact that the esteemed 
Majles speaker's remarks did not mean that he was issuing a 
permit for the import and sale of American goods, but that they 
referred to the wealth of our Islamic and national culture and 
an effort to remove any misgivings that the import of some 
American goods means that we will ignore the principle of not 
having relations with America. In another part of his news 
conference he also explicitly referred to this issue. However, 
the concern does exist that there will be some who will exploit 
part of his remarks.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab member countries 
of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] finally ended 
their two days of talks in Saudi Arabia with a statement that 
gave a seal of approval and legality to dismemberment of the 
Republic of Yemen through implicit recognition of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. 
  This is the first foreign reaction in support of Yemen's 
dismemberment, because even though the southern leaders of Yemen 
announced their independence at the start of the civil war, no 
foreign country has yet recognized Yemen's dismemberment or 
questioned its unity. 
  The stand taken by the GCC foreign ministers in the implicit 
recognition of Yemen's dismemberment is dangerous, the 
continuation of which could have disastrous consequences for 
Yemen as well for as the Arab and Islamic worlds. Among the six 
Arab countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, only 
Qatar voted against this decision, and took a unity-seeking 
stand on the developments in Yemen. 
  In their two days of talks the GCC foreign ministers not 
only 
failed to take a step toward solving the crisis of civil war in 
Yemen but worked toward continuing it. Political experts 
believe that the stand does not reflect the policies of the GCC 
countries than but rather the dangerous game that [Saudi] Arabia 
is pursuing under cover of the GCC. 
  Over and above the negative stand taken on the domestic 
crisis in Yemen, the rulers of Riyadh seek to push Yemen into an 
endless crisis and thus forever forget the issue of the three 
oil-rich provinces that have been occupied by [Saudi] Arabia for 
decades. 
  The three provinces were occupied by Saudi Arabia in the 
1930's and were supposed to be returned to Yemen after 30 years, 
in the 1960's. But due to the civil war at that time in Yemen, 
Saudi Arabia managed to delay the deadline for another 30 years. 
  Recently, with Yemen's insistence on the return of the three 
provinces, Riyadh again sought to intensify civil war and to 
delay the deadline for the return of Yemen's occupied 
territories. Political experts therefore believe that the result 
of the GCC foreign ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia was merely 
a political pretext for Saudi Arabian diplomacy. Riyadh's 
policy of causing civil war in Yemen follows the failure of 
repeated attempts by Saudi Arabian leaders to weaken united 
Yemen through transferring political, economic, and security 
crises into that country. 
  Parallel to Riyadh's efforts to perpetuate Yemen's domestic 
crisis by recognizing the Aden government in the south, Saudi 
Arabia also seeks to create and magnify a pseudo-crisis in the 
region, hoping thus to divert public opinion in the region's 
nations from their own policies of discord. 
  The plan, or to be more precise, the creation of a so-called 
issue of the three islands and efforts to create differences 
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates is also within this 
context. But this weapon is now increasingly losing its 
effectiveness with the gradual publication of legal and historic 
documents by official international sources regarding the 
sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands.

  [Text] Tehran, June 4, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry here 
today reiterated that the three Lesser and Greater Tunbs as well 
as Abu Musa Islands belonged to Iran according to the historical 
documents, and welcomed talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE) 
without any precondition. 
  Mahmud Mohammadi, a Foreign Ministry's spokesman, referred 
to 
the final communique of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council 
(PGCC) Sunday night [5 June], and said the communique did not 
reportedly pass unanimously, and that all six PGCC ministers 
were not present at the time of approval. 
  However, he stressed that according to the historical 
documents the islands have always belonged to Iran, and said 
Iran has always welcomed mutual talks with UAE without any 
precondition. "The invitation for Shaykh Hamdan is still 
valid," he added. 
  Prominent university scholars in a recent seminar in Paris 
reviewed the historial documents on Iran's ownership of the 
islands. 
  On the Saudi protest to the Iranian media reports concerning 
Saudi Arabia, which had been included in the PGCC final 
communique, Mohammadi said Iranian media "are totally free". 
  "The media in Iran criticize also formal policies of the 
country most of the time, and our neighbours should understand 
this reality," he said adding "on the other hand it is natural 
that the media would react when they see the negligence of an 
agreement." 
  Mohammadi also refuted the claims of Iran's support and 
military aid to one of the warring sides in Yemen, and said Iran 
had expressed its regret over the clashes and opposed any 
military operations in Yemen. The Islamic Republic adopted an 
impartial position and announced its readiness for mediation in 
Yemen, he said. 
  More on the issue the spokesman said Iran is deeply 
interested in the integrity of the Islamic countries, whose 
disintegration, he said, are provoked by the foreigners. "We 
support the settlement of disputes in a peaceful way." 
  "We are deeply sorry for the killing of each and every 
Muslim 
whether in the north or in the south, and we invite the two 
sides to end the clashes and begin talks with the aim of 
preservation of Yemen's unity," he said. 
  Mohammadi also invited other countries to show self-restrain 
and avoid flaming the tension.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon the Thai ambassador in Tehran 
was summoned to the Foreign ministry and handed a note of 
protest by the deputy foreign minister and head of the 
Department for Southern and Eastern Affairs. The Central News 
Unit reports this note protested the arrest of several Iranians 
on the trumped-up charges of their attempting to blow up the 
Zionist regime's embassy in Bangkok and also to related 
interviews by Thai officials. 
  In this note of protest, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
demanded an immediate response from the Thai Government and has 
asked for documented proof of the charges brought against the 
Iranian nationals. It has also asked the Thai Government to 
arrange a meeting between officials of the Islamic Republic's 
consulate in Bangkok and the accused.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the 209th issue of KORDESTAN magazine; date </F>
not given: "Let Us Not Forget the Political Prisoners" ] 
  [Text] The inhuman crimes and acts that the Islamic 
Republic has been perpetrating against the people of our 
country, and especially against its political opponents during 
its more than 15 years of rule, have made the world realize its 
nature as a state completely against freedom. This is why not a 
year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the 
world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being 
criticized on a world level. 
  Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are 
perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen 
and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the 
regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been 
thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because 
of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms, 
while thousands have received the death penalty. 
  Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to 
the 
inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the 
Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many 
occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts 
such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion, 
depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of 
girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological 
and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the 
situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no 
documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types 
of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against 
political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only 
list the duties that the families and relatives of the political 
prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and 
organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations 
have toward these political prisoners. 
  If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship 
and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we 
believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the 
full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the 
strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we, 
those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness 
of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and 
organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human 
values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing, 
we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political 
prisoners in Iran are concerned. 
  We would first like to list the duties of the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some 
time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is 
no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the 
combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on 
charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and 
families of the political prisoners should use every possible 
means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any 
information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as 
their name, age, educational background, profession, political 
activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and 
whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand 
over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned 
relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and 
Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they 
should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by 
those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to 
reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers. 
  Many of these duties do not concern only the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every 
respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a 
next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his 
duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well 
as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are 
in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with 
this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving 
the necessary information to the competent circles, they should 
also be active in another field. They should become a backbone 
and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous 
psychological and material problems because their daughter, son, 
or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses 
sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and 
strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting 
the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands 
which are the demands of the majority of the people in our 
country as well. 
  A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed 
torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the 
freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are 
appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families 
and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should 
organize protest movements related to the political prisoners 
and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials, 
publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the 
true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to 
meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis, 
provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them 
access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to 
read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should 
be neutralized, and especially when representatives of 
organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the 
situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to 
organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives 
of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are 
facing. 
  Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle 
against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the 
documents and information that they acquire through their 
members and supporters and through the people of our country in 
connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces 
have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations, 
newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such 
information and documentation, they should pay more attention to 
directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to 
further informing them of the duties that they have toward the 
political prisoners. 
  During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have 
strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the 
political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more 
cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations 
and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their 
efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely 
reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the 
global level today. 
  Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the 
Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other 
world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed 
the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners. 
But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these 
organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of 
political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about 
a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for 
this is that the governments of the world have not attached 
great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights 
organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the 
antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their 
political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic. 
  It is by taking these facts into consideration that 
pro-human 
rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities 
who consider their struggle against the massacre of 
freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should 
mobilize world public opinion and place governments under 
pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of 
fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers. 
  We hope that everyone will help to serve the political 
prisoners of Iran.

<F P=106> ["Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad Javad </F>
Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and member of the Supreme 
National Security Council: "Occupied Palestine and the Middle 
East Situation"] 
  [Text] 1. It is possible that the situation in occupied 
Palestine may appear rather erratic: On the one hand, the 
people in Gaza and Jericho celebrated the departure of the 
Zionist soldiers and on the other hand one of the most intense 
armed clashes took place between the Palestinian combatants and 
the Israelis in al-Khalil [Hebron]. 
  Is there a dichotomy among the Palestinians? Does this mean 
that there is one group that is in favor of jihad against the 
Zionist regime and another that is seeking a normal life--even 
though vicarious--on the sidelines of this regime? We should 
view the issue in a more comprehensive manner. What will the 
changes in the Palestinian movement be, the political role of 
the Middle East and even of the regions beyond it in light of 
current political moves in the region in which the United 
States, Israel and the West have used all their weight? 
  2. The motives behind the moves of the United States and 
Israel with regard to the Palestinian movement and the intifadah 
are quite clear. They obviously want them to be snuffed out as 
soon as possible. Military pressure has not yielded any results 
and efforts to sow political discord have also not been able to 
drive a wedge in the ranks. The only hope that is left for them 
is that the intifadah should be contained within narrow 
geographical confines and should be pitted against 'Arafat's 
forces. 'Arafat should be given serious support (military, 
political, financial, and propagandistic) and what the Zionist 
regime was unable to achieve, should be done by 'Arafat. What 
should the Islamic movement do in such circumstances? 
  In my opinion, the current dual policy is the best one! In 
Gaza and Jericho, the Islamic movement should not become 
embroiled with pro-'Arafat forces who until yesterday were among 
the ranks of the intifadah. They should be strongly inducted 
into the management! Outside the confines of the autonomous 
region, the intifadah should continue with all its strength. 
There is no doubt that 'Arafat and Israel are apprehensive of 
any kind of victory of the Islamic forces in all kinds of 
elections and their effective participation in the management. 
Some reports indicate that Israel prefers that 'Arafat 
personally be in charge of administrative affairs for some time, 
and that there be no elections. 
  In either case, the path will be opened for the victory of 
the Muslims, that is, if there are elections and they win or if 
there is a dictatorship and 'Arafat's supporters stand behind 
him. 'Arafat will be forced to ask the Israelis for assistance 
once again for his own perpetuation and the extent of the 
intifadah will continue in its own sphere of action! 
  3. Worry with regard to the assessments that I have 
mentioned above have motivated the United States and Israel to 
pay attention to the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran as 
regards the course of the intifadah and they are exceedingly 
afraid of the spiritual and political effect of our stances. 
The strong stance of the U.S. secretary of state during his 
address to a gathering of Jews in New York is a clear indication 
of this fear. 
  Thus, the fabrication of a new preoccupation with regard to 
Iran has been placed on the agenda. Perhaps the most 
appropriate pretext and in fact, one on which they would have 
greater control would be some Arab countries in the Persian 
Gulf. An important point that merits the attention of the 
officials of Islamic Iran and the regional governments is: Our 
friends in the littoral states of the southern Persian Gulf 
should know that the United States does not have the ability to 
bring about a change of regime in Baghdad! The United States 
has extracted an exorbitant price for this promise so far. 
Therefore, it is seeking to clear its ledger, in practice, by 
its propaganda of a stronger threat, such as Iran. Right from 
the outset, it was clear that the United States did not have the 
ability to fulfill its promise, as Iraq is not a Panama or a 
Grenada! Even if it were, it would not have been to the benefit 
of the region that the door be opened to such intervention by 
the United States. This means that the sole path that remains 
for maintaining stability and peace in the Persian Gulf region 
is collective cooperation among the regional countries and that 
is all! 
  4. The Washington echelons have recently broken a world 
record in tactlessness: Their policy from the PRC, Japan, all 
the way to the Middle East and Iran is characterized by an 
egocentricity and stupidity which is the best way to describe 
their stances and behavior. 
  In such circumstances, our foreign policy should be based 
entirely on the main axes of our national interests with extreme 
poise and we should refrain from getting involved in 
controversial and marginal issues, regardless of whether these 
controversial issues pertain to any links with the IRA or are 
provocations in the form of awarding literary prizes to Salman 
Rushdie. 
  We have a momentous task ahead of us: To support the great 
Islamic renaissance [preceding word in French] and to prove that 
in today's world, we can transform our Islamic country into a 
modern and advanced country. Every step that we take forward 
toward the attainment of this objective is the biggest slap in 
the face of the enemies of dear Iran, proud Islam, and the great 
movement that our nation has brought about in the Islamic world.

  [Text] Athens, June 4, IRNA -- The 12-member European Union 
(EU) and the Islamic Republic of Iran have decided to continue 
their dialogue to promote and widen relations following talks 
between EU and Iranian officials in Athens Friday. 
  "We have decided to continue our discussion and exchange of 
views on various issues of mutual interest," 'Ali Ahani, 
director general for West European affairs at Iran's foreign 
ministry, told IRNA in an interview Saturday. 
  It was the third round of meeting between Iran and the EU. 
The first two rounds were held in Copenhagen and Brussels. 
  The Iranain delegation, led by deputy foreign minister for 
Euro-American affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi and the EU troika, headed 
by Greek Foreign Under Secretary George Papandreou, held 
marathon 3-hour talks yesterday. 
  The EU troika consists of the former, the current and the 
forthcoming holder of the rotating EU presidency, namely 
Belgium, Greece and Germany. 
  "We have very good relations with all the EU countries, in 
economic, political and cultural fields. But we should try to 
have the same level of cooperation with the EU in its totality," 
said Ahani. 
  Asked to comment on the recent expulsion of an Iranain 
diplomat from London and a British diplomat from Tehran, Ahani 
said he hoped the matter has now closed and there would be no 
further expulsions. 
  "I hope it will be stopped. We don't want to have tension in 
relations with any EU member," he said. The tensions were 
created by the British side, Ahani added. 
  The Iranian delegation left Athens Saturday after a 2-day 
visit during which they met Greek government officials and 
discussed bilateral political, economic and cultural ties. 
  Va'ezi was received by Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreau, the current euprht welcomed the expansion of 
Athens-Tehran ties and also Iran's relations with the EU. 
  Ahani said Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will be 
visiting Tehran next week to continue discussions on bilateral 
relations and on regional and international issues. 
  Pointing that Greece currently holds the EU Presidency, 
Ahani 
said the Greek Minister's visit will offer an important 
opportunity to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf region, 
the Balkans And europe. 
  Ahani described Greek-Iranian relations as "excellent."

  [Text] Larnaca, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] IRNA -- Last 
Wednesday the Cyprus Government expelled 30 Iranians, several of 
whom had just arrived at Larnaca Airport the same day. 
  One of the expelled Iranians, Reza Payami, said: The reason 
for expelling this group still has not been announced by the 
Cyprus police. 
  He said their expulsion was likely related to a theft that 
took place two weeks ago at a household appliances store. 
  Another of the individuals expelled said without giving his 
name: I was arrested by the Larnaca police as soon as I reached 
the airport. 
  He also claimed that the airport police tried in various 
ways 
to take the $1,800 he had away from him. 
  He said that he was forced to sell some of his household 
furnishings to make his trip to Cyprus possible. 
  A number of these expelled Iranians, citing deception or 
extortion of Iranians seeking work in Cyprus, asked Iran's 
embassies to cooperate with Iranians seeking work in various 
countries.

  [Text] Tehran, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
News Service -- Following the dissolution of the apartheid 
regime and the participation of all races in the national 
elections in South Africa, Iran's political and economic 
relations with this country, which were cut off in 1980 after 
the triumph of the Islamic revolution of Iran, were resumed. 
  The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to 
supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for 
the announcement of the results of the South African elections, 
in order on that basis to organize relations with the next 
government in Pretoria. 
  Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349 
[21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at 
that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in 
Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations 
between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90 
percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran. 
Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National 
Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in 
South Africa. In addition to its participation in the 
construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned 
17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's 
shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30 
percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil 
and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent. 
  In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels 
per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus 
Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5 
percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery. 
  Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran 
National 
Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was 
required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf. 
Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million 
tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the 
time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons 
of crude oil had been delivered to this country. 
  In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign 
affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South 
Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed 
based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its 
oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such 
that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares 
to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and 
prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African 
elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian 
Government can resume its relations with this country. 
  These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian 
regime's 
oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa 
made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner 
after Israel. 
  The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa 
cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium. 
Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the 
two countries were active importing and exporting and selling 
Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Here Comes Tagging"] </F>
  [Text] The costly war with Iraq is primarily responsible 
for our chronic economic difficulties. No right-thinking 
Iranian had expected life to be comfortable after the guns fell 
silent in 1988. The common masses, who are the supporters of the 
Islamic Revolution and sacrificed their near and dear ones in 
the 8-year-old war, knew that the post-war era would be 
problematic. 
  As is the case in such circumstances, the poor and middle 
class are always called on to make concessions. They have been 
ready to do their share every time and in many instances, much 
more than would be normally expected of them. 
  Speaking strictly of the economic health of the majority of 
our people, almost six years after Iraq's military aggressions 
ended we can at best say the situation has been deteriorating. 
To say the least the government of President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani seems to have entirely put the fate of the 
economy in the hands of `market forces'. Our economic planners 
have generally been unsuccessful and this bitter reality is 
clearly visible in the market itself. 
  Prices of goods and services have jumped to between 50 to 
250 
percent in the past few months. Chaos rules supreme in the 
bazaars to the extent that the business community refuses to 
acknowledge even the basic principles of trade not to mention 
the frontiers of human relations, ethics and respect for the 
rule of law. One lady shopper says of the retailers and 
shop-owners "they have full freedom to raise prices". In an 
area of a few hundred meters, prices differ as much as 20 to 30 
percent `depending on the conscience and justice' of the seller. 
  For years, we have heard our statesmen talk about the need 
to 
build a society on the foundation of social justice and economic 
morals. There is no death of seminars, conferences and 
gatherings where economic and social planners stick to the 
rhetoric of directing and sustaining our Muslim society, free 
from discrimination and injustice. But, whether we like it or 
not, the fundamental truth is that rhetoric has far outstripped 
reality. People with fixed incomes are doomed as their 
purchasing power declines every day and along with it their 
morale and tolerance. 
  This week the minister of commerce announced that it is 
compulsory to put price tags on commodities. It's a too little 
and too late a move. As far as our information goes, this 
measures also does not carry enough weight and was reportedly 
not coordinated with other related institutions and ministries. 
The tagging is no relief at all. Experience teaches us that 
this move is yet another gimmick to `stabilize the market', will 
have the same fate as hundreds of its predecessors. 
  Looking at the way ministries have functioned in the recent 
past, observers feel the government is equally to be blamed for 
the frightening confusion, as the middlemen and opportunists. 
They believe the government has exacerbated the already high 
inflation rate and slow economic growth--all of which have 
worsened the country's socio-economic problems and eroded the 
financial stability of the middle class. 
  Then there is the dollar disease. Everything from pin to 
plane is calculated on the `$ price'. Education, housing and 
medical services are gradually getting out of reach for the 
ordinary working class, as our policymakers are increasingly 
forgetting that these three basics are rights and not privileges. 
  We are always given sermons about falling revenues due to 
the 
drop in oil prices. Of course the oil argument cannot be 
regarded as total nonsense. No doubt that too is a factor, but 
let's not forget that all developing countries do not survive on 
oil. They select and elect the right people for key positions. 
Honesty, efficiency and merit are the criteria of appointments 
in majority of the states if not all. Thank God, most of our 
officials are certainly honest and God-fearing persons and some 
are competent too. In view of the current socio-economic 
problems in the country effective action should be taken to find 
similar people for the middle and lower ranking government 
positions also. 
  Nevertheless the people would like to see what the Commerce 
Ministry's tagging will bring in its wake. It has become 
apparent that the government's influence in maintaining economic 
order is slight to almost non-existent.

  [Text] Concurrent with the unprecedented intensification of 
the economic and social crisis in the country and increasing 
mass protests by an exasperated public, reports have been 
received of the spread of student strikes. 
  Following the student strike at Martyr Beheshti University 
in 
Tehran (formerly the National University), which began as a 
strike by women students against the unworkable situation at the 
student dormitories and quickly spread throughout the 
university, the strike continued for a week with a demand for 
the firing of the university management. 
  Based on this report, whose details are still unclear, 500 
accounting students at Tehran's 'Alameh Tabataba'i University 
staged a strike on 7 and 8 Esfand last year [26-27 February 
1994] demanding the firing of the university president. 
Likewise, officials at Qom's Fatemieh University closed the 
academic term in the face of an extensive student strike against 
this university's excessive tuition increase. 
  The leaders of the regime of the "vice regency of the chief 
jurisconsult," who remember well the experience of the student 
strikes of the years 1355-56 [21 March 1976-20 March 1978] and 
their connection with a mass movement during the Bahman [21 
January-19 February] revolution, have undertaken a terrified 
search for a solution, believing that by "dealing" with some of 
the class demands of the students they will prevent the student 
movement from spreading and becoming a national political 
movement. In this regard, in a note in the budget passed for 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the Majles has required the 
Central Bank to "provide the relevant universities with 10 
billion tumans through the banking system in the form of 
interest-free or participatory loans and other devices to 
complete and build student dormitories."

  [Text] Caracas Governor Asdrubal Aguiar has threatened to 
use the Armed Forces if a transportation stoppage leaves Caracas 
without this public service. He has said if the service is 
interrupted, the executive will have no other recourse but to 
implement measures to deal with such a contingency. The 
transportation sector cannot be permitted to defend its own 
rights by harming the community, which has already shown 
considerable tolerance to the increase in the cost of living. 
  Aguiar has said his office has been monitoring the situation 
between the mayor's office and Simon Lavera, president of the 
Central Federation of Roving and Terminal-Based Passenger 
Vehicles, regarding fares. Aguiar has announced that willingly 
or unwillingly, the government will prevent the strike with the 
resources as provided by the de jure state so the rest of the 
community will not be harmed. 
  [Begin Aguiar recording] We do not have to come up with 
emergency measures, which already exist, as do plans utilizing 
the Armed Forces and National Guard to tend to these situations. 
It will also be necessary to devise complementary measures to 
prevent any provocation or pressure. We will study these 
measures and be prepared to implement them. [end recording] 
  Mentioning the high crime rate, Aguiar expressed favor over 
organizational measures and announced the National Guard's 
cooperation to act in the so-called security areas, while the 
police would protect the people with squad cars and motorcycles.

  [Text] General Moises Shriqui, the Armed Forces Chief of 
Staff, yesterday referred to statements by former labor union 
leader Juan Lechin regarding a future rapprochement between the 
armed institution and the peoples' organizations. He denied a 
possible coup d'etat as a result of an alleged reduction of 
troops. 
  Lechin said the U.S. Government fears rapprochement between 
the Armed Forces and peoples' organizations. He praised the 
role of the military since the country returned to democracy. 
  Shriqui told PRESENCIA: "We are very pleased with his 
comments, and he is quite right. Mr. Lechin deserves our 
respect as a combatant who has always struggled for the workers' 
needs. If at times we may have been adversaries, as he stated, 
it was only for constitutional reasons." 
  Lechin also warned that the Latin American military would 
stage a coup if the U.S. continues to demand a reduction of the 
Armed Forces and that the Bolivian military would adopt a 
similar attitude. 
  Shriqui said: "That is what Lechin says, maybe we should ask 
him why he says that." 
  The journalist insisted: "What do the Armed Forces think?" 
  The military chief answered: "We abide by the Constitution 
and are determined to defend it. We remain aware of the 
situation within the country." 
  Lechin admitted that in the past he criticized the Armed 
Forces due to its involvement in politics. The old union leader 
said: "I have dreamed of a productive Army, whose ideal was to 
have soldiers carrying rifles but dressed in overalls." 
  He added that the people will never allow the elimination of 
the Armed Forces.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Mas'ud Khaleqi: "And Yet, There Is Room for </F>
Concern"-- punctuation as published] 
  [Text] On Tuesday 24 May, the esteemed Majles speaker, who 
attended a news conference with foreign and domestic 
correspondents, said in answer to a question put to him by a 
correspondent of Japan's NHK Television on what he thinks of the 
importation of American goods into the country and the 
possibility that these goods may affect the culture of Islamic 
Iran: "We are not concerned about the importation of some 
American goods into our country and the American culture that 
they can bring in. Our Islamic and national culture is too 
strong to be negatively affected by such minor issues...." 
  We too fully agree with the remarks by the esteemed Majles 
speaker, that our country has a rich and strong Islamic and 
national culture. But contrary to his view, we are extremely 
concerned over the importation of some American goods and the 
bad effects that this may have, and we believe that this issue 
should be studied from several aspects. In our opinion, we 
should pose this question from another angle and ask the 
esteemed Majles speaker: What vital need does our country have 
for American soft drinks and cigarettes? And what dangers can 
the banning of such imports have on our Islamic homeland? We 
should also recall that during last year's session of the G-7, 
the Americans placed the topic of banning the export of 
technology to Iran on their agenda and insisted--together with 
the British Government--that this decision be approved. And 
today, if in some part of the industrial world there is a 
country or a company that is transferring technology to Islamic 
Iran, it becomes the target of strong criticisms by the American 
bully.... And finally, the esteemed Majles speaker, who is a 
revolutionary figure with a bright record, definitely knows that 
the sale of American technology and of the diplomacy of 
exploiting this technology go hand in hand, as do their arms 
sales and arms policy. This point is so clear that it does not 
need any further explanation. 
  Therefore, if "some American goods" means items like Coca 
Cola, Pepsi Cola, cigarettes, chocolate, chips, and so on--that 
is, items for which the country has no need--the importation and 
sale of these items is an insult to the Muslim nation and to 
those who have shed their blood for this nation. And if 
American goods means technological products, then the Americans 
sell such products only if this sale is coupled with the 
acceptance--by the buyer--of the policy that they want to be 
accepted. But this is only one side of the coin. The other 
side of the coin should be sought in the views of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, when he boycotted American imports. 
We believe that opening up the market of Islamic Iran to 
American goods will fill the pockets of the bloodthirsty and 
plundering capitalists of that country with astronomical 
profits, and will greatly harm our economy, while also helping 
the Americans do what they usually do in other countries--that 
is, couple the export of their products with the export of their 
culture and influence. But the sagacious view of our late imam, 
may his soul be sanctified, on the significance of boycotting 
American products is much more profound than this. A mere part 
of what he meant can be seen in his remarks that: The 
boycotting of American products will keep alive the deep 
hostility and spite as well as the memory of the crimes 
perpetrated by the Americans against our Muslim and oppressed 
nation in the minds of future generations and will prevent them 
from forgetting this hatred. 
  On the other hand, Islamic Iran has been recognized as the 
standard-bearer of pure Mohammedan Islam among the Muslim 
nations, and all facts show that the other Muslims consider 
Islamic Iran's actions to be an acceptable pattern that they too 
can follow. The boycotting of American products is tantamount 
to a line that is drawn between Islam and its major 
enemy--America. The answer to the question of why Islamic Iran 
has boycotted American goods shows the true identity of the 
great satan; and this is what our generation needs today. 
  Finally, we are well aware of the fact that the esteemed 
Majles speaker's remarks did not mean that he was issuing a 
permit for the import and sale of American goods, but that they 
referred to the wealth of our Islamic and national culture and 
an effort to remove any misgivings that the import of some 
American goods means that we will ignore the principle of not 
having relations with America. In another part of his news 
conference he also explicitly referred to this issue. However, 
the concern does exist that there will be some who will exploit 
part of his remarks.

<F P=106> [From the Foreign Policy Desk: "The United States, Saudi </F>
Arabia, and the Policy of Fomenting Tension in the Region"] 
  [Text] Every once in a while, U.S. officials address issues 
concerning the important Persian Gulf region and express the 
stances of their government on the political and security 
aspects of the issues. Even though these utterances may be 
projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise 
examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned 
U.S. objectives. 
  In this regard, the presidential adviser for national 
security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian 
Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks, 
in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of 
the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy 
of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers 
from both these countries to the regional countries. 
  Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual 
containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding 
of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S. 
foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is 
paving the way for a greater presence in the region. 
  In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of 
"extremism." Dividing it into religious and national extremism, 
he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and 
the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently 
used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they 
actually mean by this term. 
  Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of 
Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf 
officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with 
the usual concept. 
  From Washington's point of view, the term "extremism" 
applies 
to any individual or government not willing to officially 
recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries 
around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not 
succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they 
have not yet presented any specific definition of this term. 
  For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a 
conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried 
out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last 
resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately, 
in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by 
false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the 
subsequent struggle is labeled extremism. 
  Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and 
Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism. 
While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against 
Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United 
States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States 
should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure 
of communism. 
  Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of 
dominating 
the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that 
progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern 
countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy 
and the lives of their people instead of squandering their 
resources purchasing weapons. 
  The realities in the region however belie his allegations. 
The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain, 
Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples 
of this fact. The White House adviser on national security 
affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been 
stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use 
is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs. 
  In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting 
the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between 
that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new 
front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations. 
  The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state 
to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding 
the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims 
of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of 
generating tension in the region. 
  Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is 
part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the 
region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into 
the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following 
precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to 
raise tension. 
  In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King 
Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded 
to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the 
handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the 
UAE. 
  These remarks can only result in raising tension in the 
region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune 
for the region, with more domination and profit making by the 
United States. The Saudi king has thus taken a new step toward 
disrupting the sensitive situation in the Persian Gulf region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] The foreign ministers of the Arab member countries 
of the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] finally ended 
their two days of talks in Saudi Arabia with a statement that 
gave a seal of approval and legality to dismemberment of the 
Republic of Yemen through implicit recognition of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. 
  This is the first foreign reaction in support of Yemen's 
dismemberment, because even though the southern leaders of Yemen 
announced their independence at the start of the civil war, no 
foreign country has yet recognized Yemen's dismemberment or 
questioned its unity. 
  The stand taken by the GCC foreign ministers in the implicit 
recognition of Yemen's dismemberment is dangerous, the 
continuation of which could have disastrous consequences for 
Yemen as well for as the Arab and Islamic worlds. Among the six 
Arab countries on the southern shores of the Persian Gulf, only 
Qatar voted against this decision, and took a unity-seeking 
stand on the developments in Yemen. 
  In their two days of talks the GCC foreign ministers not 
only 
failed to take a step toward solving the crisis of civil war in 
Yemen but worked toward continuing it. Political experts 
believe that the stand does not reflect the policies of the GCC 
countries than but rather the dangerous game that [Saudi] Arabia 
is pursuing under cover of the GCC. 
  Over and above the negative stand taken on the domestic 
crisis in Yemen, the rulers of Riyadh seek to push Yemen into an 
endless crisis and thus forever forget the issue of the three 
oil-rich provinces that have been occupied by [Saudi] Arabia for 
decades. 
  The three provinces were occupied by Saudi Arabia in the 
1930's and were supposed to be returned to Yemen after 30 years, 
in the 1960's. But due to the civil war at that time in Yemen, 
Saudi Arabia managed to delay the deadline for another 30 years. 
  Recently, with Yemen's insistence on the return of the three 
provinces, Riyadh again sought to intensify civil war and to 
delay the deadline for the return of Yemen's occupied 
territories. Political experts therefore believe that the result 
of the GCC foreign ministers meeting in Saudi Arabia was merely 
a political pretext for Saudi Arabian diplomacy. Riyadh's 
policy of causing civil war in Yemen follows the failure of 
repeated attempts by Saudi Arabian leaders to weaken united 
Yemen through transferring political, economic, and security 
crises into that country. 
  Parallel to Riyadh's efforts to perpetuate Yemen's domestic 
crisis by recognizing the Aden government in the south, Saudi 
Arabia also seeks to create and magnify a pseudo-crisis in the 
region, hoping thus to divert public opinion in the region's 
nations from their own policies of discord. 
  The plan, or to be more precise, the creation of a so-called 
issue of the three islands and efforts to create differences 
between Iran and the United Arab Emirates is also within this 
context. But this weapon is now increasingly losing its 
effectiveness with the gradual publication of legal and historic 
documents by official international sources regarding the 
sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran over the islands.

  [Text] Tehran, June 4, IRNA -- The Foreign Ministry here 
today reiterated that the three Lesser and Greater Tunbs as well 
as Abu Musa Islands belonged to Iran according to the historical 
documents, and welcomed talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE) 
without any precondition. 
  Mahmud Mohammadi, a Foreign Ministry's spokesman, referred 
to 
the final communique of the (Persian) Gulf Cooperation Council 
(PGCC) Sunday night [5 June], and said the communique did not 
reportedly pass unanimously, and that all six PGCC ministers 
were not present at the time of approval. 
  However, he stressed that according to the historical 
documents the islands have always belonged to Iran, and said 
Iran has always welcomed mutual talks with UAE without any 
precondition. "The invitation for Shaykh Hamdan is still 
valid," he added. 
  Prominent university scholars in a recent seminar in Paris 
reviewed the historial documents on Iran's ownership of the 
islands. 
  On the Saudi protest to the Iranian media reports concerning 
Saudi Arabia, which had been included in the PGCC final 
communique, Mohammadi said Iranian media "are totally free". 
  "The media in Iran criticize also formal policies of the 
country most of the time, and our neighbours should understand 
this reality," he said adding "on the other hand it is natural 
that the media would react when they see the negligence of an 
agreement." 
  Mohammadi also refuted the claims of Iran's support and 
military aid to one of the warring sides in Yemen, and said Iran 
had expressed its regret over the clashes and opposed any 
military operations in Yemen. The Islamic Republic adopted an 
impartial position and announced its readiness for mediation in 
Yemen, he said. 
  More on the issue the spokesman said Iran is deeply 
interested in the integrity of the Islamic countries, whose 
disintegration, he said, are provoked by the foreigners. "We 
support the settlement of disputes in a peaceful way." 
  "We are deeply sorry for the killing of each and every 
Muslim 
whether in the north or in the south, and we invite the two 
sides to end the clashes and begin talks with the aim of 
preservation of Yemen's unity," he said. 
  Mohammadi also invited other countries to show self-restrain 
and avoid flaming the tension.

  [Text] Yesterday afternoon the Thai ambassador in Tehran 
was summoned to the Foreign ministry and handed a note of 
protest by the deputy foreign minister and head of the 
Department for Southern and Eastern Affairs. The Central News 
Unit reports this note protested the arrest of several Iranians 
on the trumped-up charges of their attempting to blow up the 
Zionist regime's embassy in Bangkok and also to related 
interviews by Thai officials. 
  In this note of protest, the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
demanded an immediate response from the Thai Government and has 
asked for documented proof of the charges brought against the 
Iranian nationals. It has also asked the Thai Government to 
arrange a meeting between officials of the Islamic Republic's 
consulate in Bangkok and the accused.

<F P=106> [Commentary from the 209th issue of KORDESTAN magazine; date </F>
not given: "Let Us Not Forget the Political Prisoners" ] 
  [Text] The inhuman crimes and acts that the Islamic 
Republic has been perpetrating against the people of our 
country, and especially against its political opponents during 
its more than 15 years of rule, have made the world realize its 
nature as a state completely against freedom. This is why not a 
year passes without the Islamic Republic being listed among the 
world's bloodthirsty and arbitrary regimes and without its being 
criticized on a world level. 
  Some of the most heart-rending crimes by this regime are 
perpetrated against combatants who disagree with the clergymen 
and are opponents of the regime. During the 15 years of the 
regime's existence, hundreds of Iranian citizens have been 
thrown into the torture chambers of the Islamic Republic because 
of their political beliefs and have received long prison terms, 
while thousands have received the death penalty. 
  Here we do not intend to refer to all these crimes and to 
the 
inhuman acts that have become ordinary in the dungeons of the 
Islamic Republic. These crimes have been revealed on many 
occasions. Revelations have been made of heart-rending acts 
such as the mass murder of political prisoners, extortion, 
depriving them of the right to a lawyer, summary trials, rape of 
girls before their execution, dozens of kinds of psychological 
and physical tortures, and leaving the world uninformed of the 
situation of the political prisoners and so on by presenting no 
documentary proof. Actually very few are unaware that all types 
of crimes have been perpetrated in clerical Iran against 
political prisoners. Thus, in this article we intend to only 
list the duties that the families and relatives of the political 
prisoners, our country's masses, opposition parties and 
organizations, and world humanitarian groups and organizations 
have toward these political prisoners. 
  If we accept the fact that the struggle against dictatorship 
and strangulation is a holy mission--and we do--and if we 
believe in the fact that the Islamic Republic is the 
full-fledged enemy of human rights and freedoms and the 
strangler of these rights and freedoms--and we do--both we, 
those who live in Iran and face the bullying and arbitrariness 
of the clerical regime, and the humanitarian circles and 
organizations and, in general, progressive humanity, the human 
values and criteria of which the Islamic Republic is ridiculing, 
we will have certain duties to perform as far as the political 
prisoners in Iran are concerned. 
  We would first like to list the duties of the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. We know that for some 
time now the clerical regime has wanted to pretend that there is 
no such thing as a political prisoner in Iran and that the 
combatants who are under arrest have been cast into prison on 
charges of ordinary crimes. For this reason, the relatives and 
families of the political prisoners should use every possible 
means to contact opposition organizations and to give them any 
information that they have on their dear imprisoned ones such as 
their name, age, educational background, profession, political 
activities and stands, the date and place of their arrest, and 
whatever they know about their trial. They should try to hand 
over the necessary information and documents on their imprisoned 
relative to representatives of the Human Rights Commission and 
Amnesty International when they visit Iran. If possible, they 
should make their voices heard by the foreign mass media and by 
those humanitarian organizations and groups that are ready to 
reveal the crimes perpetrated by the Iranian rulers. 
  Many of these duties do not concern only the families and 
relatives of the political prisoners. Each and every 
respectable and sensitive person should consider himself a 
next-of-kin of the political prisoners and to consider it his 
duty to inform the people and political forces of Iran, as well 
as the world, of the situation the imprisoned freedom-lovers are 
in. The duty that our country's masses have in relation with 
this is even heavier. While revealing these crimes and giving 
the necessary information to the competent circles, they should 
also be active in another field. They should become a backbone 
and a mouthpiece for those families who are facing numerous 
psychological and material problems because their daughter, son, 
or the head of the family has been arrested. The more the masses 
sympathize with the families of the political prisoners and 
strive to remove their problems, the more they will be resisting 
the executioners and the prouder they will defend their demands 
which are the demands of the majority of the people in our 
country as well. 
  A political prisoner should feel that if he has welcomed 
torture and death for the sake of fulfilling the demands and the 
freedoms of the people of the country, the people too are 
appreciative, and they are not indifferent toward their families 
and their sacrifices. More important yet, our compatriots should 
organize protest movements related to the political prisoners 
and demand that the regime end their behind-the-scene trials, 
publish the number of political prisoners and a report on the 
true situation of the prisoners, allow political prisoners to 
meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis, 
provide suitable health and food facilities, and allow them 
access to radios and newspapers, and the books that they wish to 
read. All the staged acts that the Islamic Republic of Iran is 
carrying out in connection with the political prisoners should 
be neutralized, and especially when representatives of 
organizations defending human rights come to Iran to assess the 
situation of human rights, our compatriots should try to 
organize antiregime protests and to inform these representatives 
of the dire situation that the political prisoners in Iran are 
facing. 
  Iran's political forces that are engaged in a struggle 
against the regime should inform world public opinion of all the 
documents and information that they acquire through their 
members and supporters and through the people of our country in 
connection with the political prisoners. Many of these forces 
have some sort of propaganda means such as radio stations, 
newspapers, and so on. Therefore, while publishing such 
information and documentation, they should pay more attention to 
directing and encouraging the masses of our country and to 
further informing them of the duties that they have toward the 
political prisoners. 
  During the past few years, all the antiregime forces have 
strived to inform the world abroad of the situation of the 
political prisoners in Iran. Undoubtedly, if there is more 
cooperation and coordination among the opposition organizations 
and personalities and if a common plan is laid out, their 
efforts and the activities in this field will be more widely 
reflected and there will be more solidarity than is seen on the 
global level today. 
  Until now, Amnesty International, the Middle East Watch, the 
Human Rights Commission, the UN General Assembly, and many other 
world pro-human rights groups and organizations have revealed 
the unprecedented crimes that the Islamic Republic of Iran has 
perpetrated and is perpetrating against the political prisoners. 
But the repeated condemnation of the Islamic Republic by these 
organizations and groups has not put an end to the massacre of 
political prisoners in Iran or, at least, helped to bring about 
a major development in relation to them. One of the reasons for 
this is that the governments of the world have not attached 
great importance to the views and stands of pro-human rights 
organizations on the Islamic Republic and, ignoring the 
antipopular nature of this regime, they have continued their 
political-economic relations and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic. 
  It is by taking these facts into consideration that 
pro-human 
rights organizations and all sources, forces, and personalities 
who consider their struggle against the massacre of 
freedom-seekers in Iran to be their humanitarian duty should 
mobilize world public opinion and place governments under 
pressure to stop transactions and cooperation with the Islamic 
Republic, and to isolate this regime in the world on charges of 
fighting against freedom and crushing freedom-lovers. 
  We hope that everyone will help to serve the political 
prisoners of Iran.

<F P=106> ["Weekly Political Newsletter" by Dr. Mohammad Javad </F>
Larijani, Tehran Majles deputy and member of the Supreme 
National Security Council: "Occupied Palestine and the Middle 
East Situation"] 
  [Text] 1. It is possible that the situation in occupied 
Palestine may appear rather erratic: On the one hand, the 
people in Gaza and Jericho celebrated the departure of the 
Zionist soldiers and on the other hand one of the most intense 
armed clashes took place between the Palestinian combatants and 
the Israelis in al-Khalil [Hebron]. 
  Is there a dichotomy among the Palestinians? Does this mean 
that there is one group that is in favor of jihad against the 
Zionist regime and another that is seeking a normal life--even 
though vicarious--on the sidelines of this regime? We should 
view the issue in a more comprehensive manner. What will the 
changes in the Palestinian movement be, the political role of 
the Middle East and even of the regions beyond it in light of 
current political moves in the region in which the United 
States, Israel and the West have used all their weight? 
  2. The motives behind the moves of the United States and 
Israel with regard to the Palestinian movement and the intifadah 
are quite clear. They obviously want them to be snuffed out as 
soon as possible. Military pressure has not yielded any results 
and efforts to sow political discord have also not been able to 
drive a wedge in the ranks. The only hope that is left for them 
is that the intifadah should be contained within narrow 
geographical confines and should be pitted against 'Arafat's 
forces. 'Arafat should be given serious support (military, 
political, financial, and propagandistic) and what the Zionist 
regime was unable to achieve, should be done by 'Arafat. What 
should the Islamic movement do in such circumstances? 
  In my opinion, the current dual policy is the best one! In 
Gaza and Jericho, the Islamic movement should not become 
embroiled with pro-'Arafat forces who until yesterday were among 
the ranks of the intifadah. They should be strongly inducted 
into the management! Outside the confines of the autonomous 
region, the intifadah should continue with all its strength. 
There is no doubt that 'Arafat and Israel are apprehensive of 
any kind of victory of the Islamic forces in all kinds of 
elections and their effective participation in the management. 
Some reports indicate that Israel prefers that 'Arafat 
personally be in charge of administrative affairs for some time, 
and that there be no elections. 
  In either case, the path will be opened for the victory of 
the Muslims, that is, if there are elections and they win or if 
there is a dictatorship and 'Arafat's supporters stand behind 
him. 'Arafat will be forced to ask the Israelis for assistance 
once again for his own perpetuation and the extent of the 
intifadah will continue in its own sphere of action! 
  3. Worry with regard to the assessments that I have 
mentioned above have motivated the United States and Israel to 
pay attention to the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran as 
regards the course of the intifadah and they are exceedingly 
afraid of the spiritual and political effect of our stances. 
The strong stance of the U.S. secretary of state during his 
address to a gathering of Jews in New York is a clear indication 
of this fear. 
  Thus, the fabrication of a new preoccupation with regard to 
Iran has been placed on the agenda. Perhaps the most 
appropriate pretext and in fact, one on which they would have 
greater control would be some Arab countries in the Persian 
Gulf. An important point that merits the attention of the 
officials of Islamic Iran and the regional governments is: Our 
friends in the littoral states of the southern Persian Gulf 
should know that the United States does not have the ability to 
bring about a change of regime in Baghdad! The United States 
has extracted an exorbitant price for this promise so far. 
Therefore, it is seeking to clear its ledger, in practice, by 
its propaganda of a stronger threat, such as Iran. Right from 
the outset, it was clear that the United States did not have the 
ability to fulfill its promise, as Iraq is not a Panama or a 
Grenada! Even if it were, it would not have been to the benefit 
of the region that the door be opened to such intervention by 
the United States. This means that the sole path that remains 
for maintaining stability and peace in the Persian Gulf region 
is collective cooperation among the regional countries and that 
is all! 
  4. The Washington echelons have recently broken a world 
record in tactlessness: Their policy from the PRC, Japan, all 
the way to the Middle East and Iran is characterized by an 
egocentricity and stupidity which is the best way to describe 
their stances and behavior. 
  In such circumstances, our foreign policy should be based 
entirely on the main axes of our national interests with extreme 
poise and we should refrain from getting involved in 
controversial and marginal issues, regardless of whether these 
controversial issues pertain to any links with the IRA or are 
provocations in the form of awarding literary prizes to Salman 
Rushdie. 
  We have a momentous task ahead of us: To support the great 
Islamic renaissance [preceding word in French] and to prove that 
in today's world, we can transform our Islamic country into a 
modern and advanced country. Every step that we take forward 
toward the attainment of this objective is the biggest slap in 
the face of the enemies of dear Iran, proud Islam, and the great 
movement that our nation has brought about in the Islamic world.

  [Text] Athens, June 4, IRNA -- The 12-member European Union 
(EU) and the Islamic Republic of Iran have decided to continue 
their dialogue to promote and widen relations following talks 
between EU and Iranian officials in Athens Friday. 
  "We have decided to continue our discussion and exchange of 
views on various issues of mutual interest," 'Ali Ahani, 
director general for West European affairs at Iran's foreign 
ministry, told IRNA in an interview Saturday. 
  It was the third round of meeting between Iran and the EU. 
The first two rounds were held in Copenhagen and Brussels. 
  The Iranain delegation, led by deputy foreign minister for 
Euro-American affairs Mahmoud Va'ezi and the EU troika, headed 
by Greek Foreign Under Secretary George Papandreou, held 
marathon 3-hour talks yesterday. 
  The EU troika consists of the former, the current and the 
forthcoming holder of the rotating EU presidency, namely 
Belgium, Greece and Germany. 
  "We have very good relations with all the EU countries, in 
economic, political and cultural fields. But we should try to 
have the same level of cooperation with the EU in its totality," 
said Ahani. 
  Asked to comment on the recent expulsion of an Iranain 
diplomat from London and a British diplomat from Tehran, Ahani 
said he hoped the matter has now closed and there would be no 
further expulsions. 
  "I hope it will be stopped. We don't want to have tension in 
relations with any EU member," he said. The tensions were 
created by the British side, Ahani added. 
  The Iranian delegation left Athens Saturday after a 2-day 
visit during which they met Greek government officials and 
discussed bilateral political, economic and cultural ties. 
  Va'ezi was received by Greek Prime Minister Andreas 
Papandreau, the current euprht welcomed the expansion of 
Athens-Tehran ties and also Iran's relations with the EU. 
  Ahani said Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias will be 
visiting Tehran next week to continue discussions on bilateral 
relations and on regional and international issues. 
  Pointing that Greece currently holds the EU Presidency, 
Ahani 
said the Greek Minister's visit will offer an important 
opportunity to discuss the situation in the Persian Gulf region, 
the Balkans And europe. 
  Ahani described Greek-Iranian relations as "excellent."

  [Text] Larnaca, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] IRNA -- Last 
Wednesday the Cyprus Government expelled 30 Iranians, several of 
whom had just arrived at Larnaca Airport the same day. 
  One of the expelled Iranians, Reza Payami, said: The reason 
for expelling this group still has not been announced by the 
Cyprus police. 
  He said their expulsion was likely related to a theft that 
took place two weeks ago at a household appliances store. 
  Another of the individuals expelled said without giving his 
name: I was arrested by the Larnaca police as soon as I reached 
the airport. 
  He also claimed that the airport police tried in various 
ways 
to take the $1,800 he had away from him. 
  He said that he was forced to sell some of his household 
furnishings to make his trip to Cyprus possible. 
  A number of these expelled Iranians, citing deception or 
extortion of Iranians seeking work in Cyprus, asked Iran's 
embassies to cooperate with Iranians seeking work in various 
countries.

  [Text] Tehran, 10 Ordibehesht [30 April] KEYHAN-E HAVA'I 
News Service -- Following the dissolution of the apartheid 
regime and the participation of all races in the national 
elections in South Africa, Iran's political and economic 
relations with this country, which were cut off in 1980 after 
the triumph of the Islamic revolution of Iran, were resumed. 
  The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to 
supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for 
the announcement of the results of the South African elections, 
in order on that basis to organize relations with the next 
government in Pretoria. 
  Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349 
[21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at 
that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in 
Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations 
between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90 
percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran. 
Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National 
Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in 
South Africa. In addition to its participation in the 
construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned 
17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's 
shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30 
percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil 
and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent. 
  In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels 
per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus 
Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5 
percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery. 
  Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran 
National 
Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was 
required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf. 
Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million 
tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the 
time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons 
of crude oil had been delivered to this country. 
  In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign 
affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South 
Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed 
based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its 
oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic 
revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such 
that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares 
to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and 
prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African 
elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian 
Government can resume its relations with this country. 
  These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian 
regime's 
oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa 
made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner 
after Israel. 
  The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa 
cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium. 
Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the 
two countries were active importing and exporting and selling 
Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Here Comes Tagging"] </F>
  [Text] The costly war with Iraq is primarily responsible 
for our chronic economic difficulties. No right-thinking 
Iranian had expected life to be comfortable after the guns fell 
silent in 1988. The common masses, who are the supporters of the 
Islamic Revolution and sacrificed their near and dear ones in 
the 8-year-old war, knew that the post-war era would be 
problematic. 
  As is the case in such circumstances, the poor and middle 
class are always called on to make concessions. They have been 
ready to do their share every time and in many instances, much 
more than would be normally expected of them. 
  Speaking strictly of the economic health of the majority of 
our people, almost six years after Iraq's military aggressions 
ended we can at best say the situation has been deteriorating. 
To say the least the government of President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani seems to have entirely put the fate of the 
economy in the hands of `market forces'. Our economic planners 
have generally been unsuccessful and this bitter reality is 
clearly visible in the market itself. 
  Prices of goods and services have jumped to between 50 to 
250 
percent in the past few months. Chaos rules supreme in the 
bazaars to the extent that the business community refuses to 
acknowledge even the basic principles of trade not to mention 
the frontiers of human relations, ethics and respect for the 
rule of law. One lady shopper says of the retailers and 
shop-owners "they have full freedom to raise prices". In an 
area of a few hundred meters, prices differ as much as 20 to 30 
percent `depending on the conscience and justice' of the seller. 
  For years, we have heard our statesmen talk about the need 
to 
build a society on the foundation of social justice and economic 
morals. There is no death of seminars, conferences and 
gatherings where economic and social planners stick to the 
rhetoric of directing and sustaining our Muslim society, free 
from discrimination and injustice. But, whether we like it or 
not, the fundamental truth is that rhetoric has far outstripped 
reality. People with fixed incomes are doomed as their 
purchasing power declines every day and along with it their 
morale and tolerance. 
  This week the minister of commerce announced that it is 
compulsory to put price tags on commodities. It's a too little 
and too late a move. As far as our information goes, this 
measures also does not carry enough weight and was reportedly 
not coordinated with other related institutions and ministries. 
The tagging is no relief at all. Experience teaches us that 
this move is yet another gimmick to `stabilize the market', will 
have the same fate as hundreds of its predecessors. 
  Looking at the way ministries have functioned in the recent 
past, observers feel the government is equally to be blamed for 
the frightening confusion, as the middlemen and opportunists. 
They believe the government has exacerbated the already high 
inflation rate and slow economic growth--all of which have 
worsened the country's socio-economic problems and eroded the 
financial stability of the middle class. 
  Then there is the dollar disease. Everything from pin to 
plane is calculated on the `$ price'. Education, housing and 
medical services are gradually getting out of reach for the 
ordinary working class, as our policymakers are increasingly 
forgetting that these three basics are rights and not privileges. 
  We are always given sermons about falling revenues due to 
the 
drop in oil prices. Of course the oil argument cannot be 
regarded as total nonsense. No doubt that too is a factor, but 
let's not forget that all developing countries do not survive on 
oil. They select and elect the right people for key positions. 
Honesty, efficiency and merit are the criteria of appointments 
in majority of the states if not all. Thank God, most of our 
officials are certainly honest and God-fearing persons and some 
are competent too. In view of the current socio-economic 
problems in the country effective action should be taken to find 
similar people for the middle and lower ranking government 
positions also. 
  Nevertheless the people would like to see what the Commerce 
Ministry's tagging will bring in its wake. It has become 
apparent that the government's influence in maintaining economic 
order is slight to almost non-existent.

  [Text] Concurrent with the unprecedented intensification of 
the economic and social crisis in the country and increasing 
mass protests by an exasperated public, reports have been 
received of the spread of student strikes. 
  Following the student strike at Martyr Beheshti University 
in 
Tehran (formerly the National University), which began as a 
strike by women students against the unworkable situation at the 
student dormitories and quickly spread throughout the 
university, the strike continued for a week with a demand for 
the firing of the university management. 
  Based on this report, whose details are still unclear, 500 
accounting students at Tehran's 'Alameh Tabataba'i University 
staged a strike on 7 and 8 Esfand last year [26-27 February 
1994] demanding the firing of the university president. 
Likewise, officials at Qom's Fatemieh University closed the 
academic term in the face of an extensive student strike against 
this university's excessive tuition increase. 
  The leaders of the regime of the "vice regency of the chief 
jurisconsult," who remember well the experience of the student 
strikes of the years 1355-56 [21 March 1976-20 March 1978] and 
their connection with a mass movement during the Bahman [21 
January-19 February] revolution, have undertaken a terrified 
search for a solution, believing that by "dealing" with some of 
the class demands of the students they will prevent the student 
movement from spreading and becoming a national political 
movement. In this regard, in a note in the budget passed for 
1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995], the Majles has required the 
Central Bank to "provide the relevant universities with 10 
billion tumans through the banking system in the form of 
interest-free or participatory loans and other devices to 
complete and build student dormitories."

<F P=106> [Article by Ovidio Bellando] </F>
  [Text] [President Carlos] Menem will meet with [U.S. 
President Bill] Clinton before the end of the month if the steps 
being taken by Raul Granillo Ocampo [Argentine ambassador to the 
United States] in Washington are successful in making the 
agendas of the two heads of state compatible. 
  The Argentine president is to attend the Ibero-American 
Summit in Cartagena, Colombia, on 14-15 June, and will then make 
a state visit to Canada from 20 to 22 June. The meeting being 
considered by the U.S. Department of State and the White House 
could therefore be held between these dates or on the way back 
from Ottawa. 
  The idea of a meeting between the two presidents originated 
at the top levels of government. Yet when some weeks ago the 
president made it clear that he would not make a stopover in the 
United States on his trip from Cartagena to Canada -- that he 
would return to Buenos Aires due to affairs of state, and then 
leave from there for Canada -- some circles in Washington 
expressed their interest in Menem's reviewing his decision. In 
other words, they considered such a meeting to be quite possible. 
  However, where could the meeting be held? 
  As all the bureaucratic formalities have not yet been gone 
through, it is still not possible to talk about an event that is 
certain, but rather about the possibilities, which are the 
following: 
  -- If the U.S. President were to decide to attend the 
inauguration of the World Cup of soccer or to go to some of the 
matches, he could meet up with his Argentine counterpart. 
  -- If Clinton decided to spend some days resting in 
California, he could play golf with Menem. 
  -- If Clinton's activities at the White House allowed him to 
be free for luncheon, Menem would lunch with him. 
  Career diplomats, who are always willing to undertake 
difficult tasks (like this one, on account of the dates), 
believe that the meeting is likely to take place, and will even 
be a promising one. 
  The analysis they make is that Argentina has become a 
reliable country and an excellent channel for conveying to big 
brother [preceding two words in English] the region's concerns. 
  In the view of the sources consulted, the Summit of the 
Americas to be held in Miami on 8-9 December is just round the 
corner, and its sponsor, the United States, has not proposed 
subjects that have drawn much interest. Hence, the contribution 
of a friend might help the host to offer a more attractive 
agenda. 
  Menem is very much aware of the importance of elections -- 
even those for electing Constituent Assembly members -- and 
knows that his friend -- according to the exchange of letters -- 
faces a difficult test in the upcoming November parliamentary 
elections. The lack of definition concerning Haiti, for example, 
may decrease the Democratic Party vote. 
  In other words, from a domestic standpoint, it would suit 
Menem admirably to have another meeting with Clinton. After 
all, it would be another proof that the United States takes 
Argentina into consideration. Moreover, it would not be 
immaterial for Clinton to listen to the opinion of a partner who 
knows how to translate into words the thinking and reluctances 
of his Latin American counterparts.

<F P=106> [By Victor M. Carrida] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 2 Jun (PL) -- If total failure was the 
result of the visit U.S. lawmaker Roberto Torricelli paid to 
Mexico, the important actions of solidarity with Cuba registered 
here increase the dimensions of the fiasco. 
  Known at the international level for being the author of the 
law bearing his name to strengthen the economic blockade imposed 
by Washington against Havana more than 30 years ago, Torricelli 
arrived in Mexico with very clear plans of supervising and 
meddling, according to the Mexican press. 
  A few days before arriving in this city, the congressman 
presented a draft law that calls for political reforms in Mexico 
and for international observers in the Mexican federal elections 
to be held in August. 
  Furthermore, he arrived with the purpose of getting directly 
involved in the armed conflict that has been taking place in the 
southern State of Chiapas since early this year and of holding a 
meeting with the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
which is leading the rebellion by the Chiapas Indians that began 
on New Year's Day. 
  However, in an open rejection of the visitor, the Zapatists 
burned the letter in which Torricelli requested a meeting. 
Torricelli was not received either by Amado Avendano, 
independent candidate for governor of Chiapas and director of 
the daily TIEMPO from San Cristobal de las Casas, a newspaper 
that plays an important role in the evolution of the conflict in 
Chiapas. Leaders from other political and social organizations 
of this state also refused to talk with the congressman. 
Torricelli left Chiapas one day ahead of schedule. 
  The situation in Mexico City was not encouraging either. 
Deputies, high-ranking government officials, and the press in 
general did not spare any criticism of the interventionist 
purposes of the legislator, and they went as far as proposing 
that he be declared persona non grata. 
  On Sunday, a group of activists from the Promoters of 
Solidarity with Cuba group demonstrated in front of the U.S. 
Embassy here to protest the lawmaker's visit, and they burned a 
coffin with a dummy that symbolized the visitor and his 
well-known anti-Cuban law. 
  Exactly one day before concluding his stay in Cuba, 
Torricelli witnessed the announcement of the official visit 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Havana 
in mid-June. According to the request made by the president for 
authorization from National Congress to leave the country, the 
visit to Cuba "will serve to promote even more bilateral 
relations, evaluate the contents of the agenda, and explore new 
actions that will diversify and strengthen it." 
  This idea was supported here last night by the Chamber of 
Deputies when it approved the president's request and pointed 
out that the visit will be "a show of Mexico's solidarity for 
the Cuban people and of the standards that guide Mexican foreign 
policy." Rodolfo Becerril, chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' 
foreign relations committee, emphasized that Salinas' visit to 
Havana "is taking place at a time when some U.S. Congressmen 
want to tighten the blockade against that country (Cuba) and on 
the eve of the (fourth) Ibero-American Summit." 
  The stand voiced by the deputies was emphasized when the 
Mexican legislators of the six parties of the chamber decided to 
donate one day's salary to the Cubans. This money will be used 
to purchase petroleum for the island. The legislators are from 
the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD), National Action Party (PAN), 
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PARM), Popular 
Socialist Party (PPS), and the Cardenist Front for National 
Reconstruction Party (PFCRN). 
  When referring to Torricelli's recent visit to Mexico, 
Foreign Under Secretary Andres Rozental said that the U.S. 
legislator's visit "was rejected in general, and this united all 
Mexicans." The high-ranking official pointed out that NAFTA, 
which was signed by Mexico, the United States, and Canada, does 
not give any country the right to intervene in the affairs of 
the other, and he insisted that commercial integration involves 
social and political aspects.

  [Text] Havana, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Cuban Border Guards 
Unit refrained from attacking a vessel on which 61 persons fled 
the island last weekend, a government source said today. 
  The guards, who had sighted minors aboard, limited 
themselves 
to escorting the vessel until it had left Cuban jurisdictional 
waters. 
  The U.S. Coast Guard rescued the vessel on Saturday in 
international waters off the Florida Keys; there were seven 
wounded aboard. The Cuban Foreign Ministry refused to comment 
on the incident.

  [Text] Lima, 5 Jun (EFE) -- An opinion poll that was 
released in Lima on 5 June shows that Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori and former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
would tie at presidential runoff elections if they were held 
right now. 
  The metropolitan daily EXPRESO published the results of the 
opinion poll conducted by Datum, a private company. The poll 
shows that in the event of runoff elections, and should Fujimori 
and Perez de Cuellar run for president, Fujimori would get 43.8 
percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar would get 42.8 
percent. Datum feels that "technically" these figures should be 
considered a "tie." 
  The opinion poll shows that during the first electoral round 
neither candidate would obtain 50 percent plus one vote. The 
current president would get 39.9 percent and the former UN 
secretary general would get 32.2 percent. 
  Peruvian presidential and legislative elections are 
scheduled 
for April 1995.

<F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara is planning to announce 
this week an amnesty that will benefit 578 former officials of 
the former regime, according to official sources. 
  The list includes 75 former members, 510 former 
corregimiento 
representatives, former President Eric Arturo Delvalle; Juan B. 
Sosa, former ambassador to the United States; and Vice 
President-elect Gabriel Altamirano Duque [figures as published]. 
  The case of the 510 representatives exists because they 
appointed General Manuel Antonio Noriega as chief of government. 
The dossiers against Delvalle and Sosa are related to the 
investigations the second circuit prosecutor is conducting on 
alleged irregularities in the handling of $10.8 million from the 
funds the United States froze on Panama. The case against Tomas 
Gabriel Altamirano Duque concerns charges made by Omayra Correa, 
Panama City mayor-elect. 
  Concurrently, the assembly is debating an amnesty for 
political crimes. Legislator Raul Ossa has said the individuals 
in line to receive these benefits should only be those accused 
of violations against state security; otherwise, this amnesty 
would leave a door open to benefit those being investigated for 
common crimes. 
  Meanwhile, Miguel Bush, legislator from the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party, has wanted to add an article to the draft 
amnesty so that it would exclude those charged with homicide and 
embezzlement. 
  A judiciary source has said the dossier against the former 
members of the General State Council includes: Manuel Solis 
Palma; Manuel Antonio Noriega; Francisco Rodriguez; Rodolfo 
Chiari De Leon; Jorge Ritter; Orville Goodin; Rene Bultron; Juan 
Bosco Bernal; Elmo Martinez Blanco; Darien Ayala; Cesar Martans; 
Jose Renan Esquivel; and Ricardo Bermudez. 
  It also includes Nander Pitty; Celso Carrizo; Carlos 
Villalaz; Olmedo Sanjur; Pascual Gonzalez; Virgilio Mirones; 
Rafael Arosemena; Azael Purcait; Jaime Simons; Francisco Sanchez 
Cardenas; Alejandro Vernaza; Aida de Gartner; Alberto Luis 
Tunon; Dario Fernandez; Dario Gonzalez; Carlos Orillac; Benjamin 
Colamarco; Tomas Noriega; Rafael Castrellon; and Gilberto Tunon. 
  Other former members of the General State Council are: Angel 
Jaen; Mario Luis Pitti; Luis Blanco; Cesar Montenegro; Bernardo 
Dominguez; Leovigildo Herrera; Euclides Tejada; Elvia de Ortiz; 
Dagoberto Lara; Ana Villa de Flores; Carlos Estrada; Veyra 
Remon; Victor Levy; Victoria de Robolt; Marcos Hughes; Jose 
Arauz; Jose Rodriguez; Marcos Mariscal; Alberto Arjona; Fermin 
Herrera; and Eufemia Laguna. 
  Also included in the dossiers are Julio Shaik; Jorge 
Bristan; 
Mateo Castillero; Arturo Diez; Augusto Valderrama; Aminta de 
Guillen; Nilson Espino; Hidalgo Fung; Abdiel Juliao; Eduardo 
Marin; Rafael Moreno; Paulino Romero; Jorge Tason; Aurea 
Torrijos; and Ligia Castro.

<F P=106> [Speech by Ayatollah 'Ali Hoseyni Khamene'i, leader of the </F>
Islamic revolution, to a gathering at the Imam Khomeyni 
Mausoleum in Tehran -- live] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Praise be to God, lord of the universe. God's 
prayers and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his scion and 
his companions. [passage omitted] 
  I express my condolences on the fifth anniversary of the 
demise of our great imam to all the truth-seeking Muslims of the 
world, especially to the dear and great Iranian nation. I 
sincerely express my regards to those who in the course of these 
five years have chosen the path of the imam as the luminous path 
of their lives and have exulted proudly in this fact, as well as 
those sincere and true disciples of that noble personage, who 
are numerous in our nation and in other nations. 
  Similarly, I consider it necessary to convey my sympathies 
to 
the respected and esteemed family of the late imam for the 
selfless service they rendered to that noble personality in the 
last years of his life. This was a heavy and major 
responsibility, which they took on themselves and carried out in 
the best possible manner, especially his illustrious and dear 
son Haj Seyyed Ahmad. 
  Today, I wish to mention a few points in memory of that 
noble 
personality as the basic points for future reference, study, and 
perception during this grand and tumultuous gathering. 
  First, I will begin with the personality of the imam, even 
though much has been said and written and sung about it by 
orators, authors, and singers. [passage omitted] 
  The imam's most noble action was to lay the foundation of an 
Islamic government and system. It would be worthwhile for our 
respected brothers and sisters to note the importance and 
greatness of this noble action of the imam so that it will be 
correctly etched in their minds. 
  Our revered imam established an Islamic system on which our 
Government is based. Then we have Islamic political 
institutions and a program which is also Islamic. All these 
three are worth pondering and mulling over. The Islamic system 
that the imam created and established in this country 
constitutes the format for the life of this nation in an Islamic 
mold with an Islamic meaning and bias. This Islamic system has 
faith as its main essence; faith in God, in the unknown. This 
system has a form, an image--the Islamic shari'ah. 
  Such a system has not existed in the course of history and 
does not exist elsewhere in the world today, except at the 
beginning [of Islam]. This system is based on the ingredient of 
faith, and an image, a corpus of the laws of the Islamic 
shari'ah. This system is exclusive, exceptional, and not well 
identified by the materialists, even though it is 
well-comprehended by Muslims who are familiar with the Koran and 
Islam. Of course, no one expected that such a system could be 
implemented in this day and age. It could not even be imagined 
that with so much hostility and opposition, any one could even 
dare to go in this direction or have the power to carry out this 
task. 
  However, the imam achieved the impossible through the 
strength of his faith, determination, and hard work, and with 
his reliance on the fervent and loving hearts of the millions. 
A prominent part of this system is the political apparatus, 
that is, the administration. This is the basic department in all 
systems, that is, the political element from which the system 
takes its form. It is on this basis that systems, ideologies, 
and objectives can be correctly identified. Our great imam 
forged a government unparalleled in the contemporary world, even 
in the course of history--except for some exceptional cases, 
right from the advent of Islam until today. [passage omitted] 
  The second characteristic of this political system is its 
independence, because it does not give in to extraneous 
pressure. Our system is not intimidated by any power and has 
ignored the decrees of the powerful ones of the world, who are 
equipped and armed with the weapons of wealth and might. This 
in itself is an unprecedented phenomenon in the world. However, 
in the system of the Islamic Republic of Iran, its nature is 
such that with the grace of our Creator, all the officials are 
endowed with these qualities. This noble figure [Khomeyni] was 
the most sublime example of these characteristics. The others 
are also blessed with these qualities. This is the kind of 
political apparatus of the Islamic system created by the imam. 
  The third point is the program. The program is also unique 
among the programs propounded by the reformers of the world, 
governments, and harbingers of new messages. Reconstruction of 
the world and of the hereafter goes hand in hand. The Islamic 
system wishes for people to flourish in this world but hopes 
they will not content themselves with that. The world and the 
hereafter are interrelated in the Islamic system and in the 
program of this system. Human beings should live in an 
honorable and comfortable manner, but comfort and welfare and 
all that ensures such comfort are mere preliminaries, subject to 
God's pleasure. They are only a precursor. This is an 
exceptional phenomenon on the plane of today's world and has 
been so throughout history, except for the governments of the 
prophets, their successors, and their implementors. 
  Everyone wishes to reform the material world for the people, 
but apparently they are not able to. However, the Islamic 
system reforms the world and the hereafter; it is capable of 
doing so. This is the strength which has been revealed by Islam. 
If the present situation of the country is viewed through the 
eyes of justice, this will be confirmed. Ours is a country on 
which a war was imposed for eight years. Its factories and 
roads were destroyed. An economic embargo was clamped on it. 
Its resources were wrested from it; and no assistance was 
extended by any government. 
  Internally, various kinds of pressure were exerted on the 
nation and government by political and propagandistic means. 
This country, this nation, this government is implementing the 
program to reconstruct the country, especially infrastructural 
projects, in a manner which has elicited the praise of 
observers. Those who come and perceive this process, commend 
the programs and their executors. 
  Without the pressure from the enemy, if the traitorous and 
trouble-making hands of the enemy had not existed, if the 
enemy's propagandistic and politico-economic presence had not 
lurked beyond our borders, the situation would have been far 
better and most of the economic problems that we have today 
would not exist. The Islamic system is concerned with the 
administration and prosperity of the world and the hereafter. 
No other program is concerned with the religion of the nation, 
the hereafter of human beings. The Islamic system imparts 
training and civilization. 
  Today in our country, a general movement can be observed, 
especially among our youths, toward learning the Koran, studying 
religion, abiding by Islamic tenets and injunctions. This is a 
distinguishing feature of the programs formulated by brains and 
hearts that have been guided by the Koran and Islam. These are 
not confined to the materialistic world. The materialists claim 
that they are ameliorating the world for the people, but they 
cannot do so. However, Islam focuses on the world and the 
hereafter; and by the grace of God, it is able to do so as well. 
Our people--as a result of Islam--have been endowed with 
exceptional faith, fortitude, and awareness, which is unique 
among the nations of the world. This range of characteristics 
together is the product of the work of this noble personage, the 
true servant of the Almighty. [crowd chants God is Great! 
Khomeyni is the Leader!] 
  I should make three points: There is a trend toward 
political centralization in the world and the wielder of world 
power is demanding that nations and governments should be 
reduced to captivity and follow the dictates of the central 
power, which today is the United States, its satellites and 
cohorts. Many have failed and fallen in the path of this trend. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran, however, has stood steadfast. 
  Blessed by this steadfastness, the Islamic Republic of Iran 
declares its categorical stance on the Palestinian issue while 
others do not have the courage even to listen to it at times. 
This categorical declaration, on which the Iranian nation and 
Government are unanimous, is that Palestine is a country that 
belongs to the Palestinian people. The Zionist government is a 
despotic government; the principles of this government and 
system are absolutely illegitimate. [crowd chants] 
  Many do not even have the courage to listen to those who 
utter such remarks. Thus, the talks that are being held on 
Palestine are nothing but empty words. They do not have any 
worth or credibility, because they are in contradiction of the 
truth and the accepted norms. Contrary to this, the views of 
the Government and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran on all 
international issues are independent and truthful. 
  As for the Muslims in the Balkans, we believe that the 
pressure on the Balkan Muslims is to insure that a Muslim nation 
and a Muslim government do not take shape in Europe. The fear 
is of Islam. Thus, it was on the basis of a calculated plan that 
the domineering powers in the world today have not supported the 
Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. They know what they are doing. 
They have supported and assisted the Serbs in a calculated 
manner. They prevented arms and military equipment from 
reaching the Muslims in a calculated manner. This is the view 
of our Government and nation; it constitutes a condemnation of 
the present domineering powers with regard to the issues of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Balkans. 
  With regard to the newly independent Muslims of Central 
Asia, 
the Kashmiri Muslims, the Azerbaijani Muslims, the Muslims in 
every part of Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, the opinion of 
our Government and nation is that it is the right of these 
Muslims to live in an Islamic manner and to implement the 
injunctions of the Islamic shari'ah in their daily lives. No 
one has the right to prevent them from doing so. Western powers 
that describe this as fundamentalism prevent some of these 
countries from even holding free elections. We believe that this 
interference and encroachment with regard to the affairs of 
Muslim nations is tyrannical and unwarranted. They have the 
right to have an Islamic way of life and should be given an 
opportunity to do so. 
  On the issue of Lebanon, the Iranian nation and government 
condemn the Zionist aggression; we deem the struggle against the 
Zionists imperative and accords with them as invalid. These are 
the independent stances of the Islamic system and the Islamic 
government and these are the reasons why the pyramid of 
international power levels accusations against the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. This is where the accusations stem 
from. 
  The second point is that these so-called accusations 
probably 
stem from a distortion of realities. In many cases, they refer 
to what is actually a point of strength in the system of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. For example, they accuse the Islamic 
Republic of Iran of fundamentalism. By this term they mean 
prejudice and Stone Age beliefs. This means, in fact, the 
refusal on the part of the Iranian people and government to 
surrender to the unjust desires of the international powers, so 
we are labeled as primeval. No. This is the rightful stance of 
a Muslim nation; it is not a primeval belief. If fundamentalism 
is the term used for respect for accepted principles, it is 
commendable and all should be proud of it. It is a lie to term 
it primeval and prejudicial, and it is a false accusation 
against the Iranian Government and nation. 
  Then they slander the Islamic Republic of Iran by saying 
that 
it does not adhere to human rights. They mean the 
implementation of Islamic penal laws [hodud]. We implement the 
Islamic ordinances. The Koran says: "Those are limits set by 
God: and anyone who transgresses the limits of God does verily 
wrong his (own) soul." Anyone who violates God's laws is 
subjected to the Almighty's chastisement. These are divine 
laws. We consider the understanding of the Koran and its text 
to have priority over the products of the impaired minds of the 
Western legislators who have laid out knowledge and inventions 
for themselves and give them precedence over the gnosis of 
Divine religions. We believe that the divine laws are to be 
given preference. 
  The path to the reform of a society is through the 
implementation of divine ordinances. It is possible that we may 
have shortcomings in this regard, but we are definitely moving 
in the direction of the complete implementation of the divine 
penal laws, of Koranic laws. This was the second point. 
  The last point is that our path is that of perseverance, 
following the attainment of the objectives of the Islamic system 
as this great person [Khomeyni] has delineated for us in the 
lessons by our great imam and as embodied in his will. This is 
the path of this nation. My dear brothers and sisters all over 
the country should heed the fact that the path to the happiness 
of the Iranian nation is to have recourse to Islamic and divine 
injunctions. 
  The path to the happiness of the Iranian nation is through 
reliance on the nation itself, its capabilities, and aptitudes. 
The road to the prosperity of this nation lies in severing all 
hopes from the domineering powers of the world and in not 
fearing these powers. Do not be afraid of them in the slightest 
and do not expect anything at all from them, even anything as 
tiny as the point of a needle. 
  My dear ones, the greatest gift given by the Islamic 
Revolution to this nation is that it has removed the evil of the 
corrupt and servile governments who for many years had imposed 
themselves on this country, this nation and these bounties of 
God. Today, with the blessings of the Almighty, the 
administrators of this country are the people themselves. 
Today, with the vigilance and endeavors of these people, the 
best form of popular government in accordance with the will of 
the people exists in this country. 
  Of course, the enemy denies this in his propaganda and this 
is how it should be. What else can we expect from the enemy! 
Here, the people elect an individual in accordance with their 
beliefs, their own criteria, Islamic criteria, for administering 
the country's executive matters, for legislation and guidance of 
the executive officials, with the ultimate freedom, reliance on 
faith and this is what is exceptional. If, in the well-known 
democratic countries in today's world, differences between 
factions, disputes among parties, and political tussles are the 
motivation behind elections, in this Islamic country, in the 
proud and honorable country of Iran, voting is carried out 
solely for the sake of faith and the recognition of divine 
values. This is what is worthwhile and important and this is 
what there is today. 
  In the whole world, I do not know of any place where there 
is 
a bond of affection, a rapport from the heart between the nation 
and the officials as is the case in Iran. The nation loves the 
officials and the officials love the nation with all their being 
and consider themselves to be at their service. This nation has 
such sentiments regardless of what the enemy's propaganda says. 
[passage omitted] 
  As the last sentence of my remarks, I wish to say that the 
Iranian nation and the officials should preserve these traits 
with all their power and being. [chants of God is great! other 
indiscernible chants]. The government and the people should 
safeguard the path of God, the path of Islam. The officials 
should not forget the people even for a second. In the great 
movement toward our reconstruction program, the underprivileged 
should be given intensive attention. The Islamic Majles should 
pass the laws, the government will implement them and the 
Judiciary will oversee the implementation of these laws with all 
its being. The nation will tread this path with all its 
strength and valor. This is the path of Islam, the Koran, of 
the religion of God, and the path that the great imam blazed for 
us. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the Foreign Policy Desk: "The United States, Saudi </F>
Arabia, and the Policy of Fomenting Tension in the Region"] 
  [Text] Every once in a while, U.S. officials address issues 
concerning the important Persian Gulf region and express the 
stances of their government on the political and security 
aspects of the issues. Even though these utterances may be 
projected as logical and popular, a deeper and precise 
examination will assist us to perceiving the ill-intentioned 
U.S. objectives. 
  In this regard, the presidential adviser for national 
security affairs, Anthony Lake, spoke recently on the Persian 
Gulf region and explained his country's stance. In his remarks, 
in order to capitalize further on the resources of the Arabs of 
the region, he once more waxed eloquent on the defeated policy 
of dual containment of Iraq and Iran and stressed the dangers 
from both these countries to the regional countries. 
  Even though one should admit that Washington's plan for dual 
containment of Iran and Iraq stems from a lack of understanding 
of the realities and how the needs of the region relate to U.S. 
foreign policy, by making such claims the United States is 
paving the way for a greater presence in the region. 
  In his remarks, Anthony Lake spoke in general terms of 
"extremism." Dividing it into religious and national extremism, 
he claimed that both were dangerous for the United States and 
the region. Extremism is one of those expressions frequently 
used by Americans, but they have never clearly defined what they 
actually mean by this term. 
  Even though extremism is even denounced in the religion of 
Islam, the U.S. hierarchy and, naturally, the regional Gulf 
officials have a different concept of extremism as compared with 
the usual concept. 
  From Washington's point of view, the term "extremism" 
applies 
to any individual or government not willing to officially 
recognize the illegitimate U.S. interests in various countries 
around the world. The Americans freely label anyone who does not 
succumb to their domination as an extremist, even though they 
have not yet presented any specific definition of this term. 
  For example, they refer to the Lebanese Hizballah as a 
conspicuous example of extremism. Have the Hizballah carried 
out any action other than armed resistance--which is the last 
resort of resistance--in the face of usurpation? Unfortunately, 
in today's world all kinds of freedom-seekers are suppressed by 
false accusations and even by force at sword point; and the 
subsequent struggle is labeled extremism. 
  Lake also rejected the notion of a war between the West and 
Islam after the collapse of the Eastern bloc and communism. 
While his own country is engaged in a multifaceted war against 
Islam in various parts of the world, Lake claims that the United 
States is strongly opposed to the view that the United States 
should go to war against Islam in the aftermath of the failure 
of communism. 
  Lake claimed that his country has no intentions of 
dominating 
the Middle East. Addressing these countries, he said that 
progress in the peace process will give the Middle Eastern 
countries an opportunity to embark on improving their economy 
and the lives of their people instead of squandering their 
resources purchasing weapons. 
  The realities in the region however belie his allegations. 
The establishment of military, air, and naval bases in Bahrain, 
Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Oman are outstanding examples 
of this fact. The White House adviser on national security 
affairs made these claims at a time when the region has been 
stockpiling destructive and complex American weapons, whose use 
is unclear even to the Arab shaykhs. 
  In the opinion of experts, the United States--by supporting 
the Zionist regime's existence and by generating tension between 
that regime and the Arab governments--intends to open up a new 
front of hostility and tension among the regional Muslim nations. 
  The prolonged visit by the U.S. assistant secretary of state 
to the Persian Gulf region, his provocative remarks regarding 
the so-called dangers from Iran, his resurrecting of the claims 
of the Untied Arab Emirates, all were part of the U.S. policy of 
generating tension in the region. 
  Some countries' endorsement of such claims against Iran is 
part of the overt U.S. policy of fomenting tension in the 
region. Unfortunately, some of these countries have fallen into 
the traps laid by the colonialists, and they are following 
precisely the same lines that the Americans have formulated to 
raise tension. 
  In this regard, in his speech yesterday, Saudi Arabian King 
Fahd called on Iran to abide by international norms and alluded 
to the UAE's territorial claims against Iran, calling for the 
handing over of the Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf to the 
UAE. 
  These remarks can only result in raising tension in the 
region, and will result in greater backwardness and misfortune 
for the region, with more domination and profit making by the 
United States. The Saudi king has thus taken a new step toward 
disrupting the sensitive situation in the Persian Gulf region.

  [Text] Tehran, June 7, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday expressed optimism over further 
improvement in the international oil market in the current 
calendar year. The president was speaking at a press conference 
this morning with the participation of over 100 local and 
foreign reporters and cameramen. 
  "It seems that situation in the oil market would further 
improve this year," the president replied to a question. 
  On the impact of the recent visit to Iran of a group of 
American editors on Tehran-Washington relations, the president 
said: "Such a visit could have no impact on the relations but 
could shed further light on some of the realities for the 
American people." 
  As for Iran's view over the policy the British Government 
has 
adopted in former Yugoslavia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani told the 
reporters that there were evidences proving that Britain did not 
cooperate well to repel the Serbs aggressions. 
  Commenting on [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader] 
Zhirinovskiy's statement that Russia should dominate its 
southern neighboring countries including Iran, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers 
such statements as the viewpoints of an irresponsible individual 
and attaches no value to such words." 
  In reply to a question on situation in Iraq the president 
noted: "We had repeatedly condemned Iraqi aggressions in the 
past and believe that the Ba'th Party has treated the Iraqi 
people improperly. On the other hand, we believe that Saudi 
Arabia's measures claimed to be for the salvation of Iraqi 
people is not proper." 
  On the export of the Islamic revolution, the president said 
that the issue of the export of revolution has never been 
raised. "We have said that we would elucidate our ideology and 
those inhezed [as received] could accept it. We will employ all 
our potentials for the developmenf our country." 
  As for the future of Tehran-London ties, given the British 
bugging of the Iranian embassy, the president said that the 
outcome of Britain's illegal measure is mistrust in bilateral 
relations and we do not want to see such an atmosphere of 
mistrust prvail on our reations with other countries. 
  On fluctuations in foreign currency rates, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said measures were underway to adjust supply and demand in order 
to approach the single parity rate. He predicted that the 
actual foreign currency rate will appear in the coming months 
which he said would be lower than the current rates. 
  In reply to a question on the probable amendment of the 
Constitution to facilitate his re-election at the end of the 
presidential tenure, the president said he would rather prefer 
no change in the Constitution. "If I perform my duties properly 
within these eight years, I think there will be no need for 
re-electing me," he added. 
  On foreign investment in Iran President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
said that there was no restriction on the investment of foreign 
countries within the framework of the Islamic Republic 
Constitution. 
  As for foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's participation 
in the Cairo Non-aligned Movement ministerial session, the 
president said that the visit did not imply a change in Iran's 
Middle East policy and Velayati's presence in Egypt was only for 
attending the meeting. 
  On Iran's cooperation with Central Asian republics despite 
U.S. hindrances, he said the areas of cooperation were so 
natural and vast that no one could stop it. However, he added, 
dimensions of cooperation might shrink due to foreign pressures, 
but, it should be noted that Iran and Central Asian region were 
complementary to each other and none could deny it. He also 
noted that Iran was determined to boost its cooperation with 
Asian countries. Cooperation within the framework of the 
Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) as well as bilateral 
cooperation with India and Malaysia were expanding, he said. 
  The president added that tripartite cooperation among Iran, 
Pakistan and India could lead to the formation of a great 
economic grouping in the region and in order to achieve this 
objective, the Indo-Pak differences should be settled. 
  On assassination of Iranian dissidents in some European 
countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the alleged involvement 
of Iranian officials in the killing of Iranian dissidents abroad 
is an unfounded allegation, adding that "we think that the 
killings are the result of inter-group rivalries". He 
underlined that Iran's policy is not to eliminate the dissidents 
but to encourage them to embrace Islam and return to their own 
country. 
  Commenting on the prospect of Iran-Egypt relations, the 
president said: "We believe that by signing the Camp David 
Accord, Egypt created a gulf among the anti-Zionist Muslim and 
Arab countries. Nevertheless we consider Egypt as a great 
Islamic country and welcome conditions enabling us to resume 
relations with that country." 
  In response to a question on Tehran-London relations, 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no need to cut off 
relations, the two countries once witnessed the break-off of the 
relations and found out that it could not change anything. The 
relations, even though at a low level, should exist, we only 
react to any inappropriate action on their part, he added. 
  On Iran-U.S. trade relations, the president said that Iran 
has never broken off its trade relations with the U.S. "As for 
diplomatic relations with the U.S., we believe that the U.S. 
lacks goodwill and it has not taken a proper position during the 
post revolution era. The Americans are for dialogue but we 
think it will not be in our interest to start negotiations," he 
said. "If U.S. officials have good intentions, they should 
first release Iran's frozen assets," the president said. 
  The two countries have a broad trade cooperation, he 
reiterated, adding "a great deal of our military equipment is 
made in the U.S. and therefore we cannot throw away such a great 
national asset." 
  "We showed our goodwill by helping secure the release of 
American hostages in Lebanon but the Washington government did 
not keep its promise of releasing our frozen assets. This 
caused us to lose our trust in them," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. 
  In reply to a question as to reasons for inviting American 
editors to Iran, the president said that not all writers should 
be considered agents of the global arrogance. There are 
freedom-loving people working in foreign mass media who write 
the truth, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. He added that considering 
anti-Iranian propaganda in the U.S., the invitation of American 
journalists was a positive measure. 
  On claims of human rights abuses in Iran raised by the 
global 
arrogance, the president said that human rights were routinely 
violated in the West but "they (Western countries) are making 
hue and cry over the issue because their propaganda machine is 
stronger than ours." 
  "I openly declare that human rights are observed in the 
Islamic Republic better than in any other parts of the world and 
we are ready to debate with anybody who claims otherwise," he 
said. 
  Commenting on planned negotiations in tehran between 
belligerent parties in Tajikistan, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that 
the war was not in the interest of either Tajik government or 
people. He added that Iran would try to restore peace to that 
country in cooperation with the parties involved. On Iran's 
mediation efforts in Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute, he stressed 
that "although the mediation efforts have not been successful 
yet, we have not been disappointed." 
  The continuation of conflict will not benefit either 
Armenia, 
Azerbaijan or Karabakh, the president said, adding that Iran 
intended to launch new efforts to establish peace in the region. 
  In response to a question as to whether or not an Israeli 
pilot was held in Iran, he said for sure no Israeli pilot was in 
Iran. By raising such allegations, the Zionist regime is trying 
to cover up the kidnapping of four Iranians in Lebanon, the 
president said. The Westerners should not view the issue from 
their own self-interested perspective but should also be 
sensitive to the abduction of the four Iranians. 
  On the claim of the United Arab Emirates on the three 
Iranian 
islands in the Persian Gulf, the president warned "the United 
Arab Emirates will gain nothing from such claims and they have 
to cross a sea of blood in order to reach these islands." 
However, Hashemi-Rafsanjani voiced Iran's readiness to 
negotiate with UAE officials on the issue. 
  On Iran's stance on the current crisis in Yemen, the 
president said Iran was against the partition of Yemen, 
believing that Yemen should remain united. 
  He stressed that Iran was not after nuclear weapons, saying 
that this has been confirmed by inspectors of the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who regularly visited Iran. 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani added that "Iran is not for proliferation of 
nuclear arms but is for the nuclear disarmament of all 
countries. Every and each country should try to eliminate 
atomic weapons." 
  On the Middle East peace talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
"what 
is going on now is not peace because during the negotiations the 
rights of the Palestinian nation are denied." He reiterated 
that Iran was not going to interfere in the ongoing negotiations 
between Arabs and the Zionist regime.

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 3 Jun (AE) -- Today, one of President 
Itamar Franco's advisers reported that political pressure on 
Planalto Palace and several ministries has reduced to only three 
the number of state-owned companies' directors who were 
dismissed for converting employees' salaries into Real Value 
Units by the maximum percentage index. Transportation Minister 
Rubem Bayma Denys had estimated that at least 50 managers would 
be dismissed, discharged, or retired as a result of the 
incident. The official gazette, however, only published the name 
of three directors to be dismissed: Rilson Carneiro Raposo, Jose 
Eudes Rangel, and Roberto Vaz da Silva. They are, respectively, 
the president and directors of the Executive Group for the Study 
of Transportation Integration Policy (Geipot). [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chile will probably be the fifth country to join the 
Common Market of the South, Mercosur. Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa and Brazilian counterpart Celso Amorim reported 
this news in Belem, Para State on the night of 5 June. Here is 
Antonia Marcia Vale's report: 
  [Begin recording] [Vale] Since the beginning of the Mercosur 
negotiations, Chile has refused to participate. The Chilean 
foreign minister now states that his country's interest in 
joining Mercosur follows President Itamar Franco's proposal, in 
Chile in December 1993, to establish a free-trade zone in Latin 
America. 
  Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim asserted that if 
Chile joins Mercosur it will be advantageous and represent a 
door for Brazilian exports to the Pacific Region market. 
  [Amorim] This possibility is important for us, not just 
because Chile has commercial and political importance or because 
of old ties that bind our two countries. Mercosur member 
countries have always considered the possibility of Chile 
becoming a member. As the Chilean foreign minister said, this 
initiative is a result of the current Brazilian Government, of 
President Itamar Franco's proposal to establish a South American 
free-trade area. This shows we have indeed been working in the 
right direction. This possibility gives us enormous 
satisfaction. 
  [Vale] The foreign minister reported that Chile's main 
concern about entering Mercosur had been the high taxes charged 
by Brazil on imported items. Minister Amorim added that this 
difficulty has practically ceased because currently our custom 
fees average just 14 percent. [end recording]

Reality"] 
  [Text] On 1 July, Brazil will awaken to the jingle of the 
ninth currency in its history: the real. The 
operation will be unprecedented, since it will not feature the 
traditional chopping off of three zeros to which Brazilians have 
become accustomed since the first monetary reform, in October 
1942, when one thousand reis were swapped for one 
cruzeiro. Divided by the quotation of the URV [Real 
Unit of Value], the real cruzeiros will simply vanish 
from the map, giving rise to an initially strong currency 
equivalent to the U.S. dollar. The Itamar Franco government 
plans to use this trump card to kill two birds with one stone: 
defeat inflation without breaching contracts, and lift former 
Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's [FHC's] candidacy out of 
the doldrums.

  The political objective of the introduction of the new 
currency was exposed with all its colors by the president of 
Brazil when he invited the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] candidate to the ceremony announcing the real, 
held Monday 9 May at Planalto Palace. The announcement itself 
was made by Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero, but it is Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso's future that is at stake. If the 
real flourishes -- at least until 3 October -- his 
candidacy can consolidate itself as an alternative to the 
favorite, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. For that very reason, there 
are those who say the adoption of the new currency was rushed: 
the ideal thing would have been to wait until all the economic 
agents had adapted to the URV, before coining the 
real. But if there was haste to the point of 
destabilizing the new currency, obviously the onus will fall on 
the shoulders of FHC as presidential hopeful. 
  There is no doubt that the backdrop is the race to succeed 
Itamar Franco. But despite the fairly explicit presence of 
Cardoso, the president has tried hard to disavow any connotation 
of political opportunism. "If I stand here today, asking Brazil 
to believe in the real, it is because I am sure that 
we are ready now," said Itamar. And he insisted that what is at 
stake is the daily life of all Brazilians: "Only with the 
economy in order can everyone begin to win -- especially the 
poorest, the workers who live by their paychecks and have no way 
to protect themselves against inflation." Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, who made a point of posing for photos at the 
president's side, also rejected these insinuations: "No one is 
producing the real because of a candidacy." 
  The future will decide whether the real will or 
will not help FHC's candidacy. To Brazilian men and women, 
however, what is important is the new currency's impact on their 
daily lives. And, if we are to believe the words of Minister 
Ricupero, there is no reason to be apprehensive. The new 
currency will be adopted with surgical precision. Starting 1 
July, for an interval initially set at 15 days, the public will 
have to go to the banks to exchange their paper money and coins. 
One real will be worth one URV, which will have its 
value in cruzeiros fixed by the Central Bank. The balances in 
checking or financial investment accounts (the 
fundao, fixed-income funds, commodities funds, etc.) 
will automatically be converted from real cruzeiros 
to reals, also on the basis of the URV of 1 July. To 
facilitate service to the public, banking hours will be extended 
by one hour. Right now there are three billion real 
cruzeiro notes in circulation, equivalent to $3.2 billion. 
By 1 July, 1.9 billion real notes will be 
manufactured -- approximately $27 billion. It is believed that 
with the decline in the inflation rate, the phenomenon 
economists call the "monetization" of the economy will occur. 
That is, once in possession of a strong currency, people will 
use more hard cash. The Central Bank predicts that the volume of 
money in circulation will rise from the present $3.2 billion to 
about $9 billion. The Central Bank's backup inventory of 
currency, which traditionally corresponds to twice the total 
value of notes in circulation, will be $8 billion. 
  The banking system insists that the exchange will take place 
without much trouble. "The banks have flexible systems. Despite 
a conversion unprecedented in this country, the stipulated value 
of the real on 1 July will remain unchanged for 15 
days. We will accomplish the exchange within two or three days, 
easily," explained Claudio Lelis, director of Lloyds Bank. He 
points out that during the Collor Plan, banks had to live for a 
long time with two currencies: the cruzeiro and the 
cruzado. This time, the banks' greatest concern is 
security. "The massive distribution of bills and coins will 
force the banks to beef up their security services," said Luis 
Fernando Faria, director of Banco Itau. Febraban [Brazilian 
Federation of Banks] is negotiating with the Central Bank and 
the Ministry of Finance to obtain Army coverage during the 
currency swap. 
  But the period the banks consider as "black" encompasses the 
months of June and July. This is because uncertainty as to the 
behavior of inflation in July will require them to pay doubly 
close attention when they purchase negotiable instruments. If 
they overvalue the yields on the securities that comprise their 
portfolios, they may incur losses. "June is the time for banks 
to be careful about speculative investments," warns Francisco 
Camargo, director of products at Banco Frances e Brasileiro. "We 
have to pay special attention when negotiating the federal bonds 
to ballast the financial investment and commodities [preceding 
word in English] funds." 
  If replacing the real cruzeiros has been suitably 
solved, there are questions about private contracts, such as 
rent and school tuition. In the case of rents, the government 
hopes tenants and lessors will arrive at a consensus that will 
enable them to "URVatize" their contracts before 1 July. As for 
monthly tuition payments, the suggestion is that schools 
negotiate with the parents of the students on a case-by-case 
basis, also adopting the URV in due time. To prevent uncertainty 
or distress among small savers, the government was quick to 
supply an answer regarding the savings account system. The yield 
will be post-fixed according to a new index yet to be created, 
and guarantees the 0.5 percent of real yield above the inflation 
rate. 
  Having reassured bank account holders and savers, the 
government must still answer the crucial questions that will 
determine the precise profile of the new currency: exchange 
policy and monetary policy. There is no rush with respect to the 
latter, since any mistake would have disastrous effects. As 
regards the exchange rate, economists and businessmen agree that 
the parity to the dollar must be maintained for at least 60 days 
in order to ensure the credibility of the new currency. After 
two months, the currency will begin to suffer slight 
devaluations. "Our economy is more sophisticated than the 
Argentine. It will not permit a fixed exchange rate for very 
long," explains economist Paulo Guedes, of Banco Pactual. In 
short, the real is strong at the starting gate, but 
Brazil is not Switzerland. In the case of interest rates, there 
is no alternative. High interest rates will be the policy, to 
prevent an explosion of consumption. After all, without 
inflation, consumers might rush to the stores as they did during 
the Cruzado Plan. And all that is desired of the real 
is that it not repeat the resounding failure of the 
cruzado. 
<H5>  Operation Rescue -- Government Promotes Adjustments at </H5>
Federal Banks 
  The economic team is making some drastic adjustments at the 
official federal banks, which constitute one of the bottlenecks 
in the implantation of the Real Plan. Simulations done by the 
Ministry of Finance show that the five federal banks -- Banco do 
Nordeste do Brasil, Banco do Brasil, Banco da Amazonia, Caixa 
Economica Federal, CEF [Federal Savings Bank], and Banco 
Meridional -- would operate in the red under a scenario of low 
inflation rates, say 2 percent a month. Among measures designed 
to trim the fat and improve the earnings statements of those 
financial institutions is the shutdown of about 300 branches, 
mostly branches of the CEF and Banco do Brasil. Although the 
decision was made as part of the shift to the real, 
the move had been under study since last year. 
  "The entire financial system is running simulations and 
making adjustments. We are taking care of our banks," said the 
executive secretary of the Finance Ministry, Clovis Carvalho. He 
insists the five banks have been reacting well to the plan, but 
the economic team knows the task is not that easy. Besides 
losing their precious inflation-generated gains, the federal 
banks must also get ready for the withdrawals by the public that 
will start in July. With the reduction of the rates of 
inflation, the public will feel more comfortable about carrying 
cash in their pockets. The government faces another difficulty: 
under election laws, it is forbidden to fire anyone until the 
beginning of next year. The alternative would be to sell off 
real estate and be more energetic in collecting bank fees and 
overdue loans from individuals and companies.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 5 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will resume his 
presidential campaign tomorrow (6 June). During the whole of 
the month of June, and prior to the implementation of the real 
on 1 July, Lula will try to consolidate his lead in the opinion 
polls. The PT will create People's Committees [Comites 
Populares] to promote party activism on the streets. It will 
launch the first of its long-term programs, the job program, and 
will unveil an alternative to the economic program of his main 
opponent, Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party]. In addition, Lula will take new trips. On 6 
June, he will visit Espirito Santo, the only state he has not 
yet visited. All this seeks to counterbalance a possible 
negative impact on his candidacy if the implementation of the 
new currency leads to economic stability. 
  A source close to Lula has reported that "to counterbalance 
the real, on 9 June, Lula will launch a job program, showing 
that curbing the inflation rate is not enough to improve the 
standard of living of the people." He added that "promoting the 
People's Committees throughout Brazil will be a way to take the 
presidential campaign to the streets because up to now, the 
campaign consisted of Lula touring the country by bus. Gilberto 
Carvalho, one of the presidential campaign coordinators, 
reported that within the next few days, the PT will disclose an 
alternative economic plan to the dollarization of the economy, 
in opposition to Cardoso's plan. The idea is to propose another 
currency backing; and to show that Cardoso's economic plan 
caused losses in converting prices to Real Value Units on the 
basis of the peak inflation rate of the four previous months, 
while salaries were converted on the basis of the average 
inflation rate of the four previous months. It also intends to 
prove that Cardoso's economic plan does not foresee a solution 
to the job problem or the achievement of economic growth. 
  In Espirito Santo, Lula plans to hold rallies in Vitoria, 
Linhares, Sao Mateus, Colatina, and Cachoeiro de Itapermirim. 
He will also meet with business and religious leaders. He will 
be in Porto Alegre from 10 to 12 June, and is scheduled to hold 
a rally on 12 June at Vale de Anhangabau in the city of Sao 
Paulo.

Party presidential candidate; "special for CLARIN from COMUNICA 
PRESS"] 
  [Text] Brasilia, 4 May -- We are once again on the eve of 
an Ibero-American meeting of chiefs of state, which will be held 
in Cartagena de las Indias, and are awaiting the December 
meeting of American chiefs of state to be held in Miami. 
  These two events will take place before and after 100 
million 
Brazilians are to elect, in October, their new president, the 
entire Chamber of Deputies, and two-thirds of the Senate. 
  The Workers Party [PT], of which I was president until a few 
days ago and which is the party that is supporting my 
presidential bid, considers these two forums to be very 
important, especially at a time when the world is experiencing 
important transformations and needs to redefine the economic and 
political order that emerged at the end of World War II. 
  This is why we value the Cartagenas meeting, if only it can 
help implement concrete measures to face the serious social 
problems that Latin America is experiencing, especially the high 
degree of poverty. The summit must also contribute toward the 
democratization of Haiti, which presupposes an end to the 
military dictatorship and the return of Jean Bertrand Aristide 
to the presidency. 
  Regarding the Miami meeting, we are concerned about Cuba's 
absence due to the veto of the U.S. Government, which is hosting 
the meeting. Such a decision is not compatible with the efforts 
of rapprochement that are being made in many parts of the world, 
and it maintains an atmosphere on our continent that is 
completely out of time and place with the Cold War that has now 
been overcome. 
  In any case, this is an excellent occasion for Brazil's main 
opposition force, the PT -- which has a real possibility of 
gaining control of government on 1 January 1995 -- to explain 
how it views our position in the world. The main problem that 
is being experienced today in Brazilian foreign policy is the 
absence -- for more than 15 years -- of a national development 
project. 
  In addition to the fact that profound internal changes have 
occurred in that period of time, we have also had 
transformations in the international situation. The end of the 
Soviet Union and the collapse of the Socialist countries, 
symbolized by the fall of the Berlin Wall, have altered, with 
the end of the Cold War, the relations between international 
forces. But the world economy has also suffered very important 
transformations with the emergence of three [as published] great 
focal points: megamarkets and very large productive systems, and 
this has accelerated what many have called the "globalization" 
of the economy. 
  The social and economic problems that these blocs are facing 
within themselves (unemployment, racism, and the advance of the 
extreme right); the economic situation in many areas of the 
"southern" part of the world; and the serious crises that the 
former Socialist countries and many areas of Africa are 
experiencing, permit us to talk about a new international 
(dis)order that is under way. The world is experiencing a 
period of transition and it is not known how it will end. It 
will be very important to take this into account when a new 
foreign policy is formulated for Brazil. 
  Our country must seek the implementation of a new economic 
order that will eliminate the trade and financial blackmail that 
the developed countries impose on a large part of the world, and 
this must be done directly or through international 
organizations. We need to democratize international relations 
by reforming the United Nations, especially its Security 
Council, which was created 50 years ago when the world's 
problems were of another type and quite different from the 
current ones. 
  Brazil's opening up to the world does not mean that we do 
not 
have priorities for the next few years. Latin America, 
especially South America, is the top priority. To strengthen, 
correct, and expand Mercosur [Common Market of the South] is an 
important goal that can accelerate an integration process that 
will include all of South America through the creation of a free 
trade zone in the subcontinent. This process is of fundamental 
importance in achieving more balanced relations with the United 
States and the EU. 
  Brazil must seek to establish more open-minded relations 
with 
such countries as China, India, Russia, and South Africa, and 
especially with the latter country, which is now entering a new 
era. They are countries that cannot be absorbed, as is the case 
with Brazil, by the current blocs; and they also have economic 
potential and an international dimension and bearing that are 
sufficiently important for the implementation of common actions 
in the economic sphere, in specific or more extensive political 
interventions, and in scientific-technical cooperation, etc. 
  Within the next 10 years, Brazil will finally have to 
participate in international initiatives or take them itself, in 
the fields of human rights, preservation of the environment, and 
in the achievement of a more just economic order, especially in 
the case of a new confrontation pertaining to social and labor 
matters at the international level. 
  Strengthening national sovereignty and the implementation of 
national development projects in our continent are not 
incompatible with a policy of continental integration. On the 
contrary, the national projects can and must be made possible 
through a courageous and decided integration policy that will 
make the never-forgotten dream of Simon Bolivar come true on the 
eve of the 21st century.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucio Vaz: "Factions Divide Campaign </F>
Leadership"; followed by an interview with Wander Bueno do 
Prado, Lula's private secretary, by Claudia Trevisan, place and 
date not given: "Adviser To Lula Since 1981"; paragraphs in 
italics as published] 
  [Text] Brasilia -- Most of them are from Sao Paulo, have 
never held elective office, and participated in left-wing 
movements over the past two decades. Four were once guerrilla 
fighters. They are the 13 individuals forming Luiz Inacio Lula 
da Silva's campaign team, and they represent the range of 
factions constituting the PT [Workers Party]. 
  There are only two congressmen in the group, most of whose 
members are intellectuals or party leaders. Deputies in the 
party comment that the leadership is in the hands of "voteless" 
people. 
  The group includes a businessman who is not a member of the 
PT: Oded Grajew. He is active in civil engineering and 
advertising. He collected suggestions from businessmen for the 
program. Now he is going to collect contributions from 
businessmen. 
  The party presidency is held by State Deputy Ruy Falcao (Sao 
Paulo), a leader of the party's left wing. He participated in 
the armed struggle against the military regime as a member of 
the VAR [Revolutionary Armed Vanguard]-Palmares. 
  Falcao does not like to talk about that experience. "What is 
the point of that now? The amnesty erased all that," he says. 
Tried under five articles of the National Security Law, he spent 
three years in prison. 
  Coordination of the campaign will be divided among Falcao, 
Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, and Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (Sao 
Paulo). Greenhalgh represents the party's extreme left wing, 
while Mercadante is closer to the center. He is tipped to be 
Lula's minister of finance. 
  Drafting of the government program will be coordinated by 
Marco Aurelio Garcia, an intellectual who has great influence on 
Lula and who is associated with the center group. 
  Also participating in the coordination are Joao Machado and 
Cesar Benjamin, who represent the left wing. Benjamin stirred up 
controversy by advocating a fourfold increase in the Armed 
Forces budget. 
  The alliances in the states are important in getting Lula 
elected, and they will be monitored by Gilberto Carvalho, the 
party's secretary general. A professor of philosophy linked to 
the progressive wing of the Catholic Church, he has never held 
elective office. He has been a party leader for four years. 
  The PT's advertising in the media is in the hands of the 
party's most radical leader, Markus Sokol of the faction known 
as In the PT Struggle. At the party convention, he advocated 
suspending payment of the foreign debt. 
  The official campaign treasurer will be Tatau Godinho, an 
English professor without much experience as a treasurer. She 
hopes to collect a large amount of money from the party's 
approximately 100,000 members, but is also depending on 
contributions from businessmen. 
  The group also has two intellectuals acting as advisers to 
Lula: Paulo Vanucchi and Amilton Pereira. Both participated in 
the armed struggle. Clara Ant is writing an account of the 
Caravan of Citizenship.

<H5>  Adviser With Lula Since 1981 </H5>
  Wander Bueno do Prado, 41, has been an adviser to Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva longer than anyone. "I know Lula better 
than I know my brother," Prado told FOLHA DE SAO PAULO. 
  A sociologist and former metalworker, Prado went to 
work for Lula in 1981. He has been his private secretary since 
that time. He takes care of Lula's agenda and organizes the 
candidate's life. 
  He left that position only from 1990 to 1992, when he 
coordinated the PT's parallel government (established following 
the defeat in the 1989 presidential election). He returned in 
1993 to organize the caravans of citizenship and participate in 
the campaign. 
  [Trevisan] How did you come to work for Lula? 
  [Prado] I knew Lula from the union movement, but I was more 
closely associated with his brother, Frei Chico. 
  In 1981, I was teaching a few classes and looking for a job. 
I had left my job at the ZF of Brazil metallurgical firm the 
year before. (He completed his sociology course at the Santo 
Andre Foundation in Sao Paulo's ABC [Santo Andre, Sao Bernardo 
do Campo, and Sao Caetano do Sul industrial area] in 1981.) 
  Lula was looking for someone to handle his agenda during the 
1982 gubernatorial campaign in Sao Paulo. Frei Chico recommended 
me, and I accepted. 
  [Trevisan] What was the most difficult political moment you 
witnessed in Lula's career? 
  [Prado] His defeat in the 1982 elections. 
  [Trevisan] Was it worse than his defeat by Fernando Collor 
in 
the 1989 presidential election? 
  [Prado] Much worse. The reason was the number of people we 
managed to attract and then the small number of votes we 
received in the end. (Franco Montoro won the election, and Lula 
ended up in fourth place.) 
  It was about six months before he recovered. The PT had been 
established in 1980, and the defeat caused doubts about the 
party's viability. 
  Lula received a very large number of votes in 1989, and it 
became clear to us that it would be difficult to win the 
presidency. 
  [Trevisan] How often do you talk to Lula? 
  [Prado] Almost every day, either by telephone or in person. 
  [Trevisan] I see that you have a scrambler (a device used to 
prevent telephone wiretapping). Do you use it when talking to 
Lula? 
  [Prado] I bought it last year, but I have never used it. 
When 
we talk about important things, we do so in person. 
  [Trevisan] To what faction in the PT do you belong? 
  [Prado] You will have to believe me. I have never belonged 
to 
any faction, and I have never held a position of leadership in 
the party. 
  I have always felt that holding office in the PT would be 
incompatible with a position in which I am so close to the party 
president.

Para State] 
  [Text] Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim and Russian 
Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy Mamedov have signed an agreement 
to exchange military attaches between the two countries. 
Mamedov, who is attending the 24th OAS General Assembly as an 
observer, stated that the agreement does not entail any form of 
ideological agreement, but rather stems from mutually 
advantageous relations. 
  Mamedov said Russia and Brazil are following the same path 
toward promoting democratization in the world. He described 
Brazil as a priority partner for Russia. He noted that the 
agreement will pave the way for implementing several cooperation 
projects between the Russian and Brazilian Armed Forces, in 
addition to promoting the transfer of technology. 
  The agreement may also be instrumental in improving the 
bilateral trade balance, which last year stood at $300 million. 
Foreign Ministry experts consider this figure to be well below 
the potential for trade between the two countries. Foreign 
Minister Amorim will visit the Russian Federation in December to 
sign new agreements.

  [Excerpts] The Federal Police have seized 7 tonnes of 
cocaine hidden inside tobacco boxes in Tocantins State. This is 
the largest drug seizure ever made in Brazil. The operation 
began yesterday at a farm in the municipality of Guarai in 
Tocantins State. 
  The Federal Police have been closely watching this area in 
Tocantins State, where the drug traffickers own a 750 hectare 
farm whose sole purpose, according to police, is to receive 
drugs. 
  The trucks loaded with cocaine were intercepted near the 
Belem-Brasilia highway. They had been planning to travel 
directly to the port of Santos [Sao Paulo State], where the 
drugs were to be shipped to the United States. 
  The police are surprised at the organizational level of the 
drug traffickers. The drugs were hidden inside tobacco bundles 
purchased in Rio Grande do Sul, and brought here through 
operations carried out by ghost firms. After weighing the drugs 
the police confirmed a surprising 7 tonnes of cocaine. [passage 
omitted] 
  According to the police agents who commanded this operation, 
the cocaine was brought into Brazil by Colombian drug 
traffickers, to some as yet unidentified point in Rondonia 
State. From there, it was flown in small Brazilian airplanes to 
their probable refueling base in the city of Alta Floresta in 
Mato Grosso State, from where the cocaine was flown to the farm 
in Guarai, Tocantins and unloaded. 
  Following a shootout at the farm, the police arrested seven 
drug traffickers. The leader, a Lebanese who had become a 
naturalized Brazilian citizen, Nasrat Jamil Hazul, is a 
businessman from Foz do Iguacu and Paraguay. According to the 
police, the drug traffickers expected to earn a lot of money 
because they spent nearly $1 million bringing the drugs from 
Colombia. [passage omitted] 
  In making a final control of the weight of the drugs, the 
police found an additional half tonne of cocaine. This means 
that the police seized 7.5 tonnes of cocaine. The police found 
and arrested three other drug traffickers. The gang members 
confessed that last year they sent 2 tonnes of cocaine abroad 
using this same route. 
  The police arrested two men that were in charge of the 
bureaucratic procedures of the drug trafficking gang. All the 
documents that the gang needed were forged on the fifth floor of 
this building downtown in Sao Paulo. Today here, the Federal 
Police arrested forwarding agent Sergio Ricardo de Souza, who 
already had a police record for forging documents. The police 
likewise arrested business administrator Jacques Juarez 
Minicozky. Souza was in charge of forging the lading bills, 
while Minicozky had found a way to have them legalized. This 
bill of lading, for example, was made in December of last year, 
probably to cover another cocaine shipment. It was made in the 
name of the In-Out Comercial Exportadora Lta., a ghost company 
created by the two men. 
  The police also confiscated several seals and documents, 
including this passport which was to be used by the man 
responsible for receiving the drugs in the United States. 
Minicozky told the police he would receive $10,000 for forging 
the bill of lading and for looking after the bureaucratic 
proceedings for shipping the containers. Minicozky and Souza 
are under arrest for using false documents, and a Tocantins 
judge has asked for their temporary imprisonment.

<F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 5 Jun (AE) -- The expansion of the 
Landless People's Movement (MST) in Brazil was on the agenda of 
a meeting the 14 Army High Command generals held at the end of 
May. Military reports say that documents prepared by the Army 
reveal that in addition to the Trabalhadores Ranch in 
Pernambuco, land invaders have another training area known as 
"Cacador University" in Santa Catarina in the town of Cacador. 
  Most Army reports on landless people's action were prepared 
by the Southern Military Command, which covers Rio Grande do 
Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana. The Army considers these states 
the most critical because of frequent land occupations and the 
methods landless people use in their operations. There is also 
major concern about Sao Paulo State, which the military has 
placed in fourth place because of the large number of land 
occupations. Next comes Pernambuco as the state with the next 
largest number of occupations. 
  Army reports show that "Cacador University" is an old 
convent 
that priests donated to the Landless People's Movement. Various 
types of training are given in the convent, which landless 
people have christened a "university" because it is considered a 
school. According to military sources, the slogan of the group 
occupying this area is "occupy, resist, and produce." 
  According to information gathered by the Army, when someone 
outside the MST gets near the area, landless people abandon all 
suspicious activities that might prove they were undergoing 
training and begin chanting church songs in an attempt to show 
they were in a cult. 
  A Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) document, to which O 
ESTADO had exclusive access this week, also mentioned "Cacador 
University." SAE also considers the "university" a landless 
people's training area. 
  The Army reports always mention the Military Police's rapid 
intervention in all the places where land occupations have been 
reported. Army officers are concerned because if the Military 
Police are overwhelmed or if help is needed to enforce the 
Constitution, the Army will be called in. This is why the Army 
believes it is justified in closely following all landless 
people's movements. 
  At Army High Command meetings, generals always evaluate 
landless people's action. The matter never has a noticeable 
place on the agenda, but it surfaces either as part of the 
debates or as a subject for an exchange of information among 
military commanders whenever they discuss the national situation.

<F P=106> [By Walter Sotomayor] </F>
  [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Toppled 
Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide today rejected the use 
of violence as a means to restore democracy and to return him to 
the government of that Caribbean country. 
  Aristide, who was elected in December 1990 and toppled by a 
military coup in September 1991, expressed his views before the 
OAS Ad Hoc Commission tasked with following up on the Haitian 
crisis. The deposed president attended the inaugural session of 
the 24th period of OAS regular sessions in this city in 
northeastern Brazil at the special invitation of the president 
of this country, Itamar Franco [words indistinct] violence and 
we must continue talking about reconciliation," Aristide said at 
a news conference held after his speech to the foreign ministers 
of the 34 member countries of the inter-American organization. 
  "So far, we have tried (to restore constitutionality) 
through 
peaceful means and we have not yet exhausted them," the Haitian 
president-in-exile added, as he proposed new actions to 
intensify the economic and commercial blockade against his 
country. "As soon as we step up pressure on the coupists they 
will not be able to stay in power," Aristide said. "I am not 
requesting a military occupation but, based on an agreement 
signed at Governors Island (New York, United States), the 
international community knows what to do to avoid limiting its 
actions to words," he added. 
  The Haitian president pointed out that when he referred to 
the coupist officers, he was talking about a "small group of 
soldiers involved in drug trafficking" and added that Haiti now 
ranks second in the continent for its involvement in drug 
trafficking. Aristide pointed out that "if it was not the main 
reason, drug trafficking was among the major reasons for the 
coup d'etat," after noting that he was committed to fight drug 
trafficking and had signed an agreement on this matter with the 
United States shortly before the military intervention. 
  He recalled that while he led the government, he stepped up 
the struggle against drug trafficking, but now there is talk 
about 48 tons of cocaine that pass through Haiti producing an 
estimated $1.2 billion. 
  Likewise, he explained that Haitian political problems are 
structural in nature in a nation with a tradition of coups. 
Haiti was the first nation with a black population in the world 
to obtain its independence when it became free from France in 
1804. It has had 36 presidents of which 24 fell as a result of 
military coups d'etat. 
  Aristide assured that the Armed Forces, comprising 7,000 
men, 
used 40 percent of the national budget. He claimed that during 
the 32 months of the de facto regime commanded by General Raoul 
Cedras, he has lacked the means to communicate with the people 
who elected him, indicating it was important to break this 
information barrier. 
  During his speech to the "Ad Hoc" Committee, Aristide 
presented to the international community four courses of action 
against Haiti. The measures highlight the need for swift action 
to remove the military from the government, a six-month presence 
of a U.N. mission in Haiti, his return to the country, and the 
fulfillment of the New York agreements. 
  During the news conference held in French, Aristide also 
presented his government's projects which place particular 
emphasis on restructuring the judicial system and on 
investments, aimed at overcoming the Haitian people's serious 
social problems.

  [Text] Belem do Para, 7 June (AFP) -- The 34 countries of 
the OAS approved a resolution on Tuesday that leaves the door 
open for a future armed intervention in Haiti. 
  The foreign ministers approved the resolution, the product 
of 
long hours of negotiations, within the framework of the General 
Assembly that has met since Monday in Belem do Para, Brazil. 
The matter that extended the private negotiations, according to 
diplomats who participated, dealt with the insistence by some 
countries that the new actions that are endorsed in a general 
manner in the last paragraph of the preamble of the draft 
resolution be limited to the "peaceful" area. In the final 
version of the draft seen by the foreign ministers, this 
limitation was left out of the text. 
  The above-mentioned paragraph takes into account "the 
relevancy for the members to strengthen the necessary political 
and diplomatic actions to bring about a lasting solution to the 
Haitian crisis within the framework of the OAS Charter and 
international law." 
  "It is a triumph for the United States because, although it 
does not endorse or even mention an intervention, it does not 
exclude it either," a diplomat who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told AFP.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Carlos Santana] </F>
  [Text] Belem, 7 Jun (AE) -- The OAS General Assembly 
approved here today a resolution that rules out military 
intervention in Haiti and states that the restoration of 
democracy in the Caribbean country, through the reinstatement of 
the government led by Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was 
elected in 1990 and ousted in September 1991, should be achieved 
by reinforcing the trade, commercial, and financial embargo 
approved earlier by the United Nations and the OAS. 
  The committee charged with drafting the resolution worked 
until 0300 today to iron out wording problems, to avoid 
ambiguity, and to make it reflect the thinking of the majority 
of the OAS member countries. This effort was aimed at ensuring 
that the draft resolution would be readily approved by the 
plenum. 
  In a speech before a special session on Haiti yesterday, 
ousted Haitian President Aristide stated that he was not calling 
for a military occupation of Haiti because to do so would entail 
violating the Constitution. "In any case," he said, "I truly 
believe some action can be taken to free our nation from the 
thieves who are holding it hostage and to restore democracy. I 
will not waste time describing what type of action should be 
taken. The international community knows how to proceed." 
  Aristide's words sounded at the plenary session like an 
endorsement of a prompt military intervention that would be 
immediately followed by his return to Port-au-Prince along with 
the UN technical assistance mission. 
  The OAS has decided to pay heed only to Aristide's request 
that the trade embargo and the isolation of Haiti be 
strengthened, even if this means prolonging the hardships the 
Haitians are enduring. The embargo is being violated by some 
countries that the diplomats have chosen not to identify, with 
the exception of former Argentine Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, 
who charged Colombia and Venezuela with violating it. The 
embargo is reportedly hurting only the lower income groups of 
the Haitian population, especially those residing near the 
border with the Dominican Republic. 
  On the first day of the assembly, at least two delegates 
endorsed President Aristide's proposal to remove the military 
regime. One of them was Dante Caputo, UN special envoy to 
Haiti. Speaking at the plenary session, he said he doubted the 
effectiveness of the economic sanctions because there are 
countries that are not observing them. Defending the forceful 
removal of the Haitian military, Caputo said: "The time has come 
to say no to the Haitian dictatorship." 
  Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, stated that 
the United States fully endorses the proposal to strengthen the 
embargo, and that it would not mind unilaterally suspending 
commercial flights to and from Haiti should this measure be 
unacceptable to the other OAS member countries. He also 
expressed doubts about when the economic sanctions would yield 
results, and noted that Washington would not oppose military 
intervention if the coupists resisted. 
  Yet voices contrary to this intention, including that of 
Brazil, have apparently prevailed. Most foreign ministers ruled 
out this possibility and expressed confidence that the embargo 
will yield results as long as it is observed by the entire Latin 
American and international community. 
  The OAS resolution approved today begins by citing earlier 
resolutions and by noting that the Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission "has confirmed that the overall human rights 
situation in Haiti reflects an extremely serious deterioration 
of and disregard for essential human rights, as a result of a 
systematic plan of intimidation and terror used against a 
helpless people." 
  The resolution notes that "the coup disrupted constitutional 
order, which affected the exercise of democracy. It is 
essential to restore this." It then outlines the approved 
decisions, including appeals, condemnations, and 
recommendations. The OAS congratulates the International 
Civilian Mission for its dedicated effort to guarantee a minimum 
of freedom in Haiti. It asks for a greater number of personnel 
so the group can cover the entire Haitian territory. It 
proposes starting, without delay, an educational program in the 
area of human rights to help the Haitian people, and reiterates 
the need to reinforce the embargo with measures "such as the 
suspension of commercial flights, the freezing of the assets of 
the de facto regime and its supporters, and the suspension of 
international financial transactions with Haiti." 
  The resolution also requests that neighboring countries 
"examine the possibility of providing the Civilian Mission with 
the radio broadcasting facilities needed to carry out 
educational programs on human rights." Finally, it urges the 
OAS member states and the international community to help deal 
with the problems of Haitians who are leaving their country at 
great personal risk, by granting them the status of refugees and 
offering them temporary protection

  [Text] Belem, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Mexico advocated 
that the international community intensify its diplomatic 
actions for attaining a peaceful and political solution to the 
crisis in Haiti and overcoming the impasse in the Haitian 
situation. Jorge Pinto Mazal, Mexican undersecretary of foreign 
affairs, rejected the idea that the Haitian problem represents a 
threat to world peace and security, and he considered that the 
only "acceptable" option is a negotiated solution. 
  The crisis in Haiti has become the most controversial topic 
discussed by the foreign ministers at the 24th OAS General 
Assembly that is taking place in Belem, capital of Para State, 
some 1,650 km north of Brasilia. 
  Speaking during the sixth session of the OAS Ad Hoc 
Commission, Pinto Mazal, who is also under secretary for Latin 
America, Cultural Affairs, and International Cooperation at the 
Mexican Foreign Ministry, proposed "encouraging commitments that 
will allow for overcoming the deadlock in Haiti." Mexico 
supports strengthening the international civilian mission, and 
he hopes to find the adequate political means for supporting the 
efforts of the democratic sectors of Haitian society in a 
determined, specific, and solidaristic manner, Pinto Mazal added. 
  Earlier in the day, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu 
stated that the majority of the OAS country members are opposed 
to military intervention in Haiti because they consider this 
would break international law and would affect the security of 
the hemisphere. "Most OAS members are against an intervention 
in Haiti to reinstate deposed President Jean Bertrand Aristide 
in his post," Abreu said during the 24th General Assembly of the 
organization. The Uruguayan minister also pronounced himself in 
favor of strengthening the commercial embargo decreed by the 
United Nations and the OAS and called on all countries to comply 
with the blockade to get the Haitian military coupist personnel 
to leave. 
  For his part, Jamaican Foreign Minister Benjamin Clare 
agreed 
on the need to find paths for a negotiated solution to the 
Haitian crisis and said his government will cooperate with the 
United Nations to strengthen the blockade against this Caribbean 
nation. 
  The military government headed by General Raoul Cedras is 
being subjected to an international blockade and strong 
pressures to bring about a return to constitutional order and 
respect for the agreements signed at Governors Island, New York, 
last year. The penalties, which began to be implemented on 21 
May, ban commercial flights to and from Haiti and ask 
governments not to allow the coupists officers, headed by Gen. 
Cedras, to enter their territories. 
  The Haitian crisis, Cuba's return to the OAS, the Dominican 
elections, and the call to the Summit of the Americas by the 
United States are the topics to be studied by the ministers in 
Belem do Para until next Friday.

  [Text] Belem do Para, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Former Argentine 
Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who is the OAS and UN special 
envoy to Haiti, stated today -- 6 June -- that there is very 
little time left to find a peaceful solution to the Haitian 
crisis. 
  Upon urging 34 foreign ministers of OAS member countries who 
are attending the 24th OAS General Assembly to issue "a 
diplomatic ultimatum" to the Haitian military to relinquish 
power, Caputo said: "We do not have a year left; we only have a 
few more weeks to resolve the crisis peacefully." 
  Caputo, who gave a detailed account of the Haitian situation 
and reported numerous human rights violations in that country, 
stated that the international community must issue an ultimatum 
to the Haitian military because "we only have a few more weeks 
to resolve this peacefully." 
  Caputo indicated that if the international community 
continues to let time go by without taking action, armed 
intervention in the Caribbean island will become necessary. He 
said: "Just as we condemn armed interventions, we should also 
condemn the lack of action that is leading us to a void. We 
cannot simply condemn intervention while doing nothing to 
prevent it." 
  Speaking at an ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers on 
Haiti, Caputo bluntly stated that it is "intolerable that only 
7,000 armed men (the Haitian military) are forcing the will of 
the entire international community." 
  Caputo, who admitted to having overlooked diplomatic 
practice 
to urge the OAS states to decree an ultimatum against the 
Haitian military, stated that the UN sanctions and those 
recommended by the OAS are not yielding the expected results. 
  He added that action should be taken to enforce those 
measures adopted earlier, which are not being observed, before 
discussing the adoption of new ones. 
  After reviewing the Haitian situation and the Haitian 
military's persistence in staying in power, Caputo stated that 
three main objectives must be accomplished: force the generals 
to leave power, reinstate democratically elected President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and send an international mission to the 
island to guarantee protection to the new authorities and 
provide assistance to the population. 
  Caputo reported that the mission of human rights observers 
to 
Haiti reported 210 out-of-court executions from 1 January to 13 
May this year, and that there are countless cases of other human 
rights violations committed by the military forces. 
  Commenting on the Haitian domestic situation, Caputo stated 
that the appointment, a month ago, of a provisional president by 
the military was not supported by leading Haitian businessmen 
themselves, who have been allies of the coup plotters, thus 
showing that there is no consensus within the island. 
  Caputo added that the worst thing is that General Cedras "is 
convinced that he will remain in power until 1997 -- when 
Aristide's constitutional term expires -- and that no one, not 
even the international community, will force him to relinquish 
power." 
  In his closing remarks, Caputo said that he believes "there 
is still room for a diplomatic solution," but there is not much 
time left to achieve it. 
  Caputo added that the sanctions that have been adopted must 
be enforced, and that an ultimatum must be given to the 
military. Caputo said: "We must make the Haitian military 
understand that we are giving them a last chance, and that if 
they do not leave...." 
  Caputo noted that if the international community fails to 
find a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis, it would be 
proof that "we have failed in building the much-desired 
international system to defend democracy." 
  Caputo addressed the ad-hoc meeting of OAS foreign ministers 
a few minutes after President Aristide suggested the need for an 
armed action against the coup plotters who usurped power in 1991. 
  Speaking to the OAS foreign ministers, the Haitian 
constitutional president stated that the international community 
must take quick, powerful action to overthrow the military who 
had forced him out of power. 
  The other speaker at the special meeting was OAS Secretary 
General Joao Baena Soares himself, who advocated a peaceful 
solution to the Haitian crisis.

  [Excerpt] Belem do Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican 
Republic Foreign Minister [title as received] Juan Aristides 
Tavares said today that his country should not be blamed for the 
failure of the blockade imposed on Haiti by the international 
community. 
  In a speech to foreign ministers of OAS member countries, 
whose 24th General Assembly is taking place in the Amazonian 
city of Belem Do Para in northern Brazil, Tavares said that many 
countries are wrong to blame his country for the failure of the 
sanctions imposed on the Haitian military regime. 
  Although he admitted that the Dominican Republic believes 
the 
embargo imposed by the OAS and the United Nations is an "unjust 
and inhuman" sanction, the Dominican foreign minister said his 
government strives to comply with international agreements. 
  OAS and UN observers sent to Haiti argue that the border 
between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which share the Island 
of Hispaniola, is the most vulnerable point of the economic 
blockade imposed by the international community to force General 
Raoul Cedras to relinquish power and allow President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide to return to that country. 
  "We defend the embargo despite considering it unjust and 
inhuman," Tavares said as he reaffirmed that the government in 
Santo Domingo has made several efforts to close its border with 
Haiti. The Dominican foreign minister added that the political 
party of President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking reelection, 
lost the elections in all border provinces because the 
deployment of more than 12,000 soldiers to the region "has made 
life impossible for the area's inhabitants," he added. Tavares 
said surveillance operations along the more than 300-km-long 
border of abysses and mountains has consumed a large amount of 
resources that should have been targeted to social investments. 
  "Ever since it was promulgated, the embargo has been 
ineffective and has been constantly violated by countries that 
continue to do business with Haiti; it is unfair to blame the 
Dominican Republic for the failure of sanctions against Haitian 
soldiers," Tavares said. "It has been suggested that the 
failure was caused by my country's attitude toward the 
sanctions, and that is not so. If the embargo failed it is 
because of the attitude of those countries that continue to do 
business with Haiti," the Dominican foreign minister added.

  [Excerpts] Belem, Brazil, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Brazilian 
President Itamar Franco stated here today that he is in favor of 
the OAS studying the readmission of Cuba, which is the only 
country that has been excluded from the organization. 
  Franco returned today to Brasilia after attending the 
opening 
of the 24th OAS General Assembly, which is due to close on 10 
June. He said: "The OAS must look at the Cuban situation." 
[passage omitted] 
  In his speech at the OAS plenary, Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim stated that he has observed positive signs of a 
democratic reform in Cuba, which must be both deepened and 
encouraged. 
  Amorim, who is a 52-year-old career diplomat, said: "We have 
expectations for democratic progress in that country, with which 
Brazil maintains friendly relations and major cultural ties." 
  The head of Brazilian diplomacy added that "we do not view 
economic and political isolation as the best way to contribute 
to promoting a transition that is already in the making." 
  On 6 June, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo 
proposed at the OAS plenary session that the OAS undertake 
negotiations aimed at promoting democratization with the Havana 
government and with all other parties concerned.

  [Text] This morning during his speech at the 24th OAS 
General Assembly in Belem do Para, Brazil, Paraguayan Foreign 
Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner asked the rich countries to 
increase their cooperation with poor countries to fight poverty 
and seek development. Addressing the other OAS foreign 
ministers, the Paraguayan foreign minister also endorsed the 
enhancement, development, and progress of the democratic system 
in all the American countries. 
  Ramirez Boettner criticized the gap between rich and poor 
countries, claiming that after the end of the Cold War, world 
assistance funds to overcome poverty and seek development have 
become increasingly scarce and inaccessible. Ramirez Boettner 
emphasized: "And it is surprisingly paradoxical that, when the 
new international order makes clamorous announcements of an era 
of international cooperation and solidarity, there actually are 
so many symptoms of a growing and fragmentary isolationism 
between the rich and the poor." 
  Ramirez Boettner then asked for increased cooperation 
between 
rich and poor countries for the sake of the development and 
well-being of most countries. He added that international aid 
to enhance democracy and reduce poverty "has become elusive and 
preconditioned." 
<H5>  Democracy for All </H5>
  In his message to the OAS foreign ministers' meeting, 
Ramirez 
Boettner deplored the fact that democracy has not reached all 
American countries and that there still are exceptions. Ramirez 
Boettner said: "All of us want all our American brothers to 
equally join in democratic development and progress, with the 
restoration of all liberties." 
  In order to receive more technical and financial assistance 
from the "rich" countries, the foreign minister pointed out that 
it is necessary for American countries to close ranks and raise 
in successive meetings the hopes of the poorest countries. 
  In his message to the OAS General Assembly, the Paraguayan 
foreign minister asked that the Inter-American System be 
enhanced and strengthened. 
<H5>  Will Return Tomorrow </H5>
  After participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly in this 
Brazilian city, Ramirez Boettner will return to our country at 
1050 on 8 June. On 9 June, Ramirez Boettner will join President 
Wasmosy on a visit to Montevideo, Uruguay, to dedicate the 
dredging of the Martin Garcia channel.

  [Text] Belem do Para, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Panamanian Vice 
Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero stated here today that the 
Panamanian Government will not accept "the slightest change" in 
the terms and timetable established in the Torrijos-Carter 
treaty for the handover of the Panama Canal to Panama. 
  Cordero emphasized the significance of faithfully complying 
with the accords signed in 1977 by Panama and the United States, 
which sought to decolonize Panama. He added that the canal 
"must come under absolute Panamanian domain and sovereignty." 
  Today, Cordero addressed the 24th OAS General Assembly, 
which 
opened on 6 June at the city of Belem, Para State, in the 
Brazilian Amazon region. The assembly is due to close on 10 
June. 
  Cordero noted the interest of President Guillermo Endara's 
government in promoting a constitutional reform that would 
guarantee a professional administration of the Panama Canal as 
soon as it comes under complete Panamanian jurisdiction five 
years from now. 
  Cordero added that a professional administration, through an 
autonomous organization, would prevent the canal from being 
affected by political ups and downs and will reassure its 
customers around the world. 
  Cordero also outlined a number of international agreements 
to 
fight drug trafficking signed by Panama with the United States, 
Great Britain, Central American countries, Colombia, and the 
United Nations.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with OAS Secretary General Joao </F>
Clemente Baena Soares on 2 June; place not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [AGENCIA ESTADO] The first test 
of the OAS resolution signed in Santiago to punish attacks 
against democracy was the coup d'etat in Haiti, but the 
organization has subsequently been relegated to the sidelines. 
Why? 
  [Baena Soares] People say the OAS had three opportunities to 
apply the Santiago Resolution No. 1080, as if it were a soccer 
game. They say the OAS lost the first game in Haiti, tied the 
second in Peru, and won the third in Guatemala. But things are 
not like that. This is not a game. These are political 
situations with changing circumstances that require individual 
treatment. The OAS reacted to the coup immediately. The other 
positive aspect is that not one member country recognized the de 
facto government. The third positive result was the 
organization of an OAS mission under Augusto Ramirez Ocampo 
which created a favorable climate in the OAS for the signing of 
two commitments. Nothing new happened subsequently. Everything 
was included in those two documents. The crisis could have been 
solved five months after it started. 
  [AGENCIA ESTADO] Why did it not conclude? 
  [Baena Soares] Because of ambiguous behavior, rhetorical 
support attitudes, and disagreements over OAS decisions, we have 
not faced the real cause of the problem yet, that is, the 
coalition between Haitian military and entrepreneurs. That 
association of interests never accepted the election result of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristides. Everything we have done has 
been peripheral. I think it was not necessary to resort to the 
United Nations. Compulsory sanctions or recommendations yield 
the same result or they have no result because both depend on 
the political willingness to apply them. OAS measures on Haiti 
were not fully implemented. There was a lot of enthusiasm at 
the time of voting, but very little enthusiasm to implement them. 
  [AGENCIA ESTADO] There are indications that the United 
States 
could be preparing an invasion of Haiti. You made your 
opposition to the initiative clear. Why? 
  [Baena Soares] The OAS mission in Haiti is a civilian 
mission. That was the mandate I received from member countries. 
It is also necessary to see things from a practical point of 
view. Haiti was invaded and occupied (by the United States) for 
19 years. The result was the Duvalier era and General Avril. 
The consequences of this continue to affect the country today. 
Therefore, I doubt there is a more effective solution than a 
peaceful solution, a negotiated solution, to encourage Haitians 
themselves to define what they want. 
  [AGENCIA ESTADO] We were already negotiating with the 
Haitian 
generals but at the moment of surrendering power they went back 
on their word. 
  [Baena Soares] Why did they go back on their word? Because 
they felt they had support. I have already seen this film on 
Haiti three times. We must attack the causes of the problem.

  [Text] Belem, Para (Brazil), 6 Jun (EFE) -- On 6 June, 
Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa told EFE NEWS AGENCY 
that Chile will establish a free trade zone with the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur), composed of Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay, within 10 years, at the very most. 
  Figueroa added that the Chilean Government will formalize 
its 
proposal in a document to be submitted to Argentine Foreign 
Minister Guido Di Tella, who is also Mercosur Council chairman, 
on 8 June. 
  The Chilean foreign minister is participating in the 24th 
OAS 
General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in Para 
State's Amazon region, on 6 June and will continue its 
deliberations until 10 June. 
  Figueroa noted: "We have not joined Mercosur due to 
difficulties arising from import duties." 
  Chile levies an 11 percent tariff on all imports regardless 
of the country of origin, whereas Mercosur member countries levy 
higher tariffs, the rate of which varies according to products. 
  After a meeting with Mercosur foreign ministers in Belem, 
Minister Figueroa announced on 5 June that Chile will join 
Mercosur as an associate rather than full member. He 
nonetheless did not rule out the possibility of his country 
joining Mercosur in the future. 
  Chile is one of the Latin American countries with the 
highest 
growth rate and the largest volume of foreign trade. It is the 
only country in the region that has not joined any integration 
movements in South America like Mercosur, the Andean Group, and 
the Amazon Pact. 
  Figueroa said this decision will not produce changes in the 
negotiations his country is undertaking with the United States, 
the main partner of NAFTA, which also comprises Canada and 
Mexico. 
  The foreign minister added that the Treaty of Asuncion 
allows 
"any country" that does not belong to other economic blocs "to 
join" Mercosur. 
  Mercosur was established in March 1991 by Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay. These countries had invited Chile to 
join Mercosur since its inception but to no avail. At that 
time, Chilean authorities contended that they would rather not 
join this integration movement since Chile's import duties were 
lower than those of its neighbors.

  [Begin recording] [Abreu] Well, the meeting that was 
proposed 
by the Chilean foreign minister presupposes the political 
intention of strengthening trade ties and relations with 
Mercosur. 
  This is contemplated in the Treaty of Asuncion, in other 
words, that any country can become an associate as long as it 
does not belong to a subregional agreement, and this is the case 
with Chile. 
  But Chile's proposal presupposes the beginning of 
negotiations at the technical and political levels that can lead 
us step by step to an incorporation that will give credibility, 
strength, and projection to Mercosur in that the four countries 
comply with all its obligations and, of course, are accepted by 
the partners that wish to join it afterward. 
  [Unidentified reporter] The other case is Haiti, which has 
caused concern in both the region and the entire world. 
  [Abreu] Well, within the political sphere we all know about 
the international repercussions that the violation of human 
rights by the military government has had in Haiti and 
especially the actions that go against the compliance with 
obligations that have been assumed for the restoring of a 
democratic system. 
  We are discussing this subject and there are proposals from 
some of the countries, but Uruguay is maintaining a solid 
position regarding the need for restoring democracy, but 
fundamentally based on an unrestricted respect for the principle 
of nonintervention, which is one of the legal bases of the 
inter-American system, and which also happens to be one of 
Uruguay's purest traditions in the matter of international law.

  [Text] Brazil will head the Inter-American Human Rights 
Forum until 1996. This decision was made by representatives of 
21 nongovernmental organization (NGO) countries who met in 
Brasilia. Between 24 and 29 April, 70 NGO's met in Brasilia to 
create the forum that will work in coordination with the OAS. 
  Among its objectives, the forum will report on and clarify 
human rights violations. It will also promote an exchange 
between NGO's and the governments of the Americas. The forum 
will be directed by a secretariat of seven countries. The 
United States, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Venezuela, and 
Paraguay are the members of the secretariat. 
  Benedito Domingos Mariano, director of the Santo Dias Human 
Rights Center of Sao Paulo, was elected secretary general. He 
will organize the structure of the new Inter-American 
organization, promoting the creation of branches in each of the 
21 countries of the forum. The objective is to follow the model 
of Amnesty International. 
  Oscar Sappiano, the OAS Inter-American Human Rights 
Commission president, attended the Brasilia meeting. He 
proposed that the forum should join the commission's 
consultative council. 
  This position will give the forum the right to participate 
in 
investigating human rights violations throughout the continent. 
  The Inter-American Human Rights Forum will be connected with 
the seven-judge, OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court which 
passes moral judgment on the governments that violate the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The forum will also help 
to prepare the annual human rights record reports submitted by 
various governments to the United Nations.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (EFE) -- The Cuban Foreign Ministry 
today confirmed that the crew of a Coast Guard vessel fired 
several shots at a boat that had illegally sailed from Mariel, 
approximately 30 km from Havana. 
  During a scheduled meeting with the media, Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Miguel Alfonso said the boat and the crew had been 
seized earlier "and this represents an act of piracy and 
kidnapping." Alfonso added that "there are certain elements 
that make us think this was a planned action" because the people 
who seized the vessel "tied up some of the crew members." The 
Foreign Ministry spokesman added that "the Coast Guard vessel 
pursued them, we fired some shots; I do not know if they also 
fired shots, and after a while the pursuit ended." 
  Alfonso did not say how many people were on the boat, 
whether 
anyone was wounded, or whether some of the crew members were 
involved in this action. The spokesman did say, however, that 
the boat, and some of the crew members, are now back in Cuba. 
  According to statements made by the escapees on arrival in 
the United States, there were 61 people on board. Four of them, 
including a child, were wounded when the Coast Guard crew opened 
fire on them.

  [Text] OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares called for 
Cuba's full reinstatement to the OAS during a speech he 
delivered at the inaugural session of the 24th OAS Assembly, 
which began today and concludes Friday in Belem, Brazil. 
  The nineties are not the sixties, Baena Soares said in 
reference to Cuba's suspension from the OAS in 1962, when the 
East-West conflict was raging. He also recalled the efforts he 
made a long time ago in favor of having the measure reexamined. 
  After serving two consecutive mandates for a total of 10 
years as the regional organization's general secretary, Baena 
Soares stressed that during his tenure, peace was restored in 
the Americas, and yet, at the same time, there was growing 
dissatisfaction over persistent difficulties and increasing 
poverty. 
  Baena Soares also spoke of his failed efforts to restore 
Haiti's constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to 
power, but he admitted the organization had not exhausted every 
peaceful means to try to force the aggressors against democracy 
and against the Haitian people to give up power. The outgoing 
OAS secretary general expressed his resolve to continue 
supporting efforts to achieve a peaceful resolution of the 
Haitian crisis. 
  Meanwhile, Itamar Franco, president of the host country 
Brazil, addressed the foreign ministers and representatives of 
the OAS' 34 member-countries. He praised Baena Soares' efforts 
and predicted that new Secretary General Cesar Gaviria will also 
derive positive results from equally hard work.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Carlos Tello Macias, 
Mexican ambassador to Cuba, said in Havana today that the U.S. 
embargo against Cuba "hampers but does not impede or, much less, 
destroy" Mexico's relations with the Cuban Government. 
  The U.S. blockade, initiated three decades ago, "creates 
unnecessary friction" in the region. As such, Mexico "has again 
and again appealed to the United States to lift it," Tello told 
NOTIMEX. The U.S. commercial retaliation against Cuba "puts 
stumbling blocks" between Mexico and Cuba, "but those stumbling 
blocks can be overcome," said the 56-year-old diplomat and 
economist who this year assumed office as ambassador to Havana. 
"In exercising its sovereignty, Mexico can freely decide with 
what country to trade," even with third countries outside NAFTA, 
Tello said. 
  The ambassador said Mexican President Carlos Salinas' visit 
to Cuba next week will serve "to underline the deep ties of 
friendship" between the two countries and "the multifarious 
nature of the relationship." 
  Salinas will stay in Havana a little less than six hours, 
the 
ambassador said. "The hours will be few but intense, with 
cordial dialogue between the two delegations," he said. 
  Mexico is the country that holds the most intensive 
relations 
with Cuba in the areas of technological cooperation, education, 
culture, and sports. The two countries hold "important" 
relations in commerce, tourism, and joint investments, Tello 
said. 
  Salinas, the fourth Mexican president to consecutively visit 
Cuba, plans to hold a round of talks with President Fidel 
Castro, the diplomat reported. The signing of a specific 
document is also on the agenda. "Business deals between Mexico 
and Cuba continue at their own pace and rhythm" and are not 
conditioned "by a Salinas visit in this particular instance," 
Tello said. Mexico seeks to "strengthen and improve" the level 
of its relations with Cuba and "explore new forms" of 
cooperation, he said. He said the Mexican Government "is 
determined to strengthen its relations of all types with 
Caribbean countries" and that "Cuba plays a decisive role" in 
this project. 
  The creation of the Association of Caribbean States [AEC], 
in 
which all regional states and territories, including Cuba and 
Mexico, will participate, will be "the first firm step toward a 
policy of commercial rapprochement" in the area. 
  The AEC charter will be signed in Caracas late this month 
during a ministers meeting to prepare the summit of regional 
presidents and heads of state to be held in Barbados on 4 July. 
  With this organization, "the Caribbean will gradually 
participate in the integrationist effort" of the rest of the 
hemisphere, where Mexico participates with free trade treaties 
signed with Canada and the United States, as well as with Costa 
Rica and Chile, Tello said. 
  From Havana, Salinas will fly to Cartagena, where he will 
sign a free trade agreement within the framework of the 
so-called Group of Three with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera. 
  The 23 heads of state and government of Latin America, 
Spain, 
and Portugal will participate in the 4th Ibero-American Summit 
also to be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15 June.

  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina Gonzalez 
concluded an official visit to Qatar on 6 June. The head of 
Cuban diplomacy said in the Qatari capital that the Qatari 
Government decided to establish diplomatic relations with Cuba 
despite foreign pressure. Robaina said that during his visit to 
the Persian Gulf country, negotiations were started for 
cooperation in the health, sports, biology, and medicine sectors. 
  Shortly before stating this in a news conference at Doha, 
Robaina met with Defense Minister Prince Hamad Bin-Khalifah Al 
Thani, to whom he delivered a letter from Cuban President Fidel 
Castro Ruz. The Qatari leader said his government wants to 
maintain independent relations with Cuba based on respect for 
sovereignty. Al Thani also accepted Robaina's invitation to 
visit Havana, adding that he will sponsor the visit of a 
delegation of Qatari businessmen to Havana. 
  Robaina also met with the ministers of foreign affairs, 
health, economy, finance, and trade to analyze the possibilities 
of bilateral cooperation.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro Ruz, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], arrived in Matanzas this 
morning to begin a tour through the territories defended by the 
Central Army. Raul was met upon his arrival at army 
headquarters by Central Army General Joaquin Quintas Solas. 
Immediately after arriving, Raul placed a floral wreath at the 
monument honoring the militia school students who fell during 
the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
  Politburo member Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the party 
in Matanzas, briefed Raul and his delegation on the economic, 
political, and social situation in Matanzas, which sparked a 
debate on topics such as the efforts made in the recovery of the 
agricultural-livestock sector, which is currently faced with 
many difficulties. 
  Colonel Cabrera Valdez, deputy chief of the provincial 
general staff, presented a report on the main areas of the 
provincial staff's work in defending Matanzas Province. 
  On this first day of his tour, Raul stressed the importance 
of the people's defense tunnels and other fortification projects 
which are aimed at defending the population and maintaining the 
vitality of the FAR in case of an aggression against our 
country. With regards to this, Raul expressed his belief that 
Matanzas City, from the work that has been carried out and the 
possibilities that its natural conditions provide, could become 
the first capital city of the provinces to have its entire 
population protected, if it is not beat by Santiago de Cuba. 
Santiago de Cuba is currently making a great effort in that 
area, but Santiago de Cuba has more than 400,000 inhabitants. 
  Raul is accompanied by Commander of the Revolution Juan 
Almeida Bosque; Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first 
vice minister of the FAR and head of the general staff; and 
other high ranking officers.

  [Text] Cuban-American organizations, headed by the 
Cuban-American Committee for Peace, will meet U.S. congressmen 
on 9 June to denounce the U.S. blockade against Cuba. Committee 
President Raymundo del Toro says the meeting is an opportunity 
to support the act of free trade with Cuba, sponsored by New 
York Representative Charles Rangel. Del Toro says it is time 
for the Clinton administration to change U.S. policy toward Cuba 
now that the United States has ratified the most-favored-nation 
status for the PRC and lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam. 
  The Cuban-American Committee for Peace president says 
Clinton 
is associating himself with the reactionary minority of the 
Cuban emigre community, which has made maintaining the economic 
blockade against Cuba a lucrative business. Del Toro also 
predicted that Clinton will, once again, lose the 1996 elections 
in Florida if he maintains ties with that minority group of the 
Cuban emigre community.

  [Text] The implementation of Decree Law 149 against money 
hoarders has begun without much publicity and without wasting 
any time, as a way to ensure that respect for the law and 
citizen coexistence reign in Cuba. 
  According to GRANMA newspaper, the attorney general's office 
has reiterated that Decree Law No. 149 should not be and is not 
intended to be a crusade or witch hunt, but the beginning of a 
practice that should become an everyday affair, a resolution 
with a permanent nature. 
  In principle, it has been demonstrated that the term money 
hoarder does not exempt any part of the population nor that the 
action taken is uncalled for, judging by what has been found. 
There are specific examples that demonstrate this, such as the 
case of the workshop administrator in Guira de Melena, who with 
a salary of 167 pesos per month, was the owner of four boats, a 
motorcycle, a truck, and several household appliances; or of 
another citizen in Pinar del Rio, who had four trucks, two cars, 
two motorcycles, a rice mill, a welding plant, six houses, more 
than 35,000 pesos, and large quantities of automobile parts, 
accessories, and tires. 
  GRANMA newspaper also points out that the provincial 
prosecutors must act according to the methodological 
dispositions and not on whim. The process has been to make an 
inventory of the goods, leave some as a deposit, freeze certain 
assets, and seize others that are stored at an established place 
until the investigation has concluded, and a decision is made 
regarding the case. During this process, other hidden illegal 
activities may be found, including the use of forms to acquire 
profit, and the lack of control that has allowed state resources 
to end up in the hands of these individuals. 
  Decree Law 149 has ceased to represent the money hoarders as 
cases on file. It has become action against those who enjoy a 
lifestyle that exceeds their income.

  [Text] A new legal regulation to improve the labor 
disability report is in effect nationwide following the issuance 
of Resolution No. 52 of the Public Health Ministry [Minsap]. The 
resolution clearly states the great responsibility borne by 
those who are selected to disability panels because their 
decisions are significant in political, economic and social 
terms: first, because their decisions will impact the 
implementation of one of the most significant accomplishments of 
the Revolution, social welfare; second, because it implies 
making retirement payments to disabled workers; third, because 
when a worker leaves the labor force, the impact goes beyond the 
public health sector. 
  These are the bases for the current dispositions of the 
labor 
disability report contained in the new Minsap resolution. It is 
known that prior to this regulation, superficial and even 
fraudulent evaluations were quite frequent. These evaluations 
determined partial, total, or permanent disability status on the 
basis of friendship or bribes, although we do not want to allude 
to the majority of the cases evaluated in the past. The 
determinations issued from now on, however, must consider the 
age, sex, specific work load, risk factors, and physical 
capability of the workers according to the injury in question, 
in order to determine if it is a case of total or permanent 
disability for their current work, or partial or permanent 
disability for other work. 
  The performance of these disability panels will be examined 
periodically and their members will be evaluated annually on the 
fulfillment of their duties. If violations are detected, and 
they have social repercussions detrimental to the prestige of 
the medical practice, the case will be brought to the public 
health minister to determine suspension or banning from medical 
practice.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion": Commentary by Orlando Contreras; from the </F>
"Doing Radio" program] 
  [Text] Information from abroad suggests that the obstinate 
U.S. practice of gambling on and fueling Cuba's collapse loses 
support every day because of its foundation and illegal nature 
and that the longer it takes its supporters to reconsider this 
position, the greater will be their failure. 
  Cuba will soon hold a new round of talks with British 
businessmen, sponsored by THE ECONOMIST. One British analyst 
says that this, among other things, indicates that London gives 
little importance to Washington's claims of an alleged Cuban 
collapse. 
  There is more: Cuban Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal 
confirmed during a brief visit to several European and northern 
countries the success of foreign contract oil exploration 
enterprises that work in Cuba at their own risk. Several 
European sources report that two new agreements have been signed 
in London. 
  Qatar, a small, independent, Persian Gulf country that 
produces a great deal of oil, not only has established 
diplomatic relations with Cuba but also has decided to send 
businessmen to Cuba and to work on mutually beneficial projects 
with our country. 
  The 24th OAS General Assembly has just got underway in 
Belem, 
Brazil. Brazilian President Itamar Franco expressed support for 
the OAS reconsidering its 30-year-old resolution separating Cuba 
from that inter-American organization. Outgoing OAS President 
Joao Baena Soares has also expressed support for this. 
  An important group of Colombian legislators, most of whom 
are 
from the Liberal Party, the current governing party, will send a 
message to the fourth Ibero-American summit, beginning one week 
from today in Cartagena de Indias, demanding the end of the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba. In addition, a group of U.S. 
businessmen, intellectuals, and politicians, together with 
sectors of the Cuban emigre community, will demonstrate against 
the blockade in Washington on 9 June. 
  Other reports state that Russia and Venezuela are 
considering 
the possibility of resuming the supply of oil to Cuba through a 
formula that would save transportation from Russian ports. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will arrive in 
Cuba on an official visit on 13 June. Mexico has always 
maintained relations with our country, relations that remain in 
optimum conditions. 
  These are the facts, not rhetoric, that demonstrate that 
Washington's isolation regarding its anti-Cuban policy increases 
every day.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F>
BOHEMIA magazine with guests Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine and 
Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES newspaper; date not given -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Cuban agriculture and its new formulas: 
I believe we have discussed this issue on other occasions and 
from different angles. For example, one day Eloy and I 
discussed whether or not Cuban soil could feed the Cuban people. 
We discussed the basic cooperative production units and 
criticized some things in the agriculture sector on other 
occasions. Today, I suggest we examine the new formulas for the 
agriculture sector, how they can influence Cuban life and how 
and to what extent they can solve the food problem. Luis, I 
propose that you begin the debate because I see you are eager to 
begin a lengthy dissertation. 
  [Sexto] No, let me tell you that you have put me in a tight 
spot. I respect Eloy a lot because I believe he is a good 
journalist and because the issue of agriculture has been one of 
his constant campaigns. I also know that he is a specialist, an 
agricultural technician. He does not know it, but I know that 
he studied in an agronomy school way back in his youth. In 
fact, I recognize his authority due to his dedication to the 
topic as a journalist and due to his knowledge about the 
agronomy sector. That is why you have put me in a tight spot. 
  [Rodriguez] Alright. You must begin as the youngest man. 
  [Sexto] Alright. I accept if you put it that way. 
Agriculture is a very critical issue. It is very critical 
because it has a direct influence on the population, it is part 
of the people's livelihood. In fact, we currently see that our 
agricultural sector is not fulfilling the people's nutrition 
needs. I might ask: What happens? Is it true that our 
agricultural sector is as inefficient as the empty marketplaces 
show us? Is it true that it has always been that inefficient 
over the last 35 years? We must ask that question. There is 
another question we must ask: Why has there been another 
organization? We have answered this question, but it would not 
be a waste of time to discuss the issue again. 
  I endorse the view that agriculture has not always been a 
failure. I think Cuban agriculture has gone through various 
phases. I think the last 5-year phase has not been the happiest. 
It has not been the happiest because our agriculture suffered 
an overwhelming blow. It was a highly technical agriculture; it 
was an agriculture that relied on machinery, fuel, and chemical 
products, and it practically lost its suppliers of machinery, 
fuel, and chemical products. In Cuban slang, it was an 
agriculture that found itself naked all of a sudden. Therefore, 
right now, at this point, we cannot demand miracles from our 
agriculture, which is striving, seeking solutions, seeking 
solutions and even asking the people to go that extra mile to 
overcome this depressive phase. 
  [Rodriguez] What does Eloy Concepcion think about this? 
  [Concepcion] It is like Luis Sexto says. Now then, there is 
an essential element that I always like to bring up when I talk 
about everything. Our country is dutybound to do what is part 
of the most sacred and beautiful thing that the revolution has, 
meaning the pledge to provide for 11 million people on an equal 
basis. Any analysis must bear this in mind. If we do not make 
that analysis, we will not find the truth. If we did not have 
equal distribution, the analyses would be different and 
production would be easier because we would opt for the 
so-called market economy and the policy of every man for 
himself. Those 11 million people sometimes multiply because we 
have hospitals, schools, the so-called social consumption, and 
the workers' cafeterias, which charge prices that fail to cover 
the costs of the products being offered, etc. etc. Those issues 
must be considered. 
  [Rodriguez] Cuban agriculture and its new formulas: That is 
the issue Luis Sexto, of BOHEMIA magazine, and Eloy Concepcion, 
of TRABAJADORES newspaper, and myself -- Osvaldo Rodriguez, of 
BOHEMIA magazine -- are reviewing in "Straight Talk." Luis 
Sexto is requesting the floor as if we were in a meeting. 
  [Sexto] Osvaldo, we are in a meeting. I want to say that 
many myths have existed regarding Cuban agriculture, above all, 
myths that are curently being used in certain enemy propaganda 
and in certain views within the country because they cannot 
understand what happens in Cuba, what were the basic causes that 
propitiated this situation. That is why they are resorting to 
myths. I want to talk about the myth concerning 
prerevolutionary Cuban agriculture, meaning Cuban agriculture 
prior to the revolution. In fact, it is said... [pauses] A 
scheme of the enemy propaganda states Cuban agriculture produced 
everything for everyone before the revoluution. 
  I believe one-third of the Cuban population was not born 
yesterday; two-thirds were born after 1959. That says a lot 
about the Cuban revolution. One-third was born before 1959. I 
am part of that third, and I have a memory. In addition to 
having a memory, I have eyes to read and delve into my country's 
files. I spend a lot of time delving into my country's files. 
I want to remind those over there -- and some over here -- that 
Cuban agriculture prior to 1959 did not produce everything for 
everyone. I want to state that there was practically no Cuban 
agriculture. I do not think you can talk about agriculture in a 
country that had 9,000 tractors in 1959, a country whose soil 
had almost no chemical fertilizers, a country in which 
irrigation was almost unheard of. 
  I do not think we can talk about agriculture. What 
agriculture are we talking about? 
  Let me give you some figures: A country which imported 63 
percent of its grain could not have agriculture. In other 
words, what do they mean when they claim everything was produced 
for everyone prior to 1959? I also want to add: In 1957, a 
Catholic university group comprised of professionals and 
students who had nothing to do with communism, who had nothing 
to do with the left -- because many of them now live in Miami -- 
published a poll they had conducted in our countryside. They 
proved with figures resulting from careful research that only 2 
percent of the peasants who comprised the rural population in 
Cuba -- 3 million people at the time, 34 percent of the 
population -- ate meat, only 4 percent ate eggs, and only 1 
percent ate fish. In other words, what agriculture do they 
claim existed in the past? 
  Granted, there was the sugar industry. The country also had 
100,000 caballerias of idle land waiting for the time the U.S. 
mills needed them to sow sugarcane. Of course, there was a 
developed sugarcane agriculture with giant companies and 100,000 
caballerias of idle land, whereas 46 percent of the rural 
population was unemployed, all this in 1958. 
  [Concepcion] The sugarcane industry was developed, but the 
sugarcane was cut by hand. 
  [Sexto] Yes, that is right. That was a relative development. 
  [Concepcion] Now more than 80 percent is mechanized. 
  [Sexto] Obviously. That development was relative. That is 
what I was talking about. 
  [Rodriguez] I think that is very important. It is 
appropriate to mention those things. I have discussed this 
issue many times. I believe, however, we must return to the 
topic we mentioned at the beginning of the program and talk 
about today's agriculture. Like you said earlier, you believe 
this agriculture has not always been a failure. I do not 
believe it has been a failure, either. I do not think Cuban 
agriculture today is a failure even. I think plans have failed, 
I think branches of agriculture have failed, and I think other 
branches of agriculture have set a tremendous example. I always 
use the national poultry enterprise and the development achieved 
in the cattle sector, which suffered a setback at a given moment 
but achieved great progress in the genetic and milk production 
sectors, nevertheless, as examples. 
  We are talking about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas. 
Let us talk about the new formulas. 
  [Concepcion] This is what happens, Osvaldo. Many people are 
not aware our agriculture -- edible roots and vegetables -- is 
not only a state enterprise. Many people do not know there are 
105,000 individual peasants who own land in Cuba. Many people 
do not know there are 1,180 agricultural-livestock cooperatives 
[CPA] comprised of peasants who gave their land. Many people do 
not know that the basic cooperative production units have been 
created in the last 6 months. The government has granted the 
workers permanent usufruct of the land, and it has sold them the 
means for production. 
  Also, many people do not know that 92 percent of the garlic 
produced in the country is produced by private landowners rather 
than the state. A total of 58 percent of the tomatoes is also 
produced by the CPAs and individual farmers. The same goes for 
46 percent of the yucca, 54 percent of the sweet potato, and 91 
percent of the carrot. In other words, those are abysmal 
figures. Many times we hear people talk about agriculture, and 
they put all the blame on the state. Well, the state is also to 
blame; logically, it must bear most of the blame because the 
state has been unable to provide enough fertilizer and fuel 
throughout these years. All this sensibly affects the 
agriculture in a tropical country. 
  From what I said at the beginning and with the abrupt 
suspension of supplies from six socialist countries -- on top of 
the blockade, which continues to have a decisive effect on our 
economy -- it would be foolish or evil to think we can solve the 
agrarian products' supply problem overnight or by the grace of 
God. 
  [Sexto] Of course, the creation of the basic cooperative 
production units is the result of the audacious decision adopted 
by the party and the government because they are trying to seek 
formulas which encourage work under these conditions. Our 
country has practically been compelled to render part of its 
80,000 tractors useless. 
  [Rodriguez] Luis Sexto, now that you talk about 
encouragement 
there is an interesting thing: You know that at least 1 million 
workers will join the basic cooperative production units. If 
you multiply this by four, which is the average Cuban family, 
you get 4 million persons. These persons would be directly 
involved in and enjoy the benefits of the basic cooperative 
production units. Also, they would be encouraged by the new 
production formula... [pauses] There is a lot of talk about 
incentives, and I believe there are extraordinary incentives. 
Many of those basic cooperative production units have already 
solved their self-supply problem and have sold edible roots and 
beans to those workers and their families. 
  [Sexto] The measure is very intelligent. The measure will 
yield expected results in the medium or long term. Now then, I 
want to state that our state agriculture, when it had all those 
fuel and fertilizer supplies, meaning the state agriculture 
which some people have always termed as a failure -- I say it 
has not always been a failure -- once produced more milk and 
eggs than a capitalist country. It once produced 50 percent of 
the rice consumed in Cuba, and once it produced citrus as has 
never been done in a capitalist country. 
  [Rodriguez] Undeniably, the topic is far from over. I invite 
you, my friends, to continue this in another "Straight Talk" 
program. Thank you, Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine and Eloy 
Concepcion of TRABAJADORES newspaper for your straight talk 
about Cuban agriculture and its new formulas.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Jun (AFP) -- Talking to reporters 
in Santo Domingo on Tuesday, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio 
Herrera Cabral urged the United Nations to provide a list of 
supplies exempted from the embargo imposed on the Haitian 
military regime in order to avoid a "genocide." 
  Herrera Cabral said that if the absolute blockade is 
maintained along the border between the Dominican Republic and 
Haiti, "an induced and announced genocide" would be fostered. 
The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the Caribbean island of 
Hispaniola. 
  Until recently, food, medicine, and other goods for stores 
and factories flowed from the Dominican Republic into Haiti 
despite the embargo ordered by the United Nations to force the 
ousting of the military and the return of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide who was toppled on 30 September 1991. 
  A systematic contraband supply of gasoline joined those 
"humanitarian" supplies along the Haitian border, prompting 
Washington and the United Nations to pressure Dominican 
President Joaquin Balaguer to make effective the total closure 
of the border posts. Balaguer agreed and since then a military 
cordon along the border strip, measuring 300 km in length, has 
been set established. 
  Herrera Cabral said he discussed the matter with Balaguer 
but 
declined to comment on the outcome of the meeting with the 
president, who is a steadfast opponent of the embargo for fear 
of a massive invasion of Haitians into the Dominican Republic. 
  Reports from the border area indicate that hundreds of 
Haitians living in nearby villages try to cross the border every 
day to obtain supplies in Dominican stores. Until now, the 
Dominican controls along the border have resulted in the death 
of one Haitian at the hands of a Dominican soldier. 
  The deputy foreign minister said UN negotiator Dante Caputo 
promised to provide the Dominican authorities a list of the 
products that may be sent to Haiti, but the Dominican Foreign 
Ministry has yet to receive it. "There is a quantity of food 
ready to be sent to Haiti, and I hope that the matter is 
resolved today or tomorrow," Herrera Cabral stated. The 
official warned that "the time will come when the patience of 
armed soldiers will not let Haitians have an open field because 
that would be dangerous for the country." 
  He concluded by saying he did not know the date of the 
arrival of a mission of UN observers and logistical support, 
including U.S. helicopters, to monitor compliance with the 
embargo along the border.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Police sources 
report that approximately 60,000 Dominicans protested today in 
Cotuy, 140 km northeast of Santo Domingo, against the fraud 
allegedly perpetrated in the 16 May general elections. 
  Several civic organizations in Cotuy called residents to a 
general work stoppage -- the first of several protest actions 
planned by the Dominican opposition and in which more than 50 
percent of the population participated. 
  According to reports, public transportation was scarce and 
only a few stores conducted normal operations during the strike. 
Nevertheless, no serious incidents were reported. 
  Reports of serious irregularities during the elections have 
delayed the proclamation of a new president. 
  Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, presidential candidate of the 
opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party, today threatened to 
call a general strike if current President Joaquin Balaguer is 
proclaimed the winner. 
  Pena Gomez declared: "The illegal proclamation of Balaguer 
would unleash all kinds of protests, including a general strike. 
It would not be necessary, however, to resort to violence. 
Peaceful resistance would suffice." He added, "We will 
paralyze entire cities and provinces." 
  Pena Gomez has repeatedly claimed that the Central Electoral 
Board permitted "a colossal and blatant fraud" in the May 
elections in the Dominican Republic.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 7 Jun (AFP) -- The government of 
provisional Haitian President Emile Jonassaint (not recognized 
by the international community) protested "vigorously" today 
against a statement by U.S. President Bill Clinton that Haiti is 
located in the U.S. "backyard." 
  "Untimely statements such as this violate the cardinal and 
universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that 
govern relations among nations," a communique issued by the 
provisional government pointed out. "The sacred land of Haiti 
is not and will never be the backyard of any other state, not 
even of the world's most powerful," the document added. 
  After reminding that the use of force remains among the U.S. 
options for restoring democracy in Haiti, Clinton pointed out on 
19 May, the United States has "significant interests" in this 
country, which is located "in the backyard" of the United 
States. He also commented on the problem of the Haitian refugees 
and on drug trafficking.

  [Text] In Port-au-Prince, the provisional government 
protested against statements made by President Bill Clinton of 
the United States. The government of Judge Emile Jonassaint 
raised a vigorous protest against President Clinton's recent 
statements, according to which Haiti is located in the United 
States' backyard. 
  Such untimely statements clearly violate the cardinal and 
universal principles of sovereignty and self-determination that 
govern relations among nations, writes the Ministry of 
Information in a press release. The land of Haiti is not and 
will never be the backyard of any state, not even of the world's 
most powerful, continues the government press release which also 
denounces the unspeakable behavior of unnatural sons of the 
homeland who, obsessed with the passion of power, offer the 
country's detractors an opportunity to degrade it.

<F P=106> [Press release by the Jonassaint government responding to </F>
the threat of military intervention in Haiti.] 
  [Text] 1. The provisional Government of the Republic has 
noted with stupefaction the AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE dispatch dated 
3 June in which a Haitian citizen has just demanded a military 
intervention by a foreign power against his country. 
  2. The provisional Government of the Republic is amazed that 
the United Nations charges this government with state 
delinquency by unanimously legalizing this cowardly attack by 
the planet's superpower against the small, independent, 
sovereign Republic of Haiti, still a statuary member of this 
organization. 
  3. In view of this unanimity of international policy in 
favor 
of organized genocide on behalf of anarchy and fanaticism, 
regardless of logic, in defiance of international law, 
regardless even of reason, the Government of the Republic 
believes that it must protest, and as a matter of fact, does 
protest against the military option considered and being closely 
executed by the Navy despite the sane opinion of polite society, 
carrying on regardless of the resolutions of Congress. 
  4. The provisional Government reiterates to all the great 
and 
small powers of the world its deepest feeling of friendship and 
good faith in cooperating with the international community for 
the defense of peace and the promotion of the development of 
nations. 
  5. The provisional Government stresses to all, however, that 
any attack will trigger an automatic reaction of defense, even 
suicide. 
  6. Therefore, the order has been passed to the Haitian Armed 
Forces to remember under these circumstances the strategic 
traditions of the country by taking all proper measures to 
organize civil defense for the benefit of the national 
population. 
  7. The homeland remains above all sacrifice!

  [Text] Here is our opinion. A second 1915 is threatening 
the country. What must we do? When the U.S. Marines landed in 
Haiti on 28 July 1915, most Haitians in the cities refused to 
understand. They were always sounding bugles, shouting freedom 
or death. They were always swearing that they would not let 
foreigners take the country of Dessalines again. But 
unfortunately, words are something and the decisions we make are 
something else. On 28 July 1915, there were Haitians who were 
impatiently awaiting the Americans . 
  As in 1915, so it is today in 1994. That is 79 years of 
humiliation, mourning, torture against inhabitants in both the 
cities and the countryside. The dirty Haitian bourgeoisie has 
joined with a coarse, criminal Army to annihilate all the 
Haitian people and to help the Americans land again -- to weigh 
us down even more within the logic of the coup d'etat and the 
protection the Americans have sworn to provide as a reward to 
all the criminals who helped it stage the coup d'etat. There 
were Haitians who welcomed the Yankees in 1915 because they 
would bring industry, and consequently, the country's economy 
would progress. 
  Today, in 1994, considering the U.S. plan for the Caribbean 
region within the framework of the New World Order, will the 
Americans be bringing industries and progress? If we closely 
examine what is going on today, we will realize that the Haitian 
situation is a real headache for the U.S. Government. Haiti is 
one of the most problematic countries in the region. Imperialism 
took many chances with all its previous governments, before the 
government of Titide Aristide. Nothing ever worked. All the 
money that was invested in development projects to prepare Haiti 
to enter the New World Order has vanished because most of that 
money was misused by dictators while the country remains 
underdeveloped despite the fact that the Americans felt they 
could cooperate with those outdated, bloodthirsty, and 
dictatorial governments that were previously in power in Haiti. 
  Regarding Aristide, despite all the mistakes his government 
might have made, President Titide appeared as one of the most 
honest governments that ever led the country. But the Americans 
did not agree with this government's social project. So they 
dismissed it. It therefore looks more necessary for the United 
States to stage another military intervention in order to 
integrate the country into the framework of the New World Order, 
but without President Aristide. We are not talking about the 
[words indistinct] the 1915 seashore businessmen who always 
pretended to love Haitians, but who were always sucking the 
people's blood for advantages from foreign countries, their home 
countries. 
  All these things show how forgetful we are. Why should we 
believe the United States would like us more than this Army of 
zenglendos and the bourgeoisie? Why would the United States be 
interested in coming to help us in 1994 when we consider that it 
prevented us from seeing the color of true democracy, which the 
entire Haitian people wanted to establish through the 16 
December 1990 elections? What would prompt the United States, 
which refused to acknowledge our independence until the year 
1895, to try to remove us from the sufferings we are 
experiencing now in 1994? If Haitians today think that another 
U.S. intervention will help us, it is also because we have tried 
to become conscious so we can really feel what is going on now 
in our little country. 
  As early as 1898, during the war between Cuba and Spain, the 
U.S. Government began a gruesome game in the Caribbean Sea. 
Marines landed for the slightest reason. Americans were 
conquering. Cuba, Panama, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic 
were under their law. They were all being kicked. They were all 
working hard for the well-being of U.S. people, for the 
advantages of U.S. imperialism. Even recently, in the year 1990, 
after the Cold War period, after the disappearance of the 
eastern bloc, the Americans landed in Iraq and killed people to 
defend their own interests. Besides, what would prevent them 
from doing that because they are king everywhere, they are the 
policeman of the world. Despite all this and all that we do not 
say, we do not understand why we refuse to be cautious. We will 
end this talk here for today. Let us think, because once again, 
our lives are threatened.

  [Text] Meanwhile, hunger, fear, and despair are common 
occurrences in the border area between Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic, where local authorities are still waiting for 
instructions to authorize the crossing of humanitarian aid, the 
only aid allowed since the UN Security Council ordered the total 
embargo against the Haitian junta on 21 May. Thus, in Dajabon, a 
city located in the north of the Dominican Republic, the 
district retains $20,000 of humanitarian aid out of the $40,000 
collected by the national Catholic Church. The problem here is 
that there is no one, there is no one [repeats] who has civil, 
military, or international authority, Father Regimo Martinez 
complains. 
  While in Port-au-Prince the effects of the embargo have 
begun 
to be felt, the situation at the border is desperate. It is one 
of the poorest areas of Haiti. In the villages close to the 
Dominican Republic, cities like Dajabon in the north of the 
country and Jimani in the south, some Haitians manage to elude 
the vigilance of the Dominican border guards to obtain something 
to eat, even though it is often dried pieces of cake or simple 
pieces of bread. 
  In Villa Anacaona, the last border post before the road 
enters Haitian territory, the military and security services 
control the vehicles to make sure they do not carry anything 
into Haiti. On a road through Haitian territory, children are 
seen desperately pursuing the rare vehicles that pass, begging 
for food. The children hurry down the hills to ask for food or 
money, with their hands on their stomachs to show that they are 
hungry. They all live in small huts with straw roofs, but 
without walls, on the 50 km of the nearly impassable road. At 
the approach to the Dominican Republic, there are a few 
Dominican workers repairing the road. In this area, there are 
four Dominican surveillance posts, each comprising two soldiers 
who are sent for eight days. 
  One of the extremities on the way to its highest point is 
Pedro Santana, a poor village on Dominican territory, whose 
inhabitants sit in the doorways of their houses, commenting on 
the events of the day while sipping a beer.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 7 June. 
  The Mexican economy grew slightly in the first quarter with 
the GDP increasing 0.5 percent over the same period in 1993. 
Nevertheless, for thousands of Mexican companies and their 
employees, the recession that began in 1993 continued. This was 
particularly true in the service subsectors of trade, 
restaurants, and hotels. The recession in the service sector 
has lasted longer than in the other areas of the economy. The 
last time this sector showed growth was in the first quarter of 
1993, when it registered an annual growth rate of 2.2 percent. 
(Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 
GMT 2 Jun 94) 
  CORPAMEX [Mexican Employers Confederation] President Antonio 
Sanchez Diaz de Rivera told UNOMASUNO yesterday that economic 
growth has been "delayed" and that its reactivation will not be 
seen until 1995. In a news conference, Diaz proposed that new 
family businesses be exempt from all types of taxes and a 3 
percent cap be placed on sales taxes. According to Diaz, these 
measures will allow "groups in the underground economy to pass 
into the formal economy, and this will prevent the unemployment 
problem from worsening." (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 1 Jun 
94 pp 1, 19) 
  The under secretary of trade has said NAFTA is "progressing 
very well," adding that proof of this is that manufacturing 
exports in the first quarter rose 25.4 percent over the same 
period last year. The under secretary also announced that a free 
trade agreement will be signed among the G-3 nations -- 
Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela -- during the upcoming 
Ibero-American presidential summit in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia. The official also said the free trade agreement 
signed with Costa Rica has paved the way for negotiations with 
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 2024 GMT 2 Jun 94) 
  The Bancomer Financial Group has announced that the lifting 
of trade barriers and lagging technology have had an adverse 
effect on the Mexican textile industry, even though in the 
long-run this could be the one of the sectors to benefit most 
from NAFTA. The Bancomer Group forecasts a 3.9 percent increase 
in the GDP this year, but only a 2.1 percent increase in the 
garment industry's gross product. Problems faced by the industry 
include a lack of integration in terms of production, a shortage 
of raw materials, low quality, limited designs, and high 
financing costs. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 17) 
  A poll conducted by the Secretariat of Commerce and 
Industrial Development (SECOFI) among industrialists, asking 
whether it should move to expedite the liberalization of trade 
barriers on some products listed under NAFTA, has met with a 
very poor response, while most respondents announced their 
opposition to the expediting of liberalization. The industrial 
sectors voicing the greatest opposition were those that produce 
glass, wine, household appliances, pharmaceuticals, heavy 
machinery, and chemicals. Meanwhile, industries in favor of 
speeding up the lifting of trade barriers were those that 
produce shoes, textiles, citrus fruits, flowers, and tropical 
fruits. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 49) 
  The president of the National Agrarian Council has said 
problems still remain six months after NAFTA's implementation, 
particularly in terms of customs and the overall understanding 
of the trilateral agreement's terminology. The president noted 
that the majority of producers in this sector have expressed 
their opposition to speeding up the lifting of tariffs. 
Nevertheless, it was reported that the sector grew 7 percent in 
the first quarter, mainly because of strong exports of coffee 
and cattle. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 52) 
  The governments of Mexico and the UK yesterday signed an 
agreement on tax issues. The agreement is aimed at averting 
double taxation and tax evasion on income and capital gains. 
The agreement seeks to eliminate excessive taxes resulting in 
double taxation on investments and capital flow between the two 
nations. The agreement also makes it easier for tax authorities 
from both nations to exchange information to combat fraud and 
tax evasion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 14) 
  Japanese businessmen said during a meeting with President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari that Japanese companies in the 
electric, banking, automobile, heavy machinery, construction, 
and food industries are interested in investing in Mexico in 
light of the nation's secure economic future. Among the 
companies interested in investing are: Bank of Tokyo, Honda 
Motors, Canon Ltd., Sanyo, Nissan, Clarion, Aoki Corp., Marubeni 
Corp., and Terumo. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0333 GMT 1 
Jun 94) 
  Yesterday, Mexican Petroleum [PEMEX] announced a 25-50 cent 
increase in the per-barrel price of petroleum as of 1 June for 
oil sales to the Americas, Europe, and the Far East. The 
measure is designed to keep Mexican crude aligned with prices on 
the international market. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 1 
Jun 94 p 18) 
  PEMEX Gas Company and Basic Petrochemical Company -- PEMEX 
subsidiaries -- showed a 444 million new peso gross profit for 
the first quarter of 1994. In a press release, state-owned 
PEMEX reported that with larger revenues mainly from sales and a 
reduction in expenditures, the operation and investment budget 
showed a 570 million new peso surplus as opposed to the budgeted 
deficit of about 110 million new pesos. (Mexico City LA JORNADA 
in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 48) 
  SECOFI will apply, as of Saturday, a retaliatory quota of 
45.74 percent on beef imports from the EU. SECOFI also reported 
that an "antidumping" investigation has been initiated into beef 
imports from the United States. The retaliatory quota was 
imposed on meat from the EU after it was confirmed that European 
nations still subsidize this sector. If the investigations into 
the U.S. imports demonstrate questionable trade practices, a 
retaliatory quota will also be imposed on these imports. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1651 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  The public sector, banking sector, and private industry's 
increase in contracting net international debts has prompted 
considerable growth in Mexico's overall foreign debt in the 
first quarter. According to SECOFI and the Bank of Mexico, 
foreign debt reached an all-time high in March at $119.179 
billion. That is 6.7 percent higher than accumulated debt 
recorded in December 1993. Most foreign funds were used to 
finance export projects, as well as small and medium-sized 
businesses. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 3A) 
  During 1993, private foreign debt increased by $10.791 
billion, of which 67.8 percent was incurred by the nonfinancial 
sector and 32.2 percent by the banking sector. After the 
renegotiation of government liabilities in 1990, the placing of 
bonds and securities became the main foreign financing tool for 
a total of $5.285 billion in 1993. Of this total, 73.6 percent 
corresponds to 44 emissions by nonbanking firms and 26.4 percent 
to six emissions by the banking sector. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 pp 1, 10) 
  SECOFI confirmed that in the first 1994 quarter, 19 percent 
of the 41.4 billion new pesos earmarked for public investments 
in 1994 had already been invested in public agencies and 
corporations. The total investment budget was increased by 
7.324 billion new pesos to include investments in the National 
Solidarity program. The Group of Economists and Associates 
indicated that for the first time in several years public 
savings was not enough to finance public investments. (Mexico 
City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 7)

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored through 7 
Jun. 
  Addressing a meeting of presidents from the Central American 
Chambers of Commerce, Economy Minister Luis Enrique Cordova on 2 
June warned that if equitable treatment is not guaranteed in 
free trade negotiations, there is a risk that investments will 
be diverted away from Central America. The meeting is being 
held before negotiations for a free trade treaty with Mexico to 
review the private sector's role in the negotiations. (San 
Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  The Central Bank reported on 3 June that economic activity 
in 
El Salvador increased 7.1 percent during the first three months 
of 1994. The increase was primarily attributed to the "dynamic" 
output of the industrial and construction sectors. The 1994 
monetary program is designed to achieve overall economic growth 
of 5-6 percent. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2113 GMT 3 Jun 94)

<F P=106> [Speech by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio marking the 6 </F>
June anniversary of his first year in office; place and date not 
given -- recorded] 
  [Text] People of Guatemala: 6 June marks my first year in 
the presidency and the anniversary of a commitment I made to 
you. This commitment, which is based on a number of principles, 
remains valid. I want to report that progress has been achieved 
during this period. 
  Despite major obstacles in the political, economic, and 
social realms, we have taken historic steps I would like to 
stress, because our government -- although we consider ourselves 
to be a transition government -- has not been idle but has 
tackled the country's most serious problems. Although this 
government does not plan to resolve all of these problems, it 
does plan to establish foundations for new structures in 
Guatemala. 
  In the realm of politics, our goal is to consolidate 
democracy and the de jure state. Fulfilling this goal is 
undoubtedly among one of the achievements of this government -- 
namely, the preservation and strengthening of our institutions 
within the framework of the law. 
  The Guatemalan Army is aware of its role within a democracy, 
and it has supported the government and its institutions. 
Therefore, it also has supported the democratic process. 
  The purging process stems from this effort to preserve and 
strengthen the government. It started in the executive branch 
itself. We fired officials who had supported a break in 
constitutional order and those who had been involved in 
corruption. Despite adverse conditions -- conditions of which 
all Guatemalans are aware -- we managed to conduct a popular 
consultation that allowed us to begin implementing viable 
constitutional reforms. 
  As a result, we will have a new Congress of the Republic and 
a new Supreme Court of Justice through legislative elections -- 
that is, through legal and peaceful means. The Guatemalan 
people wanted the renewal of the Congress, and we are renewing 
it, perhaps through the least popular means at this time but, 
nevertheless, the most solid and positive means in the long-term. 
  Constitutional reforms have already yielded results. We have 
a new independent prosecutor general and attorney general. We 
have banned the transfer of budgetary funds within the 
government. Confidential expenditures have been absolutely 
abolished. This makes the administrative-financial process more 
honest. A deputy was removed for the first time in history as 
the result of reforms of pretrial procedures. 
  As for our efforts in seeking peace, our progress is more 
than significant. One year ago, this process was at a complete 
standstill. We now have a commission specifically tasked with 
achieving peace, and we have presented to the Guatemalan people 
a national negotiation-based peace plan which is designed to end 
armed confrontation. This plan is based on the establishment of 
a permanent forum for peace and national reconciliation, and 
moreover, it is based on governmental efforts to meet the social 
demands of the people -- namely, the struggle against poverty. 
  On 29 March 1994, we signed with the URNG [Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity] an agreement on a timetable for 
negotiations to attain resolute and lasting peace in Guatemala. 
It reaffirms the commitment of both parties to signing a peace 
agreement in 1994. We also signed a comprehensive human rights 
agreement that allowed a mission tasked with verifying human 
rights to visit the country for the first time in May 1994. 
This will lead to the installation of the International 
Verification Commission, which will be done as soon as possible. 
  Within this framework, over the past 12 months we have been 
able to guarantee the return of 4,830 Guatemalans, who represent 
1,014 households, by instituting the Labor Reinsertion Fund 
[Fondo de Reinsercion Laboral] with an initial working capital 
of 14 million quetzals, as well as by establishing the National 
Indigenous Fund and appointing its Board of Directors. 
  Now, one year after I entered office, the peace process has 
progressed to such an extent that the signing of an agreement 
for a firm and lasting peace has never been so near at hand -- 
an agreement that will make it possible to put an end to armed 
confrontation and successfully combat poverty in Guatemala. 
  In terms of public security, because of the rise in 
violence, 
we implemented an emergency plan which is supported by the 
Guatemalan Armed Forces and which encourages greater efficiency 
in the National Police and Finance Police. This program is 
starting to show results in curbing kidnappings, preventing auto 
theft, and in the struggle against drug trafficking. This has 
resulted in greater security for the people. 
  In terms of economic matters, restraint and honesty 
represent 
this administration's fundamental principles. Moreover, even 
though corruption has not been abolished, it is evident that the 
Guatemalan people are convinced they have a president who is 
here to govern and not to get rich or to conduct business deals. 
  The Guatemalan people are aware of the conditions under 
which 
I assumed control of the country. The treasury was depleted, 
and there was debt everywhere. Despite the problems we have 
faced in the political realm, our administration has been able 
to preserve economic stability. We were able to control 
inflation to such an extent that it totaled 11.2 percent in 
1993. This is much lower than the 14.2 percent registered in 
1992. Moreover, it has been forecast that inflation will not 
exceed 10 percent in 1994. 
  In part, price stability has been created by improved 
coordination of monetary and fiscal policy. This is evident in 
the performance of the Bank of Guatemala [Banguat] credit to the 
central government, which has decreased over the past 12 months 
by nearly 474 million quetzals. 
  By ensuring stability in foreign exchange, it has been 
possible to make the exchange system more flexible. Banguat's 
external debt was reduced by $173 million over the past 12 
months, and international monetary reserves now total $801 
million. 
  In terms of fiscal issues, the government is directing its 
efforts at reorganizing and sustaining public finances. 
Restraint, honesty, and openness have allowed us to reassign 
public funds to priority items, thereby supporting public 
investments. In an unprecedented event, we have been able to 
implement nearly 1.280 billion quetzals worth of public 
investments, which represent 77 percent of all planned 
investments. Our accomplishments are quite significant in terms 
of the past performance of government investments, which over 
the past decades never exceeded 50 percent of budgetary targets 
in any one year. Nevertheless, despite initial problems in 
redirecting efforts while establishing priorities within the 
government's current agenda, and despite the difficult financial 
situation, this administration has been able to implement 67 
percent [figure as heard] of its planned investments over the 
past 12 months. To all of this we must add 562 million quetzals 
administered by decentralized agencies. All of this has allowed 
us to implement 997 projects, which include 12,006 secondary 
projects, many of which are being carried out in the country's 
far-flung regions with the support of and efforts from many 
communities in the rural areas. 
  In the institutional sphere, and as result of the public 
workers strike, a Government Restructuring and Wage Policy 
Commission was created and tasked with advancing the 
modernization of the executive branch. We have continued to 
make progress with our institutional modernization policy, which 
ultimately will allow the government to improve the efficiency 
of the services it offers through a process of concessions and 
demonopolization. We are working within a legal framework, 
which the administration has made transparent to all sectors. 
Nevertheless, as tangible proof of these actions, we are 
restructuring the electricity subsector. [Word indistinct] is 
ready for privatization. 
  In terms of economics and support for investments, we have 
signed the Guatemala Protocol, which modifies and perfects the 
Federal Treaty of Central American Economic Integration. We 
currently hold the temporary secretariat of the Central American 
integration process, and we have made important progress within 
the framework of GATT, as well as in the offer by the U.S. 
Government regarding the possibility of the region's joining 
NAFTA. 
  The efforts under way are keeping open the possibility of 
our 
gaining access to the same advantages Mexico will obtain from 
NAFTA, while we negotiate the region's full inclusion into the 
treaty. 
  In the international field, we must stress the defense of 
the 
rights of Guatemala in the case of Belize, having obtained the 
latter party's recognition of the existence of a dispute. 
  In the social sphere, I must underscore that our 
achievements 
in the area of investment are the result of economic and 
administrative decentralization, which has been possible because 
we have promoted a culture of social participation. In this 
process, important roles have been played by the Development 
Councils which, at the same time, have managed to set up the 
Community Development Solidarity Fund. Another special 
instrument for development is the National Peace Fund. Through 
these two funds alone, we have executed projects worth 238 
million quetzals in the poorest areas of the country. 
  We have distributed to the municipalities 368 million 
quetzals in accordance with the 8 percent of the budget 
stipulated by the Constitution. This has been done directly, 
during visits I have made to 150 of the country's poorest and 
remotest municipalities and villages. 
  All of the aforementioned actions have allowed, improved, 
and 
expanded social supervision; in other words, they have fostered 
direct and participatory actions by the communities. 
  People of Guatemala: We are working with a new style of 
government and with a positive and constructive attitude, 
despite the difficulties we have encountered. We are 
approaching our problems with intensity, without losing 
ourselves in short-term views despite the provisional nature of 
our administration. This government thanks the Guatemalan 
people for their expressed confidence, which has been proved by 
recent polls that show the president with a 76 percent approval 
rating. 
  Before I conclude, I must tell you that I just returned from 
a trip to Peten. I was accompanied by my wife, top government 
officials, civilian and military authorities, and, in 
particular, by Costa Rican President Figueres. Today, 295 
projects were simultaneously inaugurated throughout the country 
at a cost of 52 million quetzals. These projects will benefit 
between 1.7 million and 2 million Guatemalans. I would have 
liked to have inaugurated all of these projects, but I preferred 
to do so in a very remote, poor, and needy village -- in Ixbobo 
village in San Luis, Peten, where we held a lovely ceremony and 
where the Costa Rican president and I, with great satisfaction, 
symbolically cut the ribbons that inaugurated all of the 
projects I have mentioned. In this way, we are combating 
poverty, attempting to eradicate violence, and raising the 
standard of living of all Guatemalans. 
  In conclusion, I must tell you, people of Guatemala, that I 
have a commitment to all of you. I am working and will continue 
to work to leave for the next government a country that will be 
in a different state than the one I found it in. Nevertheless, 
we must keep in mind that the creation of a different Guatemala 
is a task for all Guatemalans. We must adopt an attitude of 
solidarity and progressiveness that will allow us to build a 
country in which peace and social equality will prevail. Thank 
you very much.

  [Text] DIDE [Information and Press Department of the Army] 
spokewoman Berta Edith Vargas has said, that according to the 
defense minister, gunrunning into Guatemala is a serious and 
complex problem the Army intends to solve. 
  She has said that, despite the special efforts of several 
government institutions, the Army must deal with the extensive 
border across which arms and all types of goods are smuggled in; 
for this reason, it is impossible to have complete control, 
although civilian and military authorities do everything 
possible. 
  Asked as to whether this problem could lead to a crisis at a 
time when the URNG [National Guatemalan Revolutionary Unity] is 
disarmed and disbanded, she has said the Army could not predict 
whether this situation would occur. She has recalled, however, 
that El Salvador experienced a great deal of problems once 
peace was signed due to the large number of arms that had 
remained in the country. 
  She has said these problems are not expected to appear in 
Guatemala, because a large number of arms have been seized in 
Puebla, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Guatemala City. We know, 
however, that they possess a considerable number of arms and 
that they even sell arms illegally to the people to make a 
profit. As to whether these arms will end up directly in the 
hands of common criminals, she said the rebels have many of them 
and do with them whatever they pleas. She again recalled the 
Salvadoran case, where this did indeed occur. 
  Vargas has said the Army, once peace is signed, expects more 
moves of common sense from the rebels regarding arms, thus 
showing their willingness to live in peace by taking those arms 
out of the Guatemalan market. 
  She has said the government's Peace Commission, where the 
Army is represented, deals with aspects related to arms control, 
an issue which, in addition to a military advisory role, will 
surely be included on an agenda.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  The Guatemalan Congress has refrained from approving the 
renegotiation of the country's debt with the Paris Club. This 
decision places the country in a precarious position and could 
even close the doors to future international loans. Guatemalan 
Christian Democracy and Solidarity Action Movement deputies 
blocked a proposal in favor of the renegotiation. (Guatemala 
City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 79) 
  The Central Bank of Guatemala has reported that between 
January and May 1994 the country's foreign exchange income rose 
by 18.7 percent. The country's foreign trade contributed 
greatly to this increase. Sales of traditional products 
increased 26.5 percent, despite declines in cotton and banana 
sales. Meanwhile, sales of nontraditional products increased 
14.4 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0256 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  Finance Minister Ana Ordonez has reported that during the 
first trimester of the year, Guatemala's fiscal deficit 
increased by some $52.2 million. The minister said the fact 
that taxpayers failed to pay taxes on time contributed to the 
shortfall. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 1841 GMT 3 Jun 94)

  [Text] Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias 
will say goodbye to Taiwanese Prime Minister Lien Chan, who is 
on a four-day official visit to this country, at the Guatemalan 
Air Force Headquarters this morning. 
  During his stay, Prime Minister Chan held a number of 
meetings with the presidents of the three government branches 
and was bestowed a number of medals, including the Order of 
Quetzal. 
  Diplomatic sources have said the prime minister's visit 
strengthened the ties of cooperation and friendship between the 
two countries. 
  Before his departure today, Chan offered to support 
President 
Ramiro de Leon's efforts to rebuild the country with investments 
as soon as a final peace agreement is signed with the guerrillas. 
  The official believes Guatemala will enter a stage of 
reconstruction by ending the armed conflict, which began in 
1960, and become a country that will attract Oriental investors. 
  Lien Chan also expressed his "respect for the good thoughts" 
the Guatemalan president has to rebuild the country before and 
after the signing of the peace agreement, which is scheduled for 
December 1994. 
  According to the offer, Taiwan will join the countries that 
will support projects of reconstruction and development, which 
will allow the consolidation of peace. Meanwhile, Lien Chan is 
carrying President de Leon's promise to support Taiwan's effort 
to be admitted as an OAS observer.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Carlos Roberto Reina with an </F>
unidentified moderator and unidentified reporters at a hotel in 
Tegucigalpa on 6 June--recorded] 
  [Text] [Reina] International organizations have finally and 
firmly acknowledged this government's social commitment. There 
have been very auspicious indications, and the government is 
committed to honoring its campaign promises. We find this very 
auspicious, because it is something the whole world is 
witnessing as a reaffirmation of the social role of the 
administration over which I am honored to preside. If you have 
any questions, I am more than willing to answer. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] in the short run, how can we 
end such a situation in our country? 
  [Reina] I reiterate, we are undertaking enormous efforts, 
not 
only through international organizations but also through the 
National Social Welfare Board, as well as through other agencies 
involved in issues of child care. Numerous nongovernment 
organizations, the prestigious NGO's, are encouraged to 
cooperate in this endeavor. The number of children involved is 
quite significant, but I hope that by the end of my 
administration, we will have been able to demonstrate the social 
progress accomplished in this issue. 
  [Reporter] Guillermo Molina Chocano, Secplan [Secretariat of 
Planning, Coordination, and Budget] minister, said a few minutes 
ago that the letter of intent will be signed shortly and that 
the elimination of subsidies to the transportation system is 
practically inevitable; likewise, he mentioned the situation of 
the groups involved in the distribution of crude oil. In this 
case, he was referring to fuel rationing. 
  [Reina] I would like all of you to be aware of the enormous 
problems we are confronting. It is up to me to confront 
poverty, corruption, and the crisis, in addition to tremendous 
misunderstandings such as certain statements I heard this 
morning. If one does not have support from the media and the 
people, everything becomes more difficult. I am not about to 
waver in this struggle, but I need allies, and I hope I can rely 
on all good-hearted Hondurans. 
  The letter of intent will be signed, and the details will be 
disclosed in due time. If we break with the international 
organizations, we would be greatly harming Honduras. You have 
just mentioned a classic example. 
  If we allow distributors to fix fuel prices, prices will 
increase almost every day. If we stop them here and now, they 
will deprive the market of fuel. What do we do then? We would 
have no fuel, and we would continue to receive criticism from 
both sides. What has to be done is what is more convenient to 
the country, and that is exactly what we are doing; we are doing 
this with the individuals we believe are the most capable. On 
several occasions I have said I have chosen the most capable 
Hondurans as my advisers; after all, the art of governing is 
also knowing when to surround oneself with competent advisers. 
  [Reporter] But, Mr. President, when are we going to witness 
those concrete decisions? The country is going through a 
tremendous chaos. We have an energy crisis and a crude oil 
crisis; in addition, the price of the family basket is 
constantly rising. When is your administration going to take 
concrete decisions? During your last presidential address you 
announced you would earmark 100 million lempiras for BANASUPRO 
[National Supply Agency for Basic Products], which has not yet 
come through. Then we have the issue of the closed fishing 
season, and the forests, and [words indistinct]. 
  [Reina] The first concrete answer is the moral revolution. 
Every government official is under supervision. Is this or is 
this not the main answer? All government officials are under 
investigation. Why was this not done before? Because 
conditions were not given. What the people want to know are the 
measures; nonetheless, I can give you a very precise answer. We 
are going to create a consensus for these measures to be 
accepted by all. If we do it before the consensus is ensured, 
the undermined parties will turn on us. To govern is a very 
serious and difficult affair. 
  [Reporter] But decisions must be taken in light of the 
numerous conflict of interests.... 
  [Reina, interrupting] Honduras has progressed more during 
the 
first 100 days of my administration than during anytime in its 
history. 
  I think this is what must be emphasized, not negative 
things. You are right, I have a program with specific measures, 
and I am examining it to gain the support of all the sectors. 
This week I will hold some meetings. This past weekend I also 
held meetings to present the specific measures. You shall see 
that the affected persons will react. You have seen the 
reactions we get every time we have said that the National 
Enterprise for Electric Power [ENEE] will raise the fees of 
clients who spend more than 300 kilowatts! The same is true for 
oil distributors. The people think that it is just a matter of 
making decisions. 
  First one must have the moral authority and be a legitimate 
government. When you say this is chaos, do you really believe 
this is chaos? 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Reina] This is a difficult crisis, but this government is 
legitimate and prestigious. Do you think Vice President Gore's 
visit to Honduras just happened? Do you think it is just a 
coincidence that the president of Honduras will be one of the 
important figures to attend the Cartagena de Indias Summit and 
the Miami summit? This is not chaos! This is a crisis, a 
crisis we inherited. This country has been looted on many 
occasions. My task is to rehabilitate the country and to turn 
it over in much better condition. We do not have to use terms 
that create much alarm; we must use appropriate terminology. 
When are we going to have specific measures? We are discussing 
them with the country's various sectors to gain general 
acceptance. Following the moral revolution, I proposed a 
convergence. We are planning to produce that convergence in 
four months. I am sure that the important sectors will accept 
it and support it. 
  [Reporter] Some business sectors are already visibly 
desperate. [Honduran Chamber of Commerce President] Eduardo 
Facusse said in El Salvador, where he recently participated in a 
meeting of presidents of chambers of commerce, that the Honduran 
Government not only does not get started, it is also undecided. 
I interpreted this reference to a crisis as a reference to your 
leadership of the country. How do you respond to this? 
  [Reina] It is absurd to put in doubt the people's mandate. 
No one is above the people, and the people gave me a mandate. 
Any questioning of this mandate means betraying the people. It 
is like saying: I am above that mandate. What happens is that 
some people use inappropriate terms, and this is what makes the 
news. The deputies issued a letter containing three 
inappropriate words, and those words were the news. Mr. Facusse 
has spoken in favor of the government on many occasions, but he 
makes the news the moment he utters this statement, which in my 
opinion was unwise, about the country not having a guide, about 
hesitation. How does he know this? He represents some 
interests, and the interests of that sector do not represent the 
interests of the entire country. He would like for me to have 
accepted the 10 percent-on-sales proposal from the very 
beginning. I am not going to do it. 
  [Reporter] Are you upset over of what he said? 
  [Reina] No, no, no. I do not want to get involved in any 
argument with individuals who are my friends. I am simply 
explaining in general terms how inadequate it is to use certain 
terms. 
  Today a man who I believe is in Congress, said things in 
favor of seizing the government, as if this would resolve 
everything. This is simple-minded, a vulgarity. I am not going 
to continue using terms to describe this person. 
  [Reporter] Who are you talking about, Mr. President? 
  [Reina] About any person who uses terms that go against a 
legitimate government, against a president who deserves the 
respect of the Honduran people, a president who has national and 
international moral authority. When anyone makes a caustic 
remark against him, this is news, this is the source of 
commentaries and of questions. I think this shows a lack of 
maturity. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you spoke about the country having 
been plundered. The people want to know who did the plundering, 
now that you have used this term. They want to see the looters 
in prison. Another question: The teachers want a 100-percent 
salary increase. This could become a trend and other labor 
unions could make similar demands. 
  [Reina] Three things: The people know the names of the 
persons who have plundered this country. Right now there are 
legal structures for announcing those names soon. I assure you 
that soon a dozen names will be made known to you. Documents 
are being investigated. There is no reason to rush things and 
become impatient. 
  About teachers wanting a 100-percent salary increase, I 
think 
they could be somewhat correct in doing so. The problem is: 
From where are we going to get 800 million lempiras to give 
them this increase? The matter is being negotiated sensibly, 
quietly, and very capably. The negotiators are seeking equity 
to give teachers a reasonable increase within the government's 
possibilities. 
  Regarding the last part of your question, we are about to 
announce a salary increase that I think is fair, and not only 
the minimum salary will be increased. 
  This is part of the national consensus. Everything is on 
the path toward improving this country. Everything is on the 
path that indicates the respect Honduras has acquired in the 
international community will be advantageous to our people. I 
will never fail my people. 
  [Reporter] Good morning. As for the current energy crisis, 
it is said your government has been negligent to a certain 
extent, especially in light of the Canadian atomic plant and the 
Chinese plant. 
  [Reina] There are two separate issues here: Canada and the 
atomic plant. Do you know what it would mean to build a nuclear 
plant in Honduras? Those who have criticized me have no idea of 
what they are saying. What would we do with the toxic waste? 
Would we send it to the poor people of Honduras, as was the 
case when industrialized nations wanted to send us toxic waste? 
They wanted to send us toxic waste to finish poisoning us. 
Where are the technicians to build this atomic plant? My name 
always appears in the newspapers linked to all kinds of 
ridiculous things. 
  [Reporter] What about the Chinese plant? 
  [Reina] As for the Chinese plant, bringing one from China 
would cost a fortune and would take too long. 
  [Reporter] And Mexico? 
  [Reina] A plant is already coming from Mexico, and I have 
already thanked the Mexican president. Two plants are coming. 
We are wisely and carefully facing these problems. The 
impatience... [pauses] these hesitations are not hesitations. I 
have no doubts whatsoever that I am doing the right thing. 
Should I have any doubts, I would hesitate. 
  [Reporter] Is it possible to negotiate with China to have 
China finance the shipment of the plant, because the Chinese are 
willing to donate it to us? 
  [Reina] I believe it is negotiable. However, our country 
must find its own solutions. There are many countries that are 
willing to assist us, and capable people are reviewing this 
assistance. I am about to review the membership of certain 
commissions to guarantee their efficiency. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] was already covered? 
  [Reina] This is a question that I [words indistinct] part of 
the measures we are going to take. We cannot continue to 
appraise the value of the dollar. We can no longer accept high 
levels of inflation, which must be controlled, because this is 
the worst tax levied on the poor people of Honduras. These are 
the measures I will announce at an important news conference I 
will hold in the near future. 
  [Reporter] How soon? 
  [Reina] Be patient. 
  [Reporter] That is very kind of you, Mr. President. 
  [Reina] [words indistinct] 
  [Moderator] This concludes President Reina's news 
conference. 
  [Reporter] Could you ask President Reina what he thinks 
about 
the statements by Byron Suazo, La Paz Department Liberal deputy, 
who has charged Jorge Arturo Reina is doing nothing for this 
government? Suazo maintains that Jorge Reina only goes to the 
National Congress to collect his paycheck, and he also questions 
the moral revolution, which he has called the mortal revolution. 
Suazo says only friends and relatives of the Reina family are 
reaping benefits. He also has claimed that the country is on 
its way to anarchy, because the current administration is only 
helping its friends and relatives. 
  [Reina] I give you my word that these charges are false, but 
I do enjoy Suazo's comments. 
  [Reporter] The media today reported that your environment 
minister has personally benefited by placing the Environment 
Ministry in a building he owns. 
  [Reina] This happened in the previous administration. He 
requested my permission to remain there -- in a building that 
meets all requirements. I gave him my permission. 
  [Reporter] How do you view Suazo's remarks on the moral 
revolution? 
  [Reina] He belongs to another party. There can be no 
complicity, because the contract for the building is valid. 
  [Moderator] [words indistinct] The president has said he 
will answer no more questions.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Honduran economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  Finance Minister Juan Ferrera has announced that to fulfill 
the international financial organizations' requirement to reduce 
the fiscal deficit from 11 percent to 5 percent, the government 
still needs to make an adjustment of some 1.5 billion lempiras. 
Meanwhile, Minister Ferrera explained that the Honduran 
Government will not eliminate subsidies on transportation or on 
the price of kerosene. (Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO DE HONDURAS in 
Spanish 31 May 94 p 11) 
  The government collected 1 billion lempiras in taxes in the 
first five months of the year, according to Deputy Finance 
Minister Ramiro Lozano Landa. He added that tax revenues were 
300 million lempiras higher than in the same period in 1993. 
Nevertheless, Lozano Landa pointed out that the increased 
revenues still need to be accompanied by a 10 percent reduction 
in government spending, as recently noted by Hugo Neo Pino, 
president of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). (San Pedro Sula 
TIEMPO in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 6) 
  According to a report issued by the Economic Studies 
Department of the BCH, inflation reached 12.7 percent in the 
first five months of the year. The BCH report added that, if 
the growth rate continues at its current pace, the government 
will not be able to meet its goal of an 18-percent rate of 
inflation by the end of 1994. (Tegucigalpa LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 
3 Jun 94 p 13)

  [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (DPA) -- An undetermined number of 
former soldiers, who were once assigned to the Government 
Ministry, decided to take over the Managua Cathedral this 
afternoon (local) after approximately 40 former servicemen had 
decided to peacefully occupy the Venezuelan Embassy to demand 
social and economic assistance. 
  The double occupation by the former servicemen and former 
Nicaraguan resistance members, aimed at demanding the 
distribution of land for the building of homes and other 
assistance, prompted the police to assume positions near the 
scene of the events. 
  The police arrested nearly 10 people who participated in the 
brief occupation of the Managua Cathedral. 
  The police are searching the area near the cathedral, which 
is located near Managua's heavily used eastern highway. Deputy 
Commander Pedro Aguilar, head of the Public Security Police, 
told reporters the deployment of troops had been carried out in 
order to guarantee "security." 
  Other police officers stated they were awaiting orders and 
had not breached the embassy grounds where the retired former 
servicemen are. 
  At least six Venezuelan diplomats are reportedly still 
inside 
the diplomatic mission. 
  It is possible Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant could be 
negotiating, given he is aware of the demands being made by the 
former servicemen, who claim they belong to the Movement for a 
Just and Honorable Compensation [Movimiento Pro Indemnizacion 
Digna y Justa]. This group contends that for the past years it 
has been demanding retirement benefits from the Chamorro 
government.

  [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government has announced that the 23 former Sandinist soldiers 
who occupied the Venezuelan Embassy in Managua today are unarmed 
and that there have been no violent incidents thus far. 
  Managua radio stations announced the former soldiers, who 
worked at the Nicaraguan Government Ministry, occupied the 
embassy to protest the Chamorro administration's failure to 
fulfill the agreements signed for their rejoining civilian life. 
  Meanwhile, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has disclosed the 
occupiers are "a small group of demobilized soldiers who are 
dissatisfied with the facilities offered to them" by the 
Chamorro administration. 
  The former soldiers have taken as hostages Venezuelan 
Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant, four other diplomats, three 
Nicaraguan secretaries, and the custodial staff. 
  According to the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry, Ambassador 
Monsant has already spoken via telephone with Edmundo Castillo, 
general secretary of the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry, whom he 
informed there is an atmosphere of calm despite the occupation. 
  Meanwhile, a Nicaraguan Government Ministry spokesman told 
ACAN- EFE the authorities of this security and public order 
institution "are studying the situation." 
  "We do not have any official information thus far regarding 
the occupiers' requests" the source added. 
  Meanwhile, a contingent of riot police have cordoned off the 
area surrounding the embassy, which has been occupied since 1430 
local (2030 GMT) today. 
  Another group of former Sandinist soldiers occupied Managua 
Cathedral shortly after the action at the Venezuelan Embassy was 
confirmed. A police detachment was deployed to the embassy, and 
no incidents have been reported. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2329 GMT on 7 June reports the 
Venezuelan Foreign Ministry has contacted Ambassador Monsant. 
According to a ministry spokesman, "Monsant, who is being held 
hostage with First Secretary Guider Salazar and approximately 
five administrative staff members, is safe, because the former 
soldiers are unarmed." The spokesman adds all of the hostages 
are safe. According to the report, the occupiers are dressed in 
civilian clothes and are wearing masks, as are the 30 
individuals who occupied the cathedral.)

  [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Nicaraguan 
Government today rejected demands made by two groups of former 
soldiers who peacefully and simultaneously occupied the Managua 
Cathedral and the Venezuelan Embassy in the same city. 
  According to Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar, the two 
groups of former soldiers -- members of the Movement for Fair 
Compensation -- "are demanding compensation that is not due 
them." 
  The occupiers of both sites -- approximately 22 people at 
the 
Cathedral and a similar number at the embassy -- were Government 
Ministry employees. 
  "These are people who had asked for compensation, but were 
only entitled to severance pay" when they left active service, 
Cesar stressed. Cesar noted that during past Cathedral 
occupations -- in October 1993 and February 1994 -- an agreement 
was reached with 705 former members of this same group, under 
which they were to receive severance pay in accordance with the 
law, but, he added, only 587 former soldiers had received 
payment so far. 
  The deputy minister also said that appropriate measures will 
be taken if the occupants, whose leaders were negotiating this 
evening with human rights organizations and Venezuelan 
Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant, maintain their current position. 
  "We will act in accordance with the country's laws, because 
the situation is deplorable," [words indistinct] added that the 
embassy would have to give permission if the building were to be 
evacuated by force. 
  Cesar reported that there are four diplomatic officials 
being 
held along with the ambassador, following the voluntary release 
of two members of the embassy staff. At the Cathedral an 
undetermined number of nuns are being held. 
  The official did not deny the possibility that "people 
trying 
to create an atmosphere of instability" were behind these 
incidents. Based on this he asked the occupants to reconsider 
their actions and surrender. 
  Monsant, meanwhile, told the media this afternoon that he 
hoped the situation could be resolved within a few hours.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Nicaraguan economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  The value of the country's exports in the first half of the 
year grew 8 percent when compared to export revenues obtained 
during the same period last year, according to Nicaraguan 
economic authorities. (Paris AFP in Spanish 0001 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  The Nicaraguan Central Bank (BCN) has announced that in line 
with the BCN's policy of monthly 1 percent devaluations, the 
corboba has lost 5 percent of its value in relation to the U.S. 
dollar over the past five months. The official exchange rate is 
now 6.65 cordobas to the dollar, and, if the rate of devaluation 
continues unchanged, the exchange rate will be 7.12 cordobas to 
the dollar by the end of the year. Up until April, the overall 
rate of inflation was 2.41 percent. The authorities forecast 
the inflation rate will increase to 10 percent by the end of the 
year. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1903 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  The BCN has announced that in the first five months of 1994, 
the overall rate of inflation was at 3.38 percent. (Panama City 
ACAN in Spanish 2156 GMT 6 Jun 94) 
  The BCN Board of Directors decided on 3 June to lower the 
discount rate from 11.75 percent to 11.10 percent, BCN President 
Taboada told BARRICADA. He added that this reduction will lower 
by 1 percent those loans used to finance most of the nation's 
production activities. (Managua BARRICADA in Spanish 3 Jun 94 pp 
1, 5) 
  BCN President Jose Evenor Taboada has announced that coins 
for five, 10, 25, and 50 centavos will begin to circulate in the 
country on Friday, 3 June. He noted that the coins, which are 
worth a total of $10 million, were minted in Mexico. (Managua 
Radio Nicaragua Network in Spanish 1200 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  Over the past four years, the World Food Program has donated 
$10 million to domestic food programs, such as the School Food 
Program, the Autonomous Atlantic Region Socioeconomic 
Rehabilitation Program, and the Milk Development Program.

  [Text] Nicaragua will receive more than $10 million from 
the German Government as part of two important agreements signed 
on 3 June at the Foreign Cooperation Ministry. 
  The two agreements, signed by Nicaraguan Foreign Cooperation 
Minister Erwin Kruger Maltez and German Ambassador to Nicaragua 
Helmut Schieps, establish that $1.2 million will be in donations 
and $9.1 million in loans. 
  The first agreement, dubbed the "Fund for Research and 
Specialists II," is for $1.2 million consisting of funding for 
reports and secondary research, as well as for assessment in 
preparing documentation for projects involving German 
cooperation. 
  The second agreement, dubbed the "Emergency Fund for Social 
Investments II," is aimed at offsetting the negative effects of 
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, ESAF, by taking 
special steps to modify the social infrastructure. This 
agreement will generate a large amount of manual labor and 
proffers to comply with the criteria of the creation of jobs and 
alleviation of poverty. 
  Carlos Noguera, of the Emergency Fund for Social Investments 
(FISE), was present at the signing of the agreements and said 
these funds would triple the number of projects throughout the 
country.

<F P=106> [By Carlos Camarena Medina] </F>
  [Text] Panama City, 6 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Panamanian 
President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares said today "certain 
sacrifices" will be necessary to modernize the economy, and he 
said joining GATT is "unpostponable." 
  During a meeting with the Association of Panamanian 
Industrialists, one of the country's leading organizations, 
Perez Balladares maintained that opening and modernizing the 
economy must occur without "jolt" or "shock" measures, which 
could have "unpredictable" social ramifications. 
  "We are not planning to use disguised subsidies or 
indefinite 
protective tariffs to motivate the private sector; much less 
will we advocate excessive interference in its business 
activities," he said. 
  He pledged to review those laws that discourage foreign 
investment, including the Labor Code, and those that regulate 
protection of the industrial sector, "because no legal 
instrument is engraved in stone, not even the Constitution." 
  Perez Balladares said the opening of the market will not be 
"synonymous with a lack of protection and will not constitute a 
letter of marque for unfair competition." The opening of the 
market should not be confused "with ambiguous rules of the game 
or a tolerance of smuggling." 
  Perez Balladares added businessmen will have to assume a 
large part of responsibility for the future of the country's 
economy, but they will also reap the most benefits due to the 
broad markets they will find. 
  He added that in light of the prevailing globalization and 
rapid economic changes, the industrial sector will have to make 
adjustments in order "to be up with the times and able to 
compete in the international market." 
  Perez Balladares said the private sector will be responsible 
for generating jobs while the government will have to provide 
the country with adequate infrastructures that will enable the 
normal development of industries. 
  Perez Balladares said if the costs that depend on government 
legislation are not more arduous than those of other countries, 
"there is no reason for the country not to be able to compete in 
the international market in a relatively short time." 
  As for Panama joining GATT, Perez Balladares said that his 
administration "will not allow any unnecessary delay or 
whimsical haste" and that negotiations will continue to 
integrate the interests of all productive sectors. 
  He conceded that, although the final decisions will not 
satisfy everyone, "those who disagree will be in the minority." 
Regardless, all sectors will be consulted so as to minimize any 
adverse effects resulting "from this significant and 
unpostponable move Panama must make." 
  Perez Balladares believes the "primitive and parochial" idea 
of paternalizing government works must be abandoned, and he 
urged private sector involvement in the construction of highways 
and the improvement, widening, and management of ports. 
  The economic crisis the country is facing, he explained, 
goes 
hand in hand with the education crisis. There is no point in 
creating jobs if there are no qualified workers; conversely, it 
would be discouraging to have skilled workers if no jobs are 
available. 
  In this regard, Perez Balladares urged private sector 
involvement in the process of educational reform and the 
training of labor, which will benefit industries in the future. 
  According to Perez Balladares, the political integration 
advocated by Simon Bolivar "is a utopia," but economic 
integration in small or large blocs "is indispensable for 
development." 
  Redefining Panamanian delegations abroad to promote the 
country's potential and publicize its advantages in close 
cooperation with local businessmen is among his government's 
priorities in attracting new foreign investment. 
  He said security is vital for attracting foreign investment; 
consequently, "as a priority" he will professionalize the police 
force, "but without the jolt of having military control in 
public matters."

  [Text] President Guillermo Endara Galimany today, utilizing 
his constitutional powers, pardoned a number of individuals 
accused of allegedly committing political crimes. 
  Among those pardoned are former President Eric Arturo 
Delvalle and the 510 corregimiento representatives who appointed 
Francisco Rodriguez as president for the presidential term that 
started on 1 September 1989. Also included in this pardon 
granted to those who committed only political crimes are 
Benjamin Colamarco Patino; Arturo Diez; Rafael Arosemena; 
Orville K. Goodin; Olmedo David Miranda; Nander Pitty Velasquez; 
Jorge Eduardo Ritter; Marta Amado Trevia; Manuel Solis Palma; 
Francisco Sanchez Cardenas; Julio Shaik; and Jaime Simmons. 
  Meanwhile, Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque, who allegedly 
slandered and offended Omayra Correa by publishing three 
political cartoons in LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA in August and 
September 1989, was also granted a pardon. Others who were 
granted presidential pardons include journalists Escolastico 
Calvo and Guillermo Keevers. 
  These pardons fail to absolve these people from being 
prosecuted for committing common crimes, however.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  Eduardo Linares, deputy minister of planning and economic 
policy, has reported that international financial institutes 
(IFI's) could "withhold approximately $300 million in credits if 
the government fails to comply with various stringent conditions 
imposed by these organizations." He added, "There would be a 
$1.9 million deficit in 1994 budget if this money is withheld." 
The government is expected to make several modifications to the 
national budget to prevent the IFI's decision from negatively 
affecting the budget. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas, Finance 
Minister Victor Juliao, and Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria 
are scheduled to meet on 6 June to discuss the issue. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 1A) 
  A report issued by the Economic Commission for Latin America 
shows that the Central American region registered an economic 
growth rate of more than 4 percent in 1993, "which has generated 
a moderate increase in the domestic GNP of each nation of the 
region for the second year in a row." The report adds that 
Central America "advanced in its goal of controlling inflation, 
which in Costa Rica decreased from 17 percent to 9 percent, and 
in Guatemala from 14 percent to 12 percent. In Honduras and 
Nicaragua, however, inflation increased to 15 percent and 25 
percent, respectively." Although Panama has not formally joined 
the Central American region, its GNP increased 5.9 percent while 
unemployment declined to 13.9 percent in 1993. (Panama City EL 
PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 4B) 
  According to a press release issued by the Israeli Embassy 
in 
Panama: "Israeli exports enjoyed a successful year in 1993. 
Israel's international sales increased 11 percent, while in 
Latin America, they rose 22 percent." Meanwhile, the increase 
in Israeli exports to Panama was even higher, growing some 52 
percent in just one year. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in 
Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 4B)

  [Text] Bahia Blanca Federal Judge Alcindo Alvarez Canale 
confirmed that the Federal Police and other security 
organizations can -- with a court order -- break into 
clandestine radio stations. 
  The case originated in a previous decision ordering a raid 
on 
and seizure of the transmitters of the General San Martin FM 
radio station, which was operating illegally. 
  The station owner filed a petition to annul the decision 
saying that the station's activity could not be classified as a 
crime or even an "administrative violation," and questioning the 
Federal Police's authority to seize the transmitters. 
  Judge Alvarez Canale said the seizure "is perfectly 
admissible in our legislation and does not violate any 
constitutional guarantees." The judge also said that Decree No. 
332/89 authorizes not only the Federal Police but also all 
security organizations, if they have a federal court order, to 
close stations, lower antennas, or seize the equipment used by 
clandestine stations. 
  The National Telecommunications Commission (CNT) with 
Federal 
Police support closed five clandestine FM radio stations in 
Chubut, four in Trelew, and one in Madryn. 
  So far the Federal Committee for Broadcasting (Confer) has 
closed and seized the transmitting equipment of more than 800 
radio and television stations throughout the country.

Workers], leader of the Front of State Workers Unions [Frente de 
Gremios Estatales], headed a march in San Salvador de Jujuy 
today to protest a decree establishing a 150 percent salary 
increase for government officials. 
  The combative trade union leader described the provincial 
government's decision as "a slap in the face of the people of 
Jujuy" because workers' wages are way below those earned by 
government officials. 
  The mobilization, involving about 2,000 people, began at 
about 1130 after representatives from various trade union 
organizations held meetings at their respective headquarters and 
then marched without incident to Belgrano Square in downtown San 
Salvador de Jujuy. 
  The SEOM unionist was joined by former Zapla Blast Furnace 
workers, retirees, Cederm (Secondary Education Center) members, 
ADEP (Association of Provincial Teachers) members, and APUAP 
(Association of Public Administration University Professionals) 
members, among others. 
  Santillan noted that the salary increase for government 
officials "is unconstitutional" because according to the 
provincial constitution "the ministers' salaries must be 
established by law." 
  Santillan added: "We, the trade unions, therefore went to 
Belgrano Square. We want the decree to be abolished, or an 
authorization for an equal increase for state workers." 
  The trade union leader stressed that "there was an excessive 
increase -- even for municipal officials -- that reached about 
200 percent." He asked for "a little respect and justice for 
the workers." 
  Santillan indicated that it is contradictory for these 
gentlemen to approve such an increase in Jujuy, "where there is 
malnutrition and infant mortality, school desertion, and the 
worst crisis in history." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Jun (NA) -- Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo today emphasized that the trade balance deficit 
"is not worrisome," and he based his opinion on the fact that 
"the strength of investments and the increase in productivity 
that this causes must be taken into account." 
  The minister said the trade imbalance will create "pressure 
from many sectors for us to stop imports," but he made it clear 
that the government will not back down from its policy of 
opening up. "An increase in exports is the only way to overcome 
the deficit," the minister said. "In view of the pressure that 
will be applied we are going to act with great impartiality." 
  The minister made these remarks during a ceremony in which 
he 
installed Elias Baracat, the new director of the National 
Foreign Trade Commission. This new commission was created to 
study and follow the behavior of international markets. 
  Cavallo explained that within this framework, the commission 
will have to be prepared "to evaluate unfair competition or 
dumping [preceding word in English] that could appear in our 
trade and to adopt the necessary measures to make the GATT 
agreements prevail." 
  In this respect, he stated that the new commission must play 
"an important role," and he made it clear that "if it is 
necessary to apply any type of restrictions it will be to 
counterbalance subsidies or dumping [preceding word in English], 
but always within the framework of the international agreements 
on trade issues signed by Argentina." 
  It has been reported that Baracat will work under Economy 
Vice Minister Carlos Sanchez through the Trade and Investment 
Secretariat. 
  "With this commission we have created a foreign trade 
organization that is in line with the countries that have been 
successful in this sector of the economy," Cavallo said.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 7 Jun (NA) -- Daniel Brunella, 
president of the Chamber of Exporters, today admitted his 
concern over the fact that during the first 4 months of the year 
exports grew by only 4 percent, and demanded "very urgent and 
concrete" measures to achieve a significant increase in sales 
abroad. 
  The businessman believes that an increase in imports cannot 
be avoided because they are caused by the overall growth of the 
economy, but he considers that it is necessary to adopt measures 
so that the government "can achieve the highly touted objective 
of increasing exports." 
  The trade deficit amounted to $2.404 billion during the 
first 
4 months of the year, 378 percent greater than in the same 
period in 1993. 
  Brunella maintained that financing exports, and granting 
loans with an interest rate equal to that in competitor 
countries, are the problems that have to be resolved. 
  Finally, the businessman indicated that "the labor laws must 
be modified to create new job sources and achieve once and for 
all an efficient system of temporary admission."

  [Text] Cordoba (Argentina), 7 Jun (EFE) -- It was reported 
today that the U.S. company Lockheed is studying the possibility 
of establishing a plant in the Argentine province of Cordoba to 
repair military aircraft. 
  Lockheed will this month sign a contract with officials in 
Buenos Aires to modernize the 36 "Skyhawk A-4M" aircraft that 
Argentina purchased from the United States for about $200 
million. 
  According to the letter of intent that was signed, half of 
the aircraft will be reconditioned in the Military Aircraft 
Factory (FAMA) of Cordoba, 800 km northwest of Buenos Aires, 
under the supervision of U.S. technicians. 
  The rest of the aircraft will be reconditioned at Lockheed 
plants in the United States, so that half of the work will be 
completed by late 1995. 
  Cordoba Industry Minister Jose Porta said that the U.S. 
company intends to enter into a joint venture with FAMA, which 
belongs to the Argentine military-industrial complex, to repair 
other types of aircraft like the "Hercules C-130" transport 
aircraft. 
  Porta pointed out that the U.S. company's proposal includes 
the repair and maintenance of commercial aircraft. 
  Argentine authorities will give a response within the next 
few days.

  [Text] The new U.S. ambassador to Brazil will take over his 
post with a long list of pending items on his agenda. Strictly 
political matters have already been overcome, but many items 
remain in the commercial area that must be taken care of lest 
they deteriorate and acquire undesirable tones. Ambassador 
Melvyn Levitsky comes with the good disposition of cooperating 
to find solutions to pending commercial problems, and nothing 
indicates that he intends to take overly harsh positions. He 
should find the same open spirit in Brasilia. 
  However, two questions will demand the ambassador's and the 
Foreign Ministry's best efforts to permit the evolution of 
bilateral relations to continue unhindered. The first item 
involves the issue of telecommunications, a market the United 
States wants to see open to international bidding. The U.S. 
position could, in principle, be advantageous for Brazilian 
telecommunications service consumers due to the price reduction 
that more competition and the exposure to international markets 
would provoke internally. The problem is that telecommunications 
was established as a monopoly in the Constitution, and the 
removal of this obstacle was left for last and then made 
impossible by the failure of the constitutional revision 
process. As of last week, constitutional reforms will be 
possible only with a privileged quorum of three-fifths of all 
legislators' votes, and it will be useless to bring the issue 
back to the fore during this legislature. Only next year, after 
the new deputies and senators are installed, can Congress be 
sounded again on this necessary change for the country's 
modernization. 
  The second issue is more pressing. The Brazilian Government 
promised Washington to have Congress approve a bill on 
intellectual property rights by 15 June. The government and 
Foreign Ministry were unable to push the issue in the Senate 
with the needed speed. Besides, the bill had to be adapted to 
new GATT rules and even if the Senate passes the bill in time, 
which seems unlikely, it can only become law after the Chamber 
of Deputies reexamines it. 
  The 15 June deadline will not be met. The U.S. Government 
then can, if it does not consider Brasilia's efforts to provide 
the country with legislation on property rights reasonable, 
apply sanctions on Brazilian foreign trade. This is something 
that must be prevented at all cost. Congress has its own 
problems, such as the mid-year recess and the electoral 
campaign. But a concentrated effort can be made, as of August, 
to vote on appropriate legislation quickly. And we should expect 
Ambassador Melvyn Levitsky to use all his influence to prevent 
Brazil and the United States from getting involved in some 
serious conflict.

  [Excerpts] The Brazilian Army is reequipping its units with 
Russian and U.S. materiel. On 30 May, the Army Ministry Materiel 
Department chief signed a contract with Russian Government 
representatives in Brasilia for the acquisition of "more than 
100 ground-to-air" rockets to shoot down low-flying planes and 
helicopters. General Gilberto Serra, head of the Army Social 
Communications Center (Cecomsex), said: "The purchase of this 
sort of materiel had been contemplated in our plans." [passage 
omitted] 
  Gen. Serra added that the new equipment will be distributed 
among the different Army units. The Russians will train the 
military in using missiles here in Brazil. The general commented 
that the Brazilian defense policy is "dissuasive," but the 
country must be ready for possible attacks. This is the first 
time Brazil has bought materiel from Russia.

Tocantins State to Santos, Sao Paulo State, was arrested. 
Colombian Vicentino Junior had spent two days hiding in the 
forest along the Tocantins River's banks. 
  Federal Police now are investigating the gang's links with 
international drug trafficking. The group is believed to be a 
Brazilian branch of the Cali cartel. 
  The eight Brazilians and three Colombians arrested during 
the

  [Text] An eventual government led by Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva will be unable to renegotiate the foreign debt agreement 
as stated in the program of the PT [Workers Party] candidate. 
  In the clauses signed by Brazil and its international 
creditors, the Brazilian Government is unable to break or modify 
the repayment contracts. The agreement was signed in April. 
  Under the terms of the agreement, guarantees cover 68 
percent 
of the debt. This is equivalent to $23.8 billion of the $35 
billion that was negotiated. In practice, this amount is 
already in the hands of creditors. 
  The guarantees are in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds that 
were deposited to the name of creditors at the BIS (the Bank of 
International Settlements, in Switzerland, which operates like a 
central bank of central banks around the world). 
  Eduardo Suplicy, the PT senator for Sao Paulo who is a party 
spokesmen for foreign debt affairs, has admitted that 
renegotiating the debt will require the approval of creditors. 
  Suplicy explained that the PT government will try to 
"persuade" international bankers. "We will show them a plan 
against misery, for which we will need a reduction in payments." 
  The party program states: "If creditors remain intransigent, 
the PT government will suspend interest payments" (a moratorium). 
  If this happens, creditors may take the guarantees at an 
earlier date. If interest is paid normally, the bonds will be 
withdrawn in 2024. 
  The debt agreement falls under New York law, which allows 
creditors to obtain compensation if Brazil fails to make 
payments. 
  The PT program has still another obstacle: The current 
foreign debt agreement was approved by the Senate, which will 
have to approve other agreements. 
  Brazil has tried to renegotiate its foreign debt since 1983. 
If complied with, the most recent agreement will normalize 
Brazilian international relations. 
  The foreign debt was the most controversial subject during 
the PT National Meeting on 30 April and 1 May, which designed 
the program of government. 
  Suplicy believes Brazil will be unable to achieve 
development 
under the terms of the agreement signed in April. He said the 
first action by Lula's government in connection with the debt 
will be to ask creditors to negotiate. 
  The total debt amounts to $135.4 billion. The $35 billion 
portion that was negotiated in April was reduced, the interest 
was also reduced, and the repayment term was extended. The $35 
billion portion dropped to $32.5 billion. 
  This reduction was also caused by the fact that the Dart 
family, a U.S. family to whom Brazil owes $1.4 billion, did not 
join the agreement.

  [Text] President Cesar Gaviria bid the Armed Forces 
farewell yesterday during a ceremony marking the 87th 
anniversary of the Jose Maria Cordoba Military School for 
Cadets. During the ceremony, the Army promoted 140 new officers. 
  Gaviria said in his speech "this ceremony holds a special 
meaning for me, as it is the last chance I will have to address 
you and share a moment such as this. Through the School for 
Cadets we honor the Armed Forces as the guardians of democracy 
and human rights." 
  The president briefly summarized the government's strategy 
for strengthening the public forces and justice system. He said 
new recourses, such as the new constitutional guarantee 
procedure [tutela] and others recently put into effect by the 
Prosecutor General's Office and the People's Prosecutor 
[Defensoria del Pueblo] demonstrate the government's pro-human 
rights efforts. 
  "Application of international humanitarian law, as expressed 
specifically in the Constitution, and the country's resulting 
obligation to abide by such laws are other encouraging signs in 
the quest for respect for human rights." 
  Gaviria said the two stages of the government's national 
strategy against violence have sought to strengthen justice, 
fight impunity, and pave the way for democratic participation. 
  "Of course, the high crime rate," Gaviria said, "the degree 
of impunity, and the current level of poverty are factors that 
worry the community in general, especially the government." 
  The president concluded by praising the Armed Forces and 
their individual commanders for their work during the elections 
on 29 May.

Fernando Millan to act in coordination with the Huila Department 
governor's office in providing assistance to persons left 
homeless by the earthquake and the Paez River flooding. Gen. 
Guzman authorized the use of three Army helicopters to evacuate 
civilians and bring in food and medicines. Sixth Brigade 
Commander General Luis Bernardo Urbina Sanchez and 4th Division 
Chief General Carlos Julio Gil Colorado received similar 
instructions to cope with the situation caused by the flooding 
of the Ariari River. 
  The government asked families hurt by yesterday's 
earthquakes 
not to return to their damaged homes until experts conduct 
technical inspections. The risk exists the Paez River in Cauca 
Department may overflow, so residents must take all the 
necessary precautions.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Colombian economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  The Agriculture and Livestock Marketing Institute has 
announced that it will buy the entire rice crop of 45,000 tons 
in Ariari, Meta Department, where the Guillermo Leon Valencia 
Bridge collapsed, leaving the area cut off from the rest of the 
nation. It is possible that the government might also purchase 
the corn crop. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Canal A 
Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 31 May 94) 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics [DANE] 
has reported that inflation reached 1.53 percent in May, adding 
that for the first five months of the year, overall inflation is 
running at 13.65 percent. DANE statistics indicate that the May 
inflation rate was driven higher in part by rent increases. 
Pasto was the most expensive city, while Monteria was the least 
expensive in the same month. (Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision

traffic on the northern stretch of the Pan-American Highway 
blocking one of the main roads at the height of [name 
indistinct] and Cotopaxi, 100 km from Quito. 
  The bill approved on Friday by Congress proposes modifying 
the agrarian reforms to increase production in the nation's 
farming fields. Now, only President Sixto Duran-Ballen's 
approval is required for the bill to become law. The Indian 
Communities, however, have threatened to block roads and isolate 
Quito if the president approves the draft bill. We are not 
willing to accept this aggression, said an Indian leader. We 
have not been taken into account. They think they can do as they 
please behind our backs; we will show them how the people react, 
he said. 
  A leader of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of 
Ecuador [Conaie] told REUTER NEWS AGENCY, that the blocking of 
the roads today is only a first step of a series of measures to 
be taken, if the president of the Republic ratifies the draft 
bill. 
  In our noon newscast we had reported the position of several 
Indian organizations, particularly those of Imbabura, Pichincha, 
Tungurahua, Cotopaxi, and Chimborazo. 
  A government spokesman indicated that Duran-Ballen could 
make 
a decision on the issue in a few hours. The bill is very similar 
to another reform bill presented by the government that was 
recently rejected by the Congress, after a series of protests by 
Indians associations that considered it detrimental to their 
interests. 
  The Social Christian Party drafted the current bill, 
indicating it is fairer than the previous bill but also seeks to 
encourage better use of land to increase farming production. 
Nevertheless, the bill has been questioned by every sector, 
arguing it is a copy of the previous one with some changes that 
are merely cosmetic, with no real changes. The draft bill 
presented by Conaie to the Congress, has not been discussed. 
According to several Indian groups, the reform draft bill wipes 
out the Agrarian Reform's gains and authorizes the government to 
confiscate lands currently in Indian hands and to turn them over 
to rich land owners. 
  Vicente Chato, Indian leader of Tungurahua, indicated that 
Conaie and other Indian associations will meet tomorrow to 
decide on the measure to be taken. They seek to pressure the 
government to put aside its intention of eliminating the 
Agrarian Reform. 
  Traditionally, the Indian protests in our nation have been 
characterized by the closing of highways and occasional 
confrontations with the police without reaching excessive levels 
of violence. This weekend in Chimborazo Province it was reported 
that some Indians groups had met somewhat secretly to decide on 
measures on the agrarian bill approved last week.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Ecuadoran economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  Juan Jose Illingworth, director of the National Institute of 
Statistics and Census, reported on 30 May that the monthly 
consumer price index for Ecuador's urban area dropped to 1.38 
percent in May compared to 3 percent in April. He added that the 
accumulated index for the past 12 months stands at 26.9 percent. 
(Paris AFP in Spanish 0148 GMT 31 May 94) 
  Guillermo Ortega, director of the National Banana Program, 
has confirmed that the restrictions imposed by the EU on Latin 
American banana exports have not yet affected Ecuador, because 
such measures will first be fully implemented on 1 July. In 
fact, Ecuador increased its volume of banana exports by 25.8 
percent and revenues by 24 percent during the first trimester of 
1994 compared to the same period in 1993. (Madrid EFE in Spanish

  [Text] According to Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia, 
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's much-anticipated trip to the 
Chaco region -- in his capacity as commander in chief--to 
inspect the administrative and operational situation of military 
units in the area was not possible because the president was 
afflicted by a strong flu. 
  However, the highest-ranking military commanders and Defense 
Ministry officials went ahead with the tour on Wasmosy's agenda. 
  With the president missing, the attention fell on General 
Lino Oviedo, who briefed the other generals on work to improve 
conditions in Chaco barracks. 
  The delegation included Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia; 
Anibal Pangrazio, director of the National Commission for the 
Development of the Chaco Region; Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez 
Petit, military forces commander; Division General Pedro C. 
Ocampos, chief of the General Staff; Division General Jose 
Cespedes Zarza, Air Force commander; and Vice Admiral Flavio 
Abadie, national Navy commander. 
  During a meeting with reporters, Gen. Oviedo, who was 
accused 
in the past few days by his own fellow political party members 
of acting in partisan politics and of supporting the candidacy 
of Atilio R. Fernandez for the presidency of the ANR [National 
Republican Association--Colorado Party], said those who accuse 
him must present proof of his alleged participation in politics. 
  Oviedo said he has nothing to do with Colorado Party 
presidential hopefuls and reiterated that those who accuse him 
must present proof of what they allege. 
  He said in a well-prepared conciliatory tone that he had 
nothing against officialist Deputy Luis Becker, who last weekend 
accused him of protecting criminals and corrupt individuals. 
  Oviedo also said he did not have anything against Juan 
Carlos 
Galaverna, the other presidential hopeful, who accused him of 
participating in a political meeting at Paul Sarubbi's private 
residence on 1 June that also was attended by Atilio R. 
Fernandez and urban transportation entrepreneurs who allegedly 
committed their buses to transport Atilio R. Fernandez 
supporters.

  [Text] Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of 
Ministers and foreign minister, said yesterday that the 
preliminary report of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights 
Committee (CIDH), which recognizes the violation of ex-President 
Alan Garcia Perez's human rights, has no juridical effect and 
that this organization lacks any jurisdiction. 
  He harshly questioned the leaking of the preliminary report 
which he said is a "confidential" report. 
  Goldenberg expressed annoyance over the CIDH report which 
adds that Peru violated the guarantees of an adequate process in 
the case of Alan Garcia. 
  He said the judicial proceedings against Garcia for illegal 
enrichment and for the illegal possession of weapons will 
continue "because this investigation is completely independent 
of the matters discussed by the CIDH which has no power to make 
decisions or issue rulings." 
  He said the Peruvian Government has a term in which to 
implement appropriate actions, adding that the committee could 
even decide to shelf the case. 
  Goldenberg several times denied that the committee's 
preliminary report was a warning of the unstable Peruvian 
juridical system. 
  Regarding the release of the report in Washington, 
Goldenberg 
accused the head of the CIDH executive secretariat of unduly 
releasing the report. 
  He added that the diplomatic protest was already conveyed to 
the OAS through the permanent representative to that 
organization. 
  He believes the "leak" could affect the calm consideration 
of 
issues still pending for study by the committee. 
  The CIDH preliminary report indicates that the trial for 
illegal possession of weapons and illegal enrichment are based 
on "evidence obtained illegally" because action was taken 
without a court order and without the presence of a prosecutor. 
  But the forceful part of the report is the condemnation over 
the violations of the human rights of ex-President Garcia, his 
wife, and children. 
  Minister Goldenberg labeled the classification of Peru as a 
"narco state" by a French independent organization as completely 
out of place. 
  He said Peru was once in danger of becoming a "narco state" 
but this is no longer the case. 
  He stated categorically that it is not state policy to 
encourage the production, consumption, and traffic of drugs. 
  On the country, he said, Peru fights that criminal activity 
and the "results can be seen." 
  He said that the French organization was probably using old 
information. 
  He added: "The newspapers now frequently show the capture of 
light planes and other concrete facts." 
  Goldenberg did not want to be more specific of when there 
was a danger of becoming a narco state. At the insistence of 
reporters he said, smiling, that he was not referring to the 
Middle Ages "but to a recent period." 
  Goldenberg also revealed that Peru has signed agreements on 
investment protection with Paraguay, Colombia, France, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and that one is 
about to be signed with the United States. 
  He expressed the government's great interest in continuing 
to 
sign this type of agreements with all countries with which it 
maintains relations. 
  Goldenberg also talked about the recent creation of the 
National Patriotic Council [Junta Patriotica Nacional--JPN] 
headed by Hugo de Zela Hurtado which strongly defends the 
enforcement of the 1929 Treaty with Chile and demands the 
annulment of the harmful 1993 Lima Convention. 
  In a conciliatory tone, Goldenberg said the government fully 
agrees with the objectives of the council but refused to talk 
about annulling the questioned convention. 
  He said the government will at no time neglect the defense 
and protection of national interests. 
  He said the enforcement of treaties is part of the 
government 
policy and that there is no need to worry about the government 
failing to enforce international treaties or neglecting the 
country's interest. 
  Foreign Minister Goldenberg made these comments after 
signing 
an important food aid agreement with U.S. Ambassador Alvin 
Adams, USAID Director George Wachtenheim, and Peruvian Economy 
Minister Jorge Camet.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has asked 
Strobe Talbott, U.S. assistant secretary of state, for his 
country's assistance in fighting corruption, given this struggle 
cannot be waged within the limits of Venezuela alone and 
requires the support of major countries to efficiently combat 
it. Corruption at home sometimes has implications abroad, the 
official has said. 
  Will the extradition of those who have committed offenses be 
discussed? a reporter asked. It is still too early to talk 
about that, but I congratulate you for your imagination, Escovar 
replied during the departure of the U.S. retinue of top 
officials comprising Joan Spero, assistant secretary of state 
for economic affairs, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary 
of state for inter-American affairs, and Ambassador Jeffrey 
Davidow. 
  The interior minister also discussed with them certain 
topics 
related to the problem of the governability of Venezuela and 
Latin America, because in Venezuela, in his words, we have a 
demonstration of what an ungovernable democracy is. "I told them 
that we did not have an economic crisis in Venezuela but, 
rather, the floundering of institutions, the floundering of 
governability, and that is the challenge this government is 
facing." 
  Increasing cooperation with the United States is 
indispensable. We face common challenges, Escovar said, 
regarding the defense of democracy, in addition to something 
that is very important: the need for major countries' 
cooperation in fighting corruption. We need international 
cooperation, because we want to chase certain crimes of 
corruption out from Venezuelan borders, hence the support we are 
requesting from the international community. 
  U.S. official Talbott talked to reporters about the positive 
results of the meeting with the interior minister. [passage 
omitted].

<F P=106> [Report by the Cecilia Canones from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] According to Senator Aydee Castillo de Lopez, 
president of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, it is highly 
unusual for the United States to deny asylum to Haitian 
refugees, while, at the same time, asking Venezuela to receive 
them. The senator added that Venezuela currently is not in the 
best of economic and social conditions to receive the Haitian 
refugees. 
  She stressed that it was quite unexpected that a highly 
developed nation such as the United States has decided not to 
give the refugees asylum, and yet it has asked a country like 
Venezuela--a nation facing a crisis--to receive them. She added 
that what is even more unusual is that the Venezuelan Government 
has decided to accept the request.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  The Superintendency for Foreign Investments--SIEX--has 
reported that foreign investments amounted to $93.6 million in 
May. This represents a 206 percent increase from the $30.5 
million registered in April. SIEX added that the investments 
include $89.4 million in foreign exchange, $2.7 million in real 
estate, and $1.4 million in capital and credits. The investments 
were made in the following sectors: $83.6 million in 
transportation and storage, $47.2 million in manufacturing, $7.2 
million in financial services, $6.4 million in commerce, 
$845,000 in agriculture and animal breeding, and $554,000 in 
construction. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 2-4) 
  Deputy Finance Minister Luis Xavier Grisanti has affirmed 
that the government will privatize the firms that comprise the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana, CVG. He said the government 
wants this process to attract domestic and foreign investors 
because they could contribute capital, technology, markets, and 
management that will make the firms more competitive. Grisanti 
added that public services currently rendered by the CVG will be 
transferred to local governments. (Caracas Union Radio Network 
in Spanish 2200 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  Russian International Oil Company manager Vladimir 
Sustareyev has reported that representatives from three private 
Russian oil firms are attending the Maracaibo oil fair and have 
expressed interest in reaching economic cooperation agreements 
with the Venezuelan oil industry. (Caracas Union Radio Network 
in Spanish 2200 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  A survey shows that there were 40,512 less jobs over the 
past 
three months when compared to the previous three months, and 
109,964 less jobs than in the same three-month period in 1993. 
Venezuelan Council of Industry President Jorge Redmond said 
these figures show the difficult situation faced by the 
manufacturing sector. The poll shows that the economic 
instability of the past three months has prompted a 22.4 percent 
decline in production and a 21.8 percent drop in demand. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 2-7) 
  Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking 
Protection Fund [FOGADE], has stated at Miraflores Palace that 
FOGADE will reorganize or privatize the seven banks and the 
other financial institution FOGADE is currently assisting if 
their shareholders do not repay their debts and increase their 
capital holdings within the scheduled time frame. (Caracas Union 
Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 2 Jun 94) 
  Environment Minister Roberto Perez Lecuna has reported that 
the executive branch has approved an emergency program to 
revitalize the water treatment program in the metropolitan area, 
earmarking 4.2 billion bolivares for this program. Perez 
reported that "efforts have begun" to obtain a 500-million 
bolivar loan that will allow "the total reorganization of the 
Caracas sewer system." (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 
2200 GMT 31 May 94)

<F P=106> [Interview with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle by </F>
correspondent Raquel Correa; place and date not given -- 
passages between italics are editorial commentary] 
  [Text] President Frei says he is "at easy and 
relaxed" despite his turbulent first two months in government. 
He was even accused of being "frivolous," something no one 
would have ever thought of him. 
  [Frei] If I go out, people say I am "marketing." If I do not 
go out, they will say I am living in a capsule. 
  [Correa] Which of these two evils do you prefer? 
  [Frei] I prefer frivolity to isolation. He smiles 
  He looks very young in the solemn halls of La Moneda 
Palace, but he has the dignity proper of a head of state. The 
difference begins with his formal treatment of people. The Frei 
of "the new times" little resembles the old Frei. He 
stresses: 
  [Frei] I am the same person I have always been. 
  Some people criticize him because he goes to see his 
soccer team (The "U" Universidad de Chile) play, and he 
answers: 
  [Frei] What do they expect? I have gone to watch soccer 
matches all my life. Why would I stop now? 
  He was also criticized while being treated at a clinic, 
while he was president-elect, for coming to the window wearing 
pajamas with his wife. 
  [Frei] Had I been operated on four years ago, nobody would 
have cared. But I was president-elect and a lot of reporters 
started gathering in the street outside. I came out to greet 
them so they could see that I was alright, that I did not have 
cancer or anything else serious. 
  [Correa] And the controversial picture of a shoe-polisher at 
your feet? 
  [Frei] I have had my shoes polished in the streets my entire 
life. The only difference is that this time they took a 
picture. Frei says with the logic of the civil engineer he 
is. I do not prepare shows. The shoe-polisher event 
happened because it was a day of public audiences and there were 
photographers around. 
  He says nothing has really bothered him since he came 
to power. He sleeps seven or eight hours every night and half an 
hour after lunch in the bedroom beside his office. Then he 
walks out renewed. 
  [Correa] Did the Stange [Carabineros Chief Rodolfo Stange] 
affair disturb your sleep? 
  [Frei] Not at all. 
  The teachers' strike did not keep him awake either. 
  [Correa] Are you annoyed by criticism? What about the 
criticism from the opposition and from the coalition? Do you 
dismiss it or do you study it? 
  [Frei] It depends. If it is made in good faith, I receive it 
well. I do not like negative criticism. I do not even consider 
it. I think about criticism based on a valid point. I ponder 
and analyze myself a lot. 
  [Correa] Do you think your popularity has increased or 
decreased since you came to power? 
  [Frei] I do not know. All I know is that I have been warmly 
received everywhere I go. 
  [Correa] Are you getting used to being president? 
  [Frei] It is a lot of work he replies with grace 
but I enjoy working. 
  [Correa] Did you say working with former President Augusto 
Pinochet? 
  [Frei] No. He understands the joke immediately and 
smiles. 
  [Correa] What is the best thing about being president? 
  [Frei] First, I have the opportunity to do things, solve 
problems; second, I enjoy people's support. In a more personal 
area, I like to rest at the Vina del Mar presidential residence. 
Besides, the palace brings to my mind many memories. Memories 
of my father when he was president, when I was dating Martita. 
  [Correa] What do you resent the most? 
  [Frei] The lack of time for myself. I must work 12, 14, 16 
hours. 
  [Correa] Are you paid well? 
  [Frei] It would embarrass me to show you my paycheck. If I 
tell you how much I make people will say I am "marketing." 
  [Correa] How much? 
  [Frei] Seven hundred forty eight thousand pesos, after 
deductions. Grade one level. 
  [Correa] You also receive expenses and representation 
allowances... 
  [Frei] Yes. Here all expenditures are considered expenses. 
We have a budget for the presidency and all expenditures are 
considered expenses. This should be changed and we should have 
a current account. This matter of expenses is absurd. 
  [Correa] Some people have compared your wife to Hillary 
Clinton. How do you think Martita Frei is doing as the first 
lady? 
  [Frei] She is a very dedicated worker, she is working hard 
with new ideas, new projects. I believe the people value her 
contribution at the institutions over which she presides? 
  [Correa] Have you felt the loneliness that comes with power? 
  [Frei] Very little. In my position one has to deal with 
sudden developments all the time. My intercom is always open 
and the ministers all call me at any time. In the beginning, 
one tends to get too involved in the details but soon enough one 
realizes that one must focus on the essence. I hardly have any 
time to be alone and sometimes one needs some quiet time alone 
to read, to think, to ponder, to rest. 
  [Correa] Would you say that this administration is still 
going through a break-in period? 
  [Frei] A very important goal was reached on 21 May. From the 
very beginning we set ourselves very specific objectives, among 
them poverty as our first priority. We now have a well 
coordinated inter-ministerial team. 
  [Correa] Was that the job of the Planning and Coordination 
Ministry? 
  [Frei] Poverty is a multisector issue. This week, we started 
the National Poverty Commission. We also assumed a firm 
position regarding ethical standards and honesty, so this 
commission is working very effectively. 
  [Correa] Do you believe commissions guarantee honesty? 
  [Frei] No... Honesty can be guaranteed through a set of 
proposals which the commission is preparing. These proposals 
call for legal and administrative changes. The commission will 
establish regulations on incompatible activities and 
disqualifying circumstances. The commission has representatives 
from all branches of government: the chairman of the Senate, the 
chairman of the Supreme Court, the comptroller general, the 
State Defense Council. This issue has received international 
support and we have been asked to bring it up at the 
Ibero-American Summit which will take place in Miami in December. 
  [Correa] So the break-in period is over? 
  [Frei] That is up to the people to judge. We have set our 
priorities and have done so considering historical 
circumstances. Our actions have been well received by the people. 
  [Correa] Members of the Coalition of Parties for Democracy 
[CPPD] have been complaining that your message to Congress, your 
so-called "navigation chart" was better received by the 
opposition than by your own supporters. 
  [Frei] This is a groundless complaint. The presidential 
message to Congress outlined at least 16 bills already being 
processed and some 50 other initiatives that will be launched 
over the next 18 months. I would say that the break-in period 
is over. But the period was necessary. In any human endeavor, 
one must get the team together, get the people involved, 
establish trust and loyalty. 
  [Correa] Is the CPPD loyal to you? 
  [Frei] It has to be. During my electoral campaign I talked a 
great deal about the lack of loyalty my father had to endure. 
Perhaps the enormous number of votes I received was due to my 
steadfast loyalty to President Aylwin's administration. 
  [Correa] Your father tried to carry out a "revolution in 
freedom;" while your predecessor Patricio Aylwin proposed a 
government for "national reconciliation." What is the slogan of 
your administration? 
  [Frei] I would like my administration to be remembered for 
its struggle against poverty and marginalization. On a broader 
scale, I would like to take advantage of this historic 
opportunity Chile has to further its development. 
  [Correa] Critics from within the administration and the 
opposition have been saying that your administration has no set 
course of action, nor leadership. They say it is obvious that 
you have no political experience. What is your answer? 
  [Frei] What is the point of defending myself? Let the people 
be the judges. We have established certain goals and deadlines 
for the 70 days prior to our message to Congress which contains 
a set of definitions. 
  [Correa] Do you think your government has wasted 70 days...? 
  [Frei] I do not think the country has lost 70 days. We 
could review each sector separately... For example, Codelco 
[Copper Corporation]. In what state was it when we came to 
government? What is its situation now? 
  We submitted a draft bill to Congress to modernize the most 
important Chilean enterprise, to make it more efficient. By 
eliminating the operations management in Santiago, Codelco has 
already changed radically. The mining district managers are now 
the top managers of the respective enterprises. In less than 70 
days, we submitted to Congress a draft bill heading in the right 
direction. 
  This week he continues we closed a deal that will 
entail an investment of more than $1 million. In the public 
works sector, we have called for bids for two or three 
significant projects and other important ones will be called 
soon. We progressed in the fields of poverty, health, and 
regionalization. We will double regional investments. We have 
tackled the vital Arica and Magallanes problems because we do 
not avoid our problems... We have decidedly progressed in the 
privatization project. 
  [Correa] Are you talking about LAN [Chilean National 
Airline], and the electricity company...? 
  [Frei] Obviously. The problems affecting LAN, Northern 
Electricity Company, and State Maritime Enterprise have been 
solved. We will continue on this path. 
  [Copper] Everything except the privatization of Codelco? 
  [Frei] We believe Codelco's four most important mining 
districts should remain in the state's hands. 
  [Correa] What about Colbun-Machicura? 
  [Frei] We might privatize it. Enterprises that are not 
monopolies and which need great investments, which the state 
cannot afford, might be privatized. For example, in the health 
sector, Chile currently spends 4 or 5 percent of its GDP but, do 
you know how much we invest in the health sector? Eighty million 
dollars. Should I invest $40 million to get Empremar on its 
feet again? No. The private sector must do that. 
  But he continues, drinking a glass of mineral 
water no one should expect the government to solve in just 
70 days problems that have existed for more than 70 years, like 
the coal mining sector. No one can expect us to solve the health 
and education problems in 70 days. We are identifying the great 
problems that need to be solved. It would have been very easy 
for us to say: In the education field let us submit a draft bill 
to Congress referring to subsidies and easy problems, without 
tackling the core of the problem. We must tackle the core of 
the problem in the education field or we will remain an 
underdeveloped country. We must increase teaching hours. 
  [Correa] Will the reform of the Teachers Statutes include 
the 
elimination of the clause by which teachers cannot be replaced? 
  [Frei] We do not want to dismiss teachers. We want to 
expand the teaching hours, which means we need more teachers. 
But they must be redistributed. Changes are feasible through 
dialogue. 
  [Correa] The teachers maintain the government did not 
consult 
them before submitting the draft bill to Congress... 
  [Frei] They wanted a private dialogue first and this is what 
we did. We never interrupted the dialogue. But, definitely, no 
one can say that in these 70 past days, we have not tackled 
crucial problems. 
  [Correa] People believe you are distant regarding important 
problems. You never publicly stated your opinion regarding 
Stange, the teachers problem, the negotiations over the minimum 
salary... 
  [Frei] We work as a team and are constantly evaluating. The 
president makes the decisions and this is what I have been 
doing. If I had not been involved in the important issues, I 
would have not signed the draft bill regarding the Teacher's 
Statutes. I have been involved in the main decisions. As for 
publicly disclosing decisions, I am not the government 
spokesman. I am here to work and make decisions with a true 
national meaning. 
  What did I do on my first visit to Concepcion? I 
acknowledged the coal miners' problem. Do not tell me I have 
been aloof. We are negotiating, working on the subject and will 
make a series of proposals. The same goes for Arica. 
Obviously, economic issues are dealt with through permanent 
contact with the finance minister. 
  [Correa] You said you would assess the public servants 180 
days after you came to power. Will you change any ministers? 
  [Frei] When I said that I referred to all public servants, 
so 
why should some ministers not be replaced? 
  [Correa] And will they be removed? 
  [Frei] I have been putting together an excellent team. I am 
very pleased with it, but it goes without saying that the post 
of minister entails the president of the Republic's trust. 
Ministers stay in their posts as long as they have the 
president's confidence. 
  [Correa] Your political team has come under fire on charges 
that it is not a real team, that it is not well-structured, that 
there are internal struggles. Do you believe it is a matter of 
time or is there a problem of incompatibility of temperaments? 
  [Frei] Whenever there is a new administration, there is 
obviously a period of adjustment. So far, we have been engaged 
in that. The important thing is that there is loyalty, 
coherence, and respect. We have had to confront difficult 
situations, but I am convinced the people will become aware of 
the political team's worth. 
  [Correa] Who is your "right-hand man"? 
  [Frei] Right-hand man? he asks, somewhat surprised. 
  [Correa] The interior minister, the minister secretary 
general of the Presidency, or the defense minister ...? 
  [Frei] It is said that I am closer to this one or that one 
... I have been a friend of Defense Minister Edmundo Perez since 
I was seven ... When one is president, the relationship with 
one's aides goes beyond the realm of personal friendships. I 
get on well with all of them ... There is no "right-hand man," 
rather a working team ... Each ministry has its specific 
function. People are always willing to create differences ... 
In the beginning, it was said: "The president makes mistakes." 
It was then said: "It is not the president, it is his aides who 
make mistakes." I do not believe in those things. We are 
working as a team, which was reflected in the 21 May state of 
the nation address. Obviously one can make mistakes. 
  [Correa] And yet, what mistakes are you willing to 
acknowledge? The "Stange Case" for example? 
  [Frei] In that case, I made a decision, period. I assume my 
responsibility as chief of the team, as president of the 
Republic. 
  [Correa] Would you have acted the same way if Pinochet had 
been the affected party? 
  [Frei] I do not work on hypotheses. 
  [Correa] When Aylwin assumed office as president, he 
requested Pinochet's resignation, why did you not do the same? 
Are you pleased with having him as the commander in chief? 
  [Frei] I reiterate that this is not a personal issue. Power 
has an impersonal stamp. I swore allegiance to the Constitution 
and the law and I shall abide by them. We do not have the 
necessary quorum to change that situation and we have an 
excellent relationship with the commanders in chief. We are 
currently working on major definitions for the future that will 
benefit the country. 
  [Correa] And yet, would you rather Gen. Pinochet went? 
  [Frei] This is not a matter of indulging oneself to 
something 
one wants. I am here to command the nation. 
  [Correa] Why was the issue of human rights conspicuously 
absent from the state of the union address? 
  [Frei] I mentioned it twice during my speech. 
  [Correa] Do you believe, as Aylwin said at La Sorbonne 
University, that what happened concerning human rights under the 
military regime was the worst tragedy that this country had ever 
had to endure? 
  [Frei] Before becoming president, I said I would not comment 
on what others said. Least of all will I comment on what former 
President Aylwin said now that I am in the driver's seat. 
Everyone may voice his own personal views. 
  [Correa] And yet, from a personal standpoint, do you not 
believe this was Chile's worst tragedy ...? 
  [Frei] I was elected president to govern the country with my 
eyes set on the 21st century. My political and historical 
judgment on those events are public knowledge. I have voiced 
them on many occasions. The issue of human rights is not 
closed. Great strides were made under the previous 
administration. The courts are at present dealing with those 
lawsuits and we will endorse their judgment on those cases. 
  [Correa] Would you propose that the country forgets about it 
once and for all? 
  [Frei] We have never talked about closing the issue. 
  [Correa] Do you believe that only one person is responsible 
for Codelco's [Copper Corporation's] loss of $270 million? 
  [Frei] I believe no one can be solely responsible for 
anything in a company as large as Codelco. Right now, we are 
doing everything possible to make sure it does not happen again. 
  [Correa] What do you think about the constitutional charges 
against former Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley? 
  [Frei] I believe the charges against Foxley and against 
Hales 
[Alejandro Hales, mining minister under the Aylwin 
administration], are essentially political. It is not my place 
to pass judgment on the powers of other branches of government. 
I can say, however, that I know them both, and they are very 
honest and committed to public service. 
  [Correa] Is Foxley your candidate for president of the 
Christian Democratic Party [PDC]? 
  [Frei] I have no candidates. 
  [Correa] You have not, however, ceased to be an active PDC 
member. Are you going to vote? 
  [Frei] I have said that I was not prepared to comply with 
the 
responsibilities and duties of active members. It is not my 
place to do so. Most probably, I will not vote at all. I am 
interested only in the unity of the party. I would not he 
smiles do anything at all that could hurt the party. All I 
want is for the party electoral process to develop 
democratically, so that we can have a strong party loyal to the 
administration. 
  [Correa] How would you explain to a foreigner that the 
Chilean president is unable to dismiss the chief of police? 
  [Frei] This is how things are. In 1988, we accepted the fact 
that we would be returning to democracy within a legal framework 
in order to make whatever constitutional changes necessary once 
we took over. In any democratic country in the world, the 
president has the power to appoint or replace the chief of 
police. This issue has not been resolved yet. We did, however, 
swear to obey the Constitution and the laws. 
  [Correa] How can you explain to any human being the fact 
that 
you are not even trying to change these laws that you believe to 
be undemocratic? 
  [Frei] We do not have the majority in Congress to do so. To 
send a bill to this effect would be, at this stage, a formal 
gesture. Not even in the Chamber of Deputies do we have the 
majority necessary to make this constitutional amendment. At 
this stage we have decided to aim at two large reforms: 
modernizing Congress, and reorganizing municipalities nationwide. 
  [Correa] As president of the nation, what is your position 
on 
the inability to remove the commanders in chief of the Armed 
Forces services? 
  [Frei] I believe it to be essential for a democratic 
president to have the power to appoint and remove the commanders 
in chief of the Armed Forces services. 
  [Correa] Do you mean to say that if during your term in 
office you never obtain the required congressional majority in 
Congress, you will not send the bills to reform the Constitution 
to Congress? 
  [Frei] These issues will undergo substantial changes in 
1997. 
I believe they should be debated calmly. As of that date, the 
commanders in chief will stay in office four years. 
  [Correa] What about the designated senators? 
  [Frei] This issue is part of the modernization of Congress. 
Let us discuss this issue now, not in 1997 when many people will 
want the president to appoint the senators he is entitled to by 
law. Is that what we want? It is neither proper nor democratic. 
  [Frei] If no amendment eliminating designated senators is 
passed, will you appoint the ones you are entitled to? 
  [Correa] If I am faced with this situation, yes, I will. I 
do not believe, however, that it would be the right thing to do. 
  [Correa] Does this mean, Mr. President, that you want to do 
away with the positions of designated senators before 1997? 
  [Frei] No. I want the positions eliminated in 1997. It will 
take time, however, to get the electoral reform approved. It is 
better to begin now and do things calmly. 
  [Correa] Under these circumstances, would you say that Chile 
is enjoying full democracy, or is it still in transition? 
  [Frei] We are obviously enjoying full democracy, even though 
there are some constitutional issues, like the ones I mentioned, 
that need to be resolved. Our main issue nowadays is something 
else: How can we improve the democratic system for the future? 
  [Correa] Would you contend that the president of the 
Republic is the highest authority in Chile when he cannot remove 
the Armed Forces commanders in chief? 
  [Frei] The Armed Forces are carrying out an absolutely 
professional task, which is respectful of the sovereign power 
that has been legitimately established. I have an excellent and 
very smooth relationship with the Armed Forces. For us, to put 
an end to the irremovability of the commanders in chief is a 
matter of principle, but given the present state of affairs the 
current situation is absolutely normal. 
  [Correa] What is your opinion of the fact that Army officers 
who are facing charges of human rights violations are still on 
active duty? 
  [Frei] Legal actions are bound to conclude, and one has to 
respect the courts' judgment. That is the role of the courts. 
  [Correa] And yet what is your opinion of the fact that 
officers who are being prosecuted are still on active duty? 
  [Frei] It is always difficult to prejudge if one does not 
have a thorough knowledge of the lawsuits. The important thing 
is that those legal actions take place, and that a sentence be 
passed, and that the people realize that there is an independent 
branch of government (the judiciary) and an administration that 
respects it. 
  [Correa] It has been said that you left the Stange issue in 
the hands of the defense minister, your fellow party member 
Edmundo Perez Yoma, because you do not trust Interior Minister 
German Correa because he is a Socialist, and this something the 
Armed Forces abhors. 
  [Frei] Look, when I decided to appoint German Correa I was 
perfectly aware that I was going to endure difficulties and 
complications. 
  [Correa] Do you believe it was a mistake to appoint him? 
  [Frei] No, quite the contrary. As time goes by, I am more 
and more convinced that it was not a mistake. No one is banned 
from any posts in Chile. We are talking about the future, not 
the past. I give German Correa my wholehearted support for his 
loyalty and his work as interior minister. I am very happy with 
him, and if I had to appoint a cabinet, I would designate him 
again to the Interior Ministry. 
  [Correa] Why are you hiding him, then? 
  [Frei] I am not hiding him at all. Quite the contrary, he 
enjoys my full support. He has worked very effectively 
regarding Carabineros operations... It seems that the issue of 
the security of citizens, an issue that was so much discussed, 
has been forgotten in the country, whereas previously it was 
insistently demanded... It is obvious that there are people that 
are shooting on both sides of the line. This is like a 
political terrorism based on rumors. This is bad for the country 
and for democracy. I am very happy with the work German Correa 
is doing. 
  [Correa] Based on analyses and opinions on the issue, we can 
deduce there is widespread consensus that the government 
mishandled the Stange situation. Do you believe this criticism 
is correct? 
  [Frei] Let us review the situation. sighs First 
of all, the situation concerning Gen. Stange is not the 
responsibility of this administration. It is a process that 
started in 1985 when three professionals were slain. The entire 
country is aware of how the incidents developed. The court case 
is over; Carabineros members have been sentenced by the courts. 
  Second, we uphold the Constitution and the law. The 
president is not empowered to change the Carabineros commander. 
Third, there is the organizational issue. We believe the 
Carabineros are not part of the Armed Forces; and therefore they 
should not be under Defense Ministry jurisdiction. In fact, 
operationally the Carabineros today fall under Interior Ministry 
jurisdiction. The Interior Ministry is in charge of 
safeguarding the citizens' security; and therefore everything 
concerning the Carabineros should be handled by the Interior 
Ministry. Everything pertaining to security lies with the 
Interior Ministry, but with no authority because 
administratively the Carabineros fall under the jurisdiction of 
the Defense Ministry. That is how the situation stands. 
  [Correa] If you could turn the clock back, would you again 
ask Gen. Stange to retire despite the fact that the law does not 
empower you to force him to go? 
  [Frei] I asked him to make a gesture, and I would do it 
again. 
  [Correa] Don't you think it was a mistake to make such a 
request if it depended solely on his willingness? 
  [Frei] When you occupy the president's chair, you have to 
make decisions. Gestures are also very important. 
  [Correa] Who advised you to make this request? 
  [Frei] I assume full responsibility in this regard. I am the 
president of the Republic, and I discussed the issue directly 
with Gen. Stange. The easiest thing to do would have been to 
entrust this task to someone else, but as a government leader I 
assume full responsibility. 
  [Correa] You mentioned moral reasons. Do you feel your 
authority as a ruler has been undermined? 
  [Frei] Absolutely not. I am not empowered to do this, but 
for the sake of the integrity of institutions and for the good 
of the government, I did the proper thing. 
  [Correa] Honestly speaking, do you trust Stange? 
  [Frei] This is not a personal problem. I am fulfilling my 
role as president of the Republic, and he as done the same as 
Carabineros director general. Each one, in compliance with the 
responsibilities established in the Constitution and the law, 
makes his own decisions. 
  [Correa] My question was whether or not you trust Stange? 
  [Frei] I refer to the official government statements. 
  [Correa] Do you think he seriously failed in his military 
duties? 
  [Frei] That has to be determined by the courts. 
  [Correa] If this has to be determined by the courts, why 
then 
was Stange asked to resign before the courts issued a verdict? 
  [Frei] Because it entailed a court case that has lasted nine 
years; for the sake of good government; for the sake of the 
integrity of the Carabineros. 
  [Correa] Based on these words, we can conclude that Stange 
does not enjoy your trust and that he seriously failed in his 
duties. 
  [Frei] I did not say that. Everything is stated clearly in 
the official government statement. 
  [Correa] If the courts declare him innocent, do you still 
think he should retire? 
  [Frei] I cannot comment on a theory, only on facts. What has 
been said suffices. The entire country is well aware of my 
position on this issue. There are no more comments to make on 
the issue. 
  [Correa] Specifically, how will this issue be resolved? Will 
it be indefinitely postponed? 
  [Frei] We will try to reach a consensus. 
  [Correa] Why did you leave out the paragraph on Gen. Stange 
from your 21 May address? 
  [Frei] Because it was 80 pages long and I only read 40. I 
decided which paragraphs were worthy of reading. 
  [Correa] Have you decided on a solution to this problem or 
will you continue to improvise? 
  [Frei] No, everything regarding the Carabineros has already 
been said. 
  [Correa] What has your administration decided regarding 
Chile 
joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
  [Frei] Our international economic policy is based on an open 
regionalism. We are interested in achieving Latin American 
integration. This is why in the past few years we have 
concentrated our efforts on achieving bilateral agreements, but 
in today's world there are other realities, such as NAFTA, APEC 
[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation], and the European Union. 
Today, Mercosur is one of the most dynamic groups in Latin 
America. Chile has sharply increased its exports to Latin 
America; almost two-thirds of our manufactured export goods go 
to the Latin American market. Within this context, Argentina 
and Brazil are our main partners. Trade between Chile and 
Mercosur members has increased more than five-fold in the last 
six or seven years. Moreover, Mercosur is negotiating with the 
EU; therefore, we cannot be left out of this market. 
  [Correa] Mr. President, what is the meaning of all this? 
That Chile will join Mercosur? 
  [Frei] We have not proposed joining Mercosur. We will 
propose the establishment of free trade zone within the 
framework of this regionalization opened between Chile and 
Mercosur. We are very interested in this, and we believe it is 
an issue of utmost importance. We are drafting a proposal to be 
submitted at the Cartagena de Indias Ibero-American Summit to be 
held next month, based on these terms. I will attend the Rio 
Group meeting that will be held in September, and in December we 
will be meeting with President Clinton at the Summit of the 
Americas. Moreover, there is also the trip to Jakarta, where 
Chile will be admitted to APEC. We obviously want to play a 
preponderant role at the regional level. Latin American 
integration plays a fundamental part in Chilean foreign policy. 
  [Correa] Is joining NAFTA a government priority? 
  [Frei] Chile exports almost one-third of its GDP; it cannot 
be absent from big markets. Our presence in APEC; the start of 
formal negotiations with the United States to achieve a free 
trade agreement; and our relation with the EU and regional 
markets are the guidelines of our foreign economic policy. 
Within this framework, we believe it is essential to 
consolidate our integrationist position in Latin America. We 
are part of this region; they are our neighbors. It is our 
culture. They receive two-thirds of our manufactured exports. 
Individually, our countries have little to say before large 
economic groups -- APEC, EU, and NAFTA -- therefore inasmuch as 
we can consolidate a free trade region and all the multinational 
initiatives in which Chile takes part, I believe we are treading 
on the right path. 
  [Correa] Does the government plan to achieve bilateral 
agreements with those Latin American countries with which there 
are not any, such as Ecuador and Brazil? 
  [Frei] This is very important. Our experiences with those 
countries with which we have signed bilateral agreements have 
been extraordinarily successful. We can cite Mexico, and 
particularly Argentina, where Chilean investments total $1 
billion; there are also binational undertakings such as the oil 
pipeline dedicated by President Menem and President Aylwin; and 
a gas pipeline project that will demand a significant 
investment. We have just undertaken studies to build a tunnel 
that will demand significant investment from our two countries. 
All this goes to prove that bilateral agreements work. This 
does not mean we are overlooking multilateral agreements. This 
is why we are members of the Rio Group; why we want to establish 
a free trade region within the framework of Mercosur; and why we 
are members of Latin American Integration Association. 
  [Correa] Chilean agriculture is worried about Chile's 
possible membership in NAFTA. 
  [Frei] A country like ours cannot be absent from these great 
opportunities. We will achieve this safeguarding national 
interests; we will see whether we will only join a free trade 
agreement or also join NAFTA. This will be decided in the next 
stage. Negotiations are just starting. I believe this will be 
very beneficial for Chile in the long term, as we are an 
exporting country. President Clinton will be announcing within 
the next three or four months what countries the United States 
can achieve these kind of agreements with. Only then will 
negotiations be undertaken prior to congressional approval. All 
interested parties -- and of course agriculture -- will be 
represented in these negotiations. 
  [Correa] You hope to lower the inflation rate to one digit. 
On a scale of one to nine, which digit? Frei laughs. 
  [Frei] As we engineers like to say: leaning more toward zero 
and he draws a descending arrow on a pad of paper. 
In view of the current national economic situation, we are 
interested in basically maintaining a macroeconomic balance. 
Everything that has been achieved, with so much effort, will be 
safeguarded fiercely. There are corporate interests. It is our 
duty to maintain this balance. Inflation, among them, is an 
important factor because it has a great impact on wage and 
salary earners. The country can be certain that we will be 
inflexible in this regard. 
  [Correa] In your message, you estimated an 11 percent 
inflation rate for 1994. Do you believe it is necessary to 
extend the economic adjustment process? 
  [Frei] I believe that the economic adjustment process is 
almost completed. This is why we hope to achieve an average 
annual economic growth of 5.5 percent during my administration. 
  [Correa] It will be 3.4 percent this year. 
  [Frei] Four to 4.5 percent. We will be quite inflexible 
regarding fiscal expenses. We will not be pressured by any 
national group. Balances will be maintained; we will struggle 
to achieve a low inflation rate. To overcome poverty, we must 
develop and grow. There is no other way. The entire country is 
aware of the economic conditions in which we inherited the 
country; that an economic adjustment was implemented; and that 
all the figures are showing that the economic adjustment period 
is ending. We have been extremely careful regarding government 
spending, and we will continue to be so. 
  [Correa] Mr. President, the only way to curb inflation is to 
lower fiscal spending, which in the previous administration 
totaled an average of 7.5 percent while economic growth totalled 
6.5 percent. 
  [Frei] We will be inflexible regarding taxes, monetary 
matters, inflation, and fiscal spending,, too. The country 
cannot spend more than the GDP. We will maintain a fiscal 
balance; there will be no deficit. 
  [Correa] What measures will be implemented if inflation is 
not curbed? 
  [Frei] All the ones that are necessary to achieve a 
one-digit 
inflation rate within a prudent period of time.

  [Excerpt] The Army has categorically denied that its 
commander in chief, Captain General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte, is 
traveling with a false passport "because he is traveling with an 
official passport issued by the Chilean Government to public 
authorities fulfilling official duties abroad." As for reports 
that Pinochet had to hastily check out of a hotel in the 
Netherlands, the Army stated through a communique that the 
reports "are inaccurate" because the high-ranking official "has 
fulfilled the scheduled itinerary without any changes." 
  The Army communique ends by stating that in Prague, capital 
of the Czech Republic, Gen. Pinochet was received by Chilean 
Ambassador Rolando Stein and the Omnipol Company president, who 
held a reception in his honor. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 6 June (EFE) -- The Chilean courts on 6 
June sentenced Juan Andres Lagos, director of EL SIGLO, and 
reporter Francisco Herreros to 541 days in jail for "serious 
offenses" against Supreme Court members. 
  The process began with the charges filed by Supreme Court 
President Marcos Aburto after EL SIGLO criticized the Supreme 
Court decision to transfer the case of a missing political 
prisoner to the military court. 
  In commenting on the decision made by Judge Maria Antonia 
Morales, the director of the newspaper with communist leanings 
said that, unfortunately, in Chile "freedom of expression and 
press has serious limitations." 
  Lagos said: "We made a public judgment of political, legal, 
and justified nature regarding a decision by a Supreme Court 
chamber that created major commotion in our country that even 
led a court member to leave his post after Congress studied the 
situation." 
  Lagos said that time has proven their position right because 
the military court definitely dismissed the case for the arrest 
and disappearance of Alfonso Chanfreaux in 1974. 
  Defense lawyer Eduardo Contreras recalled that for a similar 
case and during the same time the director and a columnist for 
the conservative daily EL MERCURIO were acquitted. 
  The two men announced they will appeal the court sentence, 
which they could serve in freedom but under the custody of a 
penitentiary guard. 
  Lagos reiterated that with sentences like the one they 
received, serious obstacles are being established against 
freedom of expression and restrictions imposed on the critical 
judgment of certain branches of government.

  [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 6 Jun (EFE) -- On 6 June, 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, constitutional president of Haiti, 
suggested to the members of the OAS the need for armed action 
against the coupists who took power in 1991. 
  Although in his address to the OAS foreign ministers, who 
are 
holding an extraordinary meeting to discuss the Haitian problem, 
Aristide said the Constitution did not allow him to request a 
military occupation. During a news conference afterward, he 
suggested the idea of armed action against the military coupists. 
  "We are talking about a minuscule group of military coupists 
who are deeply involved in the narcotics business," the 
overthrown Haitian president said, also referring to an 
agreement to fight drug trafficking which he had signed with the 
United States in 1991, when he was still the president of Haiti. 
  Before this, Aristide had stressed in his address to the OAS 
foreign ministers that he believed that "military action could 
be carried out to free the nation from the bandits who have 
taken it hostage and reestablish democracy in Haiti." 
  "Quick and decisive action must therefore be taken to oust 
the military leaders within the framework of the Governor's 
Island (New York) agreements," the president said, adding that 
"the international community knows how to proceed." 
  This agreement, which was signed by coupist General Raoul 
Cedras in July 1993 at the behest of the United Nations and the 
OAS, indicated that a military unit should be sent to Haiti to 
help with the transition, and that power be returned to him. 
  The unit that was sent, however, which consisted of U.S. and 
Canadian troops, was not able to disembark, as when it arrived 
off the coast of Haiti in October 1993 it encountered the 
opposition of the Haitian coupist forces. 
  During his news conference, Aristide stated that the "rapid 
and decisive action" to which he had referred would have as its 
goal "the liberation of the (Haitian) Army from its high 
command, and at the same time giving the nation, as a whole, its 
freedom," but always without directly asking for international 
military intervention in his country. 
  Aristide stressed that the current period, when Haiti's 
borders are completely closed to international trade in 
accordance with the total embargo that the Security Council 
implemented in May, must be taken advantage of, because "if 
there is no action the embargo will create a very detrimental 
process." 
  According to Aristide, the coupist military leadership 
annually obtains $1.2 billion from drug trafficking, and during 
the 7 months that he governed in 1991 before becoming the victim 
of the military coup, he had signed an agreement to fight drug 
trafficking with then U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle. 
  The constitutional president of Haiti, who has been living 
in 
exile, indicated that the fight against narcotics in his country 
had been strengthened through this agreement, and that it was 
decisive in the reasons for the coup. 
  The contents of his news conference differs with the spirit 
of optimism and hope contained in his address to the OAS foreign 
ministers participating in the "ad hoc" meeting. Aristide also 
asked for the immediate deployment of the technical cooperation 
mission that was established in the Governor's Island agreements. 
  In his address, the deposed president proposed a program, to 
be implemented after recovering the presidency, that would allow 
his country "to go from a state of misery to a state of poverty 
with dignity." 
  Concluding his address with another show of optimism 
regarding a quick solution to his country's crisis, Aristide 
even invited the OAS foreign ministers to hold next year's OAS 
General Assembly in Haiti.

  [Text] On 7 June, Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso 
stated that there are currently 121 people, including men, 
women, and children, inside the Belgian Embassy. This 
information was relayed to the Foreign Ministry by the Belgian 
diplomats in Havana. Regarding this event, Alfonso stated that 
the Cuban Government as well as the Belgian Government are in 
complete agreement regarding key principles in connection with 
this situation. He added that no negotiations per se are being 
conducted except talks on how to implement commonly accepted 
principles, and that everyone understands that this is an 
illegal action which has nothing to do with international laws. 
  On the other hand, Alfonso pointed out that for the Belgian 
Government, which subscribes to a traditional policy, diplomatic 
asylum does not exist, in the sense that it is not recognized 
because this is a purely Latin American tradition. 
  [Alfonso] "Everyone agrees, Cuba and Belgium, that this is 
no 
way to circumvent the normal requirements for emigrating from 
Cuba. The Cuban Government has reiterated several highly 
important issues. Cuba recognizes the inviolability of the 
Belgian Embassy in Havana. Cuba has international obligations 
that commit Cuba, on one hand, to ensure that that inviolability 
is not impaired. Once violated, however, the Cuban authorities 
have of course historically abstained -- you might remember, for 
example, the case of the Peruvian Embassy -- from taking any 
action to further impair the inviolability of that embassy that 
has been violated. This must be stressed to the people who 
entered it illegally, not by Cuban authorities. 
  "The Cuban Government reiterates that this method of 
forcibly 
gaining entrance to an embassy cannot be a way to circumvent the 
normal emigration procedures available to every Cuban citizen." 
  Alfonso also announced that the Cuban Government has 
extended 
the necessary resources, if required by the Belgian Embassy, in 
terms of health services. Regarding food needs, several 
possibilities have been proposed to solve the crisis that the 
Embassy is currently facing, with the cooperation of other 
embassies from the European Union. The Cuban Red Cross, a 
nongovernmental organization, has stated that this type of event 
is beyond their field of operations. The government had already 
extended the public health services that every Cuban citizen is 
entitled to, hwever. 
  The Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed that the Cuban 
Government has stated and reiterated that independent of the 
illegal character of the event, reprisals will not be taken 
against these people once they leave the Embassy. He added that 
if any of them has any prior charges pending with Cuban justice, 
a completely different issue, they will not be considered an 
aggravating element in the illegal entry to the Embassy. 
  [Alfonso] "Everyone knows that independent of the basic 
illegality of this action, other illegalities have been 
committed. In other words, even if someone should see this as a 
diplomatic asylum issue, it is a fact that activities of a 
political nature from inside the Embassy are not permissible. 
Communiques have been released and disseminated in a completely 
startling manner to the media. You know that only authorized 
personnel enter and leave that Embassy. We know that political 
communiques drafted inside the Embassy have been disseminated 
abroad after these people entered the Embassy." 
  Miguel Alfonso added that currently, two Belgian diplomats 
are in Havana to help Embassy personnel, given the altogether 
abnormal situation that has ensued, and that talks continue 
between the Belgian Foreign Ministry and Embassy and the Cuban 
Foreign Ministry.

  [Text] The process aimed at suppressing money hoarders is 
not a campaign, but a legal proceeding that will continue after 
the first phase, begun on 16 May, is completed. Government 
spokesmen have reiterated the commitment not to stop halfway 
through this struggle against ill-gotten wealth, in an effort to 
eliminate the causes behind money hoarding. The authorities are 
working expeditiously within Decree Law 149 to achieve this. 
  To date, and as a direct result of the process, 222 citizens 
have been registered as money hoarders. These now have to prove, 
through documents, the ownership of 180 cars, 83 motorbikes, 48 
trucks, 24 tractors, 108 houses, and over 3.5 million pesos. The 
provinces with the most cases and largest amounts of goods are 
Havana City, Havana, Pinar del Rio, and Camaguey. There are also 
cases in other provinces. 
  The way in which these people became wealthy is significant, 
in general, as is the fact that they foster criminal activities 
and various crimes. There are, for example, people dealing in 
meat, spare car parts, and tires. There are also those who 
repair old cars. This allows many of them to build houses like 
the eight-room home a citizen from Ciego de Avila is erecting on 
a salary of less than 300 pesos. He also owns a truck, a car, 
and a floor-tile machine. 
  The main goal of the process against the money hoarders is 
not to prove the legitimacy of the goods, but to demonstrate 
whether they correlate with the means of the citizen in 
question. In other words, they must prove their source of 
income. Of the 222 cases registered to date, 42 percent are 
unemployed, 8 percent are small farmers, another 8 percent are 
managers of grocery stores, meat shops, workshops, and other 
such facilities. Precautionary measures have been implemented 
against all of them. 
  Bank accounts had not been the indicator that began the 
process against the money hoarders. The privacy of these 
accounts is being preserved. Only when the case calls for it 
does the bank come into play -- to provide details. 
  Currently, according to reports by sources from the attorney 
general's office, they are working to conclude the first cases. 
This involves four careful steps, from the prosecutor's office 
to the Ministry of Finance, in order to ultimately determine 
confiscation of the money hoarders' ill-gotten goods.

  [Text] One of the five factions that comprise the Farabundo 
Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN] has rejected the 
possibility of striking an alliance with the other factions, 
thereby demonstrating that internal differences still persist 
within the party. Guillermo Valencia filed this report: 
  [Begin recording] [Valencia] The FMLN's political future 
remains uncertain. On 4 and 5 June, the Revolutionary Party of 
Central American Workers [PRTC] advocated a new unity pact, but 
it rejected an alliance. 
  [Unidentified speaker] We must reach an agreement with those 
we identify with in terms of politics, programs, and what a 
leftist party should be. 
  [Valencia] Have you talked about striking an alliance? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Actually, we do not know what our 
conclusions will be; however, according to the negotiations we 
have held so far with the rank and file, we are not likely to 
strike an alliance among the five FMLN factions. 
  [Valencia] The Communist Party of El Salvador, the People's 
Revolutionary Army, and the National Resistance last week agreed 
to seek a new alliance. However, the PRTC pointed out that it 
is unwilling to enter into a pact of this kind. Instead, it 
will come to an agreement with only those movements that are 
advocating a new kind of pact. 
  [Unidentified female speaker] This is a practical problem. 
The FMLN has limitations and lacks force as long as it cannot 
reach unified opinions and beliefs. Our struggle consists of 
forging a strong left and constructive opposition, but it must 
be coherent in its proposals and actions. Should we strike an 
alliance based upon the understanding of common issues, anyone 
could at any moment strike an alliance with other sectors that 
oppose the new agreement. 
  [Valencia] The FMLN National Council on 26 June will meet to 
decide on ways to approach a new political pact. [end recording]

  [Text] Managua, 7 Jun (DPA) -- Approximately 30 former 
Sandinist soldiers occupied the Venezuelan Embassy in Managua 
this afternoon (local time), allegedly as a pressure tactic for 
social and economic benefits from the administration of Violeta 
Chamorro. 
  Initial reports indicate the occupiers, former Government 
Ministry employees, were unarmed when they entered the embassy, 
which is located approximately 10 km south of Managua in the 
luxurious sector of Sierras de Santo Domingo. 
  Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesmen say they have not 
received official information regarding the occupation, and 
Venezuelan Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant has not disclosed the 
demands of the former soldiers. 
  Dozens of policemen have been deployed to the area 
surrounding the Venezuelan Embassy.

  [Text] Madrid, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Cesar Gaviria, the Colombian 
president and OAS secretary general-elect, believes the best way 
to propitiate a change in Cuba is to maintain an open dialogue 
with Fidel Castro's regime. In an interview published today, 
Sunday, in the Spanish daily LA VANGUARDIA, Gaviria says that he 
does not believe it is convenient "to pressure" the Cuban 
Government and that it is best to help the Caribbean country 
change its economy. 
  "What we can look into as a possibility--but I do not know 
if 
Castro will go along with it--is to work along the lines 
followed by Spain, Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico in the past, 
keeping open the channels for dialogue and technical 
cooperation," he said. "We have to assess the situation to see 
if we can help Cuba change its economy," "with technical support 
and without subsidies or attempts to alleviate its economic 
situation," the Colombian president explained. 
  The Colombian president believes Cuba has progressed in the 
economic sector during the past months "in a direction that 
could be described as correct." He said, however, the 
international community "is a bit impatient and would like 
political changes to take place more swiftly." Asked if he 
believed Cuba could achieve democracy with Castro in power, 
Gaviria replied: "As long as changes in Cuba continue in an 
orderly manner, the possibilities that will allow for a gradual 
change are important." 
  Regarding the scheduled Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena 
de 
Indias on 14 and 15 June, Gaviria said it will basically be 
geared toward the exchange of economic, commercial, and 
investment experiences, bearing in mind the ongoing processes of 
integration. As in previous summits, the one in Cartagena will 
serve, according to the Colombian president, to strengthen 
cultural, linguistic, and economic ties between Latin America 
and Spain and Portugal. "Relations with Spain and Portugal have 
helped us extend an important bridge to the European Union," 
Gaviria told the Barcelonan newspaper. According to Gaviria, 
Ibero-American summits are very useful to the Cuban Government, 
because it listens to the experiences of the rest of the Latin 
American countries at those meetings and gathers "useful 
teachings." 
  Gaviria said that with the death of drug trafficker Pablo 
Escobar, Colombia has left behind "the worst part of 
narcoterrorism" and shown that no criminal organization, 
regardless of how powerful it is, can challenge the state. The 
Colombia president attributes the violence in Colombia to the 
traditional weakness of the government and the administration of 
justice. "Violence comes from the past century. We have always 
had very high levels of violence," he said. "The main factor is 
not only poverty and the lack of policemen, but also inadequate 
justice," he added.

  Flanked by Hugo Fernandez Faingold and Heber Gatto, 
Sanguinetti and Batalla each delivered a short speech on the 
agreement's implications to an audience of more than 100 people, 
including leaders and experts from both movements. [passage

  Sanguinetti said: "What nurtures this agreement is a 
reflection and an analysis of the country and its future." 
  He added that it was with this objective in mind that he 
started to negotiate with Sen. Hugo Batalla, and stated that he 
was confident that talks would be brought to a successful 
conclusion in the coming weeks. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa have announced the creation of a team 
of advisers and foreign consultants to coordinate the 
internationalization of Chile, either through NAFTA or through 
the signing a free trade bilateral agreement with the United 
States (TLC). 
  A delegation of five specialists, headed by Ricardo Vicuna, 
will go to Washington tomorrow to begin the first technical 
analysis with experts from the U.S. Department of Commerce. For 
four or five days, they will discuss Chapter 11 of the NAFTA 
agreement regarding investments, the content of the agreements 
proposed by the United States, and the Chilean foreign 
investments system -- particularly Decree Law 600. [passage 
omitted] 
  During yesterday's news conference, the ministers announced 
the names of the 21 permanent advisers and foreign consultants 
who will head the NAFTA negotiations. The following are the 
close advisers of Aninat who belong to the team: Andrea 
Butelmann, Jorge Kaufmann, Joaquin Vial, Maria E. Wagner, and 
Ricardo Vicuna, who heads the mission to Washington for 
technical consultations. Liselott Kana of the Foreign 
Investments Committee, Oscar Landerretche of the Economy 
Ministry, and Gloria Pena of the Central Bank are also members 
of the team. 
  The foreign advisers are: Vittorio Corbo, Andres Velasco, 
Ricardo Katz, Felipe Larrain, Antonia Silva, Blas Tomic, Esteban 
Tomic, Jaime Undurraga, Augusto Aninat, Juan Gabriel Valdes, Lia 
Venezian, Josefina Vial, and Maximiliano Cox. 
  As the various stages in the negotiations are reached, 
experts of the Foreign, Agriculture, and Labor Ministries and 
the secretary general of the Presidency will join the team. 
[passage omitted] 
  Minister Aninat admitted having made a mistake when he 
estimated that a draft agreement regarding NAFTA or a bilateral 
agreement would be ready by late March 1995: "I would say it was 
an erroneous estimate, a bit tight, but you must admit one 
thing: All sectors started discussing the meaning of NAFTA and 
we believe, in our capacity as government, that it was necessary 
for all sectors to open their eyes and start to learn about such 
an important issue." 
  Aninat refused to predict a date for a final agreement 
although he said he thought it would take less than the two and 
a half years it took Mexico, Canada, and the United States.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Chilean Foreign 
Minister Carlos Figueroa presented Chile's formal proposal to 
Argentine authorities to join the Common Market of the South 
(Mercosur) as an "independent partner." 
  Figueroa expressed Chile's "firm decision" to increase its 
economic ties with the rest of Latin America, a step that "is 
not incompatible" with its attempt to join NAFTA, which 
comprises the United States, Canada, and Mexico. 
  During a news conference in which he was joined by Argentine 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Figueroa explained that Chile 
proposed measures to gradually deregulate the trade of goods, 
services, and investments between Chile and the Mercosur 
partners. 
  Figueroa stressed that Mercosur, to which Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay belong, "is an extremely clear opportunity 
to export Chilean manufactured goods of high added value." 
  Figueroa pointed out that Chile seeks to join, as an 
"observer," Mercosur's dozen or so "working groups," which 
establish the trade and economic policies that the four partners 
of the regional integration agreement must implement. 
  Di Tella, as the Mercosur "pro tempore" secretary 
(coordination chief), received Chile's formal proposal. He 
stressed that Chile "has animated" the regional integration 
agreement's partners. The Argentine foreign minister 
emphasized: "It represents a very significant step because from 
now on the great political and economic advancements among the 
American Southern Cone countries will be even greater, like 
never before." 
  Di Tella noted that Bolivia is the other Southern Cone 
country that has shown "great interest" in joining Mercosur, 
whose full implementation is scheduled for 1995. The Argentine 
foreign minister said "it would be ideal" to reach an agreement 
on Chile's entry next year. 
  Carlos Figueroa denied that the Chilean entry proposal had 
been received with distrust by Uruguay, whose foreign minister, 
Sergio Abreu, "was one of the most animated." 
  The Mercosur foreign ministers received a preliminary 
Chilean 
proposal during the OAS General Assembly that met for two days 
in the Brazilian city of Belem do Para. 
  The Chilean foreign minister refused to supply more details 
on the proposal because "it must be reviewed" by the Mercosur 
partners. 
  Figueroa pointed out that Chile's interest in joining stems 
from Mercosur's economic potential and its negotiating power 
with other trade blocs, especially the EU. Figueroa said the 
Chilean proposal follows agreements with the Latin American 
Integration Association (ALADI) and the Brazilian proposal to 
establish a regional free trade zone. 
  The Chilean foreign minister is scheduled to meet tomorrow 
with Argentine and Chilean entrepreneurs who have invested in 
Argentina.

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Jorge Pinto Mazal, Mexican 
deputy secretary of foreign relations, has said, here, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba will 
strengthen ties between both countries and create new 
opportunities for Mexican investments on the island. 
  The Mexican diplomat has announced Salinas will meet with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro and members of the Cuban Councils 
of State and Ministers on 13 June. 
  Salinas will reaffirm the friendly and fraternal ties 
between 
Mexico and the Cuban people. We are neighboring countries 
sharing the same cultural values," Pinto Mazal said in an 
interview with NOTIMEX. [no opening quotation mark as received] 
  He added the principles guiding Mexico's foreign policy were 
reinforced with a negotiated [words indistinct] solution for the 
Haitian crisis and the proposals to end Cuba's isolation 
presented by Canada and Brazil. "We are very pleased to see 
other countries share that position and do not want to see Cuba 
isolated," he said. 
  Pinto is participating in the 24th OAS General Assembly in 
Belem, the capital of the Brazilian State of Para, which will 
end 10 June. 
  Pinto has said the flow of Mexican tourists as well as 
Mexican investments in Cuba have increased considerably. He 
added that the Mexican Government and investors view Cuba as a 
"suitable" place for investments under the current commercial 
conditions which attract investments to the island. He said the 
National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext) views Cuba as a safe 
country for Mexican capital. 
  According to a Bancomext report, there is a "favorable 
[words 
indistinct] worldwide tendencies "is a situation" that 
encourages a greater volume of business activities between 
Mexico and Cuba. 
  During the past five years, small- and medium-size Mexican 
investors have shown interest in exploiting the Cuban market and 
obtaining a clear knowledge of the facilities offered by 
Castro's government for foreign investments, particularly from 
Latin America. 
  Based on figures released by the Cuban Government, trade 
between both countries totals approximately $200 million, a 
figure that has increased in the past few years. 
  During the morning session of the 24th OAS General Assembly, 
Brazil and Canada proposed an end to Cuba's isolation [word 
indistinct] a mechanism to promote the "democratic transition" 
that "can already be seen" on the Caribbean island. 
  "We are all expecting a democratic change in Cuba, a country 
with which Brazil maintains friendly relations," Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said during the assembly. 
  Amorin said positive actions can be perceived in the Cuban 
reforms, which "should be strengthened." He ruled out, however, 
economic and political isolation as the best way to contribute 
to encouraging that transition, which was "already initiated." 
  In her speech, Christine Stewart, Canadian secretary of 
state 
for Latin American affairs, said her country believes that "due 
to its nature, isolation is unhealthy, especially at this 
important time of transition for Cuba." 
  "It is in our interest and that of the Cuban people for us 
to 
support the process of transition taking place on the island, a 
transition which is positive and orderly," Stewart said. 
  The official said the Canadian Government is evaluating new 
steps to intensify dialogue with the Cuban authorities. "We 
believe it is important for the OAS and Cuba to examine how to 
bring about the founding fathers' vision of [words indistinct] 
inter-American organization for hemispheric participation," the 
Canadian representative added. 
  "Cuba is part of that vision," Stewart added while demanding 
the [words indistinct] in the debate about its possible 
readmittance into the inter-American system. 
  The foreign ministers have been participating in the OAS 
General Assembly since 6 June and up until [words indistinct] in 
this city located approximately 2,000 km north of Brasilia.

  [Text] Canada plans to announce before the month's end the 
lifting of the aid embargo imposed on Cuba 16 years ago, when 
Cuban troops gave their internationalist help to Angola. 
Canadian Government sources in Ottawa have said that Christine 
Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and Africa, will 
make the announcement during an economic conference in Havana on 
20 June. Canadian aid will not be between governments but will 
consist of assistance to nongovernmental organizations that work 
in Cuba. 
  The Canadian Government gave approximately $576,000 in 
urgent 
assistance to humanitarian organizations in Cuba last year, 
including the Red Cross. Ottawa never broke diplomatic 
relations even though it suspended all governmental aid to 
Havana in 1978. The same source stated that the lifting of the 
aid embargo on Cuba has been generally well received.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pedro Manuel Otero, from Cartagena </F>
de Indias, Colombia; from the "First Thing" program] 
  [Text] Colombian President Cesar Gaviria will host 20 of 
his Ibero-American counterparts in Cartagena de Indias on 14 
June. He will conclude his term in August, after almost five 
years as head of the Colombian Government. This man has carried 
out social security plans, enforced efficient strategies in the 
struggle against the drug cartels, and sponsored an active 
foreign policy that put the country in a leading position at the 
continental level. Colombia comprises -- along with Venezuela 
and Mexico -- the active Group of Three. 
  Gaviria's role undoubtedly resulted in his appointment as 
OAS 
secretary general, replacing Joao Baena Soares at the end of his 
term. Colombian citizens breathed easier with Gaviria because 
he virtually dismantled the dangerous Medellin Cartel and 
carried out other actions to improve public safety. His 
government also adopted important decisions in the foreign 
policy sector, including the decision to restore diplomatic 
relations with Cuba in October 1993. 
  Bilateral relations have increased since then. Four 
Colombian ministers have travelled to the island and a similar 
number of Cuban officials have visited Santa Fe de Bogota in 
less than eight months. The exchange in the trade and technical 
sectors and the search for investments in Havana have played a 
prominent role. Innumerable Colombian foreign trade delegations 
and businessmen have visited socialist Cuba. The two countries 
have participated in scientific and technological projects and 
carried out important negotiations in the pharmaceutical and 
metalworks industries and in the agricultural and perishable 
consumer goods sectors. 
  Colombia received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on 
12 December, meeting President Gaviria, Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin, and numerous businessmen during his three-day official 
visit. He also established the groundwork for creating a 
binational commission. Carlos Lage, Council of Ministers vice 
president, and Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez arrived in 
Santa Fe de Bogota after that first official Cuban visit to 
Colombia. Colombian Health Minister Juan Carlos Londono and 
Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule also visited Havana. 
  An unpleasant incident occurred in the interim: A newspaper 
in Santa Fe de Bogota tried to present Cuba as a sponsor of a 
guerrilla summit in Havana. The anti-Cuban campaign coincided 
with the announcement that Colombia would sell Cuba 
15,000-20,000 barrels of oil. The incident was finally cleared 
up, the newspaper apologized to Cuba, the case was closed, and 
the rhythm of relations resumed. 
  Ernesto Melendez, minister for foreign relations and 
economic 
cooperation, arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota, while the Colombian 
agriculture minister arrived in Havana. Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin also visited the Cuban capital, meeting President Fidel 
Castro and other high-ranking leaders. 
  Incidentally, Fidel Castro's upcoming visit to Cartagena de 
Indias to attend the fourth Ibero-American summit will be the 
second time that Castro has visited Colombia as head of state, 
the first being in August 1993 after he attended President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's inauguration in Bolivia.

  [Text] The 24th OAS General Assembly today continued 
hearing requests for Cuba's reintegration into that regional 
organization, from which it was separated in 1962 because of its 
political differences with the United States. On the second day 
of sessions in Belem do Para, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim spoke of Cuba's reintegration into the OAS Assembly and 
insisted on the need to reevaluate Cuba's situation within the 
hemispheric community. Outgoing OAS President Joao Baena Soares, 
as well as Brazilian President Itamar Franco, recommended during 
last night's inaugural meeting that Cuba's reintegration be 
studied. This topic was not on the agenda of the meeting, which 
will conclude on 10 June.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Mario Rivera and Marta Moreno from </F>
the NTV newscast] 
  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited Central Army 
units. Raul Castro was accompanied by Commander of the 
Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del 
Toro, and other high-ranking FAR officers and representatives of 
the peoples and political organizations. 
  In the morning, Raul and his delegation met Division Gen. 
Joaquin Quintas Sola at Central Army headquarters. The FAR 
minister and his delegation first laid a wreath in honor of the 
militia leaders who died in combat during the Bay of Pigs attack: 
  [Begin Quintas recording] We are honored today with a visit 
to this Central Army territory, including parts of Matanzas and 
Villa Clara Provinces. [end recording] 
  Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba 
in Matanzas, gave a briefing on the province's economic, 
political, and social situation. Garcia stressed key 
accomplishments and highlighted difficulties encountered in some 
economic activities and the efforts that are being made to move 
forward. 
  Colonel Alberto Cabrera Valdez, second chief of staff of the 
province, gave a briefing on combat preparation and readiness, 
conservation of equipment and weapons, evaluating the defensive 
readiness and awareness of the population, and the development 
of the self-sufficiency program. Cabrera emphasized the work 
being carried out in Varadero, Limonar, and Cienaga 
Municipalities to attain the second-level defensive readiness 
condition. 
  The evening was dedicated to visiting people's tunnels, 
caves 
readied for defense, and larger fortified constructions, from 
which an active defense is guaranteed. The visitors were also 
able to ascertain how activities are carried out in one of these 
command stations. Living and working conditions are assured in 
these facilities, no matter how difficult they may be. The 
delegation also visited a high security area in which an 
artillery unit is located. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del 
Toro stressed the need to preserve and improve this type of 
facility. 
  Another visit of interest was made to the (?espirulina) 
plant, a microseaweed that allows the production of high-protein 
food supplements that, in tablet form, can be used by soldiers 
under any circumstances. This microseaweed has proved that it 
works to combat illnesses, such as optic neuritis. 
  Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida Bosque asked about 
the plant's investments, the cost, number of workers, and the 
conditions under which this production takes place. 
  Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young 
Communists, stated that over 50 percent of the plant workers are 
young and have intermediate-level schooling. 
  There is no doubt after visiting these Central Army units 
that this area's protection is assured and that the FAR members 
and the population work intensively to assure that this is so. 
  [Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish at 1100 GMT on 8 
June reports during its regularly scheduled "First Thing" 
program that Raul Castro's delegation visited the "No. 2 Citrus 
Farm," in Jaguey Grande, and met Agriculture Minister Alfredo 
Jordan, Matanzas Province leaders, citrus farm representatives, 
and chiefs of the Youth Labor Army's (EJT) 102d Division. The 
report adds that the officials "agreed to convert the citrus 
farm, considered among the world's largest, into the EJT 
integral farm mode, whose efficiency has been proved in the area 
and other parts of the country."]

  [Text] The U.S. Government decision to withdraw the radars 
used for the detection of drug traffickers' light planes 
entering Peru and Colombia created discontent and uncertainty in 
different political circles. 
  Legislators said the United States must assume its share of 
responsibility for the U.S. market's influence on drug 
trafficking activities in the region. 
  Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval 
(NM-C90) [New Majority-Change 90] said it is difficult to 
explain why the country that consumes most of the drugs cannot 
take adequate measures to help producer nations. 
  "The issue is not how to resolve the problem in the United 
States but how to prevent our countries from producing the drug. 
We need all possible help for this struggle. It is inconsistent 
to withdraw the radars," Sandoval said. 
  The legislator stressed the importance of military 
operations 
to capture planes carrying drugs, which was possible precisely 
because of the support provided by those radars. 
  Sandoval said, however, that the radars are owned by the 
United States and the country has the right to withdraw them. 
  Concerning the report in Washington saying that the Peruvian 
Government has forbidden the entry of U.S. warplanes in our air 
space in answer to the radars' withdrawal, the legislator said 
the information was based on an unconfirmed press report. 
  Sandoval said Peru can take measures to make the U.S. 
Government understand that its cooperation is necessary. 
  "We are a very poor country to assume all the responsibility 
for a shared problem. The United States is also responsible. If 
it were not for the millions of consumers in that country our 
region would not produce as much drugs," Sandoval stressed. 
<H5>  Agreements Must Be Respected </H5>
  Congressman Luis Enrique Tord (CD) [Democratic Coordinating 
Group] expressed surprise at the international treatment of an 
issue that concerns the entire world community, as is the case 
of drug enforcement. Tord said decisions made by governments on 
the issue must be consistent with their representatives' 
speeches. 
  Tord said more efforts are needed to control and dominate 
the 
scourge, and the United States should cooperate in this struggle 
with high technology. 
  Tord said the agreement for the installation and operation 
of 
radars in support of the Air Force to control the entry of drug 
traffickers' light planes into our territory should be respected. 
  The congressman added that the United States must clearly 
define its policies to support Peru. 
  "Peru must continuously remind the U.S. Government about the 
need to fulfill these types of agreements, which are closed 
after complex political and military conversations," the 
legislator stressed. 
  Regarding the downing of planes, which is opposed by U.S. 
authorities, Tord said the matter involves military, technical, 
and political decisions that must be reviewed. 
<H5>  Not Too Friendly Attitude </H5>
  Congressman Henry Pease (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement] 
characterized the gesture of withdrawing the radars installed in 
Peru and Colombia without previous warning as not too friendly. 
The radars helped control the movement of planes carrying drugs 
in accordance with the drug enforcement agreement signed with 
the United States. 
  "Our Foreign Ministry should take the initiative in these 
and 
other matters to improve our relations and to prevent small 
conflicts from affecting our drug enforcement effort, which 
should be a priority for the country," Pease said. 
  In his opinion, Peru must demand fulfillment and take the 
initiative to fulfill what has been signed by the two 
governments. 
  Regarding the Peruvian decision to forbid the entry of U.S. 
AWACS and P-3 planes, Pease said the Air Force has the 
responsibility to watch over the national territory.

  [Text] Peruvian Air Force [FAP] spokesmen have asserted 
that there is no express ban on U.S. Air Force "AWACS" and 
"Orion" planes overflying Peruvian territory, as was stated in 
U.S. press reports. 
  The reports state that the alleged measure is a Peruvian 
"reprisal" to the U.S. decision to suspend the supply of 
information collected by these aircraft which is very necessary 
for the FAP to intercept traffickers' planes. 
  The consulted sources stated that the problem is simply that 
the U.S. South Command has not requested permission to enter 
Peruvian airspace. 
  Under international laws, no country can prohibit air 
traffic 
over its territory. All that is necessary is to request a permit 
and to state the route that will be followed. 
  The sources stated that the antinarcotic agreement, the part 
concerning the FAP, is still in force and this is why the radar 
sent by the Panama-based U.S. South Command is still in 
Yurimaguas. Although this radar is obsolete, whenever it is not 
out of order it is of some help to the Tucano aircraft in 
intercepting traffickers' planes. 
  FAP spokesmen admitted that the "electronic intelligence" 
supplied by U.S. "AWACS" and "Orion" is of vital importance for 
the interdiction operations against traffickers' planes and 
without their participation the Air Force's operations would not 
be as effective.

  [Text] Peru will continue to fight illegal drug trafficking 
as originally planned, despite the virtual decision by the U.S. 
Government to end the supply of information obtained by radar on 
the alleged air transportation of drugs. 
  This comment was made yesterday by General Arnaldo Velarde 
Ramirez, retired, the Peruvian representative before the 
Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse 
(CICAD) of the OAS, who said there is no official report from 
the U.S. Government on this issue. 
  He added: "All we know is of a decision by the U.S. Defense 
Department, which is not the official position of the U.S. 
Government." 
  Velarde said the lack of information on narcoplanes over 
Peruvian territory hurts drug enforcement considerably "but the 
government's political will is very strong. Peru will continue 
to fight trafficking with or without this information by using 
its own capabilities." 
  Velarde labeled the U.S. decision as unilateral and 
temporary, adding that it is "probably a decision made by the 
U.S. Defense Department."

  [Excerpt] The recent arrest of several Shining Path [SL] 
leaders has alerted the antiterrorist forces to a new and 
powerful organization within the unruly Red Path [Sendero Rojo] 
faction of the SL organization which has for some time planned 
and directed subversive actions in Lima. 
  The new SL organ, called Lima-Regional Committee [Comite 
Lima-Regional] has become the strongest political-military SL 
sector in Lima. The Lima-Regional Committee is the result of the 
merging of the Peoples' Aid [Socorro Popular] and the 
Metropolitan Committee, both of which are SL groups that 
operated in Lima. 
  The National Counterterrorism Directorate (Dincote) has 
announced that the new group is responsible for numerous cases 
of murder and terrorist actions in Lima these past few months. 
  Among them are the recent attacks against City Hall, the Air 
Force headquarters, and the U.S. Embassy as well as the murder 
of neighborhood leaders and members of the Peruvian National 
Police. 
  Dincote believes the new committee is one of the most 
powerful the SL has throughout the country, although it is 
unaware of its real operating capacity. 
  The police know the group is headed by a collegiate 
leadership. SL members arrested by Dincote have said the Lima 
Regional leadership comprises: Jenny Rodriguez Neyra, aka Rita; 
Ostap Morote Barrionuevo, aka Luis; Maritza Infante Yupanqui, 
aka Milagros; Abdon Cruzat Cardenas; and two other unidentified 
terrorists. 
  The first information about the group was disclosed by an SL 
member arrested by Dincote in May 1993. Until then the police 
were unaware of the Lima-Regional Committee's existence. 
  An SL member identified as Guillermo Pflucker Ruiz, whose 
alias is Raul according to his police records, said the Peoples' 
Aid and the Lima Metropolitan Committee united their weakened 
force following the arrest of Abimael Guzman and several other 
SL leaders. 
  It seems the harsh blows sustained by the SL's military and 
political structure forced the merger because the two sectors 
had been seriously affected by the police action. 
  By late 1992, the Peoples' Aid and the Lima Metropolitan 
Committee had lost their main leaders and their operation 
capacity had been seriously affected. 
  With the merge the SL has maintained, although at a 
significantly lower level, its capacity and presence in Lima 
through its criminal actions. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Armando Calderon Sol in San </F>
Salvador via satellite by announcer Jacobo Zabludovsky at the 
XEW Television studios in Mexico City; from the "24 Hours" 
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Zabludovsky] Thank you, Mr. President, for agreeing 
to this interview. As you complete your third week in office, 
what do you think the main challenge for your government will be? 
  [Calderon Sol] The main challenge I face is national 
reconstruction -- the reconstruction of the country. After 
overcoming the violence and destruction of the war, we must now 
move into the phase of rebuilding the nation. 
  This does not only include the material reconstruction 
effort, but also the moral and spiritual reconstruction. We 
must affirm the state of law, guarantee justice, and ensure the 
authority of the law. We must seek mutual respect among all 
people. We have just been through 12 long years of 
institutionalized violence in this country, and therefore our 
efforts must be directed at changing the people's ideas, 
conceptions, and attitudes toward effective law enforcement. 
This is an enormous task, but we are sure we will be successful 
in rebuilding El Salvador, both physically and morally. 
  [Zabludovsky] You promised to fulfill the peace agreements 
to 
the letter. Now that there is a new timetable, how do you 
expect to deal with the situation? 
  [Calderon Sol] President Cristiani wanted to clear his desk, 
as he put it, before he left office, and therefore he 
rescheduled the agreements in order to have specific dates for 
what was still pending. The new timetable is very specific, and 
I will comply with it to the letter. 
  It is my political determination to complete the peace 
process. The peace agreements are truly a national commitment, 
and I am willing to meet that commitment faithfully. The 
rescheduling will make it easier to comply within the new 
deadlines. We have said time and time again that we will 
fulfill the peace agreements, because they ensure the social 
peace and political stability that we long for in El Salvador. 
  [Zabludovsky] The civil war caused thousands of deaths and 
brought destruction and bitterness. What do you think needs to 
be done in El Salvador to prevent another civil war? 
  [Calderon Sol] Our civil war had so very much to do with the 
international situation. Our war became an international 
affair. Please remember that El Salvador, as was true for the 
rest of Central America, lived the end of the Cold War and the 
East-West struggle. Remember that El Salvador became a bastion 
of Cuban aggression in Central America. This is a tangible, 
clear, and undeniable fact demonstrated by the shipments of 
weapons -- thousands of tons of them -- that flowed into Central 
America during the bipolar Cold War. Thank goodness all this is 
over now. 
  This, of course, does not mean there were no other problems. 
There are problems even now, and there will always be problems, 
such as poverty, for example. Poverty is worse now than in the 
past, because the war brought more poverty with it. Today's 
challenge is to rebuild, produce, and develop the nation while 
promoting human advancement. That is what lies ahead. Now that 
the war is behind us and the pain is gone, let us make El 
Salvador that country we all dream and hope for. 
  [Zabludovsky] Would you like to add anything more, Mr. 
President? 
  [Calderon Sol] Mr. Zabludovsky, it is a real pleasure to 
chat 
with you, especially knowing that thousands of Salvadorans are 
watching your program, and not only in Mexico -- that wonderful 
country of yours -- but also in the United States, Canada, and 
so many other countries in which this prestigious program is 
broadcast. It is truly a pleasure to address the thousands of 
Salvadorans who live abroad and work day and night to provide 
for their families and send a little something home to build a 
better future for El Salvador. Soon all of these families will 
be reunited. 
  Let me say this to the thousands Salvadorans living away 
from 
the fatherland: We are working to allow you to come home to a 
new El Salvador. Let me also say that you have a government and 
a president who think about you all of the time, hoping for the 
reunification of the Salvadoran family.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD) proposed several measures today to 
resolve the crisis triggered by the 16 May elections, which the 
PRD maintains were fraudulent, to the Central Electoral Board 
(JCE). 
  The PRD's measures range from holding new elections, in 
which 
all political parties will participate, to holding elections at 
the most conflicting voting tables. 
  PRD leader Jose Francisco Pena Gomez requested an honest 
count of void and contested (embargoed) votes and an explanation 
of the evident inclusion of voters from the ruling Social 
Christian Reformist Party (PRSC), which is affiliated with the 
"Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance. These voters allegedly voted 
with only their personal identification and electoral numbers. 
  He also recommended determining the difference between the 
number of voters included on the voting lists delivered to the 
political parties and the number of voters included on those 
lists delivered to the electoral tables by the JCE and to 
investigate the alleged exclusion of voters. 
  Pena suggested that independent, national, and foreign 
technicians advise the JCE on computer operations and that 
civilian society and Catholic Church personalities help in the 
count. The PRD leader urged Electoral Tribunal judges "to 
reestablish the original resolve of the Dominican people." 
  The leader of the PRD and "Santo Domingo Accord" Alliance 
maintained that other ways to respect the people's resolve 
"while reestablishing the only truth that emerged from the 16 
May elections" could include holding new elections with the 
participation of all political parties. 
  Pena said complementary elections could be held where it is 
proven a large number of voters could not cast their votes. He 
added, however, "the PRSC personal identification card factory 
will have to be closed" in order to meet this goal. 
  He accentuated his allegation of fraud during the 16 May 
elections, thereby noting the country is facing an "electoral 
coup d'etat" to curtail the Dominican people's right to freely 
elect their rulers. 
  The Dominican Republic has immersed itself in endless 
arguments and accusations of fraud, which are keeping the 
country bogged in economic uncertainty and a suspension of such 
productive activities as tourism and free zones.

  [Text] To avoid genocide in Haiti, it is urgent the United 
Nations send the Dominican Republic the list of food products 
not included in the embargo. This is the position expressed on 7 
June by Dominican Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral. 
In his opinion, the complete closing of the border between the 
two countries is speeding up an imposed, strategic genocide 
within Haitian society. 
  Cabral also complains that he has not yet received the list 
promised about one week ago by Dante Caputo. The deputy foreign 
minister also pointed out that he does not know the date on 
which to expect the mission of 60 UN observers who have agreed 
to help with surveillance of the border area.

  [Text] President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide issued a 
call at the OAS General Assembly for the international community 
to take quick and decisive action to oust the military that 
overthrew him in September 1991. Quick and decisive action is 
needed to dislodge those responsible for the coup d'etat in the 
framework of the Governors Island Agreement, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide told the OAS General Assembly in Brazil. I will not 
waste time describing this action since the international 
community knows what it is, the president-in-exile said without 
explicitly mentioning military intervention. 
  OAS international mediator Dante Caputo believes this crisis 
can be solved peacefully and in a few weeks. He thinks we do 
not face a whole year, stating that it would be necessary to 
issue a diplomatic ultimatum to the military in Haiti. He 
concluded, quote, we cannot condemn an armed intervention and 
not do anything to avoid it, unquote. 
  Jean-Bertrand Aristide presented a government action program 
to be executed on his return. First, the president-in-exile 
asked for the immediate return of the UN mission in Haiti, the 
UN mission provided for in the Governors Island Agreement. I 
will return after the mission is sent and after an army and 
police reform program is introduced, he said. Once the 
government is restored, Jean-Bertrand Aristide also promises to 
collaborate with the UN mission for six months, as indicated in 
the Governors Island Agreement. At the same time, he expressed 
his willingness to reconcile Haitians with themselves, including 
the military. There will be reconciliation after democracy is 
restored in Haiti, which means peace for all, respect for each 
citizen, unity, and justice for all, he stated. The 
president-in-exile also presented a development program 
involving international aid. A country at work is a country at 
peace, assured the president-in-exile, who invited the OAS 
chancellors to meet in Haiti for the next OAS General Assembly. 
  Those were statements made by President-in-exile 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide during the the 24th OAS General Assembly 
on 6 June.

  [Excerpts] The unofficial Senate office received the 
minister of justice of the provisional government, attorney 
Louis B. Toussaint, on 7 June within the format of its planned 
consultations with officials of the new provisional government. 
Restoring the authority of the government, reforming justice, 
and reducing the cost of living will be the priorities of the 
Ministry of Justice, according to attorney Louis Toussaint, who 
also discussed the Ministry's currently meager resources. Let us 
listen to a report by Jean Luckenson. 
  [Begin recording] [Luckenson] "Within the scope of the 
series 
of meetings with the family [as heard] on 7 June, it was the 
turn of Louis B. Toussaint, justice minister of Emile 
Jonassaint's provisional government, which is not recognized by 
the international community. Toussaint, who was accompanied by 
his general director Yves Barbot and his head of cabinet, 
Jean-Claude Jean-Jacques, responded to the invitation of the 
unofficial Senate office presided over by Senator Bernard 
Sansaricq, legitimate son of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion, in the company of the contested family of 18 January 
senators. 
  ``Following the speech by Sansaricq, who is president of the 
unofficial Senate office, Senate Justice Commission president, 
Sen. Romel Manigat, drew a portrait of Haitian justice, which he 
believes is not only on crutches, but is paralyzed, in a 
five-page speech in French. He pointed an accusing finger at 
judges who he said are selling justice by caprice. In his 
speech, he congratulated and did not forget to flatter the 
provisional government's justice minister, who had been his 
teacher at the Philippe Guerrier Public High School, and at the 
Faculty of Law in Cap-Haitien, the country's second city.'' 
[passage omitted] 
  "For his part, Louis B. Toussaint thanked the president of 
the unofficial Senate office. He did not hesitate to turn the 
pages of Haitian history. He said the country finds itself today 
in the gravest moment of its history. The minister summarized 
four points on which they should work so the justice department 
can function properly to reach a state of law." [passage omitted] 
  "The justice minister said they will work to reform the 
judicial system in Haiti, although the task will not be easy. 
Toussaint launched pointed remarks while Sen. Yves Rousseau 
napped in his seat. Sen. Dupiton had a quiet laugh when 
Toussaint said that the one who had asked that 10,000 people 
rather than 7,000 enter Haiti within the scope of the UN Mission 
in Haiti [MINUHA] should be arrested. Improving salaries, 
reducing the cost of living, stabilizing the country's economy, 
and restoring the government's authority are priority points for 
the ministry he is leading. But unfortunately, he said, mud 
stops the current. It is a provisional government, not a 
definitive government." 
  [Toussaint] I heard this same individual, who pretends to be 
Haitian, saying that when they proposed to send MINUHA here with 
1,500 men, he prided himself on having answered the foreigners 
that 10,000 were needed. I heard with dread that same individual 
saying they are ready, the people are ready to receive the 
foreigners, and the Army will be absolutely helpless against the 
invasion. His words say he hopes for the invasion with all his 
heart. The duty of the Ministry of Justice would be to have this 
traitor -- I publicly call him a traitor -- arrested 
immediately, but we understand that this is just a provocation. 
  [Luckenson] "Those who were listening to the minister were 
greatly surprised because he did not speak of the cases of 
disappearances and arrests made without warrants everyday in 
both Port-au-Prince and the province cities, or of the fate of 
those who have been in jail for a long time. 
  ``We should tell you that this series of meetings began 
during the week of 23 May among members of the provisional 
government of President Emile Jonassaint and the second Senate 
office, which is not recognized by the international community. 
We must tell you that the justice minister of the provisional 
government, attorney Toussaint, is the one who was proposed as 
provisional president of the provisional government formed under 
Article 111 of the country's fundamental law, following the 
congress of the Group of Citizens of the Greater North, which 
lasted three days at the National Theater. Jean Luckenson for 
Signal FM.'' [end recording]

  [Text] The provisional government would like to keep its 
distance from the legislators who appointed it. Do not impose 
your work pace on us. We are in a special situation, involved 
in a struggle, which was lost in advance, stated Minister of the 
Interior and National Defense Willio Nouailles, who was invited 
to appear on 6 June by a group of senators. He said he wished 
the senators would give the government time to act as needed at 
this juncture. Edner Jean filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Jean] The first case discussed by the 
office of Senator Sansaricq was security, including cliches 
about corpses being devoured by pigs after having been murdered 
by armed civilians. Romel Manigat, president of the Interior and 
National Defense Commission, asked Minister Willio Nouailles 
about the executions committed by political and paramilitary 
formations as well as the overly brutal interventions by the 
agents of order, who are in some cases known to all. Another 
question raised by the commission was the measures the 
provisional government intends to take to force awareness of 
their responsibility on those who need it, in view of 
guaranteeing national sovereignty, which is being threatened. 
  Regarding the boat people, the provisional government has 
just reactivated the decree repressing clandestine trips. Is 
this a test to make Washington yield, asked Romel Manigat, whose 
election has been contested. What are the duties of the Armed 
Forces in this case, he also asked. 
  Regarding 1994 elections, the Interior and National Defense 
Commission considers that the provisional government is already 
late with its electoral agenda. Some arrangements should have 
been made before parliament reopened to proceed to an immediate 
start of the electoral process, according to the Senate led by 
Bernard Sansaricq. To all these questions, the minister of the 
interior responds that it is not a question of opening a box and 
coming out with a ready-made solution. Do not tell us what to 
do, just let us do it, he exclaimed. The minister of the 
interior of the ad hoc government further warned those 
legislators against any attempts to influence Judge Emile 
Jonassaint's policy. May each one work in the fields that he 
knows, he maintained. Moreover, Willio Nouailles added, and I 
quote: You have forced us into the ring, but please, let us act, 
let us have our own experiences. He offered a good political 
mathematics lesson to those legislators in terms of equations 
and tangents: 
  [Nouailles] It is necessary to make an equation, with at 
least eight unknowns. It is necessary to calculate intensities. 
It is necessary to make charts of variables. It is necessary to 
draw some curves. You want a muscular policy, an epidermic 
policy, a pocket policy. I indeed notice this haste, this great 
haste. Your president is a patriarch of 82 years. The pace that 
you impose on him is the kind that can break his neck. Haste is 
a bad adviser in this type of ruse. In any case, after eight 
years of drift, I would not want to see you impose on the 
provisional government the burden, all the weight, the entire 
cross of this huge, [word indistinct], tragedy. You must 
understand that this ad hoc government that you have formed 
finds itself [word indistinct] on a creation mission. 
  [Jean] Willio Nouailles thus demands more time to pursue his 
creative work. The government intends to create new democratic 
structures in the country and to take all the time necessary to 
prepare for future elections. Willio Nouailles stated before the 
Senate led by Bernard Sansaricq that the government is an ad hoc 
government, set up by an ad hoc senate for the national 
safeguard. The minister of the interior reminded them that the 
Senate was split in two and that the government did not have the 
recognition of the Chamber of Deputies. 
  Regarding the threats of foreign intervention, the minister 
of the interior and national defense said history honors us to 
fight the whole world. He added, however, one can be Dessalines 
or Capois La-Mort, but Vertieres is no longer possible in 1994. 
To the office led by Bernard Sansaricq, the minister of the 
interior and national defense exclaimed in these terms, quote: 
You have entrusted me with a battle that was lost in advance. 
Unquote. And so as not to leave room for the enemy, Willio 
Nouailles thinks he can still use the arm of dialectic. 
  [Nouailles] For a small country like Haiti, its struggle is 
dialectic, a philosophical struggle, a conceptualist struggle, a 
struggle at the level of methodology, at the analysis level. It 
is not a struggle in either open or closed fields. Even a 
guerrilla war is now impossible. 
  [Jean] In general, Willio Nouailles pleaded at length for 
the 
undertaking of power by the middle classes. In this respect, he 
praised the exploits of Dumarsais Estime and Francois Duvalier. 
Modern history makes the middle class accountable for politics 
in Haiti. He criticized the traditional bourgeoisie for having, 
according to him, formed a parallel government for the purpose 
of ruining the efforts of the provisional government. He was 
here referring to the ad interim Prime Minister Robert Malval. 
The minister of the interior and national defense further 
pointed out that it is up to the Army to determine the social 
class qualified to take power in Haiti. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] During a ceremony at List 2000 [not further 
specified] headquarters at midday on 1 June, Julio Maria 
Sanguinetti, leader of the Batlleist Forum [Colorado Party 
faction], and Senator Hugo Batalla, leader of the Party of the 
Government by the People, were presented with a document 
containing the programmatic bases of an electoral agreement 
between both political movements. 
  Flanked by Hugo Fernandez Faingold and Heber Gatto, 
Sanguinetti and Batalla each delivered a short speech on the 
agreement's implications to an audience of more than 100 people, 
including leaders and experts from both movements. [passage 
omitted] 
  Sanguinetti said: "What nurtures this agreement is a 
reflection and an analysis of the country and its future." 
  He added that it was with this objective in mind that he 
started to negotiate with Sen. Hugo Batalla, and stated that he 
was confident that talks would be brought to a successful 
conclusion in the coming weeks. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Managua, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The seizure of the 
Venezuelan Embassy in Managua, with five diplomats inside, by 23 
former Sandinist military ended today following 11 hours of 
tension and negotiations as the Nicaraguan Government pledged to 
discuss the occupiers' petitions for compensation. 
  Another group of at least 20 former military, who also 
demanded compensation for being discharged in the past four 
years, also ended the takeover of the Managua Cathedral. The 
seizure of the cathedral occurred almost at the same time and 
was also peaceful. 
  Diogenes Silva, assigned to the embassy's military attache 
office, confirmed that the former military had left and said 
that "control of the diplomatic office" had been regained. 
Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant and four other diplomats remained 
inside the embassy, which is located on the outskirts of Managua. 
  Moments later, Donald Flores -- one of the former military 
who seized the cathedral and led a similar action in 1993 -- 
also confirmed his partners had left the church. 
  Kidder Salazar, first secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy, 
told ACAN-EFE during the occupation that he and the other 
diplomats did not stay there as hostages, but to protect the 
embassy. The former military -- who were unarmed -- released 
two employees who were also at the embassy after several hours. 
  Also on Tuesday, other former military seized and occupied 
the Italian Embassy in Managua and the UN building for several 
hours. 
  Following the civil war and the demobilization of thousands 
of combatants, there were two simultaneous abductions of 
political leaders and high-ranking officials in Nicaragua last 
year. Former contras were responsible for one of the abductions 
in northern Nicaraguan while Sandinists were responsible for the 
other abduction in the capital. In 1993, another heavily armed 
anti-Sandinist command seized and occupied the Nicaraguan 
Embassy in Costa Rica for two weeks. 
  Today's occupation was solved around midnight, local time 
(0600 GMT), after Vilma Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Center 
for Human Rights, and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, of the Managua 
Archbishopric, mediated the conflict. Both assured that the 
government had agreed to begin conversations within two days 
with the former military, thereby allowing the solution of the 
cathedral's occupation. 
  A letter from Alfredo Mendieta, justice minister, to Nunez 
and Montenegro, announced that the government accepted the 
negotiation and in addition would release seven former military 
who had been arrested. In exchange, however, the minister 
demanded that the military leave "immediately the embassy and 
the cathedral." 
  In the negotiations it was agreed to create a commission to 
discuss the retired military's claims. The commission will have 
two representatives of the "Movement for a Fair and Honorable 
Compensation," Eduardo Hernandez and Adrian Calero. According 
to the government commitment, compensation will be negotiated 
for an unspecified number of retired military based on the 
October 1993 agreements. At that time the cathedral was also 
occupied by discontented former Sandinist military. Vilma Nunez 
and Monsignor Montenegro will act as mediators again in the 
negotiations. The government also accepted the diplomatic 
mission occupants' demand that no reprisals would be taken 
against members of the movement. 
  Donald Flores, leader of the former military, declared that 
he hoped that the "actions aimed at a peaceful solution" of 
their demands for compensation for their years of service, had 
concluded. 
  Nevertheless, Frank Cesar, deputy government minister, said 
before the agreement was reached, that they have no right to any 
compensation and that some of the former military "had been 
involved in criminal actions," while others already had 
collected their compensation and continue to work in government 
institutions. The official assured that the previous Sandinist 
regime had fired hundreds of military who served in the former 
Interior Ministry; the majority now are demanding compensation 
to which they have no right. He explained that in February, 785 
persons received their compensation although it appears that 
1,000 were demobilized from the Interior Ministry, the majority 
before April 1990 when Violeta Chamorro took office.

to Daniel Ortega, secretary general of the Nicaraguan Sandinist 
National Liberation Front, FSLN, dated 24 May] 
  [Text] Havana, 24 May 1994, 36th year of the revolution. 
  Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra 
  Secretary General 
  Sandinist National Liberation Front 
  Dear Daniel: 
  Allow me to express my most fraternal congratulations for 
your recent election as FSLN secretary general. 
  The special congress that recently ended was, undoubtedly, 
an 
expression of maturity, particularly of the unity preserved by 
that political organization during the most difficult stages of 
struggle through which it has historically journeyed. 
  That event blazes a path of hope for the organization in its 
continuous efforts to accomplish the objectives of genuine and 
full social justice, results to which it has committed decades 
of struggle, as well as the valuable blood of its martyrs. 
  Under international circumstances as complex as the present, 
where a unipolar world under the hegemony of the United States 
has taken shape, the will, fortitude for struggle, and faith in 
the people's victory is tested. 
  I would like to convey my congratulations to all the comrade 
delegates to the congress, the Sandinist Assembly, and the 
elected National Directorate. 
  An embrace, 
  [Signed] Fidel Castro Ruz.

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Only 50 percent of the recommendations issued by the 
National Human Rights Committee [CNDH] are in compliance. In 
light of this situation, President Salinas set a 30-day deadline 
for the government and organizations to comply with the 
recommendations. Here is a report by Jaime Guerrero: 
  [Begin recording] [Guerrero] The leading problem the CNDH 
faces is that of partial compliance with its recommendations, 
but a statement issued today at Los Pinos presidential residence 
could be interpreted as a warning. The federal government might 
apply sanctions against those who do not fully comply with CNDH 
recommendations. 
  Several governors might be among those penalized. Jorge 
Madrazo has submitted his report. Madrazo said that during the 
past four years, the CNDH issued 796 recommendations, of which 
51 percent were in partial compliance. As a result, a 30-day 
deadline was established for state governments and organizations 
to comply with CNDH recommendations. President Salinas has said 
the law will be applied to its fullest extent. 
  [Salinas] I urge state governors to join this national 
effort 
with a greater enthusiasm, and I urge the CNDH president to 
disclose, under a strict time limit, a new public report on the 
results of compliance with the recommendations. The last 
results have been referred here as negligent noncompliance. 
  [Guerrero] During the past year, the CNDH received 
approximately 9,000 complaints, of which human rights violations 
in prisons, abuse of authority, and arbitrary arrests head the 
list. Torture reportedly ranks 10th on the long list of 
violations nationwide. 
  [Madrazo] In the fight against torture, we have not had the 
resolute support of all governors or all judges. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico City, 7 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican 
Armed Forces stated they are conducting searches in Chiapas to 
prevent the traffic of weapons and explosives, denying media 
reports they had imposed "sieges" in that southeastern state. 
  "Searches are being conducted at the military checkpoints 
established in the area with the sole purpose of preventing the 
trafficking of weapons and explosives toward the conflict area," 
the National Secretariat of Defense stated. 
  The Armed Forces issued a communique to deny media reports 
they had imposed "restrictions," "sieges," and "quarantines" in 
an area where the conflict that began on 1 January is being 
resolved. 
  The Zapatist National Liberation Army concluded the first 
phase of a reconciliation dialogue with Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, on 1 March. 
  The dialogue took place amid a virtual truce in San 
Cristobal 
de las Casas, 200 km southeast of Mexico City, following the 
unilateral cease-fire ordered by President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari on 12 January. 
  The communique revealed that "the National Secretariat of 
Defense stated categorically" that since the unilateral 
cease-fire, the Armed Forces "have and will continue to 
facilitate" the transit of residents, goods, and medical 
attention.

<F P=106> [Report by Ricardo Olayo] </F>
  [Text] The Attorney General's Office (PGR) has reported 
that in the current year it has seized 60,000 rounds of small 
arms ammunition of various calibers. The quantity seized is 
double that seized -- 28,397 rounds -- during the period 
December 1988 to December 1993, according to the institution. 
  The two most recent PGR operations took place between 28 May 
and 4 June, in which its personnel managed to seize more than 
28,544 rounds of ammunition in several actions in the country. 
Both reports indicate that Nogales, Sonora, is where the PGR 
has arrested the most gunrunners. 
  During the operations, which were conducted over the period 
of a week, PGR personnel managed to seize almost as many rounds 
of ammunition as were seized during the past 61 months of the 
current government administration. 
  Statistics provided by the Deputy Attorney General's Office 
for Delegations and Inspection Units [Subprocuraduria de 
Delegaciones y Visitaduria] also show that during the current 
year, 537 weapons and approximately 800 vehicles were seized 
from alleged criminals; many of them linked to drug trafficking 
activities. The weapons seized have been detected at road 
checkpoints (precos), airports, and during investigations of 
drug trafficking groups. 
  Regarding the entry of weapons and ammunition into the 
country, the PGR has reported that the corresponding 
investigations are under way to learn the origin and destination 
of the shipments, as well as the identity of the persons 
involved. In most cases, the PGR has not revealed the names of 
the alleged criminals so as not to hinder the investigations. 
  PGR statistics establish that it has seized 60,156 rounds of 
ammunition during the period 1 January-5 June 1994. Up to a 
few days ago, the PGR had seized 31,712 cartridges. In its two 
most recent operations, however, the PGR seized 28,544 rounds, 
thus, increasing the amount to more than 60,000 live rounds. 
  The largest amount of ammunition was seized during the week 
of 28 May, when 18,385 rounds were impounded and three persons 
were arrested during the two operations carried out in Jalisco 
and Tamaulipas. Later, the PGR seized a shipment of 9,400 
rounds loaded on a van with California State license plates, at 
the 49-km marker on the Jalisco-Nogales international highway. 
  PGR members also managed to impound a shipment of 7,676 
rounds of various calibers and seven weapons last week. The 
shipment was being transported by Ramon Isordia Pedroza and Jose 
Zepeda Mora and was discovered at the 21-km checkpoint on the 
Hermosillo-Nogales international highway.

<F P=106> [Article by Jose Arnada] </F>
  [Text] The Secretariat of National Defense (Sedna), as part 
of its modernization plan during this 6-year administration, 
purchased from 1989 to June this year, 2,321 Hummer vehicles, 60 
combat trucks, 1,307 diverse vehicles, 38 transportation and 
training planes, as well as 26 riot units. 
  According to official information, in order to equip their 
"operations with greater efficiency," the institution purchased 
in 1993, 260 Hummers -- a purchase that caused a storm -- 1,471 
vehicles, 549 machine guns, approximately 29,000 grenades of 
diverse types, and 2,478 grenade launchers for automatic rifles. 
  In addition, to guarantee the timely supply of weapons to 
the 
Armed Forces and furnish support to its security forces, the 
defense industry in 1993 manufactured 70.8 percent more 
equipment than in 1992. A total of 1,725 automatic rifles, 164 
machine guns, 1,640 light machine guns, and 3,390 automatic 
pistols were manufactured. 
  The Armed Forces have earmarked a 5.493 billion-new-peso 
budget. This amount is equal to the health sector's budget for 
this year, although it is less than the Secretariat of National 
Education's -- approximately 24 billion new pesos -- and that of 
the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, with 
approximately 11 billion pesos. 
  Sedna reported that the Weapons' Unification Program 
achieved 
"significant progress" in 1993 by incorporating the functional 
reuse of rifles and light automatic rifles. This allowed the 
weapons supply for operational units in Military Regions 2, 4, 
5, 8, 9, and 10 to be supplemented. 
  In addition, the current updating of the Army and Air Forces 
strategic plans has resulted in improved operational control and 
coordination of the diverse territorial mandates and military 
units. This includes air as well as land forces. 
  In 1993, the Army's regional deployment was reorganized with 
the creation of the 37th Military Zone, the jurisdictional 
restructuring of Military Region 1 and of the 1st and 22d 
Military Zones. This has enhanced the operational coordination 
of the units assigned to these zones. 
  According to the National Development Program, "the great 
national tasks" require the participation of the Army, the Navy, 
and the Air Force. 
  In addition to its "primary responsibility" -- the defense 
of 
the nation -- the Armed Forces must participate in the overall 
development of the nation. This is accomplished by safeguarding 
democratic institutions and protecting natural resources and the 
strategic installations for security and the nation's economy. 
  The plan holds that in terms of political issues, the Army's 
mission is to defend the principles of sovereignty and 
nationalism, respect for liberty, support for democracy, the 
rejection of intervention, and defense of the peoples' right to 
self-determination. 
  With regard to the economic sector, it will support the 
nation's overall development. In the social sector, the Army 
will share the commitment to raise the people's level of 
well-being. 
  The document highlights that for the Army "to accomplish its 
missions with greater efficiency," permanent revamping of its 
organization, equipment, and military capabilities will be 
necessary. 
  When Antonio Riviello Bazan, national defense secretary, 
recently referred to the purchase of military equipment, he 
assured that the riot units and the Hummer vehicles had been 
ordered "some time back." These, he said, will be used "solely 
for defense," within the limits outlined by "the law on respect 
for human rights."

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has stated 
that it is unfair for the incoming administration to have to pay 
for the current government's inability to meet its obligations 
with the international financial institutions [IFI's]. 
  The president-elect made his statements following a meeting 
with recently elected PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party] 
legislators and members of the future cabinet, who will take 
office as of 1 September. The meeting was designed to 
coordinate future government policies between the executive and 
judicial branches during the transition period. 
  According to Perez Balladares, the government's announced 
budget cuts should not affect the incoming administration. 
  [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe it is unfair 
that our incoming administration should be the one to pay for 
the current administration's inability to meet its debt 
obligations. In this respect, it seems to me that the best 
approach would be to meet with the IFI's and agree on an 
adjustment and reform program that takes into account the 
nation's social needs. I am quite sure Planning Minister 
Guillermo Chapman is of the same opinion and will discuss the 
issue with the IFI's in due time. [end recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- Having assessed that the 
lengthy meeting they held with Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
had not yielded any concrete results, the country's four 
agricultural organizations reported that the agricultural sector 
has been placed "on a state of alert." 
  In a press communique released on 8 June, the organizations 
asserted that their "leaders have voiced and endorsed the 
producers' understandable impatience," and warned that "farmers 
are running out of time in their quest for political solutions." 
  The Argentine Agrarian Federation (FAA), the Argentine Rural 
Association (SRA), the Argentine Rural Confederations (CRA), and 
Coninagro [Agricultural-Livestock Intercooperative 
Confederation] signed a document urging "the rural population to 
keep alert on the latest developments in negotiations." 
  Despite the fact that following the five-hour meeting with 
Cavallo the agricultural organizations' leaders seemed to be 
more satisfied with the official promise to undertake an 
in-depth study of the agricultural situation, as time went by 
and meetings with delegates followed one another, agricultural 
producers' representatives became convinced that those promises 
were insufficient. 
  Thus, during the late hours of 7 June, Humberto Volando, 
Manuel Cabanellas, Eduardo de Zavalia, and Leonidas Gassoni [the 
presidents of FAA, CRA, SRA, and Coninagro respectively] were of 
one mind about the need to be alert to the unfolding of 
negotiations with the government. They moreover acknowledged 
that they had left the meeting at the Economy Ministry 
empty-handed. 
  Despite this the communique stresses that "a lengthy 
analysis 
of the questions raised" was made at the meeting, and that 
"there was some significant agreement with regard to some 
issues, while strides were made concerning others. Yet no 
definite conclusions were reached. The minister committed 
himself to continue to work on the subject and offer concrete 
solutions."

  [Text] Santiago del Estero, 7 Jun (NA) -- Santiago del 
Estero's Pension Fund was taken over peacefully by about 300 
people, including pensioners, to reject the organization's 
imminent transfer to the national administration. 
  Daniel Cejas, president of the pensioner and retired people 
coordinating board, announced that the group will resist the 
government attempt to transfer the Pension Fund to the nation 
"to the final results." 
  "The peaceful takeover that started around 0700 will 
continue 
until federal trustee (Juan) Schiaretti shows up to listen to 
the people and pensioners," Cejas said. 
  On 6 June, in the largest protest demonstration since the 
social outburst in December, some 3,000 people marched in front 
of the federal trustee's office to repudiate the transfer of the 
Pension Fund to the national administration and the Savings and 
Loan Fund's reorganization. 
  According to the administration headed by Schiaretti, a 
native of Cordoba Province, the Pension Fund runs a deficit of 
about 5 million pesos per month, or 60 million pesos a year, and 
needs an in-depth reorganization. 
  Cejas in turn denied the deficit and warned: "The people of 
Santiago are mad and ready to resist this bad government. We 
spoke with many ministers and all of them gave us half answers. 
This is why we want to talk with Schiaretti."

<F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Daniel Casal] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Jun (NA) -- The economic plan must 
face and overcome such obstacles as the lack of profitability 
among regional economies, the threat of a recession, the new 
international financial context, and the requirements arising 
from the political situation in the run-up to the elections. 
  These obstacles are inextricably intertwined since the 
provinces are unable to ease their situation, which is provoked 
by increased relative prices and the difficulties of marketing 
their products. 
  The showcase was Tierra del Fuego Province, which has a 
flourishing economy under the protection of a moribund 
Industrial Promotion System. 
  Difficulties arising from other causes, but with similar 
consequences are found throughout the country -- be it the other 
Patagonian provinces, the northwest, or the northeast. 
  The country is haunted by the ghost of recession over 
setting 
the production machinery in motion. This recession could be 
staved off by strengthening the domestic market or by increasing 
exports. 
  The former possibility seems, however, to have reached a 
point of counter-production, given the reiterated call to 
increase domestic savings. 
  Hence, the only alternative is to increase our exports, 
although we are still trying to increase our productive capacity 
to a point where we can place our products on the international 
market at more competitive prices. 
  The search for increased factory capacity is weighing 
heavily 
on the trade balance deficit, which is an ominous warning for 
the near future. 
  The possibility of devaluing the peso has been totally ruled 
out. This move would cause hundreds of bankruptcies because the 
indebtedness of the private sector. Thus the exchange rate 
should be improved through a reduction of costs. 
  The recent hike in public utility rates was not only 
instrumental in checking the trend toward reducing costs, it 
also helped to ease the May inflation above zero percent. 
  The immediate move of economic authorities will be an 
all-out 
offensive to reduce labor costs and to restore the provincial 
administrations' economies. 
  There are also plans to scare off the ghost of recession, 
which would undermine the basis of one of the most vital tools 
of the convertibility plan -- namely, the level of tax revenues. 
  Housing development plans were designed to boost the 
construction industry, which is undoubtedly the driving force of 
the economy and which generates many new openings. 
  The present international financial market is hampering the 
normal avenues into which investment projects are generally 
channeled and is obliging the government to devise a panoply of 
ideas to boost the construction industry. 
  If the United States had not had the wonderful idea of 
betting on its growth and had decided against increasing 
interest rates to prevent an overheating of the country's 
inflation, the international situation would have continued 
favorable for Argentina. 
  Yet, the Clinton administration bet on growth and 
consequently placed a question mark on the entry of foreign 
capital into Argentina based on the danger of a possible 
increase in domestic interest rates and consequently, a slowdown 
in Argentina's economic growth. 
  Following the same line of reasoning, it would be of 
paramount importance for the government to signal that it will 
try to reduce its trade deficit as a way to obtain genuine 
foreign currency, and thus ease the scarcity of foreign 
financial resources. 
  To conclude, several economists have warned of the risks 
that 
political needs may entail for the economy. 
  Ricardo Lopez Murphy from the Radical Civic Union [UCR] 
believes the Constituent Assembly is the worst thing that could 
have befallen the Argentine economy. 
  Lopez Murphy shares the views of Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo. He utters things that, to some extent, may be 
interpreted as the expression of Cavallo's thinking. 
  Cavallo is concerned about the outcome of the Constituent 
Assembly, the power to be vested in the coordination minister, 
and the concessions that may be granted to the provinces. 
  The 1995 presidential elections are on the horizon, and it 
has already been warned that there might be an increase in 
government spending to attract votes to the ruling party. 
  Nevertheless, the Economy Ministry is well aware that the 
Convertibility Plan was the most effective weapon in the last 
elections, and therefore, will avoid any possible chaos in 
public accounts. 
  As another UCR economist -- former Central Bank President 
Jose Luis Machinea -- said: "The best social program the 
government can implement is to try to stave off recession." 
  Machinea added that the only way the government can meet 
this 
objective is "by increasing exports by an average 15 percent per 
annum."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 6 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
stressed on 6 June that his administration "has demonstrated, 
with facts, our respect for and our belief in the freedom of the 
press." He noted that the freedom of the press "is incompatible 
with any type of totalitarianism." 
  Menem also asked journalists "to report in a responsible 
way." He said the media's credibility "is linked to its 
commitment to the truth." 
  The president made these remarks during a speech he 
delivered 
in Government House's White Hall while signing the Chapultepec 
Declaration, a list of principles for freedom of the press that 
was released on 11 March by the Inter-American Press Association 
[IAPA] in Chapultepec. 
  During the signing ceremony, which was attended by 
publishers 
from Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and the United States, IAPA 
President Raul Kraiselburd delivered a speech. Kraiselburd 
noted: "In the great battles fought in the continent to preserve 
the democratic system, the restoration of freedom of the press 
represented a goal for very different and competing groups." 
  Menem stressed that "the freedom of respect and of the 
press" 
prevailing under his administration "has not been and will not 
be changed because we understand there cannot be any democratic 
system without freedom of the press." 
  Menem pointed out: "We heartily support Thomas Jefferson's 
remark that `it is preferable to have freedom of the press 
without a government than a government without freedom of the 
press' and, in this regard, we demonstrated our belief by 
accepting, without any type of censorship, the harshest and most 
pungent criticism ever received by any president in the 
Argentine Republic." 
  Menem stressed: "The gates to information were always open. 
If there was any friction and, sometimes, bumps with the 
journalists, it was more because of abundant information than 
lack of information." 
  Menem added that the Chapultepec Declaration "therefore 
represents for us a logical result, supported by the goal of 
having this freedom of the press now prevailing in Argentina 
equally prevail in all American countries and in the entire 
world as a basic guarantee for human rights." 
  Menem stressed: "The freedom of the press is incompatible 
with any type of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism cannot 
tolerate freedom of the press because it would be tantamount to 
tolerating criticism, and history has demonstrated to us that 
totalitarianism are more prone to self-criticism, which always 
comes late and in a more cushioned way." 
  Concerning the Chapultepec Declaration, Menem emphasized 
that 
"no one will be allowed to force a journalist to reveal his or 
her sources of information" and that "no one may impair or deny 
the right to seek or receive information, that there may not be 
any censorship before publication, that there may not be any 
forced association, and that the freedom of the press may not be 
impaired through tariff policies or paper and advertising 
control policies." 
  Menem pointed out: "Nevertheless, this declaration also 
points out that the media's credibility is linked to its 
commitment to the truth." 
  At the end of his message, Menem said: "Some day I will no 
longer be president. I will have to resume my private 
activities. We basically want democracy to continue prevailing 
and liberty to continue increasing, and, within this framework, 
we want Argentina to regain the place it was able to occupy in 
other periods of its institutional life."

  [Text] Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero has announced new 
decisions regarding the real currency. Ricupero, who met with 
the Chamber of Deputies Economy Committee, came to seek 
guarantees that farmers would continue to produce food. Today 
it was agreed that the government will renegotiate the farmers' 
debts, and give them up to 10 years to repay. The government 
will likewise pay the overdue farming insurance debts and 
suspend for three months the Bank of Brazil lawsuits against 
farmers in arrears. 
  During a luncheon with commerce representatives, Ricupero 
explained the implementation of the new currency. During this 
luncheon he gave advance notice of some of the points of the 
economic plan: 
  Credits: The government will not adopt any measure to reduce 
consumption of goods like cars and household appliances. 
  Interest rates: They will continue to be high until the 
economy reaches stability. 
  Contracts: Those in real cruzeiros will be converted into 
URV's [real value units] based on the URV rate of 1 July. 
  Ufir [Reference Fiscal Unit]: It will not be abolished. It 
will continue to index income tax paid in advance and overdue 
taxes. 
  Postdated checks: Banks will accept checks written in real 
cruzeiros until 1 August.

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Union Force secretary 
general Emilson Simoes de Moura, nicknamed Alemao, today joined 
the campaign command of presidential candidate Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso. Alemao promised to obtain the support of 800 unions 
affiliated with Union Force, which is led by Luiz Antonio de 
Medeiros, the Popular Party's candidate for governor of Sao 
Paulo State. Union Force has chosen not to lend its support to 
any one candidate. 
  Alemao said: "I feel absolutely comfortable with the 
coalition and with [former Bahia Governor] Antonio Carlos 
Magalhaes, who is a democrat and who is altogether different 
from those Stalinists and Lula supporters who advocate crime as 
an instrument of political struggle." Alemao believes that if 
Lula is elected there will be no investments in the country to 
create jobs. "It will bring tragic consequences for all 
workers," he said. 
  Endorsing the principles of the Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party coalition, 
Alemao defends the internationalization of the Brazilian 
economy. He said: "This is why we are against Lula." Alemao is 
in favor of ending the state monopoly of oil and of privatizing 
state-owned companies. 
  Alemao's first suggestion to Cardoso is to increase the goal 
of creating 8 million jobs during his four-year tenure. "That 
is not enough," Alemao said. He refused to admit that the 
economic stabilization program promoted by Cardoso will worsen 
unemployment in the country. He said: "One cannot state that 
the Real Plan is provoking unemployment." 
  Although confirming that unions affiliated with Union Force 
will support Cardoso, Alemao made it clear that Cardoso will not 
use its facilities in his campaign. "We have sound trucks, but 
Cardoso will not use them," he said, criticizing once again the 
involvement of CUT [Sole Workers Center] affiliated unions in 
Lula's campaign. He said: "CUT has been completely overtaken." 
  Asked if he would hold the post of labor minister if Cardoso 
wins the election, Alemao said he would rather take the reins of 
the economy. He said jokingly: "I would prefer to be the 
finance minister." Cardoso declined to comment on this issue. 
He said: "I will not discuss the formation of my cabinet at 
this time."

  [Text] Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Espirito Santo, 8 Jun (AE) 
-- If elected president, PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva wants to create a public television channel 
to counterbalance the "monopoly of the great private 
broadcasting companies." Today he defended the creation of a 
public broadcasting company reaching from "Oiapoque [Amapa 
State] to Chui [Rio Grande do Sul State]," and asked, referring 
to the owners of the television networks: "How is it that one 
citizen alone can speak to 80 million Brazilians?" 
  Lula mentioned the "TV Cultura" station of Sao Paulo as an 
ideal model for the new public station. "I want a television 
channel transmitting serious reports to counterbalance the large 
television networks, a channel that will broadcast something 
more than commercial programs." 
  The PT candidate criticized the excessive violence shown on 
television, and said that in Brazil 90 percent of the media is 
in the hands of nine families. He also criticized the rules 
used to grant television station licenses. "Every town in the 
interior has a former deputy, a former governor, who owns a 
radio or television channel," he complained. 
  Lula guarantees that the new television channel -- which 
would be created by reformulating TV Educativa -- would not be 
just another public television station serving merely to 
increase the federal government's payroll. "I want to take 
advantage of what already exists in several states, and transmit 
a uniform national programming," he said.

<F P=106> [Article by Marcelo Mendonca] </F>
  [Excerpt] PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso has become a 
hostage of the economic plan that he implemented while he was 
still heading the Finance Ministry. Figures from the last 
Datafolha poll conducted on 23 and 24 May show that the voters' 
main reason for supporting the PSDB candidate is the Real Plan. 
This is this year's first national survey by Datafolha about 
the motivations for voting. 
  In addition to linking the creator to the creature, 
Cardoso's 
voters also hope that their votes will ensure the continuity of 
the plan if he succeeds President Franco. 
  In second place, with 17 percent of voters' preferences, 
Cardoso is also chosen by his voters because he is "efficient" 
(11 percent) and "honest" (11 percent). 
  This imbalance in the motivation for voting, which weighs 
heavily on only one factor, is deemed risky by experts in 
political marketing. The possibility of a failure of the 
economic plan could destroy the former minister's chances at the 
ballot boxes. 
  Even with no certainty about the economic situation, the 
economic plan is already a problem for the candidate. The 
complaint that the Real Plan "is not functioning" already is the 
main reason for rejecting the PSDB candidate (27 percent). The 
impression that he "made up the plan to become a candidate" 
represents the reason for 8 percent of the voters rejecting him. 
  The leading candidate in the Datafolha poll, Luiz Inacio 
Lula 
da Silva (PT) [Workers Party], with 40 percent of voters' 
preferences, has inspired a more balanced motivation among his 
voters. Their main reason to vote for Lula is that he has been 
"a poor man, a worker" (17 percent). This is closely followed 
by "representing the workers" (16 percent), and a chance "to try 
something new" (12 percent). 
  The main reason for rejecting Lula is his "lack of ability 
to 
govern the country" (15 percent). The leftist radicalism that 
his campaign has been trying to soften still marks his image in 
the eyes of the voters: 13 percent of those who reject him 
believe he is an "agitator" who promotes strikes; and 8 percent 
that he "is a Communist." 
  The main reasons for voters to support Quercia, the PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] candidate (8 percent); 
Brizola, the PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate (7 percent); 
and Esperidiao Amin, the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] 
candidate (3 percent) is that "they have been good governors" in 
their states. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Sonia Silva] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco 
today signed a law establishing prison terms of from two to five 
years to those found guilty of manufacturing, marketing, 
distributing, or disseminating symbols, emblems, ornaments, 
badges, or advertisement using swastikas with a view toward 
fomenting Nazism. The new law, which is designed to stop acts 
of violence perpetrated by neo-Nazi groups in Brazil, will 
become part of Law 7716, which defines the crimes of racism and 
discrimination. 
  Deputy Alberto Goldman (Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party-Sao Paulo State), who proposed the bill, estimates that 
there are at least 13 neo-Nazi groups in Brazil. He cited the 
"White Power" and the "ABC Skinheads" in Sao Paulo. In May, 
four men armed with knives and handguns tattooed swastikas on a 
14-year-old girl who responds to the initials N.M.P.L. in 
Taubate, Sao Paulo State. The men had swastikas tattooed on 
their faces. The law may be used to bring aggravating 
circumstances in assault and battery cases. 
  Goldman said: "By displaying swastika symbols, these groups 
are clearly revealing a menacing attitude, using force and 
brutality to discriminate against and affect certain social 
groups such as blacks, Jews, residents of northeastern Brazil, 
and homosexuals." He does not believe the new law is violating 
freedom of expression. He added: "Freedom of expression 
promotes ideological debate and democratic discussions, while 
swastikas are used to foment racism and intolerance."

  [Text] Bern, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio 
Cotti said he is "deeply annoyed" by the presence of Chilean 
Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet in Switzerland. 
  According to today's issue of LUZERNER NEUSTEN NACHRICHTEN, 
Cotti said he understands the indignation of Chileans living in 
Switzerland. 
  Cotti regretted there is no longer the juridical possibility 
of preventing Pinochet from entering the country. 
  Pinochet's stay in Lucerne on 7 June caused protests by the 
Green Alliance, the Swiss Socialist Youth, the Swiss Council for 
Peace, and the Work Group for Arms Control and the Prohibition 
of Arms Exports because, according to some information, the 
Chilean Army is reportedly interested in buying weapons. 
  Green Alliance Deputy Cecile Buhlmann said Gen. Pinochet 
should be considered an "undesirable person in Switzerland" and 
that she would questioned the Lucerne Legislature about his visa 
permit.

  [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Government and opposition 
deputies agreed today to ask the Defense Ministry to explain how 
it financed the trip being made by Army Commander General 
Augusto Pinochet to the Czech Republic and other European 
countries. 
  The initiative was approved by 50 votes in favor, 12 votes 
against by the ultra-conservative Independent Democratic Union 
(UDI), and six abstentions. 
  Pinochet, who governed Chile from 1973 to 1990, currently is 
in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he arrived on 4 June from Prague 
after a five-day visit to the Czech Republic, a country he 
entered by car from The Netherlands. 
  Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo said: "It is an obligation to 
know how Pinochet's trip to Eastern Europe is being financed." 
But UDI Congressman Francisco Bertolucci said the idea is to 
make the Army commander "uncomfortable." 
  Asked about the request, Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma 
said that "so far we have not received the request," and that 
Pinochet "was given the treatment in Prague he deserves as an 
individual and as Army commander. Everything was normal." 
  Perez added that the visit to the Czech Republic was 
"official and institutional." He added that there was "never" a 
plan for him to visit Russia, and that he does not know when 
Pinochet will return to Chile. 
  After leaving the government on 11 March 1990, Pinochet made 
several trips through Latin America, Europe, and South Africa. 
These types of trips were practically prohibited to him when he 
headed the military regime due to the accusations of continuous 
human right violations and the negative votes in this regard in 
all international meetings.

  [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (AFP-NA) -- Official sources said on 
7 June that Chilean President Eduardo Frei will not approve any 
"new amnesty law" to liberate military officers accused of 
violating human rights under the Augusto Pinochet regime. 
  More than 500 cases of assassination, kidnapping, and the 
disappearance of nearly 1,000 individuals who opposed Pinochet 
-- whose regime extended from 1973 to 1990 -- were filed in 
court during the four years of Patricio Aylwin's administration, 
who was succeeded by Eduardo Frei. 
  "We support the principle that those found responsible by 
the 
courts should be punished," Secretary General of Government 
Victor Manuel Rebolledo said. 
  "A new amnesty law has not been contemplated," Rebolledo 
added, referring to the amnesty law promulgated by Pinochet in 
April 1978 freeing many of his agents from facing trials for 
crimes committed before that date. 
  One of those crimes was the assassination of former Foreign 
Minister Orlando Letelier, who was killed by a bomb that 
exploded under his car in downtown Washington on 21 September 
1976. 
  On 3 June, the Supreme Court refused to apply the amnesty 
law 
to absolve two of the main culprits in that crime, former 
intelligence chief General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro 
Espinoza, who were sentenced by a lower court to seven years in 
prison.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 6 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei today urged ministers and leaders from the 
Coalition of Parties for Democracy [CPPD] to strengthen the 
governing coalition, not to yield to populist temptations, and 
to explain the government's actions. 
  The president was the main speaker at the meeting between 
the 
government and CPPD leaders. The five-hour meeting was attended 
by ministers of state, government officials, and the main 
leaders of the governing coalition's parties. 
  In his speech, Frei said the Common Pact must be upheld 
without yielding to populist temptations, and reiterated that a 
high-quality, excellent, and also personalized government that 
works with the people must be consolidated. 
  Frei said: "The CPPD must be safeguarded and its influence 
extended throughout the country because this is the only way to 
ensure a spirit of consensus at a nationwide level." 
  The president warned that although opposition groups 
sometime 
adopt attitudes that promote conflicts and polarization, "the 
search for agreements that grant legitimacy and grandeur must be 
pursued." 
  He also mentioned the need to maintain a strict fiscal 
discipline and a sound macroeconomic policy and admitted that 
the current government, which came to power on 11 March, is 
subject to greater pressure than the previous administration 
because those demands that were made timidly have now become 
stronger. 
  Frei urged coalition leaders not to yield to populist 
temptations and asked them to reflect on the consequences of an 
irresponsible position in this regard. 
  Frei later accepted criticisms of his 21 May speech for 
failing to mention human rights, and added that he did not think 
it necessary to continue assessing the transition process and 
its problems. 
  He mentioned that it is obvious that in a responsible 
democratic system human rights should be fully respected and 
added that, regarding constitutional reforms, every possible 
effort will be made to make the institutions completely 
democratic since this is Chile's historical tradition. 
  Frei said an attitude of respect for the people in the 
written and common law must be strengthened and said that soon 
he will "solemnly and publicly" announce Chilean recognition of 
the women and men who gave their lives for their fellow citizens 
during the years of the military regime (1973-1990). 
  He added that the country will thus learn the testimony and 
examples set by church members, attorneys, and political and 
social leaders to whom, he said, we owe our appreciation.

  [Text] Santiago, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Haroldo Venegas, director 
of the Chilean Association of Exporters of Nontraditional 
Manufactured Products (Asexma), reported today that the 
preferential treatment granted to Chilean exports within 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South] countries will expire in 
December. Chilean exports to Mercosur countries total about $1 
billion. 
  The Chilean business leader added that, within this context, 
there is an urgent need for an association with Mercosur. 
  Venegas said that such association will mean Chilean 
products 
will not lose their competitiveness in the Mercosur market, 
which comprises 190 million people. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will meet today in 
Buenos Aires with Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. 
During the meeting Figueroa will hand Di Tella a Chilean 
proposal for joining Mercosur -- which comprises Argentina, 
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
  Asexma figures show that Chilean exports to Mercosur in 1993 
totaled $1,089 billion, which represents 11.6 percent of all 
Chilean exports. 
  Commercial trade between Chile and Mercosur countries 
totaled 
$2,850 billion. 
  Some 74 percent of Chilean exports enter the Mercosur market 
under a system of preferential treatment that Chile negotiated 
at the bilateral level with each of the four Mercosur countries 
within the framework of the Latin American Integration 
Association (ALADI). 
  In 1993, 80 percent of all Chilean exports to Argentina, the 
fourth most important Chilean commercial partner, were granted 
preferential treatment: Chilean exports to Argentina in 1993 
totaled $588.9 million. The third [as received] most important 
Chilean commercial partner is Brazil: Some 95 percent of Chilean 
exports to Brazil, worth $407.1 million, were granted 
preferential treatment. 
  Venegas stated that if some kind of agreement is not 
negotiated, many products will be seriously effected in the 
Mercosur market because of high tariff rates -- about 25 percent 
in Brazil and 20 percent in Argentina.

  [Text] Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone 
yesterday warned that without macroeconomic stability Paraguay 
will not receive the foreign financial assistance it needs to 
finance productive activities. He said this during his routine 
working lunch at the Paraguayan-American Chamber of Commerce. 
  The minister said that, contrary to past practices, the 
current government has decided to use new foreign loans to 
provide long-term financing for private activities. The minister 
said funds will be used to capitalize the Industrial Development 
Fund and the Peasant Development Fund. 
  Scavone said the government will use resources from an 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) "Sectorial Investment 
Program" loan. The minister said negotiations to obtain these 
funds means the fulfillment of rather harsh requirements on 
inflation control, the reduction of public spending, fiscal 
surplus, etc. 
  The government must take firm steps in the area of financial 
reform, the reorganization of the private banking system based 
on concrete indicators on risk and solvency, the creation of a 
capital market regulatory framework (to increase market 
credibility and to assure the trading of long-term titles), and 
the reform of the social security system. 
  The minister said: "Within the context of logical delays for 
such ambitious structural reforms, Paraguay will receive the $80 
million it now has on free availability status. The country will 
also become eligible for numerous financial transactions that 
were denied us in the past." 
  Scavone said our financial system has many distortions that 
are expressed in high interest rates and short-term financial 
applications. He said distortions create high profit margins, 
high risk investment financing, and the neglect of projects that 
are needed for the country's development. 
  The minister regretted that everything that has been seen so 
far to improve the system has not encouraged more reforms or 
reduced financial costs. He said the system's inefficiency is 
strongly dependent on the regulatory framework, which is totally 
inappropriate for the development of a competitive banking 
system. 
  He cited as an example the fact that the total of $1.2 
billion in deposits is distributed among 100 financial 
institutions, each one having an average deposit of $12 million. 
This makes it impossible to establish a competitive financial 
entity in Latin America today. 
  Scavone criticized: "This is largely due to the unequal 
treatment of financial entities which have fragmented the 
market, created unfair competition, and made efficient bank 
supervision difficult."

  [Text] Caracas, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Venezuelan Government 
today reiterated its rejection of any unilateral or multilateral 
armed intervention by any country in Haiti. 
  Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said that 
Venezuela will not be a party--under any circumstances--to any 
armed action in Haiti to oust the military regime. Burelli 
reaffirmed Venezuela's willingness to cooperate in solving the 
Haitian crisis, mentioning both nations' historical ties. 
  The Haitian crisis was one of the subjects discussed during 
the foreign ministers' meeting held on Monday, taking advantage 
of the OAS meeting in Belem de Para (Brazil). 
  The Venezuelan foreign minister said that Venezuela is one 
of 
the nations that has made great efforts seeking a solution to 
the Haitian problem and for the restoration of ousted 
Constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide. Venezuela, the 
United States, France, and Canada are part of the so-called 
"Group of Friends" that have sought alternatives for the 
political crisis Haiti has experienced since Aristide left power. 
  Burelli also indicated that Venezuela will only accept a 
small group of Haitian refugees, after the Venezuelan Embassy in 
the United States has certified their qualifications to be 
received by the nation. The Venezuelan foreign minister 
indicated that it was necessary "to definitely clear up 
speculation," which has arisen on Venezuela's decision to accept 
Haitian refugees. 
  Burelli referred to the letter sent by U.S. Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher in which he requests Venezuela's 
cooperation to receive Haitian refugees. Nevertheless, the 
Venezuelan reply to Christopher sums up that "under current 
circumstances it has a flow of uninvited immigrants," who have 
made even more difficult the conditions "increasing poverty and 
aggravating the social order problem," Burelli indicated. "We 
would accept a group qualified and certified by our embassy in 
Washington," he added. 
  Burelli also denied some statements published by several 
local papers indicating Venezuela was ready to receive several 
hundreds of Haitian refugees. He admitted, however, that if 
Haitian refugees do arrive, their stay permanence will "only be 
temporary," dependent on the solution of problems in Haiti. 
  The minister finally ruled out the possibility of Venezuela 
becoming a Haitian refugee camp.

  [Text] According to Senator Aydee Castillo de Lopez, 
president of the Senate Foreign Policy Committee, it is highly 
unusual for the United States to deny asylum to Haitian 
refugees, while, at the same time, asking Venezuela to receive 
them. The senator added that Venezuela currently is not in the 
best of economic and social conditions to receive the Haitian 
refugees. 
  She stressed that it was quite unexpected that a highly 
developed nation such as the United States has decided not to 
give the refugees asylum, and yet it has asked a country like 
Venezuela--a nation facing a crisis--to receive them. She added 
that what is even more unusual is that the Venezuelan Government 
has decided to accept the request.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom has asked 
Strobe Talbott, U.S. assistant secretary of state, for his 
country's assistance in fighting corruption, given this struggle 
cannot be waged within the limits of Venezuela alone and 
requires the support of major countries to efficiently combat 
it. Corruption at home sometimes has implications abroad, the 
official has said. 
  Will the extradition of those who have committed offenses be 
discussed? a reporter asked. It is still too early to talk 
about that, but I congratulate you for your imagination, Escovar 
replied during the departure of the U.S. retinue of top 
officials comprising Joan Spero, assistant secretary of state 
for economic affairs, and Alexander Watson, assistant secretary 
of state for inter-American affairs, and Ambassador Jeffrey 
Davidow. 
  The interior minister also discussed with them certain 
topics 
related to the problem of the governability of Venezuela and 
Latin America, because in Venezuela, in his words, we have a 
demonstration of what an ungovernable democracy is. "I told them 
that we did not have an economic crisis in Venezuela but, 
rather, the floundering of institutions, the floundering of 
governability, and that is the challenge this government is 
facing." 
  Increasing cooperation with the United States is 
indispensable. We face common challenges, Escovar said, 
regarding the defense of democracy, in addition to something 
that is very important: the need for major countries' 
cooperation in fighting corruption. We need international 
cooperation, because we want to chase certain crimes of 
corruption out from Venezuelan borders, hence the support we are 
requesting from the international community. 
  U.S. official Talbott talked to reporters about the positive 
results of the meeting with the interior minister. [passage

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 7 
June. 
  The Superintendency for Foreign Investments--SIEX--has 
reported that foreign investments amounted to $93.6 million in 
May. This represents a 206 percent increase from the $30.5 
million registered in April. SIEX added that the investments 
include $89.4 million in foreign exchange, $2.7 million in real 
estate, and $1.4 million in capital and credits. The investments 
were made in the following sectors: $83.6 million in 
transportation and storage, $47.2 million in manufacturing, $7.2 
million in financial services, $6.4 million in commerce, 
$845,000 in agriculture and animal breeding, and $554,000 in 
construction. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 2-4) 
  Deputy Finance Minister Luis Xavier Grisanti has affirmed 
that the government will privatize the firms that comprise the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana, CVG. He said the government 
wants this process to attract domestic and foreign investors 
because they could contribute capital, technology, markets, and 
management that will make the firms more competitive. Grisanti 
added that public services currently rendered by the CVG will be 
transferred to local governments. (Caracas Union Radio Network 
in Spanish 2200 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  Russian International Oil Company manager Vladimir 
Sustareyev has reported that representatives from three private 
Russian oil firms are attending the Maracaibo oil fair and have 
expressed interest in reaching economic cooperation agreements 
with the Venezuelan oil industry. (Caracas Union Radio Network 
in Spanish 2200 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  A survey shows that there were 40,512 less jobs over the 
past 
three months when compared to the previous three months, and 
109,964 less jobs than in the same three-month period in 1993. 
Venezuelan Council of Industry President Jorge Redmond said 
these figures show the difficult situation faced by the 
manufacturing sector. The poll shows that the economic 
instability of the past three months has prompted a 22.4 percent 
decline in production and a 21.8 percent drop in demand. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 2-7) 
  Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking 
Protection Fund [FOGADE], has stated at Miraflores Palace that 
FOGADE will reorganize or privatize the seven banks and the 
other financial institution FOGADE is currently assisting if 
their shareholders do not repay their debts and increase their 
capital holdings within the scheduled time frame. (Caracas Union 
Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 2 Jun 94) 
  Environment Minister Roberto Perez Lecuna has reported that 
the executive branch has approved an emergency program to 
revitalize the water treatment program in the metropolitan area, 
earmarking 4.2 billion bolivares for this program. Perez 
reported that "efforts have begun" to obtain a 500-million 
bolivar loan that will allow "the total reorganization of the 
Caracas sewer system." (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 
2200 GMT 31 May 94)

<F P=106> [Report by Antonia Marcia Valle from Belem, Para State] </F>
  [Text] Commercial flights to Haiti of the countries of the 
American continent will be canceled, the bank accounts of the 
military officers who ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
will be frozen, and the commercial and financial transactions 
with Haiti will be suspended. These measures are part of the 
resolution approved on 7 June by the OAS Assembly. They 
reinforce the economic blockade already imposed on the 
dictatorial Haitian regime. Their objective is to force the 
coupist military officers to leave power. 
  In OAS Secretary General Ambassador Baena Soares' opinion, 
these measures can only be effective if all countries comply 
with them. Baena Soares pointed out that these same sanctions 
already have been approved by the OAS five times: 
  [Begin Baena Soares recording] All that is missing is 
compliance with what has been approved. Sanctions, as the United 
Nations calls them, and measures, as the OAS calls them, can be 
effective, but only if they are complied with. [end recording] 
  The blockade of Haiti was reinforced after the plenary 
session listened to a report by the UN and OAS representative 
for Haiti, (Collin Granderson). He reported on murdered and 
missing people, and on an escalation of raping of wives, 
mothers, daughters, and sisters of militants who defend 
democracy.

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Samper from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] Last year, when Army General Raul Castro, in an 
interview granted to the newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO, announced 
the island's goal of having the most cost-effective Armed Forces 
in the hemisphere, the Cuban military's efforts -- efforts the 
military had been making for some time -- finally became public. 
  At the end of the eighties, the Defense Ministry's expenses 
totaled hundreds of millions of pesos. A review of these 
expenses paved the way for a reduction in costs after basic 
steps were taken to update the military's financial system. 
Measures were applied at all levels, thereby reorganizing the 
budget system on the basis of charging for goods and services 
provided or required by each unit. 
  Profitability, costs, control of resources, the struggle for 
efficiency, and the policy of basing investments on profits are 
part of the vocabulary that dominates the process now under way 
within the FAR [Revolutionary Armed Forces]. 
  During a conversation with Colonel Harry Villegas of the 
Western Army's political sector, I was able to understand more 
profoundly how the armed institution's self-financing is being 
achieved. 
  [Begin recording] [Villegas] Based on the principle that we 
must be self-financed, [words indistinct] budget, there are two 
basic roads to self-financing. One is a reduction in expenses, 
and the second is money-making efforts. Money-making efforts 
have been taking place in agricultural production; in commercial 
activities, such as taking care of officers' homes, tourism, and 
the sale of certain food supplies; and in various other 
activities. All of these steps help reduce expenses. 
  Under this system, each one of these primary, agricultural 
and commercial activities has its own account. These activities 
are generating profits gradually. Once profits are realized, 60 
percent go toward taxes which, in turn, remain in the Armed 
Forces Ministry, but at a ministry level. Meanwhile, 12 percent 
of these profits go to Social Security, and 5 percent -- as in 
the case of commercial activities -- are distributed among those 
taking part in earning the profits. The remaining profits go 
into the unit chief's account, and these funds can be used for 
new investments. They can be used to motivate individuals or to 
resolve problems in the unit itself. 
  This represents very efficient financial control. Gradually, 
both factors, when you see the overall picture, will reduce the 
budget and will limit or reduce expenses. 
  [Samper] Therefore, you are saying that nowadays unit chiefs 
must become multitalented men. They must be very knowledgeable 
in several fields and in a number of specialties because they 
can no longer simply rely on their military training, as they 
have done up until now. Therefore, the unit chief must also 
fulfill political duties and other specific duties. 
  [Villegas] They must be fully prepared. 
  [Samper] That is right, they must be fully prepared. 
Currently, what new responsibilities and skills are required of 
unit chiefs? 
  [Villegas] Currently, as you have been able to see, we 
devote 
ourselves to combat training. We are practically maintaining 
the same level of combat training we previously had. In 
addition to this, however, we must also guarantee our soldiers' 
nourishment. [Word indistinct] is being guaranteed, and it is 
being guaranteed in a qualitative fashion. We must control 
conservation and maintenance of [word indistinct], which, as you 
can see, this activity requires. We must take charge of 
deployment. You have been able to observe that a high 
percentage -- and, each time it will be higher -- of our combat 
forces order arms [words indistinct]. 
  Another skill required is that of an economist. We are not 
talking about economists with degrees or economists [word 
indistinct]; instead, they must have command of the economy. 
They must know what a product costs, and not be content with a 
product that represents a loss. At all times, they must know 
what resources require investments, how to make investments, and 
to truly control costs. They must truly oversee investments. 
  Of course, one must devote time to this. When all of these 
qualities are taken into account, you will realize that our unit 
chiefs must be well prepared. [end recording] 
  Cuba's FAR is on the road to self-financing, which, from an 
economic viewpoint, translates into reduced dependency on the 
state's overall budget. Moreover, it also translates into 
greater defensive capabilities, maneuverability, and flexibility.

  [Text] Efrain Goldenberg, president of the Council of 
Ministers and foreign minister, said yesterday that the 
preliminary report of the OAS Inter-American Human Rights 
Committee (CIDH), which recognizes the violation of ex-President 
Alan Garcia Perez's human rights, has no juridical effect and 
that this organization lacks any jurisdiction. 
  He harshly questioned the leaking of the preliminary report 
which he said is a "confidential" report. 
  Goldenberg expressed annoyance over the CIDH report which 
adds that Peru violated the guarantees of an adequate process in 
the case of Alan Garcia. 
  He said the judicial proceedings against Garcia for illegal 
enrichment and for the illegal possession of weapons will 
continue "because this investigation is completely independent 
of the matters discussed by the CIDH which has no power to make 
decisions or issue rulings." 
  He said the Peruvian Government has a term in which to 
implement appropriate actions, adding that the committee could 
even decide to shelf the case. 
  Goldenberg several times denied that the committee's 
preliminary report was a warning of the unstable Peruvian 
juridical system. 
  Regarding the release of the report in Washington, 
Goldenberg 
accused the head of the CIDH executive secretariat of unduly 
releasing the report. 
  He added that the diplomatic protest was already conveyed to 
the OAS through the permanent representative to that 
organization. 
  He believes the "leak" could affect the calm consideration 
of 
issues still pending for study by the committee. 
  The CIDH preliminary report indicates that the trial for 
illegal possession of weapons and illegal enrichment are based 
on "evidence obtained illegally" because action was taken 
without a court order and without the presence of a prosecutor. 
  But the forceful part of the report is the condemnation over 
the violations of the human rights of ex-President Garcia, his 
wife, and children. 
  Minister Goldenberg labeled the classification of Peru as a 
"narco state" by a French independent organization as completely 
out of place. 
  He said Peru was once in danger of becoming a "narco state" 
but this is no longer the case. 
  He stated categorically that it is not state policy to 
encourage the production, consumption, and traffic of drugs. 
  On the country, he said, Peru fights that criminal activity 
and the "results can be seen." 
  He said that the French organization was probably using old 
information. 
  He added: "The newspapers now frequently show the capture of 
light planes and other concrete facts." 
  Goldenberg did not want to be more specific of when there 
was a danger of becoming a narco state. At the insistence of 
reporters he said, smiling, that he was not referring to the 
Middle Ages "but to a recent period." 
  Goldenberg also revealed that Peru has signed agreements on 
investment protection with Paraguay, Colombia, France, 
Switzerland, United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and that one is 
about to be signed with the United States. 
  He expressed the government's great interest in continuing 
to 
sign this type of agreements with all countries with which it 
maintains relations. 
  Goldenberg also talked about the recent creation of the 
National Patriotic Council [Junta Patriotica Nacional--JPN] 
headed by Hugo de Zela Hurtado which strongly defends the 
enforcement of the 1929 Treaty with Chile and demands the 
annulment of the harmful 1993 Lima Convention. 
  In a conciliatory tone, Goldenberg said the government fully 
agrees with the objectives of the council but refused to talk 
about annulling the questioned convention. 
  He said the government will at no time neglect the defense 
and protection of national interests. 
  He said the enforcement of treaties is part of the 
government 
policy and that there is no need to worry about the government 
failing to enforce international treaties or neglecting the 
country's interest. 
  Foreign Minister Goldenberg made these comments after 
signing 
an important food aid agreement with U.S. Ambassador Alvin 
Adams, USAID Director George Wachtenheim, and Peruvian Economy 
Minister Jorge Camet.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican Foreign 
Secretariat declined to comment today on the possible arrival of 
U.S. troops to the Dominican Republic as "logistic support" to 
oversee the compliance of the embargo against Haiti. 
  Fabio Herrera Cabral, deputy foreign secretary of state, 
according to Foreign Secretariat sources, has maintained 
"intense contacts" this week with Apostolic Nuncio Fortunato 
Baldelli, UN representatives, the UN high commissioner for 
refugees (ACNUR), and other Latin American diplomats. 
  Today, Chamber of Deputies President Norge Botello warned 
that thousands of Haitian women and children are planning to 
stage a protest march along the border on 12 June to demand that 
food be allowed to enter Haiti from the Dominican Republic. 
  Botello said a "misfortune could occur" should the Dominican 
military attempt to oppose the Haitian demonstration. "I 
believe it is a difficult situation, the reason why our 
authorities must try to control the situation, discern what is 
taking place, and try to resolve it," he added. 
  He called on the Dominican authorities and UN 
representatives 
in Santo Domingo to allow food and medication to reach "a 
population that is dying of famine." 
  Likewise, the opposition party Independent Revolutionary 
Party (PRI) called on Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer to 
"break the blockade" against Haiti so as to prevent a "genocide 
along the border." 
  PRI Vice President Hector Guzman contends the OAS and the 
United Nations "are not fulfilling their obligation to the 
Dominican Republic, the reason why President Balaguer does not 
have to fulfill his obligation to the embargo against Haiti." 
  He said the "total shutdown" of the Dominican-Haitian border 
is to the detriment of both nations, which share the island of 
Hispaniola. 
  Also today, the group of progovernment deputies of the 
Social 
Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) requested Balaguer and the 
United Nations lift the embargo against the military, who 
deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 
1991 because it only affects those lower income Haitians. 
  The Dominican Armed Forces, responsible for enforcing the 
embargo, reiterated "the border is under control." 
  The Defense Ministry's position was adopted following U.S. 
Ambassador Robert Pastorino's visit to the border with Haiti 
this past weekend so as to supervise the implementation of the 
embargo. 
  Pastorino stated in Dajabon, a Dominican city near the 
border 
with Haiti, that the United States and the Dominican Republic 
are assessing the possibility of allowing food and medications 
to reach the Haitian people. 
  On 6 June, after blocking passage, the Dominican soldiers 
stationed along the border, allowed a select group of Haitians 
to cross the border to purchase medications, but only in 
household amounts. The Dominican soldiers allowed their Haitian 
colleagues, relatives, and civilians to cross the Dominican 
border for two hours. 
  Since the total embargo against Haiti went into affect, as a 
result of violent incidents that have broken out, at least two 
Haitians have been killed attempting to cross the border to 
purchase food and fuel. The victims are a man who was shot by a 
Dominican soldier on 5 June and a woman who was found dead on 7 
June in what is believed to be a score-settling incident between 
smugglers. 
  With respect to the total embargo, the Dominican military 
expressed its concern that it may have to "kill several hundred 
Haitians who would rather die here (in Dominican territory) and 
not in their own country."

agreement on the issue of uprooted Guatemalans, although the 
foundation of a subsequent agreement was laid. This is why a 
third meeting will be held next week in Mexico, he added. 
  The government official was in Puebla, Mexico, on 1 and 2 
June heading the official delegation that held a "small meeting" 
with the commanders of the insurgent Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG), because during the first round of 
talks they failed to reach a consensus. On that occasion, 
Rosada maintained the negotiations were not broken. 
  A CERIGUA news agency report points out the differences of 
opinions and the difficulties in reaching a consensus after the 
government delegation rejected the proposal by the Civilian 
Society Assembly (ASC) were the reasons why the negotiations 
failed. The Ramiro De Leon Carpio government rejected the 
report and accused CERIGUA of attributing statements to the URNG 
commanders, thus justifying its position that the URNG is 
"politicizing" the human rights issue. 
  Rosada said yesterday there were positive results on a 
possible agreement in the meeting with the URNG, but they agreed 
to meet next week in Mexico to sign a document on the uprooted 
people, a controversial issue at the negotiations. He pointed 
out that during the meeting there was an exchange of opinions 
within a framework of mutual "respect and resolve," which the 
insurgent commanders recognized. 
  Although Rosada refused to give details of the issues 
discussed during these conversations, he stressed that the 
cease-fire in the area of Ixcan, Quiche Department, was indeed 
discussed. This step constitutes a preliminary action in light 
of the complete disarmament in December 1994, the rejoining of 
political life by the guerrillas as a peace agreement is being 
signed, and the ASC human rights proposal. 
  The official recalled that any decision made during the 
meeting does not mean the irrefutable signing of an agreement, 
because this signing will take place in Oslo, Norway, as the 
discussions to find out the truth begin. Rosada added that 
should we fail to reach an agreement on the uprooted people, 
"the government commission would be unwilling to recognize other 
proposals."

  [Text] The Government of Panama has protested to the U.S. 
Embassy because DEA agents held a meeting -- without prior 
Panamanian authorization -- at the border area of Puerto Obaldia 
with Colombian and Panamanian police officers to gather 
information on subversion and narcotics trafficking. 
  A Foreign Ministry document that contains a protest note 
from 
the Panamanian Government to the U.S. Government says that the 
meeting was held in the area of Puerto Obaldia, San Blas Indian 
territory. The note points out that the meeting was held on 15 
and 16 November 1992 when DEA agents Luis Mercado and Isaac 
Gallegos went to Puerto Obaldia and met with Colombian and 
Panamanian police officers. 
  During this meeting, which was not authorized by Panama, the 
DEA agents covered subjects such as narcotics trafficking, 
subversion, communications, weapons, police coordination between 
Panama and Colombia, and public health problems. According to 
the note, agents Mercado and Gallegos also visited several 
government offices in Puerto Obaldia, without receiving 
authorization from Panamanian officials or from the officials 
responsible for the various areas. 
  The Panamanian Foreign Ministry note advises the United 
States that all meetings of U.S. officials in Panama must be 
authorized first by Panamanian officials. The note adds that 
such actions could lead to an incident, inasmuch as the national 
authorities have orders not to allow foreign officials from 
holding meetings in national territory or gathering information 
without the prior authorization of the officials in charge.

created and run by soldiers of the Presidential Guard Battalion, 
is on the air beginning today. 
  The Presidential Guard Battalion no longer has to wake up to 
the sounds of reveille only. The soldiers now wake up to music 
played on 88.3 MHz, a frequency that identifies S5.9, a military 
radio station. 
  [Begin radio announcer Juan Carlos Ramirez recording] All of 
the equipment came from the Presidential Guard Battalion. In 
general, everyone ranging from colonels to captains contributed, 
including the soldiers. It all began when the soldiers started 
bringing their records. They brought their drawings representing 
the radio station. They brought microphones and equipment. The 
console came from the Presidential Guard Battalion. [end

  The radio station will reach all residents of Santa Fe de 
Bogota with variety shows, such as the War Tank, and the 
reveille beginning today. They hope to get civilians to listen 
to the radio station as well; this does not mean the radio 
station will ease up on military discipline. Here is what the 
colonel had to say: 
  [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Training is stronger 
now, but it is accompanied by psychology. These men are being

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Caribbean Common 
Market (Caricom) spoke out today in favor of stronger sanctions 
against Haiti to force the military to step down. It also 
stated it would approve an invasion to reestablish 
constitutional order. 
  Grenadian Denneth Modeste, president of the OAS Permanent 
Council, said "no course of action against the de facto 
government led by General Raoul Cedras can be ruled out." The 
possible military operation would have the approval of all 
Caricom member countries, Modeste affirmed. Modeste is 
participating in the 24th General Assembly, which will continue 
until 10 June in Belem, the capital city of the northern 
Brazilian state of Para. He recalled the U.S. military invasion 
of Grenada in 1983 "helped democracy." 
  Foreign ministers and representatives of 34 American nations 
rejected the Haitian military government's provisional president 
and announced a strengthening of economic sanctions against the 
Caribbean nation. The assembly approved a resolution presented 
by a special commission of OAS foreign ministers on 7 June. 
  The ministers reaffirmed their decision "not to recognize 
the 
authority of any acts executed by the de facto regime, including 
the illegal appointment of a provisional president on 11 May 
1994." The document calls for the organization's member nations 
to suspend all commercial flights to Haiti and comes one day 
after receiving approval from the United States for the measure. 
It also calls for the beginning of radio broadcasts in Creole 
beamed at the island. 
  The sanctions approved by the international organization 
include a trade embargo, the freezing of the military regime's 
assets, and the end to international financial operations with 
Haiti. These measures are a response to a military coup that 
occurred on 30 September 1991, led by Gen. Cedras, that toppled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide from power.

  [Text] Belem do Para, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, OAS Permanent 
Council President Denneth Modeste said the Caribbean member 
countries of Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] have not ruled 
out any option for reestablishing democracy in Haiti, including 
military intervention. 
  During a news conference in which he spoke on behalf of 
Caricom members, Modeste said that "if the sanctions do not 
attain the desired objective, we do not rule out any option" for 
reestablishing democracy in Haiti, including the military option. 
  "We believe the flagrant human rights violations against the 
poor Haitian people have been going on for too long," Modeste 
said, adding that before considering a military operation one 
should wait for the strengthening of the embargo against the 
Haitian coupists to see if this is effective. 
  Modeste, who represents Grenada before the OAS, added that 
the Caricom members have sent "a strong message to the Haitian 
authorities, and we expect them to respect their people's will 
to reestablish President Jean Bertrand Aristide in power." 
  During the OAS General Assembly taking place in this 
Brazilian coastal city, the foreign ministers of the OAS member 
countries approved a resolution to intensify the trade embargo 
against Haiti, asking for total compliance. Regarding the 
express prohibition against launching armed action against other 
countries, which is specified in the OAS Charter, Modeste said 
"it did not prevent the reestablishment of democracy in Grenada 
through military intervention." He said this in reference to 
the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. Modeste stressed the 
democratic progress attained in Grenada, adding that "for this 
reason Grenada does not rule out any action." 
  Despite the call for admitting Haitian refugees, as 
mentioned 
in the resolution on Haiti, Modeste said the Caricom countries 
cannot accept more of them because of the problems that many 
Caribbean countries have in offering them assistance and 
services. 
  "The problem of the refugees reflects what is going on in 
Haiti, and we must attempt to address the cause rather than the 
effects, and the cause is human rights violations in Haiti," 
Modeste said. 
  As for the possibility that Grenada could participate in a 
possible military operation against the Haitian coupists, who 
usurped power from Aristide in September 1991, Modeste said 
Grenada "does not have an Army," but would be willing to help 
train "a more responsible Haitian police" once the military 
return power to Aristide. 
  The Haitian crisis has been one of the central points 
discussed at the OAS General Assembly, which began on 6 June and 
could end tomorrow, a day earlier than scheduled, given the 
swiftness with which the various committees advanced in their 
work.

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- OAS Assistant Secretary 
General Christopher Thomas stated here today that so far none of 
the 34 OAS member countries have formally proposed Cuba's 
readmission into the organization. 
  Thomas, who represents Trinidad and Tobago, said OAS 
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares had proposed that Cuba's 
return to the OAS be discussed. He noted, however, that so far 
no country has made a formal request to this effect. 
  In accordance with OAS regulations, Thomas said, the 
readmission of a member country into the organization must first 
be formally proposed by one member country, and then consulted 
with the other members attending the General Assembly. 
  Thomas is actively participating in the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, which opened on 6 June in the Amazon city of Belem, in 
northern Brazil. He said: "As Baena Soares said, circumstances 
today are conducive to reexamining Cuba's readmission to the 
OAS, but so far I am unaware of any country having made such a 
proposal." 
  As assistant secretary general, Thomas will replace Baena 
Soares -- whose term expires this month, after having served 10 
years in office -- during the two-month period preceding the 
installation of the new secretary general-elect, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria. 
  Although some Latin American foreign ministers have timidly 
defended Baena Soares's proposal that the OAS member countries 
discuss the possibility of readmitting Cuba, only Argentina has 
formally stated its position on the issue; that is, its 
opposition to the proposal. 
  During a news conference Argentine OAS Ambassador Hernan 
Patino Meyer said flatly: "The OAS consists of democratic 
states, and as soon as Cuba takes steps toward its 
democratization it will be possible to readmit it into the 
organization." 
  Asked why Argentina and Brazil had, then, continued as OAS 
member states under the military regimes, Patino Meyer said that 
at that time the 1992 clause that provides for the separation 
from the OAS of nondemocratic states had not yet been approved. 
"Had I been the OAS secretary general at that time, I would 
have expelled Argentina and Brazil from the organization," 
Patino Mayer said. 
  In his opening speech at the 24th OAS General Assembly, 
Baena 
Soares said: "I have been asking for some time whether it is 
the right moment for the member countries to reexamine the 
decision they made more than 30 years ago to suspend the Cuban 
Government from OAS activities. The nineties are different from 
the sixties." 
  Baena Soares' proposal was not immediately discussed by the 
OAS foreign ministers because they were more interested in 
discussing the Haitian crisis. 
  Although President Itamar Franco did not discuss the Cuban 
issue in his speech at the OAS Assembly, he stated shortly 
before returning to Brasilia that "the OAS must look at the 
Cuban position." 
  Cuba was separated from the OAS in 1962, three years after 
the victory of the Cuban Revolution led by President Fidel 
Castro.

<F P=106> [By correspondent Walter Sotomayor] </F>
  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Mexico reiterated here 
today that it "automatically" rejects linking the topics of 
democracy, stability, and security of the hemisphere. Mexico 
also said it is pleased with the statements made in favor of 
putting an end to Cuba's isolation. 
  "As the Inter-American community is called upon to help 
democracy, it should promote the conditions that stimulate it," 
said Mexican Ambassador Jorge Pinto Mazal before the 24th OAS 
General Assembly. The Mexican under secretary for Latin 
America, cultural affairs, and cooperation, added that his 
country's delegation is very pleased to hear the pronouncements 
in favor of Cuba's participation in the inter-American system. 
He pointed out that Mexico's foreign policy is noted for 
favoring dialogue and agreement rather than exclusion and 
isolation. 
  The ambassador added that the principles of Mexican foreign 
policy were reinforced with a negotiated political solution to 
the crisis in Haiti and the proposals for an end to the 
isolation of Cuba which were presented by Canada and Brazil. 
"We are obviously pleased to see that other countries share 
this stand and do not want to see Cuba isolated," he said. 
Pinto Mazal heads the Mexican delegation that is attending the 
24th OAS General Assembly which will conclude on Friday in 
Belem, Para State, some 2,000 km north of Brasilia. 
  Yesterday, Brazil and Canada proposed ending the isolation 
of 
Cuba as a mechanism for promoting the "democratic transition" 
that "is already observed" on the Caribbean island. "We are all 
hoping for a democratic evolution in Cuba, with which Brazil 
maintains friendly relations," said Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim to the participants in the regional meeting. 
  The foreign minister said they have observed positive 
advances in the implementation of reforms in Cuba, which "should 
be increased," but rejected that economic and political 
isolation is the best way to contribute to the transition "that 
is starting to emerge." 
  During her remarks, Christine Stewart, the Canadian 
secretary 
of state for Latin American affairs, maintained that her country 
believes that "isolation, due to its nature, is not healthy; 
especially during this important transition phase in Cuba." 
Stewart added: "It is in our and the Cuban people's interest 
that we support the process of change on the island, which is 
positive and orderly." 
  On Wednesday, Pinto Meza underscored this, that experience 
has shown the ineffectiveness of the use of force as an 
instrument to resolve international conflicts. The lessons of 
the Cold War should be a reference to avoid the mistakes made in 
the past," he said. 
  He praised the work carried out for eight years by Brazilian 
diplomat Joao Baena Soares as the OAS secretary general. "He 
led the inter-American organization during particularly tense 
bipolar moments and during the unique Cold War situation," Pinto 
Meza added. 
  The Mexican diplomat also emphasized the importance that 
Mexico places on the advances made by the countries in social 
and economic development, the eradication of poverty, and 
combating drug trafficking activities. He presented Mexico's 
efforts toward commercial liberalization and economic 
integration and cautioned about the problems faced by people who 
look for jobs outside their place of origin. 
  Pinto Meza promised that his country would support all OAS 
organization activities to defend human rights and briefed the 
General Assembly on the establishment of impartial litigation in 
his country.

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (AE) -- Argentina will suggest to the 
OAS the creation of an Inter-American Defense Board to provide 
military advice to the OAS. Today, Argentine Ambassador to the 
OAS Hernan Patino said the board is not meant to be an armed 
branch of the OAS, but an advisory body that would be subject to 
the political decisions of the OAS. He denied that this 
proposal is connected with possible military intervention in 
Haiti. "Argentina has always been against any military 
intervention that is decided on a unilateral basis," he said. 
  Patino said the creation of an Inter-American Defense Board 
could avoid political embarrassments. He pointed out that the 
military interventions that have taken place in Latin America, 
like that in Nicaragua to guarantee peace during the elections, 
have had no legal basis. The board would serve exclusively for 
the discussion of military subjects and never as an intervention 
force. For example, one of its functions could be to sweep for 
mines placed in countries in conflict. 
  Tomorrow, the Chilean Government will present to the OAS a 
proposal to create a work group to analyze government corruption 
and to suggest a code of laws to combat corruption. Chilean 
Ambassador to Brazil Heraldo Munoz said the economic development 
of the countries of the region is what is mainly responsible for 
the expansion of corruption in the continent. "Corruption must 
be faced as a phenomenon that goes beyond national borders," he 
said. 
  This work group should analyze the laws against corruption 
of 
the OAS member countries and should include some of them in a 
code of laws that would be approved by the OAS. Argentine 
Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino said that corruption does 
not take place in Latin America only, mentioning recent cases in 
Japan, Italy, and Spain. 
  Tomorrow, Brazil will present a resolution ratifying 
Argentina's rights over the Malvinas Islands (or the Falklands, 
to the British). Brazil presents the same resolution in favor of 
Argentina at all OAS assemblies. "Argentina will always claim, 
in a peaceful manner at all international forums, its 
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands," Patino said.

  [Excerpt] Belem, Para (Brazil), 7 Jun (EFE) -- During a 
speech to the 24th OAS General Assembly on 7 June, Bolivian 
Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga stated that the 
Bolivian Government hopes that this year it will start holding 
talks with Chile on the problem of Bolivia's land-locked 
situation. 
  Aranibar said: "We believe there are new conditions to 
tackle 
the issue of our aspirations to an outlet to the sea." He 
reported that the presidents of both countries will discuss the 
issue during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of 
government and state to be held in the Colombian city of 
Cartagena de Indias on 14-15 June. 
  The Bolivian foreign minister asserted that "in the course 
of 
the meetings that (Bolivian) President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada 
held with Chilean presidential candidates before the elections, 
including then-candidate Eduardo Frei, he sensed that Chile was 
more willing to discuss that issue." 
  Bolivia's land-locked situation was on the agenda of the 
24th 
OAS General Assembly, which was inaugurated in Belem, a city in 
Para State in the Amazon, on 6 June. This issue was discussed 
by the foreign ministers of the two countries involved. 
  This question has been included on the agenda of all OAS 
General Assemblies since 1979 at the request of Bolivia and 
despite the fact that Chile has always objected to it. The 
Bolivian claim has been endorsed in the last few years by 11 OAS 
resolutions. 
  In his address to the foreign ministers and chiefs of 
delegations of the 34 OAS member countries, the Bolivian foreign 
minister asserted that his country has the right to ask the 
international community to discuss Bolivia's possibility of 
having an outlet to the sea and to give it the same treatment as 
the cases of Palestine, South Africa, and Haiti. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano stated that 
his country's stance is based on respect for the principle of 
nonintervention and faithful compliance with the treaties on 
that matter. He said: "We would like once again to insist at 
this meeting on the legal arguments that prove that our claim is 
valid." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Belem -- Yesterday, the OAS member countries 
meeting in Belem do Para approved several new sanctions against 
Haiti, with the purpose of putting overthrown President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide back in power. Suspending commercial 
flights to Haiti and freezing the bank accounts held abroad by 
the members of the coupist Haitian government are included among 
the sanctions. [passage omitted] 
  The following are the main points agreed upon at the OAS 
General Assembly: 

  -  To condemn the interruption of the 
Haitian democratic system and not to recognize any authority 
that has come to power as a result of actions carried out by the 
regime currently in power, including the illegal appointment of 
a provisional president on 11 May. 
  -  To reiterate the need for the 
UN and OAS member countries to support and strengthen the 
embargo measures, such as the suspension of commercial flights 
to Haiti and the freezing of the assets maintained abroad by the 
regime and its members. 
  -  To exhort the member countries and the 
international community to help face the problem of the Haitian 
people who abandon their country with great risk to their lives; 
and to help these immigrants and offer them temporary 
protection. 
  -  To condemn the persistent maneuvers by the coupist 
officials and their political and financial allies to intimidate 
and gain time. 
  -  To condemn persecution and repression in Haiti 
and the retaliations against those who favor the reinstatement 
of democracy in the country, in addition to condemning obstacles 
to freedom of assembly and expression. 
  -  To increase the number of 
observer members of the civilian UN and OAS mission so as to 
cover the whole of Haitian territory. 
  -  To recognize the support 
shown by countries which used to maintain economic and trade 
relations with Haiti, but which suspended them to implement the 
OAS resolutions.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonia Marcia Vale from Belem, Para State] </F>
  [Text] The OAS will hold its next general assembly in 
Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti. The decision was 
made today at a plenary session of the OAS General Assembly in 
Belem by all of the 34 OAS member countries. 
  Haiti has been ruled by a military dictatorship since 1991, 
when Army coupists ousted the first elected president since the 
downfall of a previous dictatorship that had lasted 
approximately 50 years. 
  OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares has described the 
OAS 
General Assembly's decision as unequivocal proof of a clear 
political will to resolve the Haitian crisis. In his opinion, 
the holding of the general assembly in Haiti will be 
instrumental in confirming the restoration of democracy in that 
country.

  [Excerpts] Belem, 9 Jun (AE) -- The 24th OAS General 
Assembly will close here on 10 June. The 34 OAS member states 
have described its results as positive and quite significant, 
especially in the area of human rights. OAS Secretary General 
Joao Baena Soares characterized the approval of an 
inter-American convention to prevent, punish, and eradicate the 
use of violence against women -- which was already signed by 
five countries, Brazil included -- and of an inter-American 
convention on the forcible disappearance of people, namely 
political activists, as "extremely significant for the future of 
the continent." [passage omitted] 
  In addition to the above two conventions, Baena Soares also 
mentioned the adoption of a resolution proposing greater 
cooperation for hemispheric security and limiting the 
proliferation of instruments of war, a proposal to create an 
inter-American defense board, and another proposal containing 
measures to improve the inter-American program to preserve the 
environment. 
  Baena Soares said: "I could not have asked for better and 
more significant results at the Belem meeting." He added: "The 
decisions made here are proof that the OAS is increasingly 
becoming a forum in which all countries in the hemisphere can 
discuss political and economic issues and other types of issues 
as well."
