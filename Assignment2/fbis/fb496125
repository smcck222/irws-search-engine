  [Text] Belem do Para, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim today revealed that one of the proposals 
Brazil has made for the so-called Summit of the Americas is the 
creation of a special fund to finance integration processes in 
the continent. 
  Brazil believes that one way to prevent the presidential 
summit organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton from ending in 
another declaration of principles would be to propose concrete 
projects for action and promotion of hemispheric integration, 
Amorim said. 
  One of the projects, Amorim said, could be the creation of a 
specific fund within the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) 
to help finance economic integration processes in the continent. 
  "Integration processes are essential for our country, and it 
is important to have the resources with which to carry them 
out," Amorim said during a news conference he gave on the 
occasion of the 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been taking 
place since 6 June in Belem do Para, northern Brazil. 
  According to Amorim, who mentioned this proposal to Strobe 
Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, during a meeting they 
held on 6 June, the IDB was created precisely as an instrument 
of support for Latin American integration. 
  The resources from this fund could help the integration 
processes that have been developing in the past few years, such 
as the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact, 
the Group of Three, and the Amazon Integration Treaty, among 
others. 
  Another proposal that will be made by Brazil for the Summit 
of the Americas, which will be held from 9 to 10 December in 
Miami, Florida, is to create mechanisms for financial and 
technical cooperation in the field of human rights defense. 
  Human rights conditions could improve with financial and 
technical cooperation agreements to improve the living 
conditions of prison inmates and strengthen the judicial system, 
Celso Amorim said.

  [Text] Montevideo, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Uruguayan Foreign 
Minister Sergio Abreu said the Chilean proposal to establish, 
along with the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), a free 
trade zone "needs to ripen." The minister said he hopes this 
proposal "will not harm the trade benefits established for the 
signatory countries of the Asuncion Treaty," which in March 1991 
gave rise to Mercosur -- comprising Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, 
and Uruguay. 
  While in Belem do Para (Brazil), where he is participating 
in 
the OAS General Assembly, Abreu told the Montevideo newspaper EL 
OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that the Chilean proposal to join Mercosur 
within a free trade zone has in principle been well received by 
the Uruguayan Government. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa announced on 6 June 
in Belem do Para that, within 10 years, his country will 
establish a free trade zone with Mercosur. Today, he formalized 
the proposal in a document he presented in Buenos Aires to 
Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, the current Mercosur 
council president. 
  Abreu stressed: "The Chilean proposal needs to ripen because 
it only expresses a political will. A concrete proposal is 
required on the deadlines and the scope of the association 
sought by the government of President Eduardo Frei." 
  The Chilean announcement was well received from a political 
viewpoint because it is a step forward in the regional economic 
integration. It is necessary to hear the proposal's technical 
aspects before giving an official response. 
  Abreu admitted that any proposed "violation" of the common 
external tariff system, which the four Mercosur partners will 
strenuously attempt to establish next month, would be 
unacceptable. He added that the Uruguayan viewpoint is shared 
by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. 
  Uruguay considers unacceptable any trade agreement which 
enables another country to have privileged access to the 
seizable Argentine and Brazilian markets without paying the same 
common external tariff that must be borne by the two other 
Mercosur members.

  [Text] Cochabamba -- The preparatory meeting for the 
International Decade of the World's Indigenous People, with the 
participation of delegates from Latin America and the Caribbean, 
has proposed a program for establishing a new order of relations 
with indigenous people. 
  Several proposals were made during the closing ceremony of 
this important international event, which was attended by Vice 
President Victor Hugo Cardenas, Foreign Minister Antonio 
Aranibar, and Nobel Peace Prize winner Rigoberta Menchu. 
  The three-day event, which ended on the evening of 1 June, 
proposed that the new order of relations with indigenous 
communities guarantee the recognition of the indigenous identity 
and the historical rights of their political, juridical, 
economic, social, and cultural institutions. 
  It must also guarantee the total and free participation of 
the indigenous communities in all aspects of society, and 
especially in the issues that concern them. 
  These and other recommendations will be proposed to the 
United Nations next December in an effort to prepare a 
declaration of the International Decade of World Indigenous 
Communities. 
  Another proposal calls for strict compliance with the 
necessary measures to intensify the struggle against racism and 
against the cultural, linguistic, racial, and religious 
discrimination affecting the indigenous communities. 
  Also in coordination with the organizations and institutions 
of the indigenous communities, a decision was made to adopt new 
necessary measures to guarantee the adequate participation of 
the indigenous communities in the distribution of the budget of 
each country, to eradicate poverty and isolation. 
  Another proposal advocates the implementation of national 
policies for distribution of land, education, employment, 
technical assistance, protection of traditional economies, and 
sustainable ecological development, respecting the tradition of 
the indigenous communities, in order to improve their standard 
of living. 
  The conclusions of the meeting also recommend the protection 
of the beliefs and rituals of the indigenous communities as an 
expression of their basic right to their cultural identity and 
to allow the indigenous communities access to the media to 
promote their culture and their opinion of society. 
  The specific resolutions of the indigenous communities of 
Latin America and the Caribbean will seek free participation in 
the decisionmaking process for all aspects of society. The 
Fides news agency listed the following resolutions: 
  -- Make express recognition, through the implementation of 
constitutional, legislative, and administrative measures, of the 
responsibility and historical rights of the indigenous 
communities established within states, as well as of the rights 
resulting from international treaties and agreements. 
  -- Establish effective equal mechanisms for the negotiation 
and solution of conflicts that may develop between the 
indigenous communities and the non-indigenous sector (public or 
private) of society, including the possible violation of the 
individual or collective human rights of those communities. 
  -- Establish one day of each year as an official day for 
public awareness of indigenous dignity, and study the 
possibility of establishing in penal legislation harsh penalties 
for those who commit acts harmful to the dignity of indigenous 
communities. 
  -- Adopt measures to ensure the total eradication of 
discriminatory policies and practices on labor matters.

<F P=106> [Article by Francis Van den Berghe: "Belgium Trying To Talk </F>
Asylum Seekers Into Leaving Embassy"] 
  [Excerpts] The occupation of the Belgian Embassy in Havana 
by more than 100 Cuban asylum seekers, was still deadlocked on 
Wednesday [8 June]. The main obstacle was the asylum seekers' 
persistent refusal to leave the building. The Belgian 
authorities continued to try to convince them to do so. 
According to Havana, the Belgian authorities submitted a list 
with 121 names to the Cuban authorities. On Wednesday, a 
Brussels communique stated that there were 124 Cubans in the 
embassy. 
  The Cuban Foreign Ministry announced it would not resort to 
violence to chase the intruders from the Belgian ambassador's 
residence. "It is up to Belgium to take action," the Cuban 
Embassy spokesman in Brussels stated. Brussels and Havana fully 
agree on the position to be taken. "Belgium should try and talk 
the intruders into leaving," spokesmen said. 
  Brussels sent Willy Verriest, former Belgian ambassador in 
Havana, as a special envoy to Cuba. According to the Belgian 
Foreign Ministry, this is necessary because of the problems the 
Belgian Embassy is experiencing with simultaneously negotiating 
with the Cuban authorities, convincing the intruders, and 
finding food for 124 people. [passage omitted] 
  Both countries agree that all legal procedures for traveling 
abroad should be respected. Since Cuba has promised not to 
prosecute the intruders for unlawful entry, Belgium is trying to 
make them leave. [passage omitted] 
  During the present incident, Belgium has not issued any 
statements about human rights. Shortly after the embassy 
takeover, Foreign Minister Claes said that "the intruders should 
not have any false illusions." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The violent incidents that have taken place in 
recent days because of illegal departures from the country 
highlight the harmful effects of the immigration policy of the 
United States, a place where certain Cubans would like to go, 
whether temporarily or permanently, but they are prevented from 
traveling there because of obstacles erected by Washington. 
  The Cuban Foreign Ministry has explained the reasons for 
tightening security measures around some embassies in Havana 
following the forceful entry by 121 Cubans into the Belgian 
ambassador's residence, from where they are demanding to be 
permitted to leave the country. 
  The Foreign Ministry has also reported that two Canadian 
citizens were arrested because of their participation in an 
illegal departure attempt that resulted in the death of two 
people. 
  Saturday [4 June], a group of Cubans seized a sand barge in 
the port of Mariel. This action resulted in an incident in 
which a National Border Guard boat pursued the vessel until it 
reached international waters. 
  At the end of May, a Cuban couple died after being swindled 
by a person who convinced them that he could guide them through 
the mine fields around Guantanamo Naval Base, where they were 
attempting to go in a bid to reach the United States. Both 
within and outside of Cuba, there are those who encourage 
illegal departures of people who do not believe they can travel 
to the United States legally. 
  In 1993, only some 1,600 Cubans received visas to travel to 
the United States directly, despite a bilateral agreement that 
permits the granting of 20,000 visas annually. More than 60 
percent of the visa requests from people under the age of 40 are 
rejected each year by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
Coincidentally, most of the people who cross the Straits of 
Florida in fragile boats are young people between the ages of 20 
and 30. 
  It should not be overlooked that some Cubans are attracted 
to 
the United States because of the possibility of improving their 
economic situation. They try to get there by any means, leaving 
behind undeniable limitations in Cuba. 
  As a result of the Readjustments Act, any Cuban, regardless 
of his reasons for or mode of arriving in the United States, can 
receive refugee status in that country. All these people have 
to do is reach U.S. territory and stay there for one year. 
  As long as the United States grants these privileges and 
prevents those Cubans who adhere to legitimate procedures from 
traveling to the United States for economic reasons or to visit 
their relatives, drastic actions that almost always end 
tragically will be possible.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Pedro Pradas from the "Exclusive" program] </F>
  [Text] In the past few weeks, there have been changes to 
the script, aggressive changes that reflect a typically cunning 
nature. The Miami press, with the backing of important 
international news agencies, report an insuperable Cuban 
political crisis. What a simple [ingenua] coincidence to invent 
such a scandal just days before the fourth Ibero-American 
summit; reports of illegal departures and naval piracy all aimed 
at mocking the Cuban-U.S. international immigration laws. 
  Undoubtedly, these are excellent arguments that groups of 
anti-Cubans living abroad and on the extreme right will use to 
unleash a campaign of orgiastic accusations against Cuba, its 
people's revolution and its leader, and to create a parallel 
show to [word indistinct] the Cuban people from the impact of 
the agreements, dialogues, and integration that will take place 
among the region's presidents. 
  I will not mince words: No economic crisis can be sorted out 
without creating political and social problems, but the 
difference between the truth and their statement of an 
insuperable Cuban political crisis is so great that only the 
most supine, ill-intentioned ignorance, together with a desire 
to molest, could repeat such information, as some news agencies 
have. 
  Furthermore, even a dimwit can clearly see that, one way or 
another, these agencies have received instructions, especially 
the Spanish-speaking television stations, to ignore everything, 
or almost everything, about the Cartagena de Indias summit. To 
do this, they report -- as one of those stations did last night 
-- that Colombia is only interested in its soccer team's 
performance in the World Cup and in the Cauca tragedy. 
  In the same way, there's an almost funereal silence about 
the 
OAS Assembly in Brazil, where Cuba's reintegration into the 
hemispheric organization has been strongly supported by many. 
It is the same silence that surrounds the activities that 
dozens of Cuban and U.S. organizations have been carrying out to 
participate in a demonstration against the blockade on Cuba. 
  The obvious needs no refutation, but consumers should at 
least receive a modest explanation that saves them from being 
clients of such a deplorable enterprise. Perhaps it would be 
proper to warn them using Jose Marti's words: In politics, the 
most important thing is what is not seen.

newscast] 
  [Text] With five days to go until the beginning of the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Cartagena de Indias is the stage 
of intense preparation work. 
  The Ibero-American Justice Ministers Meeting in Cartagena is 
analyzing judicial cooperation, measures to fight organized 
crime, and family welfare. The goal is to put law and justice to 
the service of integration through cooperation accords. 
  [Andres Martinez, Colombian minister of justice; identified 
by caption] "Integration can be devoid of content if it is not 
accompanied by precise judicial norms. Normative dispersion can 
become an acute obstacle for progress in the field of 
integration." 
  Regarding this meeting, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat 
pointed out Cuba's potential contribution to the meeting. 
  [Amat] "We have brought the example of our organization 
regarding subjects that I believe are extremely important: the 
family; the problem of abandoned children; the problem of 
adoption. These issues are included in the summit. We have 
significant experience in these fields." 
  Amat also spoke about the interest that these issues might 
spark among participants in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. 
  [Amat] "The repercussions these might have lie basically in 
acceptance by the states involved in the results of this work, 
the search for a common denominator in the legal and legislative 
character to make law the guiding force in relations among 
countries, and of course, to seek by this path a strengthening 
of ties and greater integration, which is the end goal." 
  Cuban Ambassador Jesus Martinez described the relations 
between the two nations as satisfactory. He made these 
statements during a solidarity meeting with Cuba held in 
Barranquilla and attended by representatives of unions and the 
Colombian Workers Federation. 
  [Martinez] "The Colombian Government has taken the step of 
reestablishing ties with Cuba. It seems to us that it is only 
fair that we see this step as positive." 
  Cuba and Colombia reestablished diplomatic and commercial 
ties in October 1990, and between January and April 1994, Cuban 
imports topped the list of Colombia's imports. These exports 
have grown 16-fold in this quarter and totalled $21 million. 
Colombia imports Cuban steel, salt, generic medicine, vaccine, 
and biotechnology products. 
  Regarding negotiations for Colombian oil, Ambassador 
Martinez 
explained: 
  [Martinez] "The procedure is established. There is political 
will, but as of now, there is no accord to conduct this type of 
project. We do think that either now or later, by direct 
purchase or through oil refining, we have the technical 
conditions and possibilities to develop this type of relation." 
  During the meeting, the Colombian union leaders expressed 
interest in the Cuban reality and their support for Cuba. 
  [Unidentified speaker] "Viva socialist Cuba! [Crowd: Viva!] 
Viva socialist Cuba! [repeats] [Crowd: Viva!] Down with the 
economic blockade of Cuba! [Crowd: Down with it!] Viva the unity 
of the Colombian people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the unity of the 
Cuban people! [Crowd: Viva!] Viva the solidarity of the Cuban 
and Colombian peoples! [Crowd: Viva!] Fighting united! [Crowd: 
We will win!] Fighting united! [Crowd: We will win!] [repeats].

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz, first secretary 
of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], met with the CPC 
delegation headed by Politburo member Wu Banggou. During the 
meeting, the Cuban president recalled the visit by Chinese 
President Jiang Zemin to Cuba in 1993. 
  On 9 June, Politburo member Carlos Lage accompanied the CPC 
delegation of a tour of the Expocuba facilities on the outskirts 
of Havana. The Chinese delegation was greeted in Expocuba's main 
hall by a group of children who performed traditional Cuban 
dances and who invited several members of the Chinese delegation 
to join them. Wu Banggou expressed interest in the exhibits in 
the various pavilions showcasing Cuba's accomplishments in 
numerous sectors such as the economy, science, education, and 
others. 
  The high-level CPC delegation met with PCC and government 
leaders and has visited sites of economic and historic interest. 
On 10 June, the delegation will travel beyond Havana to see the 
economic development plans of several Cuban provinces firsthand.

  Previously, the CPC delegation had seen a video covering the 
work done at the hospital. The hospital has 52 consulting rooms 
for diverse medical specialities to care for the population, 
mainly from Centro Habana and Habana Vieja. Later on, the CPC 
delegation visited various areas of the hospital and expressed 
interest in other aspects of Cuban medicine.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondents Mario Rivera and Marta Moreno from </F>
the NTV newscast] 
  [Text] Army General Raul Castro visited Tank Unit 1410 in 
Matanzas Province during his tour of Central Army facilities. 
The unit's troops worked hard to build defensive tunnels and to 
fortify positions for correctly conserving all weaponry and 
protecting soldiers and the population. 
  The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba assessed 
the importance of these facilities in protecting weaponry and 
soldiers in case of enemy air raids. Raul Castro's words are 
known: We may not be the Armed Forces with the most available 
resources, but we can say that we are the best protected Armed 
Forces on the continent; therefore, they are the most 
enthusiastic and are capable of coming from beneath the Earth's 
surface after a surprise, large- scale air raid and making the 
enemy pay dearly for trying to land on our island. 
  Unit Chief Colonel Lazaro Lopez said the troops are prepared 
for combat readiness through various exercises and the use of 
schoolrooms, maquettes, and trainers, as well as through gunnery 
practice and the use of shooting ranges. This results in a 
considerable savings of human and material resources, including 
fuel. 
  The young men in the unit excel in various patriotic and 
social activities: minimizing misdemeanors and eliminating the 
need for discipline violations, strengthening personnel support 
to their leaders, and proving to be active participants in 
essential tasks. 
  Agrarian development represents another important task for 
this tank unit, in its zeal to achieve self-sufficiency. They 
currently have two basic production units, a pig farm, a poultry 
farm and its slaughterhouse, a cattle farm, and a fodder 
factory. A total of 20 tanks are being built to breed fish. Out 
of 160 medical products that can be manufactured with herbs, the 
unit has managed to manufacture 125 products in a small 
laboratory, thus fulfilling basic needs at the unit's hospital. 
In addition to their work, these fighters have had time to 
support vital economic tasks, including the potato harvest, the 
sugarcane recovery, and the cleaning of Varadero beach. They 
are also in charge of the military community and its elementary 
school and excel in valuable blood donations.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lourdes Mijan, director of the Havana City </F>
Province waterworks directorate, by correspondents Heidi 
Gonzalez Cabrera and Cesar Arredondo in Havana; from the 
"Exclusive" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Gonzalez] An important meeting just ended at the 
offices of the provincial waterworks directorate. The meeting 
was chaired by Director Lourdes Mijan and included many 
municipal representatives. One of the topics, among others of 
great interest, was preparations for the tariff and metering 
system that will go into effect on 1 October. I was hoping you 
could tell us more about this. 
  [Mijan] We are currently preparing for the preparatory work 
needed before 1 October, when we are supposed to start charging 
for water with the tariffed service. The metering system will 
remain in effect in Havana -- that is, those who have meters 
will be charged according to the meter. We will incorporate 
those who have broken meters or those who do not have metered 
service into a fixed rate system. 
  People with metered service have the advantage that if they 
conserve water, they may not have to pay anything because the 
limit is 100 liters per person per day -- that is, those who 
have working meters will only have to pay for sewage service, 
which is 30 cents per person in cases where they are connected 
to the sewage service. In case they do not have this service, 
then they will only be charged for metered water consumption 
when it exceeds 100 liters. As for the rest of the population, 
they will be charged a fixed rate at one peso per person plus 30 
cents for sewage where they are receiving that service. 
  [Gonzalez] I do not have time to cover everything our 
listeners would like to know, but I think it would be important 
if you spoke about those zones that are traditionally without 
water, such as some areas of Habana Vieja, Centro Habana... 
  [Arredondo, interrupting] We can continue this topic 
tomorrow 
if you feel it is necessary. It is fine if you can finish 
today, but we can extend the report until tomorrow if you need 
more time. 
  [Gonzalez] It would be a pleasure, but that is something 
that 
Lourdes must decide. We will talk about this at the end. Many 
people are waiting for this information. What more can you tell 
us? 
  [Mijan] We are currently having difficulties with the water 
service, difficulties caused by this situation because of the 
period of the year. We are just entering spring. 
  Rainfall in Havana City was very bad last year. We only had 
79 percent of our standard average rainfall. We are entering 
spring, when there are always many difficulties with the water 
supplies. 
  [Gonzalez] Excuse me, but there is some confusion among the 
population. They believe that when it rains, there should not 
be a water shortage. 
  [Mijan] The problem is that the water supplies do not 
recover 
that fast. It will take one month before we feel the effects of 
the spring rains and our water supplies will recover. 
  Right now, we are having the greatest difficulties in Centro 
Habana and Habana Vieja because we have a deficit of 90,456 
cubic meters per day for the area of Centro Habana compared to 
last year's figures. This great deficit is also caused by other 
water sources that supply water to the capital, which at the 
moment have low water levels. 
  We have made adjustments to the water supply operations in 
the municipalities that have the greatest water supply problems. 
We have begun working on a schedule in some places -- such as 
Vedado, Plaza de la Revolucion, and Diez de Octubre -- in an 
attempt to conserve water for the two municipalities with the 
greatest problems. As far as this goes, we believe our sources 
should recover in the next 15 to 20 days and that the situation 
will be, more or less, normal. 
  [Gonzalez] I have been following the meeting that just 
ended. 
We know of the efforts, the achievements, and the solutions that 
are about to be implemented. Can you be with us tomorrow? 
  [Mijan] I will have to make an extra effort because I had 
other things planned for tomorrow. Nevertheless, I will try to 
be here tomorrow to give you more information on the metered 
service and the water supply. 
  [Gonzalez] Friends, that is all for today. We will continue 
tomorrow.

  [Text] The administrative council in Havana Province has 
announced that the water supply has been stabilized in the 
municipalities and that 96 percent of the population is 
receiving this service. Havana Province, second only to Havana 
City Province, has a network of 470 aqueducts. 
  The largest water supply problem is in Madruga Municipality 
and conditions are slated to improve in Santa Cruz del Norte 
Municipality. Despite increased efforts over the last year, and 
the help which the agriculture sector has provided to the 
schools, the main problems are found in boarding schools, where 
54 pumps are in bad shape, with 29 of them no longer functioning 
at all. In order to alleviate this problem, Havana's school 
board established a program keyed towards installing water 
systems in those schools.

  [Text] Approximately 10,000 craftsmen registered as 
self-employed workers in Havana will be reregistered this month 
by the municipal labor committees and will be assigned new 
categories, according to their work. Manuel Fernandez, 
provincial labor and social security director, stated that the 
labor committees and local industries are visiting every worker 
included in this category to determine the veracity of their 
employment and to assign the new categories. 
  The regulation requires that in order to be certified as 
self-employed, the worker has to personally make the products, 
without using middlemen and without employing salaried workers. 
From now on, only those people who manually and singlehandedly 
make items will be registered as craftsmen. These workers will 
be required to acquire their raw materials and market their 
products through the municipal enterprises of the local 
industries sector. 
  The decision of the Havana's Administrative Council 
established a monthly license fee of 100 pesos, but no 
registration fee will be required.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Act Now as Committed Protagonists of the </F>
Accorded Policy"] 
  [Text] The accord reached at the recent special session of 
our National Assembly contains the fitting policy which we have 
chosen to mend the domestic finances and eliminate currency 
excesses, which today, as we all know, is the obstacle we have 
to overcome to reorganize and foster our economic development. 
  This policy, which ought to help to put behind us the 
current 
crisis and move ahead, took shape mainly thanks to the debates 
of the Parliaments in the Workplace. 
  Therefore, Cuban workers have been the main protagonists of 
this accord. The accord contains the essence of the main 
proposals, concerns, and points of view expressed in those broad 
and democratic debates. The ultimate goal of this policy is to 
defend the interests of the workers and the workers' 
revolutionary government and their accomplishments in every 
field. 
  This is why it is the duty of the Cuban workers, 
particularly 
our working class, now to play an unparalleled leading role in 
implementing this policy. 
  This is the beginning, as Comrade Fidel pointed out so well, 
of the most difficult part of this effort. It will require the 
understanding and support of all the people, timely information, 
and much discipline and determination. It will also require 
rigorous order in implementing the measures and the necessary 
time so that the government and the entities of the state 
involved can make decisions and organize its implementation. 
This is not a one-day thing but a long process linked to other 
economic, organizational, labor, and salary steps. It relies on 
every workplace's resolute commitment to work harder and more 
efficiently. 
  The significant step that has been taken encourages all of 
us. It is important, however, not to harbor false hopes. While 
consistent implementation of the accorded policy will help 
reactivate the economy in the medium and long term, it does not 
mean that the country will have more resources, food, medicine, 
raw materials, fuel, electricity, or transportation available in 
the short term. 
  We must keep in mind that we are beginning a program to mend 
domestic finances, the results of which, as has been said, will 
not be felt in the short term nor right away. 
  It is important to note that we will be implementing this as 
the U.S. Government continues to impose its cruel and ironclad 
blockade on us. The blockade has already cost over $41 billion. 
Figures indicate that the blockade, last year alone, deprived 
us of 40 percent of the hard currency we could have accrued with 
the existing level of production and exports. 
  We will implement this policy and the unavoidable groundwork 
to attain our remaining goals in the midst of the harsh 
conditions which our country faces following the abrupt loss of 
the market and favorable prices secured from the former USSR and 
the countries of the European socialist bloc for Cuban sugar, 
nickel, citrus crops, and other products. It is a known fact 
that that brutal blow diminished our import capacity from $8.2 
billion in 1989 to less than $2 billion in 1993. 
  In other words, we must solve the excess currency problems 
within Cuba's current conditions with barely 23 percent of the 
resources that were available four years ago, without foreign 
credits for development, and upholding the principles of human 
solidarity and justice which have guided our steps at this 
difficult junction of the special period. None of these 
realities will be immediately changed by the steps we are taking 
and will take. 
  Of course, by revaluing salaries and gradually recovering 
the 
Cuban peso's purchasing power, the current policy will serve to 
encourage work, labor discipline, and productive efficiency. Its 
most immediate effect, however, will be on the currency in 
circulation and not production. This will not result in 
resources being more available in the short term. 
  We must also be aware that we will be heading toward a 
period in which this policy will cause more sacrifices in the 
family's economy, meaning more expenses and cash payments, 
without the simultaneous possibility of restoring the levels of 
material consumption, electricity, and transportation needed. 
  Once again, the virtue of implementing this accord does not 
lie in freeing us of those inevitable sacrifices but in laying 
the groundwork to make the sacrifices more effective and to 
yield what we want. 
  Take the case of energy: The country needs to spend at least 
$800 million a year to provide the nearly 6 million tons of fuel 
that we use today, less than half of what we had available four 
years ago. This means that we invest nearly half of all the 
hard currency in energy reources. If we consider the fact that 
the country needs to allocate at least another $500 million to 
import food and considerable -- though insufficient -- amounts 
for medicine, raw materials, materials, and key equipment, like 
spare parts and components to maintain the thermoelectric plants 
and the distribution network, we can clearly see that it is 
impossible to think of having more electricity or more 
transportation services today. 
  Our sugar fields would need at least $54 million in 
fertilizer this year to be able to increase the yield and to 
accelerate the sugar industry's recovery. Yet, the country will 
only be able to allocate 24 percent of the resources to this 
end, which will be allocated following a very strict criteria of 
efficiency. Producing vegetables, tubers, and cattle requires a 
minimum of $136 million in fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, and 
other basic products. These are only a few basic examples. 
Similar difficulties and shortages of resources prevail in all 
other economic sectors. 
  It is essential for the workers to be well informed and 
aware 
of the nature of the problems we face so that they can avoid 
false expectations and can firmly support the idea that only 
with more work and efficiency -- with an increase in tireless 
efforts to realize the production potential in every factory, 
workshop, or farm -- can we ease the harsh consequences of the 
special period. 
  The assemblies for efficiency that we have started as a 
means 
to give continuity to the spirit and method of the workers' 
parliament need to be an efficient tool to keep progressing in 
that direction. 
  The goal is to fully utilize a new method that will 
strengthen the unity of the workers, the administration, and 
union and political leaders in the search for the most adequate 
ways to: reduce subsidies and costs; employ the labor force 
rationally; guarantee strict control of material and financial 
resources; take care of the food and service needs of the 
workplace; increase discipline; and demand efficiency in all 
productive, teaching, scientific, and service endeavors. 
  These assemblies are committed to offering substantial 
economic contributions in a systematic and stable way, thus 
contributing decisively to revaluing the salary and our national 
currency. 
  The fact that our National Assembly has pointed to the 
importance of those assemblies in its historic accord and has 
advised the representatives, provincial and municipal delegates, 
and the popular councils to get closely involved with them is 
more than an acknowledgement. It is a reason for commitment 
that should motivate us to ensure that these assemblies are 
conducted with the highest quality. 
  In the same sense, we could say something similar of the 
guidelines issued by the government's leadership to the 
ministers and leaders of the organizations of the state central 
administration and to the presidents of the provincial 
administrative councils. 
  Our government, on behalf of all the people, now has the 
complex and sensitive mission of steering and executing the 
program of measures that it deems appropriate. With the 
intelligence, perseverance, serenity, and courage that 
characterizes our political and administrative leadership, 
everything necessary will be done to solve the problems without 
falling short and to guarantee the Revolution's strategic course. 
  This does not mean in any way that the role of the workers 
and their unions will diminish. On the contrary, the 
mobilization, support, creative initiative, and political 
strength of the working class and the people will be more 
important and decisive than ever. 
  This is the Revolution of the workers, as Fidel has 
reiterated, and we have gathered here to adopt those measures 
that will help save the Revolution of the workers. 
  Let us work so that these assemblies prove to be useful 
opportunities to evaluate how our daily efforts toward 
efficiency are progressing, to discuss new proposals that we can 
put into practice, to clear misunderstandings and doubts among 
the workers, and to exercise, after all, our indeclinable 
prerogatives as the owners of the means of production. 
  Let us turn this first assembly for efficiency into a forum 
where we clearly express the workers' and the Cuban union 
movement's support for the policies that, in an exemplary, 
democratic, and participative way, we just drafted and, in a 
very special way, for the measures issued by our Council of 
State toward expropriating the ill-gotten goods hoarded by the 
speculators and thieves who in a despicable way work to build 
fortunes from the shortages and sufferings of the people. 
  All the patriotism, all the capacity for struggle, all the 
spirit of combat of the workers: To support as a single man our 
government, the Revolution, and Fidel in the heroic effort to 
overcome the present difficulties and move ahead with the 
honorable flags of the free, nonrelinquishable, just, and 
socialist fatherland. 
  [The following notice accompanies this editorial: "The text 
of this editorial will be read at the beginning of the 
Assemblies for Economic Efficiency, which will be held in every 
workplace nationwide beginning 16 May."]

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F>
BOHEMIA magazine and Luis Sexto of BOHEMIA magazine; date not 
given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Good afternoon, friends. This is 
Straight Talk here on Radio Rebelde. If the economic measures 
are good, why do they affect me? Luis Sexto and yours truly, 
Osvaldo Rodriguez, both of BOHEMIA magazine, will talk straight 
here about this topic. Luis, I think many good people are asking 
this question. They have yet to understand why they must be 
affected during this phase. In fact, many people are talking 
about this and are even feeling some rejection of the measures. 
They ask: Why? Why do I have to continue sacrificing? 
  I recently spoke with a young woman with a 19-year-old son. 
She faces a very difficult economic situation because they live 
on her salary and the meager salary her son recently began to 
earn. She has to face a black market that, as we all know, 
swindles people; and now she faces these measures. She 
exclaimed: I see no way out of this situation! I see no 
solution! I do not think the measures will solve my problem! I 
think that, inspired by the young woman's example, we should 
answer those who think like this, who believe the measures 
affect them without necessarily presenting a solution to their 
problem. 
  [Sexto] I think the situation is similar to that of a 
critically ill patient who asks his doctor: Doctor, if you are 
trying to save me, why are you making me go hungry? In this 
hypothetical case, I imagine the doctor would answer: Precisely 
to save your life. In other words, I believe the measures to 
restore the internal financial situation became effective on 1 
June as part of a series of measures that I imagine will also be 
implemented in the near future within our economy. They are 
intended precisely to save the citizen's life, figuratively 
speaking. 
  I believe that in almost all cases, saving a life involves a 
heroic action, or a painful action, or a daring action. I do not 
believe a life can be saved with a smile on your face or a sweep 
of the hand. Like I said, the action per se implies heroism, 
daring, and pain. Continuing the metaphor, we might add that 
these measures strive to save our economy from excessive 
liquidity, which as everyone knows, hampers productivity and 
discourages work. It even boosts prices in the so-called 
underground economy. We will talk about that later. 
  [Rodriguez] I think this is important to discuss because the 
young woman I mentioned complained precisely about this. She 
said: The measure only worsens things. On the one hand, the 
state charges more; and, on the other hand, the speculators 
raised their prices as soon as the measures were announced. 
While she was debating this with me, I realized that her 
desperation did not let her understand everything I tried to 
explain. That is why I believe this analysis -- this is a 
message to our listeners today -- must be made calmly, without 
anger, without thinking about negative things. 
  Think positively, as the saying goes. You must think 
positively because the financial measures may be something new 
for us, but they have been enforced all over the world. The 
problem is that other types of financial measures have also been 
enforced throughout the world. They provoke large-scale 
unemployment and privatizations -- that is the new liberal trend 
-- but they always yield results when it comes to truly reducing 
the balance of internal finances. 
  [Sexto] We have said this on previous occasions. Given the 
current situation in Cuba, there is no option but to implement 
this type of measures. They may resemble measures that were 
implemented, or are being implemented, in other countries. We 
said a few weeks ago that the measures strive to reduce 
citizens' purchasing power. In other words, when there is an 
excessive amount of money circulating because of scant 
mercantile availability, the citizens, the workers accumulate 
large sums of money. It is a salary that practically cannot be 
spent in the official market, and is therefore accumulated -- or 
else circulates in the so-called underground economy. It is the 
same thing. In other words, the worker can give his money to the 
speculator, to the black market vendor, but the money never 
reaches the bank; the money never again reaches the state 
vaults. It remains in circulation and negatively affects the 
economy. Osvaldo, please allow me to continue for a moment. I 
think this must be considered unavoidable. We cannot believe 
there is any alternative under these circumstances. We must 
understand this. I think that when we realize these are bitter 
dregs that must be drunk to attain curative, therapeutic results 
from the economic viewpoint, then we will begin to understand 
the measures. 
  Suppose the Cuban Revolution does not implement these 
measures; suppose another regime comes to rule the country 
tomorrow; suppose it is another person with other ideas, another 
social organization, another economic organization, they would 
solve the situation the same way. I want our listeners to 
realize this. There would be no other alternative but to 
implement these measures. There would be a difference, however 
between what the Cuban Revolution, what the revolutionary 
government does today and what -- hypothetically speaking -- 
another government, another social regime would do. Evidently, 
it has been said that these measures... [pauses] I have read 
some foreign news agencies' reports. They state: Cubans claim 
these are not shock measures but, if the price of cigarettes is 
raised almost 700 percent, or 500 percent, is this not a shock 
measure? Well, it depends on how you look at it. If the 
cigarettes' usual price is raised 500 percent or 600 percent, 
but the public health budget remains unchanged, and the 
education budget remains unchanged, then the measures are not 
exactly shock measures. 
  [Rodriguez] Nevertheless, it depends on who evaluates 
them. Some have called them moderate measures. They have not 
necessarily called them harsh measures. 
  [Sexto] They are the most intelligent ones. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes, they are obviously the most intelligent 
ones. Nevertheless, we are here, being affected by the measures, 
and we consider them neither exaggerated nor weak measures. The 
measures are negative; the measures undeniably affect us today; 
but they will improve our situation. Furthermore, they represent 
our only option. The only other possible option would be to have 
enough products to fill the market. We all know that given the 
current circumstances in our economy, we have no money to import 
the necessary products or the raw materials to manufacture them 
in the country. 
  In due time -- technicians and experts say in not less than 
18 months -- we will realize the essential results of these 
measures. The peso -- the value of which has decreased, which is 
devalued, and which people practically do not even consider 
nowadays -- will be much more valuable. The peso will assume 
more value, proportionate to the degree to which I must use 
pesos from my salary to pay for services and products. We will 
see the peso recover its value to the extent that money 
circulating in the country achieves a rational, stable value, a 
value recommended by experts, a figure suggested by common 
sense, so far as financial sense is concerned. 
  In fact, to reassure certain people... [pauses] you know 
that 
many people worry about the black market and the underground 
economy. Many think that the black market and the underground 
economy solve the people's problems. I wish to dispute what 
those people say. I say the black market does not provide for 
the country because I am quite convinced that the amount of 
merchandise circulating in the black market is a minimal amount; 
it is a minimal volume of merchandise. 
  Aside from that, no family can afford black market prices. 
You must clearly realize that. No one can live on the black 
market. The problem is that the black market also creates an 
illusion, the same illusion created by the peasant's free 
market, the illusion of a store window full of things that I can 
buy. The truth is that you buy two pounds of rice today, two 
pounds of beans another day, a chicken on another day, and a 
piece of pork on yet another, but when you add up two pounds of 
rice, two pounds of beans, a chicken, plus a piece of pork, it 
represents much more than the income of a family in which four 
persons work. 
  [Sexto] Of course. But there is more, Osvaldo. There is 
more. 
It is an illusion. The amount of merchandise in the underground 
economy is a mixture of black market mechandise and merchandise 
that, in one way or another, comes from legal sources. The 
minimum volume of the underground economy is indicated precisely 
by the high prices of that economy. The blind, deaf laws of a 
market economy prevail in the undergound economy, the so-called 
black market. If I have a small amount, the prices go up. If 
there was a lot of merchandise in that market.... 
  [Rodriguez, interrupting] The prices would drop. 
  [Sexto] The prices would not be so enormous, so brutal. 
  [Rodriguez] We will now have to see how the cigarette prices 
react, for example, where there is a sufficient supply [words 
indistinct]. 
  [Sexto] Of course, of course. 
  [Rodriguez] If there is a need to sell cigarettes in the 
undergound economy... [pauses] I think some people buy their 
quota even though they do not smoke. They will buy it at 6 or 7 
pesos; and, if they want to sell it to get additional income, 
they will have to sell it for less than the open market price, 
which is 9 pesos. In other words, they cannot sell it for a much 
higher price because there is a volume of cigarettes on the open 
market and the black market therefore has no reason to exist. 
The underground economy has absolutely no reason to exist. 
  [Sexto] You said the black market prices are high because 
there is a small amount of merchandise. 
  [Rodriguez] That is right. Also, to the degree that excess 
circulating money and excess money in the Cuban people's hands 
decreases as a result of all these measures... [pauses] for the 
sake of calming some people who worry about this -- personally 
speaking, I have had altercations with certain people -- I state 
that the black market will tend to decrease because it must be 
proportionate to the volume of circulating money and the 
people's purchasing ability. 
  [Sexto] Of course. To the degree that there is less money, 
there will be less opportunity to demand a high price. 
Therefore, Osvaldo, to conclude -- I think you are reminding me 
that we are running out of time -- I believe this must be 
considered a sick person's unavoidable step toward recovery. He 
must undergo a treatment that many times proves uncomfortable or 
painful. 
  I also issue an appeal to the people's patriotic spirit. The 
citizens cannot think only with the lower levels of their 
conscience. They must also think with the superior levels. We 
have a debt toward the Cuban Revolution. We might talk about 
that in another program. I believe that we must protect the 
Cuban Revolution's achievements by making a contribution today 
-- this sacrifice.

<F P=106> [By Alonso de Contreras] </F>
  [Text] Santo Domingo, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The arrival of U.S. 
military officers to the Dominican Republic to provide 
assistance on the Haitian blockade and the alleged risk that the 
crisis could be extended to the entire island has diluted the 
interest over the result of the controversial elections held on 
16 May, which is still pending. 
  Twelve U.S. military officers and civilians, all assigned to 
the U.S. Army Atlantic Command [as received], arrived in the 
Dominican Republic last night in response to a request made by 
Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer for support in carrying out 
the embargo on Haiti. 
  The arrival of the military officers, however, has been 
criticized in numerous Dominican political and media circles. 
It was described as an intervention and an attempt against 
Dominican sovereignty. In addition, the principal Dominican 
business and social leaders have written a letter to the UN 
Security Council, the UN secretary general, the OAS secretary 
general, the U.S. Congress, and the EU, in which they warn of 
the danger that "poor handling" of the Haitian crisis could 
destabilize both countries, which share the island of Hispaniola. 
  The signatories of the document, ranging from members of the 
Catholic hierarchy to presidents of media and business 
organizations, who did not send a copy of their letter to the 
Dominican Government, ask themselves if the Haitian crisis "as 
it is being handled now could destabilize the entire island of 
Hispaniola, turning it into a volcano of 14 million people." 
  The letter, after noting the huge cultural differences 
between Dominicans and Haitians, states that the 1991 military 
coup in Port-au-Prince "and the subsequent embargo have 
aggravated a chronic crisis, which because of poor handling 
(...) threatens to break up the coexistence between the two 
peoples." 
  The authors of the communique, after insisting that "a 
deformed image of the links and relations between Dominicans and 
Haitians has been presented," note that the Dominican Republic 
in the last 25 years has been able to develop "a democratic 
system that has allowed the holding (...) of free elections." 
  The document, which was distributed today to get the 
signatures of Dominican citizens, says "the Haitian population 
pressure, with its outgrowth of illiteracy, disease, ecological 
devastation, and large scarcities, demands that the Haitian 
problem be resolved with the assistance of the economically 
powerful countries." The document, however, does not specify 
the type of assistance required. 
  The Haitians "displace Dominicans from their jobs, reduce 
wages, compete for land, and cause serious health problems," it 
adds in obvious reference to the thousands of black laborers who 
participate every year in the harvesting of sugarcane and who 
receive wages lower than those given to Dominicans and even live 
in "bateyes" (communities) established by government firms. 
  After repeating that the Haitian "tragedy" is worsening with 
the UN and OAS embargo, the letter asserts that "no country, 
with conditions similar to those in the Dominican Republic, is 
willing to shelter the Haitians who flee from the intolerable 
conditions in which they live. The massive Haitian immigration 
has implications, not only of a social and economic character, 
but also prompts a political situation of unforeseeable 
consequences in the future of the Dominican Republic." 
  All observers consider the letter to be the most important 
document presented by the Dominican Republic on the Haitian 
issue. Diplomatically, the government has not defended this 
position at the United Nations and has only done so timidly at 
the OAS. The document ends with a defense of Haiti's and 
Dominican Republic's sovereignty. 
  The letter, dated 8 June, was made public today, 24 days 
after the Dominican Republic general elections concluded. The 
final election results are still unknown -- although President 
Balaguer leads his opponents in the provisional vote recount. 
The post-electoral crisis is still visible due to the 
opposition's charges of fraud. The letter also appears after 
President Balaguer ordered a "blockade" of the border following 
a meeting with U.S., UN, and OAS representatives on 25 May to 
discuss compliance with the embargo on Haiti. According to 
Washington and the international organizations, Santo Domingo 
was not complying with the embargo.

  [Text] Claudette Werleigh, the Aristide government's 
foreign minister, considers the latest OAS General Assembly 
measure a very firm message to the de facto authorities in 
Haiti. The 34 OAS foreign ministers adopted a resolution on an 
embargo on commercial flights to and from Haiti and on freezing 
the financial assets of members of the Haitian provisional 
government: 
  [Begin Werleigh recording, in Creole] This is why they 
mention in the resolution....[pauses] One of the last points 
involves working toward professionalizing the Army so that we 
can have an Army that protects the territory and helps us form 
the new police force provided for in our Constitution rather 
than one that tortures people, kills, and destroys. [end

  [Excerpts] The People's National Assembly [APN] has issued 
a press release that notes we are passing through a difficult 
moment in the history of the battle of the people's masses, a 
period involving all the reactionary forces, including macoutes 
appointed by the bourgeoisie and U.S. imperialism to break up 
the people's struggle to change their living conditions. The 
APN says the Army and the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion 
and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH] have been leading a (?knocking) 
operation against members of people's organizations nationwide 
since the end of April. 
  The APN reports that this (?knocking) operation continues in 
Borgne. On 2 June, the unscrupulous Army and the wild animals 
[lame sanmanman an avek tout kolonn bet sovaj] who are part of 
FRAPH burned peasants' houses and gardens. They plundered and 
stole oxen and food and staged a slaughter that prompted 
peasants to flee the area. [passage omitted] 
  The APN adds that this (?knocking) operation is leading up 
to 
a military intervention, which will allow the U.S. imperialists 
to occupy the country for a certain time, the only way to come 
and protect the macoutes from the people who are asking for 
justice. 
  The APN warns the people against the [word indistinct] 
policy 
that the bourgeoisie and the little avalanche bourgeoisie have 
been carrying out for three years, a policy that has kept the 
people waiting. It is a way to demobilize them and make them 
believe that U.S. military forces will come to save (?them) from 
the terror of the macoutes. The APN says this in light of the 
U.S. military intervention hanging over Charlemagne Peralte's 
country. 
  The APN asks President Aristide to stop (?changing his 
words) 
and to be courageous enough to take a clear stand on the 
intervention issue if he does not want history to regard him as 
a Haitian trading Charlemagne for Uncle Sam. The APN says 
President Aristide should take a clear stand on the intervention 
issue. The APN again says that it opposes any foreign military 
intervention into the country of Dessalines and Charlemagne. 
The APN concludes: Down with military intervention! Down with 
reconciliation with macoutes! Up with the struggle resting on 
the arms' strength of the people!

  [Text] The Capois-La-Mort Organization has accused the 
president-in-exile of the crime of high treason and of 
complicity with the enemy. The organization calls on the Senate 
of the Republic to rigorously apply the Constitution to its 
maximum against Jean-Bertrand Aristide, accusing him of having 
asked, on several occasions, for the occupation of his own 
country by a foreign Army. 
  The Capois-La-Mort Organization demands the government set 
in 
motion public action against the president-in-exile, guilty, 
according to the organization, of high treason and complicity 
with the enemy. 
  The National Christian Democratic Party, PDCH, reasserts its 
opposition to the physical return of President Aristide to Haiti 
and expresses indignation about the latest statements by the 
priest/president. PDCH calls those statements murderous. PDCH of 
the late Sylvio Claude, led by Joachin Pierre, asks the 
concerned institutions, especially the Haitian parliament, to 
assume their responsibilities lest the institutions be 
questioned in the court of history.

  [Text] Citing sources close to the Clinton administration, 
one of President Aristide's advisers-in-exile has said the 
United States is preparing to suspend its commercial flights and 
to broadcast radio programs into Haiti. Michael Barnes, 
principal adviser to the president-in-exile, said the U.S. 
Government is ready to unilaterally tighten UN sanctions ordered 
against the military that overthrew elected President Aristide 
31 months ago by withdrawing U.S. visas granted to some wealthy 
Haitian families who support the putschists. The radio 
broadcasts would allow Father Aristide to speak to the Haitian 
people on his request, he stated. Haitian soldiers are led to 
believe that if Aristide returns, they will be murdered or 
arrested. The president wants to let them know of his plans to 
rebuild the country and to professionalize the Army by 
separating it from the police, the president-in-exile's adviser 
explained. 
  The creation of a civilian police force and the 
professionalization of the Army can take a lot of time -- 
perhaps until February 1996, the date the elected president's 
mandate expires, the adviser acknowledged. Barnes denied that 
President Aristide, who only governed for seven months in Haiti, 
intends to extend his mandate of 31 months. He will respect the 
Constitution, which prohibits any reelection to the Presidency, 
and will transfer power to his elected successor in 1995, Barnes 
noted. The president-in-exile's adviser also indicated that 
upon his return, Aristide intends to create jobs by reinforcing 
Haiti's infrastructures and by addressing the most urgent needs 
with a $500 million plan.

  [Excerpt] The National Front for Change and Democracy 
[FNCD] advises that it has created a democratic space, bringing 
together many sectors that are struggling for democracy in the 
country. It is called the 16 December Democratic Camp, or K-16 
[Kan Demokratik 16 Desanm]. The FNCD congratulates all 
organizations that have united to defend the principles of the 
16 December 1990 and 20 January 1991 elections. The FNCD says it 
has taken this opportunity to tell the population that the 
solidarity ... [pauses] the political unity called K-16 has not 
preempted the autonomy of the organizations that have joined 
this movement. 
  According to a press release issued by the FNCD on 9 June, 
K-16 is an assemblage of all organizations that deem it 
necessary to unite the people in order to reach an acceptable 
solution to the serious crisis the country has been experiencing 
since the 30 September 1991 coup. FNCD says it encourages all 
people's and peasant organizations, unions, students, pupils, 
women, socioprofessionals, and staunch political parties 
throughout the nine geographic departments of the country to 
cooperate with K-16 in order to activate, and together support, 
peaceful political activities so the crisis can be resolved and 
so Aristide can return to the country soon, in order to put an 
end to the de facto practice. 
  The FNCD explains to everyone that peaceful political 
activities include nonviolent actions, steps that do not 
threaten lives and private or public property. Once again, the 
FNCD asks General Cedras and his colleagues to resign to release 
the country from its suffering and the danger of an invasion by 
foreign forces. 
  Friends, day has dawned. Get up! The cock has crowed. This 
must change, the FNCD concludes in a press release signed by Dr. 
Turneb Delpe and Evans Paul. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Jose Mauricio Rodriguez, the human rights 
coordinator for the Prosecutor General's Office, yesterday 
announced that the court-martial that will handle the case of 
Ismael Lopez, a U.S. soldier accused of murdering a Salvadoran 
citizen, will take place in Panama City from 27 June to 1 July. 
  He said the Prosecutor General's Office will send a 
representative to Panama (U.S. Southern Command Headquarters) to 
observe the process, following an invitation from the U.S. 
Government. Major Lopez, a member of the military detachment 
assigned to the U.S. Embassy in this country, has been accused 
of murdering his 54-year-old bodyguard, Crescencio Diaz. 
[passage omitted] 
  The trial will begin within the next few days, and a 
Prosecutor General's Office delegate will attend it to observe 
the process, which will be handled by U.S. military officers. 
  According to the human rights coordinator, the 
investigations 
conducted by Salvadoran judicial authorities will be taken into 
account, but these authorities will not get directly involved in 
the court-martial. The prosecutor, who is a military officer, 
and the defense attorney will cite the findings of the 
Salvadoran investigations. 
  The Prosecutor General's Office also announced that Maj. 
Lopez will be tried on charges of murder and eight other felony 
counts. Fifteen days after the trial ends, the final verdict 
will be known; that is, we will find out whether he was 
acquitted or convicted. 
  At the time of the incident, Lopez was working as a military 
adviser to the Salvadoran Armed Forces and had diplomatic 
immunity.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] It was reported this afternoon that a clandestine 
group -- the self-proclaimed Domingo Monterrosa Command -- has 
issued a death threat against Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos 
Mauricio Molina. Molina, however, denied that he himself 
received the death threat, but he did not rule out the 
possibility that such a threat had indeed been made. According 
to news agencies reports, Molina was given 48 hours to leave the 
country, or he will be executed. 
  [Begin Molina recording] I cannot rule out the possibility 
that the threat, which was uttered by people who oppose peace 
and the country's stability, might be serious. [end recording] 
  Molina added that despite the threat he is willing to remain 
in his post, because he has made a pledge to the people and 
intends to fulfill it. He also said he will open an 
investigation to identify the individuals behind the threats -- 
individuals he said should be considered enemies of peace. 
  [Begin Molina recording] The threats against several Jesuits 
do not contribute to the peace process whatsoever. Instead, 
each voice that calls for violence undermines the present trend 
toward peace. [end recording] 
  A communique signed by the Domingo Monterrosa Command and 
reported by various news agencies also contains death threats 
against the attorney general, the president of the Judiciary 
Council, Jesuit priests, and Luis Gomez Zarate for his criticism 
of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central Bank of 
Honduras [BCH] today announced strong control measures on the 
U.S. dollar exchange system so as to stabilize the value of the 
lempira, which has dropped by 13.5 percent in relation to the 
official exchange rate of 7.27 lempiras per dollar in the past 
few weeks. 
  BCH President Hugo Noe Pino said that the pressure on the 
local currency and the economy is caused by "speculation" by 
private exchange brokers, and that these brokers "are a source 
of exchange instability." 
  The BCH keeps the official exchange rate at 7.27 lempiras 
per 
dollar as a means of taxing imports, but the dollar is sold at 
the rate of 8.41 lempiras on the black market, making it 
impossible "to estimate a balanced average," Pino said. 
  He said "strong" measures will be taken to control the 
foreign currency market. He declined to mention the regulations 
that will be added to other monetary decisions. 
  The government implemented control in late May on 50 percent 
of the U.S. dollars the exchange system accumulated. The 
government forces exchange brokers to sell 40 percent of their 
dollars to the BCH, according to experts, so as to bolster 
international reserves and to be prepared to face foreign debt 
amortizations. 
  Pino said the BCH will announce next week the new monetary 
measures that will effect stability and an inflow of Honduran 
exporters' dollars presently deposited in foreign banks. 
  Authorities estimate approximately $1.5 billion belong to 
Hondurans who are waiting for monetary stability before 
transferring the money to Honduras are deposited in U.S. banks. 
  The assembly plant industry, which brings between $70 
million 
and $100 million annually from exports, will have to report its 
dollars to the BCH, Pino said. 
  Honduran dollars are transacted through the formal banking 
system, the exchange brokers, who buy and sell dollars 
exclusively, and the black market, which the central banking 
system does not regulate.

<F P=106> [Report by Daniel Naszewski] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- The trade deficit 
registered in the first four months of 1994 has really surprised 
analysts. They knew it would be high. Domingo Cavallo 
anticipated that this year's deficit would be bigger than the 
1993 deficit, but when the figure -- $2.405 billion -- was 
announced it caused concern because it shows the deficit for the 
year will not just be "somewhat bigger" than last year; it will 
much bigger than last year. The trade deficit for the whole of 
last year totaled $3.7 billion, which is only a little more than 
the deficit for the first four months of this year. 
  The most "optimistic" projection based on this figure is a 
year-end deficit of around $5 billion -- the Economy Ministry 
calculated it at $4.7 billion -- while "pessimistic projections" 
estimate it at $8 billion, or even $10 billion if the current 
feverish import drive continues while exports increase at a much 
slower pace. 
  Very few people think the figures will reach those levels 
because the Economy Ministry will probably do something to slow 
the process. Cavallo's team is actively preparing a way to 
achieve the effects of a currency devaluation without a 
devaluation, or to improve the real foreign exchange situation 
without changing the nominal exchange rate in an attempt to 
rapidly enhance exports. 
  It is clear that the most reasonable path, within the series 
of alternatives that the Economy Ministry is studying, is to 
increase our exports, not to try to reduce imports. The 
economic opening is conceptually based on the principle of 
encouraging imports as well as exports in order to insert the 
economy in the competitive international world market where each 
country tries to produce only those consumer goods it can 
produce in the most competitive way and import the rest from 
other countries. The classic idea of specialization continues 
to be amazingly logical, particularly now that transport and 
communications are cheaper and more efficient. 
  Thus, it seems improbable that the Economy Ministry will do 
much to slow the import drive unless it becomes absolutely 
necessary to prevent problems worsening in the productive 
structure or to slow down a potentially explosive trade deficit. 
  We can see that an increasingly large slice of our imports 
are in capital goods, which clearly shows that the country is 
allotting more and more resources to improving production and 
growth. The latest figures on the import of capital goods are 
those of the first quarter. They confirm that more than 30 
percent of our imports consist of equipment, machinery, and 
other capital goods used to reequip productive activities in 
agriculture, industry, and services -- principally 
communications. 
  This is consistent with data on internal savings and 
investments, which is around 18 or 19 percent of the GDP, 
compared to 14 percent at the end of the 1980's when 
hyperinflation and stagnation pushed investment levels to its 
lowest level in decades. 
  The trend confirms that Cavallo is not thinking of severely 
restricting imports, unless the situation becomes intolerable. 
He needs imports to sustain the economy's future growth. Thus, 
the most logical path is to continue creating ways to increase 
exports. Some mechanisms are already in place, besides tax 
returns, among them reimbursements for exporting manufactured 
products. The result is clear: During 1993, industries exported 
28 percent more than in 1992. 
  The economic team is currently working on ways to reimburse 
producers of agriculture products. We will have news in this 
area shortly. In the proposal, products with higher added value 
will benefit the most. The logic is simple. We must export 
products that use relatively cheap and abundant national raw 
materials with the highest possible level of industrialization. 
One objective is to industrialize agriculture activities, a 
goal that was many times proposed but never adequately 
instrumented, partly due to prejudices over the "irrelevant" 
idea of exporting food in a world where "the fashion" is to 
export sophisticated manufactured goods. If Cavallo can 
encourage agriculture industrialization the same way he has done 
with industries, we will be able to say that the two-way 
opening, the only possible path, has begun to work.

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada today announced that Marcelo Cespedes 
Gutierrez has been appointed the new labor minister. Gutierrez 
replaces Reynaldo Peters, who resigned today. 
  Peters' sudden resignation can be added to those of Luis 
Lema, Bolivian ambassador to Argentina; and Jorge Otasevich, the 
congressional and political affairs under secretary, both of 
whom resigned today. 
  Ernesto Machicao, minister of social communications, 
explained that the resigning government officials will replace 
those senators who have been objected to in the ongoing 
impeachment process against the suspended president and senior 
justice of the Supreme Court. 
  The impeachment process against Supreme Court President 
Edgar 
Oblitas and Senior Justice Ernesto Poppe is in its final stages 
after an anguishing process in the Chamber of Deputies and the 
Senate. This is the first effort made to establish a precedent 
in the battle against corruption undertaken by the Sanchez de 
Lozada administration. 
  The defense objected to several of the senators from the 
ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR). In view of 
this there was a risk that the two-thirds of the votes necessary 
to approve the impeachment would not be achieved. 
  With the votes of Peters, Lema, and Otasevich, the MNR will 
be able to secure the majority of votes necessary to approve the 
impeachment process.

  [Excerpt] The Bolivian Catholic Church, which has 
maintained a "protest silence" over amendments to the education 
system, spoke out during the Corpus Christi celebrations 
yesterday. In a homily against the government, it demanded that 
society be allowed to participate in the drafting and 
application of laws to change the country. 
  In a homily to celebrate Corpus Christi, La Paz Archbishop 
Luis Sainz Hinojosa said: "A better distribution of wealth, a 
real opening to allow the participation of society, and the 
drafting of a modern education system requires the participation 
of all Bolivians." 
  President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada and Vice President 
Victor 
Hugo Cardenas, who attended mass accompanied by their wives and 
ministers of state, listened carefully to the Archbishop's 
homily. 
  From the pulpit, Sainz Hinojosa faced the highest Bolivian 
authorities. He did not miss the opportunity to ask the 
government to focus its attention on "improving salaries and job 
opportunities, and thus improving the living standards of the 
Bolivian people." 
  He reiterated the demands of the Bolivian Episcopal 
Conference Education Commission, whose main representative 
protested because the National Education Council (Coned) drafted 
alterations to the Education Reform Framework law. 
  Referring to the amendment -- which was made without any 
consultation -- to the framework law that was submitted to 
Congress for approval, Sainz stated: "The Education Reform, 
which will change the education of our people, is a national 
priority and a social responsibility that needs the unselfish 
participation of all." 
  The points about making municipalities responsible for the 
education service, eliminating teachers schools, and the 
drafting of an ideological and political framework for the 
education system are the most controversial points confronting 
the government and the involved sectors that are against them. 
  Aware of the problems affecting Bolivian society, the La Paz 
archbishop urged Bolivians to reconcile their viewpoint in favor 
of the unity of the country, which is affected by a serious 
economic crisis. 
  As he stared at the government officials praying before the 
alter, Sainz said: "The Body of Christ invites us to be united, 
to cooperate, to wholeheartedly serve our people who must be 
rescued from so much slavery, so many sins, and so much 
corruption." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero has asked his economic team to draft alternative 
measures to prevent a sharp increase in interest rates during 
the first months of the economic program. Ricupero is very 
aware of President Itamar Franco's concern about this issue. 
Franco has questioned high interest rates and wants to stave 
off a possible conflict with Planalto Palace over the 
establishment of interest rates in real terms (above the 
inflation rate). The launching of the real is only some 20 days 
away and the finance minister and his team are still trying to 
explain to President Franco that the success of the Real Plan 
will be in jeopardy unless the government implements a tight 
monetary policy (restraint on money supply). A member of the 
economic team conceded that "the question of interest rates has 
long been on the mind of the president and the finance minister." 
  According to government advisers, the president has on 
several occasions voiced concern about this issue to Minister 
Ricupero. A member of the economic team noted: "It did not 
reach the point where the president requested the team's 
resignation." Experts believe Franco's concern is normal and 
insist that "Ricupero does not champion high interest rates 
either." They recall, however, that this is a delicate 
question, since it led to the resignation of former Central Bank 
President Paulo Cesar Ximenes, a staunch advocate of high 
interest rates. 
  The members of the economic team believe, from a technical 
standpoint, it is not advisable to implement low interest rates 
during the first months of the Real Plan. They are seeking 
alternatives also to counter a possible signal that the 
government is betting on an economic downturn in the country 
until the end of the year. Ricupero has been pressured from all 
sides to desist from implementing a sharp increase in interest 
rates as of 1 July. During his weekly meeting with businessmen, 
they asked the government not to establish high interest rates 
because it would only contribute to a renewed recession. 
Ricupero's response has been the same for weeks: "The plan will 
not foster a recession." 
  Ricupero has discussed with Franco and entrepreneurs a 
concern raised by economists. According to the minister, high 
interest rates are necessary to prevent speculation on the 
financial market rather than to check consumption. "Those in 
favor of high interest rates are afraid of a movement of 
financial assets," he stated. His aides believe $6 billion, 
which has been invested in the financial market, may easily be 
funneled into other investments such as gold, the dollar, and 
real estate, thus jeopardizing the success of the economic plan.

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- The Chamber of Deputies 
tonight approved, through an agreement among party leaders, the 
new law punishing economic power abuse, the so-called antitrust 
law. After lengthy negotiations among party leaders, in which 
the government also participated, congressmen voted on the bill 
that had been waiting to be voted since April 1993. The bill 
now passes to the Senate. Senate President Humberto Lucena 
(PMDB-PE) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Pernambuco] said 
that voting will take place next week. President Itamar Franco 
threatened to promulgate a provisional measure with the new 
legislation if Senate does not approve the bill by the end of 
this week. 
  Chamber of Deputies President Inocencio de Oliveira 
(PMDB-PE) 
did his best to ensure an accord among the parties to make 
voting feasible. The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], however, 
opposed the bill and requested a postponement of the voting. 
Oliveira and PPR leader Marcelino Romano (SP) [Sao Paulo] 
quarreled during the plenary session when Oliveira prevented 
Romano from using the microphone. Oliveira then excused himself 
because he needed the presence of PPR deputies to be able to 
begin voting. 
  Romano pointed out an unconstitutional aspect of the bill, 
because it transforms the Administrative Council for Economic 
Defense (CADE) into a self-supported government organization in 
the same text as it defines a series of economic power abuse 
cases and punishment of people and companies that perpetrate 
them. In spite of this the bill was approved without 
modifications. The seven members of the CADE, including its 
president, will be appointed by the president of the Republic 
and, after their names are approved by the Senate, will have a 
two-year mandate. 
  The accord reached today between the government and the 
party 
leaders reduced the maximum fine to be applied to companies 
guilty of economic power abuse. Instead of paying of between 10 
and 50 percent fees of their gross profits, as contemplated in 
the original text, the fine was reduced to between 1 and 30 
percent, at the request of congressmen. The index for 
participation in the market, which defines market monopoly, was 
increased from 20 percent to 30 percent. The CADE can prevent 
the merging of companies that result in creation of oligopolies 
in the market. The CADE has 30 days to announce its decision in 
each case. The text states that preventive arrest of 
entrepreneurs responsible for economic power abuse can be 
requested as long as there evidence against them. This 
sanction, however, will only be applied to crimes against the 
economy order and no longer against the people's pockets, as 
previously contemplated. 
  Companies, including the state-owned ones, that do not 
respond to requests for data within a period of 15 days may be 
fined up to 10,000 Reference Fiscal Units (Ufir). The bill 
gives CADE more power to define what is an abusive price 
increase. This will allow the council to file several lawsuits 
that currently could not be filed.

<F P=106> [Report by Luiz Augusto Mendonca from Planalto Palace] </F>
  [Text] President Itamar Franco may sign tonight the 
antitrust law, which was passed this afternoon by the Senate. 
  Shortly after the approval of the law, Senate President 
Humberto Lucena and Deputy Fabio Feldmann -- who was the 
rapporteur of the bill in the Chamber of Deputies -- came to 
Planalto Palace to meet with President Itamar Franco and with 
the justice and finance ministers. The meeting has not yet 
concluded. 
  Because the new law establishes that directors and members 
of 
the board of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense 
(CADE) must be appointed by the president of the Republic and 
confirmed by a majority vote of the national Congress, President 
Franco may issue tonight a provisional measure confirming 
incumbent CADE officials so that they may start implementing the 
new law tomorrow. 
  In case of price abuses, the law provides for fines of up to 
30 percent of the gross annual sales of large enterprises and 
preventive imprisonment for their directors and owners. A large 
enterprise is a group that controls 30 percent of the market.

<F P=106> [Report by "Jn Galazi" and "Carlos Nobre"] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 8 Jun (AE) -- Acting National 
Confederation of Industries (CNI) President Mario Amato said 
today that the antitrust law "is draconian to entrepreneurs," 
who feel insecure and fearful of possible punishment. According 
to Amato, the law will not benefit enterprises, the government, 
or consumers. As an example, he said the president of a 
state-run utility company will not be jailed if the company 
issues an incorrect bill. Private enterprises, however, will be 
subject to this type of penalty. Despite his position against 
the antitrust law, Amato voiced support for the Real Plan 
because it is being implemented gradually. 
  Amato lectured today at a seminar entitled "The Solution Is 
To Create Jobs," sponsored by the Brazilian Service for 
Promotion of Small and Micro Enterprises (Sebrae), in Rio de 
Janeiro, during which he said everyone should try to promote the 
domestic market. In this regard, he proposed an agenda for the 
creation of jobs involving five topics to be discussed by the 
whole society: elimination of restrictions on incoming foreign 
capital, reduction of social contributions, promotion of 
exports, tax reform, and promotion of small and micro 
enterprises, which are the main source of jobs on the Brazilian 
market. 
  Sole Workers Center (CUT) President Vicente Paulo da Silva, 
aka Vicentinho, endorsed Amato's words, adding his own 
suggestions: reduction of the work week to 40 hours, land 
reform, and incentives for the creation of small enterprises. 
Former Mines and Energy Minister Pratini de Moraes demanded the 
elimination of taxes on exports, noting that this can help 
create 300,000 jobs. Among such taxes, he mentioned the IPMF 
[Provisional Tax on Financial Operations], Confins [Social 
Security contributions], ICM [Goods Movement Tax], and IPI [Tax 
on Manufactured Products]. With tax exemptions, Brazilian 
exports will grow by $6 billion, he said, thus increasing the 
positive balance of trade, which last year registered exports 
worth $38 billion and imports worth $23 billion. 
  Taxes paid by export industry entrepreneurs amount to $8 
billion annually, and they feel insecure without a clear policy 
for the industry. Brazil, Burkina Faso, and Bangladesh are the 
only three countries that tax their exports, Moraes said. He 
added that exports account for only 7 percent of Brazilian 
industrial production, and Brazilian commerce accounts for only 
0.65 percent of world trade.

<F P=106> [Report by Tania Monteiro] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief 
of the Armed Forces General Staff (EMFA), today branded "greedy" 
the bankers and entrepreneurs who are speculating on prices. 
Like President Itamar Franco and Navy Minister Admiral Ivan 
Serpa, Leite advocated punishment for the "greedy" who are 
attempting to harm the economic plan. Minister Serpa believes it 
is also necessary to restructure the administration of justice 
in Brazil in order to make it more expedient. 
  The two ministers made their statements today after a 
ceremony at the Navy Ministry marking the 500th anniversary of 
the Treaty of Todersilhas' signing. Franco promised to issue a 
provisional measure punishing oligopolies if Congress has not 
approved a bill by 8 June punishing cartels, sponsored by PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party] Sao Paulo Deputy Fabio 
Feldmann. 
  "In a democracy, it is not enough to just be willing to 
punish. There must be laws, and in the case of Brazil, the laws 
must be quickly enforced after a crime has been committed," 
Serpa said. He wondered: "Is it right to delay trying someone 
who has committed a crime until the statute of limitation makes 
the law unenforceable?" Asked about the type of crime he was 
referring to, Serpa replied: "I am referring to all crimes 
because to me thieves, even if they steal a chicken, are all the 
same, despite the fact that here in Brazil there are some 
differences in this regard." 
  Minister Serpa added that he is concerned about oligopolies 
in Brazil. He said entrepreneurs must be careful because if they 
increase their prices they may be mortgaging their own future, 
because with high prices the number of clients drops 
dramatically. He believes that "profits, as such, are not a 
crime but a sin." "Profits become a crime when entrepreneurs 
violate the law," the minister noted, adding that those who 
break the law must go to jail. "Criminals should go to jail," he 
stated, adding that "unfortunately, few people go to jail in 
Brazil." 
  About the military salary problem, Leite said military 
salaries did not deteriorate after implementation of the URV 
[Real Value Unit], but food prices are undergoing "tremendous" 
growth. Leite blamed the exaggerated price increases on 
entrepreneurs' greed.

<F P=106> [By Marta Salomon] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 8 Jun (AE) -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso, 
presidential candidate of the PSDB-PFL-PTB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party] 
coalition, today contended that he has a copyright for the 
economic plan, and that he does not intend to separate his 
presidential campaign from the new currency, the real. Upon 
being informed that he will be served notice by the Superior 
Electoral Court (TSE) about his using the economic plan in his 
electoral campaign, Cardoso angrily said: "They have no right 
to take that away from me." TSE Judge Flaqquer Scartezzini sent 
the notice to Cardoso's apartment. Cardoso will have to answer 
the charge in five days. 
  Before even reading the notice, Cardoso said: "They are 
exaggerating." Showing disbelief about the TSE proceeding on 
the basis of a charge made by Deputy Carlos Lupi (Democratic 
Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro), he said: "The court is not going 
to do that." Lupi is asking the TSE to declare Cardoso 
ineligible on grounds of abusing his authority and using the 
economic plan for electoral purposes. Lupi contends that 
Cardoso set the timetable for the economic plan to suit his 
electoral interests. 
  Cardoso said: "I feel hurt." He charged that "they should 
instead be chasing the thieves operating in areas where the 
justice system is faltering." He added: "This is hard to 
believe. A Stalinist regime is going to be reinstated here." 
  As of this afternoon the campaign command of the 
PSDB-PFL-PTB 
coalition has not yet received an official notice. This court 
action threatens to undermine Cardoso's main campaign strategy. 
His allies are indeed seeking to strengthen his links with the 
economic plan and with declining inflation rates. "I am the 
father of the idea. They cannot say that Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso has nothing to do with the real," he said. 
  PSDB President Pimenta da Veiga contends that "one cannot 
overlook the biography of the author of the plan." He added: 
"An absurd attempt is being made to separate Cardoso from his 
plan, to which he is closely linked." PFL leader Luiz Eduardo 
Magalhaes (Bahia State), who is a member of the campaign 
political command, said: "Cardoso is the author of the plan, and 
can claim his copyright." 
  In the opinion of Cardoso's allies, the first concrete 
results of the fight against inflation will in early August 
cause the PSDB candidate to leap forward in the opinion polls. 
Cardoso's political command does not concede the charge that 
the date for implementing the new currency was moved up to suit 
Cardoso's electoral interests. Cardoso has not denied, however, 
that he has kept in close touch with the economic team and with 
President Itamar Franco, who openly works for his presidential 
candidacy.

<F P=106> [Report by Chico Otavio] </F>
  [Text] Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, 8 Jun (AE) -- The National 
Agrarian Secretariat of the PT [Workers Party] has stated that 
the land reform policy it intends to implement in Brazil, if it 
wins the elections, will involve 17.5 million hectares. The 
plan is included in the program of PT presidential candidate 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Jose Graziano da Silva, the program 
coordinator, said expropriation will be the main instrument for 
land redistribution. 
  Graziano is accompanying Lula on a three-day visit to 
Espirito Santo. He released a pamphlet to owners of small farms 
outlining some points of the PT-designed "Program for Brazilian 
Agriculture." A new feature mentioned in the pamphlet is the 
possibility for farmers to use land as a way to repay their 
defaulted loans with federal banks. 
  Graziano said one of the program priorities is the 
settlement 
of 800,000 families over a four-year period. The PT intends to 
settle some 250,000 families in a semi-arid zone in the 
northeastern region -- the so-called Drought Polygon. The 
objective is to give an average of four hectares to each family, 
which would provide work for at least two people per family. 
This project will require about 1 million hectares. 
  Under the project another 550,000 landless families from all 
over Brazil will be given between 20 and 30 hectares each, 
depending on the region. The federal government will need 
approximately 16.5 million hectares to implement this plan. 
Graziano said preference will be given to squatters camping 
along highways, squatters occupying indigenous land, and 
squatters in areas under dispute. 
  Expropriation will affect mainly unproductive properties 
above 500 hectares -- an area that is enough to house 20 
families. The use of land to repay the defaulted loans of 
farmers is also considered a land reform instrument.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 June (AE) -- Less than 1 percent 
of the farms throughout the country are larger than 1,000 
hectares, yet they occupy 43.73 percent of Brazilian rural 
territory. Paradoxically, farms of 10 hectares represent 52.83 
percent of the establishments, yet occupy only 2.66 percent of 
rural territory. This concentration of land in the hands of an 
elite of farmers is causing the expulsion of peasants and 
increasing the population in urban areas. Consequently, 21 
percent of the Brazilian population, or 32 million people, are 
destitute. This phenomenon is causing another unsolvable 
problem: conflicts between the landless and farmers. In 1993 
alone there were more than 900 conflicts over the possession of 
land in the Amazon region. This information is contained in 
research conducted by geographer Dora Hess of the Brazilian 
Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), which was published 
in Rio de Janeiro today during National Environment Week. 
  According to Hess, the 32 million destitute result from the 
excessive concentration of income (10 percent of the poor 
receive only 0.8 percent of the income, while 10 percent of the 
rich receive 48 percent); 12 million workers (20 percent of the 
economically active population) barely earn one minimum salary; 
and the purchasing power of the poor and middle class salaries 
has deteriorated. Hess asserts that "for the past 15 years 
Brazil has been living in recession because the employment 
levels have remained unchanged, the consumption power has 
dropped, and investments have been made in highly qualified jobs 
such as industrial automation." 
  In the survey, which will be published in France, Hess 
quotes 
economist Paulo Schilling to refer to the generalized 
impoverishment of workers. In 1960, according to Schilling, a 
family basket cost 26 percent of the minimum salary. In 1992 it 
cost 78 percent of the minimum salary. Early this year, the 
minimum salary did not cover the cost of the family basket. 
Another consequence of this prolonged recession is the 
increasing number of children between the ages of 10 and 13 on 
the job market. Hess states that "almost 14.15 percent of 
children at this age already work, and this percentage increases 
to 58.89 percent in the rural regions." 
  There are 3.8 million Brazilians living in shantytowns in 
nine metropolitan regions, according to another survey conducted 
by IBGE geographer Helena Balaciano. The Recife metropolitan 
region occupies first place with 678,586 (24.6 percent), 
followed by Belem (19.2 percent), Fortaleza (15.6 percent), Rio 
de Janeiro (12 percent), Belo Horizonte (10.9 percent), Sao 
Paulo (7.5 percent), Curitiba (5.9 percent), Porto Alegre (5.3 
percent), and Salvador (4.1 percent). According to Helena 
Balaciano, the suburbs of the large and medium-sized cities 
currently have to deal with the shantytown phenomenon because 
Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are no longer attractive to 
migrants. Another phenomenon is that the largest number of 
people living in shantytowns are concentrated in the suburbs of 
municipal districts rather than in the capitals themselves, such 
as in Betim (15 percent, ouutside Minas Gerais), and Diadema (20 
percent, outside Sao Paulo). Moreover, Curitiba district, with 
6.9 percent of the population living in shantytowns due to the 
expulsion of landless people from the rural region, holds the 
record for all metropolitan region suburbs.

  [Text] Brasilia, 7 Jun (AE) -- Admiral Mario Flores, 
Strategic Affairs Secretariat (SAE) minister-chief, today 
confirmed the existence of the report disseminated by O ESTADO 
DE SAO PAULO on activities by the Landless People's Movement 
(MST). The confirmation was made during a nearly two-hour 
meeting with Senator Eduardo Suplicy (PT-SP) [Workers Party -- 
Sao Paulo], PT deputies and representatives, and MST leaders. 
The admiral showed the report but did not permit anyone present 
to touch it. He read parts of it to confirm his guarantees that 
the content did not have any ideological or electoral biases. 
  The minister stressed that the government has been 
internally 
hurt by the leak of the report. Another top-level government 
official said there has been a decision to find the person who 
leaked the document. According to PT attorney Luiz Eduardo 
Greenhalgh, who also participated in the meeting, Flores 
emphasized that the SAE is not interested in meddling in 
electoral problems because it is a consultation body for the 
president of the Republic. 
  Flores denied that the movement has been given the dimension 
of a guerrilla movement and attributed the section of the 
document claiming there was a paramilitary training camp in 
Ranch Ipojuca, in Pernambuco, to obsolete evidence. He also made 
clear that the references made about the ranch were based on 
"reports" (unconfirmed facts) of something that occurred in the 
past. The minister characterized the press' dissemination of the 
report as "inflationary paranoia." 
  Minister Flores told Landless Movement representatives that 
the SAE had the legal obligation to write reports on social 
movements such as the MST for the president. The document's 
dissemination forced Flores to explain the matter to the 
president the day after the document's first part appeared in 
the press. 
  Gilmar Gerardo Mauro, one of the MST leaders, said that 
during the meeting Flores explained that the document only 
contained an explanation of the organization and its area of 
influence. Gilmar Mauro said at the meeting's end that he was 
convinced the MST "has nothing to do" with what it was 
attributed to them in the document. For him, the dissemination 
of that type of information "only increases tensions in rural 
areas." The MST leader also said he invited Minister Flores to 
visit Cacador University, which, according to him, is a training 
center where all types of courses and currents, including 
pastoral politics, are taught.

  [Excerpts] The weapons and ammunition industry increased 
significantly last year, recovering its $1.5 million loss in 
1992, attaining a net profit of $8.4 million in 1993. Sales, 
especially those of the Brazilian Cartridge Company [Companhia 
Brasileira de Cartuchos] (CBC) jumped from $98.8 million in 1992 
to $143.2 million in 1993, that is, a 44.9 percent increase. 
[passage omitted] 
  The oil and gas industries, which include Petrobras 
[Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] distributors, closed 1993 with 
net sales of $22.6 billion and net profits of $858.9 million. 
Profits obtained in 1993 were 194 percent up on the $292.4 
million profit obtained in 1992.

  [Excerpts] The 170 or so radio stations linked to the 
Catholic Church will, next January, begin joint transmissions of 
part of their programs. 
  They will transmit through the Igreja-Sat distribution 
system 
operated by Brasil-Sat (Brazilian Satellite Telecommunications). 
  The system will use the satellite channel that was utilized 
by Radio Aparecida, from Apareida do Norte (Sao Paulo). 
  The decision to install a Catholic radio broadcasting 
network 
was quietly made in April, during a general assembly of CNBB 
(National Conference of Brazilian Bishops). 
  On 23 April, bishops and advisers of the Igreja-Sat 
Executive 
Group decided to create a foundation to manage the radio system 
[passage omitted] 
  Father Cesar Moreira was designated president of the 
Igreja-Sat system. He also heads Unda (wave, in Latin), a 
church organization linked with electronic media. [passage

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa returned to 
Santiago this afternoon from an important visit to Buenos Aires, 
where he discussed significant economic issues. The following 
is a report from the international airport in Pudahuel by Arturo 
Harlem: 
  [Begin recording] [Harlem] Good afternoon. Chilean Foreign 
Minister Figueroa stated that Chile has not set any deadlines 
for joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. He added, 
however, that Chile is very interested in achieving an agreement 
in this regard. 
  Upon his arrival from Brazil and Argentina, Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa stressed that Chile's entrance to Mercosur will 
have a great impact at the regional level: 
  [Figueroa] As the foreign ministers have already stated, our 
entrance in Mercosur will have a great political and economic 
impact. If the negotiations are successful, it will result in 
important commercial benefits in the short term for all those 
countries encompassed in this agreement. 
  [Harlem] Figueroa also stated that the Chilean proposal had 
been warmly accepted by Mercosur countries. According to this 
proposal, Chile will be a Mercosur partner, and not a full 
member, because Chilean customs tariffs are substantially lower 
than those enforced in Mercosur countries. 
  Commenting on other issues, Foreign Minister Figueroa 
reasserted that the Chilean Government has no plans to discuss 
the landlocked issue with Bolivia. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Chamber of Deputies President Jorge Schaulsohn 
stated that the Army should order an internal investigation to 
determine who is responsible for the institution deliberating on 
comments by Deputy Jaime Naranjo. Naranjo had stated that the 
Army commander in chief [General Augusto Pinochet] should resign. 
  A few days ago Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo stated that 
the 
protests over the Army commander's trip to Europe prove that, 
quote, his crimes have not been forgotten, unquote. Naranjo 
added that Gen. Pinochet must resign. 
  Press reports stated that the Army was annoyed by Naranjo's 
comments, which it regards as seditious. When asked about the 
issue, Army spokesmen said the institution is annoyed by the 
deputy's comments because it believes he used inappropriate 
language against Gen. Pinochet. The Army added that all this 
prompted Army Deputy Commander General Jorge Lucar to call a 
meeting of Army generals to assess Naranjo's comments as well as 
the media coverage of Gen. Pinochet's tour. 
  The Chamber of Deputies president, in turn, said it will not 
tolerate any interference in the legislators' activities and 
announced that he will submit a request to the defense minister 
to clarify the case. 
  [Begin Schaulsohn recording] I believe it is completely 
unacceptable that Armed Forces members deliberate and voice 
their opinion on legislators' performance. If the 
aforementioned meeting really took place and the comments really 
were made, they are openly violating the Constitution that 
establishes that our Armed Forces should not be involved in 
politics and expressly prohibits them from deliberating. The 
Army should order an investigation within the force to determine 
who was responsible for this political deliberation. [end 
recording] 
  The subject also was discussed by the Socialist and National 
Renewal Parties' presidents and by Deputy Naranjo himself. 
  [Begin recording] [Naranjo] I do not think this problem only 
involves Deputy Naranjo because the Chamber of Deputies on 8 
June, with the support of the National Renewal Party [RN], 
deemed it necessary to check Gen. Pinochet's trip. 
  [Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona recording] To be 
quite frank, the Socialist Party is not responsible for Gen. 
Pinochet acting like a teenager in Europe. 
  [RN President Andres Allamand recording] We are in favor of 
complete honesty. Therefore, likewise we fully support 
clarifying what happened in Codelco [Copper Corporation]; we 
also are all for the Chamber of Deputies receiving all the 
information regarding this trip abroad that, moreover, was 
authorized by the government. We always have upheld honesty. 
But disclosing information on this trip has nothing to do with 
the hideous and usually rude language with which Deputy Naranjo 
refers to the Army commander. [end recording] 
  Gen. Pinochet has been in Switzerland for the past three 
days. His presence in Lucerne has prompted protest in political 
circles. Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti stated that there 
is deep unrest in his country due to the Chilean military 
officer's visit. 
  It was leaked that Gen. Pinochet also might travel to 
England 
or Brazil, and that he is scheduled to return to Chile after 20 
June.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 8 June (EFE) -- After hearing the 
allegations of the parties involved, the Chilean Military Court 
today decided to postpone its ruling on whether to indict 
Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange on charges of 
nonfulfillment of military duties. 
  The charges are based on a ruling issued by Judge Milton 
Juica. Juica established that Stange and five other Carabineros 
officers failed to help clear up the slaying of three Communist 
leaders in 1985, better known as the decapitations case. 
  On 31 March Judge Juica sentenced three former Carabineros 
members to life imprisonment for the triple killing. He also 
sentenced to up to 18 years in prison 12 other former 
Carabineros members and one civilian. All of them were members 
of the now defunct Carabineros Intelligence Directorate 
(Dicomcar), a kind of secret police. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the Colombian presidential 
runoff election scheduled for 19 June. 
  Andres Pastrana has issued a message to farmers during 
Agriculture Day along with the four-point program he plans to 
implement. The program includes the identification of priorities 
in the agriculture sector, emergency policies to deal with the 
top problems, and "the giving of resources and delegation of 
concrete responsibilities so that the rural area can once again 
have owners." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 Jun 94 
p 6a) 
  During his first tour after the 28 May elections, Liberal 
Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper has visited the 
coastal area and proposed new measures to mitigate the economic 
situation in the border and rural areas. He has said his 
proposal for the border area included "the extension of the 
value-added tax, tax exemptions for new industries, and the 
renegotiation of commercial debts." Pastrana has also reported 
several liberal leaders in Santa Fe de Bogota, Cauca, Tolima, 
and Narino have offered him their support. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
Inravision Television Canal A Network in Spanish 1800 GMT 4 Jun 
94) 
  Samper met with coffee producers in Manizales recently. In 
his speech, he called on the government to make another 
readjustment in the price of the 125-kg sack of coffee and set 
it at 150,000 pesos. He said he was not satisfied with the 
recent readjustment, "because the international price is 
currently between $1.50 to $1.60 per pound, and the coffee 
producer is getting approximately 82 cents; that is, half the 
price of a pound of coffee." In Caldas, Samper talked about the 
peace talks, saying "I will clearly establish the negotiations 
agenda. I promise I will respect human rights during my 
administration, will not allow paramilitary activities, and will 
also ask the guerrillas to comply with the commitments to 
respect human rights." (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
6 Jun 94 p 6a) 
  Led by Antonio Navarro Wolff, the 19 April Movement 
Democratic Alliance assembly has decided not to back the 
conservative or liberal parties in the upcoming runoff 
elections. Ernesto Samper is seeking votes everywhere and has 
even accepted the support of extreme rightist General Oscar Maza 
Marquez. Andres Pastrana is also preparing for the runoff and 
plans to continue his strategy to strengthen his base of 
support. Both candidates are trying to obtain the votes of the 
large number of people who did not vote in the recent election. 
The national registrar has reported 7 million of 24 million 
eligible voters are not on the electoral listings and, thus, 
will be ineligible to vote. He added a new census of the 
population is necessary to enable all eligible citizens to vote.

<F P=106> [Report by Milina Villasana from the "Early Morning" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello has 
proposed on behalf of Mexico that the OECD assume international 
leadership in search of solutions to world economic problems. 
Mexico participated at the OECD meeting in Paris as the 25th 
member this organization. Tello presented to the organization's 
Council of Ministers an initiative that was backed by 
representatives from Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Spain. 
  On the last day of meetings, the Mexican foreign secretary 
asked the OECD to analyze the pertinence of institutions created 
as a result of the Cold War to prevent a duplication of efforts 
and to make operations more efficient. He said the organization 
is prepared to initiate a global analysis of the international 
economic cooperation system. 
  At the conclusion of the meeting, OECD President Jean Claude 
Baye said in a document that Mexico's membership in the OECD is 
a wonderful development. The OECD president added that OECD 
members view the beginning of a new phase of development for the 
organization and are pleased with Mexico's contribution. 
  This is the first time Mexico has participated as a full 
member since it officially joined the organization in April. 
The OECD includes the world's most industrialized countries.

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] There is increasing evidence that the ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty] could be operating in Mexico. New 
Spanish Justice Minister Juan Alberto Belloch's priority is to 
eliminate ETA terrorism. As for the ETA's presence in Mexico, 
the minister said it does exist and that its members could be 
active. 
  [Begin recording] [Belloch] We have suspicions. We and the 
Mexican authorities have nothing more than suspicions. We 
suspect that some of them could be active ETA militants. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What do you mean when you say active 
ETA militants? 
  [Belloch] They are people who have connections with the 
criminal organization and are potentially capable of providing 
economic support and could even cooperate with other terrorist 
groups, both in Mexico and Latin America. They could be 
planning to use Mexico as a springboard. The importance of 
Mexico in this regard is evident and they could be tempted to 
use Mexico as they did France. They may want to create an 
operations base with alliances with other forms of terrorism, 
adversely affecting both Mexico and other countries of Central 
America and Latin America. [end recording] 
  He added that he wants to visit Mexico to meet with his 
Mexican counterpart and exchange viewpoints. 
  [Begin Belloch recording] There is great interest in 
visiting 
your country. I would like to have a relationship similar to 
the one we currently have with France in the analysis of this 
topic. I believe it is appropriate to take preventive actions 
instead of waiting for them to consolidate a stable base in 
Mexico, which Spain and Mexico both are evidently not interested 
in. [end recording] 
  Belloch said it is not possible for the ETA to carry out 
attacks in Mexico today, but if the problem is not dealt with 
now, it could do so in the future. 
  The truth is that since last week, when Spanish Justice 
Minister Juan Alberto Belloch traveled to Paris to meet with his 
French counterpart, Charles Pasqua [name as heard], the efforts 
to fight terrorism have been greatly intensified even though 
they had reached a high level in the past few years, especially 
since 1984. In the last few days, heavy blows have been dealt 
to the ETA with new arrests.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  Through 31 May, the National Action Party, PAN, spent 12.5 
million new pesos. The PAN urged the other parties to publicly 
disclose their finances and stated that it has well-founded 
doubts regarding financial reports presented by the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI. In Chiapas, 60,000 
people left the Party of the Democratic Revolution, PRD, to 
protest the way party leaders nominated candidates. (Mexico City 
XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  On the occasion of Freedom of the Press Day on 7 June, PRD 
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solarzano signed a 
document advocating the creation of a pluralistic social 
communication council that would guarantee freedom of 
expression. Cardenas said freedom of the press in Mexico is 
still very limited. Labor Party, PT, presidential candidate 
Cecilia Soto Gonzalez said she received death threats last week. 
She rejected that such threats could affect the coming 
elections, however. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 
0000 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  PT's Soto underscored during a meeting with teachers that 
only a coalition government will be able to meet the needs and 
demands posed by Mexico's current situation. As for the 
skirmish between PAN and PT militants over destruction of PT 
political propaganda by PAN followers in Durango, Soto noted 
that the PAN attitude is censurable. (Mexico City Radio ACIR 
Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 9 Jun 94) 
  Also on Freedom of the Press Day, the presidential 
candidates 
made an unprecedented joint appearance before the media. PRI 
candidate Ernesto Zedillo indicated that there are two 
candidates who seek to tarnish Mexico's image. He added that 
Mexico has problems, but it also has victories and great 
potential. Intolerance should not prevail and there is 
intolerance when constitutional reforms that have received the 
support of most Mexicans are being criticized, he added. 
Zedillo criticized Cardenas' intolerance and uncivilized 
attitude while urging his opponents to hold "personal dialogues" 
to ensure clean elections. 
  Alvaro Perez Trevino, candidate for the Authentic Party of 
the Mexican Revolution, stated: "I will not invest a penny for 
glory. We will strive so Mexicans have a guaranteed access to 
jobs, health care, welfare, and education." 
  Popular Socialist Party candidate Marcela Lombardo said it 
is 
unfair to try to establish a bipartite system in Mexico, and 
Mexico wants a genuine democratic regime to strengthen its 
sovereignty. 
  The PRD's Cardenas denounced the existence of shady 
relations 
between the government and some media, and accused private 
television of becoming one of the pillars of the PRI. Cardenas 
also accused the PAN of condoning the alleged "electoral fraud" 
that gave the victory to President Salinas in 1988. 
  National Opposition Union candidate Pablo Madero stressed: 
"Democracy feeds on tolerance and respect for the will of 
people. The tripartite system seeks to trade with the popular 
vote." 
  Rafael Aguilar, candidate for the Cardenist Front for 
National Reconstruction Party, claimed that following the last 
debate, there was a feeling that an arrangement outside the 
popular will had been concocted. In this arrangement, the PRI 
secured the presidency before 21 August while the PAN and the 
PRD candidates obtained the first and second vice presidencies 
beforehand. 
  Mexican Green Ecologist Party candidate Jorge Gonzalez 
argued: "Mexico demands justice, honesty, democracy, and 
congruity in politics and public administration. Colosio's case 
has become a mockery of Mexicans. The corruption that pervades 
the police force and the judicial system is becoming unbearable." 
  PT's Cecilia Soto said: "I want to urge you to build a 
bridge 
so that Mexicans can overcome apathy, intolerance, and the 
inability to conceive a new way of life for Mexicans." (Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  The private sector has voiced mixed views regarding the 
10-point proposal presented by Ernesto Zedillo. The Mexican 
Council of Businessmen stated the proposal was clear and precise 
and that it will lead Mexico to steady growth in 1995. 
  Meanwhile, Raimundo Artiz, president of the National 
Processing Industry Association, said Zedillo's presentation was 
just a campaign speech and will not help solve the economic 
problems. Artiz added that if the PRI candidate wins, Mexico's 
economic prospects will be even worse than those of the last six 
years. 
  Salvador Lopez, president of the National Chamber of 
Commerce, noted that it was too soon to voice an opinion on 
Zedillo's proposal while urging the remaining candidates to 
present their proposals for the benefit of the public. 
  Eduardo Bours, president of the National 
Agricultural-Livestock Council, said Zedillo's proposal is part 
of a great national concern to give the countryside the 
significance it deserves because it suggested viable solutions 
that will help this sector grow. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in 
Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 12) 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, has visited 
Veracruz and said Mexicans are prepared for change and demand 
respect for the people's vote. Aguilar said there are favorable 
conditions for peace and social calm for the elections. (Mexico 
City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 June 94) 
  Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, presidential candidate for 
the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), has initiated a 
three-day tour of Puebla and Oaxaca States. In Acatlan, 
Cardenas has said the region has been abandoned and needs 
schools, rural roads, and irrigation works. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) 
  Diego Fernandez de Cevallos has visited Hermosillo, Sonora 
State, to meet with newspaper editors. He also visited 
neighborhoods in southern Hermosillo. As to the Colosio case, 
Fernandez said the final word has not been given, adding it is a 
very difficult crime to solve. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the Green 
Ecologist Party, has visited (Tlamanalco Municipality), Mexico 
State, and said one or two debates are not enough to discuss the 
great problems the country faces. Gonzalez has said at least 
three debates are necessary. (Mexico City XEW Television Network 
in Spanish 0430 GMT 3 June 94) 
  Gonzalez has visited Puebla and discussed problems in the 
agricultural sector. He discussed problems rural workers face 
throughout the country. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 4 June 94) 
  During a news conference, Marcela Lombardo Otero, 
presidential candidate for the Popular Socialist Party, has 
called on all Mexicans to denounce those who may try to promote 
violence during the 21 August elections. (Mexico City XEW 
Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) 
  Pablo Emilio Madero, presidential candidate for the National 
Opposition Union, has continued his campaign in Jalisco, where 
he met with a political committee and local media. Regarding 
the Colosio assassination, he has said: "It all seemed to 
indicate it was a plot, but to say it was an assassin who acted 
alone is a simplistic view." (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) 
  Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the Labor Party, 
has 
visited Guadalajara and protested because her party has been 
excluded by the Government Secretariat from holding negotiations 
on political reform. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in 
Spanish 0430 GMT 4 June 94) 
  PRI presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo has announced in 
Tlanepantla Municipality, Mexico State, one of the most 
industrialized in the country, he will implement a policy for 
the creation of jobs. "My intention is to draft an economic 
policy to promote investments because investments generate 
stable, productive, well-paying jobs," Zedillo has said. He 
added his biggest challenge will be to create 10 million jobs 
before the year 2000, when all fiscal and tax obstacles faced by 
businessmen should be eliminated. (Mexico City XEW Television 
Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 3 June 94) 
  Zedillo had a breakfast meeting with members of the 
Permanent 
Agrarian Congress in Mexico City. During the meeting, Zedillo 
said the crisis in the countryside has produced sad faces, 
discouragement, and even violence, as in the case of Chiapas. 
Zedillo said peasants do not understand the Program of Direct 
Support to the Countryside. He said the government should stop 
subsidizing poverty and the state should end paternalistic 
policies. (Mexico City Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0000 GMT 4 
June 94) 
  Speaking to university students from public and private high 
schools, Zedillo said differences can be overcome through 
dialogue and debate, adding that pressure by inflexible minority 
groups do not scare him. Zedillo also talked about the 
environment and said he who contaminates it should pay for the 
damage, and he who protects the environment must be rewarded. 
(Mexico City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 
GMT 6 June 94) 
  Zedillo has promised a 10-point program to foster investment 
and economic growth in Mexico. Zedillo explained the program 
during the Economic Growth for Family Well-Being Forum held in 
Mexico City. He said: "Mexicans have made great efforts to 
stabilize the economy in an unprecedented process of sacrifices 
by all." (Paris AFP in Spanish 2212 GMT 6 June 94)

  [Text] Quito, 9 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Joint police and Army 
operations to locate two U.S. oil technicians who were abducted 
in Ecuador's Amazon region have yielded no results yet, it was 
reported here. Intense land and air searches were conducted over 
a broad area of eastern Sucumbios Province, along the border 
with Colombia. 
  U.S. Ambassador Peter Romero confirmed on Tuesday the 
disappearance of his countrymen Eldon Lee Horton and Clyde Nolan 
Killgore. The U.S. citizens, employees of the Intairdrill 
drilling company, had been missing since last weekend when they 
were seen in the oil town of Shushufindi. 
  Press reports in Quito indicated that as a result of the 
investigations conducted in Sucumbios in the past few hours the 
police had arrested several suspects, apparently Colombians and 
Ecuadoreans. 
  According to sources close to the police, the oil 
technicians 
were presumably taken by their captors to the Colombian side of 
the border, which would further hamper the rescue. Commander 
Ruben Barahona told newsmen that different organized crime 
groups operate in this conflict-ridden area of Ecuador's Amazon 
region. Barahona added that in that area drug traffickers, among 
their other activities, are responsible for the transfer of 
precursor chemicals that are used in Colombia to process the 
drug. "Criminal and drug activities have made the place very 
dangerous," the official indicated. 
  Despite intense operations by the Armed Forces and the 
police, whose collaboration was requested by the diplomatic 
mission, authorities conceded today that they do not have any 
concrete leads to find the missing persons. 
  At least five U.S. citizens, including two technicians of 
U.S. oil companies in Sucumbios, were kidnapped in past years. 
In most cases, the kidnappees were rescued, but no specifics 
exist on the conditions or the ransom agreed upon for their 
release. 
  Administration Secretary General Carlos Larreategui denied 
that the recent wave of kidnappings registered in various 
locations of the country is related to a subversive group. 
Larreategui blamed the kidnappings on common crime and stressed 
that the only armed group known in Ecuador, referring to the 
"Red Sun," announced its demobilization and turned its weapons 
in to military authorities. 
  However, presumed "Red Sun" militants who broke away from 
those who negotiated the peace have told the media from hiding 
that they will continue their activities and the armed struggle.

  [Text] Quito, 9 Jun (EFE) -- It was reported today that the 
Quito criminal court has established that the Ecuadoran Armed 
Forces Bank had participated in the "laundering" of money coming 
from drug trafficking activities and confirmed the arrest of the 
bank's main officials. 
  The Quito Superior Court did not reveal the amount of money 
"laundered." It issued its conclusion prior to announcing the 
guilty verdict by two of its three members. Judge Janeth 
Calderon did not assign any responsibilities in this case. 
  The Ruminahui Bank manages the Ecuadoran Army, Navy, and Air 
Force resources. The verdict confirmed the arrest of Jose 
Racines, the former general manager of the military bank, and 
five other bank employees who were arrested in 1992 after the 
so-called "Magi Kings" group was dismantled. This is the only 
organization that, according to the police, has the 
characteristics of a drug cartel in Ecuador. 
  Racines and his subordinates, all of them civilians, were 
discharged from their posts by the military command after the 
Bank Superintendency [Superintendencia de Bancos] investigated 
the operations of the Ruminahui Bank, now in the process of 
being privatized. 
  Its new manager, General Gustavo Herrera, declared recently 
that bank operations had returned to their former standards. He 
added that up to last month, at least 10 Ecuadoran and foreign 
banking institutions had expressed interest in purchasing 30 
percent of the bank's stock. In the coming days, the Ruminahui 
Bank will decide on the best offer. It will favor the financial 
group which guarantees a sound consortium that will provide the 
technology and capital "to compete with other private 
institutions in the country and abroad," Herrera said. 
  Defense Minister Gen. Jose Gallardo has asserted that he 
does 
not dismiss the possibility that the group selected will be 
foreign. However, he emphasized, this "has to be studied in 
detail due to the origin of the banking organization." 
  Eighty-one percent of the bank's shares--whose reserves 
amounted to $3.6 million through June 1993--belong to the Armed 
Forces and 19 percent to the remaining 2,500 minority 
shareholders.

  [Text] After signing the Chapultepec Declaration this 
morning in Government House, and despite the fact that he does 
not agree with "the unfounded campaigns directed at personal 
reputations," President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated that his 
administration is committed to the unrestricted free development 
of the press. 
  In the Independence Hall of Government House the chief of 
state stressed that the signing of the document was another way 
of following up on his democratic convictions, as well as on his 
pledge to the Paraguayan people that he would comply with the 
Constitution and see to it that it was complied with. 
  "Before signing this document, I have with satisfaction 
verified that its contents perfectly reflect the reality of my 
country regarding freedom of expression," the chief of state 
emphasized. 
  Wasmosy recalled a saying of former U.S. President Thomas 
Jefferson, who said that if he had to choose between a 
government and a free press, he would not hesitate to opt for 
the latter at the expense of the former. 
  "He stressed this at a time when as president of the United 
States he was the favorite target of a series of cruel 
pamphlets. The names of those yellow publications have already 
been forgotten, while the figure of Jefferson continues to grow 
in the esteem of his people," the chief of state said, alluding 
to his current situation with respect to a certain sector of the 
media. 
  "I cannot find a better maxim than this one to describe my 
feelings regarding the media," he said. 
  Wasmosy expressed his disagreement with what he termed 
"personal slander campaigns," although he did not mention 
specifics. He did, however, allege "that at no time can there be 
any doubt about the commitment" of his administration "to 
maintain and encourage unrestricted freedom."

<F P=106> [Article by Reinaldo Montefilpo Carvallo: "The Political </F>
Romance With General Oviedo"] 
  [Text] The sarcastic [Ramon] Menendez Pidal [1869-1968, 
Spanish humanist] once told a hostile journalist who stinted on 
praise of the former's philological achievements: "A willful 
lack of memory coupled with the personal interest in refusing to 
acknowledge the truth are largely responsible...." This "willful 
lack of memory" brings to mind President [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy's 
comments that General [Lino Cesar] Oviedo has nothing to do with 
the ANR [National Republic Association-Colorado Party]. He 
uttered these remarks in the wake of a pronouncement by ANR 
precincts about meddling by this military officer. After a 
matter of a few short weeks, the president--feigning total 
ignorance--has no idea what ties the wily old general has with 
his own party. It is a cardinal error to believe public opinion 
is blind and deaf. 
  Interference by Gen. Oviedo in partisan politics in support 
of one ANR faction is conspicuously evident. This is nothing 
new. He has participated in meetings for months--and while 
refraining from disclosing the true objectives of his medium- 
and long-term plan--he has intentionally encouraged his friends 
and followers. He takes pride in exhibiting his allegiance to 
the Colorado Party and his adamant intention of keeping it in 
power for ever. The Colorado Party members who are secretly in 
love with him still believe it is irrelevant to display 
democratic behavior or consolidate the electoral majority. They 
favor the one who has the power that weapons confer on him in 
order to assure their political preeminence and de facto 
command. From an elementary civic standpoint, the stance of many 
Colorado Party members--the most retardative ones--vindicates 
our fateful past in the style of [General Alfredo] Stroessner 
and a new takeover of the ANR by a military clique. 
  The opposition, which understandably fears the ambitious 
general, will try to investigate and punish--if need be--his 
meddling in politics. This may be a useless charge rather than 
an appropriate and sensible action. Beside being a somewhat 
dangerous adventure, confronting a general in our country is 
just an obdurate waste of breath. 
  While it is true that Oviedo is gaining popularity among 
many 
Colorado Party members, many believe it is illogical to continue 
a false alliance with him. Yet there are those who feel at ease 
under the protection of this ubiquitous military officer and 
encourage the romance in spite of all obstacles. After all, one 
cannot deny he is putting on a good show.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government will take forceful measures to 
confront the transportation strike that was declared by the 
Single Union of Independent Vehicles and that threatens to 
completely stop transportation services on 13 June. Vicente 
Briceno filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Briceno] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar 
Salom made this statement as he walked out of the Security 
Cabinet meeting, which was supposed to be held on 9 June but 
instead was held on 8 June due to actions by the transportation 
union and pressure reportedly exerted by the public in light of 
the ever-increasing crime rate. 
  The interior minister and Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz 
agreed that the dispute between two rival factions within the 
union because of different party affiliations is the reason for 
this strike. 
  Although Escovar said that military buses will be used for 
public transportation, he refused to say whether the concessions 
granted to drivers will be revoked. However, he hinted this 
possibility is being considered. 
  [Escovar] We cannot let a union decide the fate of a city of 
four million people. The government will not accept it. This 
move to declare a transportation strike lacks the complete 
support of all workers. The government will respond with 
forceful measures nevertheless. 
  [Briceno] He also reported that the Security Cabinet 
analyzed 
the issue of burgeoning crime and delinquency rates. He added 
that among the solutions, he studied the possibility of sending 
smaller high-risk delinquents to separate rehabilitation 
centers, and the Juvenile Delinquents Law being applied to other 
delinquents, depending on the felonies they commit. 
  It is worth noting that in addition to the Caracas governor 
and the justice, foreign affairs, and defense ministers, who 
make up the Security Cabinet, attending the meeting, Family 
Minister Mercedes Pulido de Briceno was also present. [end

<F P=106> [Report by Paola Badaracco] </F>
  [Text] Justice Minister Ruben Creixems yesterday disagreed 
with the idea of civilian armed groups or death squads taking 
the administration of justice into their own hands. "The states 
must solve their security problems in accordance with the law, 
fully respecting human rights, and following legally established 
procedures," he said. 
  All of these situations are irregular, are even an offense 
classified by Venezuelan law as a crime, that of taking justice 
into one's own hands. One single person should not determine who 
is guilty or innocent, or apply the sentence that best suits him 
as judge. That would be terrible for society, he added. 
  Regarding the Catia Prison, he said the idea is to close it 
down but that it has been impossible because there is no 
available room in other prisons to transfer the inmates. The 
solution of this problem will take some time because new prisons 
have to be built. The Catia Prison cannot be repaired because of 
its dilapidated condition. In addition, it is not normal these 
days to have prisons in the center of cities. "Prisons must be 
on the outskirts. When Catia was built, it met this requirement 
but now it has been engulfed by the city." Nevertheless, he 
admitted that society is desperate for a degree of insecurity, 
although the crime rate has experienced a remarkable reduction. 
  Asked about the "Lights Against Criminals" organization, the 
minister said he does not know its members but is of the opinion 
that this is a civilian movement legally pressuring the 
government to find a solution to the insecurity problem while 
contributing commonsense ideas that should be taken into 
consideration. 
  Regarding the possibility of this being a rightist movement, 
he said it would be necessary to investigate but added that not 
everyone who declares himself against crime is a Fascist or a 
rightist. It will have to be looked into because I do not have 
sufficient information to express an opinion on the personal, 
philosophical, or ideological features of the members of this 
organization. I am under the impression that they are a group of 
worried persons who contribute ideas, sometimes extreme ideas. I 
do not think, however, that they are seeking violent solutions 
or taking justice into their own hands. If this is the case, it 
should be strongly rejected because we believe in a de jure 
state and an established administration of justice, he said. 
  As for the interior minister's proposal to reactivate Isla 
del Burro, Creixems recalled that, once the Executive Branch has 
decided to open a prison, his office must update and manage it. 
He explained that the money for carrying out Minister Escovar 
Salom's proposal are not included in the budget, but that if the 
proposal is accepted, the money could be secured. Anyway, he 
pointed out that it is up to the Urban Development Ministry to 
secure the money for any renovations. 
  Consulted over the resignation of some magistrates because 
of 
their low salaries, Creixems said the situation is dramatic and 
admitted that the public officials are underpaid. He regretted 
that competent and efficient magistrates resign because of low 
salaries and leave their posts to officials who are not overly 
concerned with salary. "I do not mean that those who do not 
resign are scoundrels. But we are in a situation in which 
high-level officials, with very great responsibilities, are 
pressured by the economic crisis and the scant money they earn, 
which prevents them from leading a decent life consistent with 
their profession," he said. 
  The minister said that a Security Council will meet next 
Thursday where everything related to the matter and the 
solutions proposed by the Executive Branch will be discussed. 
Once measures are decided on, they will be announced as 
political measures.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Today, some of the people who 
remain inside the Belgian Embassy in Cuba appeared at the 
portion of the fence most visible from the street to ask the 
international media for help and to insist, once again, that 
they are prepared to die. 
  The group of approximately ten people displayed three 
posters 
in English. The posters read: "We need your help to be free," 
"Freedom or die," and "We want to talk to the international 
press." 
  Newsmen, photographers, and television cameramen who are on 
permanent watch on the other side of the street caught sight of 
a man with an infant in his arms, a man giving the victory sign, 
and a third man making gestures about taking his own life. 
  One week ago, the refugees who on 28 May stormed into the 
residence of the Belgian ambassador smuggled out a communique 
rejecting any kind of dialogue with authorities and cautioning 
that they are prepared to do anything, "including die." 
  Both Cuban and Belgian officials agree that the 118 refugees 
must leave the building peacefully and must go through normal 
departure procedures, but they noted that the solution to the 
conflict will be difficult because of staunch resistance by the 
occupants. 
  Official Cuban sources have reiterated that the island's 
authorities have given written guarantees that the refugees will 
not be penalized for the crime of illegally breaking into a 
diplomatic mission.

<F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program hosted by Osvaldo Rodriguez of </F>
BOHEMIA magazine with Jose Alejandro Rodriguez of JUVENTUD 
REBELDE newspaper; date not given -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [O. Rodriguez] I think that, as has been analyzed on 
previous occasions, in a society like ours, money hoarders must 
get their resources from state funds and state stores. Compared 
to a continental nation, there are no borders through which 
contraband could enter here. These money hoarders do not import 
anything from abroad, they have no contacts abroad, so they get 
everything here, they steal everything, they divert everything 
from state resources. I believe this is a very important issue 
because if we are trying to fully eradicate the problem and 
prevent it from ever occurring again, we must go to the root of 
the problem and investigate why these money hoarders emerge as 
tycoons, as we have seen in some recently published cases. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Yes, Osvaldo. Evidently, the money hoarders, 
this phenomenon of ill-gotten wealth, as you said, does not come 
from abroad, from outside our country. As you said, we are an 
island; there are no private suppliers or warehouses here. There 
are joint enterprises, but these have obligations to the state 
rather than to individuals. 
  [O. Rodriguez] These enterprises have very little stolen 
from 
them because they have the best control methods. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Of course, because they do not want to lose 
revenue. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Not only that, I believe they have very good, 
effective control methods, so very little pilferage takes place. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Yes. Now what happens, this phenomenon that 
we 
face... [pauses] many times we see only the final result of the 
phenomenon. It is true we must counter the phenomenon of 
ill-gotten wealth, and it is true that a series of measures have 
already been implemented; but we must also investigate how this 
happens, what factors allow it, what phenomena in our society 
encourage or endorse this behavior and these actions. Osvaldo, 
it is also true that the great amount of resources they handle 
can come only from our own enterprises' warehouses. 
  The country has a deficit of raw materials and products in 
every sector -- we know that even pins are scarce in our country 
-- so we cannot understand how reports on the first results of 
the operations indicate that certain products, which are stored 
and controlled by the state, end up in these persons' houses. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Large amounts of fuel -- fuel we do not have, 
Comrade. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Yes, of course. 
  [J. Rodriguez] We do not have it and we are experiencing 
great problems in the energy sector. We find that these people 
have even stored oil. That oil comes from a base, from a.... 
  [O. Rodriguez interrupting] A state-owned base. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Certainly. A state-owned base. No one here 
gets a tank of oil by mail from another country. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Certainly, certainly not. They also have soy, 
fodder, and cement. They have built large houses. How do you 
build a large house? You can build a large house only by 
stealing the materials. Everyone knows that. Those who have 
built houses on their own know how difficult it is to complete 
one. In normal times -- we are not talking about the crisis, we 
are talking about normal times when it was easier to get 
construction materials -- it takes many comrades three, four, or 
five years to build their houses. Sometimes it takes 10 years 
because it also depends on the financial resources available. 
Well, these people are capable of building three-story houses, 
eight-room houses, mansions in six months. These people have 
undoubtedly stolen a considerable part of those materials from 
the state. Of course, I do not think they have stolen all of the 
materials from the state. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Obviously. 
  [O. Rodriguez] These people also have other things -- for 
example, cars and motorcycles. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Of course, of course. The main source of 
their 
riches, meaning the profitable thing -- that which allows a 
person to achieve a status that is 15 or 20 times higher than 
that of any citizen -- is essentially a result of the products 
stolen from the business sector due to the lack of controls. 
  [O. Rodriguez] I think our reasoning about the lack of 
controls should be expounded upon so that we make our listeners 
aware of the individual participation that each one can have in 
this control. Whenever we think about control, we think about 
the enterprise's director or manager, and we forget about the 
warehouse employee, the driver, the receptionist, the clerk, 
everyone. Those who do not handle the resources at least get to 
see them. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Of course. 
  [O. Rodriguez] They see the merchandise; they see when it is 
removed; and they can remain alert to any developments. 
  [J. Rodriguez] Look, Osvaldo, there is a specific example of 
this phenomenon about the lack of control. It was discussed even 
during the previous period of sessions at the National Assembly 
of the People's Government. It is one of the cardinal problems 
that must be tackled head-on. I am talking about the lack of 
discipline in bills and payments between enterprises. 
  [O. Rodriguez] This helps to hide the pilfering. 
  [J. Rodriguez] All the pilfering. For example, I am a 
supplier of detergent, and you are the dry cleaning enterprise 
-- this is a hypothetical example, unrelated to any particular 
case. I send you a monthly amount. All this has to be supported 
by documentation. This is why accounting was invented; it has no 
other purpose. The problem is to make people comply with the 
accounting system. At times, we ask ourselves: Why is this not 
followed? I am convinced there are people, managers, who have 
not attributed the proper importance to economic control, but 
there are also people who benefit from the lack of economic 
control, shoddy accounting, and a lack of strictness because 
otherwise, they would lose their supply line. We mention the 
lack of discipline in billing and payments. I send you the 
detergent and that has to be accounted for by documents that we 
both sign. You buy the detergent and I supply the detergent. If 
you never pay me through the bank or by documents for my 
shipment however, what guarantee do I have that the shipment 
made it to your enterprise? This is how much of the pilfering 
has been accomplished. This detergent is later sold to us on a 
street corner -- a little can of detergent costs I do not recall 
how much. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Yes. If I did not pay for it, if it did not 
make it to my inventory, I do not have to answer for what I did 
not pay for. Yet, I received the product. 
  [J. Rodriguez] There are two possibilities: Either you are a 
foolish businessman -- a luxury we cannot afford -- or you are 
aware of what you are doing and are promoting the lack of 
control, which benefits many individuals. This is also what 
happens. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Yes. I think this example is very 
enlightening. I believe it reflects why the billing and payments 
problem continues. I believe this example, which is 
hypothetical, as you pointed out, takes place over and over at 
hundreds of enterprises. 
  [J. Rodriguez] If it was a foreign company, they would make 
sure they were paid what they are owed because it affects their 
profits. However, since at times we separate the two -- this is 
for the state, not for me -- then we do not worry, and John Doe 
is expected to pay. 
  [O. Rodriguez] Yes, I think your reasoning is logical, but I 
would like to slightly disagree with what you said at the end. 
You said that if there is a foreign company, they make sure they 
get their money. I believe there are many Cuban enterprises and 
state enterprises that get paid. We have mentioned negative 
examples here of foolish managers or managers who are 
voluntarily on the take. There are also many honest, good 
managers, however, who have other problems with their 
enterprises in achieving control. There are other reasons, such 
as structure, guidelines, excessive centralization of the 
decision-making process, and other things. There are places that 
observe control measures, however. In Cuba, we have places that 
are exemplary in terms of controls, not only in the civilian 
sector, but also in the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. The 
industrial enterprises of the FAR are a good example of 
controls. I believe that you have written in JUVENTUD REBELDE, 
and earlier in TRABAJADORES, about control and how there are 
places, warehouses etc., where even the smallest screw is 
controlled, and nothing gets lost. 
  [J. Rodriguez] I believe this is, above all, a problem about 
political willingness. As you say, there are many enterprises 
that have always displayed a great zeal for strict controls. 
This also depends on the combined willingness of the people 
involved and their awareness of its importance. 
  Before, we used to say: Yes, we must meet the plan at any 
cost. That was a standard cliche. At this juncture, however, in 
terms of the economic endeavor, and above all, because of the 
way we are pressured and affected by the national economic 
situation, we cannot afford to lose even a pin. This is one of 
the essential problems. We have conducted campaigns for 
trustworthiness in accounting, and plans to control rotations 
and essential resources. We have done all kinds of things. Many 
more things can be developed, however. But what is decisive is 
the human and political will to protect the resources. 
  [O. Rodriguez] I believe that individual responsibility is 
needed even more, a commitment to watch over those resources. 
  Returning to the initial subject: What has been seized from 
money hoarders demonstrates that there is a lack of control in 
many places. They have great amounts of spare parts, cars, fuel, 
and resources. Therefore, I believe those are the cracks in the 
state economy that permit the emergence of money hoarders, their 
wealth, and their continued abuse of the rest of the population.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 9 Jun (AFP) -- Dominican Republic 
President Joaquin Balaguer justified the presence of U.S. 
military officers along his country's border with Haiti, saying 
it is the result of an agreement with Bill Clinton and UN envoys 
William Gray and Dante Caputo. 
  In statements to the press on Thursday, Balaguer said the 
Haitian military leaders' Dominican bank accounts have not been 
frozen. 
  Twelve U.S. Atlantic Command officers arrived at Santo 
Domingo on 8 June and immediately transferred to the Haitian 
border where they are coordinating with the operations of "their 
Dominican counterparts" to prevent violations of the UN-decreed 
embargo against Haiti. 
  The Balaguer government's agreement with Caputo and Gray 
includes sending helicopters and sea craft to prevent the entry 
of fuel and other articles to Haiti that the embargo prohibits. 
  Although it has been said the arrival of helicopters would 
be 
imminent, only the presence in Dominican waters of the USS 
Cyclone and USS Tempest has been officially reported so far. 
  A diplomatic source consulted by AFP has said the arrival of 
the helicopters will depend on the report on "logistic needs" by 
the UN observer mission, which is comprised of approximately 60 
people, who should arrive shortly in the Dominican Republic.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- Honduran Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Paz Aguilar today declared that the American 
nations must work within the framework of the OAS and remain 
"flexible" in dealing with the situations in Cuba and Haiti. 
  Upon his return to Honduras, Paz also said the 110 members 
of 
the Nonaligned Movement support Honduras' candidacy for the UN 
Security Council seat, which is up for election in October. 
  During the recent nonaligned meeting in Egypt, Paz was 
invited to visit Cuba by his Cuban counterpart, Roberto Robaina. 
The Honduran minister would not say whether he had accepted the 
invitation. 
  The foreign minister said: Cuba must show signs of 
democratization in order to return to the OAS, and the rest of 
the inter-American community must be "flexible" in efforts to 
normalize the Cuban and Haitian situations. 
  He noted: "We support the democratization process in Cuba 
and 
the restoration of democracy in Haiti." The foreign minister 
indicated that both cases must be resolved peacefully within the 
framework of the OAS. 
  In the case of Haiti, the United States has proposed that 
Central America become a sanctuary for those fleeing from Haiti, 
but at the last meeting of the region's presidents, Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina said the United States "called on 
the wrong place." 
  In Honduras' Caribbean region, there are more than 50 
Haitians who do not want to stay in the country and have asked 
the government for visas to travel to either the United States 
or Canada. 
  Honduras broke diplomatic relations with Cuba in the 1960's.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- Chilean Foreign Minister 
Carlos Figueroa Serrano stressed on 8 June that his country "is 
not reviewing" the possibility of resorting to international 
arbitration over the Continental Glaciers issue while the treaty 
is under discussion by the two countries' Congresses. 
  The Chilean foreign minister made this remark during a news 
conference at Government House after a one-hour meeting with 
President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella. 
  During the meeting, which he described as "cordial and very 
positive," Figueroa Serrano presented Menem with Chile's 
proposal to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South] as an 
"independent country." Mercosur is an integration process 
involving Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay. 
  The visiting minister denied that during the meeting they 
reviewed aspects of a ruling the Rio de Janeiro Arbitration 
Court will have to issue within a few months on the Laguna del 
Desierto border conflict. 
  Instead the Chilean foreign minister extensively discussed 
the Continental Glaciers treaty and said his country "is not 
reviewing" the possibility of resorting to international 
arbitration. 
  Figueroa Serrano pointed out: "We have not discussed this 
issue, despite the fact that it is a formula that was included 
in the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, because Chile's and 
Argentina's position is that here there is a proposed treaty 
that settles the Continental Glaciers border problem." 
  Figueroa Serrano added that this solution "seems to be fair 
and compatible with the terms of the border treaties between 
Chile and Argentina and this is under discussion by the 
Congresses." 
  Figueroa Serrano emphasized: "We do not want to consider any 
other alternative contemplated in the 1984 treaty while this 
issue is under discussion by the two Congresses." 
  Figueroa added that during his meeting with Menem, "we 
reviewed the relationship between the two countries and were 
able to confirm the excellent level of our current relations." 
  Figueroa Serrano immediately emphasized the "very close 
relationship" existing between President Carlos Menem and 
President Eduardo Frei, who will have a chance to meet again in 
mid-June during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena 
[de Indias in Colombia] and, subsequently, on 25 and 26 August 
during a new working visit that the Argentine president will pay 
to Santiago.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar announced 
yesterday that the government will firmly promote the 
resolutions issued by the International Decade of the World's 
Indigenous People preparatory meeting held in Cochabamba. This 
meeting was attended by 120 representatives from Latin America 
and the Caribbean. 
  Aranibar asserted that these resolutions will play a 
relevant 
part in Bolivia's foreign policy. He said that the indigenous 
issue has become a stable and constant issue of discussion in 
Bolivia. Aranibar added that this reflects the important changes 
that have taken place in our country, and how much Bolivia can 
contribute at the Latin American and world level. 
  The resolutions approved at the meeting in Cochabamba are 
the 
result of a consensus achieved between government 
representatives, delegates from the various indigenous groups, 
and nongovernmental organization delegates. 
  According to Aranibar the document is based on the need to 
build a new order of relations between governments and 
indigenous peoples of the Americas. 
  Bolivia will raise the issue at both the OAS Assembly 
meeting, to be attended by the foreign minister; and at the 
Cartagena Ibero-American Summit to be attended by President 
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  The meeting in Cochabamba also decided to request those 
governments of the Americas that signed the agreement 
establishing the Indigenous Fund to expeditiously approve this 
agreement, so that it may implemented as soon as possible. 
  Aranibar said: "On behalf of President Sanchez de Lozada, I 
expressly request the cooperation of government delegates and 
indigenous group representatives so that the Indigenous Fund 
might become a reality. This agreement is a victory by the 
indigenous peoples of the Americas, and Bolivia is interested in 
implementing it." 
  The preparatory meeting sought to unify the criteria of 
Latin 
American and Caribbean countries on the issue before presenting 
it to the United Nations. The meeting was closed on 1 June by 
Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas and Foreign Minister 
Aranibar.

<F P=106> [Article by Gustavo Patu and Monica Izaguirre] </F>
  [Text] Central Bank [BC] figures have cast doubts over the 
possibility that the government will be able to balance its 
accounts, as is provided for in the Union's budget for 1994 and 
in the Real Plan. 
  According to BC estimates that were made available to FOLHA, 
interest payments on the foreign and domestic debts will surpass 
the $7.7 billion budget provision. 
  The BC estimates that such payments will amount to 2.1 
percent of the GDP (gross domestic product, or the goods and 
services produced by the country). This percentage amounts to 
from $9 billion to $10 billion, depending on the GDP figure. 
  This difference is enough to make government spending 
surpass 
the income provisions of the 1994 budget. In the budget bill 
submitted to Congress, government spending and income are equal. 
  Balancing government accounts is considered a foundation of 
the Real Plan, as it will prevent the government from printing 
money or contracting debts to pay its expenses. 
  The BC estimates were made in February and, according to BC 
technicians, they were not updated. The budget provision for 
paying the interest on the debt has remained unchanged since 
December. 
  PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] Deputy for Sao 
Paulo Barbieri, the rapporteur of the budget bill in the Chamber 
of Deputies, also suspects that the budget provision for 
repaying the debt is underestimated. 
  In a preliminary report, Barbieri said it was "very strange" 
that the $7.7 billion provision made in December had not been 
modified to match the rise in interest since the beginning of 
the year. 
  Since the end of 1993 interest rates have risen from about 
17 
percent annually above inflation to more than 30 percent. The 
domestic debt grew from $48 billion to $53.5 billion. 
  The IMF mission that looked into the government accounts in 
March shared this distrust. 
  The IMF considered that spending was underestimated and that 
part of the budget income was overestimated. The IMF preferred 
not to conclude an agreement with Brazil.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Cesar Gaviria with </F>
unidentified moderator and unidentified reporters in Neiva; 
broadcast in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Gaviria] ...all of the region's infrastructure was 
completely destroyed and many, many people are homeless. They 
have received some attention, but I am still worried about them. 
We are obliged to provide them with much better attention. I am 
going to work on that. The minister will remain at the site and 
I will return tomorrow to make sure we provide whatever support 
is needed for these people to receive better attention, so they 
can get more timely attention from the Colombian Government. We 
need to reinforce the logistics for each task. To this end, the 
generals of the Armed Forces and the ministers who came here 
with me, will stay on top of the situation to ensure that those 
displaced get more timely assistance in these coming days. 
  [Reporter] Mr. President, you made a direct commitment to 
aid 
the people here with housing, roads, and so on. Have you spoken 
with them? 
  [Gaviria] No. These people feel very bad, they are so very 
distressed about the general situation and because of the panic 
they experience from the continuing tremors, that no one wants 
to talk about rebuilding yet. This morning we spoke briefly 
about rebuilding roads and bridges. The acting manager and the 
person in charge of housing subsidies at the Agricultural Bank 
are here, the manager of the Presidency Social Emergency Fund 
and all the officials who have some responsibility concerning 
these events are also here. The governors have assessed the 
general situation, and we will be able to begin reconstruction 
work in a few days. Today and during the coming days our 
assistance must focus on making sure they all have shelter, 
food, medical attention, and some sort of social support. That 
is the priority task now. 
  [Monitor] A question from "QAP Newcast." 
  [QAP reporter] Mr. President, this morning you spoke about 
the need for international aid. After having assessed the 
situation, what would you ask the international community to 
provide? 
  [Gaviria] Basically what I asked for this morning. More than 
aid for this specific moment to assist the homeless, for food, 
or to give these families some warmth, we will need support in 
rebuilding the region, because the great majority of homes in 
the region were destroyed or severely damaged; not one single 
bridge is standing along any of the roads here, which leaves the 
region completely isolated; and the cost of rebuilding this 
region will be very high, very high [repeats himself]. Some 
places, where there used to be several corregimientos or towns, 
were buried by the landslides. There we must relocate the 
people. There are other places where the people will not want to 
go back because of the extensive landslides. The people in 
Belalcaza closed the town and fled to the nearby hills and now 
refuse to return. Many of them will probably not want to live 
there any more. The same happened in Irlanda, where the people 
abandoned the few homes and community areas left undamaged and 
probably will not want to go back. 
  [Moderator] Juan Carlos Matheus from Radio Caracol. 
  [Matheus] Are there any plans to create a fund to aid the 
people with education, housing, and health care, to prevent the 
government's effort from being lost? 
  [Gaviria] We are going to give all the victims subsidies. We 
will be offering housing subsidies to help all those who no 
longer have homes. However, that is not the priority job today. 
We cannot distract the people with that, because they are still 
in shock. They are still rescuing their injured, and we have 
hardly begun to set up tent sites and provide medical attention. 
We will not be able to talk to them about reconstruction efforts 
for a few days yet. We cannot even begin to talk about 
relocation. Many of these people will not want their homes to be 
in the same place they were before, because of the high risk. 
  [Moderator] Juan Pablo Diaz with the last question. 
  [Diaz] Mr. President. It is logical to say that 
reconstruction work on all these roads and towns will not be 
complete before you leave office in two months. How can you 
commit the incoming government to complete this task? 
  [Gaviria] I trust we will be able to establish a 
construction 
plan and leave with it already under way, using the funds from 
the government, the budget, housing subsidies, Social Emergency 
Funds, and the aid we are sure to receive from abroad. Obviously 
the incoming government will still have a responsibility to 
complete this effort and we are all sure they will.

<F P=106> [Speech by presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de </F>
Leon of the Institutional Revolutionary Party; at the "Economic 
Growth for Family Welfare" symposium in Mexico City on 6 June] 
  [Text] Ladies and Gentlemen: Today, speaking before the 
workers, farmers, union leaders, professionals, businessmen, and 
representatives of the financial and civilian sectors, I have 
come here to present my economic growth program for family 
welfare. Thank you very much for being here. All of you, who 
represent various fields and organizations, play pivotal roles 
in Mexico's economic situation. 
  Modern Mexico, the country with the institutions we enjoy 
today, is the result of long-fought social struggles, programs 
that were advanced through decades of hard work. This explains 
the striking clarity of the rebels' demands, the firmness and 
validity of the untiring Juarist struggle, and the surprising 
strength behind the Mexican Revolution's social motivations. 
  We Mexicans have been building the framework which regulates 
and guides the nation's mission, and which, in 1917, was 
asserted as the will of the Mexican people to become a 
representative, democratic Republic, comprising free and 
sovereign states united in a federation. 
  Under its protection, and under the leadership of the 
National Revolutionary Party, the Party of the Democratic 
Revolution [PRD], and the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
[PRI], Mexico has modernized. 
  We are gathered today because we all want a nation in which 
every child can go to school; in which every worker has a 
well-paying job that enables him to provide housing and health 
care for his family; in which there is no poverty that 
frustrates the talent, impedes the destiny, or offends the 
dignity of the Mexican people; and in which all of us can feel 
safe and have our rights protected. Today, more than ever, 
Mexicans want to enter the 21st century as part of a great 
nation based on social welfare, equity, and justice. 
  Today, I have come to talk about my commitment to economic 
growth, my firm commitment to an economic policy that will 
enable us to grow; to increase profit margins in the industrial, 
agricultural, and service sectors; and to generate more jobs and 
higher incomes for Mexican families. 
  During my campaign, I have stressed that the struggle 
against 
poverty will be a priority for my government. This is why I 
will soon present to the people an aggressive, robust, and 
participative strategy to promote social development. Today, I 
will focus on growth, the means through which we can generate 
jobs and higher wages and sustain the fight against poverty. 
  In recent years, we Mexicans have made great efforts to 
overcome the crisis of the 1980's. Structural imbalances, debt, 
and ill-timed participation in the international market all 
helped engender a substantial loss in terms of public welfare. 
  In facing these challenges, and in taking advantage of new 
opportunities, Mexico decided to become an active participant -- 
not a passive spectator -- in the change process affecting the 
world. This change of attitude, which was promoted by President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, was designed to face the crisis of 
the eighties, the crisis produced in the past decade, and to lay 
the various foundations for the country's future development. 
  Our economic reform has allowed us to do two things. First, 
a stabilization policy was applied, and, for the first time in 
more than two decades, annual inflation was reduced to less than 
2 percent. 
  This policy was based on reorganizing public finances and on 
a successful renegotiation of the public foreign debt. In this 
way, the government stopped imposing on the people the so-called 
inflationary tax, which is the most unfair tax there is, the one 
that hurts the lower classes the most. 
  Likewise, the public debt as a proportion of the GNP 
decreased by more than two-thirds, from 68 to 21 percent. 
Mexico went from being one of the most indebted countries in 
the world to the least indebted in relative terms among the 
member-states of the OECD. 
  Second, economic reform allowed us to implement a policy of 
structural change to modernize the productive sector. This, 
along with more efficient government methods, contributed to the 
increased channeling of resources into social programs, as well 
as to helping ease the effects of extreme poverty in many 
regions of the country. The government also has allocated 
resources for the expansion of the infrastructure and other 
productive sectors of the economy. This is why we must 
consolidate the structural changes made to public expenditures. 
  Thanks to a great collective effort, we certainly have made 
progress, although this progress has not completely redressed 
our shortcomings. Wide segments of our population still live in 
poverty. We are not creating enough jobs and many of the 
existing jobs are unstable or only part-time. Instead of a 
growing formal economy, we have a growing underground economy. 
The workers' real wages are insufficient and peasant incomes 
are too low. I have seen how many microbusinesses, small 
businesses, and medium-sided enterprises are having trouble 
surviving. 
  Also, we must be fully aware of the challenges we will have 
to face because of our population growth. Even though our 
population is increasing at a rate of 1.9 percent annually, the 
labor force is increasing at an annual rate of 3 percent. This 
shows that social and demographic pressure is still being 
applied to the labor market. Because our population is 
predominantly young, this pressure will not decrease for many 
years. We must create an average of 1 million jobs per year to 
employ the women and young people who are entering the job 
market. 
  We also know that because of demographic reasons, only 
one-third of the population is economically active. This is why 
it is imperative to substantially increase productivity in an 
effort to increase everyone's income. 
  Sustained growth demands greater productivity from everyone 
in a framework of economic stability in order to guarantee 
certainty and thereby encourage people to plan, invest, save, 
and work productively. 
  By eliminating inflation, we will put an end to one of the 
most damaging phenomena to the distribution of income. This is 
why I intend to keep inflation under control by maintaining 
healthy public finances. 
  We reject demagogic positions that call for greater 
expenditures and reduced prices for everything. This is 
impossible. In the past, such policies were carried out at a 
high social cost that was ultimately paid by the Mexican people. 
We cannot return to these practices. A policy of balanced 
public finances demands that we charge what is fair and only 
spend what is socially necessary. The proposal I am presenting 
to you today is realistic and responsible. 
  Our assessment is clear: We have made important progress in 
the consolidation of a flexible, modern, and participatory 
economy, but we still need to make additional progress to 
capitalize on these efforts and to attain greater levels of 
prosperity. 
  We, the Mexican people, have made great efforts to stabilize 
the economy and make the necessary structural changes. We have 
seen an unprecedented process of sacrifice on behalf of 
everyone, but it has been a necessary process and one that is 
worthwhile. Mexico already has laid a solid groundwork for the 
future. 
  The time has come to pass from stability and structural 
adjustment to a policy of promoting investment and economic 
growth. The time has come to pass from stressing macroeconomic 
concerns to ensuring microeconomic transformations. The time 
has come to enrich the nation's integration with the economic 
opening of each region. 
  There are very few nations that have the social energy and 
human skills exhibited during Mexico's structural change. We 
must now use these assets to develop production and promote 
growth. 
  The strategy we will adopt to encourage growth is based on 
equal participation, clear rules, and fair treatment for all the 
productive sectors. We need fair treatment for our producers in 
competition overseas, fair treatment for domestic producers in 
their relations with the government, and fair treatment between 
producers and the production forces. 
  Fair treatment for domestic producers means they will not be 
disadvantaged when competing in overseas markets. It means they 
will not have to pay more for public services and raw materials 
here than their competitors pay overseas. It means financial 
competition should be bolstered by interest rates in Mexico that 
are competitive with international rates. If we indeed opened 
the economy to enable foreign competition to encourage 
efficiency and productivity, we must also correct the unfair 
conditions under which our producers compete. 
  Fair treatment between the government and individuals means 
having a transparent and fair fiscal system. It means the 
people will be able to defend themselves from possible abuses of 
authority. It means state-run companies should be efficient and 
work to provide goods and services under competitive conditions 
that are contingent on quality and price. It means precise 
regulation, without excess, to effectively encourage economic 
activity. 
  Fair treatment between individuals means judicial security 
in 
labor-management contracts and combating monopolistic practices 
and abuses. It means healthy competition will be encouraged and 
privileges will be done away with. 
  For this reason, my economic policy will be governed by the 
principle of fair treatment. I promise to ensure fair treatment 
for everyone and every group, regardless of size, geographic 
area, or economic activity. Fair treatment is what each and 
every one of you demands. Fair treatment will be a fundamental 
responsibility at every level of the government. 
  We will create the jobs that Mexico requires. We will begin 
to walk along the path of steady growth. We will progress in a 
stable manner toward an economy of the future, a more 
participatory economy, and an economy that favors the well-being 
of the family. 
  This is why I am proposing to you, representatives of all of 
the nation's productive sectors, a 10-point strategy for the 
reactivation of the economy and steady growth. We need this 
economic reactivation because the Mexican people cannot accept 
stagnation. We must reactivate our economy quickly and 
effectively. Steady growth is important because we do not 
intend to simply grow in the short-term, but, instead, to 
consolidate a structural change so that the productive sector 
can take advantage of the opportunities provided by domestic and 
international markets. 
  In this proposal, I hereby make a pledge to lead our economy 
to grow in 1995 at a rate that at least doubles the population 
growth rate and to increase this growth rate gradually in the 
years that follow. We know how to do this, and we will do it 
together. 
  I hereby make a pledge for this strategy to remain 
consistent 
with macroeconomic stability and to have as its main pillar the 
promotion of private and public investment, as well as the 
promotion of exports. 
  The 10-point proposal I am presenting here today to you and 
the entire public does not originate from an insensitive cabinet 
report, but has been nurtured with proposals presented by 
workers, peasants, housewives, youths, executives, and students. 
It has also been nurtured with recommendations made by the 
business sector, researchers, and social activists throughout 
the country. It is a strategy prepared after intense 
consultation carried out in factories and workshops, in 
companies and ejidos, in classrooms and business establishments, 
in households as well as work stations. I am confident that 
Mexico's social and productive sectors will recognize their 
proposals in this strategy. It is a strategy intended to 
multiply their opportunities and attain their aspirations. The 
10 points for economic reactivation and sustained growth are as 
follows: 
<H5>  First: Investment Promotion, the Drive Behind Growth </H5>
  In order to create the jobs Mexicans are demanding, the 
economy must grow, and in order for this to take place, we must 
significantly increase investment. 
  Private investment is the basic drive behind sustained 
economic growth because it plays an irreplaceable role in the 
development of the productive sectors by prompting the capacity 
to encourage society's well-being. For this reason, the next 
government must place the highest priority on promoting 
investments. We will design and apply measures to increase 
project yields and create adequate settings for investments to 
grow, and employment along with it. 
  Foreign investments must continue to be the complementary 
support to national investments, since it allows the acquisition 
of leading technology, and represents a link with international 
flow of trade and production. We will promote conditions of 
legal protection and parity in order for foreign investment to 
continue its complementary role. 
  Public investment is also essential to promoting growth, 
most 
of all, if it serves to eliminate bottlenecks in strategic 
sectors and provide needed infrastructure for the expansion of 
economic activity. Public investment is an important lever for 
accomplishing balanced regional development. 
  We plan to select public and joint investments that will 
encourage greater employment opportunities, are better rewarded, 
and of greater social impact to the entire nation. These 
investments will adhere to clear-cut guidelines and social 
relevance in order to take advantage of the best resources our 
economy counts on. 
  I propose three concrete actions to reactivate public 
investment and thus encourage a significant volume of private 
investments. 
  First, I intend to increase public investments during my 
first year in office by an additional one-fourth of its current 
level. 
  Second, we intend to promote reforms that will allow 
multi-annual public investing budgeting, which will ensure 
certainty when financing medium- and long-term projects. 
  Third, in order to induce private sector participation in 
infrastructure projects, I propose the creation of an Investment 
Promotion Fund. 
  This fund will provide protection to investment projects and 
open the door to financing at rates and periods in accordance 
with their respective yield and maturity period. The fund will 
also be in a position to invest risk capital on a temporary and 
minority basis, in addition to being able to complement private 
investment. 
  This fund will be financed with resources originating from a 
Contingency Fund, funded with profits received from the 
segregation of public sector assets which up until now has been 
used to pay off the public debt. 
  This fund will be authorized to engage long term resources 
in 
the international markets when conditions are favorable for this 
purpose. The fund will operate with prudence and its resources 
will be earmarked for specific projects, the yield of which will 
guarantee repayment capacity. 
  Just as in the past, the priority need to reduce the public 
debt was well taken care of with money from privatizations 
[disincorporaciones], today, when the priority is to reactivate 
the economy, these resources will be used to stimulate 
investment in infrastructure projects. 
<H5>  Second: Investment in Education, Training, and Health </H5>
  The central objective of my economic policy proposal is to 
improve the standard of living of the Mexican family. We must 
devote special attention to investing in people. Higher 
education, better training, and better health services will be 
our social platform so Mexican workers can be more productive 
and earn higher salaries. 
  Education will be an undisputed priority item in my 
government. We must make a great effort and conduct a true 
national crusade to overcome the persisting backwardness of our 
education, improve its quality, and lay a sound foundation for 
personal realization and improvement. Education is the key for 
a future of development, well-being, and justice. 
  In addition, the technological revolution underlines the 
importance of workers' education and training. Technological 
progress tends to eliminate unqualified and semi-qualified jobs 
in all productive sectors. The new jobs require analytical 
ability and the ability to handle automatic or computerized 
equipment. To be competitive, we must substantially increase 
our efforts at training and investing in workers. 
  I hereby pledge that, during the next government term, the 
number of workers who receive specialized training every year 
will be multiplied by at least 500 percent. We will do it 
through government incentives, based on the structure and needs 
of the enterprises. We will expand the training program through 
scholarships and financial support for adults, employed or 
unemployed, who require adaptation to new production 
technologies. 
  Under the labor principle I have presented, that the only 
acceptable changes will be those leading to the workers' higher 
standard of living, we will encourage new forms of organization, 
which can make it possible for workers to move within 
enterprises and in and out of sectors. 
  We will reinforce and extend the system of technical studies 
and training for work. To stimulate the scope and quality of 
higher education and to encourage scientific and technological 
research to unprecedented levels will be one of the highest 
priorities in the strategy that I propose. 
  Our attention should also be focused on health. Health is an 
essential factor for human well-being and productivity. We will 
see to it that the financial requirements of the institutions in 
charge of caring for the workers' health will not unnecessarily 
increase the enterprises' costs because this would reduce 
competitiveness and limit the level of productive work. To 
progress simultaneously toward more jobs and better health, we 
will supervise the costs of the social security institutions, 
demanding higher efficiency from them. 
  We have a special responsibility to working women. We will 
create new mechanisms so they can have good day care centers and 
good security and social assistance services. In addition, we 
will make a great effort to incorporate into the social security 
system those workers who do not enjoy this benefit at present. 
  To invest in education, health, and training is to invest in 
people. It is a direct investment in each Mexican child, young 
person, woman, and man. It is the most profitable investment 
for Mexico's present and future. 
<H5>  Third: A Fiscal Policy for Investment </H5>
  Throughout my campaign, I have heard again and again strong 
concern about the tax policy. Tax policy should become a pillar 
for supporting and stimulating production and investment. We 
should put the Treasury at the service of taxpayers, taking care 
that arrogance and abuse do not hamper the efforts and 
initiatives of all. 
  Juridical security regarding taxes will receive priority 
treatment. For this reason, I hereby propose that the fiscal 
authority in charge of enforcing fiscal laws and collecting 
taxes be a decentralized, modern, and autonomous agency with 
officials trained for civil service. As a result, the fiscal 
administration will have increasingly better trained people who 
earn salaries in accordance with the work they perform, whose 
service to the public will be of high quality and who enforce 
fiscal laws impartially. 
  I will propose that audits be carried out as rapidly as 
possible and that at the end of all audits, the taxpayer receive 
a copy of the resolution, with which he can go to court to 
confirm or deny the legality of the fiscal authority's actions. 
I will propose strengthening the Federation's Fiscal Tribunal 
by giving it greater autonomy. 
  Regarding simplification of the administration, I will 
underline the need for the fiscal authority's functions to be 
those of a community servant and that, as a consequence, it 
should do its work with the utmost efficiency and the least 
possible irritation to citizens. 
  A very important measure of immediate benefits will be to 
let 
many more enterprises compute and pay their taxes four times a 
year instead of every month. This means that more than 80 
percent of the country's enterprises, particularly 
minienterprises, as well as small and medium enterprises, will 
benefit from this measure. In addition, we will simplify 
procedures to reduce their administrative burdens. 
  I will promote an aggressive reforms program to provide a 
tax 
framework that can be competitive at the international level. 
Tax rates are just as important as collection procedures. We 
will revise the fiscal incentive system by rewarding productive 
investment. I will promote a reform to increase and extend the 
benefit of immediate deduction of investment to small and medium 
enterprises located in the three large metropolitan areas and 
increase this benefit in the other areas where it is already in 
practice. 
  I will propose a new fiscal incentive system so enterprises 
can devote a greater amount of money to labor training, adopt 
new technologies, and invest in equipment to combat pollution. 
This will make us more competitive in the international market 
and help raise the standard of living of the people in general. 
  I will propose revising the operational mechanism of taxes 
on 
assets to alleviate the harmful effects that have been pointed 
out to me since the beginning of my campaign. First, and as an 
initial step, I will propose a 10-percent reduction of this tax 
to make this rate consistent with the lower corporate tax rate. 
I pledge to revise this rate and the tax application mechanism 
at the end of the first year of my government. Second, I will 
propose a four-year grace period for the payment of this tax by 
the new enterprises and assets. Third, I will propose that the 
enterprises that experienced a deficit in a specific fiscal year 
be exempted from the payment of this tax if they obtained a 
profit in any one of the three preceding years. 
  We cannot turn our backs on firms experiencing hardships 
when these firms are sources of progress for the country. 
  Regarding workers' personal income taxes, I will propose 
reforms to simplify calculations and make taxes proportionate 
and fair. Workers with low and medium incomes will pay 
proportionately less tax. 
  It should be noted that the best fiscal system, the fairest 
and most equitable, is one in which taxpayers meet their 
obligations. The measures I propose will contribute to creating 
a fiscal regime that is simple and accessible to most 
contributors. This will mean better compliance by each tax 
payer. 
  We shall reach agreements with local and state governments 
on 
new formulas to guarantee the direct flow of greater resources 
to municipalities. We will encourage the coordination of 
efforts with local and state governments to improve their own 
collection sources, without excessive taxes that inhibit 
regional development, but guarantee the quality of the services 
they provide. 
  With these initial reforms we will spend the first year 
examining other reforms to quickly establish a permanent regime 
that gives certitude and has mechanisms to avoid continuous 
modifications. 
<H5>  Fourth: Encouragement of Savings and Competitive Financing </H5>
for Growth 
  The financial system plays a fundamental role in collecting 
savings and its efficient channeling toward productive 
activities. For this reason we should continue actions that 
increase the financial system's competitiveness and efficiency, 
so that its users may have access to services and products with 
price conditions and opportunities comparable to other countries. 
  National producers claims on the comparative disadvantage 
they face is very fair. It is not acceptable that our small- 
and medium- sized entrepreneurs should face such high interest 
rates as the current ones. 
  These rates have two components. One corresponds to the 
macroeconomic surrounding and is determined by interest rates 
abroad, expected inflation rates, and the perception of the so 
called "country's risk." The other component is determined by 
the middleman's margin; in other words the difference between 
the cost of funds to middlemen and the rate at which they lend 
these funds. 
  By consolidating macroeconomic stability, we should reach 
single digit inflation, just as at the beginning of the year. 
Likewise, the congruence of the economic strategy that I 
propose today will serve to reduce the "risk factor," which in 
turn will encourage lower interest rates. 
  It is also essential that the middleman's margin be reduced. 
For this, we need to encourage greater competition through 
greater opening of the financial sector, both at home and 
abroad. We must also encourage greater deregulation to broaden 
the variety of financial products and ease access to more 
enterprises to debt and capital markets. It is imperative that 
national producers have access to internationally competitive 
interest rates. We will work tirelessly for this. 
  We admit that even in a scenario of stability, financial 
markets are volatile and on occasions short-term interest rates 
reach levels that our enterprises cannot support. This is why I 
shall encourage the creation of mechanisms of protection that 
will not allow normal interest rate hikes to directly affect 
long-term financing for businesses. In addition, development 
banking will extend the benefits of long-term funding to small 
and medium enterprises. 
  I intend to increase development bank resources and support 
mechanisms for small and medium businesses because they are 
vigorous employment generators. Likewise, I will seek 
development banking and new financial middlemen that have arisen 
following the sector's opening and deregulation and guide their 
activity toward these types of businesses. 
  The financial system faces two more challenges: rural 
financing and boosting popular savings. We must recognize that 
commercial banking has specialized in niches of apparently more 
profitable markets, without offering basic financial services to 
the various productive sectors, population levels, and 
geographic regions. 
  It is unacceptable that on the eve of the 21st century, 
1,600 
municipalities do not have formal savings and loans services. 
My strategy includes boosting financial institutions with local 
orientation, which channel development banking resources and 
encourage popular savings. 
  I intend strengthening credit unions and savings banks that 
provide basic financial services to communities. We will take 
advantage of development banking and, in particular, the 
National Savings Board, so that it becomes a regulatory 
institution for these middlemen. 
  Regarding rural sector financing, it is necessary to 
encourage new institutional and operational mechanisms for 
credit to reach the countryside opportunely and at a low cost. 
I will propose conditions so that credit unions can directly 
deduct development funds. We should encourage a culture of 
healthy banking practices, always making a distinction between 
support, subsidies, and credit. 
  On the other hand, credit is an essential factor for 
encouraging the well-being of the population. It also 
represents a very dynamic activity and is a great job generator. 
  Today, we have a great housing deficit. Population growth 
and natural replacement call for building approximately 700,000 
houses every year. That is why during the government I intend 
to lead, I will especially stress housing development programs. 
In particular, I will encourage necessary reforms to create a 
secondary mortgage loan market to channel a greater volume of 
resources to this activity. I also propose to induce a 
considerable amount of SAR [Retirement Savings System] resources 
in support of social interest housing. 
<H5>  Fifth: Greater Deregulation To Encourage Employment </H5>
  Excessive regulation significantly affects productivity, 
competitiveness, and enterprise profitability. Consequently it 
inhibits investment and the possibility of generating well-paid 
jobs. The country cannot grow when producers support a great 
load derived from obsolete regulations and when regulations 
limit or eliminate the viability not only of enterprises but 
whole sectors of the economy. 
  For that reason, we will make a major effort to properly 
regulate the needs of an economy that seek greater growth and 
equity. Deregulation will be extended to all sectors of economic 
activity, lowering barriers to the entry of new participants, 
eliminating exclusive advantages, and establishing clear rules 
to be universally implemented. The result will be lower costs 
for companies and more jobs for our workers. 
  Our deregulation efforts must reach all of the country's 
spheres. Within the framework of our federal pact, I propose to 
establish coordination mechanisms with the state governments and 
municipalities. That is particularly important in matters, such 
as transportation and the use of soil, which may generate 
bottlenecks in creating jobs. Through these efforts, we will 
open new opportunities for small- and medium-scale businessmen 
in the states and the Federal District who are the ones most 
hurt by obsolete and often arbitrary regulations. 
  On the matter of concessions and public permits, we will 
promote legal reforms so that they be granted at all times based 
on the criteria of efficiency, eliminating discretionary 
excesses. 
  We admit companies, small and medium companies in 
particular, are bearing an excessive administrative burden. We 
also admit that the framework of regulations frequently favor 
corrupt practices. Mexico, at the end of this century, cannot 
have its progress hampered by a dense and sometimes irrational 
regulation or by redundant and useless administrative procedures. 
  The economy cannot continue to tolerate, for instance, 
Federal District businessmen having to go through over 100 steps 
at government entities in order to set up their businesses. All 
of this is hurting the opportunities of the district's 
residents. The policy of deregulation will be accompanied by a 
profound administrative streamlining and overhauling of 
procedures at all levels of government. 
  To keep some companies from obtaining illicit advantages 
through monopolistic practices, we will promote the policy of 
competition. The efficiency the country sorely needs to create, 
productive jobs, can only be achieved through a process of 
vigorous competition. It is not acceptable that the absence of 
competition should mean advantages, privileges, and 
extraordinary revenues for a few. Competition generates more 
jobs and a more equitable distribution of income. 
  It must be made very clear that the absence of clear and 
uniform rules for all, favoritism or abuses by some officials, 
and monopolistic revenues are not part of the modern economy we 
want to build. On the contrary, they obstruct it with 
privileges and corruption. My economic policy will be based on 
a fair treatment for all. We are going to work together for a 
participative economy. That is my commitment. 
  To ensure the effective progress of these measures, we will 
take advantage of the experience gained in social consensus for 
the macroeconomy. We will have to enter into a phase in which 
precise pacts at the microeconomic level are signed, placing the 
emphasis on deregulation. We will establish follow-up 
committees to meet periodically to monitor advances. We will do 
it in every municipality, region, and state where warranted. 
<H5>  Sixth: Intermediary Raw Materials and Infrastructure for </H5>
Competitiveness 
  We must eliminate all factors that diminish our producers' 
capacity to compete and create jobs. For that reason, one of 
the key elements of my economic policy proposal is to ensure 
national producers have access to raw materials, under 
conditions of quality and prices similar to those of their 
competitors abroad. 
  We want greater competition, but it must take place under 
just conditions for all. By equating the conditions for 
supplying strategic raw materials and infrastructure with those 
of our chief competitor countries, we will raise the profits of 
our country's companies, while promoting the creation of jobs we 
require. We will center our efforts on energy raw materials, 
transportation, and telecommunications. 
  With strict adherence to the existing constitutional 
framework, I propose introducing profound changes within state 
enterprises in the energy sectors. On the matter of 
electricity, we will take advantage of the new options the legal 
framework now offers to direct public investment toward 
strengthening and improving transmission and distribution and to 
encourage private participation in generating electricity. That 
way, local producers will have major savings either because the 
use of electricity will be cheaper or because improved quality 
will make it unnecessary to have additional equipment to guard 
against excessive flaws in the flow of electricity. 
  Maintaining state ownership and direct control over the 
hydrocarbons extracted from the national territory constitutes a 
political commitment clearly outlined in our Constitution. I am 
endorsing it with conviction and Mexican pride. Oil belongs to 
Mexicans and will continue belonging to Mexicans. 
  In order for Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] to further contribute 
to growth and the creation of productive jobs, I am proposing 
reinforcing its capacity to provide strategic solutions and 
operational efficiency. 
  We must concentrate Pemex's efforts on exploration and 
extraction, but we must also ensure we have a supply of 
industrial fuels, including natural gas, that is prompt, 
reliable, at competitive prices, and in the amounts required by 
national producers. 
  This is the only way Pemex will be able to rationally 
manage a nonrenewable state resource and supply the national 
plant with the inputs it requires for growth. 
  Investing in the transportation infrastructure is 
fundamental 
for reducing costs and increasing jobs through a broader 
economic network that enables companies to access regional and 
foreign markets; consequently, I propose allocating more budget 
resources to promote road maintenance and prevent the wear on 
transportation equipment and reduce dates for delivery. 
  In addition, the strategy I am recommending will encourage 
greater participation by private companies in construction and 
operations in order to advance in the enlargement of the road 
network, within a framework of competition that will lead to 
more competitive tolls and fees. Mexico has only begun to 
overcome the predicament, ignored for decades, of constructing 
modern roads. We must step up the pace. We cannot have new 
roads that are not used, nor can we have old roads that are 
overused. 
  As part of my proposal to modernize transportation, we will 
begin an in-depth transformation of the railroad infrastructure. 
This transformation is a serious task modern Mexico must 
undertake to enhance our economic performance. 
  Restructuring the railroads is necessary for the 
modernization of domestic trade. It is also indispensable for 
deregulating our ports, which will allow an increase in 
productivity, thus promoting a healthy competition among ports. 
This competition will reduce the costs of imported intermediate 
inputs by our producers and will boost competitiveness among 
exports. 
  In addition to supporting the process for the generation of 
jobs, restructuring railroads will be a lever for triggering the 
development of less-developed areas in the country. 
  My proposal to support domestic producers also includes a 
rapid modernization of telecommunications, adapting regulations 
to technological changes. We will encourage vigorous 
competition in this sector, resulting in a higher quality 
service, reduced costs, and development in pace with the 
country's needs. Improved telecommunications are not only 
necessary for attracting additional investment in an 
increasingly interdependent world, we must also have better 
informed citizens who can participate in the strengthening of 
our democracy. 
<H5>  Seventh: Technological Modernization for Greater Productivity </H5>
  In the medium term, technological modernization is the main 
source of growth. Mexico must reach the 21st century by 
combining its exports of traditional manufactured good with a 
greater proportion of technology intensive products. This 
combination constitutes one of the bases for increasing workers' 
incomes. 
  Technological modernization is a long process that entails 
risks and intense skilled labor. We will create novel plans to 
reduce investment risks in the purchase, adoption, and creation 
of new technologies such as fiscal incentives and plans of 
shared-risk with development banks. We will promote new forms 
of association among companies so that they may cooperate in 
research and developmental projects. We will equitably provide 
incentives, without discriminating among sectors or companies. 
  Our industrial policy will focus on creating the fiscal, 
credit, and regulatory conditions and incentives for 
technological modernization so as to enable all to participate 
under fair and equal conditions in economic activity. We must 
avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, when support to 
special sectors became counterproductive, because instead of 
boosting efforts to raise productivity, they encouraged the 
concentration of income. 
<H5>  Eighth: Fair Competition From Overseas </H5>
  When we speak of foreign trade, we generally think about the 
competition involved, not considering the opportunities it 
offers. Foreign trade is necessary in order to produce more and 
progress. Through trade, we can specialize in manufacturing 
better those items we produce. 
  To fully take advantage of this potential, we must advance 
further by promoting our exports. We plan to strengthen those 
efforts aimed at tearing down the administrative and legal 
obstacles our goods are confronting in international markets. 
We intend to bolster the framework of the foreign trade 
information centers, advisory, and technical training so as to 
provide better support to manufacturers. We intend to buttress 
Mexico's trade offices overseas so as to identify new markets 
and greater business opportunities. We intend to stress 
financing opportunities to encourage exports through more 
effective and active guarantees, as well as provide a larger 
number of financing intermediaries available to this sector. 
  Regarding imports, we will promote fair competition. We 
will vigorously enforce Mexican legislation in those cases in 
which the Mexican producer is the object of the disloyal 
practices of international commerce. I will guarantee to all 
Mexican producers that compensatory taxes will be implemented. 
I will take the necessary measures to prevent the triangulation 
of goods coming from countries not included in the preferential 
treatment regime. I will complement them by conducting a 
profound overhauling of the country's customs operations. 
  Concurrently, it is necessary to generate new commercial 
ties 
so as to obtain preferential access to the chief markets of the 
world and diversify our exports. I will continue to promote 
international accords to obtain conditions that guarantee 
fairness with our foreign competitors. 
  In those cases where there is no commercial reciprocity, we 
will act with the rigor the defense of our producers demands so 
they are not hurt by disloyal and unfair competition. 
<H5>  Ninth: Development of Mexico's Countryside </H5>
  In past years, the bases for rural development were 
established. The amendments to Article 27 of the Constitution 
and its laws and regulations strengthen and guarantee the 
existence of ejidos, communities, and small landholding and 
expressly banned large landholdings. We now have a legal 
framework that guarantees the patrimony of the men and women 
from rural areas and promotes the capitalization of the 
countryside. I pledge to consolidate and improve Procampo 
[Program of Direct Support to the Countryside] and promote 
conditions for fair and loyal competition with the rest of the 
world. Despite the advances, much remains to be done. 
Productivity in rural areas is four times smaller than in all 
other economic activities today. I will decisively support 
agricultural and livestock production, because I firmly believe 
in the potential of Mexico's countryside. 
  We will give priority to the development of the 
infrastructure, primarily to small-scale and medium-scale 
irrigation, drainage, the leveling of soils, rural roads, and 
erosion control projects. Infrastructure projects expand the 
range of crops the farmer may plant, make the countryside 
profitable, facilitate access to loans, favor the use of modern 
products, and permanently increase productivity. They also 
create more jobs and ease the migratory pressures on the urban 
jobs market. 
  Farmers have repeatedly demanded the abolishment of 
excessive 
intermediaries. I propose modernizing marketing systems to 
facilitate direct transactions between farmers and wholesalers, 
and I will complement this effort with investment in the 
marketing infrastructure. Similarly, we will promote the 
organization of farmers to reinforce their productive capability. 
  I will combat bureaucracy and centralization through a 
institutional reform of the organizations that handle the rural 
sector so that farmers' demands are taken care of in their place 
of origin. States and municipalities, with the support of the 
federation, will be the ones to meet the demands of rural 
society. 
<H5>  Tenth: For a Growth Respectful of the Environment </H5>
  Natural resources and the environment constitute one of the 
fundamental assets of the economic development of the whole 
country. To harm them gravely hurts, at times irreversibly, the 
people's possibility of welfare. 
  To protect our environment, I will promote economic and 
fiscal incentives. I also pledge to make ecological regulations 
clear, with terms that assure investment and entail an adequate 
cost for society. In addition, procedures must also be 
streamlined, without hurting conservation. 
  We will seek to make mechanisms for monitoring and 
enforcement simpler, more open and effective to facilitate 
compliance with legal provisions. 
  Likewise, it is essential to continue ecology education 
efforts and to encourage society's participation in the 
development, evaluation, and supervision of policies. 
<H5>  Eleventh: Ladies and gentlemen and all friends: </H5>
  These are the ten main points of the Economic Reactivation 
and Sustained Growth strategy that I propose today. 
  We will begin a new stage of development in Mexico with 
these 
ten points. Starting with advances in stabilization and 
structural changes, and on the basis of what has already been 
achieved, we will boost a strategy that encourages production, 
employment, and remuneration. 
  Conditions are now right to boost our country's growth. My 
proposal takes advantage of what has already been done to 
encourage economic activity, basing it on broad social 
participation with clear rules and fair treatment. To implement 
the proposal we shall consolidate the appropriate government 
support so that society's initiatives become viable projects. 
  It is essential that a legal framework exist to effectively 
protect people, both physically as well as morally. Economic 
growth, the same as social development, is not possible without 
legal security. It is especially necessary to guarantee 
contractual obligations and property rights. Legal security on 
legitimate property rights of all social groups, is an essential 
condition for growth. 
  I am convinced that we cannot postpone the decentralization 
of duties, which today the federal government conducts to 
address the demands and raise the standard of living of Mexican 
families. 
  Mexico must begin the 21st century with a renewed 
federalism, 
a fuller federalism, founded on strengthening the municipality, 
nurtured by the vigor of the states, and backed by a genuine 
division of government branches, and a government program close 
to citizens and responsible to them. 
  It is not enough to propose a simple tax reform. We need to 
redesign the entire system to achieve a new federalism, which is 
essential for overall economic growth in all areas. 
  We should transfer to municipalities and states the power, 
authority, effective means, and especially resources, which can 
then be turned into decisionmaking power and capacity. This is 
my pledge. 
  It is imperative that we recover the road to growth right 
from the next administration's first year. The strategies I 
proposed today guarantee this. Bolstering public and private 
investment will allow the 1995 GNP to grow to at least twice the 
rate of the population growth. 
  At the same time, by consolidating support for the export 
sector we can forecast vigorous growth through greater 
deregulation, new incentives, simplified taxes, and a favorable 
international market climate. We will create during the next 
six-year period the million jobs a year the population demands, 
and we will do this with greater investment and increased 
exports . 
  Today, I reiterate that our economic future demands special 
incentives for micro-, small-, and medium-sized businesses. 
These already generate 60 percent of the country's productive 
jobs and we should encourage their multiplication and expansion 
to become a dynamic boost for economic growth. This is why I 
proposed before the country's small businessmen a specific 
program to encourage their participation in the Mexican economy. 
  Our experience, and the experiences of other nations who 
have implemented successful growth strategies, clearly show that 
there is no miraculous recipe; there are no spectacular measures 
that lead to development overnight. The formula to accomplish 
sustained growth is based on ensuring that the daily endeavors 
of all Mexicans be more productive. If we move in the right 
direction, spectacular results will be everyday occurrences at 
factories, and among peasants, workers, technicians, executives, 
and employees. 
  During this political campaign, others have been making 
demagogic proposals to garner more votes, knowing quite well 
that their proposals are unrealistic. This is not the case with 
the PRI. 
  As my party's candidate, I propose an economic strategy of 
production and growth encouragement, based on realistic and 
reliable ground rules. This reactivation and growth strategy 
can be financed properly with the savings from the efforts of 
society and with revenues from economic growth. My proposal is 
closely related to fiscal accountability and economic stability. 
  This strategy includes the apprehensions, needs, and 
proposals of every social group, and it will be further enriched 
with the participation of all of you. I invite you all to do 
your share, and improve this strategy with your knowledge and 
your experiences. This proposal is open to every evaluation, and 
additional recommendations by the organizations represented 
here. I invite you all so that together we may transform this 
proposal into a shared government program. This proposal will 
benefit us all. This proposal will benefit Mexico. 
  The government efforts I plan to lead will be aimed at 
ensuring that the daily needs of all households are met by 
creating more employment and better wages. Gone are the days 
when state initiative meant indiscriminate participation in all 
productive activities. Today, the state must be society's 
partner in promoting economic growth. 
  We Mexicans do not want to remain indecisive in a world that 
is rapidly changing and which no longer permits any wavering or 
steps backward. We Mexicans do not accept brazen criticism that 
proposes nothing. We are not going to build the Mexico of the 
future with proposals that only destroy what we have 
accomplished. 
  We Mexicans do not accept proposals that entail building a 
hollow Mexico that does not acknowledge our history, our 
workers' accomplishments, as well as the predominant role of 
women in our society. 
  We Mexicans do not accept the pessimism of those who believe 
that our country is about to fall into a crisis, uncertainty, 
and violence. We Mexicans do not accept any paralyzing 
skepticism by those who would rather cross their arms instead of 
facing the challenges that lie ahead. 
  I view the future with optimism. Mexico has problems which 
we clearly and honestly acknowledge as a starting point to solve 
them. Additionally, with each campaign day, it is acknowledged 
more and more that the PRI is the party that offers the best 
platform, the best proposals, and the best men and women to 
implement them. 
  Today, more than ever, Mexico seeks unity. Today, more than 
ever, Mexico looks toward the future with optimism, 
steadfastness, and conviction. Today, more than ever, we are 
facing a clear path that will lead to growth and wellbeing. 
  Let us all together build a Mexico of sovereignty and 
development, development and welfare, welfare and justice. Let 
us all build a prosperous Mexico which today is practically 
within our grasp. Let us all build a Mexico our children 
deserve. Let us do it with everyone's participation and 
commitment. 
  Today, before you, I ratify this. That is my commitment, and 
I intend to fulfill it. Viva Mexico!

  [Excerpts] During a regular session of the Social 
Development Coordinating Council (CCDS) on 7 June, President 
Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated that the government already is 
attending to practically all social problems in rural 
settlements in San Pedro and Canindeyu Departments. 
  Accompanied by regional and church authorities, the head of 
state visited several rural settlements in northern Paraguay on 
5 June for first-hand knowledge of the most pressing problems 
confronting the region's farmers. 
  It was precisely there that several peasants organizations 
staged protest rallies and blocked highways to demand better 
prices for their produce, greater financial and technical 
assistance from the government, and the implementation of 
education and health care programs. 
  The president said military personnel and Agrarian Reform 
Institute officials surveyed several plots of land in rural 
areas of several colonies located in that region. This will 
contribute to expediting steps to grant property deeds to 
farmers, an essential requirement to ask for agricultural 
credits. [passage omitted] 
  During the CCDS session, Interior Minister Carlos Podesta 
said the government already has granted some 2,000 property 
deeds in several colonies so far. 
  He added that a national survey on rural needs conducted by 
the departmental councils of each governorship in the country's 
17 departments and 214 districts will be submitted at the next 
CCDS meeting. This survey will serve as input for the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to put together a project 
devised by Wasmosy--the Paraguayan Program on Social 
Investment--that seeks to obtain a $100 million loan for rural 
development projects.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has 
categorically denied our country is volunteering to become a 
camp for Haitian refugees. The official explained the small 
group of Haitians who qualify as political refugees will stay 
temporarily in the country. In addition, he described as 
exaggerated the remarks by members of the opposition who said 
the country is experiencing a crisis situation and already has a 
needy alien population. The foreign minister finds this is an 
exaggeration, oh well. Burelli Rivas also said Venezuela will 
support UN agreements on the mission that will be operating in 
Haiti but explained the solution to the problems of that 
Caribbean nation depends not only on the restoration of 
democracy, but also on the cooperation of neighboring countries 
to improve the living conditions of Haitians, who otherwise will 
emigrate. In the opinion of Deputy Geman Monzon, chairman of the 
Foreign Policy Committee, our country lacks the necessary 
conditions to receive Haitian refugees.

<F P=106> [Article by Oscar Raul Cardoso: "Will the United States </F>
Invade Haiti?" -- copyrighted by CLARIN] 
  [Text] Long before the era of CNN, French author Victor 
Hugo stated in the 19th century that one can prevent an invasion 
by foreign armies but one cannot prevent an invasion of ideas. 
Some 21 months after ousting the first legally elected 
president in Haitian history, a group of military and civilians 
who are accustomed to prospering at the expense of those who 
endure misery and suffering is again jeopardizing the 
hemispheric security system by trying to disprove Victor Hugo's 
statement. 
  An eventual U.S. military invasion, supported by a 
multinational force seeking to establish democracy, is a clear 
possibility in the not-so-distant-future. Bill Clinton has 
publicly admitted the viability of such a possibility. It has 
the unmistakable smell of a prophecy about to come true. 
  The damage caused to the hemispheric system by similar 
actions undertaken in previous decades -- like in Grenada and 
Panama -- has yet to be assessed. Assessments were in many 
cases postponed by the flood of innumerable fantasies that 
drowned international relations at the end of the Cold War. 
  The main problem is that Clinton invariably contradicts 
himself, particularly on foreign policy matters. At this stage 
of his administration, his words have a hollow sound. The 
Serbs, for example, have every reason to pay no attention when 
the Clinton administration feels the need to impress them -- the 
Serbs in particular, but even more so the rest of the World -- 
by hardening its military discourse. 
  An editorial published a few months ago in one of the 
intellectual mouthpieces of that strange phenomenon that is 
"Clintonism" -- THE NEW REPUBLIC magazine -- caused 
understandable moral anguish. It stated that the United States 
is willing to fight commercial wars but not genocidal wars. 
  Perhaps the Haitian dictatorship believes it might now avoid 
a foreign military landing on the island with the same 
uninterrupted success that successive generations of dominant 
classes have enjoyed in tenaciously blocking such universal 
ideals as human dignity, freedom, and social well-being since 
the slave uprising in 1804 which resulted in Haitian 
independence. 
  History does not reject the possibility of impunity. The 
regime -- in which General Raoul Cedras is the master puppeteer 
and the elderly lawyer Emile Jonassaint is the puppet wearing 
the presidential sash that sways in compliance with Cedras' 
wishes -- may succeed in its nefarious actions. 
  Ever since ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide was 
forced into exile, the international community has gone hoarse 
demanding the reinstatement of the previous status quo. At the 
expense of others, the Haitian regime has endured (and continues 
to endure) successive embargoes; humanitarian organizations 
state that two out of three Haitian children suffer 
malnutrition. Moreover, it made a complete mockery of a 
sensible agreement -- the Isla del Gobernador negotiated by 
Argentina's Dante Caputo -- which was originally accepted and 
which would have avoided global ridicule for Haiti. 
  Haiti poses a heavy load on the U.S. conscience. The drama 
of Haitians drowning at sea trying to reach the U.S. coast and 
the reality of the horror of another immigration wave -- with 
its corresponding hunger, willingness to take low-wage jobs, and 
empty stomachs -- is a controversial issue in U.S. public 
opinion. 
  Clinton, who seems to have difficulty in distinguishing good 
from bad, in this case has built around himself and his 
administration a cobweb of contradictory positions. 
  Although the invasion would be the exclusive responsibility 
of the "benefactor power," other countries of the Americas would 
be compelled to contribute in the second stage of this exercise 
of exporting democracy. With the almost notorious exception of 
Argentina, no other Latin American country seems convinced of 
the benefits of such an adventure, which is ultimately aimed 
more at resolving Clinton's problem than at rescuing tormented 
Haitians. 
  The Foreign Ministry says the Argentine Government has 
established the prerequisite that at least one other Latin 
American country must approve and cooperate in this exercise. 
This, however, seems to be a mere formal position because the 
Argentine Government is the only Latin American government that 
has not objected to this idea. Official sources have asserted 
that Caputo -- the official OAS negotiator of the Haitian crisis 
-- is one of the channels through which they coordinate the 
projects that may be implemented in no more than 30 days. 
Another version states that the mediator believes only threats 
will suffice, while Caputo has already notified Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella that he will resign if the threat materializes. 
  Argentina has very little to give and even less to gain from 
this operation. It would be absurd to analyze the situation 
without considering Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Grenada, 
occupied by Ronald Reagan's men, has few reasons to thank the 
United States for the operation; while Panama -- without Manuel 
Noriega -- continues to be a haven for the drug traffickers and 
money launderers the invasion sought to eliminate. 
  In an effort to manage the numerous conflicts he inherited, 
Clinton seems to have nothing better to do than to act like Bush 
and resort to the same vision of the world he defeated in the 
ballot boxes almost two years ago. 
  All this is quite shocking because he seems to be mounting 
Bush's horse from the wrong side of the saddle. On 1 June THE 
NEW YORK TIMES published an article by Brent Scowcroft, a 
security adviser during the Bush administration, warning of the 
obvious risks that such an invasion entails and issuing a 
reminder that the United States occupied Haiti between 1914 and 
1933. Scowcroft writes: "When we arrived there we found no 
trace of democracy. When we left, we did not leave any trace of 
it either."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Patents Law"] </F>
  [Text] The Uruguay Round of GATT talks agreement signed by 
111 nations, including Argentina, will make it easier to modify 
our country's patents law, an issue confronting strong interests 
and on which there are notorious international pressures. 
  It is now certain that pharmaceutical patents, which 
currently are not recognized in our legislation, will be 
regulated by law in the future. What is being discussed at this 
time is the extent of adaptation periods and the way to exploit 
patents. 
  The long-lasting argument on the issue has acquired 
international importance in the past few years. The boom in 
science and technology, the huge amounts used in research and 
invention -- particularly in developed nations, and the size of 
the pharmaceutical market have brought the issue to the fore on 
nations' negotiating agenda. 
  One after another, all developed nations have recognized 
this 
right and joined other nations in their demand for recognition 
from developing nations, which, in general, have tried to 
maintain permissive policies allowing local companies -- even 
though this is not the purpose -- to go without paying 
intellectual rights on inventions and, more generically, 
everything included under the definition of intellectual 
property rights. 
  In our country, the central issue is medicinal patents on 
formulas and fabrication procedures, which often are used 
without paying royalties. Sometimes the violation involves local 
production, other times it derives from the importation of 
medicines from nations that do not recognize those rights, even 
though this market has become narrower and narrower because of 
the increasing number of countries that recognize patents rights 
in their legislation. 
  The Uruguay Round of GATT talks not only commits all parties 
to recognize patents rights, but also establishes a 20-year 
period for exploitation starting from the date the application 
is presented. The study of the case, however, can last several 
years. The agreement also defines the general basis for 
exploitation in case the owner does not do it on his own. Among 
other things it establishes that developing nations will have 10 
years to fully adapt and comply. 
  The GATT agreement must be ratified by the legislatures of 
at 
least 33 nations before it becomes effective, including the U.S. 
and Argentine Congresses. It is reasonable, however, to take 
GATT dispositions as the future international rule. 
  What we are discussing today then is not the legitimacy of 
patents but the terms for recognition, which constitutes 
important progress. The draft bill the executive branch sent to 
Congress three years ago recognizes patents in accordance with 
the GATT agreement, although proposing firmer terms for 
negotiating between parties and adaptation periods that are 
closer to U.S. Government goals. 
  In Washington, meanwhile, the period for conclusion of an 
administrative investigation that could derive from the 
application of compensatory rights on Argentine exports for 
damage against U.S. patent owners, which could be for some $110 
million annually, is running out. 
  The problem now is limited to negotiations between the 
Argentine and U.S. Governments and between the national 
executive and legislative branches. The most convenient and 
reasonable thing, considering the ironing out of difficulties 
carried out by GATT, is to try approving an agreement on pending 
issues quickly. 
  Formally, Argentina does not have any reason to approve 
legislation going beyond what has been agreed on at GATT. But 
there is a reality that must be recognized: the need to insert 
the country into the world community. Here the recognition of 
intellectual property rights is a rule of good partnership. The 
United States, in turn, should take into account that the 
implementation of commercial sanctions cannot exceed what is 
established by GATT, and the new World Trade Organization has 
the authority to mediate between conflicting parties.

<F P=106> [Article from Gilberto Scofield Junior's "Economic Report" </F>
column] 
  [Text] The governments of Uruguay and Paraguay have set 
their eyes on free trade zones in Brazil (in Manaus) and 
Argentina (in Tierra del Fuego, near the Beagle Canal), which 
are the latest difficulty for a consolidated implementation of 
the Common Market of the South [Mercosur]. Paraguayan and 
Uruguayan diplomats have made it clear: They do not agree to 
free trade zones inside Mercosur unless their countries can also 
establish theirs. Their fear makes sense. After all, areas with 
fiscal privileges that can send products to the giant common 
market at a low cost are a threat to any industrial park. 
  "The countries already have reached an accord on the 
export-processing zones, but negotiations on free trade zones 
continue," said Antonio Sergio Martins, secretary for industrial 
policy in the Industry, Commerce and Tourism Ministry. The 
problem is of a geo-economic nature. The Manaus and Tierra del 
Fuego free trade zones were established as a strategy to develop 
remote regions in Brazil and Argentina. These zones are nearly 
3,000 km from the two large countries' consumption centers. 
Uruguay and Paraguay are very small countries. Even if the free 
trade zones are established far from these two countries' 
capitals, they will not be more than 400 km from the consumption 
centers and very near southern Brazil and northern Argentina. 
  Instead of putting an end to the existing free trade zones, 
the solution may be to reduce the fiscal benefits currently in 
force in Manaus and Tierra del Fuego. The curious thing, 
however, is that the Brazilian Congress recently renewed the 
paternalistic benefits granted to the Manaus Free Trade Zone for 
a few more years. 
  Meanwhile, Mercosur goes into force on 1 January 1995.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Relations 
Ministry today said that protecting the inviolability of 
embassies headquartered in Cuba is an obligation of the island's 
government, in compliance with the provisions of the Vienna 
Convention. 
  This is the explanation that the Ministry gave for 
reinforcing security around diplomatic missions in this capital 
in the wake of the incident provoked by the forceful entrance of 
a group of persons into the residence of the Belgian ambassador. 
  In statements for domestic and foreign media, Ministry 
spokesman Miguel Alfonso said that Cuba and Belgium continue to 
reject the permanence of such persons in the building and are 
holding talks to enforce commonly accepted principles. 
  As part of such contacts, the Belgian Embassy handed to 
Cuban 
authorities an official list of the residence's occupants, 121 
men, women, and children. 
  The Cuban Government recognizes the inviolability of the 
Belgian facilities and will abstain from taking any measure that 
could affect it although the occupants entered through violence, 
Alfonso pointed out. 
  They also agreed on the impossibility of accepting the use 
of 
force to avoid established regular procedures to leave the 
country, a position that Cuba has already reaffirmed. 
  The Foreign Ministry offered medical services to the 
Belgians, even to the occupants, as well as food, which is 
already being supplied with the help of other European embassies. 
  Alfonso noted that reprisals would not be taken against 
those 
who leave the residency nor would any obstacle be placed in 
their efforts to depart Cuba through the normal procedures. 
Nevertheless, if any of them have cases pending in Cuban 
courts, this would be taken into account. 
  When referring to other illegalities detected, he pointed 
out 
the distribution of political statements to the international 
media, after their elaboration inside the building, even though 
only authorized personnel can enter and exit the site. 
  To conclude, Alfonso said that no dramatic developments are 
foreseen in the Belgium residency situation in the coming hours.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry confirmed that two Canadian citizens will stand trial 
in Cuba for participating in a group of people's attempt to 
illegally leave the country, which ended in two tragic deaths. 
  Michael Benditti and Robert Shymko arrived in Havana on a 
boat from Florida and stopped over at the "Marina Hemingway" 
naval base, claiming that they planned to continue their trip to 
Varadero Beach, 140 km from Havana. 
  Nevertheless, according to Foreign Ministry Spokesman Miguel 
Alfonso, the Canadians in fact traveled to Guanabo Beach, 
approximately 25 km from the capital, to facilitate the illegal 
departure from the country of eight people which, apparently, 
had been previously agreed upon. 
  The group's haste to leave prompted an accident on the beach 
which claimed the lives of two swimmers and caused serious 
injuries to another, he added. 
  Consequently, it has been officially announced that the two 
Canadians have been arrested and will be subjected to legal 
procedures established for such cases. 
  The spokesman explained that the foreigners have already 
been 
visited by officials from the Canadian Consulate in Cuba and 
that legal procedures against them are following their normal 
course.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, </F>
published in PRISMA DE CUBA Y LAS AMERICAS, a PRENSA LATINA 
publication: "Latin America: S.O.S. for Ibero-American Summits"] 
  [Text] For the fourth time, and without "anyone's" 
permission, the heads of state and government of Latin America, 
Spain, and Portugal will sit down at the same table -- this time 
in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia -- to take new steps to bring 
together countries which, for plenty of historical, cultural, or 
ideological reasons, should always be united. 
  A glance back at the three previous summits makes it 
possible 
for us to see that the Ibero-American nations have focused their 
discussions on various subjects usually recommended by the host 
country. Guadalajara (Mexico, 1991) marked a very special 
occasion because, for the first time, all of the Iberian-origin 
countries on the American continent were convened under the 
banner of joint support for the unity and integration of our 
peoples and to lay the forum's fundamental groundwork on topics 
such as plurality, diversity, and the people's right to 
peacefully create institutions and the best political system 
possible. 
  Certainly, the idea of this meeting had been conceived 
within 
the framework of the festivities organized by Spain in 1992 to 
commemorate the 500th anniversary of the "discovery" of America. 
Mexico, however, had the good idea of convening the first such 
meeting in the region -- a move that guaranteed continuity and 
the fulfillment of unity and integration at a time when NAFTA 
caused concern among some people about Mexico's future role in 
Latin America. 
  Madrid (1992), in the already mentioned context of its 
festivities, underlined the contribution and implementation of 
cultural and educational cooperation projects. It was in 
Salvador de Bahia last year, however, where for the first time 
the Ibero-American Summit discussed development with a social 
emphasis, and it did so at a time when Brazil was proposing in 
the United Nations an "agenda for development." 
  On focusing its attention on "economics, integration, and 
commerce" in June, Cartagena de Indias seeks to give the forum a 
new dimension beyond common history, language, and culture. The 
meeting seeks to turn the association of peoples into an 
economic opportunity for all. In this context, Cuba has always 
longed for a united Latin America -- a Latin America of which 
Bolivar and Marti had dreamed -- and integration as a function 
of the most precious interests of our peoples. 
  Great are the challenges and efforts found on this difficult 
yet vital path. Cuba has pointed these out more than once. To 
achieve the desired regional dimension, it is necessary to bring 
together all ongoing regional processes. At the same time, we 
must defend our joint positions on political, economic, and 
social matters of interest, particularly those related to 
regional integration and incorporation, from a point of 
fairness, of Latin America and the Caribbean into international 
relations. 
  It is also essential to give this process a broader scope 
and 
greater depth through the gradual integration of the productive 
and service sectors, but without playing down the importance of 
scientific, technological, health, and educational cooperation 
as vital instruments of an irreversible and permanent 
integration process. This process, conceived as a means to 
improve the welfare of our peoples through the integration of 
the social sector and actions that give it a human dimension, 
would be the adequate framework for Cuba to put at the service 
of regional cooperation its progress and experience in the field 
of social development for the solution of collective problems 
that, above ideologies, require urgent measures. 
  Of continual concern for the Cuban delegations attending the 
three previous summits have been both the prevailing enthusiasm 
for neoliberalism and the enormous optimism in terms of its 
results. On each occasion, Cuba has made known that it 
respects, but does not share, these viewpoints, because they do 
not favor the development of our peoples or stimulate a revision 
of dependency as a function of the interests of the current 
centers of power. For this reason, the unanimous recognition, 
even by the Inter-American meeting, of the extreme poverty and 
social imbalance situation experienced by most of the countries 
south of the Rio Grande is clear proof of neoliberalism's 
failure in the region. 
  Cuba will attend the Cartagena de Indias summit with these 
ideas in mind and with the purpose of contributing to the 
strength of this important forum at a time when the hemisphere 
summit convened by the United States undermines the permanence 
of Ibero-American summits as a mechanism for a concerted effort. 
<H5>  False Agenda </H5>
  The new U.S. Democratic administration is trying to exploit 
the success attained with the approval of NAFTA with the 
intention of casting a positive image of its policy throughout 
the continent and recovering lost ground. This explains the 
lack of definition regarding the topics to be discussed in the 
meeting. 
  By definition, Cuba cannot oppose this convocation, because 
there are indeed numerous problems to be discussed regarding 
relations between the United States and Latin America. This is 
not a bad idea, provided the meeting serves to discuss 
undeniable existing disagreements. If we are to be honest, 
Latin America and the Caribbean know they cannot have great 
expectations for the possible results of the meeting. Past 
Washington-convened meetings have proven to result in much ado 
about nothing. 
  The attempts to once again exclude Cuba show a U.S. policy 
of 
discrimination against our country, and they run against 
international trends in which collective wisdom advises against 
making contrived exclusions. Such exclusions have not been made 
in the meetings under the Ibero-American framework, the Security 
and Cooperation Conference in Europe, or the Asian-Pacific 
summit. 
  The Hemispheric Summit should not be used as a tool of 
specific U.S. interests but, rather, as a tool of the interests 
of all participating countries. For this reason, it would be 
good for the summit's date, venue, agenda, and participants to 
be decided by mutual agreement and not by a unilateral dictate 
from Washington. What merit can Miami claim for hosting a 
meeting of the nations of the continent, other than the city's 
well-known record of violence; the lack of freedom of expression 
imposed by the intransigence and terrorism of the Cuban-American 
extreme rightists; and, as a bad joke, the fact that it serves 
as the main organizational center for the continent's drug 
traffickers? 
  The people of the region should concentrate their efforts in 
promoting an agenda to discuss the true problems of 
Inter-American relations to prevent any one country on the 
continent from being excluded, to keep alive the Ibero-American 
movement, and to keep Washington from once again making our 
decisions for us.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Frank Gonzalez: "Fourth </F>
Ibero-American Summit: Consultation Mechanism Will Have To Prove 
Its Strength"] 
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia [no date as received] 
-- While looking toward integration and remaining committed to 
making concerted efforts to survive in the new international 
scene, the Ibero-American presidents are scheduled to hold their 
fourth summit this month in this Colombian Caribbean city. 
  The meeting, scheduled to be held on 14 and 15 June, will be 
attended by 23 heads of state or government in Latin America, 
Spain, and Portugal. This time, the summit was called to study 
an agenda that primarily focuses on commerce and integration as 
ways to further development. 
  To advance these goals, and as proposed by the host nation 
of 
Colombia, all participating governments have had access to the 
draft of the conference's final declaration, which has undergone 
ad hoc modifications based on suggestions, proposals, and points 
of view not included in the original draft. 
  This is the process being used to prepare the document, and 
it is to continue until the final version is drawn up the 
evening before the summit. The foreign ministers will then 
review the document before sending it to the presidents for 
consideration. The latter will be given seven minutes each to 
give a speech before they hold their first two plenary sessions 
on the opening day of the summit. 
  The statesmen also will be able to express their views on 
proposals presented by their colleagues during the closed-door 
debates that will follow. 
  According to reports, issues scheduled to be discussed 
include prospects for an international trade system, convergence 
of integration processes, competitiveness, and social 
development. 
  The host nation believes this exchange of opinion will prove 
to be the most important time for the dignitaries to freely 
discuss their positions. For this reason, measures have been 
taken to ensure absolute secrecy; what is said at this meeting 
will not be recorded in any document. 
  Analysts and diplomats linked to the summit predict it will 
be an interesting event, especially its debates on the 
relationship between economic growth and social development, as 
well as those on problems suffered in recent years by most Latin 
American countries because of severe adjustment programs that 
have had serious negative impacts on low-income sectors. 
  In advance of Cuba's participation in the summit, Deputy 
Foreign Relations Minister Jorge Bolanos mentioned the need for 
the final declaration to adequately reflect Latin American 
reality. 
  Bolanos noted that one cannot forget the situation of 
210-220 
million of the region's inhabitants for whom it is impossible to 
speak of development without social justice because they live 
below the poverty level. 
  Another highlight of the debate could be the prospects for 
the new internatioanl trade regime approved in April in the 
Moroccan city of Marrakech following the conclusion of the GATT 
talks. 
  When evaluating this topic, the Ibero-American leaders will 
have to take into account other nations' policies and positions 
which hinder trade liberalization, such as the U.S. blockade 
against Cuba. 
  Just as at the third summit, which took place a year ago in 
the Brazilian city of Salvador, it is hoped that the fourth 
summit will issue a statement rejecting the U.S. 
Administration's coercive measures against Cuba. 
<H5>  Agreement Mechanism Becomes Consolidated </H5>
  In its fourth year of existence, the Ibero-American Summit 
mechanism seems headed to consolidating itself as a means of 
agreement and consensus of wills, with integration as a 
still-distant but feasible goal. 
  Starting with the first summit in Guadalajara in 1991, 
followed by the meetings in Madrid in 1992 and in Salvador in 
1993, we can see an increasing consolidation of goals and 
potential of this group of nations, all of which are 
interconnected through their languages, culture, and history. 
  Along with this impressive natural base for cooperation, 
common interests have been added as a result of the evolution of 
international relations, including the trend toward 
globalization of the world economy and the consolidation of 
blocs and partnerships. 
  The founding conference in Guadalajara decided to turn a 
host of historic and cultural affinities into an instrument of 
unity and development. 
  The second summit in Madrid coincided with the spectacular 
festivities with which the Spanish Government and crown 
celebrated the fifth centennial of Christopher Columbus' arrival 
in America. 
  Brazil hosted the third summit and gave it a new and 
superior 
character by dedicating it to sustained development with a 
social emphasis. 
  One of the peculiarities of the Ibero-American meetings is 
that, from the beginning, they have worked with a temporary 
secretariat held by the country where the next meeting is 
scheduled. Those who favor this system argue that it prevents 
the creation of a permanent administrative apparatus with 
additional expenses and bureaucratic red tape. 
  Others, however, believe it is time for the conference to 
set 
up a permanent secretariat to serve as liaison to supervise 
compliance with the agreements reached at each summit. 
  In just three years, the Ibero-American leaders have 
ratified 
72 agreements covering 31 different topics that include 
agriculture, trade, cooperation, terrorism, sovereignty, 
culture, and health. 
  The dispute that arose in Salvador on whether the summits 
should be held annually or biannually seems to have been 
resolved in practice following the announcement of venues for 
upcoming summits until the year 2000. 
  Argentina will host the 1995 summit, Chile in 1996, El 
Salvador 1997, Portugal 1998, and Panama in the year 2000. The 
1999 summit remains vacant and, in the opinion of the Colombian 
Government, should be assigned to Cuba. 
  Anyway, everything seems to indicate that the Ibero-American 
mechanism has become a superior starting point on the path 
toward agreement. In terms of this mechanism, Latin America 
benefits greatly from the regional unity these summits 
encourage, while it also benefits because of the mutually 
advantageous relationships established among different 
industrialized areas and with members of the European Union -- 
relationships that are maintained on a level of equality, not 
submission.

  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 Jun (PL) -- The 24th OAS General 
Assembly continued today receiving new requests urging the 
readmittance of Cuba into the OAS, from which it was removed in 
1962 due to its political disagreement with the United States. 
  During the second day of talks in Belem, Para State, 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim reintroduced the topic 
of Cuba's readmittance before the OAS meeting and reiterated the 
need for "reviewing the Cuban situation within the hemispheric 
community." 
  During the inauguration of the 24th OAS Assembly on Monday, 
outgoing OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares as well as 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco recommended that Cuba's 
readmittance be considered, although this topic is not part of 
the agenda to be discussed at the meeting which will conclude 
Friday. 
  In his speech to the foreign ministers and representatives 
of 
the 34 OAS-member countries, Amorim recalled that his country 
"maintains friendly relations and has significant cultural links 
with Cuba." 
  "Despite everything, we do not believe that economic and 
political isolation is the best way to contribute to a 
transition that is already in the making in that country," 
Amorim added. 
  Baena Soares, who will conclude almost a decade as head of 
the OAS on 20 June, made similar statements yesterday. 
  "As everyone knows, I have been inquiring whether this is 
the 
right moment for OAS members to review the measure adopted over 
30 years ago when the Cuban Government was suspended ... the 
90's are not the 60's," he stated. 
  According to diplomatic sources, this was the first time the 
outgoing OAS head has dealt with this topic officially before a 
regular OAS General Assembly. 
  "Cuba's removal is not in keeping with the political 
revolution the world has faced in the past years," he added. 
  Meanwhile, President Franco supports that Cuba be readmitted 
and the OAS reassess its position regarding Cuba. "Brazil 
favors a harmonious dialogue among all nations, without 
exceptions," he added. 
  In statements to the media in Belem, Bolivian Foreign 
Minister Antonio Aranibar expressed his support for Cuba's 
readmittance into the OAS while his Costa Rican counterpart 
Fernando Naranjo proposed that the OAS establish channels of 
communication with the Cuban Government.

  [Text] Washington, D.C., 6 Jun (PL) -- Cuban-American 
organizations, headed by the Cuban-American Peace Committee, 
will meet with U.S. congressmen on 9 June to decry the U.S. 
blockade against Cuba. 
  Committee President Raymundo Del Toro has said this meeting 
will be the appropriate venue to support the Free Trade With 
Cuba Bill, sponsored by Democrat Charles Rangel, a New York 
representative. 
  Del Toro has said the time has arrived for the Clinton 
administration to change U.S. policies toward Cuba now that the 
United States has renewed the most-favored-nation status to the 
PRC and lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam. 
  According to the committee president, President Clinton is 
associating with the reactionary minority of the Cuban exiles, 
making, he believes, the economic blockade against Cuba a 
lucrative business. 
  Del Toro has said the U.S. head of state lost the 1992 
elections in Florida and will lose again in 1996 if he insists 
on associating with this minority group of the Cuban exile 
community. 
  Delegates of the Cuban-American Committee in Miami, New 
Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, Chicago, and Philadelphia will 
attend this meeting. 
  These demonstrators will be joined by such groups as the 
Cuban Change, the Cuban-American Education Committee, the 
Antonio Maceo Brigade, and the Cuban-American Organization for 
the Dignity of Miami. 
  The president of the Cuban-American Peace Committee said 
that 
religious and public health organizations, such as the American 
Public Health Association, the Free Trade With Cuba Association, 
the General Council of Churches in Society, the United Methodist 
Church, the Global Exchange, and the Pastors for Peace, among 
others, will be represented at the demonstrations to support the 
lifting of the blockade.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 12 Jun (PL) -- Haitians reacted today 
to the state of emergency announced by provisional President 
Emile Jonassaint with the same indifference Washington did. 
  Life continued as normal in the neighboring nation, whose 
inhabitants seem more interested in resolving the issue of 
sustenance -- cut off to a great extent by the harsh sanctions 
imposed against the military authorities -- than alarmed by the 
threat of a foreign invasion. 
  It was not until early this morning when, in a significant 
move, Jonassaint, who is not recognized worldwide, urged fellow 
countrymen via radio and television to unite and resist in light 
of the possibility of the eventual use of force to restore 
ousted Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. Although he did not 
specify the measures involved in the imposed state of emergency, 
Jonassaint ordered the urgent preparation of troops. 
  This is taking place shortly after the tightening of 
restrictions by U.S. President Bill Clinton, who seeks the 
removal of coupist General Raoul Cedras and his supporters 
through the suspension of commercial flights and the elimination 
of financial operations. Despite this step, Clinton has not 
entirely rejected the military option. A cold U.S. reaction 
followed the announcement in Port-au- Prince. This reaction 
came about when William Gray, Clinton's representative for 
Haitian affairs, doubted that Jonassaint's declaration will have 
any effect. 
  In the first official statement by the White House, Gray 
refused to refer to the possibility of military intervention in 
Haiti, but conceded that it is one of the options available to 
the U.S. President.

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (PL) -- The Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN] today rejected the peace agreements 
proposed by the Mexican Government -- a peace plan that was 
designed to put an end to the armed conflict that erupted in 
Chiapas State in the country's southern region in January. 
  Three communiques signed by Subcommander Marcos announced to 
the media that in the consultation process with the communities, 
97.33 percent voted against signing the government proposal, 
while 96.47 percent favored not resuming hostilities. 
  For this reason, the rebels' General Command reported that 
the EZLN has officially declared the San Cristobal negotiations 
closed, and it has called on the people to enter a new dialogue 
"with all of the progressive forces in the country." 
  Nevertheless, with the purpose of not interfering with the 
upcoming August elections, the guerrillas have ordered their 
regular and irregular forces to unilaterally extend the 
cease-fire. The rebels also ruled out any EZLN actions against 
the Federal Government. 
  In addition, the rebels will permit the installation of 
voting sites in the territory under their control. These voting 
sites will be supervised by nongovernmental organizations and 
the International Red Cross. 
  The EZLN has warned that it "absolutely will not accept any 
federal, state, or municipal aid and will resist the situation 
with its own means and with the assistance of the Mexican 
people." 
  It also warned, "We will continue to fight as long as the 
national flag does not fly in democracy, freedom, and justice 
over Mexican territory." The rebels also proposed holding "a 
national democratic convention" to create a provisional or 
transitional government.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Jun (PL) -- Mexican and Cuban sources 
have affirmed that Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
agenda during his visit to Cuba on 13 June will be intense and 
multifaceted, with an emphasis on political issues. 
  Salinas will arrive in this capital on Monday, 1100 local 
time, where he will devote most of his time to an interview with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro. With Castro, he will engage in an 
overall analysis of the bilateral political, economic, cultural, 
and trade relations, a high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry 
official indicated. 
  Jorge Bolanos, deputy foreign relations minister, emphasized 
in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' presence in 
Cuba represents the continuation of relations that historically 
have been maintained at a high level. Bolanos, who counts on a 
30-year diplomatic career, also highlighted the independent 
nature of Mexico's foreign policy and the priority Cuba puts in 
these relations. 
  Bolanos disclosed that the preparatory mission of Mexican 
officials, led by General Director of Protocol Ricardo Ampudia, 
has concluded its meeting with the local Foreign Ministry, 
during which they agreed that the visit should concentrate on 
the official conversations of both high-level delegations. 
  He highlighted the importance of Salinas' presence in Cuba 
at 
a time when the United States is attempting to reinforce the 
economic blockade, considering this a sign of political 
willingness on the part of Mexican authorities to reaffirm their 
relations with the Island and to continue developing these in 
the future. 
  Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias gave a 
similar 
opinion, emphasizing that the conversations at the highest 
levels between both nations will be intense and multifaceted. 
New ideas and initiatives will emerge from this dialogue to 
continue the momentum of bilateral ties, Tello told PRENSA 
LATINA. 
  Another important aspect of the dialogue between the 
presidents of Cuba and Mexico will be the exchange of points of 
view on the Ibero-American summit to be held on 14-15 June in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Mexico was the only Latin 
American nation that decided to maintain its relations with Cuba 
in 1962 when the OAS ruled, under Washington's pressure, to have 
its member nations break ties with the Island.

  [Text] Havana, 9 Jun (PL) -- A high-ranking Foreign 
Ministry official said here today Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's upcoming visit to Cuba exhibits his 
country's political resolve to strengthen bilateral relations 
and project them toward the future. 
  In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, Deputy Foreign 
Minister Jorge Bolanos said Salinas' visit will focus on 
political issues, especially during the talks he will hold with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro to analyze the broad range of 
historical ties between the two nations. 
  Citing the importance of the visit by the Mexican head of 
state, Bolanos emphasized this meeting will take place amid a 
U.S. effort to toughen policies of siege against Cuba, policies 
which recall previous administrations. 
  U.S. Representative Robert Torricelli's recent visit to 
Mexico and Washington's fruitless efforts to direct the latest 
OAS meeting in Brazil against Cuba are some of these policies. 
  The high-ranking official, who has been a diplomat for more 
than 30 years, also said the White House is planning to hold a 
hemispheric summit in Miami in December, a summit that excludes 
Cuba, making it, therefore, an anti-Cuban summit. 
  Bolanos said the delegations of the two governments will 
discuss the wide assortment of political, economic, commercial, 
and cultural relations and scientific and technical 
collaboration during the high profile talks they will hold. 
  He believes new ideas and initiatives that will help broaden 
bilateral ties and project them toward the future will emerge 
from the talks between the Mexican and Cuban presidents. 
  The deputy foreign minister also said the two chiefs of 
state 
will have the opportunity to exchange opinions on the agenda and 
role of the Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June. 
  President Salinas will arrive in this capital on 13 June at 
1500 GMT (Universal Time Coordinator) and will leave for 
Colombia the same day at 2130 GMT.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by PRENSA LATINA contributor Jose dos </F>
Santos: "Cuba-Mexico: The Path Is Made as We March. 
Cuban-Mexican Relations Face a Very Complex, but Also 
Promising, in More Than One Way, Future"] 
  [Text] Havana -- Passing over hurdles and skirting 
stumbling blocks and snares, Cuba and Mexico have consolidated a 
relationship that, due to its duration and fruitfulness, is 
unique: above empty rhetorics, the times, differences in 
projects, foreign pressure, and circumstantial emergencies. 
  Forefather Benito Juarez' expression "peace is the fruit of 
the respect shown for the rights of others" had shaped the 
already lengthy period that began when Mexican President Adolfo 
Lopez Mateos refused to break relations with Cuba when the rest 
of the Latin American governments obeyed an order to that effect 
from Washington. 
  At that moment, the already excellent relations ascended to 
that of exceptional relations, and this was the diamond that 
topped the tiara of a historic phase of respect for Cuba's 
decision to take its own road in exercise of the principle of 
self-determination, and the Mexican decision served as a lesson 
and example for others who, in due time, decided to follow suit. 
  This recounting is timely in view of the visit to Cuba by 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas, the fourth Mexican president 
who by his visit, a very brief one, will endorse ties and 
nurture feelings that transcend authorities and promote a sense 
of brotherhood and not just unite neighboring nations. 
  Salinas' visit upholds a tradition that was initiated by 
Luis 
Echeverria in August 1975 and preserved by Jose Lopez Portillo, 
in July 1980, and Miguel de la Madrid in 1981. On those 
occasions, the rejection of the isolation the United States 
wants to impose on the Cuban process was made evident. 
  Today's situation is more complex for the two nations: Cuba 
is enduring an intensification of the blockade that has 
compounded a crisis produced by the vanishing traditional and 
unfaltering trade partners. Mexico is facing a massive process 
of integration with two big economic powers, one of which is 
Cuba's main antagonist. 
  Domestically, Mexican authorities are facing what is, 
perhaps, the most rickety election process in its history, with 
unprecedented political tension (the armed uprising in Chiapas 
and the assassination of the presidential candidate of the 
governing party, among others). 
  In this context, Salinas' visit to Cuba can be interpreted 
as 
a diplomatic gesture or, perhaps, as a tactic, or as an 
expression of a more important and profound will. 
  The visit could represent all of this. The truth is that the 
visit has come as a U.S. legislator, who has the airs of a 
proconsul, has launched overseer-type demands against Mexico's 
rights to self-determination the same way he headed the 
anti-Cuban campaign in the U.S. Congress to make Cuba yield to 
its particular vision of what democracy and liberty mean. 
  It could be the sight of stable and promising relations that 
are unaffected by eventual problems have moved the industrious 
inquisitor Robert Torricelli to aim his guns at a government 
that definitely does not yield to blackmail despite powerful 
economic commitments and remains firm to a tradition that has 
overcome all types of pressure. 
<H5>  Current Situation and Outlook </H5>
  Salinas will find in Cuba a situation different from what he 
found when he visited the island in March 1987 on the occasion 
of the 6th Conference of Ministers and Chiefs of Economic 
Planning of Latin America, when he was the Mexican Government's 
programming and budget secretary. 
  Although the island's current economic situation is more 
difficult than ever, Cuba's relations with Mexico during this 
period have been most intense in the fields of cooperation, 
investments, and cultural, sports, scientific and technological, 
and educational ties, among others. 
  One recent example is the celebration of the 11th plenary 
session of the Bilateral Business Committee, in which 50 Mexican 
firms participated. This session strengthened the decision to 
increase Cuban exports and promote negotiations capable of 
benefiting trade between the two countries. 
  As Cuba imports food, chemical products, and raw materials, 
Mexico buys tobacco, rum, marble, construction materials, 
equipment, and products from the health and veterinary sectors. 
  Since the trade balance favors Mexico, the challenge of 
increasing these relations is being met by balancing the 
difference "through the creation of patrimonial interests," read 
investments, by Mexican businessmen in Cuba. 
  Luis Miguel Porras, who was Mexico's commercial adviser on 
the island until his recent death, reported that in 1993, 
Mexican annual exports to Cuba, which in the 1980's had been for 
$60 million or $80 million, reached a record high of $150 
million. 
  Porras once told newsman Fernando Davalos that "Mexico is 
interested in Mexican investors getting settled in Cuba because 
as Cuba's agricultural, industrial, and services sectors 
increase their activities and are able to export, the island 
will be resolving its trade balance deficit." 
  This is why here there is talk about the possibility of 
exporting to Mexico goods such as sea products, essential oils, 
zeolite, citrus, and computer software, and about joint 
productions, reestablishing industrial production using Mexican 
raw material, and servicing markets from Cuba. 
  There is a hush about this because there are abundant 
examples of how Washington's anti-Cuban paranoia and meddling 
have worked to frustrate more than one important deal for the 
two sides. 
  This is why it is not possible to give details about the 
growing patrimonial links being established here by Mexican 
businessmen whose interests are linked to the development of 
Cuban products intended for Mexican markets. For example, 
investments in tourism, such as Varadero's Tuxpan Hotel, and in 
textiles and tourism. 
  The same diplomat said that there is work going on on 
projects such as the refining of oil and mining and that there 
are studies "for participating in the exploitation and 
processing of nickel." 
  In some important operations, he said, it has become 
necessary to consider the problem of the Cuban foreign debt (the 
amount of which he did not report but that some believe is 
around $400 million, peanuts compared to others that exist 
throughout the world). 
  There is a tacit understanding on this between the two 
countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina. He has said: "There are many ways of resolving the 
debt, and we are in no position to say which ways these are" 
because "there is all sort of pressure" on whoever tries to 
trade with Cuba. 
  In February, the Cuban foreign minister told LA JORNADA of 
Mexico that he has "much evidence on how Mexico is capable of 
overcoming pressure." He noted that "the situations of the 
world, of Mexico, and Cuba are different." 
  Bilateral ties have checked facts that were not appreciated 
here, such as President Salinas receiving Cuban 
counterrevolutionaries, and episodes of boat people and of 
persons who forced their departure from the country with illegal 
actions. 
  Robaina would explain this in a few words: (With Mexico) 
"there are exceptional relations, respect, and understanding..." 
  The fact is that beyond the ups and downs of politics there 
is progress in projects in key sectors such as agriculture and 
livestock, industrial, telecommunications, fisheries, and food 
sectors and the importance of the recent visit by an significant 
Mexican Parliamentary delegation to the island cannot be ignored. 
  It is almost commonplace to report that 90 Mexican sportsmen 
have participated in eight disciplines in competitions held in 
Cuba during the first four months of the year, that university 
rectors from the two countries will meet in Mexico during the 
second half of June, and that cities like Monterrey and Holguin 
have become sister cities. 
  It is also commonplace to report that Foreign Secretary 
Manuel Tello fully agreed with his Canadian counterpart in 
condemning the U.S. blockade on Cuba, or that he told Warren 
Christopher that the Cuban issue is one of the differences his 
country has with the United States. 
  In a recounting of this we cannot fail to mention the 
powerful and active movement of popular solidarity with Cuba in 
Mexico, a movement that serves as a liaison for the breaking in 
U.S. territory of the blockade against Cuba. 
  Cuban-Mexican relations are a very complex issue, but 
promising, in more than one sense. This situation is endorsed 
by those who, like colleague Luis Soto likes to say, no longer 
fear U.S. Government threats and dare "pull the tiger's 
whiskers," even if it gets angry. 
  One does not have to be a sorcerer to imagine how the White 
House sees Salinas' visit to Cuba only a few weeks after William 
Clinton raised the tone of his anti-Cuban discourse to almost 
the regressive level of his predecessors. The Mexican gesture 
will be interpreted in many ways, but it cannot fail to be seen 
as a sign that Cuba and Mexico continue blazing a trail as they 
march on.

  [Text] Mexico City, 9 Jun (PL) -- The Third National 
Campaign for Cuba in Mexico concluded today after collecting 
nearly 200 tons of fuel, medicine, food, and school supplies, a 
reflection of the traditional ties between the two peoples. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Escamilla, coordinator 
of the solidarity group Let's Go for Cuba, reported that on this 
occasion they managed to collect 160 tons of hydraulic oil, 14 
tons of rice, and a yet undetermined amount of medicine, school 
supplies, and various other materials. 
  The humanitarian aid, he added, will soon be transported to 
the Port of Tampico and from there will be shipped to its final 
destination in the largest of the Antilles. Also, on Thursday 
members of organizations that support Cuba gathered in front of 
the headquarters of Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) and disclosed the 
text of a note handed to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at 
the National Palace. 
  The document urges the Mexican chief of state to take 
advantage of the high-level contacts that will take place in 
upcoming days between the governments of the two nations to 
produce and strengthen agreements in the economic and political 
areas that would represent progress in the struggle against the 
U.S. blockade. 
  Moreover, the document adds that the difficult energy 
situation facing the Cuban people forces us to urge the 
government of this country to adopt a number of measures, on a 
priority basis, to favor mechanisms to supply petroleum to Cuba. 
It points out that the blockade must be broken up, not with 
words, but with concrete actions to show the Washington 
administration that it cannot step over the sovereignty of 
peoples and nations. 
  The organization points out that it is pleased with the 
progress achieved by trade agreements on fossil fuels, which for 
some time were among the goals of this movement in solidarity 
with Cuba. Organization members said this third campaign showed 
that concrete people-to-people solidarity actions reflect the 
determination to erect a wall to block U.S. restrictions against 
Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- Colombian Ambassador to Cuba 
Ricardo Santamaria said in Havana today that Colombia is 
organizing a conference for private businessmen to study future 
investments in Cuba, and he added that Cuban ministers and other 
ranking officials will be invited. 
  In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria explained 
that 
the Colombian Economic Development Ministry is preparing to hold 
this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota in July. With this in mind, 
Colombian companies interested in trade and investment with the 
island are being consulted. 
  This important meeting, along with the great progress 
achieved in relations between the two Latin American nations 
during the past few months, will provide greater knowledge of 
investment possibilities, existing legislation, and other 
important details concerning Cuba, the diplomat said. 
  Santamaria said: The idea is to hold frank, direct 
conversations between businessmen and Cuban officials, 
especially representatives of businesses accepting foreign 
capital, because we believe that in tourism, trade, and some 
industrial fields there are still areas to be explored. 
  The talks in Santa Fe de Bogota will be held independently 
of 
any agreements already reached by Colombia and Cuba, as well as 
independently of the specific advances made during visits by 
nine Colombian delegations that have traveled to Havana in 
recent months. 
  The ambassador also stressed the work done by joint 
commissions in areas such as education, sports, culture, 
science, and technology, which have resulted in a number of 
agreements, including agreements between universities in the two 
nations and the corresponding heads of sports organizations. 
  Regarding tourism, Santamaria noted the recent participation 
of Colombian tour operators and Prospero Carbonell, the 
president of Colombia's National Tourist Corporation, at the 
tourism convention in Varadero. He also highlighted the 
negotiations concerning the sale of multiple destination 
packages and other types of excursion packages. 
  Colombian businessmen have already signed agreements with 
Cubanacan Corporation, which will lead to the construction of 
new hotels on the beaches of Varadero and Santa Lucia -- the 
latter of which is located in the central province of Camaguey 
-- and to the joint management of the Yagrumas Hotel on the 
outskirts of Havana. 
  In another segment of the interview, Santamaria discussed 
the 
Colombian people and government's satisfaction with Colombia's 
recent designation as the site of the upcoming Nonaligned 
Movement summit and, consequently, its assumption of the 
presidency of the organization in 1995. 
  Santamaria said: We view this as a recognition of Colombia's 
international policy and as an important challenge to the nation. 
  Reviewing the responsibilities that will accompany this 
designation, the head of the Colombian mission in Cuba stressed 
the importance of coordinating the actions of the 110 countries 
that comprise the Nonaligned Movement. 
  The new Colombian Government, which will begin its mandate 
on 
7 August, will take on this enormous task, together with the 
entire nation, in light of the important role of the nonaligned 
nations in the new international scene, Santamaria concluded.

<F P=106> [By Aissa Garcia and Roverto Gili] </F>
  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 8 Jun (PL) -- Liberal 
presidential candidate Ernesto Samper, 44, today stated his 
intention to continue his country's ties with Cuba and to oppose 
the U.S. blockade on the island if he becomes president in the 
next elections. 
  I am going to maintain the ties President Cesar Gaviria 
Trujillo restored, because in this era of pluralism that Latin 
America -- and we hope Colombia as well -- is living there can 
be no country with which we do not have relations, Samper said 
during an exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA. "My 
irrevocable decision," Samper added, "is not just to maintain 
open relations with the island but also not to accept any 
measure that entails increasing the difficulties the Cuban 
people are already experiencing." 
  I am totally opposed to the (U.S.) blockade and any measure 
that worsens the living conditions in that country, Samper, the 
Liberal presidential candidate in the runoff elections to be 
held on 19 June, stated. Samper's sole opponent this time is 
Conservative Andres Pastrana. The two ran in the first round on 
22 May in a field with 16 other candidates, but neither one was 
able to garner 51 percent of the votes, as the Constitution 
establishes. 
  Samper also said that he will try to bring about a change in 
the agenda of the Nonaligned Movement to bring it in step with 
the times. As for his national platform, Samper said the only 
way to legitimize the economic opening process in Latin America 
is through social investment. I do not see, he stressed, any 
other way that it may trickle down and make everybody feel part 
of the economy. 
  The Liberal leader ran for president in 1990, but current 
President Gaviria won the primaries. On the eve of those 
elections, he was the victim of an attack in which he was shot 
11 times. Four of those bullets are still lodged in his body. 
Colombian news media have reiterated that his Conservative 
adversary in the current elections is using or repeating the 
programmatic budgets Samper had outlined earlier. "He 
(Pastrana) has a sort of guilt complex over everything he has 
copied this past year, but it is sufficient to see what his 
platform is: pretty reactionary, neoliberal, and prehistoric," 
he commented. 
  Samper, a lawyer and economist, met with PRENSA LATINA 
envoys 
in his main office shortly before leaving for the town of 
Toribio, some 60 km south of Bogota, the site of a strong 
earthquake registered on Monday where approximately 150 persons 
lost their lives, although the tragedy may leave an even higher 
toll.

  [Text] Doha, 8 Jun (QNA-Pool) -- Qatari Health Minister 
Sheik Hamad bin Suhaym al Thani received Cuban Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina during his visit to Qatar. 
  They discussed several issues in the health and medical 
sectors that will strengthen cooperation between the two 
countries, including the possibility of hiring Cuban physicians 
and nurses to work in Qatari hospitals and Cuba's willingness to 
cooperate in the training of physicians at the School of 
Medicine, which the local university will establish. 
  During their meeting, the two ministers also discussed the 
possibility of specialized personnel in both countries sharing 
information in the pharmacological, technical, and biological 
fields as well as in advanced medicine and vaccine industries. 
  Cuba, with a population of 11 million people, has 21 schools 
of medicine, four schools of dentistry, and 51,000 physicians 
and 76,500 nurses as of 1990. Official information also reveals 
that between 4,500 and 5,000 physicians graduate every year and 
that the country has 270 hospitals and 423 health centers.

  [Text] Havana, 4 Jun (PL) -- The saturation of the market 
with large amounts of Cuban-made liquor and cigarettes will 
result in a reduction of 500 million pesos (same amount in 
dollars) in circulating money this year alone. 
  This was disclosed today at a plenary meeting held in this 
city by the Communist Party Provincial Committee and attended by 
officials from the enterprises that manufacture these goods. 
  The government recently adopted an increase in the prices of 
liquor and cigarettes as part of a plan to cleanse national 
finances, which are being affected by a surplus of money in 
circulation estimated at $11 million. 
  Some 428,000 cigarette boxes, which will be sold freely, 
aside from the quotas assigned by ration cards, as well as over 
24 million liters of rum and other alcoholic beverages, will be 
available to the population this year. 
  This effort to reduce money in circulation will be added to 
the revenues collected, with the same objective in mind, through 
increases in the prices of other nonbasic products.

  [Text] Mexico City, 3 Jun -- During an interview on 2 June 
with six foreign press groups, including MAINICHI SHIMBUN, 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said: "The 
delegation of the Japanese private sector has confirmed to me 
that it has the intention of investing in and starting business 
operations in Mexico. The Honda Motor Company, Ltd., will also 
launch its production of passenger cars. Investment by Japan 
has been materializing." The president thus refuted the view 
that "Japan's investment in Mexico is sluggish." Mexican mass 
media reported that the Japanese delegation expressed a cautious 
view on the investment environment in Mexico during recent 
meetings with the president and other government officials 
concerned. 
  With regard to the country-of-origin certification system of 
NAFTA, Salinas said, "Efforts should be made to ensure the 
transparency of the system so that non-NAFTA member nations can 
easily understand it." He then stressed the advantage of 
investing in Mexico, saying, "Mexico's population is 85 million 
people, and its market is the 10th largest in the world." 
  As for the fact that Mexico succeeded in joining the OECD, 
Salinas said: "Mexico needs strategies to approach the markets, 
financial resources, and technologies (of developed countries). 
The establishment of NAFTA and Mexico's participation in the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum have enabled 
Mexico to expand the markets in North America and Asia for its 
products. It can also have access to the European market 
through the OECD. Mexico's financial system and technologies 
have been gradually catching up with those of developed 
countries." He thus expressed confidence in Mexico's economic 
growth. 
  Touching on the investigation into the assassination of Mr. 
Colosio, who was the presidential candidate of the ruling party, 
Salinas denied the possibility of this case remaining unsolved, 
saying, "Investigations will be conducted until the truth is 
learned."

  [Text] President Alberto Fujimori of Peru arrived in Japan 
on the afternoon of 5 June. He gave an exclusive interview to 
NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters in Tokyo. 
  The president talked about the presidential election 
scheduled for April 1995. While he said: "I have not decided 
whether to run as a candidate," he also emphasized: "The 
reforms we implemented in the past four years have been very 
successful. The present regime has improved the life of the 
majority of Peruvian people. No political regime has been able 
to affect reforms in such a short period." He showed strong 
confidence in his reelection chances based on his record of 
successful reforms. 
  This is Fujimori's fifth visit to Japan, including visits he 
made before becoming president. He is scheduled to hold talks 
with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 6 June. 
  President Fujimori stressed: "We implemented several 
successful stabilization programs, including one on eradicating 
violence. If a weaker regime should come into power, it will be 
dangerous for Peru." 
  Commenting on rumors that former UN Secretary General Javier 
Perez De Cuellar intends to run for the presidency, Fujimori 
limited himself to saying: "I know about that. I expect all 
sorts of people to announce their candidacy from now on." 
  Discussing economic reforms, Fujimori pointed out that "we 
have almost resolved the debt issue; the inflation rate, which 
used to be 50 percent a month, is down to 1 percent." He also 
predicted: "Gross domestic product (GDP), which declined each 
year under past regimes, attained a growth of 7.5 percent in 
1993, and will achieve a similar, or an even better growth rate 
in 1994." 
  Regarding foreign investments, Fujimori complained that 
"Japanese investors are conservative, compared to U.S. or 
Spanish investors." He indicated he would again request 
investments from Japan during his meeting with Prime Minister 
Hata on 6 June. He also said: "We hope the Export-Import Bank 
of Japan and Overseas Cooperation Fund will increase their 
assistance for medium-scale investment projects." 
  Regarding the unemployment issue, which has not seen any 
improvement, Fujimori claimed: "The solution depends on how 
successful we are in attracting foreign investments. If we are 
able to invite investments into Peru, which has rich natural 
resources, it will be possible to solve the problem of poverty." 
  At present, the Fujimori government is being strongly 
criticized by the United States and other countries for 
violating human rights because many civilians have been killed 
during campaigns to exterminate leftist guerrillas; and a new 
constitution providing for the revival of the death sentence for 
terrorists was enacted in late 1993. Fujimori asserted: "Human 
rights have achieved remarkable improvement in Peru, compared to 
the past 10 years. When you talk about human rights, first, you 
have to respect the rights of the Peruvian people, and not those 
of the terrorists."

  [Editorial Report] Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in 
Spanish on 1 June publishes on page 28, under the heading 
"Lacalle's Administration Was at the Height of Popularity in May 
in the Eyes of Public Opinion," an 800-word unattributed article 
on the results of a public opinion poll by Equipos Consultores 
for EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO on President Luis Alberto Lacalle 
and Montevideo Mayor Tabare Vazquez. 
  The article notes that 20 percent of voters approved of 
Lacalle's administration while 50 percent disapproved. It adds 
that although the net result "continues to be negative," this is 
"the best result ever scored by the president nationwide" in all 
public opinion surveys conducted by Equipos Consultores during 
Lacalle's term. The second highest was in August 1990 with 33 
percent. 
  The article remarks that this growth in Lacalle's popularity 
is contrary to the general trend in Uruguay since presidents' 
popularity generally deteriorates at the end of their term. 
  With regard to Mayor Tabare Vazquez, the article states that 
he continues to command "the approval of more than half" of 
Montevideo residents. The survey shows that "52 percent" of 
Montevideo residents approved of Vazquez' administration "while 
26 percent disapproved of it." The article remarks that this 
approval rate was "slightly lower than in previous months." 
  The article concludes by saying: "The information analyzed 
suggests that, for the time being, the assessment of the 
president's and mayor's administrations does not show the loss 
of face that is allegedly expected during the election campaign."

<F P=106> [Report by Diego Suarez; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Ibero-American Summit inaugurated today in 
Cartagena supported the creation of a great commercial union 
from Mexico to Argentina. It also condemned the current form of 
government in Haiti and announced its support for any measure 
that could guarantee the restoration of democracy in that 
Caribbean nation. 
  The technical commissions preparing the Ibero-American 
Presidential Summit in Cartagena ended their first day of work 
with a firm rejection of any form of commercial restrictions, 
including economic blockades, and a call to Latin American 
governments to be more flexible toward foreign investments. 
  For more than 12 hours, the representatives of Brazil, 
Colombia, Spain, Argentina, and Mexico worked on the final draft 
of a 15-page document to be signed by the 22 presidents who will 
meet in Cartagena starting tomorrow. In the document, the 
presidents openly condemn the current form of government in 
Haiti and give a green light to the implementation of 
exceptional measures to restore democracy on that island. 
  [Begin Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolano recording] 
Cuba condemns the illegal regime established in Haiti against 
President Aristide. [end recording] 
  [Begin Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister Eduardo Farias 
recording] I believe this topic surely will be discussed by the 
presidents, but it is not included in the document we have 
prepared. [end recording] 
  The document also recommends that the countries adopt 
specific plans to encourage social investment, reduce 
illiteracy, and extend coverage of public services to 70 percent 
of the inhabitants of the hemisphere. 
  [Begin Colombian Deputy Foreign Minister Luis Guillermo 
Grillo recording] The document calls for strengthening free 
trade. I would say it is a document with positive signs in all 
areas. [end recording] 
  Tomorrow, the 22 foreign ministers and presidents of the 
countries participating in this Ibero-American Summit will make 
a final revision of the document, which without clearly 
referring to Haiti or Cuba, condemns commercial blockades and 
restrictive practices to restore democracies in some countries.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The heads 
of state or government of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal 
reject economic blockades that negatively affect any country in 
the region, according to the draft of the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit Declaration. 
  According to this document, to which NOTIMEX had access, the 
leaders will repudiate "any measure that affects free commercial 
development, goes against international legal principles, and 
worsens the people's living conditions." Although the final 
document does not make a direct reference to the Cuban or 
Haitian situation, it does describe the economic blockade as 
"incompatible with the current international economic and 
political situation." 
  The heads of state or government who will participate in the 
summit that is to be held in this Colombian city on Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week, manifest their support for the UN 
resolution that demands the elimination of this type of measure. 
The first part of the document refers to commerce and 
integration as factors that further Ibero-American development 
and recommends the adoption of macroeconomic reforms, as well as 
the strengthening of the business sector. 
  The participants also propose that restrictive commercial 
practices be eliminated and underscore their commitment to 
multilateralism and commercial opening. Cooperation and mutual 
assistance, including the exchange of information, are 
considered indispensable for countries in the region to adapt to 
the new international order, according to the text. In order to 
overcome the obstacles that prevent a greater level of 
competition in interregional and international commerce, the 
heads of state or government will recommend that preferential 
treatment be granted to less developed countries. 
  At the meeting, which will be inaugurated by host President 
Cesar Gaviria next Tuesday, they will propose that the 
government's role in several countries be redefined and that 
priority be given to the rationing of expenses in other 
countries. This recommendation, mentioned in the 15-page 
document, aims to promote having the governments in the area 
concentrate their efforts in strategic areas, such as education 
and health, for the well-being of their people. 
  After evaluating the Ibero-American forum's development -- 
its first meeting was held in Guadalajara, in the western 
Jalisco State of Mexico, on July 1991 -- the participants will 
propose that a work method be established for future summits. 
The proposal's objective is for statements to concentrate on a 
specific area so as to avoid having another long list of topics 
that are frequently unconnected and incomplete," in the next 
summit, scheduled to be held in Argentina in 1995. [quotation

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 11 Jun (EFE) -- The 
Ibero-American countries yesterday committed themselves in 
Cartagena to step up measures to control and oversee the 
production, marketing, and possession of chemicals used to 
process drugs. 
  Justice ministers and judicial authorities meeting in 
Cartagena de Indias announced that they will reinforce 
surveillance operations at port, aerial, and ground terminals 
and will register all producers of basic chemicals to prevent 
their use by drug trafficking rings. 
  The "final document," which was signed in this city in the 
Colombian-Caribbean region, contains the main recommendations 
made to the governments. Its authors think that it is necessary 
to keep track of the chemicals and for its importers to confirm 
their final destination. Products such as caustic soda and 
ether, among others, are indispensable for the production of 
drugs such as cocaine and heroin. 
  As for money "laundering," the ministers reaffirmed the 
advisability of introducing in the legislation of Ibero-American 
countries provisions to facilitate investigations regarding the 
origin of capital when there are signs that they are the product 
of illegal drug trafficking. It also recommends cooperation 
systems to allow measures to follow up on such capital and the 
adoption of measures to intervene and, should it be necessary, 
to seize them. 
  Among the "document's" recommendations is one forcing 
financial institutions to identify their clients when 
establishing business relations and to file documents on all 
transactions for five years. They would have to advise the 
authorities should there be signs of possible "laundering." The 
meeting participants also recommended the drafting of a fiscal 
and banking cooperation agreement against capital "laundering" 
networks and the establishment of adequate procedures for 
internal controls and communications. 
  The "final document" of the 10th Conference of Justice 
Ministers of Ibero-America also recommended increased judicial 
cooperation among the countries. They agreed to establish a 
technical commission of experts to conduct a study on judicial 
cooperation and to propose ways to update and modify existing 
regulations. 
  Finally, the ministers called for the adoption of effective 
measures to protect human rights and suggested appointing in 
each country a "people's lawyer" or "ombudsman," who is 
independent of political authorities.

  [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 12 Jun (DPA) -- 
The Fourth Ibero-American summit will condemn Haiti's de facto 
regime because it is "one of the most unfortunate situations in 
our community," Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin disclosed 
today. 
  The Colombian foreign minister indicated that the topic is 
not on the agenda of the chiefs of state, who will attend the 
14-15 June meeting in Cartagena de Indians, but she said the 
Haitian situation will be analyzed "for certain." 
  "We will condemn the de facto regime, and we will support 
the 
embargo policy and the economic measures that are directed at 
having the current government open the doors to 
constitutionality," Sanin said. [passage omitted] 
  Sanin indicated that she does not know whether the topic of 
Cuba will also be addressed by the government leaders, although 
she said that in these types of meetings diverse topics may be 
debated. The foreign minister said that, since the previous 
summits, it has been observed that changes have been introduced 
by the Fidel Castro government, but she stressed that these are 
insufficient modifications. "We have seen some reforms, but not 
with the speed we would like. We respect Cuba's 
self-determination, although I do not want to deny that it would 
be very satisfactory for everyone if complete freedoms existed 
in that country," she commented. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 12 Jun (EFE) -- About 
to conclude his four-year term, and in advance of his assuming 
office as OAS secretary general, Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria is preparing to receive the leaders of the 23 
member-countries of the Ibero-American community in Cartagena de 
Indias. Beginning Tuesday, and for 48 hours, the presidents 
will hold the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and 
Government. 
  In an exclusive interview with EFE, Gaviria, who will cease 
to be president on 7 August and will likely assume office as OAS 
secretary general in September, explored some issues related to 
Latin American integration and to the future of the OAS. 
  [EFE] What is Colombia's outlook as it prepares to host the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit? 
  [Gaviria] We expect this summit, as the others that have 
preceded it, to result in an exchange of ideas and experiences 
and to be productive. We will debate economic issues, trade, 
investment, how to unite the trade processes we are involved in, 
how to improve opportunities for investment and savings in 
America, and how to preserve our special links with Spain and 
Portugal, which are our bridge to the European Union [EU]. 
  [EFE] Is this bridge truly operational? 
  [Gaviria] It has been working. It is our link with the EU, 
particularly via Spain. I think it is very useful. There have 
been disagreements, such as on the Andean countries' 
preferences. In the specific case of the preferential treatment 
that Colombia receives from the EU, the battle that Spain waged 
and the support we received from this country were decisive. 
  [EFE] Does Colombia regard these annual summits as useful? 
Does Colombia think it is necessary to hold these summits 
annually, or would it prefer them to be held every two years? 
  [Gaviria] We are maintaining a neutral position on this 
issue. We believe that the agendas of some countries tend to be 
a little overloaded for annual summits. This is not true in our 
case, however, and we support any decision made. We would vote 
neither for nor against holding these meetings on an annual 
basis. 
  [EFE] How do you think the Cartagena de Indias summit will 
influence the hemispheric summit President Bill Clinton has 
called to be held in Miami in December? Do you think the two 
meetings are compatible? 
  [Gaviria] I do not think either meeting will conflict with 
the other. First, the two agendas are very different. The 
subjects we will discuss with Spain and Portugal are very 
different from those we will discuss with the United States, a 
country with which we hold a much more complex, intensive, and, 
in some aspects, a much more conflicting relationship, but a 
relationship that offers us many opportunities. I do not see 
the two meetings competing with one another. 
  Some references to the Miami summit will probably be made in 
the Ibero-American summit. At least from Colombia's viewpoint, 
I do not see any kind of incompatibility regarding time or 
agendas. These summits apparently have demonstrated their 
usefulness and potential. Regarding the future, we should hold 
more, not less, of these kinds of meetings on the continent. I 
do not believe the presidents will have trouble attending 
several summits. 
  [EFE] What will the Ibero-American leaders tell Fidel Castro 
in Cartagena de Indias that they have not told him already? 
What do you think of the fact that he was not invited to the 
Miami meeting? 
  [Gaviria] I do not know what other heads of state will tell 
Castro. That is one subject that has been overlooked a bit. At 
the beginning, the subject of Cuba appeared to come up 
frequently in the summits, but now it has fallen away. More 
importance is attached these days to exchanging experiences and 
ideas than to an intensive debate with Cuba. The possibility of 
this subject springing up in a summit should not be ruled out, 
however. Regarding the Miami summit, it is a U.S. initiative, 
and, because of this, the United States has specified which 
countries it wants to attend and has left out Cuba, probably 
because there are no diplomatic relations between the two 
countries. 
  [EFE] In the Group of Three, Colombia has been one of the 
leading countries in the debate about relations with Cuba. Do 
you not feel a little frustrated to see that the rapprochement 
with Castro has not resulted in a political opening? 
  [Gaviria] Well, it is true that the economic opening has 
been 
considerably greater than the political opening. Nevertheless, 
I appreciate the changes that have been taking place in Cuba. 
The international community and myself regard these changes as 
insufficient, but I think they are moving in the right 
direction. Everyone expects to see more political changes that 
will make it possible for Cuba to be reinstated in the 
inter-American system. 
  [EFE] You will assume office as OAS secretary general in a 
few months. What do you think of your role as secretary 
general? What changes does the organization require? Which of 
these changes are most pressing? 
  [Gaviria] I do not think immediate changes will be 
introduced, because decisions in an international organization 
such as OAS are by nature made by consensus and made gradually. 
The secretary general can make suggestions, but it could take 
months, even years, for these suggestions to become changes. I 
think, however, that all across the continent there is a desire 
for the organization to adapt itself to the new agenda on the 
continent: trade and strengthening democracy and the mechanisms 
for the protection of human rights and the environment. This 
task could take many years but, if it is completed, it can make 
the OAS stronger and make it serve to meet the countries' most 
urgent needs. 
  [EFE] Do you agree with the frequently voiced charge that 
the 
OAS is an over-bureaucratized and slow organization? 
  [Gaviria] Although there was important progress in the way 
of 
modernization during Joao Baena Soares' term, the OAS has 
undergone an experience common to any truly international 
organization: The world changes much faster than these 
organizations, and, for this reason, the OAS lagged behind a 
little. The idea now is to put it in step with these changes.

President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said Central America will 
present joint proposals at the Fourth Ibero-American summit. 
The proposals will deal with sustained development, ecological 
defense, and the review of the Cuban and Haitian cases. 
  The Central American countries "are taking a joint proposal 
on the urgent need to form an alliance for sustained development 
in the region and ecological defense, which we hope the rest of 
the Ibero-American nations will join," De Leon Carpio said. 
  The president traveled to San Jose, Costa Rica, at 1430 
[2030 
GMT] to meet with his Central American counterparts to adopt a 
united position on these topics. De Leon expressed optimism 
about the positive results of the Ibero-American Summit to be 
held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14-15 June. 
  He added that the meeting of government leaders from Belize, 
Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and 
Panama, which begins today and ends tomorrow in San Jose, has 
the primary objective of establishing a "common front" for the 
defense of the region's interests. 
  Guatemalan Foreign Ministry sources told NOTIMEX that during 
the Cartagena summit the presidents will sign a document on the 
importance that greater trade integration has for the 
hemisphere's economies. A diplomat indicated that during the 
Ibero-American Summit the Central American presidents want to 
meet with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera to discuss a free trade agreement 
between those two countries and Central America. [passage 
omitted] 
  De Leon also said the Central American presidents will 
propose the review of the current crises in Haiti and Cuba. The 
Guatemalan president said that in Cuba's case, the island's 
return to the OAS must be conditioned on respect for human 
rights. 
  The president expressed concerned over the Haitian 
situation, 
indicating that the current economic blockade has been 
insufficient to restore a democratic regime and that, in 
addition, the threat of a military invasion is looming over 
Haiti. The violence in the Haitian capital due to the 
international sanctions against General Raoul Cedras' regime 
"greatly worries us, and we must seek effective solutions," De 
Leon added.

  [Excerpt] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 11 Jun (EFE) -- 
Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle said today that the goal of 
consolidating the Ibero-American community of nations continues 
firm, "even though many presidents are about to complete their 
terms." By this statement, Lacalle was alluding to his own case 
and that of Brazilian President Itamar Franco, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari, and Panamanian President Guillermo Endara. 
  The Uruguayan president was the first of the 22 chiefs of 
state and government to arrive in Cartagena de Indias to 
participate in the fourth Ibero-American summit that begins on 
Tuesday. 
  "It is a pleasure to step on Cartagena soil and to confirm 
that the objective we established for ourselves continues 
forward," Lacalle commented. He also praised "the great work of 
the government" of Cesar Gaviria who will end his term in 
August. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Belem -- After resolving the Haitian topic, the 
General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) 
immediately turned to a problem that is considered very serious 
in the community of nations of the Americas: violence against 
women. During the evening of 7 June, the delegates of the 34 
countries attending the meeting approved the "Convention of 
Belem do Para," an international juridical instrument "to 
prevent, punish, and eradicate" all types of physical, sexual, 
or psychological violence against the continent's female 
population. 
  The approval of the document was considered a great victory 
for a group of ambassadors who had worked for several months to 
overcome the resistance of some countries, Brazil among them, 
which were against the consideration of and debate on the 
subject in Belem. In the end, despite sarcastic statements by 
some delegates, and even after some typically macho kinds of 
jokes, the convention was unanimously approved. 
  The United States, Brazil, Mexico, Jamaica, and Canada, the 
countries that opposed debating the document during the plenary 
session this week, have some objections to the convention's 
text. Those countries preferred to reconsider the text and to 
submit it in advance to the United Nations World Conference on 
Women, due to be held next year in Beijing. Yet Ambassador 
Zelmira Regazzoli, president of the International Women's 
Commission (CIM), insisted on and succeeded in including the 
topic on the agenda of the Belem meeting. 
  The convention has five chapters. Article 1 of Chapter I 
states that violence against women is "any action that causes 
death, harm, or physical, sexual, or psychological suffering to 
women, either in the private or public sectors." 
  Chapter II can be summarized as saying that all women have 
the right to live free of violence; that women must be 
recognized to have the right to enjoy, exercise, and receive the 
protection of all the human rights and liberties upheld by all 
regional and international human rights instruments; and that 
women can freely and fully exercise their civil, political, 
economic, social, and cultural rights. 
  Still excited about the approval of the document, Venezuelan 
Ambassador Ana Lucina Garcia Maldonado, who is also a federal 
deputy and the author of bills defending women in her country, 
yesterday told O ESTADO: "This is a really momentous event. We 
are 250 million women in the Americas, and at the end of the 
20th century we still cannot say that we enjoy the rights that 
are recognized as belonging to all human beings. We still have 
to submit ourselves to all kinds of violence and remain 
practically silent, because no one protects us. Not much is 
said about this, but it is known that at least 150 million women 
in our continent suffer from one type of violence or the other. 
A major step has undoubtedly been made, and I myself am 
particularly very happy." 
  Ana Lucina, who suggested naming the Convention after Belem 
do Para, added that all OAS countries will now have to ratify 
the document in order to enforce it. 
<H5>  Disappearance </H5>
  A draft convention dealing with the forcible disappearance 
of 
people was also submitted to the OAS plenary session yesterday. 
The document was approved on 7 June by a working commission 
that addressed juridical and political topics. Everything 
seemed to indicate that it would also be approved by all OAS 
countries. 
  The convention defines forcible disappearance as the action 
-- by agents of the state -- of stripping someone of his 
freedom. Amnesty International, which was represented at the 
meeting, is working to make the countries of the Americas 
classify abduction as a crime.

  [Excerpt] Belem, 9 Jun (EFE) -- Foreign ministers and 
delegates attending the 24th OAS General Assembly today approved 
a resolution benefiting indigenous groups, as it commits them to 
celebrating on this continent the International Decade of the 
World's Indigenous Peoples. 
  The resolution, which was proposed by Bolivia and sponsored 
by Mexico and Guatemala, was unanimously approved today by the 
delegations of the 34 OAS member states on the fourth and 
penultimate day of the assembly. 
  The resolution entrusts the OAS secretary general with the 
task of acting as regional coordinator for the International 
Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples within the cooperation 
framework established with the United Nations. 
  Six months ago the UN General Assembly designated the decade 
starting on 10 December 1994 and ending in the year 2004 as the 
International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples.

  [Text] Belem, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The 34 OAS member countries on 
9 June decided to create a work group that will prepare an 
agenda for the Summit of the Americas organized by U.S. 
President Bill Clinton. 
  According to the resolution approved on 9 June during the 
24th General Assembly, the OAS considers essential the 
participation of the chiefs of state and government of all the 
hemisphere's countries, except for Cuba, which was not invited 
to the summit by the United States. 
  The Summit of the Americas and the Haitian crisis have been 
the main subjects of many of the debates in the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, which began on 6 June and should conclude on 10 June 
in Belem do Para, northern Brazil. 
  During the traditional unofficial meeting held before the 
assembly on 5 June, the OAS member countries' foreign ministers 
expressed the importance of the OAS, as the main political forum 
of inter-American dialogue, actively participating in the 
presidential summit by presenting proposals and preparing an 
agenda. 
  "I believe that one of the most important events of this 
assembly was the decision we made on 5 June to make the OAS 
actively participate in the Summit of the Americas," said 
Argentine Ambassador to the OAS Hernan Patino. 
  "The summit is very important because we admit a reality: 
The active participation of the United States in the solution 
of the problems of the continent's countries is indispensable," 
said Ecuadoran Ambassador to the OAS Blasco Pena-Herrera. 
  OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares himself, 
who 
this month steps down from his post after 10 years, said in his 
opening speech that the OAS should contribute to the success of 
the summit organized by Clinton. 
  Baena Soares mentioned "the positive and immediate reaction" 
of member countries to Clinton's invitation and added that "such 
favorable conditions to promote a broad and creative exchange 
among the chiefs of state and government have not taken place 
for a long time." 
  "I think that during the summit the OAS could mark its 
presence effectively. Its institutional organizations and 
mechanisms can help prepare and put into practice the results." 
  After several days of consultations, the member countries 
decided to approve on 9 June a resolution formalizing the OAS' 
role in the preparatory process for the Summit of the Americas. 
  In the resolution approved by acclamation, the OAS General 
Assembly recommends that the OAS Permanent Council -- which 
includes all the ambassadors accredited in Washington -- "make a 
contribution to the Summit of the Americas and follow up the 
recommendations it will make." 
  The OAS General Assembly also recommends that the OAS 
Permanent Council form a working group that "can call the 
extraordinary preparatory meetings necessary for such purpose." 
  In its resolution, the OAS considers the Miami summit "as a 
favorable occasion to adopt a plan of action that includes all 
the agreed-upon solutions for the challenges faced by the 
hemisphere's countries," as well as an "important chance to 
strengthen inter-American dialogue and cooperation." 
  Considering that the United States must make consultations 
and hold several preparatory meetings before the summit, the OAS 
has offered to operate as the "main political forum for 
dialogue" and to coordinate the meetings and prepare an agenda. 
  About the matters on which the countries of the Americas 
reached an agreement during the consultations on the summit, 
Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga said there is 
consensus in three main areas: the strengthening of democracy; 
the areas of commerce, investment, and integration; and 
sustained development without environmental deterioration. 
  Bolivia hopes the presidents will "engage in an effective 
dialogue and prepare a true working agenda in which hemispheric 
integration -- which is nothing but extending NAFTA to all 
countries of the Americas -- will become something real," 
Aranibar emphasized.

  [Text] Belem, 9 Jun (EFE) -- A mission representing 
Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer today foiled an attempt by 
opponents to Balaguer's government to raise electoral fraud 
charges against him at the plenum of the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, which is slated to close on 10 June. 
  A delegation of Balaguer's political opponents led by vice 
presidential candidate Fernando Alvarez Bogaert has 
unsuccessfully tried to participate in the OAS assembly -- which 
is being held at the city of Belem, Para State -- through an 
invitation extended to them by a Central American country, 
possibly Costa Rica. 
  The attempt was rejected by most of the 34 delegates, who 
centered their efforts on the Haitian crisis and the 
strengthening of the trade embargo to force the ouster of the 
"de facto" Haitian Government, thanks to behind-the-scenes 
negotiations conducted by Dominican Foreign Minister Juan 
Taveras and other Balaguer envoys. 
  Mario Read-Bitti, president of the Dominican Republic 
Central 
Bank, told EFE: "It is surprising that the opposition attempted 
to raise a domestic subject here that concerns only the 
Dominican people." 
  When it became clear that Alvarez would not be able to speak 
at the OAS plenum, the opposition mission sought to propose a 
draft resolution in which the OAS voices concern about the 
openness of the vote count conducted by the Dominican Central 
Electoral Board. 
  Diplomatic sources told EFE that although this initiative 
also failed OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares may refer to 
the Dominican elections in his closing speech on 10 June. 
  The OAS had sent a mission of observers to oversee the 
recent 
elections in Dominican Republic.

  [Text] Belem do Para, Brazil, 9 June (EFE) -- The OAS 
decided on 9 June to draft a report on juridical regulations 
that block hemispheric integration. 
  In a resolution approved on 9 June by the 24th OAS General 
Assembly, the OAS asks its Permanent Council -- made up of 
ambassadors from each OAS member country appointed to Washington 
-- to draft a report on juridical regulations that block 
integration and to submit a proposal on how to overcome them. 
  According to the OAS, the work's objective "is to make an 
inventory of legislation that must be repealed to achieve an 
effective continental integration." 
  The OAS, which defines integration as "an appropriate tool 
for achieving new economic and social realities that will help 
eradicate extreme poverty," believes it is necessary to 
eliminate all obstacles blocking hemispheric economic 
integration. 
  Moreover, the OAS recognizes that it is greatly interested 
in 
promoting a greater cooperation and strengthening of ties with 
"regional and subregional integration mechanisms and 
organizations." 
  The 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been going on since 
6 June in the city of Belem do Para in the Amazon of northern 
Brazil, approved a resolution stating that its mission is to 
conduct several juridical studies to assist these organizations 
in their integration efforts. 
  In the last few years, the countries of the Americas have 
negotiated regional and subregional agreements. They have 
established different economic blocs, such as NAFTA, the Common 
Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact, the Group of 
Three and the Amazon Integration Treaty. 
  According to Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranbiar 
Quiroga, true hemispheric integration is tantamount to 
"encompassing all countries of the Americas in NAFTA." 
  In its resolution, the OAS also recommends that its 
Permanent 
Council "duly coordinate issues pertinent to the development of 
legislation promoting integration with the activities of other 
OAS organizations and offices to promote economic integration." 
  Other organizations that work with the OAS in the 
integration 
process are the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) 
and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

<F P=106> [Report by Rafael Candanedo] </F>
  [Excerpts] Belem, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Cuba's readmission into 
the OAS is no longer viewed as a taboo issue within the 
organization, but its debate will be delayed and may be included 
in the agenda of the OAS general assembly in 1995. 
  The 34 delegates to the 24th OAS General Assembly -- the 
main 
forum of dialogue and agreement within the Americas and which 
will close on 10 June -- have addressed the possibility of 
readmitting Cuba into the OAS with a businesslike approach, 
although without much enthusiasm. 
  The 24th OAS General Assembly, which is hosted by the city 
of 
Belem, Para State, is chaired by Brazilian Foreign Minister 
Celso Amorim. It is in its final stage and is now being 
attended by second level delegates because most of the 
respective foreign ministers have already returned home. 
  Considering Cuba is the only Latin American country excluded 
from the OAS, Amorim viewed as significant the fact that the 
Cuban issue is no longer viewed as taboo and that it may be 
included in the agenda of the OAS. 
  A senior Foreign Ministry official of one Andean country 
rhetorically asked: "Why is it that the Cold War has ended and 
yet Cuba continues to be excluded from the Inter-American 
political system, which is regarded as universal and 
pluralistic"? [passage omitted] 
  OAS Secretary General Joao Baena Soares, whose 10-year 
tenure 
will conclude on 20 June when he will be replaced by Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, told reporters that a slight majority 
of OAS member states favor a debate on the "Cuban issue." 
  Brazilian President Itamar Franco immediately endorsed the 
initiative. The foreign ministers and delegates of Venezuela, 
Costa Rica, Canada, and Bolivia, among others, followed suit. 
[passage omitted] 
  Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo went as far as 
to announce at a plenary session that he is willing to negotiate 
among the United States, some Latin American countries, the 
Havana Government, and the Cuban opposition in exile, seeking to 
promote the democratization of Cuba. 
  One South American diplomat said the situation is 
complicated 
because of the extreme polarization of positions and of the 
radical stance of the United States, which does not conceal its 
interest in having President Castro step down. 
  Three positions can be identified among Latin American 
countries: First, a pro-U.S. position, which is endorsed by 
Argentina, El Salvador, and other Central American countries; 
second, a current -- which includes the Caribbean Community 
(Caricom) -- that promotes peaceful coexistence with Cuba and 
its readmission into the OAS; and third, a current that respects 
Cuban self-determination, as advocated by the Group of Three 
(Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela). 
  The Brazilian position, which is close to that of the Group 
of Three, watches with satisfaction Cuban economic reform, the 
opening toward the Catholic Church, the renovation of the 
Communist Party of Cuba's cadres that has been implemented in 
recent months by Fidel Castro, and the talks held in April by 
Castro's government with opposition groups in exile. 
  Amorim said that these moves may promote democratization, 
which could be jeopardized if Cuba remains isolated. 
  He added: "Perhaps Cuba should make more significant 
gestures. It is more significant to stretch out one's hand than 
to slam the door in someone's face."

  [Text] Belem, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The OAS on 10 June reaffirmed 
its intention to become the "world's most peaceful continent" in 
approving several resolutions that will oblige the 34 member 
countries to control and reduce armaments. 
  During the last session of the 24th Assembly of the OAS, 
which closed today, and by acclamation, the delegations approved 
a resolution by which they commit themselves to fight against 
the proliferation of weapons and to eradicate nuclear tests in 
the continent. 
  A few minutes afterward, upon petition from Canada, the 
Assembly approved another resolution obliging the 34 nations to 
eradicate from the hemisphere the mines that still remain in a 
number of countries where armed conflicts took place, which can 
still cause casualties among the civilian population. 
  According to the Nicaraguan delegation, it will be necessary 
to eradicate some 130,000 mines that remain intact after the 
civil war, and which now indiscriminately threaten the 
campesinos who try to return to their land. 
  In assessing and then closing the OAS Assembly, Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said that "we are the planet's 
most peaceful continent. We do not suffer from external threats 
of a military nature. We consider it important to continue to 
develop measures to strengthen confidence in the most diverse 
spheres in our process of pledged cooperation." 
  The resolutions that were approved today by the delegations, 
which have been meeting since 6 June in the Amazon city of Belem 
do Para, in northern Brazil, are contained within the spirit of 
the so-called Declaration of Belem, which was signed on 7 June 
by the foreign ministers of the member countries. 
  In the declaration the foreign ministers of the OAS member 
countries express "their determination to continue to contribute 
toward achieving the international community's objective of 
overall and complete disarmament under efficient international 
control." 
  The document adds that an attempt to reach this objective 
should be made "through efforts leading to the reduction and 
elimination of weapons of mass destruction, and through making 
it easier to switch dual-purpose materiel and technologies to 
peaceful purposes." 
  Through the first resolution, which was approved today by 
the 
plenum of the General Assembly, the region's countries promise 
to avoid the proliferation of all kinds of weapons of mass 
destruction in order to achieve peace and world security. 
  With this decision the OAS members are obliged to support 
the 
efforts of the United Nations and the negotiations of the 
Disarmament Conference in favor of the "objective of overall and 
complete disarmament under efficient international control." 
  They also promise to support "the quick approval of a treaty 
on the complete banning of nuclear tests." 
  The United States, which is the only country that signed the 
treaty and also carries out nuclear tests, has declared a 
unilateral moratorium on the practice, but has threatened to 
again carry out tests if other countries do not stop theirs. 
  The resolution on limiting the proliferation of weapons 
urges 
the region's countries that have not yet done so to adhere -- as 
it is appropriate -- to the binding international treaties on 
the prohibition and nonproliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
  The agreements to which the document refers are: the Treaty 
for the Proscription of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, or the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, that was signed in 1967; the 1970 Treaty on 
the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons; and the 1925 Geneva 
Protocol, which proscribes bacteriological weapons and the use 
of toxic asphyxiant gases in times of war. 
  "We reject weapons of mass destruction. The signing of the 
Tlatelolco Treaty by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile confirms South 
America as a non-nuclear area. We hope that the American states 
that have not yet signed (the Treaty of) Tlatelolco will do so 
as soon as possible. Our objective is overall and complete 
disarmament," said Amorim, who presided over the OAS General 
Assembly. 
  The ratification of the resolution on the nonproliferation 
of 
weapons will oblige the member countries to sign the UN 
conventions on banning the development, production, and storage, 
and on the destruction of bacteriological and toxic weapons and 
of chemical weapons, signed in 1972 and 1993 respectively. 
  In addition, the member countries approved another 
resolution 
committing themselves to being very clear-cut in their 
negotiations regarding conventional weapons.

  [Text] Belem, 10 Jun (AE) -- The 24th OAS General Assembly 
has concluded with the approval of the Declaration of Belem do 
Para. The OAS has now turned its attention to the Summit of the 
Americas, organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton for December 
in Washington [as received] with the participation of all the 
chiefs of state and government of the hemisphere. The main 
subject of the summit has yet to be announced. Brazilian 
Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said today he expects the summit 
will produce concrete measures to strengthen Inter-American 
cooperation and to enhance social development. 
  In his closing speech to the 24th OAS general assembly, 
Amorim described the results of the deliberations in Belem as 
"extremely encouraging," especially in the field of human 
rights. He called the attention of the plenary to the "deep 
social difficulties that affect broad sectors" of the Latin 
American community and to the "serious economic problems" that 
challenge their governments. After admitting that there are no 
easy answers to such problems, he spoke of the need "for a real 
partnership for development that includes free trade, increased 
financial inflow, and total access to state-of-the-art 
technologies." 
  The OAS secretary general made a resume of the results of 
the 
assembly, recalling one of the most important points of the 
final declaration: The document begins by stating the firm 
commitment of the OAS to become the main hemispheric forum of 
political understanding, and thus "promote and consolidate 
peace, democracy, social justice, and development" in the 
Americas. 
  The Declaration of Belem reasserts the OAS commitment to 
contribute to the prompt and total implementation of the 
decisions agreed during the Uruguay Round of the GATT so as to 
reestablish a non-discriminatory, fair, and multilateral open 
trade system to effectively support efforts toward the total 
development of the countries of the continent. He reasserted 
the commitment of the OAS to intensify cooperation in the 
economic, social, educational, cultural, technological, and 
political fields; to study measures, within the juridical 
framework of each country, seeking to combat corruption and 
improve the efficiency of public administration; to continue to 
promote the Common Market of Knowledge [Mercado Comun do 
Conhecimento] (Mercocyt) as an instrument to share experiences 
and progress among OAS member countries; to strengthen 
cooperation and thus make drug enforcement efforts more 
efficient; and to contribute as much as possible toward the 
success of the Summit of the Americas organized by the U.S. 
President. 
  Celso Amorim took the opportunity to encourage those member 
countries that have yet to sign the Tlatelolco Treaty -- to 
denuclearize Latin America -- to do so as soon as possible to 
thus inspire other regions of the world to support the idea of 
global disarmament. Finally, after briefly referring to the 
efforts to restore democracy in Haiti where the OAS expects to 
carry out its 25th General Assembly, the Brazilian foreign 
minister highlighted the importance of the friendly atmosphere 
created by the foreign ministers and chiefs of delegations in 
Belem. Amorim's final words were: "We have achieved challenging 
works and obtained a positive balance. I think everyone has the 
feeling of having fulfilled his duty."

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F>
"Doing Radio" program] 
  [Text] As we have been reporting on this braodcast of the 
"Doing Radio" program, yesterday, demonstrations were held in 
Washington to protest the U.S. blockade against Cuba. 
Approximately 100 business, intellectual, as well as many other 
organizations participated in this demonstration. In essence, 
Congressman Charles Rangel as well as other political figures, 
intellectuals, and businessmen believe that maintaining the 
blockade is an ill-fated remnant of the Cold War which punishes 
the Cuban people and hampers legitimate interests of U.S. firms, 
who are interested in trading with Cuba. 
  Among other reasons, they argue the fact that the United 
States maintains good trade relations with two socialist nations 
with which it fought in the past: China and Vietnam. The truth 
is that if someone expects to find a reason -- even from the 
most radical perspective of extreme conservatism -- to justify 
the existence of the blockade, it would be difficult for that 
individual to find an intelligent reason that does not 
contradict the agreements on trade, such as the latest one 
within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade, or principles of the UN Charter, which sustain 
international rights. 
  Each day, two arguments gain force in the heart of U.S. 
society, one being of an ethical nature and the other of 
legitimate interests. The first points out that it is unfair, 
with or without political reasons, to punish an entire people, 
who only want peace and respect for their decisions regarding 
domestic policy. The other argument is linked to legitimate 
interests of U.S. businessmen who see in Washington's 
unwillingness to authorize them to trade in and with Cuba a 
serious hindrance to their legitimate business interests. 
  I have just learned, to give an example, that the Texaco 
Corporation is interested in participating in exploration and 
drilling for oil in Cuba, under the same conditions as the 
European, Canadian, and Latin American firms. Other sectors, 
such as the food, pharmaceutical, tourist, and airline, as well 
as many other industries -- a long list which would be 
embarrassing to read -- do not want to be excluded from the 
opportunity of doing business in Cuba due to a prohibition by 
Washington, a prohibition basically supported by political 
stubbornness.

<F P=106> [Station commentary on the "National Radio News" program] </F>
  [Text] A brief analysis on the 24th General Assembly of the 
OAS, just hours after its conclusion, is inescapable at this 
time. For five days, foreign ministers from 34 countries of this 
hemisphere gathered at the Amazon city of Belem do Para to 
discuss two issues that centered the debates: finding a peaceful 
solution to the Haitian crisis and creating a common market for 
free trade in South America. Other issues that weighed on the 
OAS foreign ministers' agenda were issues that range from 
hemispheric security to the risks of collapse that democracies 
of this region are faced with due to a social uprising which is 
motivated by extreme poverty. 
  From the very beginning of the assembly, a topic which was 
not included on the agenda occupied the attention of Joao Baena 
Soares, outgoing secretary general of the OAS, and Brazilian 
Pesident Itamar Franco. We are referring to the demand of Cuba's 
reincorporation into the OAS. In that sense, the call by Baena 
Soares and Franco was expressed to examine the possiblility of 
Cuba's reintegration. Baena's exhortation immediately opened a 
debate in which Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, and Venezuela 
pronounced themselves in favor of finding a formula that would 
put an end to Cuba's isolation in the OAS. But, once again, U.S. 
arrogance was felt when it said there first had to be political 
reforms on this island that would merit the approval of the U.S. 
Government. 
  While this was taking place at the OAS General Assembly, 
dozens of demonstrators gathered in front of the Teatro de la 
Paz to demand the end of the U.S. economic blockade on Cuba. 
The U.S. representation was unable to stop the insistent demand.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Amalia San Martino] </F>
  [Text] [Words indistinct] Haiti, a small, poor nation where 
a group of ambitious coupist soldiers are stubbornly defying the 
international community without caring in the least about the 
consequences of the absurd challenge that will be suffered by an 
innocent and hungry people. 
  The tragic Haitian crisis has gone through many phases. 
While 
the needs and suffering of thousands of people are reaching a 
critical stage, the different options attempting to force the 
military from power have not caused them to relinquish the 
positions they took by force. 
  Those who claim that Haiti, the poorest country in the 
Western Hemisphere, has been reduced to the status of an 
economic outcast due to the all-out trade blockade imposed last 
year by the UN Security Council are not exaggerating. That 
measure was added to the blockade of fuel shipments taken in 
October 1993 -- the only measure the international community 
found to oppose the resistance of the military regime that has 
refused to allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
  It should be noted that, in addition to taking power by 
force, the Haitian military is as, or perhaps even more, 
savagely repressive than the Duvalier dictatorship. They have 
proved to be liars and have not kept their word because they 
broke an agreement signed in July 1993 in New York in which they 
promised to return control of the country to deposed President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While the human rights situation in 
Haiti grows worse and repression reaches frightening levels, 
Haitians must also endure power and water shortages and watch 
the price of medicines -- when they are available -- go sky 
high. But the coupists turn their back upon this harsh reality. 
They continue to travel in lavish automobiles that are 
air-conditioned to counter the tropical heat. Despite all the 
measures taken against them, the Haitian military has not shown 
signs of fearing any of the consequences, not even when faced 
with rumors of an impending invasion by foreign troops -- an 
argument that has gathered strength in the last few days as an 
extreme option to try to settle the crisis. 
  It must be said, however, that far from being a solution, 
the 
use of troops in Haiti would worsen the crisis. An invasion, 
regardless of how it is accomplished, represents a form of 
trampling on the rights of a people and a very serious attack on 
a country's sovereignty. [Words indistinct] as in the case of 
Panama. The interference in the internal affairs of a country 
would be a tacit admission of failure to reach a peaceful 
solution. Perhaps the astute Haitian soldiers are taking this 
into account and that is why they continue to defy the 
international community, which in any event must continue its 
attempts to make this coupist group, which is also accused of 
drug trafficking and illegal enrichment, come to its senses. 
  At the recent opening of the 24th OAS Conference in Belem, 
Para State, Brazil, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide said quick, 
determined action must be taken to remove the coupists from 
power in keeping with the Governors Island Agreement signed in 
July 1993. While this issue is being debated within the OAS, OAS 
Secretary General Joao Baena Soares urged the use of peaceful 
means to solve the Haitian crisis and said that, even though 
these peace efforts might be very difficult, it will always be 
better than fostering a foreign invasion, which would set a 
terrible precedent.

  [Text] Commander in Chief Fidel Castro Ruz has written 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria expressing Cuba's solidarity 
and condolences following the natural disaster there at the 
beginning of the week. This was announced by Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who added that the letter also 
expressed the Cuban Government's willingness to send doctors and 
specialists to Colombia if needed. 
  Alfonso said the Foreign Ministry is pleased with recent 
statements by the Latin American Economic System -- SELA -- and 
the Nonaligned Movement [NAM] rejecting the 30-year-old U.S. 
Government blockade of Cuba. Alfonso pointed out that SELA's 3 
June decision marked the first time that this organization had 
made a statement against the blockade. Alfonso explained that 
the NAM statement was much stronger than on previous occasions 
in that it specifically advocated the UN General Assembly 
resolutions against the blockade. 
  Alfonso also mentioned the rallies several U.S. 
organizations 
held in Washington and other U.S. cities on 9 June in support of 
the bill to lift the U.S. blockade which legislator Charles 
Rangel presented before Congress and other U.S. political and 
federal entities.

  [Text] Today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered its 
security forces to free Russia from criminals and pointed out 
that ministers will be personally responsible for the success or 
the failure of the new measures. During a news conference held 
at the Kremlin, on the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the 
declaration of Russia's sovereignty, Yeltsin said that crime has 
become Russia's scourge. President Yeltsin added that his 
government has adopted a new plan to fight criminal 
organizations, which, as he said, are infiltrating the nation's 
economy and attempting to infiltrate the political sector as 
well. 
  A true crime wave has affected Russian since last year, 
especially in Moscow, where criminal organizations have 
connections. Yeltsin described these organizations as the 
criminal garbage that is attempting to spread throughout the 
country.

progress has been made in Cuban relations and the expansion of 
those ties would be feasible. Frei met at La Moneda Palace with 
a group of foreign reporters who asked him questions on Chile's 
foreign policy and issues of national interest. 
  Responding to reporters' questions on his next encounter 
with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro on the occasion of the fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, the 
Chilean leader stated that the consolidation of bilateral 
relations would be analyzed at the meeting. With regard to this, 
he said that a lot of progress has been made and that those 
relations can be strengthened. He added that this would be in 
harmony with strengthening of democracy and the respect for 
human rights, which are fundamental values for Chile.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry neither confirmed nor denied a report on an agreement 
that would be signed in Havana on 13 June whereby a Mexican 
corporation would invest $1.5 billion in Cuba. This would be 
the largest foreign capital investment in the country in 35 
years. 
  According to reports from Mexico, the corporation Domos 
International would buy 49 percent of the state-owned Cuban 
Telecommunications Enterprise [Empresa Cubana de 
Telecomunicaciones, ETEC] for 1.5 billion through a document to 
be signed during Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's 
visit to Havana next Monday. 
  In Mexico City, one of Domos International's executives said 
the investment is endorsed by British corporations N.M. 
Rothschild and K.P.M.G. Peat Marwick. 
  Asked about the matter, Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Miguel Alfonso said he could neither confirm nor deny whether 
the signing of the document is included on the agenda, which has 
been prepared for the Mexican president's visit. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1620 GMT on 10 June reports that 
according to Pedro Sepulveda, Domos International's corporate 
director, the corporation will buy 49 percent of ETEC for $1.5 
billion next week. Press dispatches report the operation will 
include a seven-year plan of modernization that will cost $720 
million, and the agreement will be signed during Salinas' visit. 
The report adds that ETEC comprises all of Cuba's telephone 
services, excluding cellular telephones. The project includes 
replacing 200,000 of the system's existing 450,000 lines and 
expanding the system to one million lines and is endorsed by 
N.M. Rothschild, a leading bank in telecommunications 
advisership, and K.P.M.G. Peat Marwick, an auditor's enterprise 
that backed the feasibility studies]

Central Committee and first secretary of the Communist Party of 
Cuba [PCC] in the province, and other provincial authorities. 
  The delegation toured the Camilo Cienfuegos Refinery during 
a 
visit to the industrial park. The refinery is nearly completed 
and has already been producing for the last three years. The 
plant could benefit from an investment that would increase its 
efficiency. The delegation also visited the Juragua Nuclear 
Plant, where they were told that construction is temporarily 
halted but that the facility has been preserved. The delegation 
was also informed that negotiations recently got underway to 
form an economic association that will make it possible to 
complete the plant and start operations. 
  The delegation also met higher education teachers and 
students in the province. The delegation will visit Matanzas 
Province on 11 June and is scheduled to depart Cuba on 12 June. 
  This is the highest ranking PRC delegation to visit Cuba 
since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit.

  [Text] Wu Banggou, CPC Politburo member and CPC secretary 
general in Shanghai, appeared to be very happy with his visit to 
Cuba, which continued this afternoon in Matanzas Province. Wu 
Banggou and his delegation were accompanied by Politburo member 
Yadira Garcia, first secretary of the party in Matanzas 
Province, on a tour during which they learned of the 
developments in the tourist and oil industry programs. At the 
Melia Varadero Hotel, the delegation was informed of the profits 
made by this and other joint capital enterprises, as well as the 
basis and characteristics for this type of business. 
  Cuba's largest producing oil field lies near Varadero Beach. 
The oil field's workers have an annual production goal of 
930,000 tons, nearly 75 percent of Cuba's production goal. Work 
is aimed at surpassing this goal. Wu Banggou was informed of 
the joint operations with Canadian and French companies and the 
progress in the program designed to increase production and

<F P=106> [Decree-Law 149. On the Confiscation of Property </F>
and Income Acquired Through Illegal Means] 
  [Text] 
  I, Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Council of State of 
the 
Republic of Cuba 
  HEREBY PROCLAIM: That the Council of State has approved the 
following: 
  WHEREAS: The National Assembly of People's Power, in its 
session of May 1 and 2, 1994, being the first special session of 
the fourth legislature, responding to the demands of the 
majority of our people, agreed to recommend that the Council of 
State with all due speed adopt effective and deterrent measures 
against those who acquire property illegally, accumulating 
wealth and material goods which, far from being the fruit of 
their honest labor, are the result of theft, speculation, 
diversion of resources belonging to state entities or other 
official bodies, engaging in shady dealings, black market 
activities and other forms of accumulating wealth which damage 
the most vital interests of our society; 
  WHEREAS: The above mentioned activities tend to foster all 
types of criminal activities, with resulting damage to the 
domestic economy and the country's social stability, and are 
particularly damaging in the situation resulting from special 
period in peacetime, since their demoralizing effect is 
incompatible with the determination to stand firm and the 
selfless sacrifice of our people, faced with the historic 
challenge of saving the country and the Revolution; 
  WHEREAS: The Constitution of the Republic in Article 60 
states that confiscation of property is only to be applied as a 
punishment by the authorities in those cases and according to 
proceedings established by law, and whereas Article 61 of the 
Constitution allows for the retroactive application of non-penal 
laws when it is thus established in those laws for reasons of 
social interest or because it is useful for public purposes; 
  THEREFORE: The Council of State, exercising the powers that 
have been invested in it by clause c) of Article 90 of the 
Constitution of the Republic, approves the following. 
<H5>  Decree-Law 149 </H5>
<H5>  On the Confiscation of Property and Income Acquired by </H5>
Illegal Means 
  Article 1. -- The confiscation of and subsequent 
appropriation by the Cuban state are hereby authorized, with no 
right of indemnity, of property and income acquired by persons 
who either directly or through third parties increase their 
property illegally and in a manner disproportionate to their 
legitimate income. 
  Article 2. -- The minister of finance and prices 
shall have the power, by virtue of his own decision, to punish 
by confiscating property and income in those cases referred to 
in this Decree-Law. 
  Article 3. -- The Attorney General's Office of the 
Republic will have all the legal powers and authority necessary 
to carry out investigations and substantiate the confiscation 
process, acting on its own initiative on the basis of any 
information it may obtain in this matter. 
  Article 4. -- The confiscation process will be 
directed against the owner, possessor or holder of the property 
and income referred to in this Decree-Law, including those 
belonging to third parties who may benefit from them, and 
against anyone who is falsely listed as the owner. 
  Article 5. -- The prosecutor, in line with the 
results of the preliminary investigation, may issue a decision 
to take precautionary measures in regard to the property and 
income of those under investigation which may be necessary to 
ensure compliance with the provisions of this Decree-Law. 
  There can be no appeal proceeding whatsoever to overturn the 
decree mentioned in the preceding paragraph for the application 
of said precautionary measures. 
  Article 6. -- The prosecutor will decide what 
actions need to be carried out by officials, employees of any 
entity and administrative and public authorities, in order to 
substantiate the case and to implement the precautionary 
measures that have been stipulated and which must be carried out 
in the time period specified. 
  Article 7. -- Once the prosecutor has taken the 
appropriate precautionary measures related to property and 
income, he or she may immediately proceed to draw up a case 
which will be substantiated within a brief period and through 
which those involved can supply documents which prove their 
legal ownership of the aforementioned property and income. 
  Article 8. -- The public prosecutor, in accordance 
with the results of the investigation, will adopt one of the 
following decisions: 
  1. Order the precautionary measures corresponding to goods 
and income, in the case that this has not been done previously, 
and if necessary, ratify or modify the measures already 
dictated, or render them null and void; 
  2. File the case dossier and render the precautionary 
measures null and void, ordering the restitution of the goods 
and income to the proper parties or legitimate owners; 
  3. Present the case before the minister of finance and 
prices 
with the intent to confiscate; or 
  4. Initiate criminal proceedings, independent of the act of 
confiscation, if the results of the investigations lead to the 
belief that a crime has been committed. 
  Article 9. -- Upon receipt of the case dossier, 
the minister of finance and prices will issue the corresponding 
decision, or if necessary, request further information from the 
prosecutor regarding any outstanding details, and once this has 
been completed, issue a decision. 
  The decision issued by the minister of finance and prices 
may 
be appealed by the party concerned. Once the appeal has been 
considered and the final decision made, there will be no 
administrative or judicial recourse whatsoever. 
  In exceptional cases the minister of finance and prices will 
be authorized by the attorney general of the Republic to review 
decisions issued in regard to confiscation. 
<H5>  Special Provision </H5>
  The minister of finance and prices may delegate to other 
officials of the Ministry certain powers granted by this 
Decree-Law, with the exception of the authority to review 
decisions regarding confiscation under exceptional circumstances. 
<H5>  Interim Provision </H5>
  In compliance with the provisions of this Decree-Law and 
until the regulations referred to in the Third Final Provision 
are issued, the prosecutor will commence preliminary 
investigations and, if necessary, adopt the precautionary 
measures regarding goods and income that may be subject to 
confiscation, thus initiating the corresponding proceedings. 
<H5>  Final Provisions </H5>
  FIRST: The provisions of the current Decree-Law will be 
applied retroactively, given its social benefit, public 
usefulness and the national need. 
  SECOND: Any actions aimed at concealing the illicit 
acquisition of goods and income referred to by this Decree-Law 
will be viewed as null and void of judicial validity, as will 
all those aimed at evading its enforcement. 
  THIRD: The Council of Ministers will be responsible for 
dictating the regulations of this Decree-Law, as well as any 
provisions deemed necessary for its enforcement. 
  FOURTH: All laws, decree-laws, decrees and other legal 
provisions contrary to the enforcement of this Decree-Law are 
hereby repealed and this Decree-Law will come into effect upon 
its publication in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba. 
  Signed in the Palace of the Revolution, in Havana, on the 
fourth day of the month of May of the year 1994. 
  Fidel Castro Ruz 
  President 
  Council of State 
  I CERTIFY: That this is a true and exact copy of the 
original 
document, signed on the date noted. 
  Signed: Jose M. Miyar Barrueco 
  Secretary of the Council of State

  [Text] Havana municipal labor directorates have implemented 
several regulations, approved by the provincial administrative 
council, to better control self-employment. The following 
measures have been implemented since May: 

  -  Rent is being 
collected for the use of public areas; 
  -  Monthly fees have been 
increased in 30 categories; 
  -  State entities are authorized to 
utilize this personal [as heard]; 
  -  The production of plastic 
items has been banned. 

  Provincial authorities have determined the amount of rent to 
be collected, which will go directly to the provincial budget, 
according to location. 
  The ban on manufacturing plastic items stems from the 
effects 
that this is having on the national economy due to the misuse of 
that resource.

  [Excerpts] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited Caibarien 
Municipality as part of his continuing tour of Central Army 
areas. The party and government take initiatives there that 
involve the masses when solving problems. 
  The words consistency and determination are no longer theory 
but reality in Caibarien Municipality, north Villa Clara 
Province. Raul saw this during his tour of the area. Major 
Jimenez Vazquez, head of the municipal general staff, briefed 
Raul on the area's level of defense preparedness, the 
territory's political and moral state, and the development of 
the food program with the people's help in solving problems. 
  Caibarien Municipality is recognized as being prepared 
defensively at the second stage for several reasons, including: 
the completion of fortified projects, the detailed preparation 
of the cadres in the six defense zones, the authorization of the 
warning system, and the ability to transport in case of enemy 
attack. Defense Day was completed successfully with specialists 
giving practical and theoretical classes. Furthermore, 
Caibarien is contributing more to the territorial militia in 
preparation for combat. The municipality has perfected the 
Unified Vigilance and Protection System and the equipment and 
armaments are ready to be put into action. [passage omitted] 
  Raul and his delegation met workers at the municipal organic 
gardens -- the most outstanding in the province -- where he was 
able to see developments in the production of vegetables and 
tubers for the population. Raul expressed his satisfaction when 
he saw the good political and moral state of those workers, who 
labor every day with great responsibility. [passage omitted] 
  The tour through Caibarien included a visit to the Campanas 
de las Villas contingent, which is working on the Caibarien-Cayo 
Santa Maria embankment. A total of 42 kilometers have already 
been completed. Orlando Rodriguez, head of the contingent, 
explained the progress made on the project, the collective's 
experiences, and the fuel-saving initiatives and innovations. 
Construction on the embankment is top quality and is being 
carried out with environmental protection in mind. 
  Access to the beaches of Villa Clara's northern keys will 
help develop the Cuban tourist industry. Raul was interested in 
touring the completed portion of the embankment, particularly 
the embankment's new bridge. Raul conversed with the workers en 
route to the project and encouraged them to continue. Raul was 
amazed by the magnificent project and posed for a photograph 
with the workers and his delegation at the end of the embankment 
as a souvenir of his visit. This project, devised by our 
commander in chief, demonstrates how man can overcome any 
obstacle regardless of difficulty.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro stated that the Cuban 
people face a difficult struggle and that their long journey has 
not yet concluded. After pointing out that only in the last 35 
years have we been owners of our destiny, Raul warned that now 
we must begin all over again and there is no other way. 
Furthermore, he highlighted that even if it were out of respect 
for our dead, we must be loyal and firm. 
  Raul, who is second secretary of the party and minister of 
the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], spoke to pilots of the 
Antiaircraft Defense and Revolutionary Air Force [DAAFAR] 
brigade in Santa Clara, after visiting the Central Army's air 
base. Raul also visited the daycare center and the elementary 
school of that military community. 
  The exposition presented by Brigadier General Nilvio 
Sanchez, 
head of that unit, demonstrated how all of its air and antiair 
units are being protected and are ready for combat, or are being 
preserved and are ready to be taken out of the bowels of the 
earth and put into action within little time. 
  In the same manner, Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, 
first vice minister of the FAR, underscored that such a high 
level in the condition of the equipment had never been obtained 
before, which responds to the capacity developed by Cuban 
specialists to repair and maintain even the most complex 
equipment. Ruben Martinez, head of the DAAFAR, added that $13 
million had been saved in airplane engine repairs alone last 
year. 
  During his tour, Raul was also able to witness the intense 
labor carried out at the Victoria de Santa Clara 
agricultural-livestock farm and how all the resources of a large 
tank unit in Villa Clara are being maintained and properly 
protected.

  [Text] Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], has visited a firing range and 
agrarian units in Villa Clara Province as part of his continuing 
tour of the Central Army region. He was welcomed by Tomas 
Cardenas, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] 
in Villa Clara Province. 
  First, Raul visited the Corralillo farming-military district 
and the Central Army firing range. He was briefed on the 
program to increase rice production and develop the cattle 
industry, fish farms, and reforestation efforts. 
  Colonel Ciro Gomez Betancourt, chief of the Army Studies 
Center, gave a briefing on the results of the training period, 
during which the projected maneuvers and exercises were 
conducted successfully. This has helped maintain the troops' 
high combat-readiness level despite the current shortage of 
resources. Raul insisted that every officer and soldier must 
realize the cost of every maneuver, exercise, projectile, or any 
other military resource, as well as develop self-sufficiency 
efforts to guarantee the food demands of the troops. 
  Reserve Lieutenant Colonel Rolando Ramos, chief of the 
agrarian district, told Raul of his goal to plant 34 caballerias 
of rice and to become self-sufficient in rice for 1995. He 
noted efforts to breed bulls for Army ox teams as well as 
efforts on fish farms, which they hope will cover 20 hectares 
this year. They hope to produce 30 tons of honey and other 
highly priced byproducts through beekeeping, as well as 300 tons 
of charcoal from Marabu, which is abundant in this coastal 
region. 
  Raul also visited the Central Army's microjet plantain farm, 
in Santo Domingo Municipality. Raul was pleased with the 
progress made on land cleared by the soldiers by hand and with 
dynamite and irrigated with water from the Alacranes reservoir. 
Raul also congratulated farm chief Ariel Pena for the results 
attained and asked him to personally report to him on fulfilling 
his goal by year's end. The farm workers work hard to remove 
weeds, which have multiplied since the May rains. 
  Raul also visited the (Agrofar) Center, an entity attached 
to 
the military agrarian union. It supplies seed to FAR farms and 
trains personnel and helps with research and ways to replace 
imports and increase export resources. Center Director Antonio 
Rodriguez gave a briefing on efforts to ensure that the FAR gets 
quality seed since 50 percent of the agricultural yield depends 
on this. Antonio is the son of well-know researcher Adolfo 
Rodriguez, 87, who was a pioneer in agamic seeds research, which 
is the cornerstone of a broad movement responsible for the 
quality of Cuban agriculture: 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] The Army will eat the beans it 
produces or it will eat no beans at all. Your efforts will not 
be lost because they will continue through this bloodline. The 
children and grandchildren must be introduced to this affair. 
  [Adolfo Rodriguez] Yes. I also have grandchildren who will 
be here soon enough. The comrades tell me they hope to see a 
movement of seeds alone or otherwise we will have nothing to put 
on the ground. [end recording] 
  Raul was also interested in seeing the center's production 
section. He praised its leaders and workers and stressed the 
need for every agricultural leader to visit this center and 
learn from its valuable experience. 
  [Begin Castro recording] This place is a gem. Let us work 
faster toward its completion. [end recording]

  [Excerpt] Army General Raul Castro continues to tour the 
Central Army region. On this occasion he visited areas of the 
Victoria de Giron Citrus Enterprise in Jaguey Grande, Matanzas 
Province. Raul and his companions visited farm number 2 of 
Jaguey's citrus program. The delegation held a meeting with 
Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan, member of the Politburo; 
provincial party leaders, enterprise managers; and the general 
staff of the 102d Division of the Youth Labor Army [EJT]. 
  In the meeting, an agreement was reached to incoporate 
citrus 
plantations into EJT farms, which have already demonstrated 
their efficiency in this region and other parts of Cuba. The 
EJT already manages six of the 10 farms of the enterprise, the 
remaining four will be put under EJT control later in the year.

  [Text] A member of the Diosmedes Jimenez volunteer 
cane-cutting brigade from Niquero Municipality in Granma, sent a 
letter to Army General Raul Castro, minister of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], informing him that they had 
concluded the sugar harvest with a total of 3.2 million arrobas 
of sugarcane. This is the only collective from Cuban Workers 
Federation's forces to reach the aforementioned figure as was 
announced during a ceremony chaired by Alfredo Enriquez Pina, 
first secretary of the party in Granma Province, where the 
collective was awarded the three-million arroba banner. The 
newspaper GRANMA reports that this achievement is considered a 
heroic deed, considering the material difficulties of the 
current harvest. The most outstanding members of the brigade -- 
with more than 100,000 arrobas -- were Victor Rodriguez and 
Benigno Hidalgo, and the most outstanding youth was Julio Guerra.

  [Text] Despite the economic limitations that Cuba currently 
faces, the number of retired and pensioned workers supported by 
the social security system has increased in the five years of 
the special period. In today's edition, GRANMA points out that 
this information was provided by Orlando Penate, director of 
Social security of the State Committee for Labor. Penate points 
out that in 1993 Cuba invested more than 1.63 billion pesos in 
social security. This figure represents 4.3 million pesos 
invested in the social sector every 24 hours, which does not 
include the cost of assistance in that sector, which in 1993 was 
approximately 35.9 million pesos. 
  In Cuba, the social security system's equation of 
equilibrium 
is based on the business sector's productivity, and its 
development is determined by the global economy, which means 
that greater efficiency is required from the business sector.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Today, Dominican 
Cardinal Nicolas Lopez Rodriguez criticized the presence of U.S. 
soldiers to monitor compliance with the UN embargo on Haiti 
along the land border that separates the two countries. 
  Since 7 June, 12 officers of the U.S. Atlantic Command have 
been at the Haitian border to help Dominican border troops 
prevent primarily the smuggling of gasoline from the Dominican 
Republic. Haiti, with 9 million inhabitants, and the Dominican 
Republic with close to 8 million, share the Caribbean island of 
Hispaniola. 
  "If it is true they are here, they should not stay here 
long," Cardinal Lopez Rodriguez commented upon leaving a church 
at the end of a service to bless new parish members. Monsignor 
Lopez Rodriguez criticized the policy the United Nations and the 
United States have followed up to now to remove the military who 
control Haiti, adding that "it seems those people do not 
understand the situation." 
  "It seems to me we do not need meddling," the Dominican 
cardinal also said. He added that he is opposed to the 
reinstatement of toppled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. "Those people starving to death are not to blame for 
what is happening," the cardinal said. 
  He commented the desirable thing would be for the United 
Nations to promote a peace plan "that involves nations, not 
states because there is justified concern over the United States 
in Latin America."

    [Editorial report] Port-au-Prince Television Nationale 
d'Haiti in French at 1635 GMT on 12 June carries a 20-minute 
recorded address to the nation by provisional President Emile 
Jonassaint. Jonassaint speaks in both French and Creole during 
the address. 
  Jonassaint begins, in French: "Men and women of my country: 
I have decided to address the nation tonight. It is a serious 
moment. Haiti, our country, is in great danger. Reviled, 
ridiculed, humiliated, and strangled, Haiti risks invasion and 
occupation." 
  Jonassaint says that history, the Constitution, and deep 
Haitian values prevent him from giving in to threats and that he 
is pushed to defend the imperiled fatherland and that it will be 
defended. 
  He calls on the people to mobilize to defend the country: "I 
solemnly declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not 
submit to orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have 
demanded and have obtained the provisional government's word 
that it will take all measures to ensure our survival as an 
independent and fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of 
emergency [etat d'urgence] is declared. A series of government 
measures will go into effect immediately. I order the Haitian 
Armed Forces commander in chief to guard against all 
possibilities." 
  Jonassaint then deplores the fact that some Haitians have 
demanded that foreigners invade Haiti and calls on the people to 
remain calm and attend to their daily affairs. He urges the 
people to remain mobilized and alert so that they are united and 
determined, "like the ancestors," to struggle to the death in 
ensuring the country's defense before the enemies. 
  He says: "On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those 
nations that have refused to give in to the immorality, the 
arrogance, and the perfidy of a certain international community, 
to those that have relieved us of our misfortunes." 
  Jonassaint then switches to Creole to deliver the rest of 
his 
address, saying: "Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear 
before you today to say a few words as the country is in danger." 
  Jonassaint warns that a giant that can destroy Haiti in five 
minutes has declared war on Haiti, while Haiti has done nothing 
to provoke it. He suggests this is in response to democracy 
coming to Haiti, noting that there has never been democracy in 
Haiti. 
  Referring to President-in-Exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide -- 
without actually mentioning Aristide by name -- Jonassaint 
explains he was a State Council member during the 1990 election, 
that he voted for the candidate whom everybody was voting for, 
and that he is now ashamed of having voted for that candidate 
because that candidate is now asking those he was always 
criticizing to invade Haiti to reduce the country to slavery. 
Jonassaint then makes some historical references and criticizes 
Aristide -- again, without mentioning Aristide by name -- for 
wasting Haiti's money and allowing the United States to use 
Haiti while Haitians starve to death. 
  Jonassaint says that all those who harmed Haiti have 
succumbed and speaks of a president who has asked that Haiti be 
destroyed. He says that president is now in jail for theft, 
adding that others have fallen and that others will fall, that 
they have their own problems in their countries, and that they 
are no more serious than the Haitians. 
  Jonassaint concludes by calling on the people to unite and 
to 
remain mobilized for the defense of the country: "If they 
destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians never fear 
death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at 
parliament. I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or 
death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die, 
or we remain free." 
  At 1655 GMT, Jonassaint ends his address.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint, 
the de facto president of Haiti, today declared a state of 
emergency in the country and ordered coupist General Raoul 
Cedras to take every possible measure to deal with whatever may 
happen. 
  Jonassaint also called on the Haitian people to unite to 
meet 
an invasion. "If we have to die, we will die together," 
Jonassaint said in a message to the people aired at 0130 local 
(0530 GMT) and in which he announced the measures taken. 
  In his message, he strongly criticized the international 
community for the plan to restore democracy in the country and 
the threats of a foreign invasion. Jonassaint said Haiti has 
done nothing wrong to foreigners and that he cannot understand 
the reason for a probable invasion. As for the restoration of 
democracy, he asked: "What democracy are we talking about? 
When did such a democracy exist in Haiti?" 
  Jonassaint accused Jean-Bertrand Aristide of squandering the 
country's wealth by "giving it to the whites." 
  Referring to Aristide's return to Haiti, but without 
mentioning the constitutional president by name, Jonassaint 
said: "If he is that strong, why does he not come alone?" 
  In stating that the Haitians will never accept a return to 
slavery, Jonassaint alluded to Haiti's Independence Act, which 
proclaims "liberty or death." 
  The chief of the de facto government also made reference to 
former Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez, who has been 
imprisoned on charges of embezzlement and theft after having 
been linked to the Haiti case. Jonassaint continued by 
referring to foreign leaders involved in the search for a 
solution to the Haitian crisis, saying: "Soon the others will 
face the same fate." [sentence as received] 
  The Haitian Constitution does not envisage a state of 
emergency, but it does cover conditions for a state of siege. 
Political observers in the Haitian capital believe that the 
declaration of the state of emergency is a disguise for 
establishing a state of siege to restrict the citizens' 
liberties. Because of the time at which Jonassaint's message 
was broadcast, few people have been informed about the de facto 
president's decision, and for this reason, it will be necessary 
to wait until Monday to determine what the reaction will be.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 12 Jun (AFP) -- The declaration of a 
state of emergency in Haiti today by provisional President Emile 
Jonassaint (who is not recognized by the international 
community) is "a reply of firmness and legitimate defense" 
against the U.S. Government, a Jonaissant associate said. 
  This measure and Jonaissant's solemn rejection of yielding 
to 
foreign pressure comes 36 hours after President Bill Clinton's 
announcement that new sanctions will be applied against the 
Caribbean country to force the departure of the Haitian military 
chiefs. 
  The provisional government on Sunday had yet to publish the 
"series of measures" announced by Jonaissant in his 
radio-television speech early this morning, but there is great 
calm in Port-au- Prince, where no special security measures are 
visible. 
  According to the source, the establishment of the state of 
emergency does not have any connection with the murder of a 
soldier near the National Palace 15 days ago. A military 
official, who asked to remain unidentified, blamed the death on 
a guerrilla operation launched from Washington by exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and his supporters. 
  Referring to rumors according to which a group of armed men 
attacked the Army headquarters in this capital in the evening 
last week, the official indicated that it was "a minor incident" 
and that "the shots were apparently accidental." "The incident, 
which did not cause any casualties, was controlled in a few 
minutes by guards, and no bullet holes were found in the 
buildings," he added. 
  Meanwhile, official sources denied rumors about the Haitian 
authorities' possible decision to close the Port-au-Prince 
international airport on 21 June, four days before the 
suspension of flights by the United States and Canada goes into 
effect.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Haitian 
sectors favoring the return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide demanded the resignation of the ruling military leaders 
to prevent a U.S. military invasion. 
  Port-au-Prince Mayor Evans Paul called on General Raoul 
Cedras to step down because, otherwise, "the sanctions will be 
very, very hard on us.... It would be the end of the 
country.... And worse, we are threatened by a military 
invasion." 
  Because of the repression and precarious security situation 
prevailing in Haiti, the Revolutionary Front for the Advance and 
Progress of Haiti [FRAPH], a paramilitary organization 
identified with the Army, has turned against its sponsors. 
  FRAPH leader Louis Jodel Chamblain reported he was the 
victim 
of an attack two days ago. "If I, Chamblain, am not safe, then 
no Haitian can feel safe. No one can speak up in the country. 
It is time to put an end to all this." For this reason, he 
requested the international community's support in guaranteeing 
the safety of all political leaders in the country. 
  The OAS-UN civilian delegation and other international 
organizations blame FRAPH for much of the violence and 
repression against popular organizations and Aristide's 
followers. FRAPH has also been blamed for setting up a 
demonstration in October 1993 to protest the arrival of the USS 
Harlan County, which was carrying the first contingent of UN 
Mission for Haiti military technicians. 
  Wednesday night, the Army demonstrated it is powerless to 
ensure even its own security, when 10 men broke into Army 
Headquarters and staged a shoot-out with the soldiers on duty. 
The individuals succeeded in escaping from the military 
installation, and none of them were arrested. A report of the 
incident said the men "displayed military training and 
knowledge." 
  According to unofficial reports, most of the soldiers fled 
from the police quarters across the street from Army 
Headquarters as soon as they heard about the incident. One 
source said: "All of the policemen fled in civilian clothing and 
without weapons. They had no intention of defending either 
their quarters or their posts." 
  Several observers on the island noted that, if the military 
cannot keep a small group of men from attacking its own 
installations, "what could it possibly do against the Marines?"

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jacques Maurice] </F>
  [Text] A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Port-au-Prince told AFP 
on 9 June that the U.S. Embassy might ask U.S. citizens living 
in Haiti and families of diplomatic personnel to leave the 
country. The spokesman pointed out that if the Clinton 
administration decides to ban commercial flights between the 
United States and Haiti, the families of diplomatic personnel 
would have to leave this country and other U.S. nationals would 
have to be put on alert. 
  President Bill Clinton is expected to announce new sanctions 
against the Caribbean republic on 10 June. The same source 
explained that the sanctions could include banning commercial 
flights and bank transfers with the United States. By the 
evening of 9 June, the White House had not confirmed that the 
U.S. President would make such a statement on 10 June. The U.S. 
spokesman added that the United States is in touch with 
diplomats in other countries on the sanctions. 
  Less than 100 people continue to work at the U.S. Embassy in 
Port-au-Prince. Their dependents, including women and children, 
total 70. Fewer than 6,000 U.S. citizens live in Haiti, 
including those of Haitian origin and 600 U.S. tourists who, 
among other things, are visiting their families, the U.S. 
Embassy told AFP. 
  American Airlines, which serves Miami and New York from 
Port-au-Prince daily, has advised Haitian travel agencies that 
it will add a daily flight to Miami 16-22 June. Miami is also 
served by Haiti Trans Air and ALM, of the Dutch West Indies. 
Both have four weekly flights. ALM also links Haiti to Curacao 
four times a week. Copa serves Panama City from Port-au-Prince 
twice a week. Air Canada links Montreal to Port-au-Prince. Air 
France serves Paris via Pointe-a-Pitres three times a week and 
links the Haitian capital to Santo Domingo, in neighboring 
Dominican Republic.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Tonight through its 
internal telecommunications network, the Canadian Embassy will 
recommend that Canadian citizens who do not have specific 
reasons for staying in the country after 25 June leave Haiti, a 
Canadian embassy spokesman told AFP. "The final decision will 
have to be made by each individual, however," the source said. 
  Today, the government of Ottawa joined the U.S. position by 
announcing that flights from Canada to Haiti will be suspended 
as of 25 June. The source added that the embassy had expressed 
a similar position twice in the past two years but that numerous 
Canadians, some of whom had been living in Haiti for 30 or 40 
years, had elected to stay. 
  According to the embassy, 2,400 Canadians, most of them 
holding double nationality, live in Haiti. These people include 
some 300 male and female religious teachers, most of whom come 
from Quebec province.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 11 Jun (EFE) -- Today, the 
organization known as "Capois-La-Mort," which includes 
high-ranking extreme right-wing soldiers, demanded strict 
measures against foreigners and the closure of the 
Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitiene airports. In addition, they 
demanded an end to diplomatic relations with France, Canada, 
Venezuela, and the United States and declared the ambassadors of 
these countries persona non grata. According to their demands, 
no foreign airplanes should be allowed to land at the Haitian 
capital or at any other airport. 
  The demands were listed in a communique issued today. Among 
other things, the document asks for border officials to ban the 
entry of foreigners crossing the Dominican Republic border. The 
document also demands cutting off water, power, and telephone 
services to foreign embassies and those "collaborating with the 
enemy." 
  The military group suggests and even demands giving the 
French, Canadian, Venezuelan, and U.S. ambassadors 48 hours to 
leave Haiti. If they choose to remain in the country, the group 
recommends limiting their movements as well as the movements of 
other diplomatic representatives, consuls, and members of 
international agencies. 
  They call for ambassadors and other foreign government 
officials to be ordered to remain within a 15 km radius of their 
official domicile. According to the communique outlining the 
special measures, in order for these people to travel outside 
the said 15 km perimeter, they must first get approval from the 
Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Armed Forces. 
  "Capois-La-Mort" considers the strict sanctions ordered 
against the country and backed by the international community, 
as "a declaration of war against the black Republic of Haiti." 
The organization urges the government to approve special "war 
measures," to enable it to respond to the "foreign aggression." 
  The written demands presented by "Capois-La-Mort" come while 
rumors of a foreign military invasion of Haiti spread. 
Observers see the demands as evidence that the military and its 
collaborators could take extreme measures.

  [Text] For his part, Chamber of Deputies President Frantz 
Robert Monde, who has socialist ties, very keenly condemned the 
latest sanctions taken by Mr. Clinton, saying that it is a 
racist, irrational, and unprecedented decision. 
  [Begin Monde recording] The international community's 
strategy is aimed at punishing the people who voted for 
Aristide. As I, Frantz Robert Monde, deputy, do not receive 
money transfers; as for you, you do not receive transfers; who 
receives transfers? It is those who had the chance to leave by 
boat; it is someone who made an effort to buy a visa, it 
is someone who made an effort... [pauses] who was working, saved 
some money, and then left. It is those people who are sending 
$150-200 to their families so they can live. 
  But you condemn those little people to live on only $50 per 
month. I want the U.S. Government to tell me if the poorest 
U.S. citizen can live on an income of $50 a week? This is a 
racist and irrational decision which does not take the faintest 
notion of humanitarianism into account. This is unprecedented. 
I went to Washington and negotiated with them. We 
agreed on the conditions under which General Cedras would step 
down. The problems of Gen. Biamby Colonel Michel Francois were 
out of the question. They agreed with me, but have decided 
today that the entire Army high command should step down. When 
one says high command, one implicitly says the department 
commanders as well. Why? For Father Aristide? It is not 
true, my dear. You must remember that when they entered 
the country in 1915, they destroyed an existing police 
corps in order to create the National Guard. Now, they say: Let 
us destroy the Haitian Army which is a pure offspring of the 
National Guard in order to create a police corps. In fact, let 
us imagine that Aristide returns, that the Americans arrive in 
the country, and that soldiers are going to be killed. Do you 
think they will sit idly by? It is a [word indistinct] 
political obligation for the Army high command to have a defense 
plan. [end recording]

  [Text] The provisional government of Judge Emile Jonassaint 
signed an agreement with the Vatican for a grant of $32 million. 
The minister of information, culture, and coordination informs 
the nation that following approaches made by Haitian Foreign 
Minister Dr. Charles Antony David, the agreement was signed in 
Italy on 27 May 1994 between the representatives of the 
provisional government of Haiti and the state of the Vatican. 
The terms of the agreement are that Haiti will receive 75 
thousands metric tonnes of hard wheat worth $32 million. 
  The Ministry of Information note asserts that Judge Emile 
Jonassaint, provisional president of the Republic, putting 
himself in the role of the interpreter of the entire Haitian 
people who are subjected to a criminal embargo and an 
unjustified blockade, thanked the state of the Vatican and the 
Holy Father John Paul II for the great understanding and 
solicitude. At a time when the international community, 
practicing systematic disinformation, misrepresents the Haitian 
realities and shows a total misunderstanding of the drama that 
the Haitian population faces, the generous gesture of the 
Vatican comforts us and confirms for us the permanence of the 
Christian values of truth, honesty, and justice, continues the 
note from the Ministry of Information. The note adds in 
conclusion that the Haitian people will always remember 
gratefully that in the horrifying agony that has fallen on the 
country -- on Haitian men, women, children, and elders -- the 
state of the Vatican offered its hand in order to relieve their 
material and moral sufferings and allowing them to survive with 
dignity.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Edner Jean on Commerce Minister </F>
Jean-Robert Delsoin's appearance before the Senate headed by 
Senator Bernard Sansaricq in Port-au-Prince on 9 June; passages 
within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] [Jean] Economic sanctions have reduced the Commerce 
Ministry's duties to having to supply the local market with 
essential foods -- such as rice, sugar, and flour -- and 
medicine on a regular and permanent basis. 
  Rice: Delsoin pointed out that it is important not only to 
supply the local market with quality rice in sufficient amounts 
but also to protect and encourage national production while 
assuring a reasonable retail price. To help bring down the 
retail price of imported rice, the commerce minister suggests 
luring traditional importers into ordering in groups and urging 
them to apply to the Finance Ministry for customs rights on an 
inclusive basis of 12.50 gourdes per sack instead of the ad 
valorem tax of 40 percent currently in effect. 
  Sugar: One of the Commerce Ministry's major difficulties in 
regulating this market lies in the 6 December 1990 decree that 
created CONASUC, the National Sugar Council, thereby granting 
the sugar factories a de facto monopoly on sugar imports. While 
continuing to allow importers and nonmanufacturers to import 
sugar, the minister announced that he would meet the concerned 
parties in the coming days to discuss restructuring and would 
then proceed to price revisions. 
  Asked about the Jonassaint government's real commercial and 
industrial priorities, Delsoin said he will attack the 
nongovernmental organizations [NGO] first in order to control 
their actions. 
  [Delsoin] "The NGOs are not obliged to trade, by definition. 
We notice nowadays, however, that they control businesses. 
Three ministers have committed themselves to the struggle for 
strict control of those NGOs. Press releases have been issued, 
so everyone knows that the government is studying the matter. 
Using someone else's words: We are serious about this. 
  ``There is a third area that we are very concerned about, 
but 
confidentiality is required.'' 
  [Jean] Another confidential area involves fuel controls. He 
said he refrained from making public statements so as not to 
annoy some friends: 
  [Delsoin] "Given the current circumstances, the Ministry -- 
meaning [word indistinct] of oil embargo -- the Ministry lost 
its authority in this area. Officially, we do not receive oil. 
Officially, we do not have oil. Thus, it is impossible for a 
state institution to have any control over this area. It would 
be like denouncing friends. In brief, I think the state is 
unable to intervene directly in this area."

  [Text] The Interior and National Defense Ministry has 
issued a protest note. Joseph Willio Noailles, interior and 
national defense minister, has formally deplored the media's 
malicious exploitation of his statements. The protest is in 
response to reports that Minister Noailles called the government 
illegitimate. He vehemently denies saying the infamous words, 
which he said were put in his mouth while he was in the 
Republic's Senate. Noailles asks the public to remain calm and 
to avoid the disinformation trap set for the government.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- Evans Paul, the 
mayor-elect of Port-au-Prince, today called for the resignation 
of General Raoul Cedras, commander in chief of the Haitian Armed 
Forces, to prevent implementation of new economic sanctions 
announced by President Bill Clinton. 
  Paul asserted that "the Governors Island Agreement continues 
to be the foundation for a solution to prevent new, very harsh 
and painful sanctions, which hurt all Haitians." He added that 
"it is vital for Gen. Cedras to recognize the need to respect 
his commitments." 
  Clinton announced a ban on commercial flights to begin on 25 
June and a ban on banking operations with Haiti. He also 
ordered the return of most of the U.S. citizens residing on the 
island. 
  Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of Deputies 
(close to the socialists), condemned the sanctions President 
Clinton implemented. He charged that it was a "racist, 
irrational, and an unprecedented decision." 
  Appalled, Monde asked: "Tell me which U.S. citizen can live 
on $50 a month." He was referring to the maximum amount 
Haitians living in the United States are authorized to send to 
their relatives in Haiti. 
  "I insist. The international community's strategy tends to 
punish those who voted for Jean Bertrand Aristide (the exiled 
president), who are the poorest," he said.

  [Text] New reactions have been recorded in Haiti following 
the U.S. sanctions. On 10 June, Port-au-Prince Mayor-elect 
Evans Paul asked General Raoul Cedras, head of the Haitian Army, 
to resign to avoid the application of the new sanctions 
announced on the same day by U.S. President Bill Clinton. The 
basis of the solution to avoid those new sanctions, which are 
very hard and very painful and which hit all Haitians, remains 
the implementation of the Governors Island agreement, Paul 
pointed out. Gen. Cedras must understand the necessity to 
respect his commitment, he added. 
  President Clinton announced among other things the 
interdiction of commercial flights between the United States and 
Haiti as of 25 June and the suspension of private financial 
transactions with Haiti.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- The Haitian Armed 
Forces, which according to its commander in chief, General Raoul 
Cedras, will fight any U.S. invasion attempt, is a professional 
troop of 7,500 poorly armed men. 
  Gen. Cedras' statement badly conceals the fact that the 
Haitian Armed Forces would not be able to offer strong 
resistance, although it could later tenaciously harass the 
occupation force, military experts in Port-au-Prince have said. 
They think it is feared, for example, that the hardline core of 
the Army might organize an urban guerrilla group to carry out 
terrorist attacks. 
  The regular troops, 5,300 soldiers and 1,600 policemen, and 
even the 925 officers come from mostly low-income or poor social 
classes. The Army has a deputy commander, Gen. Jean-Claude 
Duperval, and a chief of staff, Brigadier Gen. Philippe Biamby. 
The High Command is mainly made up of officers of the Class of 
1973 of the Military Academy, whose top student was Gen. Cedras, 
who is 44 years old. 
  This graduation class was the academy's first since being 
closed by President Francois Duvalier (Papa Doc, in power 
between 1957- 1971) for fear of military coups. Duvalier 
thought the officers of his time were subject to too much U.S. 
influence. 
  On the field, the leaders of the troops are officers of the 
Class of 1981, to which Lieutenant Colonel Joseph-Michel 
Francois, 35, Port-au-Prince chief of police, belongs. The 
Armored Corps, which is the best armored unit, played a key role 
during recent coup d'etats, including the one on 30 September 
1991 against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This unit, which 
has 26 officers and about 300 men, is stationed in Frere 
(southern Port-au-Prince) and is equipped with six light armored 
vehicles (V150 Cadillac) with 20-mm and 90-mm guns and machine 
guns. Recoilless 75-mm guns and 12.7-mm machine guns mounted on 
jeeps are also part of their arsenal. 
  The Air Force (another 300 men) has three Italian 
Siai-marchetti turbo propulsion training planes, a half dozen 
Cessna planes equipped with rockets, and a few Sikorsky 
helicopters. The Navy (300 men) has a dozen U.S. made patrol 
launches equipped with 20-mm guns or 12.7-mm machine guns, but 
only six are fully operational. 
  The light arms are mostly Galil assault rifles and Uzi 
submachine guns (Israeli), Brazilian Taurus pistols, and Fal 
Belgian assault rifles. There is also a small number of 
U.S.-made M-1, M-16, and M- 18 rifles. Some 3,250 soldiers are 
stationed in Port-au-Prince, and 250-500 men are in each 
department. There are also Army and police aides and 
paramilitary groups, which diplomatic sources estimate to number 
30,000. Salaries range from 1,000 gourdes ($333) for a private 
to 4,000 gourdes ($1,333) for a high-ranking officer.

  [Text] Airlines in Port-au-Prince are awaiting the decision 
on suspending passenger flights. The airline association 
president has said it will be business as usual while airlines 
wait to hear about the measure. 
  Frantz Desvarieux explains that the suspension of commercial 
flights could have some serious consequences for the airlines. 
Desvarieux, who manages Haiti Trans-Air, in Port-au-Prince, said 
his company would be particularly crushed if air traffic were 
suspended. 
  Correspondent Rothschild Francois reports: 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Desvarieux] It is a problem 
for 
the airline companies. The route is economically important to 
those companies that use it. It is the only route that Haiti 
Trans-Air uses. We would have to close. It would be 
economically disastrous. About 200 more people would be added to 
the country's unemployment list. It will be very difficult for 
we are a small company. 
  [Francois] Vacation time is a good time for the airlines... 
  [Desvarieux, interrupting] Generally speaking, this is the 
season. Summer is economically the best season for us. The 
same thing happened with the guys exporting mangoes. This is 
the mango season. They lost it. This is a consequence of what 
is happening in the country. 
  [Francois] Did you receive any notice from foreign companies 
telling you not to make reservations for July or September? 
  [Desvarieux] No. The regulations office did not give us any 
notice. These stories are out of the question right now. 
  [Francois] Asked about the restrictions Haitian passengers 
must face when traveling to the United States because of the 
embargo, Desvarieux said he recognized that the situation is 
getting difficult for the passengers who used to carry a certain 
amount of luggage, especially on their return to Haiti. 
  [Desvarieux] The passenger traveling from Port-au-Prince to 
Miami is only allowed to bring personal belongings on board. No 
commercial items are allowed. It used to be that you could 
bring certain products -- such as rum -- worth up to $100 with 
you without paying taxes. This is no longer allowed. 
Passengers are allowed to bring food on the return flight from 
the United States. U.S. customs sometimes checks for commercial 
goods and then seizes them. 
  We recommend that passengers carry personal belongings and 
whatever is allowed. Passengers should not bring large amounts 
of commercial-looking items. They will have difficulties. [end

  [Text] The Grand Front [FG] and Socialist Unity [US] blocs 
carried out their threat to walk out of the Constituent Assembly 
session as the regulations, specifically Article 129, were being 
voted on, and [FG leader] Fernando Solanas resigned his post as 
Constituent Assembly second vice president. Thus, the FG and US 
blocs expressed their repudiation of the approval of an article 
in the regulations indicating that the Nucleus of Basic 
Agreements must be voted on as a whole and not point by point, 
as repeatedly requested by the opposition. 
  The provincial parties and Movement for Dignity and 
Independence blocs, which also are challenging the regulations 
proposed by the majority, decided to remain in the Constituent 
Assembly meeting and vote against the regulations.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- Cordoba Provincial 
Governor Eduardo Angeloz today emphasized that the inclusion of 
the runoff system in the constitutional reform means the 
Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR] "have placed themselves at 
the doors of Government House." He believes that there may be 
an "electoral readjustment" in light of a second round. 
  Angeloz stated that the runoff system gives the UCR "a 
better 
election chance than before," although he said it now depends on 
whether the main opposition force "can recompose itself and 
define an absolutely positive party on the basis of stability, 
not on inflation, and on the basis of clear guidelines of 
growth, security, and dialogue for the country." 
  The Cordoba governor and head of the UCR's Political Action 
Commission (CAP) reiterated that the UCR is "an instrument that 
is completely out of tune," adding that he has been given the 
role of "tuner, seeking to get the orchestra together so that 
its members can look each other in the eye and have room to 
rehearse." 
  This morning, when talking to a radio station, he referred 
to the presidential elections, saying: "We are trying to tune 
the instrument to faithfully play the concert" in 1995. 
  Referring to the topic of federal coparticipation, he 
indicated that it "is good because it lets one know how much of 
the nation's cake is being eaten by each province." 
  He recalled that in 1987, when the Cordoba Province 
Constitution was modified, he "tenaciously" opposed "a clause 
that would have established how much the municipalities were to 
participate in coparticipation." 
  He admitted he "was mistaken at the time," adding that he 
believes the clause "helped to balance the social tensions 
provoked by the municipalities because now they know that when 
they draft their budgets, 20 percent of the corresponding 
coparticipation is shared out among municipalities. They know, 
therefore, what to expect." 
  Angeloz reiterated that the country's trade deficit, which 
is 
estimated to total $6 billion this year, is "a red alert." He 
believes "the pillars of economic progress will begin to crack." 
  He said the government "has completely disregarded health 
and 
educational processes, tossing them to the provinces where there 
has been a rise of about 500,000 unemployed following the 
implementation of the convertibility plan and where poverty has 
increased considerably." 
  "We, the provinces represented in the CAP, are affected, 
pained, and concerned that the topics of education and health 
are forgotten by the nation, including crises in many sectors 
and regions of the country that are watching the map of poverty 
expand," he added. 
  The head of the CAP, who on 8 June presided over its first 
meeting, said: "One's attention is called to the possibility 
that imports will amount to $20 billion, while exports will only 
amount to $14 billion." 
  "There is a total lack of encouragement to achieve the 
necessary hard foreign exchange for our exports and the tasks we 
carry out abroad," he said. 
  Angeloz said the objectives of the new organization are "to 
achieve a cordial atmosphere, to shorten distances, and to clear 
proposals in order to reorganize the future of the party." 
  He asserted: "It will not become an organization parallel to 
the party's National Committee," adding that its goal is 
"harmony of proposals, conduct, and attitudes."

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- President Carlos Menem 
reported on 9 June about a campaign by U.S. "specialists" hired 
from Argentina to "establish" among citizens the issue of an 
alleged illness of the chief executive that would make the 
fulfillment of his term of office difficult. 
  Menem announced: "They [not further specified] have hired 
specialists in transforming lies into rumors and rumors into 
accurate news." In this regard, Menem emphasized that an 
agreement had been reached with "U.S. citizens to establish this 
issue of the president's illness," even though he did not 
disclose the names of the people responsible for this alleged 
campaign. 
  Menem again charged "some media -- not all of them, but 
some" 
-- with allegedly conducting a campaign against him. He 
described this campaign as "a maneuver by some criminals who 
proliferate around there in some media." 
  The chief executive complained: "Now, how will I stay for 
three days in the United States? Do you know what some people 
say? That I will be admitted [to a hospital] in that country. 
These people have no restraint." 
  Menem urged the people: "Listen to the radio, watch 
television, read newspapers and magazines -- pay attention to 
the serious, responsible, and credible media, not those that use 
scandals to make a few more pesos. This is no good." 
  Nevertheless, the president emphasized that he would give 
the 
journalists "more freedom, if there is still anything left to 
give them." 
  Menem said: "Let them go on saying things. It does not make 
any sense because, as Peron used to say, reality is the only 
truth and the reality, which you can see now for yourselves, is 
that the president, this brother of yours, is healthy, strong, 
and willing to continue working." 
  Menem made these remarks during a 9 June Justicialism 
Meeting 
of Mutual and Cooperative Organization Leaders at the Central 
Market. 
  Addressing the issue of the economy, Menem criticized a 
petition made by "many entrepreneurial sectors that want a peso 
devaluation." 
  Menem stressed: "They are aware of the fact that, as a 
result, they would export more. Nevertheless, what would happen 
to the workers? This fraud will never happen again in 
Argentina." 
  The president indicated that if our "friends, the 
entrepreneurs, want to export, they have in their hands all the 
means to do it; they simply have to transform the enterprises to 
adjust them to current circumstances."

Camilion to "quickly eliminate the compulsory recruitment 
service and implement an entirely professional Armed Forces." 
  This was reported by the head of state, who unexpectedly 
asked reporters waiting outside the Olivos residence to enter 
the residence's main chalet, where the president was meeting 
with his ministers. 
  Menem interrupted the meeting to release the news, and then 
boarded a helicopter to travel to the northern dock of the 
metropolitan port to preside over a farewell ceremony for the 
training ship Fragata Libertad. 
  "We will report future steps in time. The Defense Ministry 
has instructions to take the appropriate measures, together with 
the military commanders and authorities, to fulfill what the 
president said," Menem added.

  [Text] The government yesterday reiterated its "firm and 
irrevocable determination to recover, through diplomatic means," 
the Malvinas, Georgias, and Sandwich Islands. The occasion was 
the 165th anniversary of the creation of the Political and 
Military Command of the islands that were occupied by Great 
Britain in 1833. 
  The Foreign Ministry yesterday distributed a communique 
saying that the government reiterates its "willingness to 
continue to explore the possibility of different understandings 
with the United Kingdom to contribute to the consolidation of 
peace and cooperation in the region," referring to the 
negotiation on Malvinas fishing and oil. 
  The document adds: "This attitude is proof of the belief 
that 
we are acting in the best interests of Argentina and the UK, 
seeking to create the appropriate framework for an adequate 
solution to the controversy." 
  In this context, "the Argentine Government's concrete 
actions 
are proof of its willingness to respect the Malvinas Islands 
inhabitants and to promote improved communication and effective 
cooperation between them and other inhabitants of the Argentine 
territory."

  [Text] La Paz, 9 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Foreign Ministry 
confirmed today that Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada and Chilean President Eduardo Frei will meet within the 
framework of the Fourth Ibero-American summit to be held in 
Cartagena, Colombia. 
  The Bolivian Foreign Ministry reported that the two heads of 
state, who will attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit on 14 
and 15 June, will take the opportunity to hold an informal 
meeting. 
  This will be the second time Sanchez de Lozada and Frei have 
met since August 1993; the other time was during Sanchez de 
Lozada's inauguration. 
  The Bolivian president took advantage of another 
international meeting, the Rio Group meeting in Santiago, to 
meet with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and then Chilean 
President-elect Eduardo Frei. 
  Bolivia and Chile have had no diplomatic ties since 1962 -- 
except for a brief three-year period (1975-78) -- as a result of 
a territorial dispute and Bolivia's demand for a sovereign sea 
outlet to the Pacific across land that has belonged to Chile 
since the 19th century. 
  The Bolivian Congress authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel 
to Colombia to attend the Ibero-American summit which will be 
attended by the heads of state from Latin America, Spain, and 
Portugal. The summit will be held in Cartagena on 14 and 15 
June. 
  Congress also authorized Sanchez de Lozada to travel to the 
United States, where he will attend the opening game of the 
World Soccer Cup at Soldier Field in Chicago; Bolivia will play 
Germany on 17 June.

  [Text] La Paz, 11 Jun (EFE) -- The Bolivian Senate today 
found Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and Supreme 
Court Dean Ernesto Poppe guilty of the crimes of prevarication 
and bribery. Their sentences will be disclosed within the next 
few hours. 
  The Senate held an extraordinary session today to carry out 
the legal process which began last year in the Chamber of 
Deputies. Oblitas and Poppe were accused of extortion by former 
Nicaraguan Deputy Presidency Minister Jose Antonio Ibarra. 
  The administration of Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada supported the decision to bring the Supreme Court 
justices to trial in an attempt to prove its political resolve 
to fight corruption. The 16 senators in the ruling coalition 
formed by the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR) and Civic 
Solidarity Unity (UCS) found the two justices "guilty." The 
three senators from the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) 
voted in favor of their acquittal, while the seven senators from 
the Nationalist Democratic Action (ADN) and Conscience of the 
Fatherland (CONDEPA) abstained from participating in the session. 
  Senate President Juan Carlos Duran from the ruling coalition 
declared a recess of approximately two hours to agree on 
sentences for Oblitas and Poppe, who were suspended from their 
posts shortly after their trial began. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0214 GMT on 12 June transmits a 
150-word report that Juan Carlos Duran, president of the Grand 
Jury of Bolivian Senators, decided today to postpone the 
sentencing of Supreme Court Chief Justice Edgar Oblitas and 
Supreme Court Dean Ernesto Poppe until Monday morning].

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Matter of Consistency"] </F>
  [Text] The 1990's are not like the 1960's, OAS Secretary 
General Joao Clemente Baena Soares said in justifying Cuba's 
rejoining the organization. The calendar was good justification 
for him. 
  No one can ignore the extent and depth of the changes 
produced by the current international situation -- quite 
different from the situation 30 years ago in the middle of the 
Cold War. At that time of tension and confrontation, Cuba 
undoubtedly represented a threat to the Americas' common choice 
of the liberal, democratic system of government, which inspired 
the OAS. It was almost a nightmare: The path on which Fidel 
Castro put his country a few months after the ousting of 
Fulgencio Batista brought the Cold War to Latin America, 
disrespecting all borders. 
  The socialist bloc never had any complaints about Fidel 
Castro's performance as its forefront agent. Without much work 
by foreign ministries or information offices, the Cuban 
revolution became an export product to all of Latin America. It 
was copied, like here in Brazil with a Sierra Maestra-type 
guerrilla in Caraparo, or in Angra dos Reis. The death of Che 
Guevara gave the revolution a proto-martyr. The revolution also 
created the Latin American Solidarity Organization (OLAS) as an 
alternative to the OAS. 
  None of this could survive the end of socialist regimes. 
Cuba 
was left drifting away, and it gradually approached the market 
economy, like China and Vietnam. The obsolete speeches by Fidel 
Castro have not been consistent with the increasing number of 
concessions he has been forced to make. "No matter what we have 
do to save the revolution and the conquests of socialism, we 
will never quit socialism," Castro said this year on the 
revolution's 35th anniversary. These are the last signs of an 
ideology that already has been placed in the museum of history. 
  Under such circumstances, it makes no sense to keep Cuba 
isolated from the community of the Americas. It makes even less 
sense to support the commercial embargo that is punishing Cubans 
while turning obstinate Castro into a hero. The lucid and 
persistent diplomatic action undertaken by Baena Soares is more 
significant for the Cuban people than the regular solidarity 
campaigns. 
  Early this year, the UN Human Rights Commission report 
advocated the end of the embargo in order to strengthen its 
diplomatic-negotiating capacity. In June, while abstaining from 
using commerce to pressure China, the United States renewed 
China's most-favored-nation status without any strong evidence 
of progress in this country's human rights record, which the 
United States had demanded. Putting an end to Cuba's banishment 
is just a matter of consistency.

  [Text] A new problem has cropped up in the campaign of 
presidential hopeful and former Sao Paulo Governor Orestes 
Quercia. Besides his poor showing in the polls and the 
ever-increasing popularity of former President Jose Sarney, his 
rival in the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] 
primaries, Quercia will now have to defend himself in court. The 
new problem arose out of an old case, the import of $310 million 
in electronic equipment from Israel. After studying the case for 
16 months, Federal Prosecutor Paulo Sollberger concluded that 
the former governor had participated in a "fraudulent 
transaction" that permitted two companies, Trace Company and 
Sealbrent, to profit from the importation, done "without seeking 
competitive bids and at excessively high prices -- as much as 20 
times more expensive," to the detriment of the state. Sollberger 
charged Quercia under a well-known article of the Penal Code: 
Article 171, which defines the crime of swindling. 
  The accusation will now be studied by 27 justices on the 
Superior Court of Justice, who face no deadline for decision. If 
the charges are rejected, the case is closed. If not, Quercia 
will be indicted and tried. He can still run for president, but 
would have to conduct a bizarre campaign, forced to spend a good 
part of his time explaining things to the court instead of 
seeking votes. Also charged are former Quercia Secretaries Jose 
Machado de Campos Filho (Finance) and Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo 
(Science and Technology). Five businessmen are also on the list 
of the accused. Among them is Arie Halpern, owner of Trace Trade 
Company. Besides the charge of swindling, Halpern also faces a 
charge of diversion of foreign exchange. Quercia reacted to the 
accusation with a typical campaign-trail argument."That's the 
work of PT [Workers Party] infiltrators," he said. The day 
before, expecting that the accusation would not be made, Quercia 
described the same Federal Prosecutor's Office as "impartial" in 
an announcement published in the newspaper. 
<H5>  Dummy Invoices </H5>
  Sollberger's charge, set down in 36 pages, were based on 
various documents. The main one is the "Technical, Scientific, 
and Technological Cooperation Protocol" signed in 1988 by 
Quercia and a witness at his wedding, then-Consul of Israel Tsvi 
Chazan. As the prosecutor sees it, that was when the plot was 
hatched. Based on a document he himself had signed, Quercia 
claimed the backing of an international agreement to do whatever 
he pleased. Another important document is an official 
communication sent by the former governor to then-President Jose 
Sarney. Although sent less than a month after the protocol was 
signed, the letter already announced the intention to import 
equipment from Israel, stating that "there was no similar 
Brazilian product available." Sollberger notes that Quercia's 
justification "was the same one cited as the reason not to seek 
international competitive bids" to equip the universities. The 
prosecutor concluded: "This shows that the governor was 
directing the state agencies to purchase the equipment offered 
by Trace." 
  The prosecutor observed that the equipment purchase was 
completed with surprising rapidity. According to the charge, 
Sealbrent, which appears as the vendor of the products, exists 
only on paper. Its headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland, a tax 
haven, and it was founded with only two pounds sterling of 
capital. Its owners are the same as those of Trace, the 
Brazilian firm that brokered the transaction. Sealbrent hastily 
registered in Israel as a "foreign company." The prosecutor's 
conclusion is that Sealbrent was set up solely for the 
transaction with Quercia. As a foreign company, it could easily 
send money out of Israel. Further evidence are the "dummy" 
invoices issued by Sealbrent. They are dated 20 March 1989, four 
months before the company was founded. The case file states that 
the Trace Company tried to sell the same equipment to 
then-Governor of Parana Alvaro Dias, who thought it was not a 
good deal for his state. Finally, Trace sold a training system 
to Mercedes-Benz of Brazil for $12 million. Similar equipment 
cost the Sao Paulo government $55 million. 
<H5>  Candidate-Defendant </H5>
  Quercia's attorneys have 15 days from the date of the charge 
in which to present their defense. VEJA consulted two of Sao 
Paulo's best-known lawyers concerning Sollberger's charges. They 
think the prosecutor did a good job. "The charge reveals with 
crystal clarity that there was a swindle," one of them said. 
Both thought it strange, however, that the prosecutor accused 
Quercia of swindling rather than another crime that, in their 
opinion, fit the actions better -- misappropriation of public 
funds. Misappropriation of public funds is when a government 
employee (which Quercia was) takes possession or permits others 
to take possession of public funds, as occurs in cases of 
overbilling. Swindling, however, requires a specific victim and, 
according to the lawyers VEJA talked to, Sollberger did not 
demonstrate this as clearly. 
  Current Sao Paulo Governor Luiz Antonio Fleury Filho, who at 
the time was secretary of public safety, has not yet been 
accused. According to the prosecutor, it was not possible to 
have an expert examine the equipment Fleury bought for the Sao 
Paulo police and there are no grounds for accusing him of 
overbilling, as happened in the case of the universities, an 
area for which Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo was responsible. The 
exclusion of Fleury worked to Quercia's disadvantage. If the 
governor had also been charged, proceedings could only be 
initiated with authorization from the Legislative Assembly, 
where the PMDB has enough allies to block the investigation. 
With Fleury not involved, the accusation will go directly to the 
Superior Court for consideration. The court's decision, for 
which Justice Costa Leite is rapporteur, will not be handed down 
before the PMDB primary, scheduled for 15 May. And that has 
created a new problem for the party: the possibility that 
Quercia will win the primary and be indicted shortly afterward. 
A movement to cancel the primaries was already under way last 
week with the idea of postponing the decision until the 
convention scheduled for the end of the month, by which time the 
legal status of would-be candidate Quercia may be known. "We 
must not nominate a candidate-defendant," said Senator Gilberto 
Miranda (PMDB, Amazonas State).

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Army Commander General Augusto </F>
Pinochet by EL MERCURIO correspondent Freddy Valverde in Prague, 
Czech Republic; date not given] 
  [Text] [Valverde] Local historians find it rather odd that 
you visited Austerlitz, where the Three Emperors' Battle was 
fought. What made you go there? 
  [Pinochet] We have studied Napoleon, from a technical 
viewpoint, during the battle in Austerlitz. But studying troop 
movements on maps is not the same as studying them on land. 
There are certain differences in the conclusions one reaches. 
I must say I was very impressed, and I am going to study this 
battle again now that I am acquainted with the battlefield, and 
I am sure it will be of great use for me and for those who study 
history. 
  [Valverde] How do you feel visiting a country that until 
recently was behind the Iron Curtain? Did you ever dream of 
visiting this sort of country? 
  [Pinochet] Look here, I am aware of what may happen. Last 
year I received an invitation to visit Russia but I turned it 
down because there are a lot of things in that country I do not 
like, and I do not need to go see what is happening when I can 
do so from outside. 
  In contrast, it has been very interesting visiting the Czech 
Republic because life here was not as strongly communist is in 
Lithuania, for example. This has not been the case here. But 
there seem to have been other things here. I realize there was 
strict police vigilance because whenever someone gets near me 
they check to see if there is someone next to them. But I must 
say that the progress here is quite significant. 
  In Germany -- in the former GDR, particularly in Dresden -- 
I 
saw very little progress, but it is taking place. There are a 
lot of destroyed buildings, a lot of houses in poor shape, in 
other words, one is under the impression that nothing much has 
changed there. In contrast, here you get the impression that 
they are doing well. 
  [Valverde] Why have you come to the Czech Republic? 
  [Pinochet] In the first place, I want to say that my visit 
is private. I have come in response to an invitation received 
from one of the most important weapon and ammunition factories 
in the Czech Republic. They invited me and I happily agreed to 
come, without any demands. 
  I have not come to shop. I have come to see, study, and 
learn the characteristics of what the Czechs have to offer, and 
I believe it has been a very positive visit. People sometimes 
complain that I do no receive protocol honors, that I am not... 
In the first place, I am not a politician. In the second place, 
I have not come to party. I have come to see, work, study, 
learn. I am studying the modernization of my Army; I intend to 
apply a lot of what I have seen here in Chile. This is the 
main reason for my visit. 
  [Valverde] But several people comprise your entourage. Have 
any of them purchased any Czech weapons or has any cooperation 
agreement with the Czech military industry been signed? 
  [Pinochet] So far I have not received any document, anything 
that refers to purchases. Obviously, when you visit a factory 
you receive offers... we still have not done anything that may 
end in a deal. 
  [Valverde] I believe you have visited several factories 
during these past four days. What do you think about the Czech 
military industry supposedly being in a retooling process? 
  [Pinochet] I believe it is a very serious industry. It has 
excellent engineers. The material it uses is of very good 
quality. I would say the Czech Republic has a sound military 
industry. As you may well know, in this country there are 
important defense industries that belonged to the dismantled 
Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the technology developed here, I 
believe, is very interesting and has great development prospects. 
  [Valverde] Your trip has stirred up polemics. There are 
rumors that you had some problems, like the case of the hotel in 
The Netherlands, as well as various comments and acts against 
you. What can you say about that? 
  [Pinochet] It seems some people did not like me travelling 
to this part of the world and have started a misinformation 
campaign. But I would like to say that I have visited many 
countries, many cities, and Prague is one of the most beautiful 
cities in the world. I have been very happy here, free of any 
problems, of any unpleasant gestures. Quite the opposite. The 
people on the street have even asked me for my autograph.

  On 1 June, the Army leaked information that Deputy Army 
Commander General Jorge Lucar summoned the corps of generals to 
assess the comments of Socialist Deputy Jaime Naranjo, who 
referred to General Augusto Pinochet's trip to Europe. He said 
the demonstrations against Pinochet show the world still

from his post after finding himself in the midst of a corruption 
scandal. Nunez, who was on leave for 60 days to facilitate the 
investigations conducted by a presidential committee, has 
reiterated that he is innocent but admitted that the scandal is 
harming the police institution and for this reason he should 
leave his post. 
  In announcing his resignation to reporters, Nunez said the 
institution's image has been seriously damaged and this has 
increased the agressiveness of criminals. In a noticeably 
shaken voice, Nunez said: Because of this basic consideration 
which is of an institutional and social-safety nature, I find 
that I must withdraw from the General Command by submitting my 
resignation. 
  The cabinet today discussed the resignation of the police 
chief. A government spokesman has told REUTER that Nunez' 
departure is a fact and that President Sixto Duran-Ballen will 
appoint a new commander general before Monday. 
  Nunez, who is well known for his diligent struggle against 
the underworld, has been accused of illegal acquisition of 
wealth and abuse of power. The charges, which initially were 
filed in mid-May against Nunez only, gradually were applied to 
the entire police staff by Police Colonel Hector Estrella, who 
exposed the scandal. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2331 GMT on 9 June in a similar 
report adds: "Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen has 
appointed General Miguel Rosero as the new police commander."]

  [Text] Quito, 11 Jun (EFE) -- On 10 June, Ecuadoran 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen called for a referendum -- he did 
not specify a date -- that will result in a plebiscite on 2 
January 1995 to convene a constituent assembly to reform the 
Constitution. 
  "Our greatest goal is to carry out a genuine reform of the 
social, political, economic, and moral systems," Duran-Ballen 
stated in a national radio and television broadcast. He 
revealed a seven-point questionnaire for the referendum, 
including the prospect of convening a constituent assembly on 2 
January 1995. 
  The proposed structural reform process seeks "to end the 
current institutional plan, which only promotes useless 
confrontations, absurd skirmishes, obstacles among the functions 
of the state, discredit, the degradation of justice, and, even 
worse, a total disregard of the fundamental mission of the 
state: to look after the welfare of its citizens," he added. 
  The other questions refer to the possibility -- now banned 
-- 
of electing citizens who are not members of political parties. 
Other questions focused on retaining or removing the prevailing 
capacity of the deputies to manage public funds and approving 
the state budget and the reelection -- also banned -- for any 
popularly elected position, including those of president, vice 
president, and deputies. 
  The sixth question focuses on the issue of whether deputies 
must be elected during the first or the second presidential 
elections every four years. Currently, deputies are elected in 
the first round, which makes Congress very heterogeneous. The 
last question asks for a referendum regarding the current 
prohibition on acquiring a second nationality without losing 
Ecuadoran citizenship. 
  Last April, Duran-Ballen convened the referendum with a 
similar questionnaire for 1 May 1994. However, his request was 
"illegally" denied by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE], he 
underscored today. TSE members then argued that holding a 
referendum on constitutional reforms was possible only if the 
deputies previously had directly denied the topics being voted 
on.

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Peace Commissioner 
Manuel Camacho Solis said today that the Mexican Government has 
affirmed its decision to respect the cease-fire in the conflict 
in the southeastern Chiapas State and maintains its commitment 
to a political solution in favor of peace. 
  "We still do not have the final (peace) agreements, but the 
decision to respect the cease-fire has been affirmed, and we 
maintain the commitment to seek a political solution in favor of 
peace," Camacho said after meeting with Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari. 
  On Sunday, Camacho Solis stated the government's position 
with regard to an announcement made by the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army (EZLN) that the first phase of the dialogue for 
peace is over. 
  The EZLN also called for a national dialogue with the 
participation of the country's "progressive and independent" 
sectors and announced that it will not prevent the holding of 
general elections on 21 August "in territories under its 
control." 
  The armed group, which forcefully occupied several towns in 
the State of Chiapas on 1 January, also unilaterally extended an 
offensive cease-fire and thanked the peace commissioner for his 
efforts to find a political conflict to the conflict. 
  Camacho announced during a news conference that the 
government agreed to maintain invariably a 12 January decision 
that the Mexican Army establish a unilateral cease-fire for all 
armed offensive actions (...) unless attacked. 
  He added that patrols and relief operations will continue to 
be carried out at the southern border and that measures will be 
maintained in view of the possible mobilization of weapons and 
explosives within the region of conflict. This measure seeks to 
prevent other groups in the area from arming themselves and 
provoking confrontations among communities and organizations, he 
said. 
  Camacho added that the solutions the government offered to 
the problems of justice and development, which are contained in 
the 32 commitments of the dialogue in San Cristobal, will be 
applied to other (?communities), which are not involved in the 
conflict, because they are fair. 
  Likewise, he said the state government will strengthen the 
dialogue and negotiation mechanisms in the areas under its 
control, and that, regarding the EZLN topics, he will request 
the participation of San Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz, who is 
the mediator. 
  The commissioner pointed out that the EZLN insists on his 
intention to be recognized as a militant force, which is not 
possible under any circumstance, "because it would undermine 
national sovereignty and the integrity of our territory." He 
added that "this would lead to interference by international 
forces in a Mexican domestic matter." 
  Governor of Chiapas Javier Lopez Moreno also announced 
tonight that he will be responsible for fulfilling the 32 
commitments reached with the EZLN in the peace talks and that 
Commissioner Camacho Solis will only intervene in the "delicate" 
cases.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary </F>
Committee-General Command, CCRI-CG, of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army, EZLN, in Mexico on 10 June] 
  [Text] Mexico, 10 June 1994 
  Reply to the peace agreements proposed by the supreme 
government. 
  To the Mexican people, the peoples and governments of the 
world, the national and international press, and brothers: 
  The Zapatist National Liberation Front's Clandestine Indian 
Revolutionary Committee-General Command respectfully addresses 
all of you to inform you of its evaluation and to reply to the 
peace agreements proposed by the supreme government at the 
negotiations table during the Meetings for Peace and 
Reconciliation in Chiapas. 
  1. The EZLN, a militant Mexican organization comprised 
primarily of Indians, rose up in arms against the supreme 
government on 1 January 1994. The EZLN demands are summarized 
in the 11 points outlined in the Lacandona Jungle Declaration: 
work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence, 
liberty, democracy, justice, and peace. Those demands are 
supported by the majority of the Mexican people, and the EZLN is 
struggling for those demands, for all Mexicans. 
  2. After bloody clashes between our troops and policemen and 
soldiers of the Federal Army, a national and civilian movement 
forced us to suspend the clashes and attempt to hold a dialogue 
with the supreme government. Those talks were held in the city 
of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, in late February and 
early March 1994. 
  3. On the occasion of the dialogue in San Cristobal, the 
EZLN presented a list of demands containing 34 points that could 
lead to peace with justice and dignity. 
  4. The list of 34 demands from the EZLN contains national 
and state demands, some for the entire population and others for 
peasants and Indians. The supreme government tried in vain to 
minimize the importance of our just struggle by viewing it as a 
conflict involving local Indian groups and even limiting it to 
four municipalities in the southeastern Chiapas State. 
  5. Our national demands for all Mexicans include: 
  a) Free and democratic elections with equal rights and 
obligations for all political forces. 
  b) In order to guarantee liberty and democracy, we 
demand the resignation of the head of the Federal executive 
branch as well as the illegitimate heads of the state 
governments. Following the president of the Republic's 
resignation, a transition government should be created, which 
will organize free and democratic elections. We also demand 
laws to guarantee the right of citizens and groups of citizens 
without any political affiliation to participate in the 
electoral process as a real and supreme authority. 
  c) We demand a new federal pact to put an end to 
centralism and permit the autonomy of Indian communities and 
municipalities. 
  d) We demand the revision of the free trade agreement 
signed with Canada and the United States because it is not 
consonant with Mexico's reality. 
  e) We demand dignified jobs and just salaries for all 
rural and city workers; we also demand the enforcement of and 
respect for the Federal Labor Law, for the benefit of all rural 
and city workers. 
  f) We demand an end to the sacking of our national wealth. 
  g) We demand the cancellation of all debts acquired 
through credits, loans, and taxes. 
  h) We demand solutions for the national problem of hunger 
and malnutrition in the Mexican countryside and cities. 
  i) We demand the immediate and unconditional release of 
all political prisoners and poor prisoners who are unjustly in 
jail throughout the country. 
  6. The supreme government avoided giving a positive reply to 
the national demands presented by the EZLN, which are supported 
by wide sectors of the Mexican people. 
  Developments that followed the dialogue in San Cristobal 
showed that the EZLN's demands for democracy were justified. 
The cowardly assassination of Colosio, the imposition of 
Zedillo as candidate of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary 
Party], and the newly acquired strength of government 
hard-liners showed that the resignation of Mr. Salinas de 
Gortari as chief executive on 1 January would have been the best 
option for the country. His efforts to perpetuate his position 
of power have created a permanent climate of insecurity and his 
efforts to commit electoral fraud to continue usurping power, 
through Zedillo, has placed the nation on the brink of a civil 
war. 
  The electoral reform was obviously incomplete. The presence 
of a flawed voters list leaves the door open to electoral fraud 
and confirms the violation of the people's will. The 
reinforcement of government apparatuses of repression and the 
attempt to force the Federal Army to carry out police duties 
shows us very clearly that the Salinist group is not seeking a 
democratic transition, rather fraud and imposition. 
  The EZLN reaffirms what is reflected by reality: The supreme 
government has no democratic inclination. The state party 
system must be destroyed. The EZLN reaffirms the demands made 
in points 1 and 2 of a document presented in San Cristobal: 
  1. Free and democratic elections. 
  2. Toppling the usurpers in the branches of the union and in 
the states of the Federation. 
  The EZLN broadens its demands: There is a need for a 
democratic transitional government and a new constituent 
assembly to ensure, with laws and in practice, compliance with 
the basic demands of the Mexican people: democracy, liberty, and 
justice. These demands found a voice among the voiceless, a 
face among the faceless, a future among the futureless, and a 
life among the dead. 
  The bad government tried to limit the demand for autonomy to 
the Indian communities and to leave intact the centralized 
system of power, which gives the Federal executive branch a 
dictatorial dimension. The government ignored the demand for 
genuine autonomy for the municipalities. 
  The law proposed by the government to recognize the 
political, economic, and cultural autonomy of Indian communities 
is being handled according to normal procedures: The bill does 
not present an in-depth solution and does not reflect a 
consensus among Indian sectors or experts, and attempts are 
being made to approve it in a hurry. Contravening its own offer 
that the so-called "General Law of Indian Community Rights" will 
be in response to "the demands, ideas, concerns, and political 
consensus of the Indian communities" and that it will be 
enriched by "a group of experts," the law simply complies with 
the procedure of fulfilling the requirement of regulating 
Article 4 of the Constitution, without consulting the interested 
sectors. 
  To the demand of revising NAFTA, the government replied with 
its stubbornness regarding continuing with an economic plan that 
has only contributed to increasing poverty in our country and 
deceiving foreign partners by promising them economic stability 
and social peace. The government promised to conduct "a careful 
evaluation of the impact of NAFTA." That evaluation has not 
been made. The Mexican people, however, can help save the time 
and money that will be spent by a commission "to evaluate the 
impact." The impact of the free trade agreement may be observed 
on the tables of any poor household in Mexico. 
  In reply to a national demand for dignified work and just 
salaries, the government continues to implement an economic 
policy that increases unemployment and underemployment and 
decreases the purchasing power of workers. Union corruption 
continues to be the foundation of the neoliberal economic 
project. 
  The demand to end the looting of national wealth has been 
ignored, and government action has been limited to the 
ecological aspect. There is no national policy to defend the 
country's natural wealth. The demand to pardon all debts 
acquired by poor segments of the population has been met with 
unfulfilled government promises to conduct a study, the result 
of which will certainly be to postpone any solution to the 
problem. 
  As in the previous examples, in response to a demand to end 
hunger and malnutrition among our people, there have been 
attempts to limit solutions to certain areas of Chiapas as if 
hunger and malnutrition were only a problem of the Indians of 
Los Altos and of the jungle area. As if the programs were food, 
the government has responded with promises to implement child 
nutrition programs. 
  In reply to our demand for the release of all political 
prisoners and all the poor people unjustly detained in Mexican 
jails, we have received promises of creating commissions to 
study those cases. The unjust Mexican judicial system, which 
only favors the powerful, will remain intact. 
  In sum, in no way did the federal government reply 
satisfactorily to the just national demands presented by the 
EZLN. Therefore, the EZLN rejects points 1, 2, 4, 7, 18, 20, 
21, 22, and 23 of the peace agreement proposed by the government. 
  7. Some of the EZLN demands for peasants, which include all 
Mexican peasants are: 
  a) Making Article 27 of the Constitution respect Emiliano 
Zapata's original spirit: Land belongs to those who make it 
produce. 
  b) Constructing hospitals and clinics for the countryside 
in all rural areas, with doctors and medicine. 
  c) Just prices for farming products, the elimination of 
mediators, and direct commercialization with peasants. 
  d) The Army and police should not act in rural 
communities for the benefit of political bosses and landlords. 
  8. The supreme government has refused to reply 
satisfactorily to national demands from peasants: 
  The government's refusal to abolish amendments to Article 27 
of the Constitution promoted by President Salinas de Gortari and 
to restore the right to land in the Constitution was repudiated 
by broad peasant sectors throughout the country. Amendments to 
Article 27 of the Constitution, which are the basis for 
neoliberal policy in the Mexican countryside, must disappear. 
The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States should 
resume Emiliano Zapata's struggle. 
  The reply to the demands for hospitals, clinics, doctors, 
and 
medicine for the Mexican countryside is limited to offers for 
the areas affected by the conflict. The right to health in the 
Mexican countryside will continue to be neglected. 
  Demands for fair produce prices and for the elimination of 
the middleman system have been met by the government with a 
vote-buying office, Procampo, [Program of Direct Support to the 
Countryside] whose efficiency is measured by its ability to 
corrupt peasant leaders and commit their votes to the party of 
the state. Promises of projects are the government's response to 
a Mexican countryside that is just barely surviving. 
  Demands for the departure of policemen and Army troops from 
rural areas have been met by the government with promises of 
changes in the administration of justice, the increased presence 
of troops and war materiel in conflict zones, and attempts to 
force the Federal Army to fulfill police duties. The arrogance 
of powerful cattlemen, who enjoy government economic support, 
bothers common land peasants and Indians in general. 
  In sum, the just national peasant demands of the EZLN have 
not received adequate responses from the federal government. It 
has only promised partial and local solutions. Thus, the EZLN 
rejects the peace agreement proposals in points 8, 9, 19, and 24. 
  9. Among the EZLN's national Indian demands are: 
  a) The right of the Indians to receive true and timely 
information through an Indian radio station that is independent 
of the government and led and managed by Indians. 
  b) Complete and free education for all Indian peoples. 
  c) Declaring the languages of all Indians official, and 
making their teaching obligatory at all school levels. 
  d) Respect for the culture and tradition of Indian 
peoples. 
  e) Eradicating discrimination and racism against Indians. 
  f) Cultural, political, and judicial autonomy for Indian 
peoples. 
  g) Respect for the Indian people's right to liberty and 
to a dignified life. 
  h) Economic and social support for Indian women. 
  10. The supreme government partially responded to the EZLN's 
national Indian demands. Although the government promised an 
independent Indian radio station, its response to the education 
issue has been limited to the selective scholarship method that 
deprives many Indians of their right to education at all levels. 
The rest of the government's responses to these points are 
limited to promises to carry out studies and programs in time 
periods that, in most cases, already expired. 
  In sum, the partial government responses to our national 
Indian demands and its failure to comply with previous 
commitments lead us to reject the peace agreement proposals in 
points 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 27, and 29. 
  11. Among the EZLN's demands at the state level are: 
  a) Holding general elections in Chiapas and legal 
recognition of all political forces in the state. 
  b) Installing electricity in the Chiapas countryside and 
a percentage of petroleum revenues. 
  c) Compensating war victims. 
  d) Repealing provisions in the Penal Code of the State of 
Chiapas that restrict the political struggle. 
  e) Halting expulsions and promoting the free and 
voluntary return of those expelled from their lands of origin 
and compensation for damage inflicted. 
  f) Holding political trials for Messrs. Patrocinio 
Gonzalez Garrido, Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, and Elmar 
Setzer M. 
  12. The supreme government unsatisfactorily answered the 
state demands of the EZLN: 
  The electoral reform in Chiapas does not allow groups to 
organize themselves to participate in elections, the demands for 
the electrification of the Chiapas countryside are answered with 
programs and promises, expulsions continue and those responsible 
are not punished, and there are only promises of economic 
support for the Indians in the state. When the support is 
finally given, it is in exchange for votes. The political trial 
of the three former governors, who forced us to rise up in arms, 
is omitted. 
  In sum, the unsatisfactory answers and our lack of 
confidence 
in the real fulfillment of government promises lead us to reject 
the government peace agreement proposals in points 5, 6, 25, 27, 
28, 29, and 30. 
  13. Finally, the EZLN demanded that the government recognize 
it as a militant force. The Mexican people, through the various 
organizations, have already granted us that recognition. 
  To our demand for recognition as a militant force and to the 
recognition of our troops as authentic fighters, the supreme 
government responded by offering guarantees of worthy and 
respectful treatment of the members of the EZLN and offering 
legal status for the EZLN. 
  The bad government cannot offer full security guarantees to 
its components, nor can we expect it to give worthy and 
respectful treatment to those who, interpreting the legitimate 
goals of democracy, freedom, and justice for the Mexican people, 
rose up in arms in a just struggle. 
  The EZLN was created as an army to demand respect for the 
people's will. This respect continues to be denied, and the 
people's will is disregarded by the usurping government. The 
reasons that led to the birth of the EZLN prevail; the EZLN will 
remain up in arms until the demands for democracy, freedom, and 
justice for all are met. 
  The EZLN agreed to observe international treaties regulating 
combat in war.... the EZLN has observed such treaties. We will 
continue to do it. The EZLN reiterates its demand to be 
recognized as a militant force and demands the recognition of 
its troops as authentic fighters. To achieve this, the EZLN 
will resort to the various international forums to demand this 
recognition from the peoples and governments of the world. 
  The recognition of the EZLN as a militant force is necessary 
so that the dialogue process can have firm bases for development. 
  14. The supreme government, in the dialogue in San 
Cristobal, presented its peace agreement proposal. The EZLN 
answered by explaining that it had to consult its members 
because the people who created us were the ones who ordered us 
into war and only they can give us the order for peace. 
Following multiple setbacks, the consultations ended; this is 
our reply to the government's proposals. 
  15. For all the above and based on the free and democratic 
voting of its members, the EZLN answers NO to the peace 
agreement proposal of the supreme government. It is terminating 
the San Cristobal dialogue; it reiterates its willingness to 
continue searching for a political solution that can lead to a 
peace with dignity and justice, and it calls all progressive and 
independent groups to a national dialogue of peace with 
democracy, freedom, and justice. We will not surrender! 
Democracy! Freedom! Justice! 
  Respectfully: 
  From the mountains of southeastern Mexico. 
  The EZLN's CCRI-CG.

<F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Clandestine Indian </F>
Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army on 10 June; "from the mountains of the 
southeast, Chiapas, Mexico"] 
  [Text]Everything for everyone. Nothing for us. The 
San Cristobal talks. Period, paragraph. 
  To the people of Mexico; to the peoples and governments of 
the world; to the nongovernmental organizations [NGO's]; to the 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas; to the 
national commissioner for mediation; to the local and 
international media: 
  The Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General 
Command [CCRI-CG] of the EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation 
Army] hereby addresses itself to you to report and state the 
following: 
  1. As reported in due time, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has completed 
a consultation in all of the villages that comprise and support 
it, the committee. Through the assemblies of communities and 
regions, we have learned about the feelings in our people's 
hearts. 
  2. The EZLN's CCRI-CG has counted the votes on the Federal 
Government's peace proposals presented during the talks in San 
Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. 
  3. Here are the results of the free democratic voting: 2.11 
percent voted for signing the government peace proposal; 97.88 
percent voted against signing the government proposal. 
  4. In terms of the proposals on what to do if it was decided 
not to sign the government's proposals, this is the result: for 
resuming hostilities, 3.26 percent; for resisting and calling 
for a new national dialogue with all honest and independent 
forces, 96.74 percent. 
  5. Consequently, and by an agreement of the Zapatist 
majority, the EZLN's CCRI-CG hereby announces: The federal 
government's proposal for a peace agreement is hereby rejected. 
The San Cristobal dialogue is declared terminated. 
  The people of Mexico are hereby called to a national 
dialogue 
with the country's progressive forces. The central subjects of 
this dialogue will be democracy, freedom, and justice for all 
Mexicans. 
  In order not to back down in the search for a political 
solution to the conflict, and in order not to interfere with the 
upcoming August's electoral process, the EZLN's CCRI-CG has 
ordered all regular and irregular forces throughout national 
territory and abroad to extend the cease-fire, refrain from 
attacking the Armed Forces, and permit the upcoming elections. 
  The EZLN guarantees that no offensive actions will be 
conducted against the Federal Army if the EZLN is not attacked. 
  The EZLN will not hinder the upcoming elections in the 
territories under its control and will permit the installation 
of electoral sites under the surveillance of the NGO's and the 
International Red Cross Committee. 
  The EZLN will accept absolutely no assistance from the 
federal, state, or municipal governments and will resist the 
siege solely with its own means and the Mexican people's help. 
  6. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Manuel Camacho Solis, 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, for his 
true efforts in the search for a political solution to the 
conflict. Unfortunately, the government's historical blindness 
keeps it from understanding that its refusal to yield to the 
impetus of democratization will lead the country into a painful 
confrontation whose consequences are unpredictable. 
  7. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, 
national commissioner for mediation, and his team for their 
efforts and sacrifice in mediating between the conflicting 
sides. We thank the team for their strength in resisting 
pressure and threats, as well as their willingness to listen. 
We hope that in the new stage of dialogue we are hereby calling 
for the team can join with its honest participation in the 
search for a political solution for the national demand for 
democracy, freedom, and justice. 
  8. The EZLN's CCRI-CG thanks the honest and independent 
media 
for their efforts in learning the truth and disseminating it to 
the Mexican people regardless of threats, pressure, or 
blackmail. We hereby apologize if, through our unschooled media 
policy, we angered them or mistrusted them. We expect them to 
understand that we had never before fought a revolution, and 
that we are undergoing a learning process. We hereby reiterate 
that, thanks to the press, the military stage of the war was 
stopped. We sincerely hope they will understand our difficult 
situation and the unfair selection and the elimination of those 
media that had access to us. We hope they continue along the 
path of truth. 
  9. The EZLN's CCRI-CG particularly thanks the NGO's, the 
vanguard of civilian society. The NGO's play an objective role 
in attaining the peace with justice and freedom that our people 
desire. The government's stubbornness has prevented any 
agreement so far. We remain open to dialogue and are willing to 
walk on the road that you marked for us: the political path that 
leads to democracy. 
  10. The EZLN's CCRI-CG greets all men, women, children, 
elderly people, and the faceless people throughout the country 
and abroad, who have expressed their solidarity and support for 
our cause. Our struggle is for you, our brothers. Our death is 
for you, also. We will not rest until all Mexicans, Indians, 
peasants, workers, employees, students, housewives, neighbors, 
honest artists and intellectuals, the retired people, the 
unemployed, the outcasts, and all of the voiceless and faceless 
men and women can have everything necessary for a worthy and 
true life. Everything for everyone. Nothing for us. 
  As long as the national flag does not fly over Mexican 
territory in democracy, freedom, and justice, we, the tender 
fury, wlll continue to fight. Democracy! Freedom! Justice! 
  [Signed] Respectfully, the CCRI-CG of the EZLN 
  [Issued] From the mountains of the southeast, Chiapas, 
Mexico, June 1994

Yaquis, the Mayos, the Tarahumaras, the Mixtecos, the Zapotecos,

[preceding word in English] and end of message. 
  From the mountains of southeastern Mexico 
  Rebel Subcommander Marcos 
  Mexico, June 1994 
  P.S. of imprudence: 
  We were advised to be prudent and to sign the peace 
agreement; we are told that if we do not sign the peace 
agreement, the government could finish us off in a matter of 
hours or days if it is delayed. We are advised to settle for the 
promises offered to us and to wait. We are told to have the 
prudence to surrender and live.... Who could live with that 
embarrassment? Who could trade life for dignity? Such sensible 
advice was useless because imprudence.... and dignity have 
reigned in these lands for many years. 
  P.S.: We were holding discussions in the committee all 
afternoon. We looked up the word for "surrender" in the Indian 
language, and we could not find it. There is no translation for 
it in Tzotzil or Tzetal. No one remembers seeing that word in 
Tojolabal or in Chol. They have been looking for hours for an 
equivalent word. It is raining outside, and a friendly cloud 
comes to lie down with us. Old Antonio is waiting for everyone 
to shut up until only the beating of the rain on the roof is 
heard. Old Antonio silently comes to me, coughing from his 
tuberculosis, and tells me in my ear: "That word does not exist 
in real language. That is why our people never surrender and 
prefer to die because our dead people believe that words that do 
not move should not be lived [nuestros muertos mandan que las 
palabras que no andan no se vivan]." Later, he walks toward the 
fireplace to scare off his fear and the early morning cold. I 
tell it to Ana Maria; she looks at me with tenderness and 
reminds me that old Antonio is already dead.... 
  The uncertainty of the last few hours in December 1993 
repeats itself. It is cold; the guards relieve one other with a 
whispering countersign. Rain and mud turn everything off. 
Humans whisper, and water shouts. Someone asks for a cigarette, 
and a lit match illuminates the face of the female fighter that 
is on duty.... It is only a slight instant.... but it is enough 
to see that she is smiling.... Someone arrives wearing a cap and 
carrying a rifle dripping with water. "There is some coffee," 
he says. The committee, as is the custom in these lands, 
decides to vote on whether to drink coffee or to continue 
looking for an equivalent of the word "surrender" in real 
language. Coffee wins unanimously. No one surrenders. 
  Are we going to be left alone?

<F P=106> [Text of communique by Subcommander Marcos from the Zapatist </F>
National Liberation Army (EZLN), addressed to the weekly 
newspaper PROCESO, the national newspapers LA JORNADA and EL 
FINANCIERO, and the San Cristobal de Las Casas newspaper TIEMPO, 
dated 3 June] 
  [Text] Gentlemen: Communiques citing "representatives" and 
information on the consultations are on their way. The clouds 
lean lazily on the sides of the mountains here. The sun is 
light gray and somnolent. The day is already a humid whisper 
dragging itself along amid the mud and thorns. Here's to you: 
health and an alarm clock (so as not to stay asleep). 
  From the mountains in southeastern Mexico, Insurgent 
Subcommander Marcos. Mexico, June 1994. 
  Postscript for Nuncio, Abraham. The rocket [previous word in 
English] was shot down. The antiaircraft team commanded by El 
Beto (eight slings and eight very good marksmen) detected the 
rocket when it was about to land, 20 meters before its tip 
touched the ground. Eight stones, little stones, rough stones 
gave it the kiss of death on its right flank. As someone about 
to lie down, the rocket tipped to one side. Our people, as is 
customary, organized a party. When they were bringing the 
marimba, El Beto approached the fallen rocket and said: "It is 
paper and cannot be eaten...yet." No one heard him; the marimba 
was already beginning to play the song Carta Marcada and the 
couples, using the rain as an excuse, squeezed closer together. 
We had to wait for the arrival of the newspaper, which 
absurdly, as everything here, came via facsimile. The photocopy 
of the rocket remained filed under "R" (for "Rocket" as well as 
"Reproaches"). Greetings to Monterrey, the land of the brave. 
  Cinematographic postscript. 
  Aerial shot. It is raining. The gray from above and the 
moisture will make these lands green again. The burning of 
fields is over; something new is beginning to appear amid the 
rocks and mountains. 
  Traveling shot. [Previous two words in English] Dirt, vines, 
and tall grass (they call them "houses" here). Women wash 
clothes in the stream very carefully, because "if they are 
scrubbed too hard, the clothes get torn and there is no thread 
to mend them." A boy is pretending an empty flip top [previous 
two words in English] cigarette box is a truck, loading it with 
pebbles. "They are sacks of corn," he tells the EZLN guard at 
the checkpoint who, amid the rain, tries to cover the boy with a 
piece of nylon [previous word in English]. It is useless, 
however; the truck is driving away from the checkpoint, and the 
guard must return to his position. Tonita washes her face with 
the rainwater she has collected in a can of light [previous word 
in English] drink. In an old wooden building, the only building 
with a metal roof (they call it "the school" here), amid dark 
faces, black eyes, mud-laden boots, old shirts, and red 
bandannas, men with mustaches discuss war and peace. The guard 
at the EZLN headquarters shivers coldly under the frayed plastic 
roof. The pole men from the barges arrive soaking wet: half 
sweat and half rain but all mud. Cold hands gather around the 
fire, weaving stories of big hats, squawk boxes [cajitas 
parlantes], and women who walk at night. El Beto stretches the 
opening of a balloon, which he has filled with water, and plays 
at making it rain. The water falls into the puddle at his feet. 
Moises and Tacho gaze at the swollen river then try to cross it 
on a wooden raft. No one says a word, they stare at the brown 
water as if they were looking at life. 
  Longshot [previous word in English]. Maria, 30 years old 
with eight live children ("four of them died"), emerges at the 
bend of the main road carrying a pack of wood on her back: the 
weight, the leather strap [mecapal], and the mud force her to 
look down. She also carries an axe in her right hand. Josefa, 
15, follows her with another wobbly pack of wood. Josefa is 
unconcerned about the mud; she is making sure the leather strap 
does not mess up her hair or pull out the eight "hairpins" she 
has fastened to her hair. Another bundle of wood follows, a 
scant few feet above the ground. Underneath it, barefoot, is 
Pedro, 8, one hand carrying a machete, the other holding the 
leather strap to help balance the weight on his head. 
  Medium shot [previous two words in English]. Hortensia, an 
EZLN rebel and seamstress, proudly shows off her latest 
achievement: she has made a pair of pants out of five torn and 
ripped pairs. When she shows the pants to the men, they all 
remember they have something to do elsewhere. Hortensia remains 
with the pants in her hands: It has four different colors and, 
inadvertently, she says, a little flower at the crotch. 
  Closeup [previous word in English]. Half covered by brown 
shirt sleeves, two hands use an awl and thick thread to mend a 
boot that has more scars than the back of Ahab's whale. The red 
bandanna provides relief for the blisters. 
  Upward shot. Under a puckered brow, two eyes dance from one 
side to another, lips begin to move and, amid quiet, whisper: 
  "Let my voice rise to the mountains 
  and fall to the ground as thunder, 
  that is what my throat would like 
  from now on and forever." 
  Downward shot. Someone is reading, with a rifle across his 
thighs. The words, sadly, reach out. 
  "Yesterday the people woke up 
  naked with nothing to wear, and 
  starving, with nothing to eat, 
  and today the day broke 
  justly stormily 
  and bleeding justly. 
  In their hands, the rifles 
  want to become like lions 
  to get rid of the beasts 
  they've had to face over and over. 
  Even if you have no weapons, 
  people of a hundred thousand powers, 
  do not let your mettle fail you, 
  get back at those who hurt you 
  as long as you have fists, 
  nails, saliva, and still have a 
  spine, heart, and guts, 
  your manly attributes and teeth." 
  A right hand reaches out and turns the page of the book by 
Miguel Hernandez. The lens loses focus, hesitates, and then 
refocuses, zeroing in on the paragraph: 
  "I am here to live 
  as long as my soul can dream, 
  and I am here to die 
  whenever my time is come, 
  in the bosom of my people, 
  from now on and forever. 
  Life is several swallows, 
  but death is simply one. 
  Audio off. "Who's there?" "The Fatherland." The echo can be 
heard amid the rain and the fog; the sound of feet squishing in 
the mud begins anew. 
  Fade out. The color green splattered with brown and red, 
sort 
of hidden behind the gray and the final wink of the camera 
shutter. 
  Audio off. A faraway plane fades into nothingness in the 
air.... 
  It is over. The Sup [name as published] behind the lens 
stupidly believes that the word play [preceding word in English] 
on the camera really means "to play"... [jugar].

<F P=106> ["More Than 20 Arrested in Connection With Jalisco Bomb </F>
Attack" -- NOTIMEX headline] 
  [Text] Guadalajara, Mexico, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The State 
Judicial Police [PJE] have reported that more than 20 people are 
under investigation in connection with the car-bomb explosion 
that occurred early Saturday morning in this Jalisco State 
capital. 
  The PJE reported that those arrested were in possession of 
weapons. Carmen Victoria Coronel, wife of Juan Jose Quintero 
Payan, was among those arrested. Quintero Paya apparently is a 
relative of drug-trafficker Rafael Caro Quintero. The police 
also reported that authorities seized a briefcase containing 
4,000 new pesos and $7,000 in cash, as well as an additional 
14,110 new pesos. 
  As part of the investigations, police raided the residence 
of 
Luis Enrique Fernandez Hurtado, who was not arrested, and seized 
seven AK-47's, known here as "goat horns"; an R-15 rifle; and a 
.45 caliber pistol. 
  It also has been reported that the people killed in the bomb 
blast have been identified as Marcial Gonzalez Muniz and 
Guillermo Gomez Chavez. Manuel Delgadillo Paez, director of the 
Investigations Department of the State Attorney General's 
Office, also reported that experts are working to determine what 
kind of explosives and how much were used in the bomb. 
  At 0200 (0800 GMT) Saturday, a Ford Grand Marquiz exploded 
in 
the parking lot of a Guadalajara Hotel where a birthday party 
was being held. Two people were killed and five others injured 
as a result of the explosion. The hotel management has filed a 
property-damage suit against whomever is found guilty of the 
attack. The police also reported that their investigations have 
established that two stolen cars were parked in the parking lot 
in which the bomb exploded.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A preliminary toll 
of five dead, six injured, and extensive property damage is the 
result of an explosion outside the Camino Real Hotel in this 
capital city of the Mexican Jalisco State, police authorities 
have reported. 
  The police confirmed that the incident occurred at 0230 in 
the morning (0830 GMT) when a 1993 Ford Grand Marquis car that 
had been loaded with explosives blew up. The vehicle was parked 
in front of the "Camichine" room of the aforementioned hotel. 
  Relief and security offices have reported that the explosion 
destroyed 10 vehicles, including the bus of the "Los Huracanes" 
musical group, and broke the windows of the room where a 
birthday ball was being held to celebrate the 15th birthday of 
Karine Ramirez. 
  Judicial Police Director Roberto Machuca Aguilar commented 
that the party started last night and that the room for the ball 
had been rented by a lady whose last name is Fernandez Castro, 
apparently from Sinaloa State. 
  Of the six people injured, who were sent to different health 
centers, five were identified as Jorge Castro Angulo, Alberto 
Menchado Montes, Arturo Rangel Martinez, Ramon Perez Velarde, 
and Jose Andres Gonzalez Padilla, 38, 30, 46, 34, and 20 years 
of age, respectively. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1450 GMT on 11 Jun 94 reports from 
Mexico City that "according to local reporters, the car bomb 
could have been placed as an act of vengeance between drug 
trafficking bands that operate in Guadalajara or as retaliation 
for the arrest of Manuel Quintero Payan, related to a powerful 
drug trafficking band." The AFP report adds that reporters have 
linked the arrest of Quintero Payan to the car bomb "because the 
people who attended the girl's birthday party talked like 
`northeners' and thus are associated to the drug trafficking 
bands."]

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A violent, aggressive, and threatening march in 
downtown Mexico City reached the National Palace. On Friday 
afternoon, various social organizations held a demonstration in 
downtown Mexico City. Approximately 5,000 persons were there to 
commemorate the 23d anniversary of the 10 June 1971 
disturbances. People of all ages took to the streets in the old 
section of Santo Tomas; they walked along Puente de Alvarado 
Avenue. When they reached the corner with Zaragoza Street in 
the Guerrero neighborhood, a bus driver, who did not stop for 
the marchers, ran over two persons. 
  Israel Lopez, age 25, who was driving the bus with Mexico 
State license plate No. 96JWV of Route 65, ran over Angel 
Sotero, age 48, and Victor Padilla Flores. Both were taken to 
the Ruben Lenero Hospital with fractures and internal injuries. 
A group of demonstrators wanted to lynch the bus driver and 
tried to turn the bus over. Judicial police took him away and 
protected him and later took him to the patrol station, which 
the demonstrators covered with spray paint. 
  Israel Lopez was turned over to the Investigation Department 
No. 7 of the Federal District. Among the demonstrators were 
people from the Francisco Villa Front, who two weeks ago, 
blocked the Ignacio Zaragoza Avenue. A female photographer, who 
was covering the demonstration, had to defend herself against 
two female marchers who started beating her up. Acts of 
aggression and attacks against reporters, cameramen, and 
photographers followed. 
  The demonstration continued down Hidalgo Avenue, Eje 
Central, 
and Madero Street until the marchers reached El Zocalo. The 
main gates and the front entrance of the National Palace were 
spray painted, and the demonstrators shouted insults against the 
government.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "White Glove Interventionism"] </F>
  [Text] Topping the strongly interventionist statements made 
by Congressman Robert Torricelli a few weeks back, James Jones, 
the U.S. ambassador to our country, has now crossed the line 
that separates a mere opinion on a political process -- in this 
case, the Mexican process -- from statements that imply 
intentions to modify it. 
  The Washington Government usually considers our country 
"excessively sensitive" when it reacts to comments made by U.S. 
diplomats on national political, social, or economic issues and 
denies that those statements are made with an interventionist 
intention. However, although the historical background of 
relations between Mexico and the United States offers enough 
reasons to be sensitive, the different representatives of the 
White House in Mexico seem not to be able to resist the 
temptation of slipping in (with more or less subtlety, according 
to the diplomacy of the official holding the position at the 
time) statements geared to pressure the national government to 
adapt its actions to Washington's needs, desires, or whims. 
  The irrepressible tendency shown by successive U.S. 
ambassadors in our country to interfere in Mexico's internal 
affairs reveals, in a modified and polished manner, our northern 
neighbors' old belief that all the nations located south of the 
Rio Bravo are, in the end, nothing more than the backyard of the 
United States. 
  When James Jones asserted, for example, that the recent 
entry 
of Mexico to the OECD and the signing of NAFTA "would oblige" 
authorities to act in a set manner (in this context, it is 
unimportant if the manner is correct or not), the U.S. 
ambassador seems to forget that the implementation of new 
commercial policies is a product of decisions that are the 
exclusive domain of the national government and have no direct 
relation to our country's internal political situation and that 
Mexicans are the ones who have to solve problems that derive 
from this situation. 
  Likewise, when the U.S. representative in Mexico refrains 
from saying whether foreign observers are necessary, but 
emphatically asserts that "they will be here on 21 August," he 
again adopts -- although his manner is more veiled than the one 
used by his predecessors -- the interventionist attitude that 
has characterized U.S. ambassadors in the republic. 
  Either the borderline between opinions and interventionist 
statements is too hazy for U.S. diplomats or our new commercial 
partners insist -- even if they publicly manifest their best 
wishes for our country -- in their belief that their position as 
world power gives them the authority to exert an irritating 
political tutelage over Mexico and its inhabitants.

  [Text] Hermosillo, Sonora State, 8 Jun -- Federal Treasury 
Police agents yesterday seized 10,000 rounds of small-arms 
ammunition of various calibers at the 21-km marker checkpoint in 
Nogales. The ammunition was apparently on its way to Guerrero 
State. 
  The Nogales customs office indicated the seizure was made 
after inspecting a Dodge van bearing Oregon State license 
plates, from where the shipment destined for Guerrero came. 
Hidden inside boxes containing second-hand clothing, tires, and 
home appliances, the authorities discovered 7.62-mm, 9-mm, .38 
super-, .380-, .22-, and .30-caliber cartridges. Javier Chavez 
Rodriguez and Demetrio Goicochea Rodriguez were arrested and 
turned over, along with the shipment, to the Federal 
Prosecutor's Office in Nogales.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo de Leon, Institutional </F>
Revolutionary Party presidential candidate, by Jacobo 
Zabludovsky in Mexico City; on the "24 Hours" program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zabludovsky] Two days ago, on Monday, Ernesto 
Zedillo presented his program for economic reactivation and 
steady growth. For this reason, we invited him to the "24 
Hours" studies tonight. Mr. Zedillo, good evening and thanks 
for being here. 
  [Zedillo] Good evening and thank you, Mr. Jacobo and kind 
listeners. 
  [Zabludovsky] I would like to talk about your economic 
program. I would like you to tell us how this program, which has 
already been so profusely covered by the media, benefits the man 
on the street, the common Mexican citizen? 
  [Zedillo] Jacobo, this program has been designed to create 
more jobs in our country. During my campaign tours, I have 
discovered that one of Mexico's most serious problems is the 
lack of opportunities for work. The only way to correct this 
situation is by making our economy grow again. There will be no 
additional jobs if no more businesses are created or if those 
that exist are not expanded. This is why my program is designed 
basically to stimulate investment and, through investment, 
growth and opportunities for work and higher salaries for all 
Mexicans. 
  [Zabludovsky] You have said the positions of other 
candidates 
are probably prompted by demagoguery, particularly regarding 
spending more in some areas. Why? 
  [Zedillo] Because I believe that one of the essential 
requirements for the country to develop in the future is to 
maintain a certain financial discipline to avoid the same 
situations of the past. Some candidates have proposed to spend 
more and more without paying sufficient attention to the 
country's financial problems. I propose to consolidate what was 
done in the past few years and, beginning from there, enter into 
a new state of the country's development where stimulus for 
growth receives the main emphasis. Our idea is for the 
government to actively promote economic growth and the creation 
of jobs that so many millions of Mexicans require. This should 
be done through rational instruments and without returning to 
past policies 
  [Zabludovsky] So what would be the main differences between 
what you propose and what the other candidates, in particular 
the National Action Party and Party of the Democratic Revolution 
candidates, have proposed? 
  [Zedillo] They have discussed problems and expressed good 
intentions but so far they have not presented any specific 
strategy to deal with the country's economic problem. I think 
the difference is very clear. I have a proposal for economic 
growth, the creation of jobs, investment, better salaries. This 
is the proposal I presented on Monday. The people are still 
waiting for the other candidates to present sound proposals. 
Certain adjectives have been used. One of the candidates 
speaks of a humane economy, but he failed to say how he will 
achieve this. The other candidate mixes very old recipes and 
some updated ideas, of which he has gradually become convinced. 
From my viewpoint, they have no proposals. Of course, it is 
the people who will have to assess this. 
  [Zabludovsky] Do you think the proposals have been 
sufficiently understood by the would-be voters? 
  [Zedillo] I am not sure the candidates still endorse their 
proposals. The problems have been pointed out at length, but 
there has not been much in terms of proposals. In this 
campaign, I have tried to present proposals, telling the people 
how I propose to solve problems. In this campaign, I have tried 
to listen to the people's problems. It is my duty to listen to 
those problems, but also to offer solutions. 
  [Zabludovsky] Some aspects of your speech were discussions 
of 
the economy, training, and health. What is the relationship 
between these aspects? 
  [Zedillo] Jacobo, economic growth depends on how much 
capital 
we invest. Not only physical capital, as manufacturing plants, 
roads, or dams, but human capital as well. Human capital is 
perhaps the most important factor in a country's development. 
How much we invest in men and women to make them more capable, 
educated, productive, and more willing to work and produce for 
the economy's sake, is what counts. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mexican citizens sometimes think proposals 
exceed reality. How will your program make the family budget 
sufficient? 
  [Zedillo] My program includes very specific aspects to 
promote investment. The program identifies the obstacles that 
at present prevent greater investment in our country. Through 
these stimuli for investment, new enterprises will be 
established and those already existing will be expanded. This 
will create more jobs. My proposal regarding education, 
training, and technology will increase productivity. With more 
jobs, greater economic activity, and greater productivity, 
salaries will increase. 
  Wages and employment are two important factors that 
determine family well-being. This is why we are talking about 
shifting from a good macroeconomy, which must be consolidated, 
respected, and sustained, to a good microeconomy, which consists 
of suitable family incomes and large production output. 
  [Zabludovsky] You included fiscal policies in your 10-point 
plan. We have heard medium- and large-scale businessmen 
complaining that there are too many taxes. We have also heard 
small-scale businessmen complaining that there is so much red 
tape they would rather pay fines than stand in long lines. 
  [Zedillo] I believe they are right. Jacobo, we are proposing 
a number of tangible measures. First, we are suggesting larger 
judicial security for taxpayers and a substantial reduction of 
tax procedures, as well as tax reductions. For instance, we are 
planning to reduce the 2-percent tax on assets as well as a 
number of benefits to promote investments. According to my 
plan, new businesses and investors are granted a four-year grace 
period to pay this tax. In addition, those businesses that are 
reporting losses, but reported profits in at least one of the 
three previous years will not pay this tax. As for small- and 
medium-scale businesses, I am proposing to expand the number of 
businesses that pay this tax quarterly instead of paying it 13 
times a year. This is a very good benefit, because it saves 
tax-filing time and gives liquidity to those businesses that are 
currently making monthly payments. Should this proposal be 
approved, they will pay the 2-percent tax on assets quarterly. 
  Furthermore, we are also recommending a mechanism to 
directly 
promote investments through a more generous investment 
amortization system and a number of fiscal incentives for 
training, technology, and purchasing antipollutant equipment. 
These are some of the many measures we are proposing to 
directly benefit businesses to ensure they will be motivated to 
invest more. 
  [Zabludovsky] Mr. Zedillo, in the last five years we went 
from an almost 200-percent inflation rate to a 8- or 9-percent 
inflation rate; I am not sure. This policy had a social cost. 
I am wondering if you are planning to have single-digit 
inflation rates. Is it worth it? 
  [Zedillo] It is worth it and necessary if we want to achieve 
sustainable economic growth in the future. The effort that had 
to be made was already made; we now must consolidate this 
effort. This effort is letting us reach a growing economic 
stage, which we could not reach in the last few years, because 
we failed to see the country's reality for many years. Thanks 
to this effort, which consisted not only of controlling 
inflation but also of changing the economic structure of the 
country with a broader opening and other measures, we currently 
have the opportunity to begin growing. I am suggesting that the 
economy must grow at least 4 percent by 1995, following two 
years of virtual stagnation in 1993 and 1994. 
  [Zabludovsky] Let us talk about other issues. Since we have 
you here, let us seize this opportunity to ask you other 
questions. How do you feel about your campaign? What experience 
have you gained since you were nominated presidential candidate 
for the Institutional Revolutionary Party? 
  [Zedillo] Thanks to my being in constant contact with the 
people, I have found two basic concerns: people are concerned 
because they want to improve their personal and family situation 
and because they want to put and end to unemployment, 
insecurity, and poverty. In short, people are concerned because 
they want to live in better conditions and in a better country. 
On the other hand, I can see there is hope. People believe we 
are about to overcome our problems, the country is capable of 
solving them, and the difficult times we are currently living 
are temporary. We are close to reach a different and better 
stage for all Mexicans to begin thriving. 
  [Zabludovsky] In light of certain criticisms, do you believe 
the upcoming elections will be honest, fair, and free of doubts? 
  [Zedillo] Jacobo, all political parties have been working 
hard to improve our electoral system. The latest reform 
concluded last week, and we currently have an electoral system 
that has nothing to do with the electoral system of six years 
ago, or even three years ago. We now have an electoral 
organization whose board of directors is made up mostly of 
independent citizens. We have a large number of citizens at all 
electoral bodies. 
  Almost 2 million Mexicans will participate in the 
organization of the upcoming elections. Only a small number of 
them will represent my party; the rest will be representatives 
of other parties and citizens selected through a double-election 
process. I believe we have an exemplary electoral system that 
citizens must trust. I am sure the upcoming elections will be 
exemplarily legal, honest, and reliable. The country deserves 
and demands it, and this is the way it should be. [passage

  [Text] Belmopan [dateline as received] -- Belizean Prime 
Minister Manuel Esquivel today announced that at the upcoming 
meeting of the Caribbean Common Market [Caricom] scheduled for 
July, he will propose the creation of a regional commission to 
establish a dialogue with the Haitian military. 
  Esquivel voiced his desire for such a commission to serve as 
mediator in the search for a solution to the crisis that Haiti 
has been experiencing since 30 September 1991, when a military 
junta overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Esquivel, who is taking part in a meeting of representatives 
and governors of Central America, the Caribbean, and the United 
States, said the proposal may be supported by other countries of 
the region, including Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, and 
others. Delegates of 13 Caricom member-states, Central American 
economics ministers, and eight governors from U.S. southern 
states are participating in the two-day meeting. 
  Esquivel said there is a great deal of resistance on the 
part 
of the Haitian military, perhaps because it views the United 
States as a great power. With the creation of the commission, 
which would not attempt to displace Washington, "there could be 
other alternatives," he said. 
  He added: "It is perhaps easier for the Haitians to talk 
with 
the small countries of the region rather than with the United 
States. The message would be the same; only the messenger would 
be different." 
  He believes the U.S. Government has dealt with the problem 
well. He said: "Its ideas are good. The problem is that the 
United States is the world's most powerful country. It is 
difficult for it to talk with one of the smallest countries in 
the region. I think it is also easier for the rest of the 
countries to talk with one another than with a larger country."

  [Excerpt] On 9 June, the Chamber of Deputies passed a draft 
bill approving an agreement to cooperate in the prevention and 
control of the laundering of money derived from the illegal 
trade of drugs and narcotics. The document was signed between 
the Paraguayan and U.S. Governments in November 1993. 
  Deputy Constantino Mencia Ayala, head of the Drug 
Enforcement 
Committee, argued in favor of approving the bill considering the 
need for mutual cooperation to control drug traffickers' 
international money laundering. 
  He said the agreement's purpose was to eradicate money 
laundering through adequate cooperation between the two 
governments, particularly considering the major increase in 
mafia-linked financial operations to launder dollars obtained 
through the sale of narcotics. 
  Deputies passed the bill by a broad margin and immediately 
sent it to the executive branch for promulgation. [passage

  [Text] The Argentine Government has accepted a Paraguayan 
proposal to postpone until 16 July the start of filling the 
Yacyreta Dam. This was announced on 8 June at the end of a 
meeting at Government Palace between President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, and 
Argentine Ambassador Raul Carignano. During this time all 
problems on the Paraguayan side of the river must be solved. 
Carignano said President Wasmosy assured him that the Paraguayan 
Government will guarantee the fulfillment of the treaty schedule 
and that the postponement will not affect the date established 
for the first generator to begin operations -- 1 September.

<F P=106> [Report by Gandhi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The wave of death threats by clandestine sectors 
against public personalities also reached President Dr. Armando 
Calderon Sol, who said today that this form of intimidation will 
not make him relent from his efforts to consolidate peace and 
democracy in El Salvador. 
  The president asked people to be sensible, to have common 
sense, and to have confidence in the country's institutions, and 
not to be alarmed by a simple telephone call making a death 
threat. Calderon Sol referred to the incident during a news 
conference in the National Assembly where he went to request 
permission to leave the country. 
  This is Dr. Armando Calderon Sol's first visit to the 
deputies in his role as constitutional president. On Thursday 
the president went to request permission to travel to Latin 
America and the Caribbean during 1994. After his request was 
ratified, the president met with the press. This is when he 
disclosed that he had received threats. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] During all my political 
career 
I have been the victim of and have suffered much from 
disinformation, all sorts of threats. You were witnesses of how 
it was said that there were explosives in my office when I was 
mayor of San Salvador -- anyway, we have had everything. 
Nothing intimidates me, nothing scares me. I know that my work 
and my efforts are for the sake of the Salvadoran people, for 
the most needy. [end recording] 
  Thus, the president joins the list of officials, such as the 
Ombudsman and Deputy Milena de Escalon, who have also received 
death threats these last few days. 
  Regarding another issue, President Calderon Sol referred to 
the imminent appointment of the new PNC [National Civilian 
Police] director and he mentioned two of the candidates with the 
most possibilities -- PNC Administrative Chief Rodrigo Avila, 
but especially National Public Security Academy Director Dr. 
Mario Bolanos. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] Dr. Bolanos is being 
considered; he is doing an excellent job. The academy is worthy 
of recognition not only nationally but internationally as well. 
The countries that are cooperating and helping with technical 
missions recognize the effort and the work done in the police 
academy. [end recording] 
  The president also announced that he will travel on Sunday 
to 
Costa Rica to meet with his Central American colleagues to 
prepare a joint document in connection with the region's 
sustained development to be presented at the Ibero-American 
Summit next week in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.

  [Text] Deputy Carmen Calderon de Escalon (the president's 
sister) has received a death threat. Gloria Salguero Gross, the 
president of the National Legislative Assembly, reported this 
yesterday. 
  The official said that the deputy, who lives in Santa Ana, 
received the threat on Wednesday in an anonymous telephone call, 
taken at the headquarters of the Nationalist Republican Alliance 
(ARENA) in that western city. They said they "were going to 
kill her along the Santa Ana-San Salvador highway." Miss 
Salguero credited the threats to "sick minds." Deputy Calderon 
de Escalon, sister of President Armando Calderon Sol, is 
currently the secretary on the Assembly Board of Directors and 
an ARENA leader. She also chairs the Assembly Treasury 
Committee and a Special Budget Commission. 
  A commission, which was appointed by the Assembly Board of 
Directors, is studying security for the legislative building and 
its deputies. There are 84 deputies in all and to provide 
security for all of them would require a special budget 
appropriation. 
  Salguero Gross, during the first news conference she has 
given as assembly president, also reported that President 
Calderon Sol will appear at today's plenary session to formally 
present his first request for permission to leave the country. 
Unofficial sources said the president will travel to Costa Rica 
and Puerto Rico. The assembly president indicated that he will 
be given a special one-year permit to travel anywhere in Latin 
America. 
  Meanwhile, the official announced that members of the media 
will be required to carry a special "card" to gain access to the 
assembly installations. In her opinion, this is organization. 
For others it is limiting the freedom of press. 
  In addressing the "self-investigation" the deputies are 
supposed to complete on themselves on the excessive cost of the 
remodeling and repair work done at the legislative buildings, 
Salguero Gross reported that an external audit will determine 
whether there was mismanagement or not. Deputies of the new 
Technical Committee (charged with overseeing the construction 
work at the building) agreed to request an independent audit to 
determine if the construction of wooden dividers really costs 
4.2 million colones. A member of this committee reported 
yesterday that before this the committee will investigate the 
name and background of the contractors involved in the project, 
including the air conditioning supplier. 
  [San Salvador DIARIO LATINO in Spanish on 9 June carries a 
375-word report on page 24, with reactions by the UN Observers 
for El Salvador, ONUSAL. ONUSAL Chief Enrique Ter Horst said 
that "the threats should not be taken more seriously than what 
they really are." He explains that "they are anonymous so 
anyone can make them." "We have no way of knowing," Ter Horst 
continued, "whether the threats were made by death squads or by 
some impulsive individual wanting to have some fun creating

Rights Division, said that the special ONUSAL investigation 
group will look into the incidents.]

<F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister General Humberto Corado </F>
Figueroa by reporter Balmore Parada on 9 June; place not given; 
from the "YSU Radio News" newscast -- first paragraph is Parada 
introduction] 
  [Text] Defense Minister General Humberto Corado Figueroa 
today condemned death threats that have been made against 
Salvadoran officials and well-known personalities. Gen. Corado 
offered the Army's cooperation in this regard, although this 
institution is not responsible for public security. The 
self-styled Domingo Monterrosa Command this week issued an 
anonymous message making death threats against several 
officials, including Human Rights Ombudsman Carlos Mauricio 
Molina Fonseca. Nationalist Republican Alliance Deputy Carmen 
Calderon de Escalon also received a death threat on the phone. 
Corado said that these actions will have to be neutralized so 
that these threats do not materialize. 
  [Begin recording] [Corado] We condemn actions of this type 
because they are not compatible with the current political 
situation in El Salvador. There is now total freedom to 
demonstrate and participate politically, and, as a result, 
violence will not be tolerated. Logically, we must take these 
threats seriously, with the responsibility to prevent them from 
materializing, because the truth is that these threats harm our 
country. 
  [Parada] Is the Army willing to help investigate [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Corado] Yes. We have always said that, although public 
security is not our main responsibility, we are always in touch 
with the Public Security Ministry and, previously, with the 
National Police and National Civilian Police to use our 
resources to begin joint action with them designed to counter 
these threats. 
  [Parada] In statements to the media, Corado also referred to 
the current problems demobilized Army members are facing in the 
process of reintegration. Corado noted that the process is 
slow. Consequently, he urged former soldiers to be patient. 
  [Corado] The truth is that the reintegration process is a 
very long one. We have already said that the political will and 
the commitment to comply are there. However, former soldiers 
must be somewhat patient because this is a slow process. For 
instance, in order to award land, the government must buy, 
measure, and determine who can settle in those properties. This 
is a very complicated process that does not occur overnight, but 
it will be accomplished. There is a moral commitment to former 
Army members to provide them with all the benefits granted by 
the agreements, and we have never opposed their receiving these 
benefits. We must only bear in mind that it is a long process 
and that they must be patient. 
  [Parada] They insist that over 18,000 demobilized members 
are 
entitled to receive compensation. 
  [Corado] All those covered by the legislative decree issued 
for this purpose will be compensated; that is, those who can 
prove they meet the requirements will receive the benefits. [end 
recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio with </F>
unidentified reporters on 7 June; place not given; from the 
"Telepress" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] How is the Jorge Carpio Nicolle case 
coming along? 
  [De Leon] This investigation has proven very difficult for 
the executive branch, and it has had a high cost. We have 
located a weapon, at least one weapon, which is essential 
evidence that can lead us to the perpetrators of this damnable 
crime. Ballistic tests were carried out, and it was proven that 
this weapon was at the scene of the crime, and, therefore, this 
is an unquestionable lead. This lead might take us to criminals 
here or in any part of the world. 
  These investigations have shown that the evidence we have 
against these people is such that, in my opinion, their arrests 
were warranted, and indeed this was the case. We contributed 
and even requested the Army's assistance in arresting these 
people. 
  Today, however, we see that the judge inexplicably has 
ordered the provisional release of these three people. I cannot 
interfere in a different branch of government, and I respect its 
independence. Nevertheless, one really cannot explain how these 
three people can be released today because of a lack of 
evidence, according to the judge. I repeat, the weapon that was 
fired at the crime scene has been identified, and this has been 
proven through ballistics. 
  These are the kinds of things that disappoint the people of 
Guatemala, because justice is neither swift nor adequate. These 
disappointments are what can cause increased violence and 
sometimes cause people to take the law into their own hands. It 
is very sad. 
  Again, I do not want to interfere, and I do not want this to 
be misinterpreted. I am not a judge, and I do not have the case 
file in my hands. This is the judge's responsibility. He 
issued this ruling under his own authority, but for the 
Guatemalan people, this is a slap in the face -- something that 
takes away hope and prompts the people to ask whether justice is 
fair. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what hope do the people have 
if 
the judicial system fails them in cases as important as this one? 
  [De Leon] This is the question one has to ask. If this 
happens in such a highly publicized case because of the stature 
of the individual killed, someone like Jorge Carpio -- a 
political leader, a media director -- and in a case supported by 
such a detailed investigation, as well as a case backed by 
pressure from every sector, and then the justice system goes 
ahead and rules as it did, then we must ask ourselves what can 
ordinary citizens expect. What can Indians expect from the 
justice system? It is truly disappointing. 
  I learned of the ruling through the press. If this is 
disappointing and exasperating for the president of the 
Republic, how must the Guatemalan people receive the news? 
  [Reporter] The human rights ombudsman has requested an end 
to 
military conscription because of violations even to minors 
[words indistinct]. What decision will be reached? 
  [De Leon] This is an issue that has been under discussion 
for 
a long time. There is a draft bill aimed at resolving certain 
anomalies that the defense minister himself mentioned a few days 
ago. Regrettably, once more we fall into the hands of Congress. 
Look how long ago this draft bill was presented. It has been 
sidetracked, and we have no hope that this law will be debated 
during this term of Congress. We will have to wait. 
  Nevertheless, we are going to meet with the defense minister 
and review the evidence the human rights ombudsman says he has 
in connection with certain cases. We agree that there have been 
anomalies. Nevertheless, the influx of volunteers to the 
military service over the past few months is incredible. You 
cannot imagine the number of young people who have signed up. 
In most departments, forceful conscription is unnecessary, and 
therefore we are surprised by these reports. We must accept, 
however, that these anomalies still take place, which is 
something the defense minister has accepted. We are going to 
meet with the High Command to analyze this situation and to take 
appropriate steps. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] No. No. Nothing of the sort. That is something 
that must be ruled out since we are still confronting a 
situation of armed internal conflict. Anyone who suggests 
eliminating the Army or refraining from upgrading or modernizing 
it is naive, because they are looking for us to remain without 
an Army at a time when subversive groups are still operating in 
the country. It is impossible to do that at this time. The 
Army is an issue that is included in the Constitution; in 
addition, the armed internal conflict is a reality. Acts of 
sabotage are still taking place. Yesterday they blew up an 
electricity tower in Esquintla and Taxisco. That proposal can 
be taken care of. 
  [Reporter] [word indistinct] 
  [De Leon] Keep in mind that military service is incorporated 
in Guatemala's political Constitution, and it is also every 
citizen's right and duty. The Constitution does not ask whether 
it should be done. It is a patriotic duty according to the 
constitutional norm that establishes it. When that is modified, 
then we can proceed to disband it. However, as long as it is 
not modified, it is the patriotic duty of every youth who has 
reached 18 years of age. 
  [Reporter] What programs were you referring to during your 
address in.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] In the United States? 
  [Reporter] Yes, that is correct. 
  [De Leon] That was a television program in the United 
States. Exactly what program, I can't recall. 
  [Reporter] What did you.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] By the way, I would like to say 
that, in this respect and despite the numerous problems the 
government has had, at this time it has been able to coordinate 
activities with representatives from the religious and the 
economic sectors. It was precisely the business sector that 
called my attention to this struggle against the television 
stations, or against the unjustified attacks that are being 
fabricated against Guatemala. In order words, efforts are 
currently being coordinated among the religious, military, and 
economic sectors. In this new phase we have had excellent 
relations with the business and workers sectors, always seeking 
common ground and avoiding confrontations. We are only awaiting 
the new Congress and the new Supreme Court in order to also 
begin a new relationship with the political sector. We are 
looking forward to a new National Congress, which will only be 
responsible to the Guatemalan people. We continue to abstain 
from interfering, because that is not my administration's 
policy. However, we do expect to maintain a relationship with 
the Legislative Branch in order to legislate -- even if it is in 
that congress' last year -- for the benefit of the Guatemalan 
people. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] in the conflict with Belize. 
Who are the ones causing it, and what is expected of it? 
  [De Leon] I do not know exactly.... [pauses] I just signed 
the agreement not long ago, but at this time I don't have the 
specific details at hand, or all the names. Rather than mislead 
you, I would rather give you the information afterwards. At any 
rate, the agreement has already been signed. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] During the next few days. We are only awaiting 
the return of Foreign Minister [Gladys Maritza Ruiz de] Vielman. 
She should be arriving at any time. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] you said that there are my 
sectors.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] No, I said that there are 
individuals 
who have proceeded to gather and form radical groups. 
Unfortunately these radical groups still exist. I have even 
mentioned, at one time or another, that the political will of 
some subversive groups within the URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] are not interested in peace. We do not 
know if they are prepared for it. We believe that they 
themselves may feel that they are not prepared and would 
possibly prefer to postpone the signing of a peace agreement. 
Even though these are radical groups, fortunately they are 
becoming a minority. 
  [Reporter] When will the peace agreement resume? 
  [De Leon] I understand that sometime at the end of this week 
both sides will again meet. The talks are scheduled to begin 
with discussions related to the issue of displaced people. 
After that they will travel to Oslo where talks will continue. 
  [Reporter] Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
  [De Leon] Thank you.

  [Text] The National Council on Belize [Consejo Nacional de 
Belize], CNB, was formally constituted yesterday after President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio signed a decree creating this consultative 
and advisory organization under the Foreign Ministry. 
  Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman will chair the CNB, 
and its members are: Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, Roberto 
Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Carriola, Edwin Fernando 
Guzman Ovalle, Alberto Herrarte Gonzalez, Roberto Herrera 
Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, Oscar 
Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Jorge Skinner 
Klee, and Francisco Villaran Kramer. These 12 individuals will 
be sworn in shortly. 
  The CNB was created by government Decree 259-94 that asserts 
that the territorial difference with Belize and the search for a 
solution that conforms to the Constitution's precepts is a 
matter of national interest. The purpose is to modernize and 
reorganize the CNB as a study, planning, consultative, and 
advisory office of the Foreign Ministry for everything related 
to the territorial disagreement with Belize. 
  According to the decree, the CNB will be authorized to 
appoint permanent or temporary commissions or sub-commissions as 
well as take the necessary measures to regulate their work. The 
decree will take effect when it is published in the official 
daily.

  [Text] The assessment of the first year of government 
can only be described as positive, Defense Minister Mario 
Rene Enriquez stated yesterday. 
  We have currently entered a phase in which social 
tranquillity and the return of peace is one of the 
administration's major achievements, realized through 
strengthening the constitutional system and respect for it, in 
order to make the law prevail in our country, the minister 
said. 
  He noted that the crisis the country experienced last year 
has not been totally overcome since the reasons that led to it 
still exist, adding that overcoming it will depend on the entire 
Guatemalan people. Even the peace process falls within this 
framework, he added, since every topic is being discussed with 
utmost seriousness, seeking to resolve the other parties' 
demands, which go beyond constitutional order. This does not 
mean, however, that there is no political commitment to sign an 
agreement to end the armed conflict, for which the reduction of 
the Army will be considered a necessity at the end of this 
century. 
  It is worth noting, he said, that peace in 
our country does not just constitute signing a document, rather 
meeting the economic needs of the majority of the people of 
Guatemala, combating extreme poverty until it is eradicated, and 
gradually overcoming the signs of an underdeveloped country. 
This government is establishing the bases to make this an 
irreversible reality for future governments. 
  He added that the current situation establishes a 
redefinition of the role the armed institution plays in 
Guatemalan society, since it is now in all areas of national 
territory, because, it goes without saying, this is the role the 
Constitution mandates.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Carlos Roberto Reina by reporters </F>
Roberto Reyes and Lourdes Bonilla at the Presidential Palace in 
Tegucigalpa; date not given --recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Reyes] Mr. President, there was an announcement 
to allow timber cutting, contradicting an Executive Branch order 
on this matter. 
  [Reina] A commission has been tasked with regulating the ban 
we announced. Anyone not abiding by our decision will be 
punished. 
  [Bonilla] There has also been talk regarding the charges by 
U.S. Senator Jesse Helms against Former President Rafael 
Leonardo Callejas. Will the Executive Branch support any action 
the prosecutor general may take to clarify the matter? 
  [Reina] You are posing two questions. One has to do with the 
letters the former president and Senator Helms have exchanged, 
which, as I said, is an interesting and important debate. The 
other question deals with our support for the prosecutor 
general; it is absolute. It is not easy to make a moral 
revolution. I want you to notice how attentive people are to any 
act of dishonesty. This is putting honesty in vogue. That is 
taking a step forward and is very positive. As for the former 
president, I will voice no opinion out of courtesy. 
  [Bonilla] Mr. President, is it true you have a document or 
that the U.S. Government or Senator Helms has forwarded to you 
documents outlining the involvement of Former President Callejas 
in acts of corruption. 
  [Reina] I can clearly tell you that I have not received that 
document. 
  [Reyes] [Words indistinct] there were reportedly illegal 
actions? 
  [Reina] Anyone violating the law in this country will be 
punished. I have announced that in all my speeches. I said I 
will put an end to impunity. I am asking you to help in that 
task of making a moral revolution. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Erica Ramirez; from the "National" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government has announced the publication, in the 
next few days, of laws reached by consensus in the National 
Assembly to reinforce the value of compensation bonds. As for 
statements by Congressman Robert Torricelli, Presidency Minister 
Antonio Lacayo said that U.S. aid is in no way in jeopardy. 
  Minister Lacayo said that, as soon as the laws to reinforce 
bond values and on the privatization of Telcor [Nicaraguan 
Telecommunications and Postal Services Institute] are published, 
it will become evident once again that the domestic compensation 
system is moving in the right direction. He added that 
Torricelli's statements are in keeping with his duty as a U.S. 
congressman: 
  [Begin recording] [Lacayo] That is his work, to ensure that 
in Nicaragua we remain on this path to maintain excellent 
relations with the United States. But that does not imply that 
the aid is in jeopardy. I want to clarify that the aid is not 
in jeopardy. We are very confident with what we have done since 
1990 in this regard. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] also has congressmen friends 
in 
the United States. Do you believe that the government will not 
need to implement a diplomat strategy or visit Washington to 
ensure that the aid is not jeopardized or that the amendment is 
not enforced? 
  [Lacayo] We must show that our domestic process works. To 
ensure this we need to reinforce our bond system. We already 
have many alternatives in this regard, and we are presently 
working on this. We are trying to reach consensus agreements 
with the National Assembly. We must show that cases continue to 
be settled. Three or four cases that are important to them were 
settled recently. Two, three, four, five, or as many cases as 
possible will be settled next week involving not only U.S. 
citizens, but also Spaniards, Germans, and so on. [end 
recording] 
  As for the plans of certain workers to block the 
privatization of Telcor, he pointed out that this privatization 
is a strategic need for the country in order to obtain resources 
and compensate those who were unjustly confiscated: 
  [Begin Lacayo recording] Those opposing the privatization of 
Telcor will oppose the distribution of title deeds and oppose 
the legalization process. In other words, they would oppose the 
entire Sandinist leadership's wishes that they have voiced to 
us. They would also contradict the wishes of the entire 
leadership of the former UNO [National Opposition Unity] 
political parties and the wishes of a great majority of our 
country. In other words, they have no representation, because a 
majority of the people want title deeds issued to the new 
beneficiaries, and they want compensation paid to those who had 
property unjustly confiscated. Two birds will be killed with 
one stone: the privatization of Telcor. [end recording] 
  Minister Lacayo added that Nicaragua is the country that has 
settled the most cases. So far, he added, 117 properties owned 
by U.S. citizens have been settled, that is, 42 percent of the 
total. USAID recently offered support to continue the 
compensation process, and this shows that the government of 
President Chamorro is indeed solving a problem it inherited.

<F P=106> [Report by Aura Lila Moreno] </F>
  [Text] General Humberto Ortega has charged that extreme 
right-wing sectors are waging a "terrorist campaign of lies" 
against the draft Military Code he presented before the National 
Assembly. The Assembly will be discussing the draft next week, 
before the consultation process with all sectors of Nicaraguan 
society. 
  "We are facing a battle," Gen. Ortega exclaimed before 500 
officers, who were receiving their military promotions. Present 
for the event were members of the Military Council of the Army, 
Navy, and Air Force diplomatic attaches, National Police 
commanders, and Government Minister Frank Cesar. 
  During the promotion ceremony, which took place under a 
heavy 
rainfall at the Alejandro Davila Bolanos Military Hospital, Gen. 
Ortega addressed the military modernization process. He also 
spoke out against the "destabilization campaign, which is being 
promoted by conservative and reactionary currents," against the 
debate over the Military Code at the Assembly. 
  The commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] 
argued that "attacking the Army, in the irresponsible way some 
sectors are now doing, can only promote instability and violent 
confrontation among Nicaraguans." He reaffirmed that the armed 
organization is facing a "campaign of terrorism and lies." 
  The EPS, considered the youngest military in Latin America, 
will celebrate its 15th anniversary in September. According to 
Ortega, there would have been no election in 1990 and "President 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro would never have won the presidency" 
if it were not for the EPS. 
  "With the Somozist Guard there would have been no election, 
as there had been no elections for over 40 years of Somozist 
domination. With a counterrevolutionary army there would never 
have been a Violeta Barrios," Ortega stated, and he added that 
there would be no process of broad political liberties, "despite 
the extremes that process sometimes allows." 
  The military leader said he is convinced that with a 
Somozist 
Guard or a counterrevolutionary army there would be no space for 
any Sandinist, Social Christian, Independent Liberal, or 
Conservative who did not submit to the kind of oppression and 
domination "that we knew during the 40 years of the National 
Guard and capitalism, and their conservative and reactionary 
line of thought. It is that way of thinking that is 
irresponsibly causing the destabilization campaign of today." 
  About the "talk-a-thon" sponsored by a local extremist radio 
station, Ortega said we can attack an institution that is the 
"spearhead of an effort to strengthen the democratic system," 
but we cannot sponsor a talk-a-thon to condemn the vandals, 
kidnappers, and bandits that terrorize the peasants and scare 
investors away." 
  The military leader assured that "the army is under attack 
simply because it is not the army of the recalcitrants -- the 
reactionary political forces -- who have not even read the law 
we sent to the National Assembly for approval." 
  For Ortega, those who are staging the campaign against the 
military organization and the Military Code do not care if the 
Army is a factor for stability or not, nor if it has respect for 
civilian authority. On that line, he asked several questions 
about some of the charges being made against the EPS. 
  "How many times has any of our officers tried to meddle in 
the government's decisions? How many times has any of our units 
meddled in any political activity of the civilian authority or 
at the National Assembly? How often has the high command tried 
to intervene in party politics? What Army resource -- large, 
medium, or small -- has tried to compete with the private sector? 
  Ortega, consequently, stated that the promoters of the 
"terrorist campaign" do not want the army "simply because it is 
not a Somozist or counterrevolutionary army that follows a 
reactionary line of thought," not because it is or is not 
efficient. 
  Ortega believes "it is truly irresponsible to ignite an 
already explosive situation." He stressed that "today, more 
than ever before, the members of the armed institution must be 
aware not to surrender to provocation." 
  The high military commander underscored that "united, more 
than ever before, we will march on with the weapons that history 
legitimately placed in our hands by way of the 1979 revolution; 
with the weapons we will legitimately hold as of today, by way 
of the Military Code." He concluded, saying: "With or without 
the law, the Army will continue to exist."

  [Excerpt] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that 
"Panama must insist" on Cuba's reentry into the OAS, as has been 
suggested by other countries of the region. 
  Endara said that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to take 
place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 14 and 15 June, "will 
not address the Cuban situation." 
  According to Endara, the chiefs of state "have met with 
Castro at other summit meetings, to seek ways to democratize the 
island" and have been unsuccessful for the last 30 years. 
  Whenever the issue is addressed, Endara said, "Castro always 
approaches the discussion in a rational and open way, as the 
dignified and responsible person that he is." 
  The Panamanian leader said he has spoken many times with the 
Cuban statesman, whom he finds to be "an exceptional individual, 
despite the political differences" that separate the two 
presidents. [passage omitted]

Reports" Newscast] 
  [Text] President Guillermo Endara will travel abroad and 
will leave Vice President Guillermo Ford in charge of the Palace 
of the Herons, in keeping with the Constitution and a decision 
made during a Cabinet Council meeting. 
  The formal ceremony was held at the Presidency. President 
Guillermo Endara placed the presidential sash on Vice President 
Guillermo Ford, who will be president for 11 days. In the 
presence of ranking officials of the three state branches, the 
president said that he is leaving power in good hands as he 
travels abroad. 
  [Begin Endara recording] These summits are perhaps the most 
important international events that a president can attend, 
because I will not only meet but also hold talks privately and 
publicly with my colleagues from all of Latin America, Spain, 
and Portugal. [end recording] 
  Endara will head for Costa Rica where he will fine tune 
details of a proposal that he refused to elaborate on. He said 
that it will be presented at the Fourth Ibero-American summit. 
He will then travel to Cartagena de Indias where this summit 
will be held on 14- 15 June. 
  Meanwhile, Guillermo Ford said that he will maintain the 
country while Endara is abroad and added that he is indebted to 
the Panamanian people. 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Mr. President, what will be 
done in these 11 days? What are your plans for this period? 
  [Ford] I do not want people to have exceedingly high 
expectations because 11 days is a very short period. First, I 
am responsible for maintaining peace and tranquillity in the 
country. Second, I have a few programs that will benefit the 
most needy classes. I prefer not to give details at this time 
because we will be working on them this afternoon and tomorrow. 
I want to create some optimism for the people. The best raw 
material available to this country is its people. Thus, we must 
offer them some benefits and the tools to help them take off. 
[end recording] 
  Guillermo Ford, then, is occupying the presidency. He will 
enjoy the same powers that the president has. After the fourth 
summit, Endara will travel to Argentina along with Argentine 
President Carlos Menem on an official visit.

<F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] After two weeks, the contentious Bill No. 41 is 
still on the Legislative Assembly's agenda. The bill seeks to 
reform laws related to intellectual property. A group of 
lawyers considers the bill to have serious flaws because it was 
not proposed by the Executive or Judicial Branches as stipulated 
by the Constitution. 
  [Begin lawyer Alvaro Cedeno recording] First, this law is 
unconstitutional. According to our Constitution, a law of this 
nature has to be proposed by the Executive Branch. Furthermore, 
this law annuls articles, chapters, and entire sections of our 
codes. Laws that annul or modify national codes are organic 
laws, and they, specifically the ones that annul our codes, have 
to be proposed by either the Supreme Court, the attorney 
general, or the solicitor general. [end recording] 
  Lawyer Cedeno said that the bill had been proposed by a 
Legislative Assembly commission and that it was not empowered to 
do so by the Constitution. This, he added, is another factor 
that makes the bill under discussion unconstitutional. The bill 
attempts to create a confiscation penalty, and the criminal code 
indicates that a confiscation is an accessory penalty. The 
bill, thus, violates the pretrial concept, Cedeno observed. 
  [Begin Cedeno recording] Apparently, the law intends to give 
authors protection. [end recording] 
  Cedeno said he would promote protests from several sectors 
if 
the legislators insist on passing this bill.

<F P=106> [Report by Yuriela Sagel] </F>
  [Text] Major Santiago Fundora, National Air Service (SAN) 
director, pointed out yesterday that drug traffickers are 
looking for new routes to conduct their drug activity in the 
national territory. He also confirmed the existence of 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] guerrillas in the 
border region with Darien. 
  Fundora indicated that, given the pressures the National 
Police are exerting on international drug traffickers, the 
traffickers are looking for new areas to bring drugs into the 
nation, thereby continuing the trafficking process. Fundora 
said this is the reason authorities often refuse to disclose 
information on operations to eradicate and to prevent drug 
trafficking activities. 
  According to the SAN director, the traffickers work around 
the clock and they relocate very easily to other sites to 
continue their trafficking. Fundora made these statements 
during a meeting with directors of various state security 
organizations. The objective of the meeting was to discuss new 
strategies to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and 
crime. 
  Fundora confirmed the presence of FARC guerrillas in the 
Darien territory, and he stressed that more vigilance in this 
zone is needed because of the FARC presence. Fundora added that 
the National Government must increase the number of Border 
Police units and it must supply them with better equipment to 
conduct their work. 
  The government must make efforts to combat piracy on the 
seas, drug trafficking activities, and crime in the capital, 
Fundora noted. He added that the ghost of militarism should 
disappear and that members of the National Police should be 
properly equipped to perform their duties more effectively. 
  Fundora also suggested more drastic measures to combat crime 
and international drug trafficking, such as 30-year sentences. 
He also suggested that guards whose participation is proven in 
the escape of drug traffickers should be forced to pay for the 
pending sentence. If this were implemented, the system would 
change, he noted. 
  Citizens must cooperate by informing the police when they 
know about the location of drug sales, otherwise, youths will 
continue to be caught in the drug net, Fundora reiterated.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Venezuelan Government will send aid to Colombia, 
where an avalanche razed eight towns in that country's southeast 
on 6 June. 
  There is no decision yet on what to do with 35 Venezuelan 
families affected by the storm Bret and who are staying at Fort 
Tiuna, but the Venezuelan Government has already decided to send 
aid to the victims of the tremor in Colombia. Foreign Minister 
Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas has announced our country will assist 
with 100 prefabricated houses for the families who lost their 
homes. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] Armed Forces airplanes will be 
going. Helicopters may also go to see how we can help. 
Contributions in this case do not involve medicine, blankets, 
and medical teams composed of doctors and nurses, as is usually 
the case. What is needed now is the reestablishment of 
communications, electricity, and housing for those who have been 
left completely destitute. [end recording] 
  Burelli has also said no Haitians are coming to Venezuela. 
He has said reports on the arrival of 120 people from Haiti are 
the product of a lively imagination. 
  Evidently contradicting what was said last week following a 
meeting with Strobe Talbott, U.S. deputy secretary of State, the 
foreign minister has now said the number of undesirable 
immigrants, who are causing problems in the country and 
intensifying the social and economic drama Venezuelans are 
enduring, will not increase. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] This is the government's position. 
I do not know the origin of the report on a certain group of 
Haitians and their plight; this has never existed. We very much 
want to help Haiti, and we help it at international forums. We 
have a historical commitment. Recall that Simon Bolivar was 
able to successfully and definitively return to Venezuela to 
produce its independence thanks to help provided by Haitian 
General Alexander Petion. Anything else is false. [end 
recording] 
  In conclusion, the minister has announced that on occasion 
of 
the Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 
13 June the Group of Three [Colombia, Mexico, Venezuela] will 
sign a free trade agreement that will count on the participation 
of businessmen from the three countries to give practical 
significance to the integration system.

  [Text] The staggered transportation strikes were suspended 
once the government appointed a commission to mediate the 
conflict. This was reported by Simon Ladera, president of the 
Union of Independent Vehicles, who added that the union's 
intention is not to exert any type of pressure on the 
commission. Thus, there is a 10-day truce in the strike. 
Ladera asserted that the suspension of the strike is not a 
reaction to the Transportation and Communication Ministry's 
alleged threats to revoke independent vehicle licenses. The 
union leader also recommended that Interior Minister Ramon 
Escovar Salom take charge of security or, better yet, that he 
should take charge of the insecurity in the country because more 
drivers are being killed by criminals every day and the 
government is taking no steps to end the situation.

afternoon at the Miraflores drug store, located less than 50 
meters from the presidential palace and next to the Weapons and 
Explosives Directorate of the Interior Ministry. According to 
information obtained at the site, someone left a dark brown 
briefcase at approximately 1400, when the drug store is most 
crowded. The store clerks became suspicious and called the 
Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services for help. 
Officials from the Weapons and Explosives Directorate arrived 
and took the necessary measures. After x-raying the briefcase, 
they decided to detonate the explosive device. At this time, 
the authorities do not know who is responsible for this new 
terrorist action which could have caused injuries and damage 
near the presidential palace.

  [Text] This morning, two inmates from El Marite Prison were 
taken to Maracaibo's University Hospital. Upon arriving at the 
medical center, a commando group intercepted the policemen 
escorting the inmates in an attempt to free them. A shootout 
ensued and, unfortunately, a student was shot and killed. Masin 
Chirino Serrano, 23, was a student at the Biology School of the 
University of Zulia. She died immediately. 
  As a result of this death, university and secondary school 
students began demonstrations that turned into angry riots in 
the school of engineering, medicine, and sociology and on 
Cecilio Acosta and Delicias Avenues. The riots so far have 
resulted in eight private sector trucks being burned. 
  The disturbances continued until this Friday afternoon when 
Zulia State Governor Lolita Anillar de Castro ordered the 
militarization of the unversity area. Fortunately, there is no 
report of any other student casualties. At this moment, 
however, students are still shouting slogans. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified person] We have noticed 
that 
since this government took power, insecurity has increased in 
our region. How can it be that the police, instead of being in 
the neighborhoods fighting criminals, are here killing students 
who have something to offer the country? [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Ramon Escovar </F>
Salom by Olgalinda Pimentel in Caracas, date not given; first 
seven paragraphs are author's introduction] 
  [Text] 
Certainly, Ramon Escovar Salom is not concerned that people say 
that he is still talking and acting like the attorney general. 
  About two months ago he took over the Ministry of Interior 
Relations in Carmelitas. He wants to free Venezuelan politics of 
that "old-fashioned attitude which many governments have had" of 
hardening their positions on their own mistakes and of not 
wanting to tell the truth. He said: "How am I going to say that 
a thing is, when it is not?" 
  Therefore, he set up his office in the building inaugurated 
by General Eleazar Lopez Contreras in 1936, not only ordering 
the worn, red rugs to be cleaned but also having his office 
"swept" to detect electronic listening devices. From that office 
he stated unambiguously that the country has no money, that 
succeeding governments have not given priority to personal 
security, and that Venezuela has no clear idea of what its 
position is on the narcotics traffic. 
  Furthermore, he intends to redefine the powers of the 
Ministry of Interior Relations which, until now, has been the 
center for bad relations and repression. He wants the ministry 
to regain its powers as a government department from high level 
politics. He said: "I am trying to ensure that democratic 
institutions function properly." The personal security of the 
ordinary citizen is the fundamental objective of his official 
policy of state security. 
  He stated: "The security of all citizens and the right to 
life are not adequately guaranteed in Venezuela. I must say 
that, despite the fact that there are some people who say that I 
am talking like the attorney general. No, I am speaking as a 
government minister and I have to tell the truth. No government 
should have any problem in recognizing that." 
  He stated that the subject of personal security is "very 
complex," because several factors are involved which do not 
depend on the government. However, the government must clearly 
play its role. He said: "The first point which comes to mind is 
that priority has not been given to personal security. We have 
always tried to excuse this omission by saying that elsewhere in 
the world, in New York, Lima, or Bogota, more people are killed 
than here. And I always say that this is like the person who 
says that someone drowned in water two meters deep, while 
another person drowned in water four meters deep. In any case 
they drowned, and it makes no difference." 
  He argues that there are countries which successfully fight 
against crime by bringing society as a whole and the ordinary 
citizen into the struggle, because, "governments and police 
forces cannot do the job by themselves. Society must learn to 
defend itself. Clearly, there is a negative factor here, the 
absence of police in the streets. However, the first thing which 
the present government did was to bring the police out into the 
streets. If this is not possible, then there is the National 
Guard. That is quite clear. It is also clear that the police by 
themselves are not enough. They have many shortcomings. It is 
also true that there are police who are involved in the rackets. 
This problem is being dealt with, however. Some women friends of 
mine even telephone me at home at night to complain of things 
that are going on. Then I call the Metropolitan Police, even 
though it may be nearly midnight. They are used to my calling 
them at such a time to ask about some things. That is what we 
are doing." 
  [Pimentel] What would you do if insecurity continues? Do we 
have to take repressive action to deal with the problem because 
we have not been able to develop a crime prevention policy? 
  [Escovar] It is true that there has not been a policy of 
preventing crime. Repression is inevitable if there is no 
program for preventing crime. The fact that the police are in 
the streets does not automatically mean that we are following a 
policy of repression. The presence of the police is a sign of 
authority, as in any other part of the world. However, that does 
not mean that human rights are being violated. I do not support 
breaches of the law. 
  [Pimentel] How will you combine the necessary amount of 
repression with your own training which once led you, as a 
prosecutor, to say that there is no government of laws in 
Venezuela? 
  [Escovar] I am trying to make sure that the criticisms which 
I expressed as a prosecutor, and now take into consideration as 
a minister, might correct a considerable number of mistakes. One 
of my criticisms is that you have to educate the police. I have 
sent instructions to state and city governments to that effect. 
The instructions given to the police in the past have always 
been repressive, aggressive, and authoritarian in tone. Why not 
give them democratic instructions? Let them exercise their 
authority. I am not pretending that the police are weaklings. 
They have to exercise their authority, particularly in such a 
violent city as Caracas, where they are exposed to being blown 
away with the wind. They have to be a solid instrument of order, 
but they do not necessarily have to harm the personal security 
of the ordinary citizen. 
  [Pimentel] Is that the approach which you plan to use with 
the MRI [Ministry of Interior Relations]? 
  [Escovar] That is the approach which I am using, and I would 
like to emphasize other weapons which the Ministry of Interior 
Relations has which do not exclusively deal with security, 
although, of course, that is the most important element. I am 
not going to criticize my predecessors in this position because 
I am not going to become involved in that kind of discussion. 
What I want to do is to redefine and reformulate the role of the 
Ministry of Interior Relations as a ministry of government and 
of politics. There are many public opinion groups which should 
feel that they are being heard and respected. It is very 
probable that later on I will present a plan for the 
reorganization of the ministry for consideration by the 
government. 
  We should remember, however, that state and municipal 
governments have their own responsibilities. If a gun goes off 
in a city square, this does not mean that the minister of 
interior relations ordered it. You can establish order without 
firing guns into the air. There are other means of repression, 
such as antiriot teams. You cannot expect Caracas to be a 
goody-goody city, and the government does not expect that it 
will be, either. The government has to exercise its democratic 
authority in a vigorous and firm way. 
<H5>  Doors Which Open and Close </H5>
  Escovar Salom does not believe that we face great 
difficulties. He recalls the great political tensions which he 
dealt with when he was the young director of the Faculty of Law 
at the UCV [Central University of Venezuela] after the fall of 
the Perez Jimenez government. The door which connected the 
Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Humanities had been sealed. He 
called a doorman and ordered him to open it. He explained that 
this was quite a revolution and an enormous change in the 
concept of university space. He said: "For example, there are 
many doors which open and others which close. There are still 
others which are unjustifiably open." 
  [Pimentel] In terms of state security the Ministry of 
Interior Relations has two organizations within it which have 
always been attacked because of their practices: the DIEX 
[Directorate of Identification and Alien Affairs] and the DISIP 
[Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services]. What are 
you going to do with them? 
  [Escovar] I have always spoken in very critical terms 
against 
the DIEX. I have been told that nothing can be done about it. 
There is general pessimism on this subject. The first thing that 
you have to do is to identify the sources of corruption, because 
not all officials in the DIEX are corrupt. I once asked the 
members of the ministry trade union, who came to me and offered 
their cooperation, to help me in cleaning up the DIEX. I wanted 
to bring the members of the trade union into this job and give 
them a motive for doing so. Of course, the sources of corruption 
in DIEX do not like this, nor do they like computers, because 
office automation, using computers, is an enemy of corruption. 
It prevents officials from acting secretly. 
  DIEX needs cleaning up, organization, and automation. How 
are 
we dealing with the automation of DIEX during this period of 
difficulties? I am studying the possibility of private 
contributions and turning the DIEX into an independent agency 
which could finance itself with its own resources. However, I 
have not yet made a decision because I am still analyzing 
whether this course of action is viable and what legal 
difficulties there may be. 
  At the moment I have asked neighborhood associations to help 
me to investigate DIEX. I am going to install two telephones in 
the ministry to receive complaints from the public. The 
telephone numbers will be made public soon. The person answering 
the telephone in the ministry will have to give his name so that 
the complainant will know whom to contact or to call again if 
his complaint is not dealt with. That service is being 
organized, and an announcement concerning it will be made 
shortly. In DIEX we have to carry out a psychological revolution 
to treat the public properly. I am going to send some experts to 
tell people in DIEX that they should learn to say, "Good 
morning," "with pleasure," and "please." 
  [Pimentel] Do you think that, beyond the matter of behavior 
which you hope to change, the problem is also structural, 
involving bureaucratic practices such as collecting money for 
services rendered, gift giving in exchange for services, and 
bribery? 
  [Escovar] It is true that in Venezuela the administration is 
an obstacle course. And not only in the DIEX. This is a country 
where it takes an effort to do anything. In the DIEX we have to 
find out how many employees are not needed. We have to make a 
personnel audit and find out which employees are involved in 
corruption. This is something which is now being done. The other 
task is to protect the decent and honest people who work there, 
because at times those scoundrels represent the honest people, 
silence them, and prevent them from doing their job. In this 
area we are going to face the collective will of the ministry. I 
am inclined to do that. We are going to see what the results 
will be. 
  [Pimentel] Do you think that in this way you will be able to 
control illegal and undocumented immigration which you have 
criticized so much? 
  [Escovar] The DIEX is a fundamental instrument of national 
sovereignty. Those activities are a crime of treason to the 
fatherland. The official involved in that kind of activity can 
be brought to trial. I have a clear position regarding the 
matter of undocumented aliens. They cannot live in Venezuela. In 
some cases there will have to be deportations, and I am ready 
for that. Now, there are people who are illegal because they 
have not been provided with the necessary documents, but they 
are working. Cattle raisers in certain border areas have raised 
that matter with me. However, the problem is in the illegal and 
criminal element in the population. Venezuela has to have a 
border policy but also a policy of selective immigration. In 
this connection population policy has been confused with the 
open door policy. Although there are no reliable statistics, I 
believe that in Caracas there may be about two million 
undocumented aliens. This is one of the open doors which must be 
closed. 
  [Pimentel] And what about the DISIP? 
  [Escovar] We are doing the same thing with the DISIP. We are 
reorganizing it. Gen. Rivas Ostos (the director) is doing a 
quiet but efficient job. The DISIP is a state security police 
service, but it does not have to be the Gestapo, nor does it 
have to be violent or aggressive. This is a police force which 
does not work for a political party or even the government, but 
rather the Venezuelan state. That is the first thing that we 
have to make clear. In Venezuela many people do not know that 
the notion of a state is a permanent aspect of the national 
community, while governments are transitory phenomena. In the 
DISIP I am trying to apply the principle of identifying a 
government official with the state. Previously, this 
relationship was expressed in personal terms. The individual 
official served interests which were not those of the Venezuelan 
state. And I will not go on with this because a great deal is 
already known about it and I do not need to repeat it. 
  [Pimentel] Regarding secret appropriations, when you were 
attorney general, you said that these should be regulated. Do 
you still think the same way? 
  [Escovar] The existing standards are the same. I contacted 
the Office of the Controller General and asked it to suggest 
what possible regulations might be applied. The important thing 
to remember is that in the law establishing the Office of the 
Controller General certain powers are given to the controller 
general and eventually to the attorney general to exercise 
supervision of the secret appropriations. Secret appropriations 
cannot be a well from which funds can be drawn for all purposes. 
Historically, it has been a means of providing welfare benefits 
in exchange for certain favors. The appropriations for welfare 
purposes do not have to be secret. They should be publicly 
known. There could be further regulations on this matter. 
<H5>  Standing Still on a Pile of Rubble </H5>
  Escovar Salom answered at least three telephone calls on his 
internal office phone in less than one hour. These were 
government matters which he had to deal with from his office. He 
said that he works 11 hours a day and, "as was the case in the 
Office of the Attorney General," he takes no time off for lunch. 
From time to time he adds to the volume of his recording of the 
musical, "Gypsy," by playing his violin. 
  [Pimentel] The narcotics traffic is another problem 
affecting 
state security. How are you going to deal with it? 
  [Escovar] The narcotics traffic is a new element on the 
scene, and you have to know how to deal with it. (He wanted to 
clear up some misunderstandings on the subject.) It is not a 
matter of making concessions. Rather, this is a very serious 
matter which has to be considered. The geopolitics of drugs 
presupposes international activities. States as such do not have 
the means of dealing with a crime which is essentially 
international in scope. Of course, there is a policy of 
prevention and of education in dealing with drugs. However, the 
basic problem is how to act from the executive point of view 
against the narcotics traffic and related money laundering. 
  It seems to me that so far Venezuela has not had a clear 
idea 
of its position on this matter. More or less sporadic efforts 
have been made. There are some cases in the courts, but nothing 
coherent or coordinated has been done about the matter. Perhaps, 
later on, it might become necessary to establish a special state 
agency, a specialized and autonomous body, such as the DEA [Drug 
Enforcement Administration] in the United States. One very 
important aspect is the laundering of narcotics profits, but 
here we have begun with the error of believing that this is not 
going on. That kind of business has been growing almost in 
public view, but no one realized it. There are even people who 
are offended when you mention it. Why should we deny this fact 
if it is a reality? 
  In passing Escovar presented some views which he had 
previously expressed at the SECONASEDE conference [National 
Development Conference]. He said that "some alleged patriots and 
persons of ill will" quoted him as saying that Venezuela could 
not take action on this matter. He said: "What I said -- and I 
said so as minister of foreign affairs in about 1976 -- was that 
Venezuela should keep clearly in mind that it is a small country 
and should understand that this is what it is. It is better for 
Venezuela to keep clearly in mind that it is an efficient and 
productive country with political skills -- because political 
skill is also one of our assets -- and that it has the 
literature and the rhetorical skills of a large country. It is 
very expensive to be a large country. Venezuela is not big 
enough to be that." 
  He received a telephone call from someone very close to him 
who apparently congratulated him on his appointment. The 
minister purred into his phone, "That's a two-edged compliment 
that you are paying me." 
  [Pimentel] Are you afraid of "burning out" in the Ministry 
of 
Interior Relations? 
  [Escovar] When I entered the Office of the Attorney General, 
they said something like that. None of the people who called me 
to pass on their greetings did so to congratulate me but rather 
to express their condolences and to wish me luck. Neither did 
public opinion expect much. I crossed the border between 
skepticism and a certain amount of hope in November 1989, when I 
began to visit hospitals. This was something different. However, 
clearly enough, there are always jealous people and pessimists. 
They are not always the same people, but they exist. They used 
to say that visiting hospitals was not the job of the attorney 
general. 
  They said the same thing when I began by winning certain 
cases, not only the Carlos Andres Perez case on 11 March but 
also other, previous cases. I knew at the time that Carlos 
Andres Perez had called a very important businessman in Caracas 
and told him that what I had presented in court was nonsense and 
that the basis of my case was merely press clippings. He said: 
"That is very difficult." A friend told me on 18 April 1993: 
"Anyhow, I wish you success in that job, but this country is not 
yet ready for that." Almost one month later, on 20 May, the CSJ 
[Supreme Court of Justice] made a favorable finding on the 
previous judgment against Carlos Andres Perez, who was then 
president. 
  [Pimentel] Are we a country of pessimists? 
  [Escovar] I am used to that kind of pessimism. However, in 
the ministry I am going to do the same thing and I have no doubt 
that I will be successful. I am going to have many difficulties, 
which already have begun, like the skepticism of the people. 
Friends tell me: "Why did you leave your job as a lawyer 
handling cases before the UN, with a salary of $14,000 a month 
and with so many privileges, to come back and get involved in 
this mess? You should have gone away and waited for a future 
opportunity." But standing aside and waiting for the right 
opportunity is like a man with new shoes who does not put them 
on so that the soles will not wear out. If I speak up, I speak 
up, as I did in the Office of the Attorney General. Everything 
is very difficult now in Venezuela because we are still standing 
on a mountain of rubble. That is what we have inherited, and we 
have to work on that. There is nothing else to do." 
<H5>  Biographic Details </H5>
  Escovar Salom's biography states that he was the youngest 
parliamentarian in Latin America in 1948 (when he was 21). He 
was the youngest senator in 1958 (when he was 31) and the 
youngest cabinet minister in 1964 (when he was 38). Since then 
he began work in the executive branch of the government as 
minister of justice. He was secretary general of the Office of 
the President of the Republic (1974-75) and minister of foreign 
affairs (1975-77) during the first term of President Carlos 
Andres Perez. Then he was Venezuelan ambassador to France 
(1986-89). Until February 1994 he was attorney general. 
  Now, as minister of interior relations, he is a member of 
the 
cabinet of President Rafael Caldera. His experience as one of 
the drafters of the national constitution (of 1961) now in 
effect and as titular professor of constitutional law seems to 
him to be a good reason for expressing the view that 
constitutional reform should be the result of a broad and also 
harmonious consensus, because the constitution of 1961 "got away 
from us." He said: "Because we wanted to draft a good 
constitution in the sense of stability we moved too far toward 
rigidity." 
  He suggests that reform should be oriented more toward the 
way in which the national government functions, toward the 
organic part of the constitution, and toward seeking 
alternatives to political crises which end up in coups d'etat. 
He firmly believes that the idea of holding a referendum to 
recall a president is not a bad one. Everything depends on the 
electorate's being clearly prepared to deal with the situations 
which come up. He is not opposed to a dissolution of Congress. 
He said: "In democratic countries this is a power which the 
serving prime minister does not make use of every day. Except in 
very serious situations, I consider that the electorate should 
be consulted."

  [Text] The national government has rejected the comments 
made in Iran against Alirio Parra, our candidate for the post of 
OPEC secretary general. According to reports from this Middle 
East nation, the Iranians will not vote for Parra because he 
allegedly is close to the Saudi (Ahmad Laki Jammani), who is an 
adviser in his Economic Investigation Center. The Iranian 
source added that this country will present its own candidate, 
Kazem Pur Ardebili, at the next OPEC elections. The communique 
issued by the national government regretted speculations about 
the former energy and mines minister and added that Alirio Parra 
has the support of 11 of the 12 OPEC member countries.

  [Text] Caracas -- "It is the duty of the international 
community to resolve the problem in Haiti. OAS member countries 
that signed human rights declarations cannot allow a gang of 
military men to brazenly continue to violate these principles in 
the name of an orthodox sovereignty concept of the past 
century." Marco Tullio Celli, the UN Human Rights Committee 
observer specially appointed to follow the tragedy of thousands 
of people persecuted by the coupist Haitian regime, thus 
preaches intervention in Haiti. During an interview with JORNAL 
DO BRASIL, Celli said he is sure the OAS meeting in Belem do 
Para will offer the appropriate framework to allow OAS members 
to face this problem once and for all and apply the Chilean 
Resolution. This resolution favors democracy. It was approved 
three months before the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide and establishes procedures for collective decisions 
whenever the institutional order is interrupted in any country 
on the American continent. 
  Celli said OAS country members cannot forget that the coup 
in 
Haiti represents disrespect for a decision made a few months 
earlier by Latin American countries, and represents the 
beginning of a process that could jeopardize democracy in the 
region. During their latest visit to Haiti, Human Rights 
Committee representatives verified 133 cases of illegal 
executions last February and March alone. During a two-month 
period, 55 people were kidnapped (11 were killed and 24 are 
missing). International observers also verified the existence 
of mutilated bodies in Port-au-Prince as well as the rape of 
women and children by members of the civilian militias who were 
armed by the military men. 
  Celli said: "What is the cost of the policy so far conducted 
by the OAS and the UN in Haiti? At least 4,000 murders!" He 
demands from the international community more than political and 
economic sanctions against the Haitian regime. Celli believes 
the plan to shelter Haitian refugees is also doomed to fail. 
"If everyone there is persecuted and the government maintains a 
regime of terror, what are we doing receiving 1,000 or 2,000 
refugees? The repression will continue. The solution to the 
Haitian problem is to rebuild a government that can offer the 
people security." He believes there are conditions for 
intervention in the island. "The military threat to call the 
people to stage a national rebellion against an eventual 
occupation is not true. The Haitian Army is very small -- it 
has 7,000 men, of which 5,000 are in Port-au-Prince. If the 
capital is occupied, the whole country is occupied. The idea is 
to maintain in Haiti some advisers to modernize the Haitian 
Armed Forces and to help lead the country through a democratic 
process." 
  Finally, Marco Tullio Celli has a message for those who 
still 
believe in a policy of half measures. "Above everything, 
everybody must understand that Haitian sovereignty is not at 
stake. Those who resort to this argument merely favor a group 
of military men who mercilessly massacre people. Intervening in 
Haiti does not represent an invasion. It is liberation," Celli 
said.

  [Text] Belem -- Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said 
yesterday at the 24th OAS General Assembly that Brazil supports 
a peaceful solution to ending the military dictatorship of 
Haiti. Amorim suggested intensifying the economic boycott 
against Haiti, including the prohibition of flights: "Although 
Brazil cannot tolerate the military coup that overthrew 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, it recommends a peaceful 
solution in favor of democracy, and in keeping with the 
principle of nonintervention." 
  Argentina asked for an immediate military intervention in 
Haiti, arguing that it no longer believes in the positive 
effects of the sanctions against Haiti. The Brazilian foreign 
minister believes that if the boycott is intensified, the 
coupist Haitian military officers will not be able to resist for 
long: "After President Aristide, who obtained 70 percent of the 
votes, is reinstated in power, Brazil would find it advisable 
for the United Nations to send a peace force to that country to 
safeguard democracy, but not a military intervention." 
  The Brazilian foreign minister believes that firmer action 
against the Haitian coupists has not been possible so far, but 
that favorable conditions are now arising. Amorim defended the 
readmission of Cuba to the OAS, saying that the situation there 
is different from that in Haiti: "Now that the era and 
consequences of the Cold War are over, there is no reason to 
isolate Cuba given that an evolution toward freedom can now be 
observed there, even though it is not taking place at the 
desired pace. The situation in Haiti is different: Human 
rights are brazenly violated there."

  [Text] Belem -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
last night signed a protocol whereby Brazil adheres to the OAS 
Convention on Human Rights and the Abolition of Capital 
Punishment, which was signed in Asuncion, Paraguay, in June 
1990. Brazil was the sixth country to sign the protocol, thus 
reaffirming its commitment to refrain from adopting the death 
penalty. 
  Amorim said that in addition to strengthening democracy, the 
protocol ensures peaceful coexistence among countries and 
respect for human rights. The protocol still requires approval 
by the Brazilian Congress. The protocol will not become 
mandatory until the congresses of two-thirds of the OAS member 
countries have ratified the convention. 
  Amorim said that the Brazilian Constitution states that 
capital punishment will not be applied in the country except in 
case of a declared war. He said: "Brazilian legislation is in 
line with the highest principles of respect for human life and 
rights." 
  Amorim concluded his speech by lauding OAS Secretary General 
Baena Soares, noting that his performance "will leave an 
indelible mark on the history of this hemisphere in terms of his 
success in promoting democracy and human rights."

<F P=106> [By Maria Cortina] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 9 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Gabriel de 
Vega, director of the Colombian National Drug Directorate, today 
said international cooperation in the struggle against drug 
trafficking has been hindered by double standards in some 
drug-consuming countries. The official, who is attending the 
10th Conference of Ibero-American Justice Ministers that began 
yesterday in this resort city, accused the industrialized 
countries of lacking the political will to fight powerful drug 
cartels. 
  "The struggle against drug trafficking has not failed. The 
truth of the matter is that many countries have not even started 
waging the battle," the Colombian delegate said, adding, "in 
terms of the fight against drugs, many contributed their noses 
and pockets, and we contributed the dead." 
  In the late eighties the now decimated Medellin Cartel waged 
a war against the Colombian Government to protest the 
extradition of Colombians to the United States. This war 
resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 politicians, judges, 
civilians, and policemen. 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the director of the National 
Drug Directorate said: "Countries become sensitive to this 
matter when they experience the crude reality of this problem. 
Countries like Mexico, Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia have 
experienced this situation." 
  "This situation," the official added, "has led us to have a 
political will, at least a clearer and firmer political will." 
  After accusing the consuming countries of practicing "double 
standards" in the struggle against organized crime, De Vega 
said, "Many of them sell huge amounts of chemicals that are 
needed to produce drugs, while at the same time they are 
demanding stronger counternarcotics measures." 
  The justice minister's conference, which ends tomorrow, is 
reviewing ways to control money laundering and to strengthen 
cooperation in the areas of legislation and information exchange 
in the hope of speeding up the integration of the judicial 
systems of the region. 
  The Colombian official said he trusts that the conference 
will support the host country's proposals for measures to 
control money laundering and the signing of multilateral 
agreements for judicial assistance and the exchange of evidence 
among the nations of the hemisphere. De Vega recalled that the 
strong blows dealt to the drug cartel's financial network over 
the past two years in the United States and Europe were 
recommended by Colombia. 
  Ricardo Franco Guzman, Mexican deputy attorney general, on 
Wednesday said his government supports the Ibero-American 
efforts to jointly confront crime and the illegal traffic of 
drugs. Franco Guzman said Mexico is interested in attending 
international meetings designed to find efficient ways to help 
Ibero-American justice. 
  Interviewed at the inauguration of the conference in 
Cartagena de Indias, Franco Guzman said he believes the exchange 
of judicial experience and information among the countries of 
the region is good. He added that his country will soon sign an 
agreement for the exchange of prisoners with Colombia -- an 
agreement similar to the one it has with the United States and 
Panama.

  [Text] Belem, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Peru recommended today at the 
plenum of the 24th OAS General Assembly that a link be 
established between human rights, terrorism, and drug 
trafficking. 
  Alejandro Leon Pazos, the Peruvian permanent OAS 
representative, suggested that a new chapter of international 
provisions on human rights take into account the true intensity 
of the violence generated by terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  Leon stated that effective international measures of 
condemnation should be adopted, and the appropriate sanctions 
meted out to offenders, in order to eradicate terrorism and drug 
trafficking. 
  The Peruvian delegate today addressed the delegates from the 
34 OAS member states who are meeting this week in the Brazilian 
Amazonian city of Belem, in Para State. 
  Leon noted that the recent Vienna Conference on Human Rights 
regarded the various forms and manifestations of terrorist acts, 
methods, and practices, as well as the nefarious ties existing 
between terrorist agents and drug trafficking, as activities 
aimed at destroying human rights, fundamental freedoms, and 
democracy; and as activities that threaten the territorial 
integrity and security of all states. 
  Leon added: "The international community must urgently 
strengthen the indispensable cooperation measures aimed at both 
preventing and fighting terrorism." 
  He added that the OAS "must clearly condemn terrorism as a 
form of human rights violation that affects our peoples, and 
consequently it must act immediately and effectively to stop 
this criminal scourge, instead of limiting ourselves to watching 
the tragic consequences it brings to our nations." 
  The Peruvian Government is waging a war against Shining Path 
terrorist guerrillas and to this end has adopted the death 
penalty, thus violating an OAS convention.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] The U.S. policy aimed at tightening the blockade 
against Cuba has recently proved that it completely lacks 
support. A large segment of the international community does 
not care that in his so-called message to the Cubans, U.S. 
President Bill Clinton vowed he would continue the economic 
boycott of Cuba. 
  President Clinton and U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, 
who 
is known worldwide as the author of the law that bears his name 
and reinforces the blockade, are now more isolated than ever 
before. Torricelli, wrapped in the anti-Cuban aura he loves to 
cultivate, failed in his attempt to interfere in the internal 
affairs of Mexico, a country he visited recently. During his 
stay in Mexico, the U.S. congressman certainly hoped to foster 
one of his aggressive moves against Cuba. But the attempt 
proved futile, and this author of a bill demanding political 
reforms in Mexico faced the rejection of deputies, high-ranking 
officials, and the media. 
  Mexican citizens belonging to the Go for Cuba solidarity 
group protested Torricelli's visit in front of the U.S. Embassy 
in Mexico City, where they burned a coffin and an effigy of the 
congressman and his anti-Cuban law. 
  In Mexico City, delegates attending the 20th Conference of 
the Latin American Economic System [SELA] passed a resolution 
condemning the U.S. economic, trade, and financial blockade of 
Cuba, which has been in force for more than 30 years. The SELA 
document urged the lifting of all restrictions against Cuba -- 
the effects of which it described as detrimental to the 
population -- and it demanded the suspension of unilateral 
actions that are not in keeping with the current international 
economic and political environment. 
  While SELA was issuing this declaration, the Nonaligned 
Movement's 11th Foreign Ministers Conference demanded an end to 
the U.S. blockade of Cuba and asked Washington to stop 
committing acts contrary to the spirit of being a good neighbor. 
In addition, SELA asked for the return of Guantanamo Naval Base. 
  These governmental and popular rejections of U.S. harassment 
of Cuba echo two resolutions that were approved two years in a 
row by the UN General Assembly in 1992 and 1993. As of today, 
however, the U.S. Government has failed to heed the letter and 
spirit of these resolutions. The fact that the White House 
appears to be ignoring international pronouncements against the 
blockade does not detract from the importance or the value of 
these declarations. On the contrary, these actions are simply 
proof of the stubbornness of a nation that is ignoring a growing 
international trend.

  [Text] Barbados' sugar quota on the European market could 
be in jeopardy next year. Ann Drelo says this has nothing to do 
with management or a bad harvest. It does, however, have to do 
with the weather: 
  [Begin recording] [Drelo] The drought and brush fires have 
combined to put the island's number two industry in financial 
trouble. Agricultural officials point out that several acres of 
young cane plants have been destroyed. The damage is so severe 
that hopes of meeting the 54,000-tonne EC quota appear remote at 
this point. Already the organization responsible for managing 
the sugar industry -- the Barbados Agricultural Management 
Company [BAMC] -- is compiling data on the drought and the 
fires. It is hoping to use this data to show that any 
shortfalls are the result of an act of God. 
  [Unidentified speaker] I've been told by the management, the 
top management in BAMC, that they are going ahead with informing 
the European Union well ahead of next year's crop of the 
problems we've had with the drought to make absolutely sure that 
we are not unprepared when it comes to not being able to fill 
our quota, because this is a really serious issue. If we lose 
any of our 50,000-tonne quota and we make it even less, we are 
even less likely to survive in the future. So, it is absolutely 
important, it is absolutely essential, that we keep our quota 
with the European Union. 
  [Drelo] Chairman of the BAMC, Dr. Atley Bradford, says he is 
looking carefully at the situation and a request for a reprieve 
could go off to the EC in December. He says this would give 
them enough time to see if the crop has recovered. However, he 
says even if the rain falls heavily now, next year's crop won't 
reach the output of this year's. Dr. Bradford says the industry 
would not make a profit from this year's crop and the loss of 
the EC quota or a reprieve would spell doom for the industry.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Due to several 
violent incidents on the Haitian border, today, Dominican 
Republic authorities suspended the crossing of Haitians into the 
Dominican Republic to seek food and medicine. 
  Army sources told the international press that the crossing 
of Haitians to purchase food and medicine was suspended on 
Friday after small groups were allowed to cross early in the day. 
  The crossing of people carrying food and medicine into Haiti 
continues to be restricted on the border after a Dominican 
soldier, posted in Dajabon in northern Dominican Republic, had 
his rifles snatched away from him on Thursday, provincial 
governor Abilio Escoto explained. 
  Local authorities said that in similar incidents, Haitians 
hurled stones at soldiers who patrol the common border. None of 
the attacks have been repelled up to now. 
  The UN Security Council augmented the economic embargo 
against Haiti on 21 May to force the coupist military officers 
who overthrew Jean Bertrand Aristide in 1991 to abandon power. 
  The Dominican Republic shares with Haiti the Caribbean 
island 
of Hispaniola and the common border is patrolled by 
approximately 15,000 Dominican soldiers under the observation of 
a U.S. mission that analyzes local Army needs to comply with the 
UN mandate. President Joaquin Balaguer was against sanctions on 
Haiti, but he promised to comply with them. 
  On Thursday, the president announced that according to a 
list 
sent by the United Nations, the sale of food and medicine to 
Haitians is to be allowed.

  [Excerpts] Santa Fe, 9 Jun (NA) -- The national Constituent 
Assembly has approved the general terms of the internal 
regulations jointly proposed by the PJ [Justicialist Party] and 
the UCR [Radical Civic Union] guaranteeing the approval of the 
Nucleus of Basic Coincidences for reforming the Constitution 
that will be voted on as a single package. 
  The first key vote of the Assembly took place last night. 
Representatives of the blocs who signed the Olivos Pact obtained 
an important victory -- by 182 votes for and 68 against -- with 
the approval of the internal regulations. Article 129 of those 
regulations establish the vote on the 13 points included in 
Article 2 of Law 23409 declaring the necessity of and 
opportunity for the reform. 
  The Assembly immediately afterwards started to vote on the 
144 articles of the regulations one by one. The process will 
continue during today's session. 
  On 7 June, the Grand Front bloc announced it will withdraw 
temporarily from the premises during the voting on Article 129, 
while Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity] and 
provincial blocs will stay to vote against the article, even 
during the article by article voting process. 
  The regulations were approved following eight days of 
extensive debates, during which nearly 100 convention delegates 
from the 17 blocs, more than just debating juridical matters, 
indulged in a marathon of speeches on the legitimacy of the 
Olivos Pact. Next week the Assembly will begin discussing 
specific items. 
  The political debate reached a climax yesterday with the 
speeches of the main bloc leaders (Raul Alfonsin of the UCR, 
Augusto Alasino of the PJ, Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Grand 
Front, and Assembly President Eduardo Menem). 
  Senator Menem gave a heated defense of the Olivos Pact, 
which 
he characterized as "innovative," and assured the delegates that 
he feels "even prouder" of having been one of the sponsors of 
the agreement "between the popular political forces" than to be 
seated in the Assembly. 
  Former President Raul Alfonsin, using a tone clearly 
different from the climate of controversy involving the 
Assembly, preferred to dip into political philosophy to argue in 
favor of his bloc's position and uphold "Chacho" Alvarez and the 
Grand Front's "positive attitude," which "grants legitimacy" to 
the constitutional reform. 
  "Chacho" Alvarez spoke just before Alfonsin. He appealed to 
the majority of Justicialist and Radical delegates' "common 
sense" "to open up the package" and thus permit their 
participation in the process "without insulting our 
consciences." [passage omitted] 
  The Constituent Assembly will install the 10 commissions 
established in the set of regulations next week. Five of these 
commissions will be headed by the PJ, three by the UCR, one by 
the Grand Front, and one by Modin. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Valparaiso -- Commenting on his meeting with 
President Bill Clinton, which is scheduled for 28 June in 
Washington, President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle said it will be 
"very positive for Chile because it will be a working meeting." 
  President Frei thus responded to a journalist's question at 
the Valparaiso City Hall where he attended a meeting of regional 
officials and Regional Council members. He said: "President 
Clinton, his advisers, and I will meet for about one hour to 
discuss several issues. We will have lunch and participate in 
other activities." 
  Frei said: "This is a short trip during which we will hold a 
working meeting. I believe it is very positive for Chile 
because we will be able to discuss all issues pertaining to 
bilateral ties." 
  Frei noted that last March, when Foreign Minister Carlos 
Figueroa met with the U.S. assistant secretary [not further 
identified], "we explained our position regarding bilateral ties 
with the United States. We have a vast agenda on all issues of 
interest to our two countries. This meeting will help to expand 
on these issues." 
  Frei added: "For us and for Chile (this meeting) is an event 
of great satisfaction because we will be able to visualize our 
national agenda for the next few years and the summit summoned 
by President Clinton. We will be able to express our opinion, 
which to some extent means explaining our personal view of Chile 
and Latin America to the most powerful country on Earth. The 
fact that Chile and its president have been invited is 
extraordinarily positive. It speaks highly of Chile, of the 
political process, of the development our country has achieved 
at all levels -- at the economic, social and political level. 
We are very happy with this trip." 
  Asked if the agenda includes Chile's joining NAFTA, Frei 
said: "NAFTA is one of the subjects we will discuss. It is on 
the agenda."

  [Text] Mexico City, 12 Jun (AFP) -- On 12 June, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari ordered the National Defense 
Secretariat to maintain a "unilateral cease-fire" in the 
conflict in the southern State of Chiapas, where the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN] rejected official proposals to 
reach peace agreements. 
  A communique issued by the Presidency of the republic stated 
that Salinas ordered the Mexican Army to maintain the cease-fire 
and continue to patrol the country's southern border to prevent 
any gunrunning. 
  On 11 June, the EZLN, which staged an armed rebellion in 
January, rejected the government's offers and virtually broke 
off the negotiations by summoning a National Democratic 
Congress, whose goal, among others, is reportedly to establish a 
provisional government. 
  "Attentive to the indeclinable determination of the 
government of the republic to preserve peace and guarantee the 
economic and political development of the region, which is 
immersed in a conflict, the president ordered various 
institution to continue implementing programs and executing 
actions that were previously agreed upon," the document added. 
  Salinas also ordered Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
to continue efforts to find a political and negotiated solution 
to the conflict in Chiapas. The EZLN rejected government 
proposals but also decided to maintain a unilateral cease-fire 
and to continue seeking a solution to the "war" in Chiapas.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Mexican Zapatist National </F>
Liberation Army's, EZLN, Clandestine Indian Revolutionary 
Committee-General Command, CCRI-CG, in Chiapas on 3 June] 
  [Text] To the people of Mexico, the people and governments 
of the world, and brothers: 
  The EZLN's CCRI-CG addresses you to declare the following: 
  1) We have learned that persons who are active in the 
so-called organization Revolutionary Workers Clandestine 
People's Union party (PROCUP) have gone to someplace in the 
Americas to declare that PROCUP has ties with the EZLN and that 
the EZLN is PROCUP's "armed wing." These persons have been 
collecting funds, claiming that "they are for the EZLN." 
  2) The EZLN declares it has no relationship or any tie to 
PROCUP. The EZLN never has had any contact with PROCUP, it is 
not part of its structure, nor does it have anything to do with 
it. The economic contributions received by PROCUP are not in any 
way for the EZLN. 
  3) In several Chiapas municipalities, activists of the 
so-called Labor Party [PT] attempt to convince the peasants to 
vote for the PT in the coming August elections, arguing that it 
has contacts with the EZLN and that "there is an agreement with 
subcommander Marcos," to support the PL in August. 
  4) The EZLN declares that subcommander Marcos and members of 
the CCRI-CO have no relations nor any pact with the so-called 
PL, nor have they ever met with PL leaders. 
  5) We urge the different organizations not to make use of 
the EZLN's name to benefit their interests and not to lie with 
regard to their alleged relations, which they know that they do 
not have with us. 
  6) We call on the Mexican people and the peoples of the 
world not to be deceived. When the EZLN makes contacts or 
agreements with any organization, it makes this known in a 
public communique, as it has done with the CEOIC [State Council 
of Indian and Peasant Organizations] and with the CONAC-LN 
[expansion unknown]. 
  Democracy! Freedom! Justice! 
  Respectfully, the CCRI-CG. General headquarters, southeast 
Mexican mountains, Chiapas, Mexico, June 1994.

  [Text] San Salvador, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The defense of 
former rebel [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front -- FMLN] 
commander Joaquin Villalobos, charged with libel, today 
presented in court an alleged CIA document confirming the 
existence of death squads in El Salvador. 
  The documents, which were delivered Friday to the Eighth 
Penal Court, prove the links of Salvadoran businessman Orlando 
De Sola to the deaths squads, which were responsible for the 
death last decade of hundreds of civilians. 
  De Sola sued Villalobos in November for libel, after the 
former guerrilla assured the local press that the businessman 
financed these paramilitary groups. 
  "It is an official CIA text," Attorney Felix Ulloa told the 
press after delivering the document that makes up a package 
[words indistinct] that the U.S. Government "declassified" in 
November 1993. 
  Washington released the documents following the October 1993 
murders of former rebel commanders Francisco Velis, Heleno 
Castro, and two other high-ranking leaders of the current FMLN 
political party. 
  Ulloa has assured that the text states "that Orlando De Sola 
is linked with isolated groups of Salvadorans in Miami, Florida, 
which finance the death squads." 
  According to the Truth Commission -- in charge of 
investigating violations of human rights during the civil war 
that the country underwent for nearly 12 years -- these groups 
were financed by Salvadoran businessmen residing in Miami and 
backed by the [Salvadoran] state. 
  The defense attorney requested the court to verify with the 
U.S. Embassy in El Salvador the document's "authenticity." 
  "We believe that with what we have presented, Villalobos is 
exonerated of whatever penal responsibility in the libel case 
because this (the document) proves what he said," Ulloa said. 
  Rigoberto Chicas, secretary for the Eight Penal Court said 
that the evidence supplied by Villalobos will be "examined and 
appraised" by the authorities. 
  He announced that it is possible that the court may issue a 
resolution by the end of June or beginning of July.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 12 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Ramiro de 
Leon Carpio government today reported a plan to destabilize 
Guatemala through violent means, indicating that the plan seeks 
to delay the peace process, sow terror, and prevent the renewal 
of the National Parliament. 
  The Guatemalan president said that, if necessary, he will 
order the mobilization of Army troops to various areas of the 
country to contain "planned" disturbances and an alleged wave of 
violence that aims to undermine the country's institutions. On 
Friday, gang members attacked pedestrians, destroyed about 100 
vehicles and robbed various commercial establishments, without 
immediate reaction from the police. 
  "We will impose order with the law in our hand to guarantee 
security for the people," the president said after deploring the 
violent actions by vandals who took over the center of the 
capital. 
  Government Minister Danilo Parinello said the disturbances 
were financed by "a sector" to sow chaos and terror so as to 
prevent the country's pacification. Nevertheless, he did not 
name the sector to which he referred. Parinello said the 
violence unleashed in the city has the objective of preventing 
the replacement of 116 deputies, whose term ends in 1996, 
through legislative elections in August. "The wave of violence 
is manageable," the chief of Guatemalan security said. 
  Prosecutor General Ramses Cuestas urged Parinello to present 
a report on the disturbances and on those who sponsored them so 
the appropriate penalties can be applied. 
  National Police spokesman Gonzalo Figueroa Castellanos said 
he has information about a destabilization plan, but he declined 
to name those responsible for it. In this regard, the police 
spokesman confirmed that several dynamite charges were placed at 
an electricity pylon located on kilometer marker 18.5 of the 
highway between Guatemala City and San Pedro Ayampuc 
Municipality to the west. He said the explosive damaged the 
infrastructure, causing nearly $75,000 in damage. 
  Meanwhile, General Efrain Rios Montt, former de facto 
president (1982-1983), suggested to the De Leon Carpio 
government that "it apply a hard hand to rebuild the country, 
because it is pitiful to see the way it is today." Rios Montt, 
who is a candidate for deputy for the Guatemalan Republican 
Front, said the country "has been knocked about since the 
beginning of the decade when the law was undermined, but now 
strong measures must be taken to rescue the nation."

  [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino has stated that 
drugs and illegal drug trafficking are matters that concern both 
the United States and Panama. He added that it is a priority to 
hold a high-level meeting to coordinate joint actions. 
  [Begin Mulino recording] If the U.S. Government confirms it, 
we will hold a meeting at the highest level in Panama during the 
first week of July. I will preside over this meeting, and it is 
to be attended by very important U.S. State and Justice 
Department, perhaps even U.S. Treasury, officials to discuss all 
the drug trafficking and money laundering problems. 
  As you will recall, on 13 April I sent a letter to U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher telling him that, instead 
of talking and arguing whether we have cooperated or not, I 
invited him to a high-level meeting in Panama to discuss this 
topic. The invitation has been accepted and, hopefully, will be 
held during the first week of July. [end recording]

  [Text] Caracas, 10 Jun (DPA) -- Foreign Minister Miguel 
Angel Burelli Rivas said today Haitian refugees will not come to 
his country, and that topic "has only existed in the imagination 
of some." 
  The foreign minister acknowledged the U.S. Government had 
made a request to Venezuela to accept a group of refugees, but 
they will definitely not be received. "We have sufficient 
poverty and masses of uninvited immigrants here who are causing 
us problems, and we are not going to increase those problems 
with groups of foreigners," Burelli Rivas indicated. 
  Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom also commented on this 
matter, stating Venezuela cannot be tasked with resolving the 
problems of the peoples of other countries. The official added 
that "all the immigrants who want to cannot enter our country, 
only those who are part of a selective immigration program based 
on the national interest." 
  Opposing the arrival of refugees are political and social 
sectors, including the Senate Foreign Policy Committee. Through 
its chairwoman, Haydee Castillo, the Committee indicated on 
Tuesday that "the country does not have the economic and social 
conditions to receive those persons."

  [Text] Lima, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Peruvian press reports 
today that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
has finally decided to run for president. The press reports add 
that Perez de Cuellar hopes to officially announce his decision 
in August. 
  According to the newspaper EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar's 
decision was announced by a group of Peruvian politicians, 
businessmen, and personalities who met him a few days ago in 
Paris, where Perez de Cuellar currently lives. 
  The Peruvian presidential and legislative elections will be 
held in April 1995 but the deadline for the registration of 
presidential candidates is October 1994. 
  EXPRESO reports that the former UN secretary general hopes 
Police Inspector General Antonio Ketin, responsible for 
capturing Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman in 1992, and Diego 
Garcia Sayon, former Andean Lawyers Commission chairman and an 
old leftist militant, will be his running mates. 
  According to EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar has "declined" any 
eventual alliances with traditional political parties that 
support his candidacy. He believes their support will do him 
more harm than good because they will take away votes from him. 
  He has proposed, however, giving more participation in his 
eventual administration to the main party supporting him, the 
Popular Christian Party (PPC), if the main PPC leaders decide to 
withdraw their candidacies to the legislature. 
  Perez de Cuellar approved a list of candidates to the 
legislature encompassing independent politicians identified with 
the opposition, such as Maximo San Roman, who was President 
Alberto Fujimori's vice president until the 1992 coup d'etat. 
  The list also includes personalities such as former Senators 
Enrique Bernales (Socialist) and Raul Ferrero (conservative); 
Daniel Estrade, the leftist mayor of Cusco; and Bar Association 
President Jorge Avendano, among others. 
  Moreover, political circles have reported high-ranking 
Peruvian media representatives also were present in the Paris 
meeting at Perez de Cuellar's request. 
  The same sources reported that Alfredo Barnechea, a 
journalist and former candidate for Lima City Hall for the 
American Popular Revolutionary Alliance -- headed by former 
President Alan Garcia -- will be the 75-year-old veteran 
diplomat's campaign manager. Barnechea is married to Perez de 
Cuellar's stepdaughter. 
  Perez de Cuellar's campaign will be launched next week with 
several new members and the collection of signatures to support 
the former UN secretary general's candidacy.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Jun (AFP) -- The Peruvian Government 
extended the state of emergency for 60 days beginning today in 
several provinces of three Amazonian departments because 
"narcoterrorist actions continue" there, it was officially 
reported today. 
  Meanwhile, the police reported that on the evening of 10 
June 
two policemen and a private agent who were guarding stores -- 
the former two in the capital city district of El Agustino and 
the third in San Miguel -- were overpowered by presumed Shining 
Path commando units, who seized their weapons. The attackers 
made death threats against the three attack victims and threw 
leaflets referring to the "armed struggle" and expressing 
opposition to the government. 
  This special measure, which is contained in a supreme decree 
published by the EL PERUANO official gazette, affects the 
provinces of the jungle departments of Huanuco, San Martin, and 
Loreto. The provision implies the suspension of constitutional 
guarantees in the areas mentioned and also means that the Armed 
Forces will continue to guarantee public order. 
  Official figures indicate that more than 60 percent of 
national territory falls under this regime and that the 
constitutional guarantees of nearly 50 percent of the Peruvian 
population (22,128,466 inhabitants) have been restricted since 
the start of the "fratricidal war" in 1980 in Ayacucho, in the 
southeastern Andean region, which has claimed more than 27,000 
lives.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with former Minister of Economy Juan </F>
Carlos Hurtado Miller; place and date not given: "Hurtado 
Proposes Putting All CPT Privatization Revenues Into 
Agriculture;" first paragraph is EL COMERCIO introduction] 
  [Text] A new "agrarian reform" so the campesinos will no 
longer just be producers, but will instead become businessmen, 
with full financing to come from the over $2 billion generated 
by the privatization of the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] was 
proposed yesterday by Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller, former 
Minister of Agriculture (during the government of Fernando 
Belaunde) and former chairman of the Council of Ministers and 
Minister of Economy and Finance (during the present government). 
A former Popular Action activist, Hurtado Miller (born in Lima 
in 1940) graduated from the National Agrarian University in 
1962, a year after the present head of state, Alberto Fujimori. 
In an interview with EL COMERCIO, he said it is now time for 
agriculture to emerge from the prostration in which it has been 
sunk for the past 20 years. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Why should agriculture be the priority sector 
to get the $2 billion from privatizing the Peruvian Telephone 
Company? 
  [Hurtado] For economic development reasons. This sector can 
give the fastest response with a little investment. We can 
improve our food supply and diversify our exports. We would also 
be able to stabilize our food growth, improve our price 
structure, and create greater territorial integration. On the 
social side, it is urgent to attack critical poverty and improve 
the occupation of Peru's territory. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Why has agriculture been the sector least 
favored by the state in recent times? 
  [Hurtado] There are spectacular figures that destroy the 
economy. From 1980 to 1984 agricultural subsidies declined 
systematically. That trend was reversed in 1985; agricultural 
subsidies soared and came to $944 million in 1988. In 1989 these 
subsidies were $2.64 billion. And subsidizing a sector in such a 
total, massive, and generic manner as was done in agriculture by 
the former government does not help that sector. Those subsidies 
favor consumers and undermine the real growth of agriculture. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Are you suggesting there should be no 
subsidies 
for agriculture? 
  [Hurtado] The subsidy system has to exist, but it needs to 
be 
guided, focused, and financed with real resources -- it also 
must be temporary. There cannot be an indiscriminate expansion 
of subsidies via the Central Reserve Bank. This government (the 
Fujimori administration) deactivated the Agrarian Bank because 
it thought the Agrarian Bank was causing inflation. That is not 
true. What creates inflation is (inorganic) issues by the 
Central Bank. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Do you think the time has come to promote 
agro-industry with the resources generated by privatization? 
  [Hurtado] This is a great opportunity for Peru. People say 
we 
are going to get $6 billion through privatization. The agrarian 
sector represents 30 percent of the country's population. So it 
should get 30 percent of the resources from privatization: $2 
billion. I propose that all the revenues from privatizing the 
CPT be allocated to the agrarian sector. We need to develop two 
types of agro-industry: high-tech for export purposes and 
intermediate-level technology. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Then we would not need to rely on external 
sources to finance agricultural development? What the now 
flourishing Public Treasury can provide for us is more than 
sufficient? 
  [Hurtado] These resources from privatization ($2 billion) 
can 
generate nearly $1 billion in credit, either from multinational 
organizations, from development banks, or bilateral loans from 
other countries. In the next three or four years we could get $3 
billion. That would create a great boost for the agrarian 
sector, which provides 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. 
<H5>  The Proposal </H5>
  [EL COMERCIO] Tell us about your proposal for using the 
resources from the CPT's privatization. 
  [Hurtado] On a national level we need to make up the deficit 
in the National Food Reserve by allocating $50 million for 
production areas. We need to establish a production and market 
information system and a Promotion Fund to create agricultural 
and seed production services with private industry to ensure 
vertical growth in agriculture. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What needs to be done to revitalize 
agricultural exports? 
  [Hurtado] We propose to create a fund to promote exportable 
crops and export guarantees, starting by targeting specific 
zones for production and promoting social development. The 
BLADEX [Latin American Export Promotion Bank] and FLAR [Latin 
American Reserve Fund] can provide us with $100 million. We are 
also proposing agricultural credit insurance to cover natural 
disasters. 
  [EL COMERCIO] But agriculture also needs technological 
support.... 
  [Hurtado] Our proposal contains a technical assistance 
program, to complement credit, and two programs: one for the 
creation of high-tech agroindustry and the second for primary 
processing with intermediate-level technology. These proposals 
total $520 million, with the resources to come from 
privatization. And we are also considering another $350 million 
in additional funding that could be financed by international 
development banks or by bilateral credits. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Your proposal, divided by regions (coast, 
mountains, and forests), comes to $1.6 billion. For the coast 
you propose establishing a loan guarantee fund. What would that 
involve? 
  [Hurtado] Commercial banks do not make agricultural loans, 
and they are not going to. They say this is a problem of land 
ownership titles. Only 54 percent of our cultivated land area 
has ownership titles. The Loan Guarantee Fund could have $50 
million in cash so that Peruvian banks will earmark $1 billion 
for agrarian credit. I will also mention midterm financing for 
advanced irrigation systems for 100,000 hectares at a cost of 
$200 million. We also need a saline land recovery program 
because 30 percent of the total of $600 million is for the coast. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What about resources to stimulate agrarian 
production in the mountains, which have recently experienced 
population declines, and the forests, where coca plantations now 
occupy our arable land? 
  [Hurtado] For the mountains we are proposing another $600 
for 
three projects: the South American llama and related species 
breeding project, the rural development program, and 
communications infrastructure. For the forests we suggest two 
programs: a coca crop replacement program with a guaranteed 
price, so the state will start to buy from the forests to create 
incentives by promoting other crops like rice or corn. The other 
program is the improvement of our road system. Right now it is 
cheaper to import rice from South Vietnam or the Philippines 
than to get it from Huallaga. That would be the $2 billion 
agrarian development program. So in the future campesinos will 
not get used to living on subsidies or gifts, paternalism, or 
simply on state aid. Instead, the role of private activity will 
be preponderant, it will be the driving force. In summary, 
producers will become businessmen with the determined support of 
commercial banks and with the state providing resources.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) -- 
High-ranking Cuban officials, who are participating in the 
meetings prior to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, doubt that 
other presidents will ask Fidel Castro to make political 
changes, "because we have not come with an agenda to ask 
anything from anybody." 
  "Cuba respects the self-determination of every country, and 
it, therefore, demands that ours be respected as well," Cuban 
Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos, who has participated in 
the drafting of the final document of the summit, told EFE. 
Diplomatic sources, however, said some presidents, including 
the Spanish prime minister, talked to the Cuban leader about the 
need to accelerate the economic reforms and to introduce 
political changes as he had done on previous occasions. The 
same sources said that, during the meetings prior to the summit, 
the Cuban delegation, which customarily attracts the most 
attention, "was not belligerent or demanding at all." 
  Bolanos confirmed that the final document makes a direct 
reference to the economic embargo imposed by the United States 
on Cuba over 30 years ago. "I would have preferred to say that 
the blockade is an illegal and unfair act, but when the meeting 
is held in a framework where an agenda has to be discussed, you 
have to bear these factors in mind." 
  In fact, as occurred last year during the Third 
Ibero-American Summit held in Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, neither 
Cuba nor the United States are mentioned in the final document. 
The term embargo is not used, let alone the term blockade. 
  The draft of the final document, which must be approved by 
the foreign ministers today and subsequently by the heads of 
state, "reiterates the firm rejection of any measure that 
adversely affects the free development of trade, violates the 
principles of international law, and hurts the living conditions 
of the Latin American peoples." 
  The Cuban deputy foreign minister also recognized that the 
text of the document, the contents of which are essentially 
economic in nature, is a confirmation of liberal principles, 
"with certain amendments that balance it out." 
  "The opinion of Cuba," he said, "is that any document must 
take into account the 400 million Latin Americans, especially 
the 200 million who live in conditions of extreme poverty, and 
must therefore emphasize social policies." 
  For the Cuban Government, this Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
will be a success "if the heads of state categorically speak out 
in favor of the creation of Latin American economic and trade 
opportunities that can insert Latin America into an 
international and world context," Bolanos said. 
  Presently, Cuba is not involved in any integration mechanism 
in progress, but it believes it is "very encouraging" to see 
the signing this afternoon of the free trade agreement between 
Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico with possibilities of its being 
opened up to the Caribbean and Central American countries. 
Bolanos also noted that the Association of Caribbean States is 
currently being formed and that it includes the islands and the 
continental countries bordering the Caribbean. "Cuba has been 
there since the beginning," he said. 
  The deputy foreign minister said that during the preparatory 
meetings no delegate spoke about the hemispheric summit convened 
by U.S. President Bill Clinton, "from which we have not excluded 
ourselves but from which we have been excluded." "We neither 
like it nor dislike it, and we are not going to ask for an 
invitation," said the Cuban deputy foreign minister, who added 
that he is convinced that Clinton's initiative will not 
undermine the Ibero-American summit. In this regard, he pointed 
out that a timetable has already been drafted for the next 
summits, and, if approved by the heads of state or governments, 
they will be held in Argentina (1995), Chile (1996), Venezuela 
(1997), Portugal (1998), Cuba (1999), and Panama (2000).

<F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Fabio Callejas from </F>
Cartagena de Indias; from the "Caracol's Quarter Hour" newscast; 
passages within quotation marks are recorded -- live] 
  [Text] At this time, the tarmac of the Rafael Nunez Airport 
in Cartagena is completely full of aircraft. As the central 
studios have reported, the Spanish royal couple, King Carlos and 
Queen Sofia, arrived from Madrid aboard a Spanish Air Force 
flight at 1535 [2035 GMT] and at 1555 Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez arrived. At 1615 [2115 GMT] Peruvian President Alberto 
Fujimori arrived. Later, arriving from San Jose, Costa Rica, 
were Costa Rican President Jose Figueres, Salvadoran President 
Armando Calderon Sol, Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon 
Carpio, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro, Panamanian President Guillermo 
Endara, and Brazilian President Itamar Franco, all aboard the 
same Colombian Air Force [FAC] Fokker airplane. Costa Rican 
President Jose Maria Figueres, who was one of the first to 
emerge from the FAC aircraft, said: 
  [Figueres] "We are all pleased to be here. May my first 
words be of solidarity with the Colombian people for last week's 
tragedy." 
  Humanitarian economic development and consolidation of the 
Central American peace process are the main issues the 
presidents of these countries have outlined, upon arriving just 
moments ago at the Rafael Nunez International Airport. 
Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro also greets the Colombian 
people on Radio Caracol. 
  [Chamorro] "Good afternoon, dear friends of Cartagena de 
Indias, dear journalists, and all those listening. This is 
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the president of Nicaragua." 
  The leaders who arrived aboard the special FAC flight also 
expressed their feelings of sympathy for the Colombian people, 
following the catastrophe in Huila and Cauca Departments. 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol also offers his 
greetings: 
  [Calderon Sol] "As president of El Salvador, it is a real 
pleasure to be in this generous nation, Colombia, which opens 
its arms to welcome all of the Ibero-American leaders. We all 
believe such summit meetings are very beneficial for our people." 
  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina briefly addressed 
the 
Colombian people. 
  [Reina] "I offer a fraternal salute to the Colombian people 
and express my sympathy for the trying moments you are 
experiencing." 
  The Group of Three [G-3] nations will sign the G-3 trade 
agreement at 1930 at the guest house for illustrious visitors, 
here in Cartagena de Indias.

  [Text] The heads of state and government participating in 
the fourth Latin American summit are taking advantage of their 
meeting in Cartagena de Indias to hold bilateral meetings. 
Cuban President Fidel Castro has expressed his interest in 
meeting with Felipe Gonzalez. Juan Luis Diaz Prats reports from 
Colombia: 
  [Diaz Prats] King Juan Carlos and Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez have held separate meetings with other leaders 
attending the fourth Latin American summit. The king received 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto 
Lacalle, and Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres. King 
Juan Carlos was interested in the situation in Chile and Costa 
Rica and in Central America. He said he regretted having to 
delay until next year his official visit to Uruguay, a country 
which has begun the electoral process. 
  Gonzalez held meetings with the presidents of Colombia, 
Uruguay, and Honduras. The summit agenda was discussed during 
these meetings, but so was the situation in Cuba. Cuban 
President Castro has asked to speak to Gonzalez at 0700 Colombia 
time, which is 1400 Spanish time. Castro was the last leader to 
arrive in Cartagena, after 2300 local time. 
  The Uruguayan president confirmed to Gonzalez that his 
government would continue to collaborate in the fight against 
terrorism, restricted only by respect for judicial decisions. 
Gonzalez also spoke about cooperation with the three Latin 
American leaders. In the specific case of Colombia, the Spanish 
prime minister offered to continue aid to the areas devastated 
by the floods in Cauca and Huila, which will be visited at the 
end of the summit by Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for 
international cooperation and Latin America, who is responsible 
for drawing up a Spanish aid plan for southwest Colombia.

<F P=106> [Report by Pedro Palomo and Orlando Cano from </F>
Cartagena--live] 
  [Text] Mexican President Carlos Salinas, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera 
are now signing the free trade agreement of the three nations, 
collectively known as the Group of Three [G-3]. Caracol asked 
President Salinas about the future of the trade alliance and the 
eradication of poverty through regional trade exchanges: 
  [Begin recording] [Salinas] We in Mexico are convinced the 
only way to defeat poverty [words indistinct] economic growth, 
because without well-paying jobs there will be no chance of 
permanently eradicating poverty. Simultaneously [words 
indistinct] accelerated growth recovery there must be a 
deliberate social program. [end recording] 
  There is a warm breeze at 2008 here at the Guest House. 
President Gaviria is replying to the questions of local and 
foreign journalists, approximately 100 of them, who were 
accredited to cover the signing of the much-awaited G-3 
agreement, which will allow Colombia, among other things, [word 
indistinct] an additional $400 million beginning 1 January 1995. 
  Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Caldera said the signing of 
the G-3 agreement could help Venezuela overcome the economic 
problems caused by a crisis in the exchange rate. The president 
said these kinds of agreements are reached primarily to 
consolidate the [two-second break in reception] and development 
of each country. 
  This is a mechanism to fight poverty, the plight of the 
unprotected, insecurity, and terrorism, because if there are 
more businesses and more exchanges, there will be more jobs for 
the unemployed, and as a result, the peoples of Latin America 
will be able to enter the path of peace.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) -- The 
presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela here on Monday 
signed the free trade agreement of the Group of Three (G-3), 
which calls for a gradual elimination of tariffs among these 
nations within 10 years. 
  The agreement was signed by Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas, 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Colombian President 
Cesar Gaviria. They will participate, beginning on Tuesday, in 
the Fourth Ibero-American summit of chiefs of state and 
government in this city in northwestern Colombia. 
  The treaty, which was signed at the Presidential Home for 
Illustrious Guests, will benefit 150 million inhabitants of 
these three countries, and in initial stages, will generate 
business amounting to $600 million per year. Its signing was 
achieved after more than three years of efforts that nearly 
failed in May. 
  The G-3 agreement will go into effect in early 1995, and for 
Colombia and Venezuela it offers an opportunity to request 
membership in NAFTA, of which Mexico is a signatory as well as 
the United States and Canada.

  [Text] San Jose, 13 Jun (AFP) -- The Central American 
presidents agreed to propose at the Cartagena summit an 
endorsement of Ibero-American ecological and trade integration 
and to request specific actions to promote the isthmus' 
"unrestricted" access to third markets. 
  After a second working session that concluded today at noon, 
the Central American presidents signed in San Jose a joint 
declaration outlining proposals for the area with the 
Ibero-American summit in mind. This summit will open in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on Tuesday. 
  "We propose that Ibero-America incorporate ecological 
integration into efforts toward economic and social integration. 
It is necessary to combine subregional integration agreements 
so it will be possible in the near future to create a large free 
trade zone," states the document, which was read by Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio . 
  De Leon emphasized the need for the Ibero-American community 
to increase technical and financial aid to Central America to 
fight poverty; promote fair, sustainable development; and 
consolidate its democratic process after enduring the previous 
decade's severe crisis aggravated by the "Cold War." 
  The document states: "Renewed international solidarity with 
Central America should be expressed in concrete actions in the 
field of trade exchange, thus clearing the way for unrestricted 
access of the isthmus' products to the Ibero-American 
community's markets." 
  According to the presidents, ecological integration will 
allow the establishment of Ibero-American environmental laws, 
the signing and implementation of an agreement in favor of 
nature, and the transfer of technology to benefit all productive 
sectors. 
  The Central American presidents also agreed to request the 
participation of the Ibero-American nations as extraregional 
associates of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration 
to finance regional development projects. 
  The declaration was signed by Presidents De Leon Carpio, 
Carlos Roberto Reina (Honduras), Armando Calderon Sol (El 
Salvador), Violeta Chamorro (Nicaragua), Guillermo Endara 
(Panama), and Jose Maria Figueres (Costa Rica). 
  The Costa Rican president stressed that despite internal 
differences Central American countries must face the 
"challenges" of development together as an example of the 
isthmus nations' "brotherhood." 
  In addition, the presidents called for a Central American 
ecological summit to be held in Nicaragua 12-13 October as well 
as for an international conference for peace and development in 
Central America, slated for 24-25 June in Honduras. 
  After the mini summit, the first working session of which 
was 
held on Sunday night, the Central American presidents will 
travel to Cartagena together in a plane provided by the 
Colombian Government.

  [Text] San Jose, 13 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central American 
presidents today demanded a solution to the Cuban situation 
within the framework of the inter-American system, but ruled out 
taking this issue before the fourth Ibero-American summit, which 
will be held in Colombia tomorrow and Wednesday, or that it will 
be the subject of an agreement. 
  At the conclusion of a two-day meeting in Costa Rica, 
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina said that this is a 
regional stand, although there may be details that they might 
not agree on. Reina said that Central America would like to see 
a "democratic transition" in Cuba, but attributed the 
responsibility of seeking a solution to the OAS. "It is a 
problem of the (inter-American) system, and we must find a 
solution to this special case," Reina pointed out when consulted 
on this issue, which was not included in the final document of 
the Central American meeting. 
  The Honduran president and Costa Rican President Jose Maria 
Figueres agreed, however, that the solution of the Cuban problem 
"must come from within the Cuban family." Figueres said that 
now that the bipolar world is a thing of the past and the Cold 
War is over "we have an obligation to assess" our foreign 
relations, among others, with Cuba, a country with which Costa 
Rica broke relations in the 1960's, as did most of the Latin 
American countries. "In these new times we want to be sure of 
what we are doing," the chief of state said. He added that all 
efforts must be made to ensure that Cuba will be able to move 
forward "in a peaceful manner." 
  The chiefs of state, however, refused to say whether they 
want to reestablish relations with Cuba, request an end to the 
economic blockade imposed by the United States for more than 30 
years, or call for Cuba's reinstatement into the OAS, from which 
it was expelled in the 1960's. 
  A diplomatic source that requested anonymity, however, said 
that the Cuban case could bring a surprise at the Ibero-American 
summit, which will take place tomorrow and Wednesday in 
Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), but refused to elaborate.

<F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro Cuevas from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met privately 
with Fidel Castro, president of the Cuban Councils of State and 
Ministers. Cuban President Fidel Castro accompanied the Mexican 
president to the Protocol House of the Cuban Government where 
Salinas rested a few minutes before beginning his meeting with 
his host. Prior to this, at the Jose Marti International 
Airport, Salinas reviewed a Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces 
honor guard. 
  Salinas also did something unexpected. He walked to where a 
group of people were standing behind the security line and 
personally greeted them. The Cuban and Mexican national anthems 
were played during the official welcome ceremony at the airport. 
Salinas stood with his arms down while President Castro saluted 
with his right hand. 
  The presidents left the airport in a limousine adorned with 
the Cuban flag on the right side and the Mexican flag on the 
left. The limousine drove down the main runway from where a 
huge placard with Salinas' face could be seen as well as other 
placards reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples 
of Cuba and Mexico, and Welcome, President Salinas de Gortari. 
  All along the route to the Protocol House were placards 
reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of Marti 
and Juarez, and Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship between 
Mexico and Cuba. Cuban radio stations carried live coverage of 
the Mexican president's arrival in Cuba and his arrival at the 
Cuban Government House. Here, the two presidents met privately. 
At the end of the meeting, Castro hosted a lunch for the 
Mexican president. After lunch, the two presidents met again to 
discuss the many topics on the bilateral agenda. 
  According to statements by Castro during an interview, the 
most important subject discussed was attracting Mexican capital 
to Cuba. While at the Protocol House, Castro told the press his 
country's foremost relations with the hemisphere are precisely 
with Mexico. 
  During the meeting with the Mexican press, Castro also 
talked 
about the situation in Chiapas, the blockade Cuba is 
experiencing, the recent incidents in Mexico, and his life. 
Castro said the incidents that have occurred in Mexico saddened 
and pained him. 
  [Begin recording] [Navarro Cuevas] I have seen with concern 
and pain the problems Mexico has experienced, Fidel Castro, 
president of the Councils of State and Ministers, said. 
Interviewed shortly before the arrival of Mexican President 
Salinas, Castro said he would not be a realist if he were to say 
all is rose-colored in Mexico, especially in light of the 
situation it is experiencing. The Cuban leader explained, 
however, Mexico is not an isolated case; he said similar things 
are happening in other countries as a result of the lost decade 
[decada perdida]. Regarding Chiapas State, Castro said: 
  [Castro] You have asked me a very difficult question. Why? 
Because it is a question that concerns Mexican domestic affairs, 
and I am not the one to analyze those things. I do believe, 
however, [words indistinct] social problems and conflicts, but 
the situation is not only a Mexican situation; it is a situation 
that affects the whole hemisphere. [Words indistinct] the 
famous lost decade [words indistinct] problems. For example, 
[words indistinct] per capita is the same as 16 years ago. 
[Words indistinct] many social and economic problems that have 
accumulated. I would say those are factors that cause an [word 
indistinct] imbalance and create problems as the ones we see in 
Chiapas. 
  [Navarro Cuevas] Regarding the U.S. economic blockade 
against 
Cuba, a blockade that has lasted more than 30 years, Castro said 
it is the oldest blockade in history and it has been confronted 
by the longest resistance. He said investments are slowly 
returning to Cuba and are being consolidated on the island. 
Castro said if he were born again, he would do the same all over 
again, only better. Castro also said he would love to live more 
than 100 years. When asked if he hoped to do more in his life, 
Castro said he has been commander for more than 30 years. He 
said this title was given to him in Mexico. 
  In conclusion, the president of the Councils of State and 
Ministers said he is not a neoliberal and he would not talk 
about that because some of the countries that will attend the 
fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 
would not like it, and those countries are his friends. [end

  [Text] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, during 
a news conference in Havana, has reaffirmed his opposition to 
the U.S. blockade against Cuba, a country toward which he will 
always promote solidarity and respect. 
  Shortly before concluding his brief visit to the Cuban 
capital, Salinas de Gortari told the local and foreign media 
that, in his talks with his counterpart Fidel Castro, he 
discussed political and economic issues, including trade and 
investments by private Mexican citizens in the island. 
  In this regard, he confirmed an important investment by a 
Mexican company in the Cuban telephone industry as well as the 
preference that will be granted to the import of Cuban products 
such as textile products, tiles, and prefabricated houses. 
  As for the Fourth Ibero-American summit that will start on 
Tuesday, the Mexican president said he will attend it convinced 
that specific results will be achieved in the areas of trade and 
integration. He added that summits have shown their value as 
formidable political forums to collectively discuss issues that 
are common to all peoples of the region.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today in Havana, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari confirmed that private 
Mexican investors will make a "major investment" in Cuba's 
telecommunications industry. 
  President Salinas de Gortari noted that one of the most 
significant results of the official visit to Cuba was the 
confirmation of a telephone project. Salinas made the 
announcement during a news conference following a meeting with 
President Fidel Castro, within the agenda drawn up for his short 
stay in the Cuban capital. 
  On Monday, Domos Internacional, a private Mexican 
consortium, 
and the Cuban Ministry of Communications signed a "general 
agreement" to pave the way for a $1.5 billion investment to 
modernize the Cuban telephone system. The final details of the 
plan have yet to be established. 
  General Silvano Colas Sanchez, the Cuban minister of 
communications, disclosed that it calls for the creation of a 
partnership in which the Cuban State will own 51 percent of the 
company's shares and Mexican investors will control 49 percent. 
The investment will be made in two parts and part of the 
Mexican portion will be in the form of a trade-off of Cuba's 
debt, also known as swaps. This project could very well 
represent the single largest foreign investment project in Cuba. 
Its main goal is to modernize and expand the Caribbean island 
nation's current telephone network and provide all other related 
services. 
  President Salinas de Gortari said that during his interview 
with Castro, he discussed other Mexican private sector plans for 
investing in the textile and glass industries. Salinas de 
Gortari spent six hours in Cuba and then flew on to the 
Colombian port city of Cartagena de Indias, where he was 
scheduled to sign a free trade agreement with the Group of Three 
[G-3]. The Mexican president will sign the agreement with 
Presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Rafael Caldera of 
Venezuela, the other two nations that make up the G-3. The 
leaders expect the agreement to enter into effect on 1 January 
1995.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari said here today that a political solution has 
prevailed in the conflict in the southeastern State of Chiapas 
as part of a "new phase to achieve progress" in the search for 
solutions for that zone. Maintaining a cease-fire that is 
recognized by the Zapatist National Liberation Army and the 
prevalence of a political solution are elements that 
characterize the correct position assumed by the government 
toward the conflict, the president added. 
  During a news conference that he offered after talks with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro, Salinas de Gortari said his 
government will try to consolidate peace in and guarantee 
national sovereignty over that territory. He will also 
reinforce social programs already under way in that zone, 
especially those relating to health and supplies implemented as 
part of the official policy, about which the Mexican Government 
will offer more details later. 
  Salinas de Gortari added that besides those measures, the 
political parties and society are participating in the debate 
and efforts to achieve a consensus in the "country's political 
and democratic progress." "We have already achieved a national 
consensus in favor of peace," with regard to the situation in 
the extreme southeastern area of Mexico, the president added. 
  Salinas de Gortari said he discussed with Castro the 
situation in Chiapas, where an armed group occupied several 
towns on the first day of this year, followed by a unilateral 
cease-fire on the part of the government, and official peace 
talks. A government peace proposal was rejected this week by 
the armed group that, nevertheless, agreed to respect the 
cease-fire. The armed group's reply "seems to be more 
politically motivated than moved by social and justice 
considerations," he added. 
  "Although there are no formal peace agreements, the 
cease-fire is being maintained and a political solution 
prevails," Salinas de Gortari said. "These two results alone 
confirm that the strategy followed from the very beginning of 
the conflict was the correct one," the president pointed out. 
  He also recalled that the government is implementing 
projects 
to solve social and economic problems in Chiapas, where there is 
"important progress." Salinas de Gortari added that the work of 
Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and mediator Samuel Ruiz 
-- a Catholic bishop -- led to the establishment of talks with 
the armed group and the consolidation of the cease-fire. 
  President Salinas de Gortari visited Cuba for about six 
hours 
to meet with Castro before leaving for Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American summit.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- An official Mexican 
source reported Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
concluded an official visit to Cuba today after spotlighting 
with Cuban President Fidel Castro "the close and deep ties" that 
link the two countries. 
  "The main objectives were achieved," Mexican Ambassador 
Carlos Tello Macias told NOTIMEX this Monday, shortly after the 
Mexican Air Force airplane carrying Salinas to the fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Colombia took off. 
  Castro saw off the Mexican president at the foot of the 
stairs of the presidential plane, which left at 1720 (2120 GMT) 
after a brief drizzle. Salinas raised his arms from the top of 
the stairs to say goodbye to the high-ranking officials who saw 
him off at the Jose Marti Airport. 
  "Two sister peoples underscored their friendship and their 
deep and close relations," Tello said regarding the less than 
six-hour stay by the fourth Mexican president to visit Cuba 
since 1975. 
  "The two presidents discussed various topics of common 
interest and addressed broader aspects of international affairs. 
In addition to the talks, the visit achieved concrete results," 
the diplomat added. Tello said Mexico and Cuba achieved 
progress in the project for joint investments and joint 
enterprises (such as the agreement on telecommunications), 
adding "all of this always helps to strengthen bilateral ties." 
  Despite the brevity of the visit, Salinas carried out the 
scheduled agenda, which included an official lunch with Castro, 
talks between the two statesmen, a news conference, and a 
reception at the Mexican Embassy in Havana. Most of his visit 
centered on talks with President Castro, with whom he discussed 
the broad range of bilateral relations in the political, 
economic, trade, cultural, and scientific-technical cooperation 
fields.

<F P=106> [Report by special envoy Pedro Manuel Otero from Cartagena </F>
de Indias, Colombia for the "Evening Information Review" 
newscast] 
  [Text] Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos told Cuban 
media in this city that unlike previous summits, the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit to be held this coming Tuesday and 
Wednesday has specific objectives. 
  Bolanos described the summit called by the United States in 
December as a quasi-hemispheric meeting. Without Cuba, he said, 
the meeting will not be a meeting of all American countries. 
  Bolanos also said Cuba will ask to the host the 1999 summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Bolanos] This summit is taking place in a 
different international environment; for example, regional 
integration efforts are stronger at this fourth summit than at 
previous ones. On the eve of this summit, the Group of Three 
will sign a free trade treaty. The Association of Caribbean 
States has emerged as we approach the summit, and while it is 
true that the purpose of this association is not to promote 
integration, it aspires to promote agreements, cooperation, and 
trade and therefore contributes to integration. 
  This summit overshadows the so-called hemispheric summit, 
which I prefer to describe as quasi-hemispheric because a small 
part of the hemisphere will not be represented. 
  The region's heads of state will meet to design what the 
North Americans call a Latin American [words indistinct] policy, 
which we cannot [words indistinct] in Latin America, a policy 
that is obviously trying to lay the groundwork for a new version 
of the policy the United States set for Cuba and Latin America 
in the 1970's with the Alliance for Progress and Cuba's 
expulsion from the OAS and to take a firmer grip on the Latin 
American market to check growing competition from Japan and the 
European Community. 
  That is the context for the Cartagena summit, and that is 
why 
it will be different from the first, second, and third summits. 
We always attend summits with the purpose of obtaining specific 
results based on what we think is best for the region. We want 
results that foster integration, cooperation, and everything 
that contributes to the progress in the region and to a 
reaffirmation of regional identity. As a great Cuban 
intellectual used to say, by reaffirming our identity, we also 
define our differences from those who are not like us. 
  [Otero] Does Cuba expect any support or declaration by the 
presidents against the U.S. economic blockade? 
  [Botellos] [Words indistinct] a delayed resolution. I do not 
think this summit will do less than that. I think we will make 
progress because the world is different and there have been 
events with contribute to the issuance of a resolution more 
advanced than that issued in Bahia last year. 
  Observers and political experts analyzing this summit agree 
that the Bahia summit revived the principles established in 
Guadalajara and projected them in a very Latin American 
dimension, especially the development aspect, which is what 
hurts our region. Our region's main problems are the results of 
underdevelopment. The Bahia summit promoted discussion of this 
issue with the well defined intention of encouraging development 
not just for its own sake but for social progress. I think this 
was [words indistinct] the organizers of this summit. Any 
intention to [words indistinct]. 
  [Otero] You referred to the hemispheric summit as a 
quasi-hemispheric summit. Many believe this summit was convoked 
by the United States simply to interfere with the Ibero-American 
summit. Do you agree or do you think it is the result of a 
strategic policy by the U.S. Government? 
  [Bolanos] I do not think the United States has ever liked 
the 
Ibero-American summit. From the time the United States became a 
country, it has grown accustomed to influencing Latin America. 
I do not know if convoking that summit is the result of a 
policy, a doctrine, or of a need to prevail. [Words indistinct] 
have always existed to influence and dominate Latin America. 
  The Ibero-American Summit is a different project, an 
Ibero-American project that has a cultural basis, historical 
roots, and common problems, a project that includes Europeans 
who are not the most developed of that continent. There is a 
feeling of equilibrium that would not exist if the North 
Americans participated. 
  I think the quasi-hemispheric summit is a call to a meeting 
that has [word indistinct] intentions, the same intentions and 
ideas that motivated the founders of the Ibero-American summit, 
but the fact that Cuba is excluded highlights the difference 
between the spirit of that call and the spirit of the 
Ibero-American summits. That summit is intended to establish a 
policy that is not responsive to Latin America's needs, that 
includes discrimination against Cuba, and that forces Latin 
America to a sad dichotomy: going along with the principles set 
by the United States with a revision of its 1970's policies and 
turning their back on the Latin American people. 
  [Otero] Thank you very much. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Justice Minister Carlos Amat by </F>
correspondent Pedro Manuel Otero at the Hilton Hotel in 
Cartagena de Indias; date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Otero] We are here at the Hilton Hotel, which is 
the seat of the 10th conference of justice ministers. We will 
take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor 
Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we 
would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed 
and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban 
delegation? 
  [Amat] The meeting of Ibero-American justice ministers is a 
conference that has been held for several years. As you stated, 
this is the 10th conference. On this occasion we touched on 
topics that appear to be permament topics on our agendas. One 
is the topic of the fight against drug trafficking. This topic 
does not have the same implication in Cuba as in other countries 
because our society does not engage in using, trafficking, or 
producing drugs. For other countries, however, it does have a 
serious connotation. Some of those countries are drug producers 
and are hard hit by the drug trafficking problem. Although we 
do not have this problem in our country, it is a very useful 
topic because the experience of countries that are victims of 
this situation can always be learned from. They are teachings 
that benefit us because Cuba is fighting hard to prevent drug 
trafficking from invading us. This does not mean, however, that 
we are immune to it or are exempt from it. It could happen to 
us. Our duty, therefore, is to prepare technically and to learn 
about the problem, to be able to wage an anti-drug program if 
necessary. There are isolated cases, however, involving 
tourists. It is not a problem that affects us to the extent it 
affects other countries, however. 
  Another topic, which has been very important, is the topic 
of 
the family, which was discussed in recognition of the 
international year of the family. In this sense, the essence of 
the debate has centered on children who are abandoned and on the 
problem of adoption. 
  Of course, such topics are discussed fundamentally from a 
legal standpoint, considering juridical aspects. In the case of 
the family, the social aspect also plays an important role. 
Cuba has had many years of experience in which it has dedicated 
much attention to minors and devoted much attention to working 
mothers, so that children can be taken care of. Legally, our 
laws recognize the adoption problem. We have a family code 
which provides for discussion of the topic with special 
relevance. This shows the importance the revolution has always 
placed on the family, as the nucleus of society. In this sense, 
Cuba was able to contribute to the discussion. We had the 
opportunity to explain our experiences. Our proposal was well 
received. Many questions were asked and we heard of situations 
that exist in other countries. 
  [Otero] Thank you, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat, for 
your statements for Radio Havana Cuba.

<F P=106> [Report by Barbara Betancur on statements by Miguel Alfonso, </F>
spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast; passages within quotation marks 
recorded] 
  [Text] Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry, reported on the letter Cuban President Fidel Castro 
sent to Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. 
  [Alfonso] "He expressed our solidarity and said we share in 
their sorrow at this sad and difficult moment that Central 
America [as heard] is experiencing following the (?tragedy) in 
Huila and Cauca. As you know, a series of tremors have rocked 
that area and have resulted in heavy damage. In his letter, the 
commander in chief expresses to President Gaviria our feelings 
of fraternal understanding and adds that we share in their 
sorrow. At the same time, he says the Cuban Government is ready 
to send, at a moment's notice, an 18-person unit including 
doctors and technicians who are trained in this type of 
situation. The commander in chief has placed this unit at the 
disposal of the Colombian authorities should they need it." 
  I must add that the Cuban Public Health Ministry has formed 
the unit. Through its spokesman, the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
also expressed its pleasure with the recent statements by 
various international organizations regarding the lifting of the 
U.S. blockade against Cuba. Miguel Alfonso spoke, in 
particular, of Resolution 356 approved by the SELA [Latin 
American Economic System] Council. 
  [Alfonso] "This resolution is significant because it is the 
first time that SELA has approved a resolution directly 
rejecting something. As you know, SELA is an economic 
organization and all Latin American countries are members of 
this organization which Cuba helped found in 1970. This 
resolution, a copy of which you will receive shortly, not only 
supports the recent resolution issued by the UN General Assembly 
[UNGA] -- as you know, the UNGA approved its resolution in 
November -- but it also strongly urges the United States to lift 
the economic, commercial, and financial blockade on Cuba." 
  Likewise, Miguel Alfonso talked about the two paragraphs of 
the final declaration issued by the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM] 
ministerial meeting held in Cairo, Egypt. 
  [Alfonso] "Paragraph 161 strongly urges the expeditious and 
efficient implementation of the resolution that was approved not 
only in [words indistinct] but also in 1992 by the UNGA 
regarding the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  ``There is another paragraph [words indistinct] in which the 
NAM foreign ministers call on the developed countries to put an 
end to the generic implementation of all the unilateral coercive 
measures against developing countries. 
  ``I believe it is important we view this within a single 
context. These are not isolated things. The Cuban Foreign 
Ministry has observed that the international community is more 
frequently repudiating this measure which for more than 30 years 
has been affecting not only the economy but also the human 
rights of the Cuban people.'' 
  Alfonso also talked about the various lobbying actions 
conducted on Thursday by several U.S. congressmen, academicians, 
politicians, and members of nongovernmental organizations in 
favor of the lifting of the blockade. 
  [Alfonso] "I believe that the most important of these 
actions 
was the discussion of Cuba held in the U.S. Congress, specially 
in the U.S. Senate amphitheater. They talked about the 
situation the blockade creates for Cuba. The people who 
organized the day for lobbying in the United States had planned 
to hold approximately 35 meetings with U.S. congressmen, 
senators and members of the House of Representatives, to explain 
to them the impact the blockade has on Cuba and the need to 
adopt legislative and other measures to ensure that the blockade 
becomes something of the past." 
  In responding to several questions asked by reporters, 
Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, talked 
about recent statements made by the Honduran foreign minister, 
which were favorable for Cuba. 
  [Alfonso] "We have been seeing a series of reactions lately 
and it has become evident that it is no longer true that Cuba is 
isolated or that it is a country that cannot muster support and 
understanding from other countries. These reactions are coming 
not only from countries in the area, but from outside the 
continent as well." 
  Alfonso was also asked to appraise the meaning of the 
possibility that the Canadian Government will lift its embargo 
on Cuba. 
  [Alfonso] "We have learned that the Canadian Government will 
formally announce it will renew the aid it stopped a few years 
ago. This is significant because Cuba is confronting an 
economic situation and it does not take a genius to see that it 
is a difficult economic situation. This decision will 
contribute to improving the standard of living of the Cuban 
people. All aid to Cuba is very welcome." 
  These were some of the statements made by Miguel Alfonso, 
spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, during a meeting with 
the local and foreign media.

  [Text] Over 10,000 efficiency assemblies have been held in 
the country, it was stated by CTC [Cuban Workers Federation] 
Secretary General Pedro Ross in a meeting with a delegation of 
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions that is currently 
visiting Cuba. 
  Ross, who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba 
[PCC] politburo, explained to the labor union leaders of the 
friendly nation that the assembly process is a result of the 
Cuban workers' decision that labor unions become directly 
involved in the solution of problems at their enterprises in 
particular and the country in general. 
  Ross' statement was given at the Medical Biophysics Research 
Center, a leading institution in Santiago de Cuba's scientific 
sector that is in charge of manufacturing equipment for medical 
diagnoses and research on diseases through the use of nuclear 
magnetic resonance. 
  Xiao Zhenbang, a member of the PRC delegation, congratulated 
the workers for their achievments, and he urged them to continue 
their vital research for the development of the island's 
pharmaceutical and medical industry.

  [Text] Politburo member Jose Ramon Machado Ventura has 
participated in the District 27 progress report assembly in 
Guantanamo City. Machado witnessed an extensive debate with 
considerable participation by the people, who calmly suggested 
many ideas aimed at resolving shortages through local 
alternatives. Machado, who is Guantanamo Municipality's deputy 
to the National Assembly of the People's Government, was briefed 
on the efforts the population is making to recover from the 
recent rains, efforts not only in each neighborhood but also on 
the farms of the Segundo Frente Frank Pais contingent, which 
Machado also visited and praised: 
  [Begin Machado recording] This is heartwarming. Here, you 
can see the disposition and drive with which the people renew 
their work. [end recording] 
  Machado's tour of Guantanamo included an evaluation of a 
great number of Basic Cooperative Production Units, where the 
need to stabilize the work force was emphasized. The suggested 
solutions included improving living conditions, guaranteeing 
cost reductions, and increasing production.

congratulations to the members of the Western Army on tomorrow's

  [Palmero] "They have been a school for training cadres and

commitment to the work of the Revolution in these difficult 
times." 
  Palmero also highlighted the significant support of the 
troops in the province's agriculture. 
  [Palmero] "Approximately 2,000 members -- generals, 
officers, 
soldiers -- conducted the potato harvest, together with the 
Youth Labor Army [EJT]. Over 73 percent of the harvest was 
collected with enormous efficiency. Right now, the EJT is 50 
percent of the entire labor force in the province. They 
successfully complete their tasks with fewer men and more 
efficiency and productivity." 
  Palmero pointed out the influence of the Western Army in the 
combat training of the people in the province. 
  [Palmero] "During these 33 years, this command has done 
wonders for the defense of the Revolution. One of the most 
historic and difficult struggles has been that many of us, a 
great number of the population -- militants, workers, and 
farmers -- fulfilled internationalist missions while in the 
service of the Western Army. Many comrades of this command gave 
their lives in other lands."

<F P=106> [Studio interview with Brigadier General Raul Valle Valdez, </F>
chief of General Staff of the Western Army, by Roberto Cavada; 
from the "First Thing" program -- live] 
  [Text] [Cavada] We have with us Brigadier General Raul 
Valle Valdez, chief of General Staff of the Western Army, as 
well as Brigadier Gen. Harry Villega, chief of the political 
department of the Western Army. 
  Good morning. I am reminded of Che, for Villega had much to 
do with Che's involvement in Bolivia. But we can discuss that 
some other time. 
  Let us begin with the Western Army's combat readiness. The 
effort and commitment -- not only political commitment but also 
work commitment -- required to maintain an Armed Forces such as 
ours during such difficult times has always concerned me. We 
cannot afford to lose the commitment, spirit, and combat 
readiness of our troops and militiamen and of the people, in 
general, since this is the Armed Forces of the people in uniform. 
  How has the Western Army maintained combat readiness? What 
initiatives has it taken to maintain such high combat readiness 
levels? 
  [Valle] The commander in chief, the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces [FAR] minister, and the leadership of the Cuban Communist 
Party and Government have always known this. The guidelines our 
commander in chief issued before the special period were aimed 
at finding cheaper solutions to maintaining our combat training 
and readiness level, in light of the fact that Cuba was heading 
toward an energy crisis that would affect every aspect of 
national life. 
  We began to work on this immediately. Keep in mind that the 
special period began around the time the mission in Angola was 
ending. That is when we arrived in Cuba. From that point on, 
the Western Army engaged in those tasks with the other armies. 
Today, the people's combat training is more solid than ever. 
There is a certain amount of expertise involved in training 
regular troops for combat today, thanks to trainers who look for 
ways to improve combat training methods at integral training 
ranges and at relatively smaller ranges. Command and control 
exercises and training and general staff's and chief's exercises 
upgrade cadre training. We have managed to make the soldiers' 
overall training much more efficient and have increased the 
recruits' basic training time from eight to 10 weeks, allowing 
soldiers to arrive at their units with higher quality training. 
This has allowed us to maintain the Armed Forces' combat 
training and readiness levels despite the ongoing special period. 
  [Cavada] Yes. Above all, the austerity and commitment to 
continuing the training and to not lowering the combat training 
and readiness levels has prevailed. 
  I would like to discuss later the Western Army's 33 years 
and, specifically, how lately, due to the economic situation 
facing Cuba, the Army has engaged in productive tasks. Armies 
worldwide are unproductive state institutions which feed off the 
government and state budget. In Cuba's case, there has been a 
willingness and commitment to turn the army into a productive 
sector to benefit the army itself and the rest of the population.

  [Text] In 1993, Cuba invested more than $1.7 million in 
social security , some $4 million every 24 hours. [sentence as 
heard] Orlando Penante, social security director of the Cuban 
Labor Ministry, has indicated that those figures do not include 
the costs of social assistance programs, which amount to another 
$35 million. Penante stated that despite the economic hardships 
Cuba is facing, the number of retirees and pensioners covered by 
the social security system has increased in the 50 years of the 
special period in peacetime. The number of subjects covered by 
social security also surpasses the funds allocated for this 
purpose.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Davalos from the "Exclusive" program] </F>
  [Text] On this occasion I do not want to add another word 
to a news item that appeared recently on the inside pages of 
GRANMA, lost among other news with more appealing headlines. 
This information, however, is a bombshell. The dateline on the 
item is Cabaiguan, Sancti Spiritus Province, and in its first 
paragraph, the leader as we reporters say, informs that the 
Sergio Soto Refinery has produced, for the first time, oil for 
electric transformers. This oil is used within the transformers, 
vital electrical equipment used for transmitting and 
distributing electricity. This is an extraordinary 
accomplishment, not because it is a first, but because it is an 
expensive resource that Cuba has been forced to import. Cuba has 
had to and has to import it because without transformers there 
is no electric energy going anywhere. Therefore when the 
production of this oil increases and stabilizes we will be freed 
from a heavy burden. 
  Reporter Juan Antonio Boreu's news item was very extensive. 
I 
believe it is loaded with new and good things, in a little over 
a column. We turn each line written into a good commentary. 
  The reporter from Cabaiguan informs that this small 
refinery, 
founded before the triumph of the Revolution, where gasoline was 
produced and marketed under the name of (Reca), now produces the 
I-12 oil, oil used in the production of industrial oils; 
(Termosic) oil, a special oil used by industrial plants; 
(Fibrasin) oil, used in the production of rope; and the 
(Sigrafic) solvent used in the cleanup of printing equipment. 
  All these products are very expensive in terms of hard 
currency. Their production in Cabaiguan is an important event. 
The report points out that at the refinery's basic oils plant, 
the only one of its kind in Cuba, cooling oils are produced from 
water used in cleaning. This product, of fundamental importance, 
is used in tooling equipment. 
  The Sergio Soto Refinery has also achieved the 
neutralization 
of its highly corrosive and polluting level of residual 
discharges. The refinery converted the discharges into another 
energy resource which fuels the nearby Siboney Cement Factory. 
  What more can be said, things speak for themselves. We see 
here several things, the first of which is the skill and 
determination of the refinery's technicians and workers, which 
should be praised. There is something here that I have not 
mentioned but which is essential: If the special basic oils 
produced by the refinery were to be imported, as we have done 
before, they would be very expensive, if available on the market 
at all. These oils are produced here thanks to the petroleum 
obtained from Ciego de Avila's Pina oil deposit, of excellent 
quality. This new oil field, discovered two years ago, has not 
been characterized by huge production but by the low density of 
its crude oil, which makes it ideal for the production of these 
lubricants. 
  I believe I have been unsuccessful in my attempt to not add 
words to this information sent from Cabaiguan, yet it was not 
bad to repeat it, especially because it was good news. Not 
because it was well written but because it contains elements 
that denote the struggle of our people to move forward in the 
midst of the special period.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lourdes Mijan, province director for </F>
aqueducts, sewers, and culverts, by correspondent Heidi Gonzalez 
Cabrera at Arroyo Naranjo Municipality; for the "Exclusive" 
program -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Gonzalez] We are here at Arroyo Naranjo 
Municipality, where we have an appointment with Lourdes Mijan, 
province director for aqueducts, sewers, and culverts. She has 
kindly accepted our request for a meeting. Lourdes, we have 
received many telephone calls since yesterday. I will summarize 
them so you can provide the answers. The people ask about 
possible programs for the elimination of public faucets; the 
outrageous prices charged for water supplied by water tank 
trucks in zones where there is no water -- people are really 
feeling the effects of this; and the possibility of repairing 
the cracks that have appeared at the Vento Canal. That is all 
for now. 
  [Mijan] Well, referring to your first question, I must tell 
you we have a program for the elimination of public faucets. 
The program began many years ago with the creation of local 
aqueduct brigades in each of the people's councils. These local 
brigades began to work but their work is currently curtailed by 
the lack of resources. We expect to solve certain problems 
concerning the availability of materials for the aqueducts 
beginning the second semester of 1994 -- through a credit from 
France to the Institute of Hydraulic Resources. Some of our 
most critical problems involve the lack of galvanized pipes and 
copper pipes. I believe we are not in a much more critical 
situation thanks to the efforts exerted by the local aqueduct 
workers and the presidents of the people's councils, who strive 
to help us, as well as the industries, the aid, and all the 
other factors. We hope we will be able to have the minimum 
amount of materials in a short time to solve the most critical 
problems we have concerning public faucets on the streets. 
  There is also a support program for the faucets installed in 
larger pipes. In fact, I can announce the Micons [Construction 
Ministry] will help us (?locate) some of the faucets installed 
in larger pipes. Specifically, the Micons delegation in Havana 
will help us solve the problem concerning faucets on the main 
pipe in Ariguanabo and the main pipe from El Gato acqueduct, 
which currently faces a critical situation. We are also 
preparing a program with the Institute for Hydraulic Resources 
and the Havana authorities to get some urgently needed 
resources. We expect this will be solved in a few days. Thus, 
we will recover the losses -- considerable losses -- currently 
experienced by the acqueduct. We believe this will improve the 
water supply to the city. 
  [Gonzalez] What about the water tank trucks? 
  [Mijan] The service rendered by the acqueduct's water tank 
trucks is free and anyone who violates this is liable to be 
fined and expelled from his post. The water tank trucks have a 
big sign which says free service and that is how it should be 
rendered. Many times they are not water tank trucks from the 
acqueduct and in other cases the people agree to pay a high 
price for the water -- yet they do not want to report the one 
who incurs in the violation. We urge the population to report 
the license plate, the driver's name, the information they can 
get; and we are willing to guarantee the people that we will 
strictly deal with whoever uses the people's needs to earn a 
profit. 
  [Gonzalez] We believe you have been very considerate toward 
us but I would like an opportunity -- in a future meeting, in 
the near future -- to talk with someone from the sewer 
department to talk about a very unpleasant topic -- the (?holes) 
and drainage ditches we have all over the city. Is that 
possible? 
  [Mijan] Of course. I think Engineer Carlos Menendez, our 
assistant director for sewers, would be willing to do that. We 
will instruct him to answer the questions you have from the 
people, from the program's listeners, on this topic, which is 
also an important topic and which affects the people very much. 
  [Gonzalez] Very well. We believe you and we thank you very 
much for the time you have given us. We will talk about the 
Vento Canal on another occasion. It deserves a special time. 
We have not forgotten it. Well, that is all for today, my 
friends. We thank Lourdes Mijan for all the time she has 
granted us. She will return to the meeting from which we 
brought her out. We will return tomorrow.

  [Text] The Electric Union has issued a detailed report on 
electricity generating capacity, pointing out that increased 
capacity meant shorter outages last week. The Electric Union 
predicts that the system will continue behaving like this until 
15 June. The report also notes that the average deficit was 
reduced significantly between 2 and 8 June and that the 
electrical generating level in the last few weeks has exceeded 
what was expected, increasing consumption of fuel reserved for 
that purpose. 
  The truth is that the situation today is very different from 
that in April, when the outages were prolonged due to breakdowns 
at power plants without adequate maintenance program. The 
generating capacity now increases daily. It was also confirmed 
that Mariel Power Plant Unit 6 has been reincorporated into the 
national electrical network. This unit, which can generate 100 
megawatts, was off line for more than a year while Cuban 
specialists completed their complex reconstruction task.

  [text] The 13 June TRABAJADORES features an editorial on 
the effects that increased prices and fees for some products and 
services are having on salaries. Money lacks value when it does 
not have the backing of goods and services because real income 
does not depend on the amount of circulating currency but on its 
purchasing power. TRABAJADORES adds that the black market is a 
parasitic and unproductive economy since it does not help to 
produce more goods, which is what is needed to increase supply. 
Our country is developing an economic outline of its own, and 
every measure must be seen as linked to others. The goal is to 
boost work, but for the moment this is not possible because 
production is limited due to lack of resources and raw 
materials. Steps are being taken on performance incentives on 
tourism, agriculture, mining, transportation, energy, and the 
sugar industry, among other sectors. TRABAJADORES also points 
out that formulas to stimulate production can be found in each 
workplace, without forgetting that the goal is to revalue the 
currency.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 10 June carries a 15-minute edition of its 
regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Eloy 
Concepcion, from TRABAJADORES newspaper, and host Osvaldo 
Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine. 
  Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that measures 
increasing prices and deregulating sales of cigarettes and rum 
have significantly influenced the market and buyers. 
  Concepcion states that consumers and speculators have not 
hoarded these products since they went on deregulated sale. He 
adds that many people feared the cigarettes were stale but this 
is not the case. The warehouses had stockpiled cigarettes to 
ensure that supply would meet demand. Concepcion adds that 
speculators are holding back, given that the media has reported 
the factories have the conditions to continue producing 50 
million cigarettes a day. 
  Rodriguez states the fight has been won as long as the 
cigarette industry is able to maintain the flow of production. 
Concepcion states that he believes that after years of 
gratuities, the first big lesson the people have learned is to 
be aware of home and personal finances. He adds that the basic 
quota of four boxes has gone from costing 20 cents each to 
costing 2 pesos each, and the two additional boxes were 1.6 
pesos each and now cost six pesos each. Concepcion adds that rum 
has gone from 7.2 pesos to 13.75 pesos, and that next September 
the cost of electricity will increase and transportation and 
water services have already been increased in order to mend the 
national finances. He adds: "We have to say it clearly. This 
affects the people's pocket. The Cuban people will learn to 
live on a budget, which is something we never thought about 
because the state took care of us." 
  Concepcion goes on to say that the current tobacco harvest 
has been outstanding, adding: "This year's tobacco crop is a 
slap in the face to those who think that socialism is incapable 
of organizing efficient agriculture." 
  Rodriguez states that the measures have benefited smokers 
because the black market can no longer charge 30 pesos for a box 
because consumers can now buy three boxes for 30 pesos. He adds 
that undoubtedly the people will have to learn to live on a 
budget and that near the cigarette factory in Ranchuelo, people 
are illegally selling cigarettes stolen from that factory in the 
streets and that the factory's workers, management, party cell, 
and union representatives have to solve that problem. 
  Rodriguez closes by stating that stealing from the cigarette 
factories is widespread, adding: "As long as this lack of 
control prevails, we will not be able to sustain a stable 
production."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Cuban economic developments monitored from Havana 
radio and television sources in Spanish between 6 and 10 June: 
  Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0900 GMT on 6 
June 
carries a report on the Arturo Almeida Credit and Services 
Cooperative in Las Yeguas, a rural settlement in Aguada de 
Pasajeros Municipality, Cienfuegos Province. Foreman Roberto 
Gonzalez Santana says their main crop is sugarcane, but they 
also have cattle. He adds that the sugarcane harvest has just 
concluded and their yield was 53,000 arrobas per caballeria, 
which is considered very high. He also talks about milk 
production, which is very low -- only 5 liters per cow -- due to 
the dry season. 
  Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 0900 GMT also features a 
financial report on Cienfuegos Province enterprises during the 
first semester. The information reveals that "46 enterprises 
were profitable, but a similar amount reported losses, adding 
that employment and salary figures registered in 1989 remained 
the same in 1993, but that production dropped 40 percent. The 
tendency to pay subsidies increased." The report says efforts to 
solve this situation include allowing the municipal authorities 
to manage their funds, thus enabling them to prevent squandering 
and to increase revenues. 
  Radio Reloj at 1339 GMT on 6 June reports that the joint 
Cuban-Spanish enterprise Gaviota S.A. plans to build in Cayo 
Guajaba, Camaguey, a four-star, 1920's-style sea resort which, 
by the peak of the 1995 season, will comprise 80 cabanas. 
  Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 8 June reports that 
agricultrual 
workers in Guantanamo are striving to lower production costs by 
harvesting plantains before they ripen. So far they have 
harvested 85,000 quintals of plantains. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 8 June reports that "Farallon 
del Caribe" hotel in Granma Province has collected more than 
$600,000 since its inauguration in November. 
  Radio Rebelde also reports that construction workers of the 
Jose Maceo contingent in Santiago de Cuba and workers of the 
geology-mining enterprise in Oriente work 14 hours per day to 
repair the salt mining enterprise in Caimanera. This plant, 
which produces more than 75 percent of the salt consumed in Cuba 
was affected by the floods of May. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that the Mexican 
Embassy in Cuba donated more than 400 books to the Jose Marti 
Library in Havana. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that the bakers 
union of Madrid and bakers union in Havana signed document of 
intention for cooperation this area between the two cities. The 
document establishes the holding of seminars and conferences. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that Las Tunas 
Province has planted 1,852 caballerias of vegetables, fruits, 
and tubers, which is the highest level of its history and 
equivalent to 84 percent of its territory. Of the 1,852 
caballerias, 960 are plantain crops. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that the 
approximately 8,000 self employed workers in Pinar del Rio 
Province contributed more than 1.5 million pesos so far this 
year. Despite this, the average income per capita remains low, 
according to specialists. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 9 June reports that food, 
medicine, school materials, and medical equipment arrived today 
to Cuban ports from Vigo, Spain, on board the Cuban ship Rio 
Jibacoa. Jose Ramon Fernandez, vice president of the council of 
Ministers, received the donations made by different solidarity 
groups from Galicia. In addition to the aforementioned goods, 
the donation also includes five vehicles, including a truck. 
Another donation consisting of 23 packages of medicine also 
arrived on board the ship, which was donated by the Miguel 
Hernandez Friendship Organization. 
  Nine of Havana Province's 19 municipalities are 
self-sufficient in terms of food production, and they have 
allocated 202 caballerias to help increase the amount of food 
available for the population. 
  Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 10 June, citing an AFP report, 
says that the Cuban Government has asked the president of the 
Peruvian Rice Growers Association for 100,000 tonnes of rice in 
exchange for cattle, medicine, and equipment.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro De Leon Carpio by Edgar </F>
Gudiel at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City; from the 
"Channel Seven News" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpts] [Gudiel] Good evening, dear viewers of "Channel 
Seven News." Welcome to this special interview with the 
Constitutional president of the Republic, Ramiro De Leon Carpio. 
  Yesterday marked 365 days since President De Leon Carpio 
took 
office and, of course, the Guatemalan people would like to know 
what has truly happened during those 365 days. What has the 
president, his cabinet and his work team really done to benefit 
the Guatemalan people. [passage omitted] 
  Mr. President, welcome to this edition of "Channel Seven 
News." Thanks for accepting the invitation to talk, not with me, 
but with the Guatemalan people. 
  I believe the events at the end of May and early June 1993 
are still fresh in the minds of the Guatemalan people. Perhaps 
the best question to begin this interview with President De Leon 
Carpio might be, what was the condition of the country when you 
took office on 6 June 1993? What caused this situation? 
  [De Leon] I believe that is a very scientific way of 
establishing whether or not there have been achievements. 
First, you must know what the situation was, where Guatemala 
was headed, how President Serrano was ruling the country, what 
was happening, and what the situation was when President De Leon 
Carpio took office. This is the logical, fundamental way to 
profoundly and seriously examine my first year in office. I 
would divide the answer into five aspects: press, international 
affairs, and the three broad areas of policy, economics and 
social issues. I will broach the first. 
  I was presented with a country that had a terrible 
international image, a Guatemala that was totally isolated from 
the international community precisely because of President 
Serrano Elias' disruption of institutional order. This total 
isolation was nefarious and negative. This was the 
international situation I encountered. 
  Regarding the press, I say the news media are the expression 
of fundamental freedom, of individual and social human rights 
which are very important because they are the pillars of 
democracy. Remember how things were a year ago in May? The 
government and the president directly harassed not only 
reporters but the news media. There was total disruption and 
incidents took place that had never taken place in Guatemalan 
history, not even during the dictatorships. This was the 
situation I encountered in these two aspects. 
  Regarding the broad areas of policy, economics, and social 
issues, I would begin with policy because the people had 
recently rescued themselves from the abyss into which President 
Serrano was leading them with his disruption of institutional 
and constitutional order, his anarchy, and his extreme 
authoritarianism. The people demanded a reform and a 
reorganization of the three branches of state, and they staged 
demonstrations. In the political sphere there was always an 
urgent desire to cleanse the government and to break with the 
past. We were in a state of political upheaval that united 
various sectors, but my arrival was politically motivated. I 
arrived at the presidency to rescue institutional order and this 
is what I encountered. 
  In the economic aspect, inflation rose to 14 percent in 1992 
and the situation in 1993 was quite difficult. The treasury was 
totally empty, and there were debts in every area. To mention a 
few, in the area of health, the hospitals had a debt of 130 
million quetzales, the internal debt surpassed 900 million 
quetzales, the government had been unable to reduce the foreign 
debt and the international monetary reserve did not amount to 
$500 million. In other words, the situation was chaotic. 
  The general public may not have noticed, but when the 
president took office he faced an empty treasury, debts, and of 
course, the distrust of investors. There was no security for 
foreign or local investors, our economic situation was totally 
outdated, and prices for staple products were in utter disarray. 
  As for social matters, the country was in total upheaval. 
Remember that a year ago vans and buses were being burned in the 
streets, a student was murdered by a deputy's bodyguard, and 
there were demonstrations and riots. The social upheaval was 
palpable. People in the countryside were not participating in 
social projects. There was a total lack of confidence in the 
government for its misuse of state resources and the millions it 
spent from secret funds. All in all, it was a chaotic situation 
in every respect: economic, political, and social. 
  I must add that overnight, 72 hours before taking office -- 
I 
did not even know I was going to be president -- I encountered 
this difficult situation. Analysts say that no president has 
ever taken office in Guatemala under such unfavorable 
conditions. It has been a tremendous challenge, and to answer 
your question, that was the situation I faced. 
  [Gudiel] There was definitely chaos in Guatemala. Mr. 
President, 365 days have gone by. You have served one year of 
the two and a half you will be in office. After 365 days, have 
things improved? What is your opinion? Briefly, please, 
because I have many questions to ask you before our viewers 
start calling. 
  [De Leon] Very well. Along the same lines I mentioned, I 
believe our international situation is totally different. After 
being internationally isolated, Guatemala is now recognized by 
the international community. I might add, without false 
modesty, that the Guatemalan president has considerable prestige 
among the international community. The international community 
supports and backs the Guatemalan president and the 
administration over which I am honored to preside. The 
isolation I found has been totally reversed. 
  [Gudiel, interrupting] Nevertheless, and forgive me for 
interrupting, Mr. President, but you mentioned five points and 
now you are going to defend them. We are on the first one. 
  [De Leon] I am not going to defend them. I am going to make 
a comparison. I answered your question about the condition in 
which I found the country in terms of those five aspects, and 
now I will explain the current situation. 
  [Gudiel] You will compare one with the other. What about 
the travel warning? [previous two words in English] 
  [De Leon] Well, that is something very special. The travel 
warning was issued for Guatemala because of certain situations 
and due to incidents like the recent explosion of a terrorist 
bomb at a residence. 
  [Gudiel, interrupting] We opened our newscast with that 
information today. 
  [De Leon] Exactly. It is part of an internal 
destabilization plan because that is the only way to delay the 
attainment of peace. The travel warning is the result of a 
series of manipulated situations, and we are struggling against 
them. Their origins are not in the international community but 
in sources that are foreign to the states. When I say that upon 
arrival I found Guatemala to be internationally isolated, it is 
because international doors were totally closed. 
  [Gudiel] It pleased us very much to see the Costa Rican 
president in Peten yesterday. 
  [De Leon] That was a truly historic event. In the past we 
had to go to Costa Rica. Guatemalan presidents would wait for 
invitations from Costa Rica because it was the only democratic 
country. It was a luxury for a Guatemalan president to go to 
Costa Rica. That, however, is no longer the case. The Costa 
Rican president asked me to invite him on a working tour and he 
visited Peten. This proves -- and here I speak of Asia, Europe, 
and Latin America -- that there is support for the president and 
the administration. In short, Guatemala is no longer isolated 
from the concert of nations. That is the situation from the 
international viewpoint. 
  As far as the news media are concerned, I will say little 
because the differences are obvious. Following the harassment 
suffered by the news media in the past in what I would describe 
as a war waged by [former] President Serrano with an 
authoritarianism unprecedented in Guatemalan history, after 
those attacks on reporters, the news media, and so forth, there 
is now full and absolute freedom of the media and expression. 
  There are isolated problems. Problems exist in Guatemala as 
they do everywhere in the world, but freedom of the media and of 
expression are pillars of democracy that I defend and practice. 
This government has been and will continue to be tolerant, 
because I believe in freedom of expression and of the media. 
  Let's move on and discuss the three main areas. As for the 
political aspect, our main problem was the disruption of 
constitutional order. That order has never been as preserved, 
strengthened, and supported as it is now by the Guatemalan Army. 
As I said before, and because we are talking in such a [word 
indistinct], pleasant, honest, and open manner, I am not losing 
any sleep over a possible coup d'etat. That is entirely out of 
the question. 
  [Gudiel, interrupting] Do you sleep soundly? 
  [De Leon] I sleep very soundly, particularly if I am 
exhausted after a hard day of work. Economic and social 
problems keep me awake and concern me, but the prospect of a 
coup d'etat does not. I am categorical about this because coups 
d'etat are a part of our history that we have overcome. All 
Army officers are aware of their professional responsibility and 
the role they should play in a democracy. This circumstance, 
which did not exist when I took office, has helped preserve and 
reinforce constitutional order. Previously the country's 
constitutional order was undermined by the rupture created by 
this organization. 
  People also asked me to purge state organizations; that is, 
the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. That purge 
is nearly a reality. Although I took the long way -- the legal 
and democratic path which I had to choose -- we are only two 
months away from a new Congress and two and a half months from a 
new Supreme Court of Justice. In sum, the political problems I 
encountered when I became president are close to a resolution. 
It has taken some time, if you will, but the legal path 
required time. This choice led to the constitutional reforms 
which -- despite criticisms against the referendum -- are being 
implemented and are yielding results. I will give you several 
brief examples. 
  First, the constitutional reform is yielding results in 
terms 
of pretrial proceedings. For the first time in Guatemalan 
history, a deputy has been separated from his post. It was made 
possible by a change in procedure. Now the deputies cannot be 
judges and defendants at the same time. The organization has 
changed. This has helped eliminate the prevailing political 
impunity. Discretionary funds are another example. The 
president eliminated confidential expenditures last year, and 
this year those funds were transferred to areas such as family 
and education. Discretionary funds were entirely eliminated 
from all state organizations by a constitutional reform. In 
addition to being an extremely significant and unprecedented 
step in Latin America, this step precludes corruption because, 
as we all know, discretionary funds often give rise to acts of 
corruption. On the other hand, a constitutional reform also 
gave full autonomy and independence to the prosecutor, attorney 
general, and comptroller general. There is also a reform 
regarding the prohibition of domestic debt without collateral 
and the nonissuance of currency without reserves. At that time 
people demanded several constitutional reforms. Now the 
situation is different. 
  As for the economic aspect, I cannot give you many details, 
but at the end of 1993, inflation was at 11.6 percent, which is 
a substantial reduction from 14 percent in 1992. This year we 
are aiming for a 10-percent inflation rate. The foreign debt 
has been reduced by $174 million. The internal debt of the Bank 
of Guatemala to the central government has been reduced by $484 
million quetzales. The national currency has been stabilized 
and strengthened. In addition, for the first time in many 
years, international monetary reserves have reached $801 
million. The situation is different despite the widely known 
difficulties and circumstances. 
  As for the social aspect, I found a nation immersed in total 
chaos and without any confidence to participate. Now there is 
administrative and economic decentralization and a drive toward 
increasing social participation. Above all, based on the 
principles of honesty, clarity, and authority, the Guatemalan 
community participates in social projects. As a result, and 
based on available information, I think the situation has 
changed. 
  In terms of investment, operational costs represented 60 to 
65 percent of the budget, yet the government was never able to 
reach a 30-percent investment level. It was never able to 
invest more than 20 percent. Now the budget has a 28-percent 
investment level and 50-percent operational costs. In 12 months 
we have been able to do what was not achieved in many decades: 
invest 67 percent of the full amount programmed. Previous 
governments were only able to achieve 35 to 40 percent. That is 
the difference between the previous and current situation. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Gudiel] Mr. President, you were a renowned human rights 
ombudsman. Everyone knows that you did an excellent job, and 
that is why virtually everyone asked that you be chosen to 
replace President Serrano Elias. What is the current human 
rights situation? For example, what is the status of the 
notorious obligatory military recruitment, an everyday news 
story that receives a lot of attention from the people and the 
media. What is your view on this issue, and how can this 
recruitment, which is undoubtedly needed to maintain the Army, 
be done without harming the rights of the citizens being 
recruited? 
  [De Leon] With regard to an overall reply on human rights, 
I am not the one to give this answer. It is the institution in 
charge of this matter, it is the human rights ombudsman; he will 
issue a report at the year's end. There is also Monica Pinto at 
the international level. We currently have a list of 
recommendations from [name indistinct] as well as from Monica 
Pinto. We are trying to comply to the greatest extent all the 
recommendations. 
  We believe that at the end of the year we will have a very, 
very positive report. Of course, this does not mean that no 
more individual human rights violations will occur; the main 
source of these violations is political violence, the internal 
armed conflict. I pointed this out when I was ombudsman, and I 
repeat this now. Until this internal armed conflict is solved, 
the main cause, the main source of these individual human rights 
violations will not be eliminated. I am referring to the right 
to life, physical integrity, dignity, security, freedom, and so 
forth. 
  Now, as far as economic, cultural, and social human rights 
are concerned, these continue being violated, however, here I am 
referring to a more structural matter. Nevertheless, what is 
true is that no government can accuse this government of 
engaging in systematic violations, as a result of a government 
policy, a state policy. This no longer exists. Here I make a 
comparison once again. When I took office I found a situation 
of human rights violations, I dare not say as a government 
policy because at that time a policy such as that no longer 
existed. Currently, however, there is a very big difference. 
Here I am going to repeat the words I spoke as ombudsman about 
human rights violations. There can be no conditional response 
to this if human rights have more or less been violated. Either 
they are respected or they are violated. 
  In this case, I seek to leave my successor a legacy of a 
nation where human rights are totally respected. In those cases 
-- as happens in any part of the world -- where a human right is 
violated, the person responsible must be tried and punished, no 
matter who it is and what institution he belongs to. This is in 
broad terms. I would like to say that for me it is very 
satisfactory that the situation is different, even though there 
are still isolated problems. 
  With regard to military recruitment, in principle, as I have 
always said, this is a right but at the same time a duty. This 
is set out in the Constitution, it is not the Army that decides 
there must be recruitment, rather this is a constitutional duty. 
This is stated in the Constitution. 
  There have been three types of problems -- I pointed this 
out 
when I was ombudsman -- and they continue occurring although on 
a much lower scale. We have data, statistics on these problems. 
One has to do with discrimination, the second is the methods 
used, and the third has to do with cases in which minors are 
involved. One must acknowledge.... [pauses] the very defense 
minister acknowledged the other day, that there are problems, of 
course errors exist. Nevertheless, this year a very special 
phenomena has occurred. That is, in the majority of the 
departments there has been a large voluntary flow of young 
peasants enlisting. Maybe it is for the salary, or due to 
necessity, in any case they come of their own free will. We 
have statistics on this. This has avoided greater problems, 
although they continue to exist, this must be acknowledged. 
What are the solutions? One is in the law. There is a draft 
bill that was presented some time ago to the Congress; however, 
it has been placed on the back burner. I do not think there is 
any hope that this Congress will pass this law. 
  [Gudiel] That will not be until after 14 August.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] That is a possibility. The solution 
is there, a law. Subsequently, as you said at the beginning of 
your question, we must take into account reality. The army 
anywhere in the world where it is organized constitutionally, as 
in Guatemala, is an army that requires recruitment. Logically 
this must be in a form regulated by the corresponding laws, and 
in this case it should be. Now, we must recall that there is 
still an internal armed confrontation going on. Anyone who says 
there should be no forced recruitment is either naive or wants 
the Army to not have the means to face a subversive group. He 
does not want to face the situation, and face an obligation, the 
goal for which the Army has been constitutionally created. That 
is, to maintain the nation's domestic peace and security. That 
is the reply to that question. 
  Now I believe this is part of an overall situation we are 
experiencing that is drawing us closer to peace. As I did not 
touch the political aspect of this issue I want to take this 
opportunity to explain the peace process situation as it was one 
year ago and how it is now. A year ago this process was totally 
bogged down and we have never been so close to peace as now. An 
overall human rights agreement has been signed. This was the 
Gordian knot that one year ago did not allow the process to 
advance. A timetable has been signed. In this timetable there 
is a cease-fire slated for September. We have hopes that the 
cease-fire will take place before, we have hopes that the URNG 
will accept it taking place before. Nevertheless, by September 
there must be a demobilization and in December the signing of 
the peace agreement. 
  [Words indistinct] there is a great difference. When I took 
office on 6 June, the process was totally bogged down. There 
was no credibility in the peace process. Currently we are one 
step from achieving peace; however, this is the most difficult 
step. This is why there currently is terrorism, this is why 
there is upheaval, this is why there is a series of created, 
provoked deteriorations. I fear that the current URNG 
philosophy, strategy -- given it is not prepared to join 
national political life -- is to prolong the situation. This is 
the reason for the acts of terrorism, this is the reason for the 
provoked upheavals, this is the reason the very xenophobia was 
created in some places. It was not by chance that these 
problems arose. 
  I have taken this opportunity to touch on the issue of peace 
because it embodies the overall human rights agreement. It also 
draws us to something very important: that Guatemala can end the 
internal armed conflict that has been going on for more than 
three decades. This has left behind a balance of hundreds of 
thousands of dead, widows, orphans, shedding of tears, 
destruction, desolation, hate, and resentment. When the end of 
this armed conflict comes, we will be faced with an even more 
difficult task: for this to be a lasting peace. For this we 
must continue combating poverty, eliminating those possible 
causes that could give way to new discontent. Because in a 
country.... 
  [Gudiel, interrupting] This is what practically gave origin 
to the problem.... 
  [De Leon, interrupting] To some extent yes. At that time, it 
was a mixed political-ideological situation. Currently the flag 
could be merely economic. This is what must be avoided so that 
this current effort, ending the conflict and attaining peace, is 
for something. That is, that in our country all those dead, all 
that blood that was shed, not be repeated. That it be a lasting 
peace. This is why we must give macroeconomics a human face, a 
social face. We must combat poverty, this is the core of our 
government program. Take those small projects, which I mentioned 
a while ago and commented on by some, those 12,000 almost 13,000 
small projects we concluded in 12 months. Those projects have 
not only supplied potable water, electricity, pedestrian 
crossings, telephone service, and others, but they have given 
back hope. This is the most important; the return of hope to a 
people who had lost it. Before this hope was returned they were 
probably easier prey to the guerrilla's language, to their 
words. This no longer holds true. Currently a hamlet such as 
[word indistinct] where potable water supply was taken, the 
leaders themselves said: Here there is not a remote possibility 
that someone will get involved in some [word indistinct] 
movement, in some guerrilla movement. 
  We now realize that we can improve our standard of living; 
we 
can emerge from those situations of wantonness, if water is 
supplied, if electricity is supplied, if there is honesty, if 
there is social investment, such as we are currently doing.

<F P=106> [Report by Carlos Castanaza] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman reported 
yesterday on her participation in the 11th Nonaligned Movement 
[NAM] Ministerial Conference held recently in Cairo, Egypt. She 
explained that she had stopped the organization from accepting 
inaccurate proposals that attempted to obtain statements of 
support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize, 
thus, ignoring the existence of the territorial dispute. 
  Confronted with such attempts, her delegation acted to 
safeguard the country's interests and was able to get the NAM 
Declaration to be more balanced, limiting it to calling upon 
Belize and Guatemala to discuss and resolve the dispute, which 
had not been achieved at this forum previously. She asserted 
that the government agreed with the NAM statement because 
Guatemala's position had not been omitted. To the benefit of 
both parties, the declaration backed the negotiations and, by 
not polarizing the situation, established the necessary climate 
for it, she added. 
  She highlighted as special achievements her participation as 
vice president of the conference and Colombia's selection to 
chair the next NAM presidential summit of member countries to be 
held in 1998. Above all, we managed to get a special 
pronouncement in favor of Guatemala -- something that is 
uncommon -- to support the efforts being made by De Leon Carpio 
to further the democratization and peace processes, she 
emphasized. 
  On ending, Vielman stated that the officials who attended 
the 
NAM Ministerial Conference had attempted to redefine the 
movement's role in the new international context and had 
reaffirmed its objective of furthering the developing countries' 
struggle to advance. 
  The meeting was attended by 130 delegates, of which 109 were 
from member countries. We took advantage of this situation and 
held bilateral meetings with most of the representatives at the 
meeting, she added.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The U.S. 
Government's influence over other arms manufacturing nations is 
making it difficult for Guatemala to equip the National Police 
properly, government sources reported today. 
  Deputy Government Minister Luis Augusto Merida told ACAN-EFE 
it is difficult for the government to obtain arms following the 
U.S. State Department's decision to ban the sale of arms to 
Guatemala because of the human rights violations in the country. 
He said, "we cannot deny the U.S. Government's influence over 
the rest of the world," because several countries, including 
Belgium and Germany, which had offered to equip the National 
Police, later changed their minds and refused. Germany also has 
endorsed the travel warning the U.S. State Department issued 
against visiting Guatemala because of attacks on foreigners. 
  President de Leon Carpio had earlier complained about 
certain 
governments, which he did not identify, for demanding that 
Guatemala keep crime in check while refusing to sell arms to 
civilian security forces because of human rights violations. 
  Merida said that, for the time being, the government is 
negotiating with Israeli manufacturers who can "provide a 
minimum of equipment." Merida expects a counteroffer to a 
proposal presented last week. The government intends to spend 
approximately 20 million quetzals (some $3.48 million) for 
semi-automatic weapons and another 15 million quetzals (some 
$2.61 million) for vehicles for the National Police. 
  Merida, a former head of the Army's intelligence section, 
said: "We need semi-automatic, carbine-type rifles. We just 
cannot go on using six-shot revolvers" while criminals are 
better equipped. He estimates each rifle will cost $1,000. The 
expense will be higher than anticipated, however, because "it is 
more expensive to import arms from Israel than from the United 
States." 
  Merida said the State Department's ban is heeded by U.S. 
suppliers who fill orders from local Guatemalan dealers, who in 
turn sell the arms to civilians, not the Army. "Some local 
stores have stopped selling ammunition to the military," who 
purchased it for their personal arms, the source said. He added 
that he cannot buy arms for the police through local 
corporations because the owners refuse to deal with the Army, 
"either out of fear of losing their visas or their import 
permits." 
  The National Police, founded 113 years ago with a regulation 
enacted in 1955, has been in the sights of the international 
community, which has reported human rights violations.

<F P=106> [Address to the nation by provisional President Emile </F>
Jonassaint; passages within italics in Creole -- recorded] 
  [Text] Men and women of my country: I have decided to 
address the nation tonight. It is a serious moment. Haiti, our 
country, is in great danger. Reviled, ridiculed, humiliated, and 
strangled, Haiti risks invasion and occupation. I appear before 
you tonight with certainty and faith, determination, and the 
courage of men of peace and goodwill. As president of the 
Republic -- the one who is primarily responsible for the 
nation's fate -- it is incumbent upon me to fully assume the 
responsibilities of our time before the Haitian people and the 
international community. Without beating about the bush and with 
all the necessary serenity, and invested with all the authority 
of my office, I clearly state that history, the Constitution, 
and the permanence of our deep values forbid me from giving in 
to threats, and imperatively orders me to defend, by all means, 
the imperiled fatherland. It will be defended. 
  Tonight, I come to ask you -- all quarrels and disagreements 
aside -- to mobilize for the defense of our country. I solemnly 
declare that Haiti will not give in. Haiti will not submit to 
orders from foreigners. Haiti will face them. I have demanded 
and have obtained the provisional government's word that it will 
take all measures to ensure our survival as an independent and 
fully sovereign nation. Thus, a state of emergency is declared. 
A series of government measures will go into effect immediately. 
I order the Haitian Armed Forces commander in chief to guard 
against all possibilities. 
  Haitians who have forgotten their patriotic duty and have 
joined with foreigners to demand the invasion and occupation of 
our sacred land, again enslaving the Haitian people, further 
adds to the excessiveness of our tragedy. I feel sorry for them. 
I ask you to overcome this painful treason. Haiti cannot and 
must not die. Tonight, I ask you to preserve the heroic legacy 
of Toussaint Louverture, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, and Alexandre 
Petion. I ask you to move proudly toward this period of 
resistance, the royal path carved by our ancestors. Together, 
may we write this new chapter, surpassing ourselves with renewed 
dignity and the celebrated unity of all social forces in this 
country! 
  May it be said that the men and women of this country will 
fervently relight the torch of resistance to foreign invaders 
and unflinchingly undergo the constraints of this time of 
struggle and heroic uprising [marronnage heroique]! May it be 
said simply that we have greater commitment to our 
responsibilities and the requirements of our time! In these 
tragic moments of the national life, I ask you to keep cool and 
to attend to your daily affairs as usual. On the other hand, it 
is the responsibility of all of us to remain mobilized and 
vigilance for the sake of unity and determination, like the 
ancestors, to struggle to the death in ensuring the country's 
defense before the enemies. 
  From now on, may each man and woman in this country take 
responsibility for the endangered fatherland. The honor of a 
country cannot be divided. Enlightened by the shades of our 
ancestors, enlivened by the sources of our beliefs, mobilizing 
all the resources of our ancestral strategies, we again find ... 
[pauses] we will reclaim the dignified legacy of the illustrious 
runaways, the obscure blacksmith of our freedom. 
  On behalf of the Haitian nation, I thank all those nations 
that have refused to give in to the immorality, the arrogance, 
and the perfidy of a certain international community, to those 
that have relieved us of our misfortunes. May God and the 
protecting gods of the homeland help us in our quest to go 
beyond ourselves. Courage! We will manage to reach that together. 
  Haitian men and women, I am obliged to appear before 
you today to say a few words as the country is in danger. We 
have been aware of the propaganda against us for a long time, 
but today it is worse. A giant that can destroy us in five 
minutes because we are weak and do not have atomic bombs has 
declared war on us even though we have done nothing against it. 
Why? I have heard it is because they want to restore democracy 
in this country. Where was that democracy? I never knew about 
that democracy. 
  During the 1990 elections, I was a State Council 
member. I also took the candidate for whom everybody was voting 
seriously, and voted for him myself. Today, I am obliged to say 
that. But I am ashamed of having voted for him because today, a 
Haitian [Aristide] who was always referring to Charlemagne 
Peralte, Dessalines, and so on, and who was always criticizing 
those with whom he is today cohabiting, is imploring those 
people to come and invade Haiti, to reduce us to slavery. 
  Everyone has the right to vote for the one they want. I 
too voted for the person I wanted. But I do not think that any 
Haitian can accept another Haitian asking that Haiti be reduced 
to slavery. It is not possible. This is why we say no, this is 
impossible. I remember the words General Henri Christophe said 
when Gen. Leclerc appeared in the Cap-Haitian harbor. 
Leclerc asked Christophe to lay down weapons, but Christophe 
replied as follows: You will enter Cap-Haitien after all 
cities... [pauses] after the whole country is burnt, and I will 
still be fighting you even on the ruins. A Haitian Army officer 
said the same thing recently. Well, today, I repeat it as well. 
We cannot give in to anyone. We acknowledge that Haiti is weak 
and that we cannot fight against giants because we do not have 
atomic bombs that we could drop on their countries. If they knew 
we had atomic bombs, they would all respect us. But today, they 
have dropped in on us. They want to come and destroy us, to 
reduce us again to slavery. Why? We do not know. For democracy? 
Was there ever any democracy? 
When it was asked to burn people with tires, I was 
ashamed. I never knew Haitians could reach that level of 
savagery. I always knew Haitians as docile people who loved 
everyone, loved one another. They [not further identified] make 
them hate one another now. That is no longer possible. Today, we 
are tired of that. I believe we must all unite because we cannot 
return to slavery. That is not possible. And those who want to 
make us return to slavery, they themselves should come here. 
They do not know what kind of negroes they are dealing with. 
  Several foreign journalists came to question me lately. 
I told them Haiti does not have the atomic bomb, but Haiti has 
better than that. Haiti has guardians they do not know, and the 
day the guardians intervene, get involved, then everyone will 
ask where they had been, where they came from, who they are. The 
foreign journalists came to ask me, and I told them that. Many 
people will be surprised. Many cities may disappear, and no one 
will understand. They think anyone can do whatever he pleases in 
Haiti. That is not true. We all know that, and you all 
understand very well what I am telling you. 
  Everyone who is able must help. And I know that 
everyone will help. We will see what will happen. We cannot bend 
before the enemy. We cannot let them destroy us. They can reduce 
us to ashes in a few minutes, as I told you. We do not have the 
means to defend ourselves. We do not have enough weapons. We are 
a small goat before a lion. They can devour us in a moment. But, 
only if God wishes it. We know the word: (Agarou) says, if God 
wishes it! 
  The people, the Haitians who ask that we be invaded, 
what are they themselves doing abroad? For two and a half years, 
they have been wasting the country's money, giving it to white 
Americans while we Haitians are dying of hunger. They did not do 
anything for us. The Taiwanese Government gave them U.S. $2 
million. How much did they give us? We all know who benefited 
from that money. We did not receive anything. We did not get 
even a gourde. Therefore, I do not think today that we can stand 
up and let foreigners invade us because of a criminal who burns 
people. I do not know where he got all the bad things that he 
carries in him. He chose the wrong road. We cannot follow him on 
the road he has chosen. We have chosen the right road because we 
know that we do not make many of the things happen that happen. 
We are not alone on this earth and every Haitian knows that. 
  Once there was an OAS director general who visited 
Haiti. I believe his name was (Alejandro Ofila). He paid a visit 
to one of the big newspapers in Haiti. As he was leaving, he 
told the director [as heard]: They say, Director, that your 
country is poor. But what amazes me in Haiti is the human warmth 
and spirituality in all Haitians. Haitians have something in 
their eyes that no other people have. This is someone who had 
traveled around the world. I believe that what he said is true. 
I wrote something in French at that time. I said: Honor to this 
great man who knew how to look at us, not with physical eyes, 
but with the eyes of the spirit because the spirit sees farther 
than physical eyes, which are nothing. The physical body is 
nothing. It can be destroyed. But no one can destroy spirit. 
That is all I wanted to tell you. I believe we will all unite to 
defend the country. Toussaint Louverture, Dessalines, 
Christophe, Petion, Capois-la-Mort said no, this cannot be done. 
Today, we are obliged to say the same thing. We know they can 
destroy us. We do not have enough weapons to defend ourselves. 
But, we have possibilities that they do not know. They may face 
misfortune. Only God knows! 
  I will not stay too long because I know that you need 
many things. At one time, that government was trying to help 
you, but now they are talking to us about invasion. They are 
going to invade us. Why? What did we do to the white men? 
Nothing. Haitians did not do anything to the white men. 
  To restore democracy in the country. Was there 
democracy in Haiti? Has democracy ever existed in Haiti? I do 
not know what the foreigners call democracy. Perhaps, they have 
democracy in their country. Yet, in their country, negroes do 
not have rights. It is only now that negroes, more or less, have 
rights in their country. Then, what does that mean? So now they 
can defend negroes -- to bring the little negro [Aristide] back 
to Haiti. Why does this little negro not come by himself? If he 
is really strong, why does he not come? He has given all the 
money he is spending to Americans. He has given millions of 
Haiti's money, which was saved abroad, to one American. 
  Do foreigners have the right to do that? This is a 
crime they have committed against us because we are weak. They 
have taken advantage of us. But they do not know that they will 
not endure for long because of that. Look and you will see that 
what I say will happen. They think Haitians are a little thing. 
Yes, Haitians are nothing. But all Haitians have behind them a 
lot of things that they do not know about. They will realize 
this before long. 
  All those who harmed Haiti have succumbed. There is a 
certain president who is now in jail for theft. He was leading 
the group who were saying that Haiti should be destroyed. Where 
is he? He is in prison for theft, for a bad cause. Others have 
fallen; others will fall. They even have many problems in their 
own countries. We must know that, too. They see fleas on us 
because we are thin dogs while they have big ticks walking on 
them in their country. They are not serious, they are not more 
serious than we are. Then, it is only that I was telling you. I 
ask all of you to unite, to remain mobilized in order to defend 
the country. 
  If they destroy us, we will all die together. Haitians 
never fear death. I (?remember) when I went to take the oath at 
parliament, I saw the Independence Act. It began: Freedom or 
death. Haitians can no longer live in slavery. Either we die, or 
we remain free. But they will cool before long, you will see, 
and I say thanks to you.

Monday in June. The opening of the eighth session of the 45th 
Legislature will begin without ceremony, however, according to 
Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, who cites the situation of insecurity 
to explain the impossibility of holding a session in parliament 
today [13 June].

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jun (EFE) -- The de facto 
government of Emile Jonassaint issued a statement today, 
although it is dated Saturday [11 June] and was released a few 
hours after the declaration of the state of emergency throughout 
the country, that it guarantees the security of foreign citizens 
in Haiti. 
  The Information Ministry asked foreigners to carry out their 
normal activities. At the same time, the de facto government 
rejected statements by the international civilian mission of the 
United Nations and the OAS, which charged that employees of the 
international mission were attacked by armed civilians on 7 June.

  [Text] A political organization, Revolutionary Cohort has 
set down some conditions for defending the national territory in 
case of foreign invasion. Moreover, the organization's 
spokesman, Wesner Morency, recommends the resignation of the 
Army commander in chief and the formation of a national 
coalition government with a prime minister. 
  [Begin recording, in Creole] [Morency] Whatever the 
situation 
that makes this person or that person chief, we are now on 
alert. Whether I am for or against, if bullets begin pouring 
down on my roof, I must counterattack. Self-defense, however, 
requires unity of command and morality within the command. Can 
we in the Revolutionary Cohort afford to create a wait-and-see 
policy, with those men later dragging us through the mud and 
drowning us underwater. For me to respond to this state of 
emergency, I must set down some conditions. 
  The first condition is to replace Cedras. It is a fact that 
he cannot command a battle, as the president has asked him to 
do. The president said: I ordered... 
  We are also saying that we must dismiss this government. 
This 
government does not represent anything. There are many trends 
within the country and they must be respected, whether they are 
majority or minority, so establish a national coalition 
government with a prime minister. 
  The third element is since he, Jonassaint, is talking about 
stateless people, mercenaries, we say no. The Haitian state uses 
three means of mass communication: newspaper, television, and 
radio. You have problems with mercenaries and stateless people, 
but they are competent. You must recognize that they are 
competent. It is necessary to oppose competence with competence, 
not with mediocrity. 
  [Reporter Renois] Does the president of the country, in the 
face of a threat of intervention -- as you said it, whether you 
like him or not -- not have a duty to call for mobilization and 
unity? 
  [Morency] He has the duty. But once he does it, the person 
he 
is fighting will say, here are my conditions. It is his duty. 
But once he does his duty, I must do my duty as well. My duty is 
to tell him: You want it. You are doing it. Here are my 
conditions for it to succeed. [end recording]

<F P=106> [By Edwige Balutansky] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Representatives 
of international organizations in Haiti reported here today 
attacks on their personnel by members of the Revolutionary Front 
for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti (FRAPH). 
  The officials of these organizations told the media that 
they 
do not want to travel in the official vehicles of their 
organizations because the FRAPH violently confiscates them. It 
was learned last week that customs personnel at the Haitian 
international airport confiscated, without apparent reason, 
bulletproof vests and uniforms from members of the U.S. Marine 
Corps. 
  Regarding the topic, the (?mysterious) confiscation of 
communications material and defense weapons was made by regular 
military forces and not by "armed civilians as the alleged 
civilian mission affirms." "This material has been confiscated 
because it was not registered anywhere," the communique stated. 
  This weekend, two individuals who identified themselves as 
FRAPH members violently seized an official vehicle from a 
64-year-old driver. The FRAPH is a paramilitary group linked to 
the Haitian Army. It has been identified by the OAS-UN Civilian 
Mission and international organizations as responsible for the 
violence and the repression of popular organizations and 
supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
  Meanwhile, airplane tickets for flights through 25 June have 
sold out. That is the date when the United States will suspend 
its commercial flights to Haiti. Air Canada has already 
canceled its flights effective this Monday and announced it will 
make a special flight on Wednesday in response to the Canadian 
Embassy's recommendation to Canadians to leave the country 
before 25 June. 
  Political observers have expressed surprise that the price 
of 
gasoline has dropped at a time when it is said the border with 
the Dominican Republic is closed to prevent the entry of fuel. 
Gasoline vendors in Port-au-Prince explained to Radio Tropic 
that they have no difficulties obtaining the fuel because it is 
brought across the border at night when there is no surveillance.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 13 Jun (AFP) -- Official sources in 
Port-au-Prince today announced that the Vatican signed an aid 
agreement with the government of President Emile Jonassaint (not 
recognized internationally). The Haitian Ministry of 
Information reported that the agreement, signed on 27 May in 
Italy by the Holy See and representatives of the acting Haitian 
Government, establishes that the Holy See will deliver 75,000 
tons of wheat worth $32 million. A communique issued by the 
Ministry of Information states that "the acting president 
(Jonassaint), on behalf of the people of Haiti, who have been 
subjected to a criminal and unjustified blockade, thanks the 
Vatican and Pope John Paul II for their understanding and 
growing concern." 
  According to diplomatic sources in Port-au-Prince, this 
agreement recognizes the Haitian regime, installed following a 
coup d'etat that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a 
priest, on 30 September 1990. The Vatican approved the removal 
of Father Aristide from the Salesian Order shortly before he 
assumed office "for inciting violence and class struggle." In 
1992, the Vatican recognized Joseph Nerette's acting government 
(without international recognition). 
  The Haitian clergy is experiencing serious division between 
its hierarchy and some of its rank and file, who are members of 
the "Ti Iglesia" and faithful to Aristide. On 7 January 1991, 
during a foiled coup attempt led by former "Tonton Macoute" 
leader Roger Lafontant, alleged followers of Aristide burned the 
Apostolic Nunciature and humiliated the nuncio. 
  The Catholic Church hierarchy in Haiti has issued periodic 
condemnations of the embargo decreed to force Haiti to return 
Aristide to power because it believes the sanctions represent 
much suffering for the Haitian people.

<F P=106> [From the "Up-to-Date" newscast] </F>
  [Text] When the Legislative Assembly approved the decree 
whereby compensation for demobilized Army troops was 
established, it only included field personnel or, in other 
words, former soldiers. The Association of Demobilized Armed 
Forces Members [Adefaes], however, requested and succeeded in 
having the decree reformed to include military hospital 
personnel. 
  Now, for the third time, they are requesting another reform 
to include administrative personnel who were dismissed due to 
the peace agreements. An unidentified Adefaes spokesman 
addressed the issue. 
  [Begin unidentified Adefaes spokesman recording] We were not 
consulted on the decree that was passed, and it is incomplete 
because it deprives a great many people of compensation 
benefits. Our concern is that all the people who have been left 
out are entitled to benefits. [end recording] 
  Adefaes expects a positive response to its petition from the 
Legislative Assembly. Otherwise, its unidentified spokesman 
said, it will exert pressure. 
  [Begin unidentified spokesman recording] There may be some 
violence. If they do not meet our demands we will have no other 
alternative. We will gradually intensify our efforts and, I 
repeat, the time bomb may explode. [end recording] 
  On this occasion everything seems to indicate that Adefaes' 
request will be resolved in its favor because the two largest 
factions in the Assembly support the petition. 
  [Begin recording] [First unidentified deputy] Directly or 
indirectly, whether they were on the battlefield or they held 
administrative positions at garrisons, these people were 
involved in the conflict and they served the Armed Forces. I 
believe their request is fair. 
  [Second unidentified deputy] They requested a reform to 
include military hospital nurses. I do not believe that 
administrative personnel should be left out either. [end 
recording] 
  Another group requiring immediate attention are soldiers 
maimed in the war. According to Deputy Carranza, efforts are 
being made to establish a fund for the war maimed, which would 
be included in next year's extraordinary budget.

<F P=106> ["Excerpts" of "exclusive interview" with General Humberto </F>
Ortega, commander in chief of the Sandinist People's Army, by 
Luis Arturo Alvarez; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [Alvarez] Following the special congress held last 
week, there are rumors of division within the FSLN [Sandinist 
National Liberation Front]. In your opinion, what were the 
results of the congress? 
  [Ortega] Considering that the FSLN is the nation's largest 
party, I believe the greatest result was that the congress ended 
without the party being divided. Nevertheless, Sandinism has 
not completely escaped the great political, economic, and social 
polarization effecting all social strata of the nation. 
  [Alvarez] Many say that Sandinism still has not managed to 
find its identity. It seems unable to adapt to its role as an 
opposition party and does not find a definite ideological 
course. Where is the FSLN really headed? 
  [Ortega] The FSLN, as well as all parties in Nicaragua, must 
face the future to adjust to current world demands, which means 
analyzing reality by casting aside all those rigid ideological 
schemes and orthodox leanings. 
  [Alvarez] But is not just the opposite happening through a 
strong orthodox hegemony following the last Sandinist Congress? 
  [Ortega] I know Sandinism very well, and I can tell you that 
both opposing currents have among their membership 
representatives from both trends. Neither side is very rigid or 
defined. 
  In this sense there are more or less two orthodox points of 
view, but what is most important is not that heretics should 
become Christians or that Christians become heretics. It is 
important that both heretics and Christians agree with what is 
best for the country. 
  [Alvarez] To what degree will the Sandinist electoral future 
be affected, especially in light of the 1996 elections, taking 
into account its growing polarization? 
  [Ortega] To my way of thinking, the problem is not winning 
the 1996 elections. Why does a party want to win the elections 
if it is going to rule amid greater poverty, more disaster, and 
if there is no true way out and no true consensus? This country 
is going to be ungovernable. What is truly needed is that 
whoever wins should structure a government of true national 
unity. 
  [Alvarez] What role will you play within the FSLN once you 
leave the Army next year? 
  [Alvarez] No, I will not rejoin the FSLN. I believe I 
already played an historic role in the party. I am now playing 
another historic role as the head of a handful of revolutionary 
men like myself. We are giving Nicaragua an Army totally 
unconnected with the FSLN or any other political force. 
  I will dedicate myself to a very special activity by 
contributing to bring Nicaraguans closer through my experience, 
my point of view, and the degree of authority I have. I will 
not return to the FSLN, but I will always be a Sandinist. I 
have been making a concerted effort with Pablo Antonio Cuadra, 
an outstanding conservative intellectual, and with Cardinal 
Miguel Obando y Bravo. For six months, we have been working 
together to seek concrete solutions to specific problems. 
  [Alvarez] If representatives from various groups reach a 
consensus on this project to seek national conciliation, would 
you be willing to lead a new political group? 
  [Ortega] The core of the matter is that the nation's most 
important forces must reach a basic agreement, because, if the 
current situation continues, the big winner in the 1996 
elections will be absenteeism and frustration. 
  The creation of a movement is feasible when several existing 
parties and other leaders who do not belong to any party can be 
incorporated. I do not want to spearhead this movement, but I 
would like to take part in it. We will see whether in this 
effort there is a need for some to go one way and others the 
other way, and if one has the desire to participate in this. 
  [Alvarez] In your eagerness to seek political consensus, 
could the FSLN pass you a bill for your flexible position with 
Violeta Chamorro's government? 
  [Ortega] I already have paid a political price with regard 
to 
the militant Sandinist sector. Nevertheless, I did what I had 
to do, and I have received the approval of many other citizens. 
I am convinced that it is even more important to save Nicaragua 
than to save the FSLN. The people now understand that 
polarized, confronted, or divided, all we produce is poverty. 
  [Alvarez] It is no secret that you and your brother Daniel 
Ortega currently have very large differences in your political 
concepts. To what do you attribute this distancing between the 
two of you? 
  [Ortega] I am currently in a very difficult situation, 
because I have against me the Sandinist leaders of the two 
political currents. I am criticized because a process of 
hegemonism still prevails, and maybe the moderates believe that 
I can compete with them in this area. On the other side of the 
fence, they know that by my leaving the Army before the 
elections I might compete for the FSLN party leadership. 
  [Alvarez] Could we say that the differences between you and 
Daniel Ortega boil down to fact that he wants to maintain the 
party leadership at all costs? 
  [Ortega] Every leader undoubtedly wants to be in control of 
his movement. It has fallen upon Daniel to lead the most needy 
sectors. By working and sharing every day with the most 
resentful groups -- people who expected greater benefits from 
the government and yet did not obtain them -- his feelings have 
hardened. He cannot exercise his leadership through 
conciliatory positions, because the people who have fallen into 
despair because of their economic situation do not understand 
any other position. I, however, am playing the institutional 
role. I am seeking to leave the nation's Army removed from any 
political party. 
  [Alvarez] You now speak of conciliatory positions, but your 
refusal to leave the Army was one of the causes that produced 
greater confrontation and instability in Nicaragua. How can you 
explain this? 
  [Ortega] What is most important here is that we reached an 
agreement with Violeta Chamorro's government, and we are all 
happy to have reached a consensus on this issue. 
  [Alvarez] But, could this have been reached earlier, thereby 
avoiding confrontation? 
  [Ortega] The problem is that this matter cannot be assessed 
in terms of individuals. I could not leave without having the 
Military Law approved. I have played a leading role in the 
Army, considering the lack of a more specific law. If the 
Military Law's approval is obtained at the Legislative Assembly, 
the Army will not function so much in terms of individuals. 
Instead, it will be ruled on institutional grounds. 
  I could not leave under the conditions that prevailed last 
year, because I was not ready at that time, and also because I 
was subjected to a series of events that were not the most 
tasteful. 
  [Alvarez] Do you believe that Major General Joaquin Cuadra, 
who has been mentioned as your possible successor, will continue 
the work you initiated in the Army as you have planned it? 
  [Ortega] I believe he can, because it is not a matter of 
placing one man in charge of this task. No matter who is at the 
helm, he will continue the work within an institutional 
framework and within a very specific timeframe -- that is, five 
years. It is no longer a matter that he be another Humberto 
Ortega. Instead, he will sail on another course.

<F P=106> [Report by Alexandra Ballestas from the "RPC Television </F>
News" newscast] 
  [Text] Captain Jose Delgado, the deputy director of the 
General Consular and Ships Directorate, reported to RPC that 
Panama has the largest merchant marine fleet in the world 
because it offers many facilities. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] Panama occupied second place for a 
long time. However, due to our aggressive policy, Panama was 
able to take first place from Liberia in June 1993. [end 
recording] 
  Capt. Delgado explained that the flagging of ships dropped 
considerably when Panama suffered its economic crisis in 1989. 
  [Begin Delgado recording] We lost a bit less than 2 million 
tons during the crisis. Immediately thereafter, in 1990, 
however, we started an aggressive program and visited the main 
ship owners, participated in the main international maritime 
events, and more importantly, attended events at the 
International Maritime Organization. This organization is 
seated in London, and all the international maritime agreements 
and norms are debated there. Our program prompted ship owners 
to regain confidence in us, and they have given us their 
support. [end recording] 
  The principal countries that request Panamanian flagging are 
Japan, Greece, Hong Kong, and Korea.

<F P=106> [Report by Ciro Ortega from the "RPC Television News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The issue of the budget cutbacks, which will 
negatively affect all government institutions, is being studied 
at the Palace of the Herons for the second consecutive day. A 
special cabinet meeting to continue discussing the issue was 
held this afternoon. Planning Minister Delia Cardenas said she 
thought the situation was not so grim. 
  [Begin Cardenas recording] It amounts to a $198-million 
budget cutback. This, however, is not a Greek tragedy. Do 
recall that I told you we had invested $409 million last year 
and the we still have $412 million. I hope the $412 million is 
invested as budgeted. [end recording] 
  Delia Cardenas reported that every minister and his economic 
analysts have evaluated the priorities in their work programs 
and that the cutbacks would be made where they caused the least 
damage to national interests. The special cabinet meeting is 
basically studying the programs to be suspended and will approve 
or disapprove them. Cardenas added that the National Economic 
Council will meet with the National Assembly Budget Commission 
members next week to evaluate the situation. 
  Education Minister Marco Alarcon commented on the situation 
and said that several education programs will be negatively 
affected by this action: 
  [Begin Alarcon recording] The [Education Ministry] cutback 
will amount to approximately $7.5 million and will have a very 
negative impact on the entire education sector. We will be 
unable to meet the demands for new classrooms. The computer 
education program will have to be brought to an almost complete 
standstill and will not advance at the speed we wanted it to, 
and we will not -- this is very important -- be able to repair 
and maintain existing schools. Also, it will be very difficult 
for us to cover the school furniture deficit. [end recording] 
  The budget cutbacks are the result of loan curtailments by 
the International Financial Institutions. Those organizations 
will implement this measure because Panama did not comply with 
several conditions for the loans, such as the approval of laws 
to deal with electricity pilfering at the IRHE [Institute of 
Hydraulic Resources and Electrification], the elimination of 
special retirements, the implementation of the privatization 
process, and the reduction of government payrolls, among others. 
  As they arrived at the Palace of the Herons, all the 
ministers pointed out that, although the budget cutbacks will 
limit the government's projections, they will not be so decisive 
that they tarnish the work carried out by the Endara 
administration.

  [Excerpt] The city of Cordoba was virtually paralyzed at 
1000 yesterday. More than 10,000 workers took to the streets to 
participate in the largest labor rally in the past decade. The 
movement was headed by the so-called Movement for Union 
Organization and Action. Workers are protesting over the 
national economic policy and demanding a general salary increase 
in the province. The column marched through the downtown area 
surrounded by 1,000 police agents. There were no serious 
incidents, but noise bombs detonated by demonstrators did 
destroy one shop window. Governor Eduardo Angeloz admitted "the 
legitimacy of the workers' claims." He said: "Their protest and 
claims are reasonable, but regrettably I cannot satisfy their 
demands because the economic situation does not allow me to do 
so." 
  Some 88 labor organizations participated in the march. Even 
the police supported it, promising to carry out only "preventive 
activities for demonstrators security." The schedule called for 
the workers to leave their place of work at 1000 and gather on 
the corner of Colon and General Paz Streets in downtown Cordoba. 
The first groups to arrive were road workers and post office 
workers. They were followed by court employees and civil 
servants. Sanitary workers and teachers, the most numerous 
group, joined them shortly afterward. Representatives of the 80 
unions arrived around noon. President Menem's administration and 
Eduardo Angeloz' government were the main topic of the protest 
songs. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- Defense Minister 
Oscar Camilion today indicated that "some figures must still be 
adjusted" to carry out President Carlos Menem's order to 
eliminate compulsory military service. Camilion noted that it 
must still be determined whether the new system "can be 
implemented overnight, or whether it requires a process of 
adjustment." 
  Camilion agreed with Lieutenant General Martin Balza, Army 
chief of staff, that "no deadline" has been established for 
carrying out the presidential order. 
  Justicialist Party and Radical Civic Union Party legislators 
this afternoon supported the president's decision to eliminate 
compulsory military service, and stressed that this measure "has 
been requested extensively by the whole of Argentine society." 
  A little over two months ago, the public became engaged in 
heavy discussions over whether or not it was appropriate to 
maintain the system of compulsory military service, after the 
killing of conscript Omar Carrasco at a garrison in the town of 
Zapala, Neuquen Province. 
  Congress became a sounding board for this controversial 
issue, as a military service bill that has already been approved 
by the Chamber of Deputies is currently being reviewed by the 
Senate Defense Committee. 
  The defense minister made it clear that the decision was 
made 
by the executive branch, "but Congress will have the last word 
in determining a way to replace compulsory military service with 
a professional system." 
  Concerning the deadlines considered by the government for 
implementing the measure, the minister pointed out that "there 
are no deadlines," but estimated that "a few weeks will be 
required." 
  The defense minister indicated that the project "was 
discussed by the cabinet today, and the president believed it 
was wise and advisable to announce it publicly." 
  Concerning the budget issue, Camilion said: "In principle it 
is being reviewed, to see if the idea is viable." He added: 
"The figures must still be adjusted." 
  The minister also explained that "no deadlines have been 
estimated" for the elimination of compulsory military service, 
because it is very important to determine first "whether it can 
be implemented overnight or whether it requires an adjustment 
process." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa Serrano on 
8 June did not rule out the possibility of his country 
ultimately asking for arbitration on the Continental Glaciers 
issue if the bilateral agreement on the Continental Glaciers 
remains frozen in the Argentine Congress (its approval has been 
pending for two years). 
  Figueroa noted that during his official visit to Argentina 
he 
reviewed this sensitive issue with his Argentine counterpart, 
Guido Di Tella, on 8 June and both arrived at the following 
conclusion: "We, the governments, already have done our part." 
The foreign ministers now believe it all depends on the 
Congresses. 
  When CLARIN asked him if his remarks meant that he ruled out 
the possibility of resorting to arbitration, as established in 
the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, Figueroa -- visibly 
annoyed -- responded: "I did not say that, but we do not rule 
out any possible solution ... all possibilities remain open." 
  During a news conference at the National Foreign Service 
Institute [ISEN], Figueroa, who was joined by Di Tella, 
Argentine Ambassador to Chile Eduardo Iglesias, and Chilean 
Ambassador to Argentina Eduardo Rodriguez, stressed that the 
Argentine Government does not believe Chile would ultimately ask 
for arbitration as compensation for a possible adverse ruling in 
the Laguna del Desierto arbitration. 
  This possibility had been discussed at ISEN by Foreign 
Ministry Secretary General Andres Cisneros and prompted an 
information request by Peronist Santa Cruz Deputy Rafael Flores, 
one of the rebels preventing the discussion of the Continental 
Glaciers agreement. 
  Without citing any names, Figueroa noted: "There cannot be 
any other official message from the Argentine Government but the 
one voiced by Di Tella." 
  High-ranking Foreign Ministry officials speculate that after 
November, when the arbitration court will issue a ruling on the 
Laguna del Desierto case surely favoring the Argentine position, 
Chile reportedly will seek arbitration on the Continental 
Glaciers to compensate for this possible diplomatic defeat.

  [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- It has been 
officially announced that the Italian Embassy in Argentina on 10 
June submitted to Foreign Vice Minister Fernando Petrella an 
official request for the extradition of former Nazi officer 
Erich Priebke, who is charged with participating in the murder 
of 335 Italians during World War II. 
  The Foreign Ministry also announced that Foreign Minister 
Guido Di Tella immediately ordered that the request be sent to 
the federal court in Bariloche City, which is presided over by 
Judge Leonidas Moldes, who is hearing the case involving 
Priebke's arrest. 
  The Foreign Ministry official communique states that the 
extradition request was submitted to Petrella by Italian 
Ambassador to Argentina Giuseppe Maria Borga. 
  It was unofficially reported on 8 June that Italian 
authorities would officially file for the extradition of Priebke 
on 10 June. 
  The Foreign Ministry communique adds that the request was 
checked against the current extradition treaty between Italy and 
Argentina and then mailed to Judge Moldes "following the 
participation of Interpol and a Foreign Ministry official." 
[passage omitted] 
  Discussions will now surely ensue about deadlines for 
meeting 
the request. 
  Priebke's attorney, Pedro Bianchi, believes "at least two 
years" will pass before his defendant's extradition will be 
approved. Bianchi said he has no objection to "the charges on 
which the extradition request is filed," but added that there 
are "some mistakes in the resolution" signed by Italian Justice 
Minister Alfredo Biondi. 
  Ruben Beraja, head of the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish 
Associations (DAIA), said: "There is concern at all government 
levels, including the courts, over resolving this case within a 
reasonable time." 
  [Italian Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi's new 
administration responded immediately to Priebke's remarks, when 
Liliana Ferrero, Justice Ministry Criminal Affairs secretary, 
announced that her government would request Priebke's 
extradition.

  [Text] San Miguel de Tucuman, 11 Jun (NA) -- It has been 
officially reported in this city that an alleged member of the 
Peruvian Maoist organization Shining Path was arrested during a 
joint Federal and Tucuman Police operation. The alleged 
terrorist, identified as Jorge Diaz Reategui, was captured at a 
hotel in the poor district of El Bajo, near the city bus 
terminal. At the time of his capture, Reategui was with other 
alleged guerrillas, who managed to escape. 
  Judge Ricardo Maturana is in charge of Federal Court No. 2 
of 
this city. On 10 June he questioned Reategui, but the details 
of the questioning have not been released. 
  Police sources have said Reategui had been under very strict 
surveillance by the Federal Police. 
  It has been suggested that this province is a refugee camp 
for Shining Path members who clandestinely cross the border and 
train Peruvian and Argentine militants who support their 
ideology.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jun (NA) -- It was officially 
announced here that the Argentine Navy corvette "Parker" has 
captured the Taiwanese fishing trawler "Man Wei III" which was 
operating without a permit inside the Exclusive Economic Zone. 
The seizure occurred 199 miles east of Cabo Blanco, off Santa 
Cruz Province, where the Navy detected the "potero," which is 
how squid fishing boats are known here. The Taiwanese boat 
obeyed the order to stop and was boarded by a Navy Visiting and 
Registering contingent. 
  The Argentine Navy released a communique saying that the 
"Man 
Wei III" did not have a permit. On deck, in the hold, and in 
the tunnels [as received] were several metric tons of fresh 
squid. 
  A recent resolution issued by the Agriculture, Livestock and 
Fishing Secretariat forbids the fishing of squid south of 
Parallel 43 30'. 
  The "Parker" is escorting the Taiwanese fishing boat to Port 
Madryn where it will arrive on the night of 12 June. The 
appropriate authorities will then take over the investigation.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 9 
June. 
  Argentina's balance of trade for the first four months of 
1994 produced a deficit of $2.4 billion, 380 percent greater 
than the deficit in the same period last year, according to 
Indec, the Institute of Statistics and Census. The figures 
published yesterday show that April's deficit was $556 million, 
which is slightly less than the deficits of $714 million, $525 
million, and $609 million in January, February, and March 
respectively. 
  Meanwhile, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said yesterday 
that the deficit wasn't worrisome, as one has to consider the 
`vigorous investments being carried out and the growth that this 
brings.' Cavallo said, however, that the deficit `will give rise 
to a lot of pressure from many sectors to restrict imports,' 
although he made it clear that the government would not go back 
on its liberalization policies. 
  On the positive side, the Indec statistics also show that 
activity levels are growing, the investment rate is up, the 
consumption rate is down, and the national savings rate is 
increasing. The figures also show that the export of 
manufactured goods is increasing. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES 
HERALD in English 7 Jun 94 p 7) 
  According to data supplied by Indec, the trade balance 
deficit since April 1991, when the convertibility program was 
launched, amounts to some $5 billion. Between January and 
December 1991 a trade balance surplus of 3.7024 billion pesos 
was achieved; for the April to December 1991 period the surplus 
was 2.655 billion pesos. The trade balance deficit for 1992 was 
2.8735 billion pesos; in 1993 3.6658 billion pesos; and 1.1133 
billion pesos during the first two months of 1994. (Buenos 
Aires LA PRENSA in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 6) 
  Inflation in May was 0.3 percent, bringing the annual rate 
for the year ending May 31 to 3.4 percent, the Indec census 
bureau said yesterday. Inflation last month was due mainly to 
the 4.5 percent rise in electricity and gas prices, which had a 
strong influence on the final figure. Prices have risen 0.8 
percent so far in 1994. 
  According to the same statistics, wholesale prices in May 
went up by 0.6 percent, while construction costs were up by 0.3 
percent. 
  As to retail prices, housing costs increased by 1.6 percent 
while health costs were up 0.8 percent, a rise caused mainly by 
the 1 percent rise in the cost of medicines. The price of 
housing equipment was up 0.6 percent, clothing was up by 0.5 
percent, education 0.3 percent, and general goods and 
communications rose by 0.1 percent. 
  The cost of food and beverages, which are usually a large 
part of a family's expenditure, were unchanged from the previous 
month, although the prices of some products went up: oranges up 
10.6 percent, bananas up 4.2 percent, fresh cheese up 3.8 
percent, and eggs up 3.4 percent. These were offset by a drop 
of 0.5 percent in meat prices. 
  After 38 months of convertibility, prices have gone up 
generally by 54.2 percent. (Buenos Aires BUENOS AIRES HERALD in 
English 4 Jun 94 p 7) 
  A group of Petroleum Industry Chamber, CIP, entrepreneurs 
today informed President Carlos Menem that global petroleum 
industry investments in Argentina would total more than $15 
billion through the year 2000. CIP President Jorge Brea 
indicated: "Investments totaled $1.1 billion per year between 
1986 and 1990. Investments will total $2.1 billion per year 
between 1991 and 1995, and $2.3 billion per year between 1996 
and the year 2000." Brea also told Menem that following 
deregulation, crude oil production in Argentina grew from 28 
million cubic meters in 1990 to a record 34.6 million cubic 
meters in 1993. Brea said that this year's projections for 
crude oil production total 38 million cubic meters. (Buenos 
Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1727 GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  The Economic Programming Secretariat today reported that 
gross fixed domestic investments grew 34 percent during the 
first quarter, as compared with 1993. Tractor sales and capital 
goods accounted for the largest growth rates. (Buenos Aires 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 2249 GMT 6 Jun 94) 
  YPF, Government Oil Deposits, has reported that oil 
production grew 11.79 percent during the first quarter, totaling 
12,012,748 cubic meters. Oil production totaled 10,745,531 
cubic meters during the first quarter of 1993. (Buenos Aires LA 
PRENSA in Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 5) 
  President Carlos Menem this morning signed a decree 
approving 
the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota's plans to establish 
production in this country. Toyota will invest about $150 
million here, and will employ some 800 people. (Buenos Aires 
NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish 1343 GMT 8 Jun 94)

  [Text] Oscar Salas has been reelected to the post of 
executive secretary of the Bolivian Labor Federation [COB]. 
Julio Roca Laguna reports on the 10th COB congress from Tarija: 
  [Begin recording] [Roca] Up to now five of the seven 
commissions that have been established have submitted their 
reports to the 10th ordinary congress of the COB being held in 
Tarija. The Political and Organization Affairs Commissions have 
yet to submit their reports. The latter report is drawing more 
attention because it centers on the COB reorganization. 
  Moreover, the Economic Affairs Commission has made the 
following recommendations: the safeguarding of properties of 
state-owned companies and the reactivation of mines; the 
issuance of a statement against the privatization of the 
National Road Service; the disbursement of $7 million to build 
the Jaime Mendoza highway. 
  In its report, the Peasant and Agricultural Affairs 
Commission repudiates the concentration of land in the hands of 
a few and calls for a halt to the plundering of Bolivian forests 
and jungles. Regarding the coca leaf issue, the commission 
disavows Law 1008 because it is unconstitutional and demands the 
repeal of Article No. 2 of the coca industrialization decree. 
[end recording] 
  According to the FIDES news agency, the 10th COB congress 
closed before dawn today with the election of a [word 
indistinct] fifth executive committee. The report states that 
Oscar Salas Moya has been reelected as COB executive secretary. 
Salas is a member of the ASD [Democratic Socialism Alternative]. 
Juan Chavez, a factory workers' union representative and member 
of Conscience of the Fatherland Party, was elected first 
secretary general. Juan de la Cruz Villca, a peasant group 
representative, was elected second secretary general. They were 
elected along with 36 others from the ASD, MBL [Movement for a 
Free Bolivia], MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], USC 
[Solidarity Civic Union], MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary 
Left], Axis [National Convergency Axis], and other independent 
parties.

  [Text] La Paz, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Banks Superintendency, 
the Association of Bolivian Banks, and financial organizations 
have decided not to lift the bank secrecy but to implement a 
code of ethics to prevent the Bolivian banking system from 
engaging in money laundering. 
  This and other agreements were reached at the end of a 
seminar on money laundering held in La Paz, sponsored by the 
United Nations and attended by drug enforcement experts. 
  The possibility of lifting the bank secrecy was ruled out 
during the seminar and it was announced that a draft code of 
ethics for bankers would be proposed seeking to safeguard the 
credibility of the banking system. It was also announced that 
mechanisms to control illegal operations will be implemented. 
  Banks Superintendent Ramiro Cabezas explained that "bank 
secrecy as such does not exist," because the law provides for 
the supply of information at the request of a judge 
investigating alleged illegal financial operations. 
  Cabezas said the Bolivian financial system, which is not yet 
contaminated by the money laundering, is very small in 
comparison with the volume of money "laundered" or legalized in 
the rest of the world. 
  According to the United Nations, $500 billion annually are 
laundered. Some $2.2 billion are deposited in the Bolivian 
banking system. 
  Javier Zuazo, president of the Association of Bolivian 
Banks, 
explained the need to include in the new banking law some 
mechanism to identify laundering and to punish those responsible. 
  Zuazo said: "One cannot overlook the evidence. It is a 
scourge that affects all financial systems of the world," adding 
that the banks "have the duty to supply information" in cases of 
deposits of dubious origin. 
  Superintendent Cabezas recommended some measures, among them 
the setting of a ceiling for cash operations to prevent 
laundering and the need for bankers to identify their clients in 
order to protect themselves from illegal operations. 
  Bolivia is the second coca producer in the world, after 
Peru, 
and the second drug processor in the world, after Colombia, 
although experts say the benefits of this illegal trade do not 
return to this country, the poorest in the region.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Bolivia monitored through 9 
June. 
  Private mining increased 41 percent in 1993, the highest 
growth in the past 50 years. This increase was prompted mainly 
by the expansion project implemented by the Inti Raymi Company, 
which invested $150 million to improve gold production. The 
Mining Association reported that gold registered a record 
production of 6.56 metric tons in 1993. Silver production 
increased 38 percent, and lead 14 percent. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO 
in Spanish 28 May 94 National Section p 1) 
  Central Bank statistics show that gold exports generated 21 
percent of the total value of mining exports in 1993, when they 
amounted to $76.3 million. They represented only 2 percent of 
mining exports in 1985, 11 percent in 1989, and 21 percent in 
1993. Exports went from $21.9 million in 1992 to $76.3 million 
in 1993. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in Spanish 28 May 94 National 
Section p 2) 
  The National Statistics Institute, INE, reported that 
exports 
amounted to $216 million in the first quarter of 1994, an 
increase of 33.7 percent; imports totalled $253 million, a drop 
of 1.6 percent. Mining increased 18 percent, hydrocarbons 10.5 
percent, and nontraditional exports 72 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON 
in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p B2) 
  Integration Under Secretary Victor Rico on 30 May reported 
that Bolivian exports to Chile dropped "dramatically" from $30 
million to $12 million in the past three years. The commercial 
deficit, which totals $100 million, is caused by the 
restrictions imposed by Chile on some Bolivian products; by the 
export of certain products to other markets; and by the poor 
diversification of products offered by Bolivian exporters in the 
past few years. (Cochabamba LOS TIEMPOS in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 
A8) 
  The Chamber of Exporters reported that Santa Cruz's exports 
totalled 73,103 metric tons at a value of $29.305 million in the 
first quarter of 1994, almost double the figure registered in 
the same period in 1993. This shows that the volume of exports 
increased by 75 percent, and its value by 98 percent. Peru is 
Santa Cruz' main market with $12.4 million, Argentina with $5.1 
million, and Colombia with $4.9 million. (La Paz PRESENCIA in 
Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 4) 
  On 31 May the INE reported that economic activity increased 
4.3 percent in the year's first four months as compared with the 
same period in 1993. Hydrocarbons increased 11 percent; oil and 
gas production 19.8 percent and 10.7 percent respectively; 
mining 9.6 percent; manufacturing production 4.4 percent; 
services 7.4 percent; and energy 8.7 percent. (La Paz PRESENCIA 
in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p 1) 
  The National Chamber of Industries reported that industry 
continues to decline. A survey on industrial performance 
results in the fourth quarter of 1993 showed that sales dropped 
6.0 percent; financing 3.7 percent; and production 0.4 percent. 
Industry, however, accounted for 16 percent of GDP despite the 
unfavorable results. (La Paz HOY in Spanish 3 Jun 94 p 20) 
  The INE reported that the inflation rate was 0.6 percent in 
May, 2.41 percent in the first five months of the year, and 8.14 
percent over the past 12 months. Food and beverage prices 
increased 0.32 percent; clothing and shoes 0.38 percent; home 
appliances 1.2 percent; health 1.33 percent; transport and 
communications 0.23 percent; education 0.1 percent; 
entertainment and culture 2.28 percent; and goods and services 
0.68 percent. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 1 Jun 94 p B5) 
  The World Bank approved $15 million in credit to be designed 
for the state-owned companies capitalization program. This loan 
is in addition to the $50 million in credit agreed by the bank 
during Capitalization Minister Alfonso Revollo's visit to the 
United States. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 28 May 94 p 12)

<F P=106> [By Lucia Helena Gazzola] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo, 9 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today released 
the first major project of his campaign: "More and better jobs 
for Brazilians." The project, providing for the creation of 
more than 8 million jobs over the 1995-98 period, assumes that 
"the central axis of the policy for reactivating jobs will be 
expanding the level of investment in the Brazilian economy, 
which in 1993 was 16 percent of GDP, to approximately 25 
percent." During an interview, Lula and project coordinator 
Aloizio Mercadante admitted what the text of the project says in 
its final part: The private sector will have to create "the 
bulk" of the new jobs. 
  "The private sector will have to make the bulk of 
investments, although I cannot specify the percentage of such 
investments," Mercadante said, adding that this will be possible 
only if the government creates the appropriate conditions. "If 
the government promotes development and reactivates growth, if 
it guarantees financial resources, and if it ends financial 
speculation, private investment will grow and will go to the 
productive sector," he said. Lula gave vague answers when asked 
whether there will be money for the project. "If there is no 
money, we will have to create it; we will make great efforts 
with the private sector, and will negotiate with entrepreneurs 
for a year to have them to join the National Solidarity Fund to 
be created in 1996 to promote the project, reminding them that 
the richest brackets are responsible for the recuperation of 
Brazil," he said. 
  For the "urgent" creation of jobs, the project provides for 
the implementation of a basic sanitation program (from 250,000 
to 375,000 new jobs), the repair and construction of 25,000 km 
of urban highways (70,000 jobs), the construction of storage 
facilities with 6 million tons' capacity (70,000), a 
"revolutionary" education program (300,000), the recovery of Sao 
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro hospital beds (36,000), land reform 
(1,100,000), credits for investment in small estates 
(2,160,000), expansion of farm production (150,000), plus 
500,000 jobs in urban areas caused by an annual 4 percent growth 
of farm production, 500,000 to 1 million new jobs created by 
increased production of small and mid-sized agricultural 
industries in the interior, investment in tourism (120,000), 
highway network maintenance (90,000), and a housing program 
(411,000). The PT also will encourage the creation of 
cooperatives, micro and small-sized enterprises, entrepreneurial 
partnerships, "enterprise nurseries," and the reduction of the 
work week to allow for the creation of new jobs. 
  "The task of creating jobs will be mostly a private sector 
responsibility," the project text says, noting that the state 
will implement a development policy that will encourage the 
creation of new jobs. To this end the PT claims that it is 
essential to expand the offer of credits for productive 
investment. "This will call for a comprehensive reform of the 
financial system, to end financial speculation." Among the 
sources of funds, the project mentions the FTGS [Severance Pay 
Fund] ($4 billion annually), the Fund for Protection of Workers 
($5 billion annually), constitutional funds ($1 billion), the 
Social Development Fund, the National Education Development 
Fund, the PIS/PASEP [Social Integration Program/Government 
Employee Welfare Fund], and official development agencies and 
banks. 
  The project provides for the creation of two other funds: 
the 
National Solidarity Fund (made up of budget funds and the taxes 
on big fortunes), and the Productive Restructuring Fund. Lula 
said he also counts on foreign investment.

<F P=106> [Report by Rosa Costa] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 10 Jun (AE) -- Ten people have registered 
at the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) as presidential 
candidates. The deadline for coalitions and parties to file 
their respective petitions expired at 1900 today. The TSE will 
review the documents submitted by the presidential hopefuls 
before officially approving their candidacies. The electoral 
timetable provides that the TSE will have to rule on petitions 
and appeals by 20 July. 
  The candidates are: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers 
Party], Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party], Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party], Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party], 
Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Popular Renewal Party], Flavio Rocha (PL) 
[Liberal Party], Eneas Carneiro (PRONA) [Party for the 
Redefinition of the National Order], Hernani Goulart Fortuna 
(PSC) [Social Christian Party], Walter Queiroz (PRN) [National 
Reconstruction Party], and Caetano Matano (PT do B) [Brazilian 
Workers Party -- Partido Trabalhista do Brasil]. They represent 
18 of the 21 parties -- most of which have formed coalitions -- 
that are qualified to nominate presidential candidates. The PP 
[Popular Party], the PRP [Progressive Republican Party], and the 
PMN [National Mobilization Party] are staying out of the race. 
  Only the PSDB and PDT candidates personally appeared before 
the TSE to submit their documents. All other candidates were 
represented by members of their parties. 
  Two petitions to register party names that are not legally 
constituted were also processed even though they do not have a 
provisional register. They are the PNSDC [National Social 
Democratic Christian Party -- Partido Nacional Social 
Democratico Cristao] and the PTRB [Brazilian Labor Renewal Party 
-- Partido Trabalhista Renovador Brasileiro]. In principle 
these petitions comply with legal provisions. They will be 
reviewed by TSE members at the beginning of next week. They

for president and vice president fulfill the requirements 
established by the party and electoral laws and the Constitution.

<F P=106> [Report from Washington by AE correspondent Paulo Sotero] </F>
  [Excerpt] Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is 
sounding out the U.S. Government and other governments of 
developed countries about his chances as candidate for president 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO), the international 
organization created through the accords of the Uruguay Round of 
the GATT talks to replace the GATT secretariat. Sources in the 
Mexican Government and in the Clinton administration have 
confirmed that there have been consultations on this matter. 
  In Brasilia, an official source said that the Brazilian 
Government views the possible launching of Salinas' candidacy as 
normal, and no cause for concern. This week the Brazilian 
Government officially launched the candidacy of Finance Minister 
Rubens Ricupero for this post. Ricupero, who served earlier as 
the Brazilian ambassador to GATT, earned the respect of the 
formulators of international trade policies in Geneva because of 
the role he performed as chairman of the contracting parties at 
a difficult juncture of the long Uruguay Round negotiations. 
  According to Luiz Felipe Lampreia, the incumbent Brazilian 
ambassador to GATT, Ricupero's candidacy emerged naturally in 
talks with the GATT "inner circle" -- with the support of 
European, Asian, and Latin American countries -- after GATT 
Director Peter Sutherland announced that he is not interested in 
leading the new organization. An official source said: "Rather 
than launch Ricupero's candidacy, all the Brazilian Government 
did was take over an initiative originated by others." [passage

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 9 
June. 
  Beginning in February, the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo 
stock 
market operations experienced a sharp drop. The Sao Paulo stock 
market suffered losses in real value unit terms of 20.95 percent 
in April, while the Rio de Janeiro stock market lost 22 percent 
during the same period of time. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 27 May 94 p 21) 
  Compared to the same month in 1993, when it totaled $902 
million, the April trade surplus increased 56.98 percent and 
totaled $1.416 billion; exports totaled $3.635 billion and 
imports $2.219 billion. Exports accumulated over the last 12 
months have reached the historic level of $38.931 billion, and 
imports $26.537 billion. Trade volume, i.e. the two operations 
added, totaled $65.468 billion in this period, with the balance 
a surplus of $12.394 billion. Compared to March, exports 
increased by 8.4 percent, imports dropped by 4.4 percent, and 
the balance increased by 37.4 percent. Compared to 1993, during 
the January to May period exports increased by 1.8 percent, from 
$12.284 billion to $12.514 billion; imports increased 12.03 
percent, from $7.356 billion to $8.241 billion; and the balance 
surplus decreased by 13.29 percent, from $4.928 billion to 
$4.273 billion. Trade volume in the period totaled $20.775 
billion, which is 5.68 percent higher that the $19.64 billion 
registered in 1993. (Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO in 
Portuguese 2 Jun 94 p B11) 
  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, 
has reported that the May inflation rate in Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro totaled an average 44.11 percent, which is 0.59 percent 
lower than in April. In Sao Paulo the Broad Consumer Price 
Index totaled 44.32 percent, and in Rio de Janeiro 43.52 
percent. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1727 GMT 3 Jun 
94) 
  The Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Ministry closed on 29 
April an investigation into "dumping" charges against imported 
Greek canned peaches. The investigation was requested by the 
Pelotas Union of Fruit and Preserves Industries in October 1993. 
A lawsuit was opened one month later, and in December a 44 
percent tax began to be collected on these imports. Brazil will 
now have to return the tax collected from December 1993 to 
April, as the government has recognized that this is its second 
mistake regarding "dumping" charges. The first was with 
reference to the alleged dumping of EC powdered milk imports. 
International trade adviser Adimar Schievelbeing insists, 
however, that the Greek peaches reach Brazil at the price of 
$0.40 per can, while the price in Greece is $1.22. (Sao Paulo 
GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 6 Jun 94 p 5) 
  Implementation of the real will result in the closure of 188 
Bank of Brazil branches in the interior of the country. In 
addition to being permanently in deficit, these branches are 
located in towns where most of the banking operations are 
concentrated in branches of the Federal Savings Bank and of the 
Northeast Bank. The strategy for closing the branches will be 
gradual, but will have to be concluded by November. (Brasilia 
Radio Nacional da Amazonia Network in Portuguese 1000 GMT 7 Jun 
94) 
  According to data reported by the Foreign Trade Secretariat, 
Brazilian oil imports from January to March totaled $504 million 
FOB (Free on Board). This represents a 32 percent drop compared 
to the same period in 1993. Brazilian oil imports in April 
totaled $151 million FOB, i.e., 57.3 percent greater than in 
March, when the oil imports totaled $96 million FOB. Compared 
to April 1993, when products totaling $153 million FOB were 
imported, there has been a 1.3 percent drop. (Sao Paulo FOLHA 
DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 2 p 2) 
  As a result of exports and foreign investment, $3.62 billion 
have entered the country so far this year. This sum is 
equivalent to more than the overall amount in real cruzeiros 
currently in circulation. In April the amount totaled only 
$2.82 billion, but investment in the stock market this month 
alone totaled $710 million net. Despite reports of the 
suspension of foreign investment in the stock market in March 
and April, figures show that $295 million were invested in March 
and $415 million in April, and that no net foreign capital left 
the market during these months. Trade operations -- exports 
minus imports -- reached in May the record level of $3.02 
billion, although in April they totaled only $2.61 billion. 
These figures, however, do not reflect the amount of exported 
products, but investment made in the futures market. The 
financial balance surplus in May totaled $610 million, while the 
total in April had been $45 million. The best level, however, 
was obtained in January, when it totaled $1.15 billion. Foreign 
reserves currently total $38.2 billion, and less than $9 billion 
will be used to guarantee the real. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO 
PAULO in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 Section 1 p 4) 
  Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero reported to the Rural 
Democratic Union congressional bloc on the morning of 8 June 
that a study conducted by Anfavea, the Applied Economic-Social 
Research Institute, indicates that the agricultural sector will 
grow 6.6 percent this year. He said that Anfavea data confirm 
this, and show an increase of 90 percent in the sale of tractors 
and of 70 percent in the sale of agricultural machinery on the 
domestic market. Ricupero also explained that the price of 
agricultural produce has remained 25 percent above the average 
price for the last 60 months, and that the Treasury has already 
allocated almost $1 billion to the sector this year, although 
the entire amount allocated last year was only $1.2 billion. 
The government plans to allocate a total of $2.6 billion to the 
sector this year. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720 
GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  During the first five months in 1994 the car manufacturing 
industry produced a record number of 630,825 vehicles: 475,776 
of them remained in the domestic market, and 148,913 were 
exported. Luiz Adelar Scheuer, president of the National 
Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers, said that by 
December 1.5 million cars will have easily been manufactured in 
the country. He criticized, however, the government decision to 
increase interest rates before implementing the new currency. 
He said this will divert money from production into investment. 
(Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1720 GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  The number of cars sold on the domestic market in May 
increased by 18.5 percent compared to April, and totaled 111,483 
units. Compared to the same month in 1993, this number increased 
by 24 percent. This number includes the sale of Brazilian-made 
cars, of cars assembled in the country, and of cars imported by 
companies affiliated to the Brazilian Association of Automotive 
Vehicle Importing Companies, Abeiva. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 8 Jun 94 p 1) 
  A poll conducted by the National Confederation of 
Industries, 
CNI, the results of which were announced by its President Mario 
Amato, indicates that competition with imported products has 
forced Brazilian entrepreneurs to improve their quality control 
and rationalize production. The opening of the national market 
to imported products has made companies reduce costs, increase 
productivity, and improve technologies. Nearly 80 percent of 
the interviewed entrepreneurs, who work for 1,136 different 
companies, said that the opening resulted in greater 
productivity and lower costs. Forty percent of them, however, 
believe there has been an increase in the number of products 
being dumped, or sold for prices lower than those in the 
countries from which they were imported. Nearly 70 percent of 
those interviewed, however, pointed out that profitability has 
decreased. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2106 GMT 9 
Jun 94) 
  An IBGE poll conducted from 30 April to 30 May indicates 
that 
the Expanded Consumer Price Index rate, which reflects the 
behavior of prices for families with earnings from one up to 40 
minimum wages, in the month of May increased by 44.03 percent. 
According to the National Consumer Price Index, which considers 
families living on one to eight minimum wages per month, the 
inflation rate totaled 42.73 percent, 0.13 percent less than in 
April. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2247 GMT 9 Jun

  [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei announced today that during the upcoming Cartagena summit, 
he will explain the Chilean plan to eradicate poverty that will 
be proposed at the Social Summit in Copenhagen. 
  Speaking before the United Nations in 1993, former Chilean 
President Patricio Aylwin proposed a social summit to undertake 
a global effort to eradicate poverty, which affects millions of 
people around the world. 
  During a meeting today with foreign correspondents, Frei 
stressed the importance of the Cartagena summit. He said he 
will use the opportunity to hold bilateral meetings with 
presidents from neighboring countries, with Spanish King Juan 
Carlos, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera, and Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  Regarding Cuba, with which Chile maintains ties at the 
consular level, Frei noted the appointment of Ambassador 
Patricio Pozo, the former Chilean representative to Costa Rica, 
as Chilean consul to Cuba. He also mentioned Chilean-Cuban 
commercial and tourism ties. Frei commented on the credit line 
granted to Cuba for the purchase of foodstuffs from Chile, as 
well as Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming visit. 
Frei said that during his talk with Castro, we will continue to 
discuss the strengthening of bilateral ties seeking to 
consolidate democracy and uphold human rights. 
  Frei reasserted his opposition to a unilateral armed action 
against Haiti, but hastily condemned the serious situation in 
that country. He said: "We do not favor unilateral solutions 
and will support all multilateral measures adopted by the 
international community that seek to restore democracy in Haiti." 
  Open regionalism will be one of the priority proposals to be 
made by Frei at the Cartagena Summit. Frei stated: "In an 
integrated world, in which large economic blocs like the EU, 
NAFTA (among the United States, Mexico and Canada), and APEC 
(Asian-Pacific Economic Corporation) are being consolidated we, 
as Latin Americans, must also be present. A Latin American 
union should not be a closed association, it should help us to 
open these markets." 
  Development with equity, the fight against poverty and 
crime, 
and drug enforcement are also included in the Chilean proposal. 
Frei said: "Particularly, a clear political idea to achieve 
progress regarding integration." 
  He stressed the Chilean decision to join the Common Market 
of 
the South (Mercosur) which originally comprised Argentina, 
Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
  The Cartagena Summit will be the first international 
conference to be attended by President Eduardo Frei since he 
assumed power on 11 March. 
  Frei will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Washington 
on 28 June. He will attend the Rio Summit in September, and 
attend the APEC Summit meeting in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 
November. During this meeting Chile will be accepted as a 
member country. 
  On 9 and 10 December, Frei will attend the presidential 
summit in Miami called by President Clinton. Speaking about the 
possible duplication as a result of the Ibero-American summit in 
Cartagena and the Summit of the Americas in Miami, Frei said he 
believes all efforts to increase the number of meetings of Latin 
American presidents or European leaders are positive.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Suitability of NAFTA"] </F>
  [Text] Although the possibility of Chile reaching an 
agreement with the United States -- either by joining NAFTA or 
by signing a bilateral agreement -- has been a recurrent subject 
over the past few months, only now that the two governments have 
started informal talks have some people expressed their concern. 
  Lack of information on the various aspects and consequences 
of future negotiations has triggered legitimate fears that must 
be discussed. The truth is that these fears should have been 
discussed some time ago so that they could be assessed and 
debated. Anyway, over the next few months the government will 
release adequate information about NAFTA, will study the 
suitability of joining NAFTA or some other bilateral agreement, 
and will promote technical studies in various sectors. 
  One thing is quite clear: Reaching a free trade agreement 
with the United States -- either a bilateral agreement or by 
joining NAFTA -- will be beneficial for Chile because it 
involves its main commercial and financial partner. Moreover, 
in the case of the second alternative, one must bear in mind 
that North America is a market of 360 million consumers with an 
annual per capita income of $20,000 in the United States, 
$19,000 in Canada, and a little more than $2,700 in Mexico. 
  Moreover, trade with that region is significant. Some 19 
percent of Chilean annual exports go to North America, 17 
percent of which go to the United States. Chilean annual 
imports amount to $660 million, 75 percent of which come from 
the United States, 21 percent from Canada, and 4 percent from 
Mexico. 
  It should also be remembered that an agreement would make it 
possible for custom and non-custom barriers, which affect almost 
25 percent of Chilean foreign trade, to be lifted over 15 years. 
  The move would also improve Chile's image because reaching a 
bilateral agreement with the United States means complying with 
a series of strict requirements. It would step up foreign 
investments because Chile's name will occupy a higher 
"investment grade" [two preceding words in English], which would 
be appreciated by foreign businessmen. 
  These benefits will vary according to the type of agreement 
reached with the United States. They will probably be much 
stiffer if Chile joins NAFTA, an agreement that has obvious 
advantages. 
  Among these advantages is that the terms are already known, 
thus allowing Chile to simultaneously negotiate with Canada and 
Mexico, and increase its chances of gaining access to those 
markets. It will clearly regulate labor and environment aspects 
and offer a good opportunity to negotiate with other countries, 
especially those of the Asian bloc. 
  On the other hand, in a bilateral agreement Chile's 
interests 
might be diminished by the greater negotiating power of the 
United States. Lastly, failing to reach an agreement would be 
very costly for Chile because it would cause uncertainty among 
the economic agents and weaken bilateral relations with that 
important partner.

  [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean President Eduardo 
Frei today downplayed criticism of Army Commander Augusto 
Pinochet's recent trip by stating that ties with the Chilean 
Armed Forces are "extraordinarily positive." 
  Ever since his first speeches, Frei has noted the 
"impersonality of power" as a government formula: "In this 
case, there are no personal ties, only institutional ties. 
Government ties with the Armed Forces and their commanders are 
extraordinarily positive." 
  Frei stated that a discussion agenda has been drafted on 
issues the government believes should be defense policy 
guidelines. 
  He said: "General Pinochet made a trip at the institutional 
level. I met with him before his trip and we will assess his 
trip when he returns, as is done with all the Armed Forces 
commanders." 
  Gen. Pinochet's visit to Europe caused protests among some 
European associations, particulary during his stay in the Czech 
Republic.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Chile monitored through 9 June. 
  On 7 June the Central Bank reported that the Chilean trade 
balance registered a $334.2 million surplus between 1 January to 
15 May, with exports at $3.9001 billion and imports at $3.5659 
billion. This figure differs from the $62.2 million deficit 
registered during the same period in 1993, and confirms Chile's 
rebound in exports, which had been affected in 1993 by the drop 
in the prices of copper, cellulose, fishmeal, and fruit, among 
other products. Economic authorities said that the increase in 
the price of copper greatly contributed to improving the trade 
balance. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1753 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  The Andean Board, headquartered in Lima, reported that the 
Andean Group has become a major Chilean trade partner in the 
past few years. Sales to these countries went from $525 million 
in 1992 to $585 million in 1993. However, exports to Japan 
dropped from $1.714 billion to $1.543 billion; to the United 
States from $1.58 billion to $1.532 billion; and to Brazil from 
$451 million to $424 million. During this period Chile exported 
to the Andean area a greater number of products than any other 
country, with the number of various products rising from 2,456 
to 2,509. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1638 GMT 3 Jun 94) 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry Economic Department has 
reported 
that Chile's foreign investments since 1990 amount to $3.486 
billion, out of which a total of $2.373 billion was invested in 
Argentina, $636 million in Peru; $192.9 million in Brazil; and 
$69 million in Venezuela. Investments were also made in Panama, 
with $39.9 million; Cuba, $32.3 million; Ecuador, $16.4 million; 
Bolivia, $7.5 million; Colombia, $6.9 million; Uruguay, $2.7 
million; Costa Rica, $1 million; and Mexico, $750,000. A total 
of 105 companies have invested abroad. (Madrid EFE in Spanish

<F P=106> [From the "24 Hours Newcast"] </F>
  [Text] Colombia signed a trade and economic cooperation 
agreement with 31 Caribbean countries this evening. Foreign 
Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos explained the scope of the 
agreement. 
  [Begin Santos recording] A great opportunity has been opened 
for Colombia's productive sector because at this time we export 
to the Caribbean no more than $65 million. This is the first 
time the Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] has signed an 
agreement establishing reciprocity. In other words, we open our 
markets to them and they in turn open their markets to us. That 
had never happened before with the Caricom countries. In

  [Text] Lima, 10 Jun (EFE) -- The Peruvian press reports 
today that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar 
has finally decided to run for president. The press reports add 
that Perez de Cuellar hopes to officially announce his decision 
in August. 
  According to the newspaper EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar's 
decision was announced by a group of Peruvian politicians, 
businessmen, and personalities who met him a few days ago in 
Paris, where Perez de Cuellar currently lives. 
  The Peruvian presidential and legislative elections will be 
held in April 1995 but the deadline for the registration of 
presidential candidates is October 1994. 
  EXPRESO reports that the former UN secretary general hopes 
Police Inspector General Antonio Ketin, responsible for 
capturing Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman in 1992, and Diego 
Garcia Sayon, former Andean Lawyers Commission chairman and an 
old leftist militant, will be his running mates. 
  According to EXPRESO, Perez de Cuellar has "declined" any 
eventual alliances with traditional political parties that 
support his candidacy. He believes their support will do him 
more harm than good because they will take away votes from him. 
  He has proposed, however, giving more participation in his 
eventual administration to the main party supporting him, the 
Popular Christian Party (PPC), if the main PPC leaders decide to 
withdraw their candidacies to the legislature. 
  Perez de Cuellar approved a list of candidates to the 
legislature encompassing independent politicians identified with 
the opposition, such as Maximo San Roman, who was President 
Alberto Fujimori's vice president until the 1992 coup d'etat. 
  The list also includes personalities such as former Senators 
Enrique Bernales (Socialist) and Raul Ferrero (conservative); 
Daniel Estrade, the leftist mayor of Cusco; and Bar Association 
President Jorge Avendano, among others. 
  Moreover, political circles have reported high-ranking 
Peruvian media representatives also were present in the Paris 
meeting at Perez de Cuellar's request. 
  The same sources reported that Alfredo Barnechea, a 
journalist and former candidate for Lima City Hall for the APRA 
[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]--headed by former 
President Alan Garcia--will be the 75-year-old veteran 
diplomat's campaign manager. Barnechea is married to Perez de 
Cuellar's stepdaughter. 
  Perez de Cuellar's campaign will be launched next week with 
several new members and the collection of signatures to support 
the former UN secretary general's candidacy.

  [Text] Lima, 11 Jun (AFP) -- The Peruvian Government 
extended the state of emergency for 60 days beginning today in 
several provinces of three Amazonian departments, because 
"narcoterrorist actions continue" there, it was officially 
reported today. 
  Meanwhile, the police reported that on the evening of 10 
June 
two policemen and a private agent who were guarding stores--the 
former two in the capital city district of El Agustino and the 
third in San Miguel--were overpowered by presumed Shining Path 
commando units, who seized their weapons. The attackers made 
death threats against the three attack victims and threw 
leaflets referring to the "armed struggle" and expressing 
opposition to the government. 
  This special measure, which is contained in a supreme decree 
published by the EL PERUANO official gazette, affects the 
provinces of the jungle departments of Huanuco, San Martin, and 
Loreto. The provision implies the suspension of constitutional 
guarantees in the areas mentioned and also means that the Armed 
Forces will continue to guarantee public order. 
  Official figures indicate that more than 60 percent of 
national territory falls under this regime and that the 
constitutional guarantees of nearly 50 percent of the Peruvian 
population (22,128,466 inhabitants) have been restricted since 
the start of the "fratricidal war" in 1980 in Ayacucho, in the 
southeastern Andean region, which has claimed more than 27,000 
lives.

  Congressman Julio Castro Gomez said the terrorists' release 
is a very serious event that should be explained to the country 
by the interior and justice ministers. Castro announced that he 
has submitted a note requesting that the two ministers of the 
cabinet of President Alberto Fujimori appear before a plenary 
session of Congress or before the congressional executive board.

<F P=106> [Unattributed interview with former Minister of Economy Juan </F>
Carlos Hurtado Miller; place and date not given: "Hurtado 
Proposes Putting All CPT Privatization Revenues Into 
Agriculture;" first paragraph is EL COMERCIO introduction] 
  [Text] A new "agrarian reform" so the campesinos will no 
longer just be producers, but will instead become businessmen, 
with full financing to come from the over $2 billion generated 
by the privatization of the CPT [Peruvian Telephone Company] was 
proposed yesterday by Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller, former 
Minister of Agriculture (during the government of Fernando 
Belaunde) and former chairman of the Council of Ministers and 
Minister of Economy and Finance (during the present government). 
A former Popular Action activist, Hurtado Miller (born in Lima 
in 1940) graduated from the National Agrarian University in 
1962, a year after the present head of state, Alberto Fujimori. 
In an interview with EL COMERCIO, he said it is now time for 
agriculture to emerge from the prostration in which it has been 
sunk for the past 20 years. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Why should agriculture be the priority sector 
to get the $2 billion from privatizing the Peruvian Telephone 
Company? 
  [Hurtado] For economic development reasons. This sector can 
give the fastest response with a little investment. We can 
improve our food supply and diversify our exports. We would also 
be able to stabilize our food growth, improve our price 
structure, and create greater territorial integration. On the 
social side, it is urgent to attack critical poverty and improve 
the occupation of Peru's territory. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Why has agriculture been the sector least 
favored by the state in recent times? 
  [Hurtado] There are spectacular figures that destroy the 
economy. From 1980 to 1984 agricultural subsidies declined 
systematically. That trend was reversed in 1985; agricultural 
subsidies soared and came to $944 million in 1988. In 1989 these 
subsidies were $2.64 billion. And subsidizing a sector in such a 
total, massive, and generic manner as was done in agriculture by 
the former government does not help that sector. Those subsidies 
favor consumers and undermine the real growth of agriculture. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Are you suggesting there should be no 
subsidies 
for agriculture? 
  [Hurtado] The subsidy system has to exist, but it needs to 
be 
guided, focused, and financed with real resources -- it also 
must be temporary. There cannot be an indiscriminate expansion 
of subsidies via the Central Reserve Bank. This government (the 
Fujimori administration) deactivated the Agrarian Bank because 
it thought the Agrarian Bank was causing inflation. That is not 
true. What creates inflation is (inorganic) issues by the 
Central Bank. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Do you think the time has come to promote 
agro-industry with the resources generated by privatization? 
  [Hurtado] This is a great opportunity for Peru. People say 
we 
are going to get $6 billion through privatization. The agrarian 
sector represents 30 percent of the country's population. So it 
should get 30 percent of the resources from privatization: $2 
billion. I propose that all the revenues from privatizing the 
CPT be allocated to the agrarian sector. We need to develop two 
types of agro-industry: high-tech for export purposes and 
intermediate-level technology. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Then we would not need to rely on external 
sources to finance agricultural development? What the now 
flourishing Public Treasury can provide for us is more than 
sufficient? 
  [Hurtado] These resources from privatization ($2 billion) 
can 
generate nearly $1 billion in credit, either from multinational 
organizations, from development banks, or bilateral loans from 
other countries. In the next three or four years we could get $3 
billion. That would create a great boost for the agrarian 
sector, which provides 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. 
<H5>  The Proposal </H5>
  [EL COMERCIO] Tell us about your proposal for using the 
resources from the CPT's privatization. 
  [Hurtado] On a national level we need to make up the deficit 
in the National Food Reserve by allocating $50 million for 
production areas. We need to establish a production and market 
information system and a Promotion Fund to create agricultural 
and seed production services with private industry to ensure 
vertical growth in agriculture. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What needs to be done to revitalize 
agricultural exports? 
  [Hurtado] We propose to create a fund to promote exportable 
crops and export guarantees, starting by targeting specific 
zones for production and promoting social development. The 
BLADEX [Latin American Export Promotion Bank] and FLAR [Latin 
American Reserve Fund] can provide us with $100 million. We are 
also proposing agricultural credit insurance to cover natural 
disasters. 
  [EL COMERCIO] But agriculture also needs technological 
support.... 
  [Hurtado] Our proposal contains a technical assistance 
program, to complement credit, and two programs: one for the 
creation of high-tech agroindustry and the second for primary 
processing with intermediate-level technology. These proposals 
total $520 million, with the resources to come from 
privatization. And we are also considering another $350 million 
in additional funding that could be financed by international 
development banks or by bilateral credits. 
  [EL COMERCIO] Your proposal, divided by regions (coast, 
mountains, and forests), comes to $1.6 billion. For the coast 
you propose establishing a loan guarantee fund. What would that 
involve? 
  [Hurtado] Commercial banks do not make agricultural loans, 
and they are not going to. They say this is a problem of land 
ownership titles. Only 54 percent of our cultivated land area 
has ownership titles. The Loan Guarantee Fund could have $50 
million in cash so that Peruvian banks will earmark $1 billion 
for agrarian credit. I will also mention midterm financing for 
advanced irrigation systems for 100,000 hectares at a cost of 
$200 million. We also need a saline land recovery program 
because 30 percent of the total of $600 million is for the coast. 
  [EL COMERCIO] What about resources to stimulate agrarian 
production in the mountains, which have recently experienced 
population declines, and the forests, where coca plantations now 
occupy our arable land? 
  [Hurtado] For the mountains we are proposing another $600 
for 
three projects: the South American llama and related species 
breeding project, the rural development program, and 
communications infrastructure. For the forests we suggest two 
programs: a coca crop replacement program with a guaranteed 
price, so the state will start to buy from the forests to create 
incentives by promoting other crops like rice or corn. The other 
program is the improvement of our road system. Right now it is 
cheaper to import rice from South Vietnam or the Philippines 
than to get it from Huallaga. That would be the $2 billion 
agrarian development program. So in the future campesinos will 
not get used to living on subsidies or gifts, paternalism, or 
simply on state aid. Instead, the role of private activity will 
be preponderant, it will be the driving force. In summary, 
producers will become businessmen with the determined support of 
commercial banks and with the state providing resources.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Antonio Roman and Candelaria Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 8 Jun -- The State 
Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) has stated 
that in agricultural matters, the various levels of government 
have not kept to the agreements, their proposals are incomplete 
and they seek to deprive jurisdiction, and the truth is that 
"they do not intend to definitely resolve the Chiapas land 
problem." 
  CEOIC, which represents 280 organizations, today warned in a 
communique that "events continue moving toward a confrontation." 
The organizations demand a "break of the military blockade" 
surrounding the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
respect for human rights in Chiapas, and a clear development and 
financing policy for Chiapas land. 
  Upon releasing the CEOIC communique, Arturo Luna Lujan, 
organization secretary for the Independent Agricultural and 
Peasant Workers Central Organization [Central independiente de 
Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos -- CIOAC] said that due to 
noncompliance by the federal and state governments, the peasant 
associations will start a permanent sit-down strike opposite the 
Tuxtla Gutierrez government palace. 
  One must remember that on 14 April, during one of the most 
critical moments of the land takeover, the CEOIC and several 
federal and state government entities, signed a truce agreement 
regarding the agrarian situation in Chiapas. In this truce 
agreement, peasant organizations that comprise CEOIC pledged to 
suspend the occupation of properties and land, while government 
authorities pledged to resolve the state's agrarian problem. 
  Among the main agrarian problems afflicting Chiapas are an 
enormous land tenancy, much agrarian backwardness, multiple 
presidential resolutions that have not been carried out, and 
hundreds of unfulfilled land requests. 
  Currently, despite the fact the exact area is not known, it 
is reported that about 50,000 hectares have been taken by Indian 
and peasant organizations in several places in the state, and a 
further 40,000 hectares within the conflict area, mainly in 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas Municipalities -- the 
latter being where the EZLN is located. 
  At the same time the CEOIC and government were signing the 
agreement on 14 April, negotiations were also begun with other 
government entities at the federal level, such as with the 
Social Development and Government Secretariats, with which a 
series of measures and meetings were agreed upon to deal with 
the various demands presented by the groups that comprise CEOIC. 
  "Despite these agreements, the replies have been 
noncompliance, proposals have been incomplete and seek to 
deprive jurisdiction, and a there is a lack of desire to resolve 
once and for all the Chiapas land problem," the brief CEOIC text 
states. It regrets that despite all its efforts to reach true 
peace, with justice, democracy, and social development, events 
advance toward confrontation. 
  That is why to solve their demands, the CEOIC demands the 
presence and commitment of Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno; 
Secretaries Victor Cervera Pacheco, Carlos Rojas, and Carlos 
Hank Gonzalez, for Agrarian Reform, Social Development, and 
Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, respectively; Jorge Madrazo 
Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission; 
Humberto Benitez Trevino, Attorney General of the Republic; and 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas State. 
  Peasant leader Arturo Luna Lujan said that CEOIC members 
watch the weeks go by without receiving a definite reply from 
the authorities because until now all they have received have 
been written proposals. This situation has generated a climate 
of uncertainty and desperation, therefore the council peasants 
have decided to resort to a permanent sit-down strike as a way 
to exert pressure on the federal and local governments to give a 
positive reply to these demands. 
  When referring to the number of strikers, Luna Lujan said 
there will be between 2,000-5,000 peasants and Indians, but the 
numbers could increase gradually as the days pass without true 
solutions. 
  We are asked not to takeover land, not to hinder the peace 
and reconciliation process, but the authorities "do not make the 
slightest effort to keep their word or to contribute to the 
creation of a climate of stability that leads to a favorable 
situation for signing the peace agreements," he concluded.

  [Text] After learning of the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army's rejection of the peace proposals presented by the Mexican 
Government, the Presidency of the republic issued the following 
communique: 
  In line with the will of the Mexican Government to safeguard 
peace and to obtain the economic and political development of 
the region that is in crisis, President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari has ordered the secretaries of National Defense, 
Government, Social Development, Communication and Transport, and 
Health to continue rigorously complying with programs previously 
decided upon. 
  The communique adds: The president has ordered the National 
Defense secretary to maintain the cease-fire unilaterally 
declared on 12 January to continue patrol and relief operations 
along the country's southern border, and to conduct the 
necessary operations to prevent the smuggling of weapons into 
the region. 
  The president also ordered the commissioner for peace to 
report to the people about these specific decisions and about 
the government's decision to continue promoting peace through a 
political resolution of the conflict.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said he is willing to 
mediate between Cuba and the United States to eliminate the 
economic embargo on the island, however, "no one has asked us to 
mediate, and we are not in the habit of going where we have not 
been invited." In a short news conference, shortly before 
leaving for Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Salinas de Gortari 
said he is convinced the blockade solves nothing and added: "we 
believe it should be lifted and in this manner bridges for 
communication and dialogue would be built." [passage omitted] 
  The Mexican president said the visit was "very positive and 
cordial and strengthened the traditional good relations that 
exist between our two countries." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba's ambassador 
to Mexico Abelardo Curbelo has said that the visit Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Cuba Monday "is 
an expression of a political nature." 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the diplomat did not rule out 
the possibility of some cooperation agreement, which may include 
the oil sector, being signed as part of the Mexican president's 
activities during his six-hour visit to the island. 
  The diplomat said: "The essence of (Salinas') meeting with 
Fidel Castro is to increase the ties of friendship that exist 
between the two countries in all fields." 
  Curbelo added: "This minisummit is an expression of a 
political, not economic nature, but I will not deny that some 
kind of cooperation agreements, such as the one Mexpetrol 
negotiated with Cuban firms to send Mexican crude oil to the 
Cuban refinery, could be signed." 
  Curbelo explained that the negotiations process between a 
Cuban firm and Mexpetrol, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum, was 
reached between the two enterprises, without government 
participation. 
  The diplomat said Cuba and Mexico are continuing 
negotiations 
in sectors such as telephone, tourism, and others "about which 
we prefer not to talk and which we keep quiet about in order not 
to obstruct them." 
  Curbelo said the Cuban Government permits the participation 
of foreign capital -- from Mexico as well as from other 
countries -- and agreements do not depend on the presidential 
visit or official events because the agreements are among 
enterprises themselves. 
  The ambassador noted: This is why the signing of agreements 
do not depend on a deadline or a meeting. If we find that an 
agreement can be signed Monday, however, it will be done in a 
symbolic way. 
  Curbelo explained that Cuba is seeking oil agreements with 
various nations to stabilize oil supplies "based on market 
conditions and not on preferential price treatment, which is not 
our objective right now." 
  He said plans for securing stable oil supplies must be based 
on the Cuban economy's capacity and efficiency within the 
framework of world market conditions. "These are our 
objectives," he said. 
  If preferential prices are granted, he explained, this will 
depend on the other countries, on the possibility of them buying 
Cuban products, and on Cuba's export capabilities. 
  President Salinas will visit Cuba Monday. He will stay there 
six hours and review the bilateral agenda and issues of common 
interest with Fidel Castro. 
  President Salinas will attend a dinner hosted by Castro, and 
later he will travel to Colombia where he will participate in 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will be attended by the 
presidents or heads of state of Spain, Portugal, and 21 Latin 
American countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Resendez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At Los Pinos presidential residence, President 
Salinas has announced that 80,000 Mexican teachers will be 
guaranteed access to credits to purchase homes in the coming two 
years. President Salinas affirmed the signing of the agreement 
to finance a housing program for teachers. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] As I have said here, 80,000 loans, 
which will be financed with some 3.900 billion new pesos, will 
be granted to teachers in the coming 24 months. The federal 
government, the state governments, and the national banking 
system will grant these funds. [end recording] 
  This credit agreement came into force on 8 June and was 
signed by Elba Ester Gordillo, secretary general of the National 
Coordinating Board of Education Workers; Jose Madariaga Lomeli, 
vice president of the Mexican Banking Association; and Jose 
Angel Pescador Osuna, education secretary. Pescador noted that 
the CEPA [expansion unknown] contributed 72 million new pesos to 
the program. Later, in the Avila Camacho Hall, President 
Salinas announced reductions in the prices of agricultural tools 
and tractors of up to a 160 horsepower. These reductions seek 
to strengthen the capitalization of the Mexican agricultural 
sector. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Reductions in the price of these 
basic agricultural tools range from a minimum of 33 percent to 
discounts of more than 40 percent. [end recording] 
  President Salinas said these discounts entered into effect 
on 
8 June, and announced that credit packages are available to 
enable farmers to buy the equipment promptly. President Salinas 
also noted the production results for the Fall-Winter period: 
over 4 million tons of corn, over 3.5 million tons of wheat, and 
over 350,000 tons of beans. These figures, he added, surpass 
previous averages.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The explosion of a 
car bomb today at a Guadalajara hotel was, apparently, the work 
of individuals involved in drug trafficking, according to the 
preliminary reports released today by Jalisco State authorities. 
  A car bomb exploded at dawn on Saturday in the capital of 
Jalisco in western Mexico, causing two deaths and injuring five 
people, according to the Office of the State District Attorney 
(PGJE). 
  In a communique, the PGJE explained that the explosion took 
place during a birthday party at the hotel, which was attended 
by "families that may be related to the family of Rafael Caro 
Quintero." 
  Drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca 
alias "Don Neto" are serving prison sentences for their 
involvement in the 1985 murder of U.S. DEA agent Enrique 
Camarena. 
  According to a document released by the Jalisco authorities, 
cards were found at the tables with the names of the following 
families: the Quintero Echeverria Family, the Perez Quintero 
Family, and the Hernandez Quintero Family. 
  The PGJE said "the 15th Military Zone, Attorney General's 
Office (PGR) and PGJE are conducting a joint investigation." 
Based on the testimony of a witness, the authorities 
established the sequence of events prior to the explosion. 
  According to Arturo Rangel Martinez (who was injured by the 
explosion), at 0200 local time (0800 GMT), he was in the bus 
owned by the music group "The Hurricanes of the North," for 
which he drives. 
  Rangel Martinez testified that he noticed "a parked Ford 
Grand Marquis, which was approached by a young man wearing a 
dark suit." According to the PGJE communique, Rangel Martinez 
said that "approximately five minutes later, while he was 
resting inside the bus, he heard and felt an explosion and saw 
that the vehicle had exploded." 
  According to preliminary reports, the PGJE noted, it was 
possible to determine that "the vehicle that exploded had 
apparently been stolen and bore a superimposed license plate 
because, according to records, the plates belonged to another 
vehicle." The explosion damaged the bus owned by the musicians 
who played at the party, and eight other vehicles. 
  The PGJE bulletin explained that the party, in honor of 
Karine Fernandez Castro who turned 15, was attended by 
approximately 200 guests, most of whom came from the northern 
Sinaloa State, one of the states that has the largest number of 
drug trafficking gangs. 
  The car bomb explosion follows the 7 June attempt by an 
armed 
group -- which subsequently confronted policemen -- to murder 
Leonel Quintero Payan, a relative of Caro Quintero, in 
Guadalajara. 
  There was also an incident on 10 June when drug agents 
prevented five armed individuals from kidnapping Leonel Quintero 
Payan, who had been wounded in the attack and was being treated 
at the Del Carmen hospital in this city. 
  "According to forensic investigations conducted so far on 
the 
bodies found at the site of the explosion, it is presumed that 
they are the bodies of two men" whose identities were not 
disclosed by the authorities. The authorities have also 
disclosed that "of the five people hurt in the explosion, four 
of them suffered only slight injuries."

  [Excerpt] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
speaking before the Mexican medical community, condemned the 
Guadalajara, Jalisco State car bomb attack. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] Anonymous violence is one of the 
most brutal criminal actions; it attacks Mexican society's most 
appreciated values and must be strongly rejected. We demand 
that the circumstances regarding this crime be clarified and 
that those responsible receive harsh punishment. We Mexicans 
want to live safely, with tranquillity, and with unity. 
Criminal forces must not be allowed to disturb our country's 
social peace. [end recording] 
  The PRI candidate sent a message of solidarity to the people 
of Guadalajara: 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] Once again, Guadalajara and all 
Jalisco residents suffer events that have absolutely nothing to 
do with these civic-minded and hard-working people. We join 
them in their demands for justice. [end recording] [passage

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Gomez Maza] </F>
  [Text] Division General Ramon Mota Sanchez, chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Commission, said arms trafficking in 
the country "is nothing serious; it is a normal occurrence as it 
is in all countries of the world. It is small-scale smuggling." 
  Mota downplayed the importance of weapons trafficking, 
saying 
he did not believe it was serious but, rather, just "something 
normal, as it is in all countries of the world into which many 
types of articles, such as food or clothing, are smuggled. 
Weapons are also smuggled in, but this is something that has 
always existed, and all countries take measures to try to stop 
it." He said there have been no indicators leading one to 
believe there has been some truly heavy weapons trafficking; 
"there has been just the normal amount, the amount that has 
always existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it." 
  Shortly before attending yesterday's meeting of the recently 
created Consultative and Social Participation Commission of 
Civil Protection at the Government Secretariat, the division 
general, who is also a deputy, confirmed "the weapons smuggling 
that exists (in the country) is on a small scale. It is the 
common smuggling that exists in all countries that share 
borders, and there is no need for alarm or anything." When 
questioned on the front steps of the Government Secretariat at 
approximately 1100, the following questions and answers ensued: 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Is the Chamber of Deputies Defense 
Commission 
conducting any investigation into the recent reports there is a 
trafficking of large amounts of weapons? 
  [Mota] The commission has nothing to do with that. The 
corresponding authorities are the ones who have presented the 
reports, and they are probably conducting investigations, which 
they do on a permanent basis. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] How serious is weapons trafficking? 
  [Mota] I do not believe it is serious. I believe it is 
something normal, as it is in all countries of the world where 
there is arms trafficking, and many types of articles, such as 
food, clothing, and so forth, are smuggled in. Weapons are also 
smuggled in, but this is something that has always existed, and 
all countries take measures to try to stop it. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Our society, then, should not be worried 
about weapons trafficking? 
  [Mota] I do not believe so because the information (which 
was 
leaked about a possible heavy trafficking of weapons and which 
authorities are investigating) is from February. From February 
to the present, there has been no event, no indicator that would 
lead one to believe there has been some truly heavy weapons 
trafficking, just the normal amount, the amount that has always 
existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Who generally engages in trafficking? 
  [Mota] All types of people who travel, especially, to the 
United States and return with some type of weapon. This is why 
I call it small scale. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Do you have any statistics to report on arms 
seizures? 
  [Mota] The Defense and Government Secretariats have just 
published this report. I do not have the figures on hand, but 
they are significant, especially those on drug trafficking. 
  The civil protection programs of the Government Secretariat, 
which is headed by Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz 
Palacios, were analyzed at the meeting Mota attended. 
  People from various sectors that form part of the National 
Council of Civil Protection also attended this meeting. The 
objective of this council is to provide elements of analysis to 
the Government Secretariat so that its civil protection 
activities will reach more people.

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Porras Robles] </F>
  [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National 
Human Rights Commission [CNDH], acknowledged to the head of the 
executive branch, President Salinas de Gortari, that the 
organization's main problem is the partial fulfillment of 51 
percent of its 796 recommendations, 103 of which are due to a 
"negligent" attitude. He emphasized that "we do not count on 
the decided support of all the governors or the judges," in the 
struggle against torture, adding that in 34 penal institutions 
there is a lack of "courage and willingness" to put an end to 
corruption, drug trafficking, and self-governing groups inside 
penitentiaries. 
  During the presentation of his annual report, the ombudsman 
indicated that when the time comes, he will speak out about the 
46 complaints he has filed on the Chiapas conflict, "without 
attempting to harm the institutions." On Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
murder, he emphasized that the CHDH mission is not to cover up 
criminals nor to hide arbitrary actions, it is simply to foster 
respect for the Constitution. 
  Madrazo Cuellar reiterated that Mexico has the largest human 
rights organization in the world, however, what it seeks is to 
become the most efficient. To achieve this, he emphasized, it is 
indispensable, among other things, for the governors to 
reinforce their support to the local commissions so that these 
can efficiently fulfill their duty. Several of these 
commissions, he warned, face "severe financial problems," as 
well as a lack of technical and human resources, such as the 
case of Oaxaca. 
  During the reporting period, the Nonjurisdictional National 
System of Human Rights' Protection received 24,096 complaints; 
of these, the CNDH attended to 8,804. This represents an 
average of 24.1 per day. He added that in four years, 27,841 
charges have been presented, of which 26,393 have been 
investigated. He reported that the CNDH's current capacity to 
act is 94.8 percent. 
  In this regard, he emphasized that based on a socioeconomic 
study of victims, it was established that 70 percent are people 
of very low income. He said: "It is very satisfactory that the 
institution is giving support to those who have less and with 
whom we have the greatest justice." 
  He later indicated that the most frequent complaints concern 
violations of inmates' rights, abuse of authority, arbitrary 
detention, delays in legal action, denied access to medical 
services, false accusations, denials of the right to petition, 
public service responsibilities, and torture. 
  With regard to this last complaint, he emphasized that the 
accusations are decreasing; last year only 141 complaints were 
filed. Nevertheless, he explained that he had not received 
support from some governors and judges. With regard to the 
governors, "suffice it to say that one fourth of the federal 
institutions in the country still use torture as a form of 
punishment and much less have laws to prevent or to punish it." 
  With regard to judges, based on the CNDH's recommendations 
made during the reporting period, there are 53 cases of torture 
or homicide awaiting trial. He mentioned that only six of these 
cases have resulted in prison sentences; however, 26 denials or 
cancellations of arrest warrants have been issued. In seven 
cases, sentences have not yet been handed down; in 13 cases, 
arrest warrants have been issued; and one release resolution was 
issued. 
  Meanwhile, the CNDH president indicated that the authorities 
most willing to resolve the complaints through mutual, friendly 
agreement are the Attorney General's Office and the justice 
prosecutor of Mexico City, the Secretariat General of Protection 
and Viability, the Security and Social Services Institute for 
Government Workers, and the Department of the Federal District. 
  Madrazo Cuellar indicated that the current status of the 267 
recommendations issued this year are as follows: 49 have been 
totally complied with, 196 have been only partially complied 
with, 12 have been accepted and are waiting for evidence to be 
presented, three have been accepted without evidence, 22 are 
pending a response, and seven have not been accepted by the 
officials involved. 
  In discussing this matter further, he reported that these 
cases involve the head of Santiago Ixcuintla Municipality in 
Nayarit, the governors of Aguascalientes and Baja California, 
the head of Sinaloa State's Higher Court of Justice, the 
agrarian reform secretary, and the trust fund manager of the 
National Low-Income Housing Fund. The previous Oaxaca 
legislature also is included in this list, the CNDH official 
indicated, because it knowingly let time elapse despite having 
accepted the recommendations. "This is scandalous behavior 
devoid of any ethical basis," Madrazo Cuellar noted. 
  Of the 796 recommendations issued in four years, Madrazo 
Cuellar noted that 376 were fully complied with and 404 
partially complied with; three were accepted, but there is no 
evidence of compliance; and two were unsatisfactorily complied 
with. Also, 12 are at the stage of submitting evidence; there 
is still time to reply to 22; and 16 were not accepted. 
  In addition, he noted that 101 of the 404 recommendations 
that were partially fulfilled fall under this category because 
the arrest warrants have not been enforced, or, in some cases, 
even issued by the judges. The CNDH, he added, knows that 426 
arrest warrants issued on the basis of its suggestions and which 
correspond to federal or local jurisdictions have not been 
complied with or issued. 
  Also, 145 recommendations that have been partially complied 
with deal with prison matters. In order for these to be fully 
enforced, many need the allocation of financial resources to 
build, expand, or repair prisons -- "something that takes time, 
of course." The CNDH chairman explained that a lack of courage 
or commitment to stamp out corruption, drug trafficking, and the 
persistence of self-governing groups is noticeable in 34 cases. 
  Later, when referring to 103 recommendations that were 
partially heeded, he noted that, based on the dates on which 
they were issued and the records contained in the respective 
files, they must be regarded as cases in which there has been 
"negligent noncompliance." 
  He enumerated the recommendations falling under this 
category 
that were sent to different governors: 15 to the Oaxaca 
governor, 13 to the Michoacan governor, nine to the Guerrero 
governor, eight to the Mexico State governor, six to the 
Chihuahua governor, five to the Morelos governor, five to the 
Puebla governor, four to the San Luis Potosi governor, three to 
the Baja California governor, three to the Chiapas governor, 
three to the Guanajuato governor, three to the Sonora governor, 
three to the Tamaulipas governor, two to the Colima governor, 
two to the Durango governor, two to the Tabasco governor, two to 
the Yucatan governor, one to the Aguascalientes governor, one to 
the Jalisco governor, one to the Nayarit governor, one to the 
Nuevo Leon governor, and one to the Tlaxcala governor. One was 
also sent to the agrarian reform secretary. 
  He warned that the recipients "must be aware that each case 
is a complaint for an act of injustice, arbitrariness, impunity, 
and it is in their hands to resolve these cases and make 
amends.... Whoever has the authority to resolve an act of 
injustice and fails to do so becomes an accomplice of the 
perpetrator." 
  During the period mentioned in the report -- from May 1993 
to 
May 1994 -- more than 539 public officials -- 330 federal and 
209 state employees -- were punished, but since the CNDH has 
been functioning, a total of 1,848 officials were subject to 
disciplinary actions. He affirmed that in the struggle against 
impunity there can be no exceptions. 
  After recounting the CNDH activities -- contained in a total 
of 5,083 pages, which he summarized in 14 pages -- Madrazo 
Cuellar noted that the armed conflict in Chiapas represents the 
most important challenge for his organization. He added: "We 
are working in an objective and impartial manner in conducting 
the investigations and collecting evidence, because without 
these efforts we could not make pronouncements. We are working 
to rectify errors and to make amends for violations perpetrated 
by those who disobey orders, and we are doing this without 
seeking to harm any institutions." 
  Regarding the complaint filed by the Mayorals, who were 
coimplicated in Colosio's murder, he said the CNDH will maintain 
the opinion that the perpetrators of the most serious offenses 
are entitled to their individual rights, but society "must not 
become confused." He added, "Just as all Mexicans, the CNDH 
wants the whole truth to be known and those responsible to bear 
the full weight of the law" for the "deplorable homicide." 
  The CNDH's mission, he added, is to enforce respect for the 
law at all times, even during the most difficult and painful 
moments, under the terms of the Constitution.

  [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- The Mexicali industrial 
zone, situated at the border of the United States and Mexico, 
wants more Taiwan investment, a representative of the zone said 
Saturday [11 June]. 
  Investors will be allowed easier access to the North 
American 
Free Trade Area (NAFTA) [as received] after setting up plants 
there, Chuang Chih-lung, an overseas Chinese authorized by the 
zone to court Taiwan investment, said Saturday. 
  Chuang made the call for more Taiwan investment in the wake 
of Republic of China Premier Lien Chan's visit to Mexico last 
week. The only Taiwan companies currently operating in the 
industrial zone are computer makers, Chuang said. 
  Most of the investors in the zone, which encompasses a 
population of a million people, come from the United States, 
Japan, and Taiwan, Chuang noted. He said the low cost of rent 
in the zone and the cheap and abundant labor force there make it 
an ideal place for Taiwan investors wanting to break into the 
North American market.

<F P=106> [Report by Mireya Cuellar and Raul Llanos] </F>
  [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos is reportedly ahead of 
Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party [PRI] by only 5 percent of the vote in the race for the 
Presidency of the republic, according to two recent polls, one 
conducted by the Opinion Research Center (CEO) and the 
University of Guadalajara and the other by the Indemerc-Louis 
Harris Firm. 
  The CEO conducted its poll among 6,896 voters in 19 cities 
of 
the republic. The results show that, as of 28 May, Fernandez de 
Cevallos had 33.2 percent of the votes, Zedillo 28.1 percent, 
and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 13 percent. 
  The poll conducted by the private Endemerc-Louis Harris Firm 
on 24-31 May among 600 people in the valley of Mexico shows that 
PAN [National Action Party] candidate Fernandez de Cevallos 
increased his popularity rating to 42 percent after the 
presidential debate. The PRI candidate placed second with 37 
percent followed by Cardenas, candidate of the PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution], with 9 percent. 
  The CEO poll, which has a statistical reliability rating of 
94.2 percent, was conducted on 19-18 May, and the 19 chosen 
cities make up 36 percent of the national electorate. The 
criteria used to select the sample of voters included sex, age, 
and area of residence. The people were approached on the 
streets. 
  The CEO poll shows that trust in the Federal Electoral 
Institute (IFE), which is tasked with overseeing the process, 
increased slightly. When asked how trustworthy the IFE is in 
their opinion, 38.8 percent answered that it is trustworthy and 
35.6 said that "it is not trustworthy." The first CEO poll 
conducted in March showed that 37.3 percent questioned the IFE's 
trustworthiness and 34.3 percent said it was trustworthy. 
  According to this poll, although more than 30 percent of 
citizens trust the IFE, only 27 percent think the elections will 
be "clean and honest." When asked whether they think the 
upcoming presidential elections will be clean and honest, 41.1 
percent replied "no" and 31.9 percent said they do not know. 
  Another interesting fact revealed by the CEO poll is that 
61.9 percent of the population thinks the parties will reject 
the electoral results, only 33 percent think they will accept 
them, and the rest do not know. 
  If the elections had been held during the last 10 days of 
May, that is, after the debate, Fernandez de Cevallos would 
reportedly be the next president of Mexico with 33.2 percent of 
the vote. Very closely behind was Zedillo with 28.1 percent and 
Cardenas with 13 percent of the vote. 
  The CEO conducted its first poll on 16-22 March this year. 
In that poll, 45.8 percent of the voters supported Zedillo, 
13.5 percent Fernandez de Cevallos, and 18.1 percent Cardenas. 
The second and most recent poll was carried out on 19-28 May, 
amid the debate, and by then the PRI and PRD candidates had lost 
popularity. 
  CEO Director Cesar Augusto Morones Servin stated that his 
second and most recent poll makes two things clear: the 21 
August election will be "strongly disputed" and the statistical 
forecasts are very "vulnerable." Any major development between 
now and the elections could alter the voting. 
  To back his "work theory," Morones Servin, during the same 
news conference in which he reported the results of the CEO poll 
yesterday, said they conducted a poll in Guadalajara two days 
after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, showing that 
PRI popularity had increased from 45.8 to 65 percent. The 
assassination favored the official party. 
  The PRI popularity rate, however, had dropped to 35 percent 
one month after Colosio's death. The analyst attributed this to 
the confusion created by the incident. In fact, 30 percent of 
those polled in Guadalajara said they think that the 
assassination was plotted within the official party. 
  The CEO director said the poll yielded a large amount of 
additional information that the University of Guadalajara places 
at the disposal of not only the media but also political 
organizations and the public at large. 
  Morones Servin said the cost of the poll was 80,000 new 
pesos, thanks to the support of 19 public universities 
throughout the country, which collected information in their 
states at no charge. On the market, this poll would cost 1.5 
billion old pesos. 
  The cities where information was collected are: Mexico, 
Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa, 
Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, 
Puebla, Merida, Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Tampico, Leon and Tapachula. 
<H5>  Indemerc: Diego grows </H5>
  According to a recent poll conducted by the Indemerc-Louis 
Harris firm with a representative sample of 600 Valley of Mexico 
residents, support for Fernandez de Cevallos began to rise after 
the public debate and as of 31 May he garnered the support of 42 
percent of the respondents. 
  Following him very closely is the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo 
Ponce 
de Leon who, according to the poll, has the support of 37 
percent of residents in the Valley of Mexico, one of the areas 
with the largest number of voters in the country. 
  The poll in question, which is part of the weekly follow-up 
conducted by Indemerc-Louis Harris, shows that support for the 
former secretary of programming and budget began to drop in the 
second week of May, days after the televised public debate 
between the PRI, PAN and PRD candidates. 
  As for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), he received the 
support of 9 percent of the voters in central Mexico. 
  Support for Cardenas Solorzano has remained steady following 
the aforementioned debate, although according to polls conducted 
a few days ago there has been a significant surge of support for 
the PRD, which is gradually closing the gap that separates 
Cardenas from his two main contenders as 21 August approaches. 
  As for the six other political parties that will participate 
in the electoral process, the polls underscore that together 
they gathered the support of 12 percent of the electorate. 
  Nevertheless, Indemerc-Louis Harris President Vicente Licona 
said that most of this support has gone to Labor Party (PT) 
candidate Cecilia Soto, while support for the remaining 
contenders in this group has shown little or no change. 
  The Indemerc-Louis Harris poll shows the trend of the three 
leading contenders' campaigns before and after the public debate. 
  Thus, for example, starting in April support for the PRI 
declined significantly. By then, Ernesto Zedillo had been 
uncovered as the candidate who would succeed Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, slain in Tijuana on 23 March. 
  According to the poll, popular support for the PRI had 
stopped dropping up to the day after the televised debate 
between Zedillo, Diego Fernandez and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. After 
the debate, the party regained some support which, nevertheless, 
has proven insufficient to restore it to the levels of support 
it enjoyed up until April. 
  Meanwhile, the PAN made steady progress prior to the debate. 
As of that date, 12 May, Diego Fernandez' "bonds" multiplied 
"like bubbles" and he gained the support of 50 percent of Valley 
of Mexico residents. Nevertheless, the white and blue party 
candidate's popularity has decreased slightly due to matters 
pertaining to his choice of words during his political campaign. 
As of 31 May, Fernandez de Cevallos maintained the support of 
42 percent of the voters in the heart of the nation. 
  To conclude, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' position has remained 
steady among Valley of Mexico voters, and although he did not 
"win" the debate, his popularity has not been significantly 
affected.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 9 
June. 
  The National Institute of Statistics, INE, has reported that 
the inflation rate totaled 2.76 percent in May. The consumer 
price index totals 14.7 percent after the first five months of 
the year, which represents a 6.9 percent reduction as compared 
with its position in May 1993. According to INE data, clothes 
and shoe prices accounted for the largest increase, namely 6 
percent, while education accounted for the lowest increase of 
0.5 percent. (Montevideo LA MANANA in Spanish 2 Jun 94 p 3) 
  UTE, General Administration of State Electric Power and 
Telephones, sources have told EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO that the 
UTE board of directors has approved a 6.5 percent average 
increase in UTE rates as of 1 June. UTE rates are increased 
every two months. According to UTE estimates, UTE rates have 
declined, in real terms, by 33 percent between March 1990 and 
December 1993. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 2 
Jun 94 p 8) 
  Stock Exchange operations declined by 34.3 percent in May as 
compared with May 1993. May operations, which totaled $38.2 
million, were 22.3 percent under those reported for April. 
During the first five months, stock exchange operations totaled 
$212.4 million, which represents a 23 percent decline as 
compared with operations for the same period last year.

  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez has admitted 
in London, without providing details, Venezuela is holding talks 
with the IMF, but he has explained his country has yet to 
request a "standby" [previous word published in English] 
agreement. 
  During his visit to London, Sosa seized the opportunity to 
meet with representatives of the British private and public 
sectors, as well as with the media, in what could be considered 
an instructive offensive aimed at projecting a clearer image of 
the country's prevailing situation. 
  He announced IMF President Michael Camdessus will visit 
Venezuela in late June, adding the country has enough reserves 
to pay for 11 months worth of imports and to meet foreign debt 
obligations. 
  During his meeting with media representatives, Sosa not only 
delineated the economic measures the country is taking; he also 
listened to and answered questions, stressing "the distortions 
that can be made due to a lack of information and preconceived 
notions." He left the doors open for future consultations. 
  The finance minister added: "The possibility that Venezuela 
has to achieve self-sustained economic growth requires time, 
despite good intentions and determination; this time must be 
used to invest in political stability and social justice." 
  Sosa also reported the British company Baywater will sign an 
agreement with the Venezuelan Government to repair the 
metropolitan aqueduct, which will not only regulate the water 
supply to Caracas but will also constitute a large boost for the 
"Venezuela Project," through which the British private sector 
will invest more than $2 billion in the country.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said he is willing to 
mediate between Cuba and the United States to eliminate the 
economic embargo on the island, however, "no one has asked us to 
mediate, and we are not in the habit of going where we have not 
been invited." In a short news conference, shortly before 
leaving for Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Salinas de Gortari 
said he is convinced the blockade solves nothing and added: "we 
believe it should be lifted and in this manner bridges for 
communication and dialogue would be built." [passage omitted] 
  The Mexican president said the visit was "very positive and 
cordial and strengthened the traditional good relations that 
exist between our two countries." [passage omitted]
