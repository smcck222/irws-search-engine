  [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba's ambassador 
to Mexico Abelardo Curbelo has said that the visit Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Cuba Monday "is 
an expression of a political nature." 
  In an interview with NOTIMEX, the diplomat did not rule out 
the possibility of some cooperation agreement, which may include 
the oil sector, being signed as part of the Mexican president's 
activities during his six-hour visit to the island. 
  The diplomat said: "The essence of (Salinas') meeting with 
Fidel Castro is to increase the ties of friendship that exist 
between the two countries in all fields." 
  Curbelo added: "This minisummit is an expression of a 
political, not economic nature, but I will not deny that some 
kind of cooperation agreements, such as the one Mexpetrol 
negotiated with Cuban firms to send Mexican crude oil to the 
Cuban refinery, could be signed." 
  Curbelo explained that the negotiations process between a 
Cuban firm and Mexpetrol, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum, was 
reached between the two enterprises, without government 
participation. 
  The diplomat said Cuba and Mexico are continuing 
negotiations 
in sectors such as telephone, tourism, and others "about which 
we prefer not to talk and which we keep quiet about in order not 
to obstruct them." 
  Curbelo said the Cuban Government permits the participation 
of foreign capital -- from Mexico as well as from other 
countries -- and agreements do not depend on the presidential 
visit or official events because the agreements are among 
enterprises themselves. 
  The ambassador noted: This is why the signing of agreements 
do not depend on a deadline or a meeting. If we find that an 
agreement can be signed Monday, however, it will be done in a 
symbolic way. 
  Curbelo explained that Cuba is seeking oil agreements with 
various nations to stabilize oil supplies "based on market 
conditions and not on preferential price treatment, which is not 
our objective right now." 
  He said plans for securing stable oil supplies must be based 
on the Cuban economy's capacity and efficiency within the 
framework of world market conditions. "These are our 
objectives," he said. 
  If preferential prices are granted, he explained, this will 
depend on the other countries, on the possibility of them buying 
Cuban products, and on Cuba's export capabilities. 
  President Salinas will visit Cuba Monday. He will stay there 
six hours and review the bilateral agenda and issues of common 
interest with Fidel Castro. 
  President Salinas will attend a dinner hosted by Castro, and 
later he will travel to Colombia where he will participate in 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will be attended by the 
presidents or heads of state of Spain, Portugal, and 21 Latin 
American countries.

<F P=106> [Report by Gabriela Resendez from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] At Los Pinos presidential residence, President 
Salinas has announced that 80,000 Mexican teachers will be 
guaranteed access to credits to purchase homes in the coming two 
years. President Salinas affirmed the signing of the agreement 
to finance a housing program for teachers. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] As I have said here, 80,000 loans, 
which will be financed with some 3.900 billion new pesos, will 
be granted to teachers in the coming 24 months. The federal 
government, the state governments, and the national banking 
system will grant these funds. [end recording] 
  This credit agreement came into force on 8 June and was 
signed by Elba Ester Gordillo, secretary general of the National 
Coordinating Board of Education Workers; Jose Madariaga Lomeli, 
vice president of the Mexican Banking Association; and Jose 
Angel Pescador Osuna, education secretary. Pescador noted that 
the CEPA [expansion unknown] contributed 72 million new pesos to 
the program. Later, in the Avila Camacho Hall, President 
Salinas announced reductions in the prices of agricultural tools 
and tractors of up to a 160 horsepower. These reductions seek 
to strengthen the capitalization of the Mexican agricultural 
sector. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Reductions in the price of these 
basic agricultural tools range from a minimum of 33 percent to 
discounts of more than 40 percent. [end recording] 
  President Salinas said these discounts entered into effect 
on 
8 June, and announced that credit packages are available to 
enable farmers to buy the equipment promptly. President Salinas 
also noted the production results for the Fall-Winter period: 
over 4 million tons of corn, over 3.5 million tons of wheat, and 
over 350,000 tons of beans. These figures, he added, surpass 
previous averages.

  [Text] Guadalajara, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The explosion of a 
car bomb today at a Guadalajara hotel was, apparently, the work 
of individuals involved in drug trafficking, according to the 
preliminary reports released today by Jalisco State authorities. 
  A car bomb exploded at dawn on Saturday in the capital of 
Jalisco in western Mexico, causing two deaths and injuring five 
people, according to the Office of the State District Attorney 
(PGJE). 
  In a communique, the PGJE explained that the explosion took 
place during a birthday party at the hotel, which was attended 
by "families that may be related to the family of Rafael Caro 
Quintero." 
  Drug traffickers Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca 
alias "Don Neto" are serving prison sentences for their 
involvement in the 1985 murder of U.S. DEA agent Enrique 
Camarena. 
  According to a document released by the Jalisco authorities, 
cards were found at the tables with the names of the following 
families: the Quintero Echeverria Family, the Perez Quintero 
Family, and the Hernandez Quintero Family. 
  The PGJE said "the 15th Military Zone, Attorney General's 
Office (PGR) and PGJE are conducting a joint investigation." 
Based on the testimony of a witness, the authorities 
established the sequence of events prior to the explosion. 
  According to Arturo Rangel Martinez (who was injured by the 
explosion), at 0200 local time (0800 GMT), he was in the bus 
owned by the music group "The Hurricanes of the North," for 
which he drives. 
  Rangel Martinez testified that he noticed "a parked Ford 
Grand Marquis, which was approached by a young man wearing a 
dark suit." According to the PGJE communique, Rangel Martinez 
said that "approximately five minutes later, while he was 
resting inside the bus, he heard and felt an explosion and saw 
that the vehicle had exploded." 
  According to preliminary reports, the PGJE noted, it was 
possible to determine that "the vehicle that exploded had 
apparently been stolen and bore a superimposed license plate 
because, according to records, the plates belonged to another 
vehicle." The explosion damaged the bus owned by the musicians 
who played at the party, and eight other vehicles. 
  The PGJE bulletin explained that the party, in honor of 
Karine Fernandez Castro who turned 15, was attended by 
approximately 200 guests, most of whom came from the northern 
Sinaloa State, one of the states that has the largest number of 
drug trafficking gangs. 
  The car bomb explosion follows the 7 June attempt by an 
armed 
group -- which subsequently confronted policemen -- to murder 
Leonel Quintero Payan, a relative of Caro Quintero, in 
Guadalajara. 
  There was also an incident on 10 June when drug agents 
prevented five armed individuals from kidnapping Leonel Quintero 
Payan, who had been wounded in the attack and was being treated 
at the Del Carmen hospital in this city. 
  "According to forensic investigations conducted so far on 
the 
bodies found at the site of the explosion, it is presumed that 
they are the bodies of two men" whose identities were not 
disclosed by the authorities. The authorities have also 
disclosed that "of the five people hurt in the explosion, four 
of them suffered only slight injuries."

  [Excerpt] Mr. Ernesto Zedillo, Mexican presidential 
candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], 
speaking before the Mexican medical community, condemned the 
Guadalajara, Jalisco State car bomb attack. 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] Anonymous violence is one of the 
most brutal criminal actions; it attacks Mexican society's most 
appreciated values and must be strongly rejected. We demand 
that the circumstances regarding this crime be clarified and 
that those responsible receive harsh punishment. We Mexicans 
want to live safely, with tranquillity, and with unity. 
Criminal forces must not be allowed to disturb our country's 
social peace. [end recording] 
  The PRI candidate sent a message of solidarity to the people 
of Guadalajara: 
  [Begin Zedillo recording] Once again, Guadalajara and all 
Jalisco residents suffer events that have absolutely nothing to 
do with these civic-minded and hard-working people. We join 
them in their demands for justice. [end recording] [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Francisco Gomez Maza] </F>
  [Text] Division General Ramon Mota Sanchez, chairman of the 
Chamber of Deputies Defense Commission, said arms trafficking in 
the country "is nothing serious; it is a normal occurrence as it 
is in all countries of the world. It is small-scale smuggling." 
  Mota downplayed the importance of weapons trafficking, 
saying 
he did not believe it was serious but, rather, just "something 
normal, as it is in all countries of the world into which many 
types of articles, such as food or clothing, are smuggled. 
Weapons are also smuggled in, but this is something that has 
always existed, and all countries take measures to try to stop 
it." He said there have been no indicators leading one to 
believe there has been some truly heavy weapons trafficking; 
"there has been just the normal amount, the amount that has 
always existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it." 
  Shortly before attending yesterday's meeting of the recently 
created Consultative and Social Participation Commission of 
Civil Protection at the Government Secretariat, the division 
general, who is also a deputy, confirmed "the weapons smuggling 
that exists (in the country) is on a small scale. It is the 
common smuggling that exists in all countries that share 
borders, and there is no need for alarm or anything." When 
questioned on the front steps of the Government Secretariat at 
approximately 1100, the following questions and answers ensued: 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Is the Chamber of Deputies Defense 
Commission 
conducting any investigation into the recent reports there is a 
trafficking of large amounts of weapons? 
  [Mota] The commission has nothing to do with that. The 
corresponding authorities are the ones who have presented the 
reports, and they are probably conducting investigations, which 
they do on a permanent basis. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] How serious is weapons trafficking? 
  [Mota] I do not believe it is serious. I believe it is 
something normal, as it is in all countries of the world where 
there is arms trafficking, and many types of articles, such as 
food, clothing, and so forth, are smuggled in. Weapons are also 
smuggled in, but this is something that has always existed, and 
all countries take measures to try to stop it. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Our society, then, should not be worried 
about weapons trafficking? 
  [Mota] I do not believe so because the information (which 
was 
leaked about a possible heavy trafficking of weapons and which 
authorities are investigating) is from February. From February 
to the present, there has been no event, no indicator that would 
lead one to believe there has been some truly heavy weapons 
trafficking, just the normal amount, the amount that has always 
existed, the small-scale smuggling, as we call it. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Who generally engages in trafficking? 
  [Mota] All types of people who travel, especially, to the 
United States and return with some type of weapon. This is why 
I call it small scale. 
  [EL FINANCIERO] Do you have any statistics to report on arms 
seizures? 
  [Mota] The Defense and Government Secretariats have just 
published this report. I do not have the figures on hand, but 
they are significant, especially those on drug trafficking. 
  The civil protection programs of the Government Secretariat, 
which is headed by Government Under Secretary Socorro Diaz 
Palacios, were analyzed at the meeting Mota attended. 
  People from various sectors that form part of the National 
Council of Civil Protection also attended this meeting. The 
objective of this council is to provide elements of analysis to 
the Government Secretariat so that its civil protection 
activities will reach more people.

<F P=106> [Report by Angel Porras Robles] </F>
  [Text] Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National 
Human Rights Commission [CNDH], acknowledged to the head of the 
executive branch, President Salinas de Gortari, that the 
organization's main problem is the partial fulfillment of 51 
percent of its 796 recommendations, 103 of which are due to a 
"negligent" attitude. He emphasized that "we do not count on 
the decided support of all the governors or the judges," in the 
struggle against torture, adding that in 34 penal institutions 
there is a lack of "courage and willingness" to put an end to 
corruption, drug trafficking, and self-governing groups inside 
penitentiaries. 
  During the presentation of his annual report, the ombudsman 
indicated that when the time comes, he will speak out about the 
46 complaints he has filed on the Chiapas conflict, "without 
attempting to harm the institutions." On Luis Donaldo Colosio's 
murder, he emphasized that the CHDH mission is not to cover up 
criminals nor to hide arbitrary actions, it is simply to foster 
respect for the Constitution. 
  Madrazo Cuellar reiterated that Mexico has the largest human 
rights organization in the world, however, what it seeks is to 
become the most efficient. To achieve this, he emphasized, it is 
indispensable, among other things, for the governors to 
reinforce their support to the local commissions so that these 
can efficiently fulfill their duty. Several of these 
commissions, he warned, face "severe financial problems," as 
well as a lack of technical and human resources, such as the 
case of Oaxaca. 
  During the reporting period, the Nonjurisdictional National 
System of Human Rights' Protection received 24,096 complaints; 
of these, the CNDH attended to 8,804. This represents an 
average of 24.1 per day. He added that in four years, 27,841 
charges have been presented, of which 26,393 have been 
investigated. He reported that the CNDH's current capacity to 
act is 94.8 percent. 
  In this regard, he emphasized that based on a socioeconomic 
study of victims, it was established that 70 percent are people 
of very low income. He said: "It is very satisfactory that the 
institution is giving support to those who have less and with 
whom we have the greatest justice." 
  He later indicated that the most frequent complaints concern 
violations of inmates' rights, abuse of authority, arbitrary 
detention, delays in legal action, denied access to medical 
services, false accusations, denials of the right to petition, 
public service responsibilities, and torture. 
  With regard to this last complaint, he emphasized that the 
accusations are decreasing; last year only 141 complaints were 
filed. Nevertheless, he explained that he had not received 
support from some governors and judges. With regard to the 
governors, "suffice it to say that one fourth of the federal 
institutions in the country still use torture as a form of 
punishment and much less have laws to prevent or to punish it." 
  With regard to judges, based on the CNDH's recommendations 
made during the reporting period, there are 53 cases of torture 
or homicide awaiting trial. He mentioned that only six of these 
cases have resulted in prison sentences; however, 26 denials or 
cancellations of arrest warrants have been issued. In seven 
cases, sentences have not yet been handed down; in 13 cases, 
arrest warrants have been issued; and one release resolution was 
issued. 
  Meanwhile, the CNDH president indicated that the authorities 
most willing to resolve the complaints through mutual, friendly 
agreement are the Attorney General's Office and the justice 
prosecutor of Mexico City, the Secretariat General of Protection 
and Viability, the Security and Social Services Institute for 
Government Workers, and the Department of the Federal District. 
  Madrazo Cuellar indicated that the current status of the 267 
recommendations issued this year are as follows: 49 have been 
totally complied with, 196 have been only partially complied 
with, 12 have been accepted and are waiting for evidence to be 
presented, three have been accepted without evidence, 22 are 
pending a response, and seven have not been accepted by the 
officials involved. 
  In discussing this matter further, he reported that these 
cases involve the head of Santiago Ixcuintla Municipality in 
Nayarit, the governors of Aguascalientes and Baja California, 
the head of Sinaloa State's Higher Court of Justice, the 
agrarian reform secretary, and the trust fund manager of the 
National Low-Income Housing Fund. The previous Oaxaca 
legislature also is included in this list, the CNDH official 
indicated, because it knowingly let time elapse despite having 
accepted the recommendations. "This is scandalous behavior 
devoid of any ethical basis," Madrazo Cuellar noted. 
  Of the 796 recommendations issued in four years, Madrazo 
Cuellar noted that 376 were fully complied with and 404 
partially complied with; three were accepted, but there is no 
evidence of compliance; and two were unsatisfactorily complied 
with. Also, 12 are at the stage of submitting evidence; there 
is still time to reply to 22; and 16 were not accepted. 
  In addition, he noted that 101 of the 404 recommendations 
that were partially fulfilled fall under this category because 
the arrest warrants have not been enforced, or, in some cases, 
even issued by the judges. The CNDH, he added, knows that 426 
arrest warrants issued on the basis of its suggestions and which 
correspond to federal or local jurisdictions have not been 
complied with or issued. 
  Also, 145 recommendations that have been partially complied 
with deal with prison matters. In order for these to be fully 
enforced, many need the allocation of financial resources to 
build, expand, or repair prisons -- "something that takes time, 
of course." The CNDH chairman explained that a lack of courage 
or commitment to stamp out corruption, drug trafficking, and the 
persistence of self-governing groups is noticeable in 34 cases. 
  Later, when referring to 103 recommendations that were 
partially heeded, he noted that, based on the dates on which 
they were issued and the records contained in the respective 
files, they must be regarded as cases in which there has been 
"negligent noncompliance." 
  He enumerated the recommendations falling under this 
category 
that were sent to different governors: 15 to the Oaxaca 
governor, 13 to the Michoacan governor, nine to the Guerrero 
governor, eight to the Mexico State governor, six to the 
Chihuahua governor, five to the Morelos governor, five to the 
Puebla governor, four to the San Luis Potosi governor, three to 
the Baja California governor, three to the Chiapas governor, 
three to the Guanajuato governor, three to the Sonora governor, 
three to the Tamaulipas governor, two to the Colima governor, 
two to the Durango governor, two to the Tabasco governor, two to 
the Yucatan governor, one to the Aguascalientes governor, one to 
the Jalisco governor, one to the Nayarit governor, one to the 
Nuevo Leon governor, and one to the Tlaxcala governor. One was 
also sent to the agrarian reform secretary. 
  He warned that the recipients "must be aware that each case 
is a complaint for an act of injustice, arbitrariness, impunity, 
and it is in their hands to resolve these cases and make 
amends.... Whoever has the authority to resolve an act of 
injustice and fails to do so becomes an accomplice of the 
perpetrator." 
  During the period mentioned in the report -- from May 1993 
to 
May 1994 -- more than 539 public officials -- 330 federal and 
209 state employees -- were punished, but since the CNDH has 
been functioning, a total of 1,848 officials were subject to 
disciplinary actions. He affirmed that in the struggle against 
impunity there can be no exceptions. 
  After recounting the CNDH activities -- contained in a total 
of 5,083 pages, which he summarized in 14 pages -- Madrazo 
Cuellar noted that the armed conflict in Chiapas represents the 
most important challenge for his organization. He added: "We 
are working in an objective and impartial manner in conducting 
the investigations and collecting evidence, because without 
these efforts we could not make pronouncements. We are working 
to rectify errors and to make amends for violations perpetrated 
by those who disobey orders, and we are doing this without 
seeking to harm any institutions." 
  Regarding the complaint filed by the Mayorals, who were 
coimplicated in Colosio's murder, he said the CNDH will maintain 
the opinion that the perpetrators of the most serious offenses 
are entitled to their individual rights, but society "must not 
become confused." He added, "Just as all Mexicans, the CNDH 
wants the whole truth to be known and those responsible to bear 
the full weight of the law" for the "deplorable homicide." 
  The CNDH's mission, he added, is to enforce respect for the 
law at all times, even during the most difficult and painful 
moments, under the terms of the Constitution.

  [Text] Taipei, June 11 (CNA) -- The Mexicali industrial 
zone, situated at the border of the United States and Mexico, 
wants more Taiwan investment, a representative of the zone said 
Saturday [11 June]. 
  Investors will be allowed easier access to the North 
American 
Free Trade Area (NAFTA) [as received] after setting up plants 
there, Chuang Chih-lung, an overseas Chinese authorized by the 
zone to court Taiwan investment, said Saturday. 
  Chuang made the call for more Taiwan investment in the wake 
of Republic of China Premier Lien Chan's visit to Mexico last 
week. The only Taiwan companies currently operating in the 
industrial zone are computer makers, Chuang said. 
  Most of the investors in the zone, which encompasses a 
population of a million people, come from the United States, 
Japan, and Taiwan, Chuang noted. He said the low cost of rent 
in the zone and the cheap and abundant labor force there make it 
an ideal place for Taiwan investors wanting to break into the 
North American market.

<F P=106> [Report by Mireya Cuellar and Raul Llanos] </F>
  [Text] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos is reportedly ahead of 
Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary 
Party [PRI] by only 5 percent of the vote in the race for the 
Presidency of the republic, according to two recent polls, one 
conducted by the Opinion Research Center (CEO) and the 
University of Guadalajara and the other by the Indemerc-Louis 
Harris Firm. 
  The CEO conducted its poll among 6,896 voters in 19 cities 
of 
the republic. The results show that, as of 28 May, Fernandez de 
Cevallos had 33.2 percent of the votes, Zedillo 28.1 percent, 
and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas 13 percent. 
  The poll conducted by the private Endemerc-Louis Harris Firm 
on 24-31 May among 600 people in the valley of Mexico shows that 
PAN [National Action Party] candidate Fernandez de Cevallos 
increased his popularity rating to 42 percent after the 
presidential debate. The PRI candidate placed second with 37 
percent followed by Cardenas, candidate of the PRD [Party of the 
Democratic Revolution], with 9 percent. 
  The CEO poll, which has a statistical reliability rating of 
94.2 percent, was conducted on 19-18 May, and the 19 chosen 
cities make up 36 percent of the national electorate. The 
criteria used to select the sample of voters included sex, age, 
and area of residence. The people were approached on the 
streets. 
  The CEO poll shows that trust in the Federal Electoral 
Institute (IFE), which is tasked with overseeing the process, 
increased slightly. When asked how trustworthy the IFE is in 
their opinion, 38.8 percent answered that it is trustworthy and 
35.6 said that "it is not trustworthy." The first CEO poll 
conducted in March showed that 37.3 percent questioned the IFE's 
trustworthiness and 34.3 percent said it was trustworthy. 
  According to this poll, although more than 30 percent of 
citizens trust the IFE, only 27 percent think the elections will 
be "clean and honest." When asked whether they think the 
upcoming presidential elections will be clean and honest, 41.1 
percent replied "no" and 31.9 percent said they do not know. 
  Another interesting fact revealed by the CEO poll is that 
61.9 percent of the population thinks the parties will reject 
the electoral results, only 33 percent think they will accept 
them, and the rest do not know. 
  If the elections had been held during the last 10 days of 
May, that is, after the debate, Fernandez de Cevallos would 
reportedly be the next president of Mexico with 33.2 percent of 
the vote. Very closely behind was Zedillo with 28.1 percent and 
Cardenas with 13 percent of the vote. 
  The CEO conducted its first poll on 16-22 March this year. 
In that poll, 45.8 percent of the voters supported Zedillo, 
13.5 percent Fernandez de Cevallos, and 18.1 percent Cardenas. 
The second and most recent poll was carried out on 19-28 May, 
amid the debate, and by then the PRI and PRD candidates had lost 
popularity. 
  CEO Director Cesar Augusto Morones Servin stated that his 
second and most recent poll makes two things clear: the 21 
August election will be "strongly disputed" and the statistical 
forecasts are very "vulnerable." Any major development between 
now and the elections could alter the voting. 
  To back his "work theory," Morones Servin, during the same 
news conference in which he reported the results of the CEO poll 
yesterday, said they conducted a poll in Guadalajara two days 
after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, showing that 
PRI popularity had increased from 45.8 to 65 percent. The 
assassination favored the official party. 
  The PRI popularity rate, however, had dropped to 35 percent 
one month after Colosio's death. The analyst attributed this to 
the confusion created by the incident. In fact, 30 percent of 
those polled in Guadalajara said they think that the 
assassination was plotted within the official party. 
  The CEO director said the poll yielded a large amount of 
additional information that the University of Guadalajara places 
at the disposal of not only the media but also political 
organizations and the public at large. 
  Morones Servin said the cost of the poll was 80,000 new 
pesos, thanks to the support of 19 public universities 
throughout the country, which collected information in their 
states at no charge. On the market, this poll would cost 1.5 
billion old pesos. 
  The cities where information was collected are: Mexico, 
Guadalajara, Monterrey, Tijuana, Ciudad Juarez, Villahermosa, 
Hermosillo, Culiacan, Morelia, Veracruz, Acapulco, Torreon, 
Puebla, Merida, Chihuahua, Oaxaca, Tampico, Leon and Tapachula. 
<H5>  Indemerc: Diego grows </H5>
  According to a recent poll conducted by the Indemerc-Louis 
Harris firm with a representative sample of 600 Valley of Mexico 
residents, support for Fernandez de Cevallos began to rise after 
the public debate and as of 31 May he garnered the support of 42 
percent of the respondents. 
  Following him very closely is the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo 
Ponce 
de Leon who, according to the poll, has the support of 37 
percent of residents in the Valley of Mexico, one of the areas 
with the largest number of voters in the country. 
  The poll in question, which is part of the weekly follow-up 
conducted by Indemerc-Louis Harris, shows that support for the 
former secretary of programming and budget began to drop in the 
second week of May, days after the televised public debate 
between the PRI, PAN and PRD candidates. 
  As for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the 
Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), he received the 
support of 9 percent of the voters in central Mexico. 
  Support for Cardenas Solorzano has remained steady following 
the aforementioned debate, although according to polls conducted 
a few days ago there has been a significant surge of support for 
the PRD, which is gradually closing the gap that separates 
Cardenas from his two main contenders as 21 August approaches. 
  As for the six other political parties that will participate 
in the electoral process, the polls underscore that together 
they gathered the support of 12 percent of the electorate. 
  Nevertheless, Indemerc-Louis Harris President Vicente Licona 
said that most of this support has gone to Labor Party (PT) 
candidate Cecilia Soto, while support for the remaining 
contenders in this group has shown little or no change. 
  The Indemerc-Louis Harris poll shows the trend of the three 
leading contenders' campaigns before and after the public debate. 
  Thus, for example, starting in April support for the PRI 
declined significantly. By then, Ernesto Zedillo had been 
uncovered as the candidate who would succeed Luis 
Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, slain in Tijuana on 23 March. 
  According to the poll, popular support for the PRI had 
stopped dropping up to the day after the televised debate 
between Zedillo, Diego Fernandez and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. After 
the debate, the party regained some support which, nevertheless, 
has proven insufficient to restore it to the levels of support 
it enjoyed up until April. 
  Meanwhile, the PAN made steady progress prior to the debate. 
As of that date, 12 May, Diego Fernandez' "bonds" multiplied 
"like bubbles" and he gained the support of 50 percent of Valley 
of Mexico residents. Nevertheless, the white and blue party 
candidate's popularity has decreased slightly due to matters 
pertaining to his choice of words during his political campaign. 
As of 31 May, Fernandez de Cevallos maintained the support of 
42 percent of the voters in the heart of the nation. 
  To conclude, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' position has remained 
steady among Valley of Mexico voters, and although he did not 
"win" the debate, his popularity has not been significantly 
affected.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun -- Diplomatic sources have reported 
that early this morning a group of 16 Cubans used a truck to 
force their way into the German Embassy in Havana to seek 
political asylum. 
  The source reported that at 0915 GMT, the group, which 
includes women and children, crashed the truck in which they 
were traveling against the iron gate at the entrance of the 
embassy, opening it, and entering the diplomatic grounds, where 
they requested political asylum. 
  The German Embassy is in the Miramar neighborhood (in west 
Havana), a few hundred meters from the Belgian ambassador's 
residence, which has been occupied since 28 May by 118 Cubans 
who have requested political asylum to leave Cuba. 
  German Embassy officials consulted by telephone have refused 
to comment on the matter and have asked journalists to contact 
the German Foreign Relations Minister in Bonn. 
  [Paris AFP in Spanish at 1507 GMT on 13 June reports that a 
total of 21 Cubans -- three women and 18 men -- took refuge on 
Monday at the German Embassy in Havana, according to the German 
Foreign Ministry in Bonn.]

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry confirmed a group of people's forceful entry into the 
German Embassy in Havana and described the action as an "obvious 
provocation." 
  Miguel Alfonso, official spokesman of the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry, has told NOTIMEX: "We want to point out that this 
action has taken place on the very day the president of Mexico 
arrives in Havana and on the eve of the 4th Ibero-American 
summit." 
  The spokesman said the forceful entry of these people into 
the German Embassy "is additional evidence of the harmful 
results of the U.S. policy" of denying visas to those who 
request visas at the U.S. Interests Office here.

  [Text] Cuba has termed 20 people's entry into the German 
Embassy in Havana a provocation and an illegal act and carefully 
planned and executed to coincide with the Mexican president's 
arrival in Cuba and with the eve of the fourth Ibero-American 
summit. Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has confirmed 
for PRENSA LATINA that 17 men and three women illegally entered 
the Embassy by ramming a truck with Camaguey Province license 
plates into the Embassy's metal garage door. 
  This took place early on 13 June. German Ambassador Georg 
Trefftz reported the incident to Cuban authorities a few minutes 
later, summoning Foreign Ministry officials. Luis Garcia 
Peralta, deputy director of the Europe Directorate, [name and 
title as heard] showed up to represent the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry. The ambassador told him that the people occupying the 
Embassy refused to leave, even though he himself had asked them 
to leave immediately. Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso 
reiterated the well-known Cuban position of not approving the 
violation of a diplomatic mission accredited to Cuba as a means 
to supersede normal procedures to travel abroad.

<F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Rodriguez from Cartagena de Indias; </F>
from the "Caracol's Quarter Hour" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] The Ibero-American countries, through their foreign 
ministers, have already reached an agreement on the document for 
investment, development, and social adjustments as a means of 
moderating the summit's opening following the presentation of a 
harsh document by the CLAT, the Latin American Central 
Organization of Workers, which states that more than 200,000 
workers in Latin America have lost their jobs. 
  Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, at the conclusion of 
the second round of sessions with her Ibero-American colleagues, 
said the following: 
  [Begin recording] [Sanin] We have already reached an 
agreement on the final document. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What does it consist of? 
  [Sanin] Integration, trade, investment, and the parallel 
social-type processes that must be implemented. 
  [Reporter] [Words indistinct] what priority did it have? 
  [Sanin] It was not included on the agenda. 
  [Reporter] Did Spain and Portugal have a real commitment to 
represent Latin America at the EU? 
  [Sanin] They are the natural bridge to represent us at the 
EU. 
  [Reporter] Did they sign a written commitment? 
  [Sanin] Of course, since the first summit. 
  [Reporter] How would you describe the development of the 
summit so far? 
  [Sanin] Totally satisfactory. 
  [Reporter] Would Colombia support military intervention in 
Haiti? Would the Ibero-American countries support it as the 
United States would like? 
  [Sanin] We have not talked about the topic of Haiti and Cuba 
in this summit. We are going to see if the presidents, during 
the informal meetings, bring it up, but up to now the foreign 
ministers have not talked about it. [end recording] 
  These were the most relevant aspects of the meeting with the 
media at the Americano Hotel a few minutes ago where the foreign 
ministers have finished drafting the document that will be 
reviewed by the presidents. There is no doubt that they will 
discuss the topic of Haiti and Cuba, the two central topics that 
are not officially on the agenda but will be brought up by some 
of the countries that believe they are topics that Latin America 
cannot avoid at this time.

  [Text] Dajabon (Dominican Republic), 13 Jun (EFE) -- 
Hundreds of Haitians were unable to cross the border into the 
Dominican Republic today, while Dominican Defense Minister 
General Constantino Matos Villanueva was in the area. The 
minister traveled to the region to oversee the implementation of 
the UN embargo against Haiti. 
  Meanwhile, Genaro Paulino Alvarez, the Dominican consul in 
Quanaminthe, Haiti, told EFE that the Haitians "are dying of 
hunger, because the very poor are the ones suffering the 
hardship of the embargo." He asked that they be allowed to sell 
their goods in the Dominican Republic. Quanaminthe is located 3 
km from Dajabon, within the Haitian border. 
  The consul said that despite the fact the Haitians were 
"very 
patiently waiting" for the Dominican military to allow them to 
cross the border to purchase food and medicine, the presence of 
the defense minister made this impossible. 
  Since the coup d'etat in September of 1991, the Dominican 
authorities have allowed the Haitians to cross every Monday and 
Friday to buy and sell in the Dominican border communities. 
This was suspended at the end of May, when the total embargo, 
imposed by the international community, went into effect. 
  The consul added that Dominican soldiers opened the border 
for two hours last Friday for the Haitians to sell their goods. 
Alvarez, who is also the Dominican Republic's commercial 
representative in the area, said many Haitians have asked him to 
allow them to go into these Dominican communities to prevent 
their children from "dying of hunger." He admitted that many 
Haitians do defy the "sealed border." They try to bypass the 
military in order to get to the Dominican stores mainly to buy 
food. 
  The Dominican diplomat explained that about 2,000 Haitians 
would come to Dajabon every Monday and Friday to sell clothing, 
liquor, household goods, and other items. They would then buy 
food. When the border was completely open, however, more than 
1,000 Dominican citizens would cross the Haitian border to shop 
in Quanaminthe every Saturday and Sunday. 
  Alvarez said that during the rest of the week, citizens from 
the two countries that share La Espanola Island maintain a 
constant flow of trade that allows the Haitian population to 
purchase food and medicine.

  [Text] The National Office for Attention to Refugees 
[Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de los Refugiados, ONPAR] has 
reported that, since the Haitian political crisis broke out two 
years ago, approximately 200 Haitians have requested political 
asylum in Panama, but only 27 have qualified to receive it. 
  ONPAR Director Jose Javier Mulino told LA PRENSA that, since 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide was ousted, some 200 Haitians have 
requested refuge in Panama and that, of these, only 27 have 
qualified and nine cases are currently under study. 
  "We studied all the requests and confirmed that only 27 are 
classified as victims of political persecution by the regime of 
dictator Raoul Cedras," Mulino explained. The ONPAR conducts 
these analyses jointly with officials of the Endara 
administration and the UNHCR office. Mulino explained that to 
obtain political asylum the person must prove he is truly being 
politically persecuted.

<F P=106> ["Special item" by Jose Maria Monzon] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jun (NA) -- The Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit that will be held next week in the 
historical Colombian city of Cartagena de las Indias threatens 
to be an improvised forum to debate the Haitian situation. What 
causes even more concern is the foreboding of another political 
altercation between Argentina and the rest of Latin America. 
  The participation of President Carlos Menem and Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro also presupposes the possibility of a "quarrel" 
parallel to the summit, or at least leaves the door open for a 
verbal skirmish like at the summit in Salvador, Bahia [Brazil]. 
  Seeking to gain the attention of the participating chiefs of 
state, Menem has sent a letter in which he proposes that they 
work on a project that contemplates respect for the cultural and 
ethical values of the region. It is doubtful this hazy proposal 
will divert attention from a topic that has top priority for the 
continent: The need to restore deposed Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, that country's first democratically 
elected president, to the presidency. 
  Latin American governments know sooner or later they could 
face a situation similar to the one in December 1989 when the 
United States unilaterally invaded Panama on the pretext of 
extraditing General Manuel Noriega. 
  The constant failure of the United States -- of Washington 
in 
the first place, but the failure also has a hemispheric tendency 
-- to resolve the situation that began in Haiti in 1991, could 
prompt the unleashing of this new crisis. The foreboding is 
based on the fact that Bill Clinton personally announced the 
possibility of a U.S. military invasion followed by a new 
multinational experiment in how to create a democracy. 
  Latin American government fear centers on the fact that 
unilateral U.S. action would weaken the Inter-American 
consultation system represented first by the OAS and second by 
the Rio Group. The wounds opened in the region by actions in 
Panama and Grenada in the 1980's have yet to heal. 
  From what is known at the present time of the U.S. strategy, 
it can be surmised that an eventual invasion of Haiti will be 
the exclusive responsibility of the United States, but a second 
stage will require the participation of the rest of the Americas. 
  It is here where Argentina differs from the other countries 
of the region because no other Latin American government seems 
to be convinced of the benefits of an armed expedition that 
seems to be more related to placating the internal criticism 
that Clinton has to suffer than to benefiting suffering Haitians. 
  Those responsible for Menem's foreign policy stressed that 
they have stated as a condition that at least one other Latin 
American country should give its guarantee and cooperate, but 
these concepts only seem to be of a formal nature because Buenos 
Aires -- this is already known -- is the only capital that has 
not objected to any decision by Washington during the past 3 
years. 
  If a consensual solution is not arrived at regarding the way 
democracy is to be restored in Haiti, it is quite probable that 
the United States and Latin America will find themselves on 
opposite sides of the street. If this happens, the position of 
the Argentine Government is already known -- beginning with its 
obsession for unrestricted alignment.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 9 Jun (NA) -- Speaking in Switzerland, 
Antonio Cassia, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) 
secretary general, noted today: "Social unrest may grow in our 
country if we do not provide solutions" to the unemployment 
problem. He said unemployment in the federal capital and in 
Buenos Aires Province "has increased to about 12 percent." 
  Cassia said: "Social unrest will grow daily if quick 
solutions are not found," adding: "Prevention is always better 
than cure." 
  The trade union leader said the unemployment rate growth "is 
worrisome," adding: "If we compare our unemployment rate with 
other parts of the world, maybe it has not grown that much, but 
it is very indicative for Argentina." 
  In remarks to a Buenos Aires radio station from Geneva, 
where 
he is participating in the International Labor Organization 
(ILO) Annual Assembly, Cassia stressed this morning that "there 
are unfair wages" in Argentina. 
  Cassia pointed out: "We have provinces whose budgets are 
poorly allocated and whose three branches of government are 
paying fair salaries. But the workers are not asking for better 
wages; they just want to get paid." 
  Cassia added: "Provinces like Chaco, Salta, and Catamarca 
have not paid their workers for four to six months." 
  The oil workers union leader said: "The world's unemployment 
problem causes poverty, neglect, and specially social outcasts." 
  He added: "This problem involves all liberal economies." He 
said that, since listening to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali's speech this morning, "this issue is being taken 
very seriously." 
  During his speech to the ILO General Assembly yesterday, 
Cassia said the CGT rejects any attempt "to regulate the free 
collective bargaining system in our country." 
  He indicated: "We are willing to agree and not to dissent, 
but this does not include undue acceptances or complicity with 
interests contrary to our interests." 
  Cassia added that economic changes in Argentina "must be 
implemented based on the existence of investment policies, with 
real participation of the workers in transformation processes, 
employment policies, and environmental protection." 
  The trade union leader stressed: "We accept changes that 
will 
improve the Argentine economy, taking into account the social 
and labor situation through everyone's effort and equally shared 
burdens. We reject changes that seek to reduce the trade union 
presence as an balancing factor or seek to cause arbitrary and 
unfair deterioration of work standards."

  [Text] Santiago, 10 Jun (EFE) -- Open regionalism, growth 
with social equity, and the strengthening of democracy are the 
main proposals Chilean President Eduardo Frei will present to 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and 
Governments to be held on 14 and 15 June in Cartagena de Indias 
(Colombia). 
  This announcement was made by Foreign Relations Under 
Secretary Jose Miguel Insulza, who said Frei will leave for 
Cartagena on 13 June with a small delegation aboard a commercial 
flight. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will leave for 
Cartagena on 11 June to attend the preparatory meetings at the 
foreign minister level to decide on the proposals to be debated 
by the chiefs of state and governments. 
  Figueroa also confirmed that President Frei will meet with 
Spanish King Juan Carlos. He will probably meet with Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro. These meetings will depend on Frei's agenda. 
  Insulza confirmed that the Chilean Government has approved 
the agenda of the summit which will center mainly on economic 
issues. He added that Frei will promote open regionalism, a 
policy which Chile has successfully developed at the trade level 
through bilateral and multilateral agreements. 
  He said the Chilean Government wants a regional debate on 
growth with equity because it considers overcoming poverty to be 
the most important challenge for the countries of the region. 
  Regarding democracy, Inzulza said Chile advocates a stronger 
and better democracy in Ibero-America, efficient governments, 
honest administrations, and modernization of the state. 
  Inzulza added that Frei's proposals to the summit are 
closely 
linked to the general guidelines of his administration. 
  Frei was inaugurated last March after winning the December 
1993 elections with 58 percent of the vote. He chose as his 
government priority the fight against poverty through growth 
with equity. 
  To do this he created a national commission to fight 
poverty, 
which affects 4 million Chileans; some 1.2 million live in 
extreme poverty.

the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee-General Command 
of the Zapatist National Liberation Army "from the mountains of 
southeastern Mexico" in June 1994] 
  [Text] Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] 
  Mexico 
  Second Lacondona Jungle Declaration 
  Today we say: We will not surrender! 
  "...it is not only they who carry swords, who shed blood, 
and 
who emit radiant rays of military glory who are chosen to choose 
the personnel of a government for a people who want to 
democratize themselves; it is also the right of citizens who 
have fought in the media, who are identified with the principles 
of the revolution, who have fought the despotism that is 
undermining our laws because it is not only by firing bullets in 
the battlefields that tyrannies are defeated; it is also by 
launching ideas of redemption, expressions of freedom, and 
terrible curses against the executioners of the people that 
dictatorships and empires are overthrown (...) and if the 
historic facts show us that the demolition of all tyrannies, 
that the overthrow of all bad governments is the joint work of 
the idea with the sword, it is an absurd thing, it is an 
aberration, it is an outrageous despotism to want to segregate 
the healthy elements who have the right to elect the government 
because the sovereignty of a people is made up of all healthy 
elements who have a full awareness of their rights, whether they 
are civilians or accidentally armed people, but who love freedom 
and justice and work for the good of the fatherland." -- 
Emiliano Zapata in the voice of Paulino Martinez, Zapatist 
delegate to the Sovereign Revolutionary Convention, 
Aguascalientes, Mexico, 27 October 1914. 
  To the people of Mexico: 
  To the peoples and governments of the world: 
  Brothers: 
  The EZLN, on a war footing against the bad government since 
1 
January 1994, addresses you to explain our thoughts: 
  I. Mexican brothers: 
  In December 1993, we said ENOUGH! On 1 January 1994, we 
called on the legislative and judicial branches to assume their 
constitutional responsibility to prevent the genocidal policy 
that the federal executive branch is imposing on our people, and 
we based our constitutional right by applying Article 39 of the 
political Constitution of the United States of Mexico: 
  "The national sovereignty essentially orignates with and 
resides in the people. All public power comes from the people 
and is instituted for the benefit of the people. The people 
have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify its 
government." 
  This call was answered with an extermination policy and 
lies. 
The branches of government disregarded our just demands and 
allowed the massacre to be carried out. But the nightmare only 
lasted 12 days, because another force, superior to any political 
or military power, prevailed over the parties involved in the 
conflict. Civilian society assumed the duty of preserving our 
fatherland; it expressed its disagreement with the massacre and 
forced a dialogue. We all understood that the days of the 
eternally ruling party, which uses for its own benefit the 
product of the work of all Mexicans, cannot continue any longer, 
that the presidentialism that supports it inhibits freedom and 
cannot be allowed, that the fraudulent culture is the method by 
which democracy is limited and suppressed, that justice only 
exists for corrupt and powerful people, that we must make those 
in power learn how to obey, and that there is no other way. 
  This is something all honest Mexicans and all good-willed 
civilian society has understood. The only ones who are opposed 
are those who have based their success on stealing public 
assets; those who protect drug traffickers and murderers, 
thereby corrupting the justice system; and those who resort to 
political assassinations and electoral fraud to impose their 
wills. 
  Only these political fossils are planning to return to 
Mexico's past and to erase from the national conscience the 
shout that the entire country has cried out since 1 January 
1994: ENOUGH! 
  We should not let this happen. Today, we are not calling 
upon the government's ineffective branches that failed to 
fulfill their constitutional duties by allowing the executive 
branch to control them. Although the current legislators and 
magistrates have been undignified, others will come who will 
understand that they must serve their people and not themselves. 
Our call goes beyond a six-year administration or an 
approaching presidential election. Our sovereignty rests upon 
CIVILIAN SOCIETY; people are the ones who at any time can alter 
or modify our form of government, and have already decided to do 
so. It is the people to whom we issue a call in this. 
  SECOND LACANDONA JUNGLE DECLARATION 
  We say to them: 
  First: We have faithfully complied with conducting military 
actions within the framework of international agreements on war. 
This has given us the tacit recognition of nationals and 
foreigners as a belligerent force. We will continue honoring 
those agreements. 
  Second: We have ordered our regular and irregular forces 
throughout the national territory and abroad to observe a 
UNILATERAL EXTENSION OF THE CEASE-FIRE. We will continue to 
respect the cease-fire TO PERMIT CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO ORGANIZE IN 
WHATEVER WAYS IT DEEMS BEST TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE TRANSITION TO 
DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. 
  Third: We condemn the threat to civilian society posed by 
the country's militarization with personnel and modern 
repressive equipment prior to the upcoming federal elections. 
There is no doubt that the government of Salinas de Gortari 
will try to succeed through the culture of fraud. WE WILL NOT 
LET THIS HAPPEN. 
  Fourth: We propose to all independent political parties that 
they now recognize the intimidation and denial of political 
rights our people have suffered for the past 65 years and that 
they demand a government of political transition toward 
democracy. 
  Fifth: We reject manipulation and the attempt to separate 
our just demands from those of the Mexican people. We are 
Mexicans and will not give up our demands or our weapons until 
we have achieved democracy, liberty, and justice for all. 
  Sixth: We reiterate our desire for a political solution in 
Mexico's transit toward democracy. We urge civilian society to 
resume the heroic role it had in stopping the military phase of 
the war and to organize to conduct peaceful efforts toward 
democracy, liberty, and justice. A democratic change is the 
only alternative to war. 
  Seventh: We invite honest members of our civilian society to 
participate in a national dialogue for democracy, liberty, and 
justice for all Mexicans. 
  This is why we say: 
  II. Brothers: 
  After the war started in January 1994, the united voice of 
the Mexican people stopped the confrontation and called for a 
dialogue among the conflicting parties. The federal government 
responded to the just demands of the EZLN with offers that 
failed to touch the basic point of the problem: a lack of 
justice, liberty, and democracy on Mexican soil. 
  The degree of compliance with the proposals made by the 
federal government to the EZLN's demands has been determined by 
the political system of the ruling party. This system has 
allowed another power, which is above constitutional power, to 
exist in Mexican territory. Its roots keep the party in power. 
This system of complicity has promoted the existence and 
belligerence of bossism, the omnipotent power of cattlemen and 
merchants, and the infiltration of drug trafficking... The 
simple offering of the so-called Compromise for a Dignified 
Peace in Chiapas provoked a great uproar and open defiance on 
the part of these people. The single-party political system is 
trying to maneuver in this reduced horizon imposed by its 
existence. It cannot refrain from attacking these groups 
without hurting itself and it cannot leave things as they are 
without seeing an increase in the belligerence of peasants and 
Indians. In sum, compliance with the commitments implies, 
necessarily, the death of the system of the party of the state. 
By suicide or execution, the death of the current Mexican 
political system is a necessary condition, although not 
sufficient by itself, in our country's journey to democracy. 
There will be no real solutions to Chiapas' problems unless 
Mexico's problems are settled. 
  The EZLN realizes that the problem of Mexican poverty is not 
caused by a lack of resources alone. Its main contribution is 
to understand and point out that any effort, in one aspect or 
another, will only postpone a solution unless these efforts are 
made within a new framework of national, regional, and local 
political relations: a framework of democracy, liberty, and 
justice. The problem of power will not depend on who is the 
leader, but on who will exercise it. If power is exercised by a 
majority, the political parties will be forced to confront that 
majority and not one another. 
  Viewing the problem of power within the framework of 
democracy, liberty, and justice will force the creation of a new 
political culture within the parties. A new class of 
politicians should be born, and undoubtedly, a new types of 
political parties will be born. 
  We are not proposing a new world but the start of a new 
Mexico. This revolution would not end with the creation of a new 
class, part of a class or group in power, but in free and 
democratic "space" for political struggle. This free and 
democratic "space" will be born from the stinking corpse of the 
system of the party of the state and the presidential system. A 
new political relationship will be born. A new policy whose base 
is not a confrontation between political organizations but a 
confrontation between their political proposals and the various 
social classes, because the head of political power, and not its 
exercise, will depend on the GENUINE support offered by these 
groups. In this new political relationship, the new proposals 
of system and course (Socialism, Capitalism, Social Democracy, 
Liberalism, Christian Democracy, and so on) must convince a 
majority of the nation that their proposal is the best for the 
country, not that they will be "watched" by the country they 
lead to ensure they offer regular reports and are subjected to 
the nation's opinion on whether they should remain in power or 
be removed. A plebiscite is a regulated means to confront 
power, both the power of party and nation, and it deserves an 
important place in the ultimate law of the country. 
  The current Mexican legislation is too narrow for this new 
policy between rulers and those being ruled. There is a need 
for a NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION to produce a PROVISIONAL OR 
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT through the resignation of the federal 
chief executive or through elections. 
  The NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT should produce a new Constitution and new elections 
should be called within its framework. This process will always 
cause less pain to the country than that produced by a civil 
war. The prophecy of the south is valid for the entire country, 
and we can learn from past developments and make the delivery of 
the new Mexico less painful. 
  The EZLN has an idea of what system the country should have 
and what course it should follow. The political maturity of the 
EZLN, its coming of age as a representative of the feelings of 
part of the nation is based on the premise that it does not wish 
to impose this idea on the nation. The EZLN demands for itself 
what is evident: The coming of age of Mexico and the right to 
decide, freely and democratically, the course it should follow. 
This historic start will not only produce a fairer and improved 
Mexico, but also a new Mexico. We will risk our lives in this 
-- in giving to future Mexicans a country in which it is not 
shameful to live... 
  The EZLN, in an unprecedented democratic exercise within the 
armed organization, consulted its components on whether it 
should sign the peace agreement proposal presented by the 
federal government. In light of the fact that the main issues 
of democracy, liberty, and justice for all have not been 
resolved, the EZLN rank and file, which mostly comprises 
Indians, has decided to reject the signing of the government 
proposal. 
  Being under siege and pressured from various flanks which 
have threatened us with extermination if we failed to sign for 
peace, we, the Zapatists, reaffirm our determination to attain 
peace with justice and dignity, and in this endeavor we will 
offer our lives. We are again continuing the dignified struggle 
of our forefathers. The dignified call of insurgent Vicente 
Guerrero -- "Live for the Homeland or Die for Liberty" -- is 
coming out again from our throats. We cannot accept peace 
without dignity. 
  Our decision to fight resulted from the impossibility to 
fight peacefully for fundamental human rights, of which the most 
valuable is the right to choose, with freedom and democracy, a 
system of government. Currently, the possibility of a peaceful 
transition to democracy and freedom is facing a new struggle, 
namely, the electoral process of August 1994. There are those 
who are preparing for the postelectoral period by preaching 
apathy and disappointment from their stagnant positions. They 
seek to benefit from the blood shed by those who have fallen on 
all combat fronts, violent as well as peaceful, in the city and 
in the countryside. They are basing their political project on 
the postelectoral conflict, and hope, without doing anything, 
that political demobilization will again open the heavy gates of 
war. They will save, so they claim, the country. 
  Others, from now on, are anticipating that the armed 
conflict 
will begin before the elections and that the ensuing 
ungovernability will help them retain power. As they did 
yesterday, when they usurped the popular will through electoral 
fraud -- and, as they do today and will do tomorrow -- while in 
the confusion of preelectoral conflict, they are seeking to 
prolong the agony of a dictatorship which, disguised under the 
official party, has already lasted decades. Other sterile 
harbingers of apocalypse believe that a war is unavoidable, and 
they sit in wait for the corpse of their enemy... or of their 
friend, to be walked on. The sectarian mistakenly believes that 
the firing of rifles in and of itself will bring the dawn our 
people have awaited since that day when the night fell upon them 
following the deaths of Villa and Zapata on Mexican ground. 
  All of these thieves of hope believe that behind our 
weapons, 
there is ambition and a thirst for prestige, and that this will 
lead our path in the future. They are mistaken. There are 
other weapons behind our weapons -- the weapons of reason. Hope 
drives both types of weapons, and we will not let anyone take 
them away. 
  Hope by way of the trigger had its moment at the beginning 
of 
the year. It must now wait. It is necessary that the hope that 
exists in broad-based movements returns to playing the pivotal 
role it deserves out of right and reason. The flag is now in 
the hands of those who have names and faces; good, honest people 
who walk paths that are not ours, but whose goal is the same as 
we are fighting for. We respect these men and women and we 
respect and hope they will take that flag to its rightful place. 
We will be waiting, standing up with dignity. If that flag 
falls, we will pick it up again... 
  Let hope be organized and walk now in the valleys and 
cities, as it did yesterday in the mountains. Fight with the 
weapons available to you. Do not worry about us. We will know 
how to resist until the end. We will know how to wait... and we 
will know if the doors are closed again, so that dignity can 
prevail. 
  That is why we are addressing our brothers of nongovernment 
organizations, of peasant and Indian organizations; workers of 
the countryside and the city; teachers and students; housewives 
and settlers; artists and intellectuals; and members of 
independent parties of Mexico: 
  We appeal for a national dialogue on the topic of democracy, 
liberty, and justice. In turn, we are now calling for a 
National Democratic Convention (CDN). 
  We, the Zapatist National Liberation Army, are striving to 
achieve the democracy, liberty, and justice that our fatherland 
deserves, whereas: First, the supreme government has also 
usurped the legality bequeathed to us by the heroes of the 
Mexican revolution. Second, the existing Constitution no longer 
reflects the will of the Mexican people. Third, the ouster of 
the usurping federal government does not suffice, and it is 
necessary to have a new law for our new fatherland, which will 
be born of the struggles of all honest Mexicans. Fourth, all 
forms of struggle are necessary to achieve a transition to 
democracy in Mexico. 
  We appeal for the holding of a CDN [expansion unknown], 
sovereign and revolutionary, which will propose a transitional 
government and a new national law, a new constitution that will 
guarantee the legal fulfillment of the people's will. The 
fundamental objective of the CDN is to organize the civil 
expression and defense of the people's will. 
  The sovereign revolutionary convention will be national 
inasmuch as its composition must include all states of the 
federation. It will be pluralist because all patriotic forces 
will be represented. It will be democratic in the making of 
decisions because we will utilize national consultations. 
  The convention will be chaired freely and voluntarily by 
civilians and public personalities of renowned prestige, 
regardless of their political affiliation, race, religious 
creed, sex, or age. 
  The convention will comprise civilians through local, 
regional, and state committees in villages, neighborhoods, 
schools, and factories. These convention committees will be 
charged with gathering the people's proposals for the new 
constitution and their demands to be met by the new government, 
which will stem from the new constitution. The convention must 
demand the holding of free and democratic elections and struggle 
tirelessly for respect of the people's will. 
  The EZLN will recognize the CDN as the authentic 
representative of the interests of the Mexican people in their 
transition to democracy. 
  The EZLN exists throughout the territory of the nation and 
is 
now in a position to offer itself to the Mexican people, as 
guarantor of the fulfillment of the people's will. 
  For the first meeting of the CDN, the EZLN offers a Zapatist 
town as a venue and all the resources available to it. The date 
and place of the first session of the CDN will be announced in a 
timely manner. 
  III. Mexican brothers: 
  Our struggle continues. The Zapatist flags continue waving 
in the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Today we declare: We 
will not surrender! 
  In the mountains, we spoke with our dead so that they could 
point us to the road on which our gagged people must march. 
Drums resonated and the earth spoke of our pains and our 
history. Our dead say: "Everything to everybody." As long as 
this does not happen, there will be nothing for us. 
  Speak on behalf of other Mexicans, look into your hearts and 
speak to those for whom we struggle. Invite them to walk the 
honorable road of the faceless. Urge everybody to resist; let 
no one receive anything from those who give orders for the sake 
of giving orders. Turn the not-for-sale principle into the 
common banner of the majority. Ask those who speak encouraging 
phrases to give us more than words for our pain. Ask them to 
share our pain, to resist at your side, and to reject alms from 
the powerful. Let the good people from this land put together 
today the dignity that gives them the strength to resist and 
that prevents selling out. Let them put together this dignity to 
demand tomorrow that those who govern remain truthful to and 
hail the essence in the heart of the majority. Let the good 
road win in order that those who give the orders do so while 
obeying. 
  Do not surrender! Resist! Do not dishonor the truth! 
Resist with dignity in the land of true men and women. Let the 
mountains nestle the pain of the men of corn. Do not surrender! 
Resist! Do not sell out! Resist! 
  This is how the essence in the heart of all of those who 
have 
died. We have sensed that what our dead are saying is true and 
that their advice is truthful and honorable. This is why we are 
appealing to all of our Mexican Indian brothers to resist with 
us. We appeal to all peasants, workers, employees, settlers, 
housewives, students, and teachers, those whose life means 
thinking and speaking, and those who have dignity and honor. We 
appeal to all of them to resist with us because the corrupt 
government does not want democracy in our land. We will not 
accept anything from the rotten heart of the bad government -- 
not a single coin, or medicine, or rock, or one single grain, or 
the crumb of alms they are offering in exchange for our 
honorable march. 
  We will accept nothing from the supreme government; even if 
our pain and suffering increase; even if death continues sitting 
at our table, in our land, and in our beds; even if we see that 
others sell out to the oppressor; even if we ache everywhere; 
and even if the rocks cry out in pain. We will accept nothing. 
We will resist. We will accept nothing from the government. 
We will resist until those who give the orders do so by obeying. 
  Brothers, do not sell yourselves out. Resist with us. Do 
not surrender. Resist with us. Repeat with us these words, 
brothers: "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" Let this 
be heard not only in the mountains of the Mexican southeast but 
also in the north and in the peninsulas, on both coasts, and in 
the middle of the country. Let this be shouted in the valleys 
and the mountains. Let this resound in the cities and in the 
countryside. Unite, brothers; thunder with us; let our demands 
be your demands! "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" 
  Let dignity break the siege with which the dirty hands of 
the 
corrupt government is suffocating us. We are all besieged. 
They do not let democracy, liberty, or justice enter Mexican 
territory. Brothers, we are all besieged. Let us not surrender! 
Let us resist! Let us be honorable! Let us not sell out! 
  What good will wealth do for the powerful, if they cannot 
buy 
what is most valuable in this land, if the dignity of the 
Mexicans cannot be bought? What good will power do for the 
powerful? 
  Dignity does not surrender! Dignity resists! Democracy! 
Liberty! Justice!

  Second Lacondona Jungle Declaration 
  Today we say: We will not surrender! 
  "...it is not only they who carry swords, who shed blood, 
and 
who emit radiant rays of military glory who are chosen to choose 
the personnel of a government for a people who want to 
democratize themselves; it is also the right of citizens who 
have fought in the media, who are identified with the principles 
of the revolution, who have fought the despotism that is 
undermining our laws because it is not only by firing bullets in 
the battlefields that tyrannies are defeated; it is also by 
launching ideas of redemption, expressions of freedom, and 
terrible curses against the executioners of the people that 
dictatorships and empires are overthrown (...) and if the 
historic facts show us that the demolition of all tyrannies, 
that the overthrow of all bad governments is the joint work of 
the idea with the sword, it is an absurd thing, it is an 
aberration, it is an outrageous despotism to want to segregate 
the healthy elements who have the right to elect the government 
because the sovereignty of a people is made up of all healthy 
elements who have a full awareness of their rights, whether they 
are civilians or accidentally armed people, but who love freedom 
and justice and work for the good of the fatherland." -- 
Emiliano Zapata in the voice of Paulino Martinez, Zapatist 
delegate to the Sovereign Revolutionary Convention, 
Aguascalientes, Mexico, 27 October 1914. 
  To the people of Mexico: 
  To the peoples and governments of the world: 
  Brothers: 
  The EZLN, on a war footing against the bad government since 
1 
January 1994, addresses you to explain our thoughts: 
  I. Mexican brothers: 
  In December 1993, we said ENOUGH! On 1 January 1994, we 
called on the legislative and judicial branches to assume their 
constitutional responsibility to prevent the genocidal policy 
that the federal executive branch is imposing on our people, and 
we based our constitutional right by applying Article 39 of the 
political Constitution of the United States of Mexico: 
  "The national sovereignty essentially orignates with and 
resides in the people. All public power comes from the people 
and is instituted for the benefit of the people. The people 
have, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or modify its 
government." 
  This call was answered with an extermination policy and 
lies. 
The branches of government disregarded our just demands and 
allowed the massacre to be carried out. But the nightmare only 
lasted 12 days, because another force, superior to any political 
or military power, prevailed over the parties involved in the 
conflict. Civilian society assumed the duty of preserving our 
fatherland; it expressed its disagreement with the massacre and 
forced a dialogue. We all understood that the days of the 
eternally ruling party, which uses for its own benefit the 
product of the work of all Mexicans, cannot continue any longer, 
that the presidentialism that supports it inhibits freedom and 
cannot be allowed, that the fraudulent culture is the method by 
which democracy is limited and suppressed, that justice only 
exists for corrupt and powerful people, that we must make those 
in power learn how to obey, and that there is no other way. 
  This is something all honest Mexicans and all good-willed 
civilian society has understood. The only ones who are opposed 
are those who have based their success on stealing public 
assets; those who protect drug traffickers and murderers, 
thereby corrupting the justice system; and those who resort to 
political assassinations and electoral fraud to impose their 
wills. 
  Only these political fossils are planning to return to 
Mexico's past and to erase from the national conscience the 
shout that the entire country has cried out since 1 January 
1994: ENOUGH! 
  We should not let this happen. Today, we are not calling 
upon the government's ineffective branches that failed to 
fulfill their constitutional duties by allowing the executive 
branch to control them. Although the current legislators and 
magistrates have been undignified, others will come who will 
understand that they must serve their people and not themselves. 
Our call goes beyond a six-year administration or an 
approaching presidential election. Our sovereignty rests upon 
CIVILIAN SOCIETY; people are the ones who at any time can alter 
or modify our form of government, and have already decided to do 
so. It is the people to whom we issue a call in this. 
  SECOND LACANDONA JUNGLE DECLARATION 
  We say to them: 
  First: We have faithfully complied with conducting military 
actions within the framework of international agreements on war. 
This has given us the tacit recognition of nationals and 
foreigners as a belligerent force. We will continue honoring 
those agreements. 
  Second: We have ordered our regular and irregular forces 
throughout the national territory and abroad to observe a 
UNILATERAL EXTENSION OF THE CEASE-FIRE. We will continue to 
respect the cease-fire TO PERMIT CIVILIAN SOCIETY TO ORGANIZE IN 
WHATEVER WAYS IT DEEMS BEST TO MAKE POSSIBLE THE TRANSITION TO 
DEMOCRACY IN OUR COUNTRY. 
  Third: We condemn the threat to civilian society posed by 
the country's militarization with personnel and modern 
repressive equipment prior to the upcoming federal elections. 
There is no doubt that the government of Salinas de Gortari 
will try to succeed through the culture of fraud. WE WILL NOT 
LET THIS HAPPEN. 
  Fourth: We propose to all independent political parties that 
they now recognize the intimidation and denial of political 
rights our people have suffered for the past 65 years and that 
they demand a government of political transition toward 
democracy. 
  Fifth: We reject manipulation and the attempt to separate 
our just demands from those of the Mexican people. We are 
Mexicans and will not give up our demands or our weapons until 
we have achieved democracy, liberty, and justice for all. 
  Sixth: We reiterate our desire for a political solution in 
Mexico's transit toward democracy. We urge civilian society to 
resume the heroic role it had in stopping the military phase of 
the war and to organize to conduct peaceful efforts toward 
democracy, liberty, and justice. A democratic change is the 
only alternative to war. 
  Seventh: We invite honest members of our civilian society to 
participate in a national dialogue for democracy, liberty, and 
justice for all Mexicans. 
  This is why we say: 
  II. Brothers: 
  After the war started in January 1994, the united voice of 
the Mexican people stopped the confrontation and called for a 
dialogue among the conflicting parties. The federal government 
responded to the just demands of the EZLN with offers that 
failed to touch the basic point of the problem: a lack of 
justice, liberty, and democracy on Mexican soil. 
  The degree of compliance with the proposals made by the 
federal government to the EZLN's demands has been determined by 
the political system of the ruling party. This system has 
allowed another power, which is above constitutional power, to 
exist in Mexican territory. Its roots keep the party in power. 
This system of complicity has promoted the existence and 
belligerence of bossism, the omnipotent power of cattlemen and 
merchants, and the infiltration of drug trafficking... The 
simple offering of the so-called Compromise for a Dignified 
Peace in Chiapas provoked a great uproar and open defiance on 
the part of these people. The single-party political system is 
trying to maneuver in this reduced horizon imposed by its 
existence. It cannot refrain from attacking these groups 
without hurting itself and it cannot leave things as they are 
without seeing an increase in the belligerence of peasants and 
Indians. In sum, compliance with the commitments implies, 
necessarily, the death of the system of the party of the state. 
By suicide or execution, the death of the current Mexican 
political system is a necessary condition, although not 
sufficient by itself, in our country's journey to democracy. 
There will be no real solutions to Chiapas' problems unless 
Mexico's problems are settled. 
  The EZLN realizes that the problem of Mexican poverty is not 
caused by a lack of resources alone. Its main contribution is 
to understand and point out that any effort, in one aspect or 
another, will only postpone a solution unless these efforts are 
made within a new framework of national, regional, and local 
political relations: a framework of democracy, liberty, and 
justice. The problem of power will not depend on who is the 
leader, but on who will exercise it. If power is exercised by a 
majority, the political parties will be forced to confront that 
majority and not one another. 
  Viewing the problem of power within the framework of 
democracy, liberty, and justice will force the creation of a new 
political culture within the parties. A new class of 
politicians should be born, and undoubtedly, a new types of 
political parties will be born. 
  We are not proposing a new world but the start of a new 
Mexico. This revolution would not end with the creation of a new 
class, part of a class or group in power, but in free and 
democratic "space" for political struggle. This free and 
democratic "space" will be born from the stinking corpse of the 
system of the party of the state and the presidential system. A 
new political relationship will be born. A new policy whose base 
is not a confrontation between political organizations but a 
confrontation between their political proposals and the various 
social classes, because the head of political power, and not its 
exercise, will depend on the GENUINE support offered by these 
groups. In this new political relationship, the new proposals 
of system and course (Socialism, Capitalism, Social Democracy, 
Liberalism, Christian Democracy, and so on) must convince a 
majority of the nation that their proposal is the best for the 
country, not that they will be "watched" by the country they 
lead to ensure they offer regular reports and are subjected to 
the nation's opinion on whether they should remain in power or 
be removed. A plebiscite is a regulated means to confront 
power, both the power of party and nation, and it deserves an 
important place in the ultimate law of the country. 
  The current Mexican legislation is too narrow for this new 
policy between rulers and those being ruled. There is a need 
for a NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION to produce a PROVISIONAL OR 
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT through the resignation of the federal 
chief executive or through elections. 
  The NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION AND TRANSITIONAL 
GOVERNMENT should produce a new Constitution and new elections 
should be called within its framework. This process will always 
cause less pain to the country than that produced by a civil 
war. The prophecy of the south is valid for the entire country, 
and we can learn from past developments and make the delivery of 
the new Mexico less painful. 
  The EZLN has an idea of what system the country should have 
and what course it should follow. The political maturity of the 
EZLN, its coming of age as a representative of the feelings of 
part of the nation is based on the premise that it does not wish 
to impose this idea on the nation. The EZLN demands for itself 
what is evident: The coming of age of Mexico and the right to 
decide, freely and democratically, the course it should follow. 
This historic start will not only produce a fairer and improved 
Mexico, but also a new Mexico. We will risk our lives in this 
-- in giving to future Mexicans a country in which it is not 
shameful to live... 
  The EZLN, in an unprecedented democratic exercise within the 
armed organization, consulted its components on whether it 
should sign the peace agreement proposal presented by the 
federal government. In light of the fact that the main issues 
of democracy, liberty, and justice for all have not been 
resolved, the EZLN rank and file, which mostly comprises 
Indians, has decided to reject the signing of the government 
proposal. 
  Being under siege and pressured from various flanks which 
have threatened us with extermination if we failed to sign for 
peace, we, the Zapatists, reaffirm our determination to attain 
peace with justice and dignity, and in this endeavor we will 
offer our lives. We are again continuing the dignified struggle 
of our forefathers. The dignified call of insurgent Vicente 
Guerrero -- "Live for the Homeland or Die for Liberty" -- is 
coming out again from our throats. We cannot accept peace 
without dignity. 
  Our decision to fight resulted from the impossibility to 
fight peacefully for fundamental human rights, of which the most 
valuable is the right to choose, with freedom and democracy, a 
system of government. Currently, the possibility of a peaceful 
transition to democracy and freedom is facing a new struggle, 
namely, the electoral process of August 1994. There are those 
who are preparing for the postelectoral period by preaching 
apathy and disappointment from their stagnant positions. They 
seek to benefit from the blood shed by those who have fallen on 
all combat fronts, violent as well as peaceful, in the city and 
in the countryside. They are basing their political project on 
the postelectoral conflict, and hope, without doing anything, 
that political demobilization will again open the heavy gates of 
war. They will save, so they claim, the country. 
  Others, from now on, are anticipating that the armed 
conflict 
will begin before the elections and that the ensuing 
ungovernability will help them retain power. As they did 
yesterday, when they usurped the popular will through electoral 
fraud -- and, as they do today and will do tomorrow -- while in 
the confusion of preelectoral conflict, they are seeking to 
prolong the agony of a dictatorship which, disguised under the 
official party, has already lasted decades. Other sterile 
harbingers of apocalypse believe that a war is unavoidable, and 
they sit in wait for the corpse of their enemy... or of their 
friend, to be walked on. The sectarian mistakenly believes that 
the firing of rifles in and of itself will bring the dawn our 
people have awaited since that day when the night fell upon them 
following the deaths of Villa and Zapata on Mexican ground. 
  All of these thieves of hope believe that behind our 
weapons, 
there is ambition and a thirst for prestige, and that this will 
lead our path in the future. They are mistaken. There are 
other weapons behind our weapons -- the weapons of reason. Hope 
drives both types of weapons, and we will not let anyone take 
them away. 
  Hope by way of the trigger had its moment at the beginning 
of 
the year. It must now wait. It is necessary that the hope that 
exists in broad-based movements returns to playing the pivotal 
role it deserves out of right and reason. The flag is now in 
the hands of those who have names and faces; good, honest people 
who walk paths that are not ours, but whose goal is the same as 
we are fighting for. We respect these men and women and we 
respect and hope they will take that flag to its rightful place. 
We will be waiting, standing up with dignity. If that flag 
falls, we will pick it up again... 
  Let hope be organized and walk now in the valleys and 
cities, as it did yesterday in the mountains. Fight with the 
weapons available to you. Do not worry about us. We will know 
how to resist until the end. We will know how to wait... and we 
will know if the doors are closed again, so that dignity can 
prevail. 
  That is why we are addressing our brothers of nongovernment 
organizations, of peasant and Indian organizations; workers of 
the countryside and the city; teachers and students; housewives 
and settlers; artists and intellectuals; and members of 
independent parties of Mexico: 
  We appeal for a national dialogue on the topic of democracy, 
liberty, and justice. In turn, we are now calling for a 
National Democratic Convention (CDN). 
  We, the Zapatist National Liberation Army, are striving to 
achieve the democracy, liberty, and justice that our fatherland 
deserves, whereas: First, the supreme government has also 
usurped the legality bequeathed to us by the heroes of the 
Mexican revolution. Second, the existing Constitution no longer 
reflects the will of the Mexican people. Third, the ouster of 
the usurping federal government does not suffice, and it is 
necessary to have a new law for our new fatherland, which will 
be born of the struggles of all honest Mexicans. Fourth, all 
forms of struggle are necessary to achieve a transition to 
democracy in Mexico. 
  We appeal for the holding of a CDN [expansion unknown], 
sovereign and revolutionary, which will propose a transitional 
government and a new national law, a new constitution that will 
guarantee the legal fulfillment of the people's will. The 
fundamental objective of the CDN is to organize the civil 
expression and defense of the people's will. 
  The sovereign revolutionary convention will be national 
inasmuch as its composition must include all states of the 
federation. It will be pluralist because all patriotic forces 
will be represented. It will be democratic in the making of 
decisions because we will utilize national consultations. 
  The convention will be chaired freely and voluntarily by 
civilians and public personalities of renowned prestige, 
regardless of their political affiliation, race, religious 
creed, sex, or age. 
  The convention will comprise civilians through local, 
regional, and state committees in villages, neighborhoods, 
schools, and factories. These convention committees will be 
charged with gathering the people's proposals for the new 
constitution and their demands to be met by the new government, 
which will stem from the new constitution. The convention must 
demand the holding of free and democratic elections and struggle 
tirelessly for respect of the people's will. 
  The EZLN will recognize the CDN as the authentic 
representative of the interests of the Mexican people in their 
transition to democracy. 
  The EZLN exists throughout the territory of the nation and 
is 
now in a position to offer itself to the Mexican people, as 
guarantor of the fulfillment of the people's will. 
  For the first meeting of the CDN, the EZLN offers a Zapatist 
town as a venue and all the resources available to it. The date 
and place of the first session of the CDN will be announced in a 
timely manner. 
  III. Mexican brothers: 
  Our struggle continues. The Zapatist flags continue waving 
in the mountains of the Mexican southeast. Today we declare: We 
will not surrender! 
  In the mountains, we spoke with our dead so that they could 
point us to the road on which our gagged people must march. 
Drums resonated and the earth spoke of our pains and our 
history. Our dead say: "Everything to everybody." As long as 
this does not happen, there will be nothing for us. 
  Speak on behalf of other Mexicans, look into your hearts and 
speak to those for whom we struggle. Invite them to walk the 
honorable road of the faceless. Urge everybody to resist; let 
no one receive anything from those who give orders for the sake 
of giving orders. Turn the not-for-sale principle into the 
common banner of the majority. Ask those who speak encouraging 
phrases to give us more than words for our pain. Ask them to 
share our pain, to resist at your side, and to reject alms from 
the powerful. Let the good people from this land put together 
today the dignity that gives them the strength to resist and 
that prevents selling out. Let them put together this dignity to 
demand tomorrow that those who govern remain truthful to and 
hail the essence in the heart of the majority. Let the good 
road win in order that those who give the orders do so while 
obeying. 
  Do not surrender! Resist! Do not dishonor the truth! 
Resist with dignity in the land of true men and women. Let the 
mountains nestle the pain of the men of corn. Do not surrender! 
Resist! Do not sell out! Resist! 
  This is how the essence in the heart of all of those who 
have 
died. We have sensed that what our dead are saying is true and 
that their advice is truthful and honorable. This is why we are 
appealing to all of our Mexican Indian brothers to resist with 
us. We appeal to all peasants, workers, employees, settlers, 
housewives, students, and teachers, those whose life means 
thinking and speaking, and those who have dignity and honor. We 
appeal to all of them to resist with us because the corrupt 
government does not want democracy in our land. We will not 
accept anything from the rotten heart of the bad government -- 
not a single coin, or medicine, or rock, or one single grain, or 
the crumb of alms they are offering in exchange for our 
honorable march. 
  We will accept nothing from the supreme government; even if 
our pain and suffering increase; even if death continues sitting 
at our table, in our land, and in our beds; even if we see that 
others sell out to the oppressor; even if we ache everywhere; 
and even if the rocks cry out in pain. We will accept nothing. 
We will resist. We will accept nothing from the government. 
We will resist until those who give the orders do so by obeying. 
  Brothers, do not sell yourselves out. Resist with us. Do 
not surrender. Resist with us. Repeat with us these words, 
brothers: "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" Let this 
be heard not only in the mountains of the Mexican southeast but 
also in the north and in the peninsulas, on both coasts, and in 
the middle of the country. Let this be shouted in the valleys 
and the mountains. Let this resound in the cities and in the 
countryside. Unite, brothers; thunder with us; let our demands 
be your demands! "We will not surrender! We are resisting!" 
  Let dignity break the siege with which the dirty hands of 
the 
corrupt government is suffocating us. We are all besieged. 
They do not let democracy, liberty, or justice enter Mexican 
territory. Brothers, we are all besieged. Let us not surrender! 
Let us resist! Let us be honorable! Let us not sell out! 
  What good will wealth do for the powerful, if they cannot 
buy 
what is most valuable in this land, if the dignity of the 
Mexicans cannot be bought? What good will power do for the 
powerful? 
  Dignity does not surrender! Dignity resists! Democracy! 
Liberty! Justice!

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Antonio Roman and Candelaria Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas State, 8 Jun -- The State 
Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations (CEOIC) has stated 
that in agricultural matters, the various levels of government 
have not kept to the agreements, their proposals are incomplete 
and they seek to deprive jurisdiction, and the truth is that 
"they do not intend to definitely resolve the Chiapas land 
problem." 
  CEOIC, which represents 280 organizations, today warned in a 
communique that "events continue moving toward a confrontation." 
The organizations demand a "break of the military blockade" 
surrounding the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), 
respect for human rights in Chiapas, and a clear development and 
financing policy for Chiapas land. 
  Upon releasing the CEOIC communique, Arturo Luna Lujan, 
organization secretary for the Independent Agricultural and 
Peasant Workers Central Organization [Central independiente de 
Obreros Agricolas y Campesinos -- CIOAC] said that due to 
noncompliance by the federal and state governments, the peasant 
associations will start a permanent sit-down strike opposite the 
Tuxtla Gutierrez government palace. 
  One must remember that on 14 April, during one of the most 
critical moments of the land takeover, the CEOIC and several 
federal and state government entities, signed a truce agreement 
regarding the agrarian situation in Chiapas. In this truce 
agreement, peasant organizations that comprise CEOIC pledged to 
suspend the occupation of properties and land, while government 
authorities pledged to resolve the state's agrarian problem. 
  Among the main agrarian problems afflicting Chiapas are an 
enormous land tenancy, much agrarian backwardness, multiple 
presidential resolutions that have not been carried out, and 
hundreds of unfulfilled land requests. 
  Currently, despite the fact the exact area is not known, it 
is reported that about 50,000 hectares have been taken by Indian 
and peasant organizations in several places in the state, and a 
further 40,000 hectares within the conflict area, mainly in 
Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Las Margaritas Municipalities -- the 
latter being where the EZLN is located. 
  At the same time the CEOIC and government were signing the 
agreement on 14 April, negotiations were also begun with other 
government entities at the federal level, such as with the 
Social Development and Government Secretariats, with which a 
series of measures and meetings were agreed upon to deal with 
the various demands presented by the groups that comprise CEOIC. 
  "Despite these agreements, the replies have been 
noncompliance, proposals have been incomplete and seek to 
deprive jurisdiction, and a there is a lack of desire to resolve 
once and for all the Chiapas land problem," the brief CEOIC text 
states. It regrets that despite all its efforts to reach true 
peace, with justice, democracy, and social development, events 
advance toward confrontation. 
  That is why to solve their demands, the CEOIC demands the 
presence and commitment of Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno; 
Secretaries Victor Cervera Pacheco, Carlos Rojas, and Carlos 
Hank Gonzalez, for Agrarian Reform, Social Development, and 
Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, respectively; Jorge Madrazo 
Cuellar, president of the National Human Rights Commission; 
Humberto Benitez Trevino, Attorney General of the Republic; and 
Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation 
in Chiapas State. 
  Peasant leader Arturo Luna Lujan said that CEOIC members 
watch the weeks go by without receiving a definite reply from 
the authorities because until now all they have received have 
been written proposals. This situation has generated a climate 
of uncertainty and desperation, therefore the council peasants 
have decided to resort to a permanent sit-down strike as a way 
to exert pressure on the federal and local governments to give a 
positive reply to these demands. 
  When referring to the number of strikers, Luna Lujan said 
there will be between 2,000-5,000 peasants and Indians, but the 
numbers could increase gradually as the days pass without true 
solutions. 
  We are asked not to takeover land, not to hinder the peace 
and reconciliation process, but the authorities "do not make the 
slightest effort to keep their word or to contribute to the 
creation of a climate of stability that leads to a favorable 
situation for signing the peace agreements," he concluded.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria at the opening </F>
ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartegena de 
Indias -- live] 
  [Text] Ibero-American chiefs of state and heads of 
governments, foreign relations ministers, representatives of 
international organizations, delegation members, authorities, 
and ladies and gentlemen: I want to open this speech by thanking 
so many friendly nations for the solidarity demonstrated in 
light of the painful moments we Colombians are experiencing as a 
result of last week's natural disaster that adversely affected 
thousands of my compatriots -- the Paez Indians in the Cauca and 
Huila departments. In memory of those who perished, I ask you 
for one minute of silence. [minute of silence observed] 
  Cartagena de Indias awoke today in a festive mood. There is 
excitement in the Bay of Souls [bahia de las animas] and rumors 
of fandango in Chambacu. The word is being spread from balcony 
to balcony. 
  The local residents, as is true of all Colombians, are happy 
to have you here, chiefs of state and heads of governments. We 
hope that your stay among us is pleasant, advantageous, and that 
the protection of our Lady of the Candelaria of Popa will 
descend warmly on all of you. Lets us attempt to hear the 
faithful, who under the mudejar [multicolored decorations of 
Islamic influence] of San Toribio Church, mouth their prayers 
with a faint Andalusian accent, while outside the first notes of 
a ballenato [Colombian folk music] drowned the cry of a black 
female street vendor. These are the sounds of this marvelous 
cultural unity that is manifested in a new voice -- that of 
Ibero-America. 
  Cartagena de Indias, the same as Guadalajara, Madrid, or 
Salvador de Bahia, reflects the rich blend of cultures and races 
that today brings us together for the fourth time. Here we must 
stop, look at where we came from, and see where we are headed, 
and we must share our experiences to continue constructing a 
better future for our people. 
  We are living in times of change. The mere disappearance of 
global bipolarism has not given us the feeling that peace, 
progress, and justice is nearer or is now more feasible. With 
the conclusion of the confrontation between the two blocs that 
antagonized one another for so long, we unfortunately are 
witnesses to old and unfriendly nationalisms. These are 
fanaticisms that threaten peace and stability as much as the 
presence of extreme poverty and social injustice in many nations 
of the world. While we are assembled here, thousands of human 
beings continue dying, victims of racism, xenophobia, fraticidal 
wars, resentments shaped over the centuries, territorial 
disputes, or the simple and terrorizing incapacity of mankind to 
offer what is promised to all -- namely, liberty, justice, and 
equality. 
  Nevertheless, I also believe we are living in times in which 
there is a place for the [word indistinct] hope. In recent 
years, we have initiated the making of a new world order, marked 
by signs of interdependence. In recent years, my dear friends, 
we have been able to make possible the hope of replacing a phase 
marked by domination [word indistinct] by cooperation. 
  I dream about the Americas being integrated from North to 
South, a place where a free trade zone from Alaska to Patagonia 
will be more than a great expression. Likewise, I dream about 
the Americas, as Europe, being united not only economically, but 
also scientifically, technologically, and political, and 
enjoying a rich and diverse culture. I also dream about the 
Asia-Pacific region being consolidated and expanding. I dream 
about a Middle East that is conscious of the need for peaceful 
coexistence and conscious of the benefits of converting to a 
common market. And, of course, I dream about Africa remarking 
its boundaries, overcoming old disputes among brothers, and 
progressing with the solidarity cooperation of the international 
community. 
  We are gathered here today to create this future dream much 
closer to all of us so that to travel through Ibero-America no 
other document is needed than the language we inherited from our 
parents, Spanish and Portuguese. We need to make it possible 
for anyone to work in a profession or a trade in any part of 
Ibero-America; it would suffice to show a diploma issued in any 
one of our nations; to encourage investments to flow from one 
side of the Atlantic to the other... [Gaviria clears his throat] 
excuse me, from one side of the Atlantic to the other, taking 
advantage of the open markets and distributing the benefits that 
emerge from the innovation of technological development and 
strategic alliances; to make Ibero-America an economic and 
cultural bloc open to the rest of the world; to have 
Ibero-America interact and enrich its relations with other 
communities; and, in order to lead, to assume the challenges and 
take advantage of the opportunities that the third millennium 
offers. 
  Let no prejudice or obstacle hinder our authentic 
brotherhood. 
  This dream may have many interpretations, but it is 
essentially one dream -- an Ibero-America that does not need 
bridges across borders, because there are no borders in the 
souls and the minds of the people. 
  We are here because there is a vision we can dream about 
here 
today, in Cartagena de Indias, the site where another dream took 
root 500 years ago -- the meeting of cultures. If we look 
beyond the abyss of time and peer into the future, all of this 
appears as something that is finally possible. It depends on us 
to turn a horizon full of options into a future of wellbeing for 
our people. 
  Dear friends: During the days that have preceded this 
summit, I have been constantly asked about its importance. I 
have given a simple answer: I believe that in any relationship 
there is nothing like a handshake and a frank dialogue. 
  Three Ibero-American summits have taken place. Much progress 
has been made in reaching political agreements, and many useful 
exchanges of experience have taken place. The ambitious index 
of the Ibero-American summits now includes science and 
technology, education and training, sustainable development, 
human rights, support for the Indian population, social 
policies, and, on this occasion, economic matters such as 
investment, development, commerce, integration, and the 
consolidation of reforms that many of our countries have 
promoted in recent years. 
  Regarding issues that form part of this meeting's agenda, it 
is necessary to acknowledge that the economic situation of the 
majority of the Ibero-American countries during the past 10 
years has not been free of trauma. The debt crisis, with all of 
its repercussions, made evident the vulnerability of our 
economies and the worn-out condition of the economic development 
system then in vogue. 
  We believed that by substituting imports we would strengthen 
our autonomy, but we crashed against insufficient domestic 
markets and found an omnipresent state, lack of competition, and 
excessive protectionism. 
  This is why in many of our countries we had to make, in 
varying degrees, significant structural changes to our economies. 
  Increased fiscal discipline; inflation controls; free 
markets; the rationalization of the state's size; the creation 
of opportunities in the private sector; the adoption of 
competitive frameworks for attracting new foreign investments; 
the introduction of labor, currency exchange, financial, and tax 
reforms; and other things have encouraged trends toward 
renovation. 
  I think we have seen a profound change of attitude that 
allows us to increasingly incorporate ourselves with the rest of 
the world and at the same time leave behind the miserableness 
whose only promise was the perpetuation of our backwardness. 
  At the same time, we are practicing commercial policies that 
now are no longer designed to separate us, as they were before, 
but are designed to unite us. 
  For many of us, free trade and integration, of course, are 
probably the best antidote against the poverty that still exists 
in our nations. 
  How are we going to consolidate the reforms through which 
many of our countries overcame the lost decade? What should 
accompany the economic adjustments and the opportunities that 
free trade and integration open in order to secure the social 
benefits that we are searching for and that our people have 
wanted for so long? What can we do to make the reforms last 
and, especially, generate egalitarianism? 
  We must acknowledge the fact that adjustment policies alone 
have not produced growth in all countries and that these 
adjustment policies have not guaranteed a better distribution of 
income. Economic reforms could in some cases have weakened the 
state, and in some countries, it is an obsolete solution for 
today's problems. 
  Finally, everyday it becomes more evident that the 
commercial 
liberalization effort we have made must aim at harmonizing the 
agreements that have been reached. 
  These are some of the challenges we have ahead of us. This 
is why this fourth summit's agenda responds to the urgent need 
for jointly exchanging opinions on how to face these challenges. 
Fortunately, the current international framework is more 
suitable for meeting these challenges. 
  Never before in the history of mankind have so many human 
beings enjoyed democracy and liberty. Never before has there 
been such an ambitious multilateral trade system as that which 
emerged a few weeks ago following the culmination of the GATT 
Uruguay Round. The principal economies of the industrialized 
world are gradually recovering. There is a growing wave and a 
massive awakening of consciences in the quest for sustainable 
development. We have based our hopes on our own economic 
performance during the next few years. Here I refer not only to 
the fact that our countries will be perceived as attractive new 
markets but to the structural conditions of many of our 
economies, which have transformed us, without considering what 
Spain and Portugal would add, into what will be the region with 
the most dynamic growth in the coming years, second only to the 
Asian Pacific region. 
  Messrs. chiefs of state and government; following those 
statements, perhaps I should very briefly mention something that 
is an internal part of each country and which I truly believe 
will be a vital topic on the Ibero-American summit agenda in the 
next couple of years. I speak of the strengthening of 
democracy. Without flexible instruments for popular 
participation in principal group decisionmaking, without strong 
judicial organizations approved by the citizens, without 
security for citizens and their properties, without efficient 
mechanisms to promote and protect human rights, without pure 
electoral systems, without both governors and governed being 
held responsible for their actions and omissions, without 
efficient public organizations, and, above all, without an exact 
redefinition of the roles of the public and private sector in 
search of public equality, without all this, there cannot be 
true democracies among us. 
  Last, what brings us together here is the necessity to 
consolidate economic reforms in such a way that they will 
guarantee a better distribution of income, stimulate savings, 
and increase investment, thus spurring economic growth. What 
has brought us this far is our desire to make inroads into 
political reforms that will strengthen the state, enable greater 
democratic participation, and defend human rights. What has 
brought us here is an imperative need to make trade serve as a 
bridge for the welfare of our peoples. Of course we hope that 
free trade and expanded markets will also benefit the smaller 
countries. 
  Your Majesties, Esteemed Presidents, Messrs. Chiefs of 
Government, friends, everyone; we are Ibero-American. We 
represent the voice of Ibero-America and here we are. It is my 
heartfelt wish that the tradition initiated in Mexico and 
enriched in Spain and Brazil will continue during these two 
days, providing us a new opportunity to dream as a group. 
Within these streets of Cartagena, a place where everything is 
possible, as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, our Nobel prize winner, 
always says, in these walls which served one day to defend the 
city from pirates and corsairs, within the castle walls, where 
the dreams of our forefathers came true, we have the opportunity 
today to again take up the reins of our countries' destinies, to 
forge a more dignified, prosperous, and peaceful life for our 
peoples. I declare this Ibero-American summit of chiefs of 
states and governments inaugurated. Thank you. [applause]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera said today at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit that Cuba should return to the Latin 
American family of nations but it also must change its political 
system. 
  "I believe the time has come for Cuba to fully join the 
community and the judicial and social systems of the continent," 
Caldera said in his speech during the summit's opening session. 
  Immediately thereafter, the Venezuelan president said: "with 
my greatest respect, the time has also come for Cuba to change 
its own system, for which the world situation is favorably 
disposed."

  [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 14 Jun (AFP) -- At the 
Cartagena summit, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera spoke 
about the creation of a movement to decry and fight corruption 
and said that "we must punish those who rob the states' moneys 
to benefit themselves." He maintained corruption is one of the 
worst evils that is currently eating away at the world's 
countries. 
  He also noted we must implement a priority program to fight 
poverty in Latin America. He pointed out he advocates Cuba's 
admittance into the American accord and recognized this is the 
right time to revise the Ibero-American system. 
  President Caldera greeted the heads of state who are 
attending the Cartagena summit, especially those who are about 
to end their terms, and stressed that their successors "must 
support and strengthen the region's integrationist and 
democratic movement." 
  The Venezuelan president defended democracy and said that he 
bases himself not only on popularity ratings but also on 
macroeconomic figures that show progress is the community's 
foundation for peace and harmony. He added we are "deeply 
moved" as economic indicators reveal "a growth in poverty." 
  Caldera pleasingly admitted that international financial 
institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, have 
recognized that the fight against poverty requires the unity of 
the community and demanded industrialized nations increase 
social development contributions. He added that by holding 
talks we must understand that the foreign debt issue deserves a 
great deal of attention because it has become a very onerous 
burden for some countries. He insisted "we must find tangible 
solutions to these problems." 
  He said "economic reactivation alone is not enough to solve 
our nations' socioeconomic crises," and demanded joining efforts 
"to achieve being understood and recognizing that the fight 
against poverty must become a priority." 
  Afterwards, Caldera mentioned one of the thorniest issues of 
the summit: corruption. He pointed out "corruption is one of 
the most serious evils that are choking our countries" and urged 
his colleagues "to commit ourselves to sanction rather than 
protect those who steal official funds despicably and put our 
nations in deteriorating situations." 
  The Venezuelan head of state noted "just as we fight against 
drug trafficking, I invite you to commit ourselves to not 
support and to morally and materially defeat those who commit 
crimes of corruption," adding that "we are currently living hard 
times" in many countries. 
  President Caldera admitted that summits like the Cartagena 
summit "constitute a great hope" for the future. "At this 
summit, I want to express my faith and hope that we will be able 
to overcome the situation we are currently facing and to respond 
to the terrible dilemma we are living," President Caldera 
concluded.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Argentine President Carlos Menem today called for "a change" 
toward democracy in Cuba and he underlined that "no country" in 
Ibero-America "has achieved economic growth under a 
dictatorship." 
  Menem, addressing the heads of state and government who are 
attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia, also defended his state reform policy as a 
means of fostering development. 
  The Argentine president delivered his message after calling 
for a 10-minute recess that was granted by host President Cesar 
Gaviria, despite the delays that are piling up on the summit's 
agenda. 
  "The economic deterioration process will be irreversible if 
policies are not guided by a democratic government," Menem 
underscored in an apparent response to the previous message by 
Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
  After explaining that "it is not my intention to meddle in 
the affairs of other countries," Menem said that "politics, the 
art of the possible, and socially projected economics, should 
not be contemplated separately because they complement each 
other." 
  The "profound" state reform that was set in motion in 
Argentina "has not only strengthened the state's role but has 
been an efficient weapon in combating corruption," he said. 
  Menem said that each of the large Argentine Government 
institutions that were turned over to national and foreign 
private investment "were true monuments to corruption." 
  Carlos Menem pointed out that he will ask the Ibero-American 
heads of state and government to "join him in a campaign to 
defend life." 
  "For me, life begins at the moment of conception, but we 
will 
discuss that at our work meetings," concluded Menem, who wants 
the summit to speak out against abortion.

  [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban 
President Fidel Castro today wished for success for the Summit 
of the Americas to be held in the United States at the end of 
this year, but he cautioned against Washington's intentions for 
convoking it. 
  In his first speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the 
Cuban president regretted that his country is being excluded 
from that forum to take place in Miami, Florida, in December. 
He said that it will be a good opportunity for demanding the 
end of the economic blockade against Cuba. 
  During the speech, Castro, clearly alluding to the United 
States, asked: "What can we expect today from an invariably 
expansionist, egotistic, and hegemonist power?" 
  The Cuban chief of state, who wore a white guayabera instead 
of his usual military uniform said: Ibero-American summits have 
reaffirmed the decision of the countries of the region to meet 
"without asking others for permission and without irritating 
exclusions." 
  He noted that Washington's proposal is aimed at congregating 
the chiefs of state of the continent in the city of Miami, mecca 
of Cubans who have lived in exile for the past three decades. 
  Castro said: "The alleged landlords of this hemisphere have 
prohibited Cuba, a country that has endured aggressions and a 
blockade for more than 30 years, to participate in that meeting" 
in Miami. The Cuban chief of state complained: "How much 
cowardice, mediocrity, and political misery that exclusion 
reveals." 
  Castro added: "There has been an Alliance for Progress and 
the Initiative for the Americas. No one remembers them now." 
[passage omitted] 
  Castro spoke in favor of establishing hemispheric 
cooperation 
mechanisms to combat drug-trafficking, but he cautioned that 
this must not be done at the expense of the sovereignty of 
countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The 
main priority of Ibero-American countries is "the well-being of 
those who have less," Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari said today at the first working session of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. 
  "It is not possible to advance with inefficient, isolated 
economies, nor is it possible with internationalized economies 
that are socially irresponsible," Salinas de Gortari added. 
According to Salinas de Gortari, "we must insist that economic 
recovery go hand in hand with social reforms." 
  Salinas de Gortari said that he views with optimism 
bilateral 
and multilateral trade agreements signed during the past few 
years by countries of the American Continent because "free trade 
and the just exchange of goods and capital will benefit all of 
us." In addition, he called for a more active presence of 
Ibero-American countries in international organizations, and 
particularly mentioned the World Trade Organization, 
(?affiliated to GATT), which he hopes to chair. 
  Salinas de Gortari expressed his solidarity with Colombia 
over the natural disaster that affected the regions of Cauca and 
Huila last week, which caused more than 1,000 deaths. He also 
congratulated his Colombian counterpart and host, Cesar Gaviria, 
for his election this year as the new OAS secretary general. 
  Salinas de Gortari delivered his speech at the inauguration 
of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which was delayed six hours 
because most of the heads of state and government attending the 
event used double and even triple the amount of time they were 
expected to use (seven minutes each).

<F P=106> [Report by Oscar Navarro from Cartagena de Indias; from the </F>
"ACIR Radio News" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] During his speech to the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit of heads of state and government, President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari suggested the signing of more bilateral and 
multilateral agreements in the region as a new concept of 
integration among all the countries of the continent and 
Ibero-America. Speaking at the convention center in Cartagena 
de Indias, Colombia, the Mexican president explained the reasons 
our country had for diversifying its relations and for promoting 
domestic efforts for reforms, similar to what is happening in 
other nations. However, Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned that 
diversification of relations should not be an excuse to distract 
commercial flow. Let us hear what he said: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] Other Ibero-American nations have 
implemented plans in accordance to the needs of their people. 
This encourages shared purposes. Efforts for integration among 
our nations should not be an excuse to distract commercial flow 
nor to appear as blocs closed to exchange. Compatible with 
GATT, we can reach agreements that will be the motors of our 
economic activity, investment, creation of jobs, and 
distribution of income, which in the end is the important thing. 
[end recording] 
  The Mexican president also stressed that there must be 
greater recognition of the unilateral efforts for opening and 
change which must be expanded to areas such as services, labor, 
and the environment, all of which are factors for progress, 
greater coordination of monetary policies, exchange of 
technology, and shared production to strengthen commercial 
openings and investment. President Salinas de Gortari said that 
Ibero-America must use its influence in the multilateral forums, 
especially in the new trade organization. The president said 
that our priority today is the well-being of those who have less 
because it is not possible to advance with inefficient and 
isolated economies, nor can progress be made with 
internationalized economies that are socially irresponsible. 
For this reason, Salinas de Gortari said that we must insist on 
an economic recovery that goes hand in hand with well-thought 
and balanced social reforms, with democratic progress in 
pluralism. 
  Today's speeches by Salvadoran President Armando Calderon 
Sol, Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera, and Argentine 
President Carlos Menem, were also very important. They 
suggested an opening for the Cuban people's democracy. This 
could be important in strengthening peace and stability in the 
region. Fidel Castro did not broach this issue; however, he was 
very clear in stating that the U.S. blockade on Cuba must end. 
This is what he said: 
  [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, this is an excellent 
opportunity to demand that the U.S. Government abide by the UN 
resolution on the criminal and unjust blockade against Cuba. 
[end recording] 
  I also wish to add that today's Colombian newspapers, 
especially the Cartagena de Indias newspapers, did not give much 
coverage to the summit. Instead they reported that the 
Colombian soccer team traveled to the United States today to 
participate in the World Cup.

  [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina, during the first working session 
of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena today, called 
for a human-oriented economic integration process. He pointed 
out that the foreign debt continues to be a heavy burden for the 
Central American nations. 
  The leader seemed less optimistic about the region's 
economic 
recovery during the last few years than his other 20 
Ibero-American colleagues. Reina said that it was still 
impossible to speak of the expansion of economic recovery. 
  The Honduran president said "we must recognize that poverty 
has increased in the region." This is the first Ibero-American 
leaders' meeting he has attended, as the group has already 
gathered in the previous three consecutive years: in Guadalajara 
(Mexico), Madrid (Spain), and Salvador de Bahia (Brazil). 
  He added that "we must work toward an Ibero-American 
community with organizations that have the power to decide." He 
stressed that regional economic integration must not be the only 
priority, as the process must also include other important 
social issues. 
  Reina demanded "equal treatment" from the international 
financial institutions for Central America, whose leaders he 
encouraged to unite and to negotiate trade and commercial 
agreements with the rest of the continent as a bloc.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- In 
his speech to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit today, Salvadoran 
President Armando Calderon Sol called for the formation of a 
"common front to defend our legitimate right to development." 
  Calderon, who assumed the presidency of his country on 1 
June 
and is participating in this forum for the first time, advocated 
the strengthening of representative democracy and the promotion 
of human rights and economic and social development as the 
Ibero-American community's "major objectives." The Salvadoran 
president pointed out that they would be able to attain the 
Ibero-American peoples' aspirations of "living in peace, 
liberty, and with greater opportunities" once such conditions 
are attained. 
  He observed that almost all the countries in Ibero-America 
enjoy democracy and added that "well-defined and concrete 
measures and actions," which conform to the current 
international economic trends, must be taken to confront the 
challenges posed by commerce, integration, and development. In 
this sense, he stressed, ways must be found to include regional 
economies in the international sphere, especially after the GATT 
Uruguay Round which will allow the opening of new markets for 
developing countries. 
  As with the Central American presidents who spoke before 
him, 
the Salvadoran highlighted the "feasible development" 
[desarrollo sostenible] program implemented by the Isthmian 
countries. This program ties economic growth to respect for the 
environment and social problems for the people which, according 
to the Salvadoran president, requires "pragmatic policies." The 
struggle for development, he asserted, is not circumscribed to 
the liberalization of commerce but to the promotion of 
integration as a response to the international challenges. 
  The program has made noteworthy progress in Central America 
since the Central American Integration System was created in 
1991. This organization comprises a region where peace, 
liberty, and democracy have been consolidated. "However, we 
must admit the tasks we have set out to achieve are challenged 
by the difficulties inherent to our condition as a developing 
nation," he added. 
  Calderon concluded by calling on the countries to take 
advantage of the historic, ethnic, and cultural ties binding the 
participating nations and to redouble their efforts for the 
"possible creation of the Ibero-American Community of Nations."

  [Text] President Fidel Castro broke away from the agenda of 
the summit today and addressed the Ibero-American Summit after 
the session for each of the participants to speak had ended. 
Castro warned democracy must be understood within the context 
of a great discussion among Latin Americans, and he demanded 
solidarity for the people of Cuba who are suffering due to the 
U.S. blockade, which he described as criminal. Castro requested 
the floor from Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who 
was presiding over this afternoon's session. Castro said: 
  [Begin Castro recording] In conclusion, I will say I respect 
your ideas. I sincerely respect your ideas, concepts, and 
thoughts about democracy. We would have to hold a summit to 
discuss what democracy is, what participation of the people is, 
and why millions die in this hemisphere each year from disease 
and hunger when they could be saved. [end recording] 
  Following Castro's speech, Bolivian President Gonzalo 
Sanchez 
de Lozada responded, saying even though there is still much to 
study and understand about the Cuban experience, he trusts that 
democracy will come to the island and that Castro will be at the 
head of a second Cuban revolution. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] Possibly [words indistinct], but I 
know a change will occur, and we all wish you [words indistinct] 
respect that all this [words indistinct] big river, big ocean 
[word indistinct]. [end recording] 
  This was the second time Castro addressed the summit. His 
first speech was scheduled, the second was not. We asked 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo for his views 
regarding Castro's speech. Gaviria said: The speech Cuban 
President Fidel Castro made follows the pattern of words the 
Cuban Government uses at international meetings. They never 
sidetrack from this pattern. President Gaviria was also asked 
what he thought of the fact that Castro was wearing civilian 
clothes. Gaviria said: We were accustomed to seeing him in his 
olive green uniform, but we saw him wearing a guayabera today. 
It is an encouraging change, Gaviria said, adding there are 
also encouraging signs for Latin American democracy.

  [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia,) 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
At the inauguration of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit today, 
the leaders of 21 countries agreed that development must be 
humanized and integration and free trade promoted. [passage 
omitted] 
  In accordance to the general theme of the conference, 
dedicated to development and integration, the heads of state 
asserted the need to achieve economic growth without leaving the 
people's social needs to one side. 
  In one of the few speeches that conformed to the time limit 
assigned to each leader, Spanish King Juan Carlos also advocated 
the need to strengthen social development and respect for human 
rights. [passage omitted] 
  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez called on his 
colleagues to admit with "courage" that the adjustment policies 
had not solved the unequal distribution of wealth or the 
unemployment problem. However, like several of his colleagues, 
such as Argentine Carlos Menem or Panamanian Guillermo Endara, 
the Spanish socialist mentioned with optimism the democratic and 
economic achievements made by the Ibero-American countries since 
the Salvador de Bahia (Brazil) conference a year ago. 
  As had been done by Endara and Menem, Guatemalan President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Ecuadoran Sixto Duran-Ballen 
highlighted the advances made by their respective 
administrations in the economic and political spheres. In 
addition, De Leon Carpio promised, despite the difficulties that 
have arisen, he would do everything possible to continue the 
peace negotiations with the guerrillas as scheduled and reach an 
agreement before the end of the year. The Guatemalan guerrillas 
comprise the last such organization still active in Central 
America. 
  Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and Peruvian 
President Alberto Fujimori, the latter with much more vehemence 
and thoroughness, defended the countries' right to their 
institutional peculiarities. The Andean head of state, who was 
strongly criticized by his colleague two years ago when he took 
on extraordinary powers and suspended the parliament and the 
Supreme Court, said political systems cannot be called good or 
bad and must be graded based upon their results and without any 
foreign interference. 
  Chilean Eduardo Frei and Paraguayan Juan Carlos Wasmosy, 
who, 
as with five other presidents elected recent months, attended an 
Ibero-American summit for the first time, called for the 
promotion of free commerce and integration, which the Andean 
leader leaned toward "open regionalism." 
  The newest president was Salvadoran Armando Calderon Sol, 
who 
assumed the post less than two weeks ago. He, together with 
several of his Central American colleagues, defended the 
position that development should not be limited to the 
liberalization of commerce. 
  Violeta Chamorro of Nicaragua and Jose Maria Figueres of 
Costa Rica underscored the advances made by Central America in 
regard to integration, peace, and the consolidation of 
democracy. They also presented a regional model for a "feasible 
development" [desarrollo sostenible] based on social needs and 
respect for ecology. 
  Several presidents, such as Caldera, mentioned Spain and 
Portugal and asked that they become spokesmen for Latin America 
in Europe. 
  Uruguayan Luis Alberto Lacalle, however, noted the 
difference 
of interests between the Ibero-American countries and the 
summit's host, Cesar Gaviria, asked for a policy to attract 
investment to the region and expressed his hope that America 
will become a single commercial bloc.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera said tonight the time is right for Cuba 
to rejoin the OAS, but he added President Fidel Castro could 
make this process more viable. 
  "We are at the right time for Cuba to rejoin the hemispheric 
community of nations," said Caldera, recalling statements made 
by Portuguese President Mario Soares, who said Castro was "a man 
beyond suspicion." 
  Soares expressed respect and admiration for President 
Castro, 
saying "the Cold War ended, and the Berlin Wall fell; therefore, 
there are no reasons whatsoever why Cuba could not help abate 
the isolation it is in." 
  Caldera said the current conditions are propitious for the 
island to rejoin the OAS, but "it is also the time for Cuba to 
revise its domestic policies." 
  The Venezuelan president decried the blockade against Cuba, 
"because any unilateral blockade harms the people rather than a 
certain government." 
  Answering questions from the media, the Venezuelan chief of 
state said "neoliberal policies carried out at any price and 
policies of structural adjustment rigorously carried out in an 
orthodox manner have made us pay a very high social cost." 
  Caldera believes trade openings and processes of integration 
have benefited all nations, but "the exaggeration with which the 
neoliberal doctrine has been implemented has deteriorated 
society, and those peoples who elected us are demanding better 
and more humane living conditions," he said. 
  Caldera, along with 21 chiefs of state and government (in 
addition to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso), 
are attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will end 
on 15 June at this port, located 1,200 km from Santa Fe de 
Bogota along the Colombian Caribbean coast.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro did not discuss political reforms in Cuba during their 
meeting today, before the inauguration of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. 
  Spanish official sources revealed that the meeting, which 
lasted 40 minutes, focused on the process of economic reforms 
begun by Castro and the current crisis at the German and Belgian 
Embassies in Havana. 
  Gonzalez reiterated to Castro that Spain is willing to 
remain 
a financial consultant on the condition that, in the opinion of 
Gonzalez, reforms should lead to "a change of political 
circumstances." 
  As a result, Cuba should join the "democratizing trend of 
the 
Ibero-American group." 
  During the meeting -- referred to merely as "cordial" by the 
sources -- the two leaders reviewed the economic situation in 
the their respective countries, and Castro did not conceal the 
hardships his country is facing. 
  According to Felipe Gonzalez, there are only two paths to be 
taken in facing this crisis: to implement more in-depth reforms 
or to abstain from doing so, which would further exacerbate the 
situation. 
  Regarding the situation triggered by the occupation of the 
embassies of Belgium, where 18 people remain since 18 May, and 
Germany, where 20 people forcefully entered yesterday, Castro 
explained his position. Castro's position consists of "not 
allowing the escalation of conflicts of this type."

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The 
Central American governments have agreed not to receive Haitian 
refugees, as was requested by U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
official Central American sources have told EFE. 
  The matter of the refugees was discussed by the chiefs of 
state of the region who met yesterday in Costa Rica and later in 
the Colombian city of Cartagena, where the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit is being held today and tomorrow. 
  Although they have not made an official announcement en 
bloc, 
they decided not to accept the refugees, not even temporarily, 
sources from a Central American country who chose to remain 
anonymous have told EFE. 
  Clinton asked the governments of the Central American 
countries last month to accept the refugees fleeing the Haitian 
crisis, while it was decided whether their cases could be 
considered cases of economic or political emigration. If the 
cases were political, they would be admitted into the United 
States. 
  The request regarding the Haitian refugees was made directly 
to the six Central American presidents last month when they met 
in Tegucigalpa with U.S. Vice President Al Gore. 
  Several countries turned down the request because of 
economic 
or emigration problems in their respective countries. Others, 
such as Costa Rica and El Salvador, said unenthusiastically that 
they would consider the matter. 
  Honduras, which a couple of years ago gave asylum to a group 
of Haitians and later had problems assimilating them, had said 
beforehand that it could not receive any more refugees.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Central America today insisted on requesting democratic changes 
in Cuba in a statement by Costa Rican President Jose Maria 
Figueres within the framework of the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit. The statment proposes that the topic be discussed 
within the OAS. 
  The governments of the isthmus, who yesterday requested the 
island's democratization at the end of a regional summit in San 
Jose, are willing to meet with Cuban President Fidel Castro to 
ask him for political openness in Cuba, according to Figueres. 
  Figueres also suggested that the Cuban case "be reviewed by 
the Inter-American system in bloc," and he noted that the 
Colombian president's assumption of the OAS Secretariat in 
August will be "an important ingredient" for the matter to be 
taken up by a strengthened and invigorated organization. 
  This is not a case of creating obstacles but, rather, one in 
which the Central Americans want a peaceful solution to the 
Cuban situation, the Costa Rican president stated. 
  Figueres added: "More and greater progress must be achieved 
in the areas of democratization, freedom of speech, religion, 
domestic and foreign association, and others to promote a 
climate of understanding." 
  The Costa Rican president, who took office 8 May, said 
Cuba's 
situation is a legacy of the Cold War, adding that its 
resolution must mainly involve the various groups of Cubans. As 
an example of such a transition, he noted the case of the 
Central American countries "in which the securing of peace has 
been the fruit of concerted efforts and dialogue." 
  In terms of Cuba's democratization, he said, all of the 
members of the island, without distinction, including the 
dissident groups abroad and those in the country, must 
participate. However, "any planned transition" must strengthen 
and secure "the revolutionary achievements in the areas of 
education, health, and housing," he said. 
  Fidel Castro, who was the last president to arrive in 
Cartagena on Monday evening amid tight security, has again been 
the focus of attention of newsmen and chiefs of state attending 
the summit. 
  Argentine President Carlos Menem, who at last year's summit 
requested Cuba's democratization, told EFE that this is "the 
wish" not only of his country, but of many Latin American 
countries. He also noted that "there is no problem" in meeting 
with Castro, if he wishes to meet or if the opportunity exists 
within the framework of the summit. 
  The Cuban leader today surprised the summit participants by 
attending the opening ceremony wearing a guayabera shirt instead 
of the traditional olive drab uniform he has worn at previous 
summits.

  [Text] A meeting with Spanish King Juan Carlos was the 
first official activity that President Frei carried out in 
Cartagena, Colombia. Commenting on this meeting, Frei said that 
he discussed the current situation in Chile and his 
administrations' projects. 
  In addition, Frei reported that King Juan Carlos had 
expressed interest in paying another visit to Chile, and that 
some dates were already under discussion. 
  Asked about Chilean support for Cuba's return to the OAS,

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin by </F>
Guillermo Rodriguez in Cartagena de Indias on 14 June; from the 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Good morning, Minister Sanin. 
Congratulations on the summit's organization. What will happen 
with this summit in Cartagena de Indias? 
  [Sanin] Good morning. We will continue declaring an all-out 
war on poverty. We are working so that the integration, trade, 
and all our social policies improve living conditions for most 
Colombians. 
  [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the last issue of the 
CAMBIO 16 publication, there is a report by Isaac (Deacon) on 
you, Minister Sanin. It is virtually being assumed that after 7 
August, you will decide your future, and may decide to form your 
own political movement. Is there any truth to this? 
  [Sanin] I have been so busy with preparing the summit, among 
other international commitments. After 7 August, I will decide 
what I will do. 
  [Rodriguez] But you do not reject the possibility of 
becoming 
fully involved in politics? 
  [Sanin] Why impose conditions on our lives? I will be 
wherever I can serve Colombia best. 
  [Rodriguez] Following a brief diplomatic career, a one-year 
sabbatical.... 
  [Sanin] I truly cannot tell you what I will do yet. However, 
I obviously must rest a little. 
  [Rodriguez] We have heard that most heads of state are 
constantly encouraging you to become fully involved in politics. 
Will you heed their advice? 
  [Sanin] I must think about it, but I reiterate: after 7 
August. 
  [Rodriguez] What is the leading aspect of this summit? 
  [Sanin] The meeting of the 21 heads of state per se is a 
very 
significant event. Their commitment to promulgate social 
policies so that all these economic initiatives provide an 
answer to the everyday needs of the people is also crucial. 
This is so because any trade and integration efforts obviously 
lead to boosting economic growth, increasing jobs, greater 
opportunities for consumers regarding product prices and 
quality. However, the leading aspect is that we are waging a 
war on poverty. 
  [Rodriguez] How have other Latin American nations received 
the integration and free trade agreement signed by the 
presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela? 
  [Sanin] They have received the signing of this agreement 
with 
enthusiasm and respect because it opens many opportunities for 
all -- more jobs and brighter economic prospects. The existence 
of equality and making sure that this process begins yielding 
results for Colombians are pivotal for us. This process will 
not generate immediate results, but those results will come. 
  [Rodriguez] A constructive criticism that is raised with 
regard to summits is that they usually do not go beyond 
well-intentioned declarations because an organization or an 
executive body to implement them is missing. Could the Latin 
American Community of Nations become that body? What is your 
view in this regard? 
  [Sanin] [Words indistinct] of the Ibero-American community. 
Yesterday, I submitted a proposal to the foreign ministers on 
creating a follow-up mechanism for all cooperation plans and 
political agreements advanced by the presidents and heads of 
state. We will meet on 6 August, the eve of the inauguration of 
the incoming Colombian president, to determine the nature of 
this mechanism and the follow-up instruments for all education 
and health plans and the various agreements achieved during this 
summit. However, all the political agreements and all the 
prospects resulting from this summit in themselves are very 
important. This forum possibly gathers the largest number of 
heads of state. 
  [Rodriguez] President Gaviria will inaugurate the summit at 
0900. How long will his speech last? 
  [Sanin] I cannot squeal on [chivear] the president because I 
would be risking my job. Let us wait to hear it. 
  [Rodriguez] Speaking about the president, in that magazine 
report, you called yourself a Gavirist conservative. What does 
that mean? 
  [Sanin] It means that I am committed to this phase of 
changes, these radical changes, this new country Colombians have 
built under President Gaviria's lead. 
  [Rodriguez] Does it mean isolation from other factions of 
the 
Conservative Party? 
  [Sanin] No. What is currently happening is that politics is 
being viewed from a new perspective and a new situation. There 
is a different attitude and a different manner of conducting it. 
Beyond being only a conservative or a liberal, I truly admire 
and have a total commitment to how President Gaviria conducts 
politics. 
  [Rodriguez] Carlos Murcia in yesterday's issue of EL 
ESPECTADOR as well as CAMBIO 16, SEMANA, and CROMOS have 
suggested that you have a place in either Samper's or Pastrana's 
cabinet. Would you accept an offer from either Samper or 
Pastrana? 
  [Sanin] Neither CROMOS nor SEMANA nor any of the best media 
you mentioned are entitled to make nominations. Therefore, let 
us take one step at a time, and let us see what happens.

  [Text] Four more countries may join the Common Market of 
the South, Mercosur, which currently consists of Brazil, 
Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay. 
  On 15 July Amorim will attend a meeting in Argentina to 
evaluate the Chilean and Bolivian petitions to join Mercosur. 
Commenting in Cartagena on the Mercosur integration process, 
Amorim said: 
  [Begin Amorim recording] We regard as very positive the 
interest expressed by Bolivia and Chile in joining Mercosur as 
associates. We believe all this will strengthen Mercosur by 
opening up new trade prospects, and will also be instrumental in 
attracting other countries to endorse President Itamar Franco's 
proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area. In sum, I 
believe all this will be regarded as something very positive. 
[end recording] 
  Amorim added that much progress has been made in the talks 
with the governments of Colombia and Venezuela on their also 
taking part in Mercosur.

<F P=106> [Report by unnamed special correspondents] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena -- President Juan Carlos Wasmosy stated on 
13 June that Paraguay would condition Chile's admission to 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The president made this 
remark after studying the letter that the Chilean Foreign 
Ministry sent to Mercosur's Pro-Tempore Secretariat, in which it 
officially requests admission to the group consisting of the 
four River Plate nations. 
  The Paraguayan position is that Chile must adapt itself to 
the demands that will arise when it becomes a full-fledged 
member of Mercosur. The Chilean document requests an outline of 
the obligations it will have to comply with, but also gives to 
understand that it is not willing to comply with them. 
  The document, which is signed by the Chilean foreign 
minister, indicates that its admission will be accomplished 
through bilateral tariff protocols to be signed with each 
Mercosur member. These protocols presumably contain 
implementation regulations responding to the conditions and 
intents specified in bilateral relations, to be accomplished 
within a certain period of time. 
  It is precisely Chile, though, that will be setting this 
period of time, as well as the number of years that cannot be 
exceeded. 
  All of these demands are practically unacceptable to 
Paraguay, and therefore, according to official sources, Chile's 
possible admission to Mercosur must be very carefully studied. 
  On 13 June Wasmosy also confirmed that Paraguay will abstain 
from voting in the hypothetical case that the economic embargo 
against Cuba comes up for discussion. 
  The president announced this position, but did not explain 
why. Wasmosy also indicated that he does not agree with the 
military intervention in Haiti being considered by the United 
States, indicating that this would be his government's position 
if a decision has to be taken on the subject.

<F P=106> [By Rafael Candanedo] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- The 
chiefs of state and government, who are attending the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit, will call for a deepening of regional 
integration and economic expansion processes to revive their 
economies and create more jobs. 
  This goal is contained in the Cartagena de Indias 
Declaration, a 19-page document, which will be signed tomorrow 
by the leaders, as they close the two-day meeting that opened 
today at the Convention Center of this city on the Colombian 
Caribbean coast, a city that was declared a historic heritage of 
humanity. 
  The text, which was negotiated at initial meetings involving 
foreign ministers and technicians of 21 countries, promotes a 
reinforcement of economic relations and of the various 
integration processes. It followed the general topic of the 
meeting, "Trade and Integration as Factors for Ibero-American 
Development." 
  The document calls for the "convergence" of existing 
integration mechanisms, for an American trade liberalization, 
for the expansion of economic relations with all countries and 
regions, even with the Pacific Rim, and for an expansion of 
trade and investment between Latin America and the EU. As for 
the latter, the declaration points out that Spain and Portugal 
constitute "privileged points of contact" between the two 
continents. 
  This fourth summit was attended by 20 chiefs of state, and 
by 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, Portuguese Prime 
Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, and Vice President Carlos Morales, 
who represented Dominican Republic President Joaquin Balaguer, 
87, who was advised by his doctors to not travel due to his 
glaucoma problem. 
  "It is expected that the liberalization process and the 
promotion of multilateral trade and investment will create new 
and necessary vigor for international economic activity that 
will bring about and higher employment levels," the final 
document states. 
  The Ibero-American summit voices hope that GATT and its 
future transformation into the World Trade Organization, in 
keeping with an agreement signed in April, will be an instrument 
that will help strengthen the sector's multilateral system. 
  The declaration states that the pact clearly regulates the 
commercial stands of the countries, strengthens mechanisms to 
settle controversies, and decreases the risk of applying 
unilateral measures to protect inefficient sectors of the 
economy. 
  The spirit of open regionalism, which should rule the 
regional integration processes, is considered to be a complement 
of the main elements of development such as the strengthening of 
the democratic system, access to new technologies, macroeconomic 
stability, economic revival, social cohesion, and environmental 
policies. 
  The Cartagena summit reviewed such Latin American 
sub-regional integration agreements as the Central American 
Integration System, the Free Trade Agreement of the Group of 
Three (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Caribbean Common 
Market (Caricom), the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), and 
the complementary economic pacts within the framework of the 
Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
  The summit also mentioned the importance of the Brazilian 
proposal to create a South American Free Trade Area (ALCSA) 
based on Mercosur and pointed out that NAFTA, signed by the 
United States, Mexico, and Canada, will have reverberating 
effects throughout the American continent. 
  The rulers are recommending the strengthening of Latin 
American-European relations in order to promote a balanced trade 
by means of identifying the adequate mechanisms to hold talks 
and to promote cooperation. 
  In addition, the heads of state are advocating the 
modernization of state apparatuses through programs to modernize 
and minimize bureaucratic procedures, increases in the 
participation of the private sector in the construction of 
infrastructure, and the creation of a scientific community. 
  In what constitutes a direct reference to the historic 
dispute between the United States and Cuba, the Cartagena de 
Indias Declaration advocates the elimination of "coercive" and 
unilateral economic and commercial measures that could affect 
free international trade movements and could "hamper" the Latin 
American peoples' living conditions. 
  For the past 32 years, the United States has imposed an 
economic and commercial embargo on Cuba as a punishment, because 
leader Fidel Castro implemented a communist political system in 
1959. 
  The Fifth Ibero-American Summit will take place next year in 
Argentina, possibly at the tourist resort city of San Carlos de 
Bariloche, in southern Argentina.

  [Excerpts] Belem -- Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
yesterday requested that rich countries supply greater resources 
with which to fight narcotics trafficking. He made this request 
at a news conference held after delivering his closing speech at 
the 24th OAS General Assembly in this, the capital city of Para 
State. Amorim noted that because funding for drug enforcement 
operations is very limited in Brazil, it is very important for 
our country to receive financial cooperation from countries 
where drugs are consumed. 
  Amorim said: Drug-producing countries are receiving 
resources to implement alternative crops. Yet countries that 
are being used as drug routes have not received the same kind of 
support. [passage omitted] 
  Amorim also emphasized the significance of the 
Ibero-American 
summit scheduled to open next week in Colombia, and especially 
the presence there of the heads of government of Spain and 
Portugal, which are member countries of the European Union and 
leading counterparts in our trade talks with Europe. 
  Amorim said: The path to follow appears to be one marked by 
greater trade liberalization between the European Union and 
Latin American subregional groups, the Common Market of the 
South included. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech by President Fidel Castro at the Fourth </F>
Ibero-American Summit at the India Catalina Convention Center in 
Cartagena de Indias -- live] 
  [Text] Esteemed President of Colombia Cesar Gaviria, Your 
Majesty, Excellencies: Our summits, initiated in Guadalajara, 
have been an inspiring example for our countries to draw closer 
and to unify. We have reaffirmed our decision to meet without 
the permission of third countries and without any significant 
exclusions. Our efforts have borne fruit in many respects; the 
advances of the Latin American Integration Association, the 
Andean Group, the Central American Common Market, the Southern 
Cone Common Market, and the increasingly important Latin 
American economic system demonstrate this. 
  It seems that some were worried by this new, independent 
method of action. Our powerful northern neighbor now calls for 
another summit that is to take place in Miami, of all places; it 
is for a mature hemispheric association. There have already 
been alliances for progress and initiatives for the Americas 
that no one remembers today. From decade to decade and centery 
to century, we have gone from slogan to slogan, from deceit to 
deceit. There were also wars, interventions, and conquest of 
territories at the expense of our America. What can we expect 
from that powerful country, invariably expansionistic, 
egotistic, and hegemonic. 
  Cuba, a country attacked and blockaded for over 30 years, is 
prohibited by the alleged owners of the hemisphere to 
participate in that meeting. How much cowardice, mediocrity, 
and political poverty is truly reflected by this exclusion. 
Cuba does not oppose, however, that summit. We are pleased 
that the brother countries of Latin America and the Caribbean 
will have an opportunity there to defend with complete firmness 
and strength the interests of our peoples. 
  First of all, it is time to demand a right to healthcare; 
education; an honest paying job; a cultural and ethnic identity; 
that all forms of racial and sexual discrimination cease, an end 
to abandoned and homeless children as well as victims of all 
types of exploitation, violence, and sexual abuse; an end to 
honger; a cessation of conditions that allow millions of people 
to die each year who could be saved. These are among the 
fundamental rights of man and should be respected. 
  Cuba has resolutedly supported the revolutionary struggle 
for 
democratic processes in Central and South America and is happy 
that the current U.S. Administration will not foster, as others 
have done, cruel military dictatorships subordinate to U.S. 
interests. Cuba cannot tolerate U.S. efforts to become the 
model and supreme judge of Latin American political guidelines. 
  Cuba determinedly defends the principle of national 
sovereignty. It would be willing to defer only to a united Latin 
America, but under no circumstances will it tolerate the 
meddling of U.S. power circles in the internal affairs of 
countries in the region. 
  Nothing would please Cuba more than to see the United States 
offer all countries of the region, especially the lower income 
countries, free access to its markets as a contribution to the 
economic development of those countries. 
  Cuba also finds foreign investment, including U.S. 
investments, necessary as a contribution to development on this 
continent, but Cuba is concerned about the denationalization of 
important sources of wealth and natural resources, a process 
under way in the countries of the region. 
  Trade and foreign investments are not enough to guarantee 
the 
development of national economies. It is necessary to increase 
the influx of development aid, something that the current U.S. 
Government has reduced. 
  Now that the Cold War is over, that country should use part 
of its currently unjustifiable military expenditures to 
establish a fund to promote the development of Latin American 
and Caribbean countries. 
  The United States should foster a radical and definite 
solution to the region's foreign debt, which is already $487 
billion. It should stop using intellectual property as a 
negotiating weapon. It must derogate the arbitrary Super-301 
special disposition that unilaterally punishes trade partners. 
It must exempt the Latin American and Caribbean countries from 
the brutal demand of having unrestricted access to services, a 
demand imposed at the Uruguay Round. 
  Cuba is happy that the United States is proposing, at least 
theoretically, the implementation of what it has called second 
generation economic reforms to resolve the continent's social 
problems. The resources allocated for this, however, are 
absolutely insufficient. 
  Cuba is pleased to hear that the United States wants to 
modify inter-American security precepts prevalent during the 
Cold War and to work for a new relationship not connected to the 
presence of U.S. military bases in the region. 
  To be consistent with that policy, the United States must 
dismantle the Guantanamo Naval Base and return to Cuba a 
territory it has occupied for almost 100 years. 
  It must withdraw its bases from Panama, as the treaty 
establishes, and from any other Latin American country. 
  If the United States is concerned about sustainable 
development in the region and environmental pollution, it must 
sign Agenda 21 of the Rio summit. 
  Cuba agrees with the establishment of mechanisms of 
hemispheric cooperation to fight drug trafficking. This must not 
be at the expense of the sovereignty of the involved countries, 
however. 
  The concerns of the continent's armed forces which refuse to 
act as counternarcotics policemen are valid. The demands for a 
reduction in U.S. drug consumption are also valid. 
  The United States must change its immigration policies for 
Latin America and the Caribbean. It must promulgate a law that 
automatically legalizes the status of citizens from this region 
who enter the United States, as it is doing with Cuba's citizens. 
  Now that the Berlin Wall no longer exists, the wall erected 
along the Mexican-U.S. border should come down. 
  Cuba deems positive the U.S. idea of convoking the 
continent's nongovernmental organizations to make 
recommendations about the agenda, but all such organizations 
must be invited and the demands of Indians, women, peasant 
organizations, labor unions, and other representatives of civil 
societies, who have much to say about the issues to be discussed 
at the summit, must also be heard without unfair exclusions. 
  Finally, this is a fitting occasion to demand that the 
United 
States comply with the UN resolutions on the criminal and unjust 
blockade against Cuba, the intention of which is to spill blood 
and force our people to surrender out of hunger. 
  If these issues are discussed at the Miami summit, Cuba 
wishes it success, but if all it comes down to is an attempt to 
draw lines on the hemisphere, to isolate Cuba, to control the 
Latin American and Caribbean market, and to check Europe, Japan, 
and the rest of the world, then we would have to recall what 
Jose Marti said in judging a similar meeting that took place in 
Washington 105 years ago: After seeing with inquiring eyes the 
record, rationale, and factors involved in the invitation, it is 
necessary to say, because it is true, that the time has come for 
Spanish America to declare its second independence. 
  Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Demetrio Villaurrutia from Colombia] </F>
  [Text] Our commander in chief's first address during the 14 
June morning session of the fourth Ibero-American summit was 
followed by another address by Fidel. This was a closed-door 
session held at the Convention Center. The address came during a 
debate regarding democracy in Latin America, which included a 
clear reference to Cuba. Brazilian President Itamar Franco then 
stated that the only way Latin American people can help is by 
joining efforts to support Cuba and its reintegration to the 
OAS. This motivated Fidel to speak and I believe it is important 
for all our listeners throughout Cuba to listen to his words. 
  [Begin Castro recording] I want to -- since my country, 
Cuba, 
has been mentioned repeatedly by several of the speakers -- 
first of all give thanks to those who care about Cuba. I can 
feel a sincerity in what they have said. This is why I have 
applauded each one. I know that at times, when I speak, some do 
not applaud. That is fine. I respect that. I believe this is a 
democratic thing and each has to do what they believe is 
pertinent. I have applauded everyone, some more enthusiastically 
than others. From everyone I have truly felt -- and I thank you 
for it -- a concern for Cuba. 
  It caught my attention, however -- this is why I appreciate 
so much President Itamar Franco's gesture -- that not a word has 
been said about the unfair, criminal, and inhuman blockade which 
for over 30 years has been imposed against Cuba, the largest 
ever blockade in the history of a Latin American country with 
which no dialogue is sought. What is sought is to smother Cuba 
in blood and make it surrender by hunger. This is the reality. 
  I would have liked to hear within that Latin American spirit 
some reference to this. I believe our people also deserve 
commendation if we keep in mind the heroism, firmness, and 
dignity with which hey have resisted for over 30 years the U.S. 
blockade and aggression. Later on, we were left alone. Many, 
when left alone, surrender. Yet we have not surrendered. We have 
continued fighting because we are aware that we are defending 
the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the peoples of 
Latin America. This is, precisely, what Marti wanted with Cuba's 
independence. 
  It amazes me that not a word has been said to the effect 
that 
Cuba is the country which has advanced the most, socially, in 
the history of this hemisphere. We have done so much that I 
believe we have done more than what was possible. Not a single 
word has been said, as we speak about the social crisis in this 
hemisphere and so many closed schools, to the effect that our 
country, subjected to a double blockade, has not closed a single 
hospital, a single school, has not abandoned anyone. Our 
country, even under the most difficult conditions, has struggled 
and resisted. 
  In a hemisphere, which as you know well, whatever our 
current, present, or definitive -- as you will -- 
accomplishments may be, which please me to no end....[pauses ] 
We know, however, that this hemisphere where we all live, has 
the worst distribution in the whole wide world by far. I am 
talking about our region, with exceptions, of course, in certain 
countries. This is the region with the worst distribution of 
national income in the world and where so much remains to be 
done. Yet, not a single word is said about it. 
  It also surprises me that not a single word has been said 
about the joint position which we should present at the 
notorious Miami summit. This is very important, vital, and 
looming close. 
  Finally, I would like to state that I respect your views. I 
sincerely respect your thoughts, concepts, and ideas about 
democracy. We should hold a summit to discuss what is democracy 
and what is meant by people's participation; what does it mean 
that millions of people die in this hemisphere every year from 
disease and hunger, millions who could be saved. It is our duty 
to think about all of this if we are democratic, if we are human. 
  We have our ideas and views on democracy and do not feel 
ashamed of them. With these views, we have resisted and 
struggled for 35 years. I believe the blows we have endured 
during these 35 years -- we cannot forget history -- since we 
were first blockaded, way before the declaration of the 
socialist character of the Revolution, when we were blockaded 
and our sugar quota was apportioned among all ....[pauses] Cuba 
was left practically alone with the highly noble exception of 
Mexico which maintained ties and relations with us. I respect 
everyone's views. I believe that if we are to speak about 
democracy, we have to speak of a multiplicity of views and 
opinions. I ask that our views be respected in the same manner 
that we respect yours. This said, I thank you once more for the 
concern you have expressed regarding Cuba. Thank you very much. 
[applause] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Augusto Martinez, executive director of </F>
Colombia's Chamber of Commerce of Cartagena de Indias, by Pedro 
Otero, in Cartagena de Indias; date not given; from the "Evening 
Information Review" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Otero] Does the Cartegena de Indias Chamber of 
Commerce have any kind of relationship with the Cuban Chamber of 
Commerce? Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba are sister 
cities through a decision by their respective mayoralties. I 
believe they probably have some sort of ties. Cartagena de 
Indias is a Caribbean city. I believe the Cartagena de Indias 
Chamber of Commerce might approach Caribbean countries. The 
Association of Caribbean States will be established soon, and I 
believe Colombia will be part of that organization. 
  [Martinez] Since the resumption of relations between Cuba 
and 
Colombia, Cartagena de Indias has benefited greatly from this 
new phase of relations with Cuba, and due to certain 
characteristics and agreements on many aspects -- economic, 
geographical, and cultural -- we have maintained close contacts 
with the Cuban delegation in Colombia. 
  We have already established a number of contacts -- in 
addition to the establishment of a fraternal relationship 
between Cartagena de Indias and Santiago de Cuba that you 
mentioned -- after holding meetings with the Cuban Embassy and 
charge d'affaires to study the possibilities, and we are 
virtually organizing a number of activities, beginning with a 
business mission from Cartagena de Indias and the entire 
Atlantic Coast to Cuba, which we will organize. 
  We are planning to organize this group in July, and we want 
to involve businessmen not only from Cartagena de Indias but 
also from Barranquilla and other areas along the coast because, 
according to information we have received from the ambassador 
and the charge d'affaires, there are enormous possibilities to 
establish two-way exchanges, not only from Colombia to Cuba, but 
there are also many business activities in Cuba that are 
competitive. 
  With the opening and the tourist boom in Cuba, the island, 
its businessmen, and its tourist sector require a number of 
goods and services that are not being offered. There is an 
enormous potential there. Colombian businessmen could find a 
market; in fact, some have already approached us to establish a 
direct relationship with Cuban businessmen through the 
Association of Businessmen and the Cuban Chamber of Commerce. 
  We have not yet had official contact with the Cuban Chamber 
of Commerce. We have started efforts given the possibility of 
organizing this mission. We hope to invite not only the Cuban 
Chamber of Commerce but also the chambers of commerce of the 
entire Caribbean area to a meeting in Cartagena de Indias, 
possibly next year, of Caribbean chambers of commerce and 
businessmen affiliated with them.

<F P=106> [Remarks by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and </F>
Cuban President Fidel Castro at the Mexican Embassy in Havana on 
13 June; from the "NTV" newscast -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Salinas] Comrades, Cuban friends: This is an 
especially important visit. A visit to Cuba can never be 
considered a mere stopover en route to other nations, even for a 
Mexican president. It is a vital visit. Just being here makes 
a statement. I want this visit to be deep and broad in content 
and not just a formal visit. In summarizing what has been 
discussed and agreed upon over this long and intense period, I 
would said that two essential elements turned this visit into a 
very important state visit for the Mexican president. 
  First, we have reaffirmed what is clear to many: No one 
should forget the affectionate, lasting, and permanent 
relationship between the Cuban and Mexican peoples, a 
relationship that is neither affected nor diminished by 
circumstances or events. [applause] 
  Second, the intensity, depth, and significance of this visit 
have translated into specific results in the effort to 
strengthen ties. Cuba and Mexico have established economic, 
financial, and commercial ties to their benefit. On this 
occasion, I am pleased to note that we were able to realize what 
took months of intense talk and negotiation among several 
Mexican businessmen, namely a Cuban- Mexican association. This 
alone is a great step forward and shows that we can build this 
relationship with solid brick, on a strong foundation and with 
deep roots. There will always be a place in the Mexican 
people's heart and mind for the beloved and respected people of 
Cuba. 
  [Castro] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, esteemed 
Mexican and Cuban brothers: I knew I was not going to get out of 
having to speak. [laughter] We are true slaves to the clock and 
must stick strictly to the agenda. This is why I will only say 
that we have broken several Olympic records here. First, this 
is the shortest official visit we have had. This must be noted 
in the Guiness Book of Records. Second, many things have been 
accomplished during this visit. President Salinas' ability to do 
things quickly is truly admirable. Third, another Olympic record 
involves the friendship, warmth, trust, and brotherhood which 
President Salinas has given to every issue and aspects he has 
already explained. 
  This is not a stopover. A stopover is what I am doing here, 
at the Mexican Embassy, before moving ahead. [laughter] 
  This outstanding official visit has been very good and 
productive. Visiting Cuba today is an act of courage, given the 
magnitude of the campaign against Cuba. Therefore, the Mexican 
president and his delegation have carried out a courageous and 
admirable act. [applause] We will always remember and be 
eternally grateful. 
  Looking at the clock, we will have to run as fast as we can, 
without getting ourselves killed, to meet the agenda and be at 
the airport by 1700. [laughter] Another record has been set: I 
have delivered my briefest speech ever. Thank you. [laughter, 
applause]

  [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Cuban authorities 
reinforced surveillance at diplomatic missions, particularly 
Latin American ones, in Havana following the entry of 20 Cubans 
into the German Embassy. The streets surrounding the Belgium 
and German Embassies, where two groups of Cubans have entered in 
the past weeks, remain closed to vehicle traffic. The 
diplomatic missions of Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina are 
heavily guarded. 
  Diplomatic sources view this deployment of police forces as 
a 
preventive measure in light of likely incidents at other 
embassies while the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is being held. 
  The recent situation triggered by the crashing of a truck 
carrying 21 persons -- 18 men and three women -- on Monday into 
the German Embassy so as to request political asylum remains the 
same, and seemingly, no changes have taken place. 
  German Embassy sources consulted by EFE today refused to 
comment and limited themselves to referring questions to the 
Foreign Ministry in Bonn. Foreign Ministry spokesmen in Bonn 
indicated that their government is seeking a European solution 
for the Cubans inside their embassy and the Belgian ambassador's 
residence in Havana. The German Embassy and the Belgian 
ambassador's residence are only a few city blocks apart in the 
Miramar neighborhood. 
  The same source noted that the Cuban refugees are refusing 
to 
leave the embassy if their situation is not resolved. This 
stand is similar to that adopted by a group of 100 Cubans who 
have occupied the Belgian residence for two weeks. Only seven 
persons have left thus far. 
  A diplomatic source told EFE that currently, the European 
embassies maintain normal contacts regarding these cases, and 
that at any moment, the EU ambassadors could meet to discuss the 
situation at the German Embassy. 
  In either case, the Cuban Government has insisted on 
pointing 
out that this is an "illegal" action that in no way can replace 
regular procedures for leaving the island. Yesterday, the Cuban 
Government referred to the incident at the German Embassy as "a 
carefully planned and unacceptable act." 
  Meanwhile, the Belgian Government said the 117 refugees must 
leave the residence peacefully and follow legal emigration 
procedures. They have indicated, however, that the conflict 
will not be easily resolved because of the refugees' resistance.

  [Text] A total of 400 people nationwide have been charged 
with illegal vehicle sales so far. In Havana, there are 
approximately 3,000 cases of automobiles and motorcycles 
involved in transactions through powers of attorney, one of the 
most frequently used ways to give vehicle sales violations a 
legal face. Investigations are underway to determine whether 
transactions that involved a number of vehicles that have 
changed hands were legal.

  [Text] General Raul Castro, minister of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces [FAR], has participated in the extended military 
council of the Central Army conducted by Division General 
Joaquin Quintas Solas. Commander of the Revolution Juan Almeida 
Bosque and Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, both 
members of the Politburo, were also present. 
  The military council of the Central Army agreed to further 
increase defense training levels, to give priority to the unit's 
seven main guidelines, to continue agricultural and fish farming 
development, and to emphasize self-financing. In this way, they 
hope to attain the best command status of the interarms 
emulation program. 
  The agenda covered various topics of interest. Porfirio 
Rodriguez, chief of the General Staff of the Central Army, 
offered an overall view of the efforts of this command, 
including efficient training of the troops, improvement of the 
army's structure, the satisfactory preservation of combat 
equipment and weapons, permanent commitment to preparation of 
the theater of military operations, and fulfillment of tasks 
ensuring capabilities and full combat readiness and the [words 
indistinct]. 
  Topics related to the Armed Forces' self-sufficiency, 
particularly in this region, were also discussed. Martinez, 
chief engineer of the army's farming detachment, described the 
improvements in food self-sufficiency, such as plans -- already 
progressing well -- to increase production by 30 percent in 
comparison with last year. They have 325 hectares dedicated to 
fish farming and also to raise chickens and pigs. The meeting 
also emphasized the need to control production costs and 
eliminate subsidies until profits are attained for contributing 
to the self-financing of FAR. Raul pointed that in order to do 
this, it is essential to keep strict accounts. 
  A special address was given by Jose Luis Rodriguez, minister 
of finance and pricing, who cited the steps taken by the 
government to mend the country's finances, measures already 
adopted and others being prepared, such as the tax system for 
certain nonsalary incomes. He also pointed out the importance of 
the budget as a central element in the economy, and the 
importance of restoring accounting and auditing in attaining 
financial discipline. On this subject, Raul highlighted the 
words of the commander in chief on the necessity to reestablish 
economic discipline by all means, and added: 
  [Begin Castro recording, in progress] ...the total or 
general 
discipline of the country. The first step is to stop impunity in 
every aspect and sector. [end recording] 
  Tomas Cardenas and Manuel Menendez, first secretaries of the 
Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], in Villa Clara and Cienfuegos 
respectively, gave briefings on the political, economic, and 
social situation of their provinces and the work carried out by 
the PCC to overcome the current difficulties. 
  The excellent work accomplished in the municipality of 
Caibarien on defense, the food plan, and the links between the 
PCC and the masses was pointed out as a valuable experience 
worth study by other municipalities. 
  Div. Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro, vice minister of the FAR, 
congratulated everyone for the satisfactory condition of the 
army and its solid, stable combat readiness to defend the 
region. This was reiterated by Raul on behalf of Almeida, who is 
a founding member of this command, and himself. 
  [Begin recording] [Castro] This is the most stable command; 
yet it is in the vanguard. [end recording] 
  Finally, Div. Gen. Quintas Solas challenged the other 
armies, 
stressing that the Central Army will strive to achieve the best 
command status. 
  [Begin recording] [Quintas] Firmly rooted in the glorious 
era 
of the vigorous rebellions of slaves, in the land soaked in 
Mambi and the rebel blood of the immortal army of Gomez and 
Maceo, Camilo and Che, in the 5 September streets quenched with 
heroism, in the mountains where we defeated the bandits, and in 
the glorious sands where imperialism sustained its first great 
defeat in Latin America, the fighting people of the Central Army 
work together with you to guarantee, at any cost, the sacred 
defense of the fatherland. [end recording] 
  This tour through the Central Army was reassuring to those 
accompanying the FAR minister since it was evident that the 
Armed Forces is headed in the right direction, and is increasing 
its ties with the people.

<F P=106> [Interview with Brigadier General Samuel Rodiles Planas by </F>
reporter Hector Rodriguez, on the "This Very Day" program on 14 
June, monitored in progress -- live] 
  [Text] [Rodiles] ...of unit troops. I remember our first 
maneuver in 1962, directed by the head of the Army, Commander 
Guillermo [not further identified]. I mention this as a 
comparison to our Western Army's preparedness then and now. I 
should mention that this took place in 1962, and the Army was 
founded on 14 June of that same year. 
  The maneuvers began and we were assigned to carry out 
offensive maneuvers. I was the head of Division 1270, and 
Military Unit 2424 was subordinate to our unit, which was headed 
by then Captain Mario [not further identified], regarding all 
equipment, and we were unable to communicate with any of the 
subordinate units. [chuckles] 
  [Rodriguez] So, there has been a total change. 
  [Rodiles] Yes, a very significant change. That is where we 
realized we were lacking a lot of military preparation. We went 
through other things as well. 
  I mention this example because an immense majority of those 
soldiers filled officer ranks in the new Army. But as time 
passed, the Army began to grow in knowledge and experience. I 
also wanted to point out that after the collapse of the former 
Soviet Union, our academies and military schools began offering 
the advanced military courses that were offered in the USSR, 
with the same efficiency as in the former USSR. 
  Today, we have more than 114,500 combatants and 
internationalists in our western territory. That figure includes 
combatants, from the production and defense brigades to our main 
units, as well as reserves. In that, we can see the great combat 
experience that our Army has acquired. All the officers and 
specialists, after graduating from military schools, went on to 
the General Staff and the troops, and once again received the 
practical knowledge of how to lead the troops in a modern 
battle. That is how we continued strengthening ouselves in 
theoretical principles, as well as in the practical knowledge of 
leading the troops. 
  Beginning in the 1980's, the doctrine of the people's war 
began to be taught. Our main leader, the commander in chief, and 
the minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR], realized 
that it was necessary to develop this type of defense in all its 
aspects since the defense of our socialist fatherland would 
eventually depend on our, the FAR's, and the Cuban people's 
effort and knowledge. That is how, in the eighties, the concept 
of the people's war was established and taught. 
  I do not exaggerate when I say that since then, we have 
trained tens of thousands of cadres and militants in the 
Territorial Troops Militia [MTT]. This is in addition to the 
preparation given our recruits and officers, who have gone 
through our command to create the real conditions to carry out 
that sacred mission assigned 33 years ago. In this concept of 
the people's war, we have linked ourselves more and more to the 
production and defense brigades, the defense zones, the 
municipalities, the MTT's. In a nutshell, the concept of the 
people's war is of the working and revolutionary people. 
  Together with the increase in volume of the equipment and 
quality of the armaments, we have carried out and continue to 
carry out serious work in the preparation of the military 
operations theater. We have the experience of the war in Iraq. 
At this moment, our armaments and equipment are ready to 
counterattack an enemy attack. It has the necessary vitality and 
conditions to carry out the mission successfully. 
  Taking all this into account and faced with the question of 
what our Western Army represents today, I would say it defends 
the largest territory of our country. It includes the capital of 
our Republic, where the leadership of the party and the Army, 
the revolutionary government, and a large part of the important 
industries in our country and objectives of such importance are 
located. 
  The armaments that our Army has are significant in power and 
capacity. If this is an important objective, since the country's 
leadership is located here, we believe this is of strategic 
importance. And for its defense -- I am not revealing any 
secrets by saying this -- we have troops who can guarantee the 
success of that mission and form part of the country's strategic 
goals. We understand the high responsibility that the Western 
Army has because of its sacred and historic mission. 
  I wanted to conclude by pointing out that on one occasion, 
the commander in chief stated that we would defend that sky, 
this flag, and this land regardless of the cost. To our 
commander in chief, we say the Western Army, beginning with its 
head, will defend the capital of the nation regardless of the 
cost and conditions. It will never surrender to an enemy 
aggression. We are sure of this. 
  [Rodriguez] General, I know there is competition -- I have 
called it beautiful competition -- among the three armies. Well, 
there is also the Youth Labor Army [EJT], but they do not have 
the same characteristics. They are the fourth Army. But the 
Western, Central, and Eastern Armies are competing to be the 
best and most outstanding command. I would like for you to 
address this. 
  [Rodiles] Hector, a pure, healthy, beautiful competition 
exists among comrades. This competition is fraternal and 
fruitful. We have no doubt that the FAR will be who ends up 
winning because the results will be greater preparation, 
capacity, and combat readiness to defend the fatherland, the 
Revolution, and the achievements of socialism. Nevertheless, the 
Western Army has the conditions of being named the first 
command. In other words, it is in condition to be given the 
honor of best command of the FAR. 
  [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the Eastern Army. 
  [Rodiles] Today, our dear brother Espinosa of the Eastern 
Army has it. 
  Last year, the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces 
[Minfar] held its inspection. We were also part of that 
inspection. It was a rigorous inspection. We obtained the high 
grade of good. That inspection demonstrated the morale and 
enthusiasm of all our comrades as well as the party and 
government leaders of the provinces and municipalities, the 
defense zones, and the production and defense brigades. This 
inspection covered the military aspects, as well as the aspect 
of the defense directed by the party and the government etc., 
and we were graded as good. That result was demonstrated. 
  The inspection also demonstrated the ties, cooperation, and 
harmony that exists between the people's defense forces and the 
Western Army. Once again, it demonstrated the great affinity 
that exists between the Minfar and the military commands that 
were being inspected. 
  The increase in the military operations theater is 
significant. I have already mentioned that it guarantees the 
vitality of the forces and equipment that will carry out such 
important missions. The political morale and discipline are 
high. Without discipline, there is nothing, as the minister of 
the FAR has said. We have reached first place in the 
conservation of armaments and equipment -- and a colonel who has 
already been here can attest to this. 
  The agricultural-livestock sector is also very important. 
Raul challenged us to increase production by 30 percent. In some 
areas, it is much more than 30 percent: tubers, grains, and fish 
breeding. In self-sufficiency, our military heads have the basic 
economic training to establish an inventory of goods produced. 
Because of all this, we believe we will reach first place. 
  [Rodriguez] You are still in the fight. 
  [Rodiles] Yes, we are still in the fight. [words indistinct] 
victorious and invincible in Havana at 33 years of age. Today, 
our Army is 33 years old. At that age, we will dedicate the 
achievement of obtaining first place in this fraternal 
competition to our commander in chief. 
  [Rodriguez] I know there is a strong competition and it is a 
competition in which the FAR will be the winner. The FAR will 
perfect itself during this competition. I know that the best 
command is the Eastern Army, but this year you hope to obtain 
that distinction. There is one topic, to conclude, that has been 
stressed. The minister has emphasized this. We are talking about 
the attention to the soldiers and officers. I would like you to 
discuss this briefly. 
  [Rodiles] This is one of our main areas of work, which has 
been stressed by the commander in chief, as well as by the 
minister of the FAR. Despite the critical and difficult 
conditions that we are all aware of, brought about by this 
special period in peacetime, we have not wavered in our 
attention to the workers in general. We continue working to 
perfect living and working conditions for all categories of 
personnel in the Western Army. In some units, we are even 
working intensively to complete housing before 26 July to 
improve those conditions. 
  In the recreational, cultural, and tourist areas, we are 
improving centers for the relaxation of our troops and officers 
in general. This year, several thousands of comrades, officers, 
and their families enjoy this attention to the worker. Beginning 
this year, we are going to at least duplicate the conditions and 
possibilities so our personnel can enjoy those vacations and 
recreational and cultural activities. 
  To conclude, I want to say that we have an ambitious plan to 
build low-cost housing to improve the living conditions of our 
officers and their families, a large number of whom are living 
at the military unit due to the shortage in housing that we all 
know about. The officers, their relatives, and friends work in 
the construction of the houses. In other words, it is a family 
effort which will make them appreciate the houses even more. 
  [Rodriguez] Brig. Gen. Samuel Rodiles, thank you for your 
participation on this program.

<F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant Colonel Sandino Fernandez, deputy </F>
chief of the Playa Giron Fighter Brigade, by Eduardo Gonzalez at 
Playa Giron on 14 June; interview opens with one Major Chamizo 
answering a telephone call and the "Alert Position One" order, 
followed by an air raid siren; from the "First Thing" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Gonzalez] We are with the Playa Giron Fighter 
Brigade, celebrating the Western Army's 33d anniversary. The 
pilot has two minutes to take off for this air patrol exercise. 
We will talk with Lieutenant Colonel Sandino Fernandez, deputy 
chief of the base, in the meantime. 
  This type of unit consumes a lot of fuel, lubricants, and 
electricity. How do you manage to maintain a high degree of 
combat training and readiness with only one-third of the energy 
resources? 
  [Fernandez] First, many of the problems that we used to 
solve 
through consuming energy are now solved through our comrades' 
ingenuity and intelligence. We have developed flight simulators 
that cost pennies to operate to maintain training levels 
comparable to years ago. 
  [Gonzalez] I want to tell our listeners that the MiG-29 
motor 
is already running and that Major Chamizo is aboard. 
  [Fernandez] The simulators save having to conduct flights, 
which cost between $6,000 and $7,000. They make it possible to 
train the pilots -- although without the psychological impact of 
a real flight -- on the ground for pennies. It costs about one 
or two cents in terms of electricity, even with the new electric 
fees. 
  [Gonzalez] The air patrol is taking off. It has been one 
minute and 50 seconds since the alert call came in. Of course, 
our pilots conduct real flight exercises to maintain their 
proficiency. Several related tasks are conducted in every 
exercise to conserve resources. 
  [Fernandez] We have developed devices, modeled on the 
bicycle 
gear, that allow us to forego the use of trucks, trucks used to 
charge batteries, and trucks used to cool the air on the 
airplanes. We have mounted air tanks and air conditioning 
equipment on bicycles and tricycles. This allows us to prepare 
the equipment without using fuel. We have also managed to 
reduce electric consumption to a minimum. We use electricity 
only in those instances when it is necessary.

  [Text] Sugar workers from Santiago de Cuba and other 
provinces will work hard not only to harvest the last bit of 
sugarcane but also to properly prepare for the next harvest 
under adverse conditions. This commitment was made to the 
provincial Communist Party of Cuba leadership during an 
assessment of the results of the last 10 days of the harvest. 
The province has already surpassed the production level 
attained in the last harvest and is gearing up to complete the 
remaining sugar production. This goal implies establishing a 
link between the cane waiting to be processed and the mills with 
higher production capacities. This vital final period is 
getting the support of the manual and combine workers from mills 
that have completed operations. 
  Only the Rafael Reyes, Salvador Rosales, and America Libre 
Mills have met their sugar production goals to date. 
Recognizing their success, Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado 
Ventura and Esteban Lazo instructed the management of those 
mills to present labor feat banners to their respective workers. 
  Machado Ventura stated that together with the efforts that 
the current harvest demands, it is necessary to guarantee, by 
every means, the sugarcane spring planting campaign. This makes 
it necessary for Santiago de Cuba to increase the daily pace to 
keep up with the program. Esteban Lazo stated this is why we 
need to take advantage of the days remaining in June to get 
ahead without neglecting crop tending tasks.

<F P=106> [Interview with agronomist Justina Reve by journalist </F>
Diosdado Maso in Granma Province for the "Doing Radio" program 
-- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Maso] Granma Province will have to double its 
efforts with agrarian products to fulfill some of its residents' 
needs. Granma has not escaped the special period's rigors 
regarding tuber production. Perhaps it will have to change its 
production plans, 68 percent of which is dedicated to plantains, 
50 percent of the province's total production. There are many 
problems, however; the province needs fertilizer for 24 of the 
800 caballerias that have been sowed. It has 12 tons of fuel 
when it actually needs 36 tons, and it has less than half the 
manpower needed to tend this crop. Could the plan be responsible 
for a low yield and Granma's inability to meet the demands for 
tubers and vegetables? Well, since we are currently at a basic 
production unit, we will talk with agronomist Justina Reve. What 
do you think, Justina? 
  [Reve] We must understand the situation. Production at our 
farm, meaning our enterprise, must be distributed twice to each 
consumer -- if we may use that expression. In other words, 
although we have to distribute the produce among the population, 
we must also send the produce to daycare centers, schools, and 
hospitals. This scant production must be distributed among all 
consumers. Likewise, we must realize a higher amount of produce 
than was previously available in the market and the [words 
indistinct] stands. Now we can produce only enough tubers and 
rice, of which there is very little, to send to market. Although 
we continue to produce the same amount of tubers, it is not 
enough because we have to supply more consumers. 
  [Maso] Then you agree with what the report indicates -- that 
efforts are being made here in Granma, but that you fail to meet 
the demands? 
  [Reve] Yes, I agree with that, but we must add something: 
The 
people hear that we have sowed many caballerias in Granma, but 
they must realize that not all of these caballerias are 
currently producing. Most of the caballerias were recently sowed 
with plantains, which need between three and four months to 
grow, so production has yet to begin. A small number of 
caballerias are currently producing, so we cannot produce more 
or meet the people's demands.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Teresa Valdez from the "Exclusive" program] </F>
  [Text] We must always consider the conditions for 
committing a crime when deciding whether to bring someone to 
trial. Take the case of a robbery at the enterprise supplying 
sugarcane harvesters that was reviewed by the Fourth Havana 
Provincial Court. The chief custodian testified that he realized 
only on Sunday morning that the storehouse had been robbed of 
merchandise in high demand, including ballpoints, brake fluid, 
battery acid, work boots, and work clothes for the sugarcane 
workers. The defendant testified that he had found the key to 
the storehouse, opened it, entered, and took all he could. The 
custodian who testified said he had trouble seeing what was 
going on because he was at the other station, 200 meters away. 
The stolen material was listed at the trial, and everything was 
recovered. 
  Meanwhile, authorities at the same storehouse have come up 
17,000 pesos short of goods during their inventory. The 
investigating authorities are trying to pinpoint what is missing. 
  It is important to note that while the robbery led to the 
defendant's appearance before the judge even though the stolen 
merchandise was recovered, the shortage involving thousands of 
pesos is merely being investigated. 
  I mention this because today's TRABAJADORES editorial 
insists 
that our country's so-called undergound economy thrives on 
state-owned merchandise and that the stolen merchandise ends up 
on the black market. The two situations violate the law in the 
same way. Yet, which do you consider more important to society, 
if we recall that life is the law and the law is life?

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The total embargo 
along the Dominican border with Haiti will be impossible to 
maintain for much longer, said Dominican Foreign Minister Juan 
Aristides Taveras Guzman. He has added that neither the OAS nor 
the United Nations have made any move to send resources to 
change that. 
  Taveras has affirmed that the possibility of these 
international organizations helping the Dominican Republic to 
defray the cost of keeping 15,000 troops deployed along the 
Haitian border has not been discussed. 
  Dominican authorities hope the Haitian situation will be 
resolved soon because it is almost impossible for the country to 
withstand the cost of the military deployment for much longer. 
The troops have been in the area since 26 May. 
  The foreign minister added that his government has requested 
technical assistance to help supervise what he called the "good 
job" his country is doing to prevent violations of the trade 
embargo, which the international community has imposed on Haiti. 
  He cited the recent OAS General Assembly, saying: "We are 
the 
last ones to want an embargo violation, and we have supported 
all of the resolutions issued to that effect. Furthermore, we 
just made a firm and definitive statement at the recent foreign 
ministers meeting in Brazil asking for everyone to stop 
scrutinizing and criticizing us." 
  Directly addressing the Haitian problem, he said the 
situation has affected the Dominican Republic more that any 
other member of the international community. The Dominicans 
have had to pay a high price for the Haitian problem and, 
therefore, believe the criticism against them should cease. 
  Taveras said his country is still waiting for the list of 
products that will be allowed to cross the Haitian border. 
Dante Caputo, OAS and UN representative, has promised to 
provide the list of items on humanitarian aid. 
  The foreign minister has discarded the possibility of 
military intervention in Haiti "for the time being." Such an 
operation would seek to dislodge the military leaders there and 
restore constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power. 
  Taveras said the international organizations are determined 
to use every possible peaceful, diplomatic, and political means 
to resolve the Haitian crisis. He affirmed that if such a 
military operation were to occur, it would be a multilateral 
effort. 
  The United Nations, the OAS, and several countries have 
criticized the violations that have occurred before 26 May along 
the Haitian border. The embargo became totally effective 24 
hours after a meeting between Dominican President Joaquin 
Balaguer and U.S. and OAS representatives.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Several coinciding 
reports indicate a Dominican soldier shot to death a young 
Haitian man today as several Haitians tried to cross the border 
into the Dominican Republic to purchase supplies. The victim 
was identified as July Jean, 24, who was hit in the temple by a 
bullet. 
  In initial explanations to reporters, Army spokespersons 
have 
said July Jean and several other Haitians tried to attack an 
Army soldier who shot his rifle while trying to defend himself, 
seriously wounding the man. The young man was taken to Mella 
Hospital in Dajabon, where he died. The victim lived in the 
township of Juan Jimenez, near Dajabon. 
  Hundreds of Haitians come to the border everyday in an 
attempt to dodge patrols and enter the Dominican Republic in 
search of food, fuel, and medicine. 
  July Jean is the second Haitian to die within the last 10 
days. The first was an unidentified young man of just under 20 
years of age, also shot by a Dominican Army soldier. 
  The recently intensified embargo against the military regime 
ruling in Port-au-Prince includes fencing off the land and sea 
borders around Haiti. The line dividing Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic, the two Caribbean nations that share the island of La 
Hispaniola, is 300 km long. 
  Santo Domingo reluctantly agreed to deploy Army troops to 
control the region. The request came as a result of pressure 
from Washington, following numerous reports of contraband, 
especially fuel, crossing the border. The flow hampered the 
effects of the blockade to dislodge the Port-au-Prince regime 
and reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The "de facto" 
Haitian Government has demanded that hotel and boarding house 
owners in the country report the identity of the foreigners 
staying in their establishments to the police within a 24-hour 
period. 
  The Interior and Defense Ministry issued a communique on 
this 
which was revealed today. The decision is based on Articles 60 
and 62 dated 26 December 1978, which refer to immigration and 
emigration and compels the owners of hotels and boarding houses 
to report the presence of foreigners in that timespan. The 
communique warns that if this demand is not met, they will 
proceed to arrest the people responsible and suspend the 
licenses and operating permits of the hotels and boarding houses 
that operate in the country. 
  With this measure, the "de facto" government wants to gain 
control over the foreigners who arrive in Haiti in case of a 
possible foreign intervention in this Caribbean country. 
  The Interior and Defense Ministry also calls on the people 
to 
be vigilant and report the presence of unknown people in their 
areas and to be prepared to maintain their civic duty of 
defending the fatherland. Furthermore, it calls on people to 
avoid moving far from their areas of residence to avoid the 
risks of being killed in the face of a possible foreign invasion. 
  On Monday, a short while after the state of emergency was 
declared throughout the entire country, the "de facto" 
government reported that it guaranteed the security of foreign 
citizens in Haiti. In this sense, the Information Ministry has 
requested foreigners to go about their regular business and 
expressed its surprise at U.S. State Department statements 
regarding the security of U.S. citizens in Haiti and said the 
U.S. Government's statements were "precipitous."

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the 
provisional government headed by Haitian President Emile 
Jonassaint (not recognized by the international community) 
"fully guaranteed" that the government will ensure the safety 
and unrestricted movement of foreigners living in Haiti. 
  The Ministry of Information, Coordination, and Culture 
issued 
a communique denying OAS/UN international civilian mission 
(MICIVIH) and U.S. State Department allegations and added that 
the lives of foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, were 
threatened during the presidency of Father Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
  On Friday, Washington decided to recall some of its 
personnel 
from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and has urged U.S. 
citizens to leave the country due to the "unstable political 
situation." 
  The Information Ministry communique recalls "a series of 
incidents during the seven months of Aristide's administration, 
especially the Leogane affair, which resulted in the arrest of 
approximately 10 U.S. citizens and almost ended in their tragic 
death in a lynching inspired by President Aristide's violently 
anti-U.S. speeches." 
  "How and why have they forgotten that anti-imperialism 
fueled 
state terrorism during that period and threatened -- fortunately 
this is a thing of the past -- the lives of U.S. citizens and 
the security of foreign embassy personnel and facilities," the 
text added. 
  The communique also denounced the existence of a "systematic 
disparagement" campaign against Haiti, describing the attitude 
of the OAS/UN civilian mission as "weak" and adding that the 
State Department's behavior "could cause irreparable damage to 
Haiti."

  [Text] The Jonassaint government guarantees all foreigners 
living in Haiti the freedom to attend to their affairs. The 
Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination strongly 
denies the allegations contained in the 8 June communique issued 
by an organization claiming to be an OAS/UN international 
civilian mission in Haiti, which recounts incidents that 
occurred on the evening of 7 June between agents of that 
organization and segments of the Haitian police force. 
  In its concern for the truth, and to shield the country from 
the systematic denigration campaign of which it is an object, 
the Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is 
pleased to present the following corrections: 
  The first and most important correction concerns the arms 
and radios seized by the police patrol on duty that night. The 
arms and radios were not registered with the police or with the 
National Council of Telecommunications [CONATEL], and the two 
operations were led by known police agents working under the the 
strictest military discipline. 
  The Ministry of Information, Culture, and Coordination is 
reacting to the U.S. State Department memo, which responded to 
the report by this alleged OAS/UN international civilian mission 
in Haiti. The Ministry is amazed at the hasty conclusions drawn 
by this U.S. state entity, which asserts that the lives of 
Americans are threatened and their safety remains tentative. 
  Is it necessary to remind them of the series of incidents 
that occurred during the seven-month Aristide government, 
including, among others, the Leogane affair, which cost about 10 
U.S. citizens their freedom and almost brought them to a tragic 
death by lynching; and that these types of events were inspired 
by the anti-American violence of President Aristide's speeches. 
How and why did they forget that anti-imperialism was nourishing 
state-sponsored terrorism at that time -- fortunately in the 
past -- and threatening the lives of Americans and the safety of 
people and buildings of foreign embassies? The Ministry of 
Information, Culture, and Coordination wonders about this. 
  On that score, this Ministry believes this communique by the 
international civilian mission in Haiti is very thoughtless as 
is its corollary, the State Department memo, which can cause 
irreparable damage to Haiti which -- despite low blows and 
ingratitude -- remains on the track of friendship among peoples 
based on mutual respect and human values and freedom. 
  The Ministry of Information takes this opportunity to remind 
all foreigners living on national territory that they have the 
government's full guarantee of their safety and rights and are 
free to attend to their affairs. 
  This note was signed by Jacques Saint-Louis, minister of 
information, culture, and coordination.

  [Text] The Vatican denies having signed an agreement with 
the government of Judge Emile Jonassaint to supply wheat to 
Haiti, contrary to what Port-au-Prince has announced. It is an 
unfounded assertion, stated Vatican spokesman (Joaquin Navarro). 
  It should be recalled that on 13 June, the Information 
Ministry announced the Vatican signed an agreement on 27 May to 
supply 75,000 tons of wheat, worth $32 million, with the 
provisional government of Judge Emile Jonassaint. According to 
the Ministry, this agreement was signed in Italy by the foreign 
minister and by Charles David for the Jonassaint government. 
  The Vatican's spokesman, (Joaquin Navarro), asserted, 
however, that no political representative from Haiti was 
received in the Vatican.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, Jun 14 (AFP) -- This Tuesday, 
Jean-Claude Martineau, spokesman of exiled President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, condemned the 12 June state of emergency 
proclamation by provisional President Emile Jonassaint (the 
international does not recognize him), describing it as a 
"Duvalierist diatribe and a threat veiled in demagoguery." 
  In a communique forwarded to the AFP office in 
Port-au-Prince, Martineau says "the country is, in fact, living 
amid a state of emergency, and all the people's rights have been 
suspended since 30 September 1991" (date of the coup d'etat.) 
"If you want to find those who threaten the country's 
independence, you will not find them abroad because they are in 
our country," he added.

<F P=106> [Report by Herold Jean Francois] </F>
  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Frantz Roberto 
Monde, Haitian Chamber of Deputies president, is prepared to 
support parliament's ratification of the de facto government of 
provisional President Emile Jonassaint if a U.S. invasion takes 
place. 
  The deputy criticized the international community for not 
having accepted the plan to solve the Haitian crisis approved by 
parliament this past 2 March. This plan recommended the 
appointment of a prime minister by constitutional President Jean 
Bertrand Aristide and General Raoul Cedras' resignation from the 
Armed Forces leadership. "Since the international community 
refused the plan and decided in favor of an invasion, we at a 
the local level must adopt measures to ensure the defense of the 
territory," Monde stressed in statements which were broadcast 
last night over the radio. 
  Monde confirmed his willingness to support the Jonassaint de 
facto government if foreign military forces intervene in the 
country. "If an invasion takes place, this government will 
cease to be a government of exception and will become a legal 
government in order to defy the invasion," the deputy stated. 
  In reference to reservations held by the majority of the 
deputies not to recognize the de facto government, Monde pointed 
out that he hopes the parliamentarians "will participate in the 
sessions in order to adopt this decision in case of an 
invasion." He added that "if the majority of the deputies 
decide to abstain from participating and expressing their 
opposition to an occupation, I believe the last measure to be 
adopted then should be to dissolve parliament." 
  Monde, as president of the Chamber of Deputies has not yet 
adopted an official position in favor of installing the de facto 
government. Monde, however, has been closely linked to all the 
government decisions proposed by the military and has appeared 
in all official ceremonies beside Jonassaint. 
  On the other hand, the "Crisis Group," created following the 
implementation of the state of emergency on Sunday and composed 
by the ministers of economy, foreign affairs, interior, defense, 
and information, met for the first time yesterday. 
  In addition, during an irregular Senate session, a group of 
senators in favor of the de facto government revived the memory 
of the military removed by the United States in 1915 and 1916 
during Haiti's occupation. In their resolution, these senators, 
most of whom were elected during the fraudulent 18 January 1993 
elections, abolished the expulsion order decreed by the U.S. 
Navy against the Haitian military and reinstated them to the 
Army with their respective ranks. 
  In explaining the resolution, described as bizarre and 
demagogic by political observers in the Haitian capital city, 
Senator Ehrane Cadet, member of the Alliance for Parliamentary 
Cohesion that supported the Aristide overthrow, stated that its 
objective is to encourage Haitians to defend the nation.

  [Text] On 13 June, the branch of the Senate of the Republic 
led by Senator Bernard Sansaricq restored officers and soldiers 
of the Haitian Army who had been dismissed by the foreign 
occupation forces during the years 1915 and 1916. In a 
resolution adopted on 13 June, the assembly of the contested 18 
January senators declared that the military dismissed in the 
years 1915 to 1916 would enjoy the same rights, prerogatives, 
and privileges granted to the retired members of the Haitian 
Armed Forces. This decision, which had mere symbolic value, is 
aimed at encouraging Haitians to sacrifice themselves for the 
glory and greatness of the homeland. Here is an excerpt of the 
resolution presented by Sen. Cadet: 
  [Begin Cadet recording] Considering that it is necessary to 
encourage and stimulate Haitians to sacrifice themselves for the 
honor and glory of the homeland; considering that it is 
necessary to restore the memory of the members of the Haitian 
Army dismissed during the years 1915 and 1916 by the foreign 
occupation forces, and to correct such a grave injustice, the 
Senate of the Republic has decided on the following: 
  Article 1. The dissolution of the Haitian Army, Navy, and 
police force by foreign occupation forces during the years 1915 
and 1916 is null and void. 
  Article 2. The members of the Army, Navy, and the Haitian 
police force, dismissed during the years 1915 and 1916, are 
restored with their respective ranks to the Haitian Armed 
Forces. [end recording] 
  That was an excerpt from the resolution voted on 13 June by 
the branch of the Senate led by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq.

  [Text] Evans Francois, brother of the Port-au-Prince police 
chief, has asked General Cedras to resign to avoid a military 
intervention against Haiti. The brother of Lieutenant Colonel 
Michel Francois addressed a letter to that effect to the Army 
chief. Let us listen to Evans Francois: 
  [Begin Francois recording] At this watershed where my 
country's sovereignty is threatened by the most powerful nation 
in the world, General, the threats of military intervention are 
serious. This is not the time to be shilly-shallying. The 
courageous Evans, one of the authors of the 30 September coup 
d'etat, could have continued to give you his support. He was 
convinced you would have changed in a positive direction one 
day. If tomorrow, I were sure to find even a minimum of 
seriousness in your behavior... [pauses] What I am sure of, Mr. 
General, is that the 34 months of crisis have never been managed 
in the interest of the nation. There was not one government that 
came from the 30 September coup which, once installed, was not 
handicapped by your shrewd behavior, which always made you 
appear in the eyes of the world as a moderate, until appointment 
of the Jonassaint government, the disguised triumvirate. [end

  [Text] St. Lucia, like all the other countries in the 
region, continues to fight off the drug menace. As is 
customary, large quantities of drugs confiscated are set to the 
torch, hoping that this and the fines and imprisonment terms can 
act as a deterrent for both perpetrators and would-be felons. 
Last month, members of the Royal St. Lucia Police Force, 
accompanied by prison inmates, took a large quantity of 
confiscated drugs to the dump site and set it alight. The 
stash, comprising marijuana, cocaine, and crack, was estimated 
at over ECU250,000.

<F P=106> [Message to the Mexican people from the Institutional </F>
Revolutionary Party (PRI) National Executive Committee: "The PRI 
on Chiapas"] 
  [Text] The National Executive Committee [CEN] of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], aware of the changes 
observed in the conflict unleashed by the EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army] in the mountains of Chiapas, and in 
accordance with the demands made yesterday by our candidate for 
president of the republic, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, states 
the following: 
  1. We hereby express our concern over the EZLN communique 
which rejects the peace agreement proposed by the commissioner 
for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas on behalf of the 
government and which brings the dialogue to an end, even though 
the Mexican people have at all times supported the civilized 
position adopted by the government. 
  2. The PRI and all citizens of good faith urge the immediate 
resumption of negotiations and support for the Chiapas 
government in every way possible as the conflict enters a new 
phase. 
  3. We reiterate that a political solution is the only option 
that remains in keeping with our convictions, and that dialogue 
and concerted efforts are essential within the de jure state 
because, thanks to the efforts of generations, Mexico is a 
country of institutions and laws. 
  4. We agree with the government of the republic's statement, 
made yesterday, with regard to maintaining the cease-fire 
decreed on 12 January as a prior step toward total and equitable 
peace because a truce alone will not satisfy the hopes of the 
Mexican people, nor will it fulfill their desire for harmony. 
  5. We confirm our democratic conviction, proven by our 
decisive participation in the Agreement for Peace, Democracy, 
and Justice on 27 January 1994, which led to amendments of the 
general Constitution of the republic, the Federal Code of 
Institutions and Electoral Procedures, and penal laws by totally 
impartial electoral authorities and which allowed the Federal 
Electoral Institute to adopt measures to guarantee that the 21 
August elections will be credible, honest, efficient, 
legitimate, and fully in keeping with the law. 
  The PRI is unconditionally committed to perfecting the 
country's democratic life and confirms that violence is 
unacceptable because it is only through institutions that 
Mexico's problems can be resolved. 
  6. We agree that democracy can be achieved only if it is 
based on self-sustained and balanced development, national 
sovereignty, and social justice, and that it is time to deal 
more efficiently with social backwardness, regional injustices, 
and the unfortunate conditions experienced by many Indians. 
  7. We do not agree that hope for peace fostered in Mexico 
over the past few months has been thwarted. 
  8. We hereby confirm that the time has come for political 
tolerance; therefore, on Thursday 9 June, our candidate sent a 
personal message to the eight presidential candidates inviting 
them and the country's social organizations to a direct dialogue 
with a view to agreements that will support a national unity 
agreement for democracy, justice, development, and peace. 
  9. We would like to know why the federal government's 
goodwill, the protracted negotiations, the months that have gone 
by, the government's flexibility, and its genuine recognition of 
the unfair social realities that infuriate us all have proven 
insufficient. 
  10. We request that, in accordance with President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's instructions, given yesterday, government 
offices and institutions vigorously and generously implement 
legal and institutional changes and a program that will increase 
the wellbeing of people in Chiapas, especially in the 
mountainous areas, and bring justice and spiritual peace to 
their homes.

Secretary 
General Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu

<F P=106> [Interview with Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Mexican </F>
Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, by reporters Jose 
Cardenas and Katia Valentina Buenol; place and date not given; 
from the "Panorama Newscast" -- live or recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Cardenas] Dr. Zedillo, you 
mentioned that there are 40 million Mexicans and that 17 million 
of them live in poverty.... 
  [Zedillo, interrupting] That is 14 million and an 
undetermined amount of other Mexicans, I do not think I would 
reach the 40 million figure, but there are many. Even if the 
figure were one, it would be too many. 
  [Cardenas] In your economic proposal, however, which you 
presented on Monday to prominent members of your party and 
businessmen, you talked about a new economic position for 
sustained growth. But there is no talk of fighting poverty in 
specific terms. Have you planned to discuss this matter soon? 
  [Zedillo] It is correct. 
  [Cardenas] Or is it an omission? 
  [Zedillo] Absolutely not. In the initial part of my speech, 
I said I was concentrating on purely economic matters; however, 
I did say that the country needs a very specific and 
well-designed strategy to fight poverty. In a few days, I 
stressed, I will give a speech on social development. In this 
speech, I will give details on my strategy to fight poverty in 
our country. I am working on that speech, and I estimate that I 
will give it in a few days. It is written in this document, and 
thus, there is no room for doubt; there is no omission. I said 
one of the country's most severe problems is poverty and that 
this problem calls for a specific strategy, like the one I will 
present in a few days. 
  [Cardenas] Dr. Zedillo, many listeners have been calling 
since 0600. We announced in advance -- as we did with the other 
candidates -- that you were to be our guest today. The people 
sent us some questions which I am sure will be of interest to 
you. Perhaps some of them will be answered; unfortunately, there 
were many calls. But we hope to air as many as possible. 
  [Buenol] We put them into groups because some of them are 
repetitious, and it will be easier to handle them this way. Dr. 
Jose Cultierro mentioned how badly paid doctors are in Mexico. 
Speaking of the economic proposal, Ruben Aguilar, Casimiro 
Barajas of Puebla, Miguel Angel Lucero of Puebla, Gilberto Tapia 
Salgado of Acapulto, Maria Refugio Hernandez of Mexico City, 
Rafael Mazon of Mexico City, and Mrs. Garcia of the Irrigacion 
neighborhood coincided in asking: Why should we believe in this 
economic plan when you designed the current one and it did not 
work? 
  [Zedillo] I think that one must check to see whether it 
worked or not in the light of the magnitude of the problems 
Mexico had. Let us not forget that our country inherited a big 
economic crisis from the 1970's. In the early 1980's things 
became further complicated. Six years ago, our inflation rate 
was 200 percent, the economy was not growing, but collapsing. 
Our economic structure was obsolete, and, in the face of this 
problem, we had to reorganize, improve, and build new bases for 
the economy. Based on these new bases, we have to begin the 
stage of economic growth that we are proposing now. It would 
have been impossible, simply put, like an act of magic, to have 
been able to overcome, overnight, the problems we inherited for 
several decades. These were very serious problems, and it would 
have been impossible to switch to an economy with growth and 
jobs and no inflation. That simply does not exist in the realm 
of the possible. We had to reorganize the economy and the 
country. We have done it, and now we have to take advantage of 
the fruit of that effort through a congruent strategy. I think 
the value of this strategy must be taken into consideration 
because of its internal coherence. I insist that there are 
evident achievements, but there are also problems that persist. 
The achievements are obvious to everyone. 
  Six years ago, the government's total debt was 70 percent of 
the country's production. Now, it is less than one fourth. Six 
years ago, the inflation rate was 200 percent, and now we have a 
one-digit inflation rate. Six years ago, we were experiencing a 
terrible financial crisis that scared away capital from our 
country and prevented us from growing. Six years ago, 
unemployment was destroying the country. Now, we are creating 
jobs, and, although in a very insufficient way, we do have the 
opportunity to make employment grow. It is a different world, 
but we are not happy with it. We have to work more to attain 
more. 
  [Cardenas] Mr. Zedillo, you are a doctor of economics from 
one of the most prestigious foreign universities: Yale. You 
have a degree in economics from the National Polytechnic 
Institute. You are a man whose abilities in economics is beyond 
any doubt and your work is well recognized. Your devotion as an 
economist is unquestionable. You have proven this through your 
professional career. You are 43 years old. No, you are still 
42, you will be 43 in December, that is correct. Undoubtedly, 
you are an economist; it is your devotion, but are you devoted 
to being a politician? 
  [Zedillo] I believe my many years of work with the 
government can attest to the fact that my devotion is public 
service. I do not like to describe myself as a technician, a 
politician, this or that. But I can assure you that ever since 
I was a child, I had this devotion to public service. I wanted 
to serve my country. I have done that from positions that 
sometimes were purely technical and financial. Sometimes, I 
have had to do that from almost purely political positions, such 
as being education secretary, which meant heading the largest 
secretariat in the Mexican Government. I was in the midst of 
political problems that were very complex. I headed an activity 
that involved the federalization of education. It meant 
negotiating with Latin America's largest and most powerful union 
and the country's governors. I had to handle the federal 
government's relations with Mexican universities. I had to deal 
with many political problems, perhaps more than any other state 
secretary had to deal with. I would say that all that proves 
that I am very much attracted to public service. 
  [Cardenas] What is the biggest problem that the Salinas de 
Gortari administration will bequeath to the next president, 
which could be you. 
  [Zedillo] I do not think it is a problem of inheritance from 
one six-year term to the other. These are problems that exist 
in the country. The problems that seem more burdensome at a 
given time are those that get solved first. Six years ago, the 
most burdensome problem was the macroeconomy. It prevented the 
government from tackling any other problem. If the macroeconomy 
problem was not solved, we could not advance in the solution of 
other problems. 
  In today's outlook, I have pointed out that Mexico's most 
important problems are: first, insecurity and injustice 
afflicting most Mexicans. It is a very grave problem. This is 
why I am talking about a thorough reform of our justice system. 
A reform that will include the laws, the Attorney General's 
Office, and the judicial branch. Another problem is that of 
unemployment. It is very grave. I have seen it. I have 
witnessed it throughout the country. There is the problem of 
the lack of income. This is what a doctor mentioned a few 
minutes ago. Salaries are insufficient. This is why we need the 
economy and productivity to grow. We need to make the economic 
pie bigger so we can all get a bigger piece and thus alleviate 
our situation. 
  The other basic problem is poverty. Poverty is enraging 
because of its grave nature. These are the challenges of the 
coming year: justice, growth, and poverty. [passage omitted] 
  [Cardenas] You mentioned a commitment that draws everyone's 
attention: the creation of 1 million jobs. You made that 
announcement at the National Auditorium on Monday. You talked 
about productive jobs, 1 million jobs each year. How have you 
planned this? How do you think this can be achieved with a 
recession? How can you create 1 million jobs? This is very 
costly. How can this be done without affecting the process to 
control inflation? There is a contraction in foreign 
investment. There are increasing pressures with regard to the 
type of exchange of the peso vis-a-vis the dollar. There is 
also commercial opening, globalization, NAFTA, the pressure on 
micro, small, and medium industries. How can you, with all this 
in mind, create 1 million jobs each year? 
  [Zedillo] The answer was within the question. The economy is 
practically at a standstill nowadays. Thus, we must not be 
surprised that there are no more jobs. Simply, the economy is 
not absorbing more people to work, and, therefore, there is no 
possibility of improving the situation. 
  What I am proposing is a strategy to achieve economic 
growth. 
Only with economic growth can we have more jobs. How will we 
attain economic growth? Spurring investment. What does it mean 
to spur investment? It means the opening of more businesses, 
more sources of employment in our country or expanding growing 
firms. The program that I explained to the citizens last week 
is aimed at reactivating the economy. Its goal is to have 
sustained growth. What for? To have the 1 million jobs you just 
mentioned. It is a program that does not contradict what has 
been done. Supposedly, we will be consolidating the economy's 
structural changes. It means that we will not lower our guard 
with regard to inflation. It means that, based on what we have 
done so far, we must go from a stage where emphasis was placed 
on stabilization and macroeconomy to a stage where economic 
growth must be the main concern in economic policy. The key 
task is the creation of jobs. If six years ago our need was to 
control inflation, now the emphasis must be placed on the 
creation and multiplication of jobs. This is the reason for the 
ten specific points that I announced to all. [passage omitted] 
  [Buenol] Dr. Zedillo, one of the serious problems in our 
country is excessive centralism. Mr. Francisco Torres of 
Saltillo, Coahuila, wants to ask you how you are going to 
conduct an effective decentralization that can contribute to the 
economic reactivation of the various states if you reach the 
presidency. 
  [Zedillo] We must do it by carefully reviewing our country's 
entire federal system. There is a huge concentration of 
responsibilities, resources, and authority in the federal 
government. This brings about inefficiency; it limits the 
capacity of the federal government itself, and it keeps the 
authorities removed from the citizens. I am proposing an 
effective decentralization of the country. I am not only 
speaking of [word indistinct]. I had the responsibility at the 
Public Education Secretariat to head the biggest 
decentralization process of our country and perhaps of all 
countries in the world. As public education secretary, I turned 
over three-fourths of the secretariat to the state governments; 
I turned over 100,000 schools, 700,000 employees, including 
teachers and support personnel. I turned over a large portion of 
the educational budget and 13.5 million students. If we did it 
in the education sector, we can do it in other fields too. We 
have to give them the authority and the resources because we 
believe that the government that is closest to the citizens has 
the greatest capacity to respond to the citizens. 
  [Cardenas] The Teachers' Union complained about the 
decentralization process because the union lost the control it 
used to have. We have even talked about it with the union 
leader. If there is criticism to be made about your 
administration as education secretary, it is precisely that one. 
You obviously.... 
  [Zedillo, interrupting] If you allow me, that is not the 
case. Decentralization was done based on a national agreement, 
which was signed by the Teachers' Union itself. The union 
played a very special and positive role, I would say the leading 
role, in drafting the agreement. Without their participation, 
it would not have been possible for us to carry out the 
decentralization of the education sector. The Teachers' Union 
has been demanding the fulfillment of each and every single one 
of the points of the national agreement, and they are right. 
They accepted federalization, and they are part of 
federalization. None of their union rights were adversely 
affected; the union's national status was not adversely 
affected. I would have never accepted to participate in a 
government action in which labor unions were adversely affected. 
I am a man with labor union convictions. What the labor union 
has been demanding is the fulfillment of the specific points of 
the agreement. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jun (NA) -- Today, Interior 
Minister Carlos Ruckauf linked the alleged Shining Path [SL] 
member who was arrested in Tucuman with the social outbursts 
that occurred recently in the interior of the country, 
indicating that those who escaped when the Peruvian was captured 
"have been identified and arrest warrants have been issued." 
  Ruckauf confirmed that the alleged member of the Peruvian 
Maoist SL organization is under arrest. He has been identified 
as Jorge Diaz Reategui. The minister added that those who were 
with him at the time of his arrest "have been seen wherever 
social outbursts have occurred." 
  Reategui's arrest took place at a hotel in the poor district 
of El Bajo, near the Tucuman city bus terminal. At the time, he 
was meeting with other alleged guerrillas, who managed to escape. 
  The interior minister indicated that those who were with 
Reategui "have been seen in other parts of the country, 
participating in public outbursts." He emphasized: "They have 
been identified and arrest warrants have been issued." 
  Reategui was questioned during the afternoon of 10 June by 
Judge Ricardo Maturana, who heads Federal Court No. 2 of the 
city of Tucuman. Details of the questioning were not revealed. 
  Police sources have confirmed that special security measures 
have been implemented regarding Reategui to prevent any rescue 
or escape attempt by his comrades in arms. 
  Authorities are concerned because Tucuman Province, where 
the 
terrorist was arrested, has been identified as a refugee camp 
for SL members who clandestinely cross the border. 
  The Maoist guerrillas, infamous for their violent actions, 
presumably install themselves in Tucuman Province to train 
Peruvian and Argentine militants who support their ideology.

<F P=106> [Interview with Conscience of the Fatherland Senator Andres </F>
Soliz Rada; place and date not given] 
  [Text] In the face of the gloomy prospects that await the 
labor sector, Andres Soliz Rada, journalist, political analyst, 
senator, and secretary of doctrine and training for Conscience 
of the Fatherland (CONDEPA), predicts that the Capitalization 
Law "will be at loggerheads" with the Popular Participation Law 
because the former brings the country back to the days of the 
"tin barons" while the latter is "unquestionably revolutionary." 
One eliminates sovereignty and the other "allows the people to 
set their own course." 
  [PRESENCIA] How do you see the future of the Bolivian labor 
movement? 
  [Soliz] Organized labor is in crisis all over the world. The 
globalization of the economy, the implementation of neoliberal 
policies, the freedom to hire, robots, automation, and 
scientific and technological advances have resulted in the loss 
of tens of millions of productive jobs, even in highly 
industrialized countries. These factors have also led to 
hypertrophic growth in the services sector and the informal 
economy. 
  The result of the current social equation is disturbing: 
"The 
more modernity, the less employment." All indications are that 
wage earners in our time belong to the last generation of 
workers who have benefited from job security, social security, 
compensation, and paid vacations. Neoliberalism has no heart. 
Either you accept the employer's conditions or you have no job. 
There are countless legions of unemployed workers, including 
professionals, who are waiting to fill what few job openings 
there are. This cataclysm has had perverse effects on the 
Bolivian labor movement, especially since Decree 21060 of 29 
August 1985, which shifted the axis of the national economy from 
hydrocarbons, mining, and the still weak nontraditional exports 
to the various aspects of drug trafficking. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does drug trafficking have to do with 
Decree 
21060? 
  [Soliz] Although that criminal activity has obvious roots in 
the Banzer and Garcia Meza dictatorships, 21060 promoted the 
acceptance of bank deposits "without tracing their origin." The 
brains behind the operation, Jeffery Sachs, has "narcotized" the 
Bolivian economy, with all the imaginable consequences, ranging 
from the movement of former miners to the Chapare, to the 
infiltration of cocaine proceeds into political structures. That 
was the origin of scandals such as those of Huanchaca (involving 
the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement), the narcovideos 
(involving Nationalist Democratic Action), and the narcophotos 
(involving the Movement of the Revolutionary Left). The ensuing 
commotion obviously shook the foundations of the Bolivian Labor 
Federation (COB). Only now have its leaders begun to realize 
that their survival depends on their ability to bring together 
emerging sectors, such as trade associations, informal workers, 
hometowns, drivers, and craftsmen, without neglecting the 
interests of workers who still depend on a regular paycheck. 
  In short, the future of the COB depends on its ability to 
expand its sphere of influence, on the one hand, and to raise 
the banner of national defense, on the other hand, so that the 
"Tupacamarization" of Bolivia can be contained. 
  [PRESENCIA] What are you referring to? 
  [Soliz] To the sinister capitalization law governing former 
state enterprises that have now been turned into mixed 
corporations. It will allow such entities as Bolivian Government 
Oil Deposits (YPFB), the National Smelting Enterprise (Enaf), 
the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), and the 
National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) to be captured and 
"vampirized" by foreign capital. In the name of modernity, 
Bolivia is returning to the days of Patino, Hoschild, and 
Aramayo, who sucked the wealth out of the country and put it in 
foreign banks. The neoliberal doctrine is supposed to solve the 
problems of the third millennium with postulates from the 18th 
and 19th centuries: those of Adam Smith and Robert Malthus. 
  YPFB, the Mining Corporation of Bolivia (COMIBOL), Entel, 
Enfe, Enaf, and Ende will be administered by transnationals. Our 
weak symphony orchestra will be transformed into a musical group 
in which each member will beat the drum at his own rhythm. 
Entel's foreign board of directors will decide whether it is 
worthwhile to install electricity facilities in Provinces of La 
Paz, Pando, Tarija, or Santa Cruz. Its decision will depend on a 
calculation of immediate profits, not on national interest. If 
the parameters of the World Bank or the Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) had been followed, Bolivia would not have 
built its Cochabamba-Santa Cruz highway. YPFB's foreign board of 
directors may decide to sell our gas to Brazil through Argentine 
pipelines, or to sell it to Chile over the objections of the 
Foreign Ministry. 
  In short, the self-determination that we won with the 
revolution of April 1952 will have been forfeited for the 
benefit of the new foreign "barons" of the former state 
enterprises. 
  [PRESENCIA] What implications does the Popular Participation 
Law have for the labor movement? 
  [Soliz] It is a chink in the system's armor that the popular 
movement should take advantage of. From a conceptual point of 
view, this law has an unquestionably revolutionary content. By 
recognizing the legal status of ayllus [tribes], 
tentas, captaincies, cabildos [town 
councils], and farmworkers' unions, it has taken a tremendous 
step toward eliminating one of the greatest injustices 
perpetrated over the five centuries of external and internal 
colonialism. This legal instrument is, at the same time, the 
antithesis of the Capitalization Law. The former tends to allow 
the people, joined together in municipal jurisdictions and 
neighborhood boards, to set their own course and their own 
priorities; the latter eliminates sovereignty and allows the 
exploitation of natural resources to benefit foreign interests, 
as has been occurring for the last 500 years. The former seeks 
to encourage citizens to plan for their future; the latter 
allows huge hypodermic needles to suck the lifeblood out of the 
country, with no benefit for Bolivians, as has occurred with 
silver, quinine, rubber, tin, and petroleum. The interests 
created by the two laws will be at loggerheads with each other 
over the next few years. The Capitalization Law is part of the 
New World Order that seeks to destroy the countries of the Third 
World. The Popular Participation Law can be an instrument for 
defending the fatherland, limiting efforts to shrink even 
further our sparse population, repopulating the provinces, and 
eliminating corruption. Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas, to 
the extent that he does not become more of a tool of the 
neoliberals, and Deputy Remedios Loza are the symbols of Popular 
Participation. Fernando Illanes and other plutocrats are the 
paradigms of the Capitalization Law. In that context, the COB 
must stand firm for the Popular Participation Law, fight to 
eliminate its negative aspects, and extend its scope so that it 
can serve as a point of departure for the COB and other 
political organizations in the popular sphere, such as CONDEPA, 
to move forward in the construction of the Productive 
Revolution, the Moral Revolution, and Participative Democracy. 
  [PRESENCIA] How do you explain these concepts? 
  [Soliz] Bolivia cannot allow its future to depend on food 
donations or on the precarious profits of drug trafficking; it 
must achieve self-sufficiency in food. This was achieved in 
Tiwanacu, in the Inca Empire, and in the Jesuit missions. It was 
also part of the Bohan Plan, proposed by the United States to 
Bolivia in 1942, during World War II, for the purpose of 
assuring food supplies. 
  If we Bolivians do not carry out our own moral revolution, 
this postulate will become a pretext for foreign intervention 
and domination. The superstate installed by the DEA [Drug 
Enforcement Administration] needs no further comment. I would 
like to note, however, that along the lines of our moral 
revolution, I have submitted two bills that the parliamentary 
oligarchy refuses to discuss: The Fortune Investigation Law and 
the Law Against Impunity. The latter advocates the elimination 
of the statute of limitations on crimes against the state. Under 
the SAFCO [Administrative and Financial System for Government 
Control] Law, the statute of limitations is now 10 years. Given 
the current legal framework, the deals made as a result of the 
Capitalization Law will soon be immune from any scrutiny. The 
Popular Participation Law was proposed by CONDEPA, as stated in 
"The Book of the Endogenous Model," which we published last 
year. In that publication we also planned the conversion of the 
current inefficient, verbose, 18th-century parliament into an 
assembly of producers made up of all the economic and cultural 
sectors in the country. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does the current social protest stand for? 
  [Soliz] The people organized and turned into a vanguard by 
the COB have responded to attempts to demobilize them by staging 
hunger strikes, for the purpose of reducing hunger. People have 
risked their lives; they have faced death and repression to 
reduce the "terrible dependency" recognized by the president of 
the Republic himself. The active involvement of Aymaras, 
Quechuas, Guaranis, Amazon ethnic groups, and Mestizos in 
national affairs is the only possibility we have to avoid 
swelling the ranks of the slaves of the 21st century. That is 
why we are passionately in love with interculturalness and its 
incipient possibilities. This diversity is not an obstacle, but 
a creative component in a Latin America that has been united 
defensively so that it will not be excluded from the unknown 
world that is approaching.

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tortures Being Modernized Along With </F>
Democracy"] 
  [Text] In Bolivia there are 21 types of torture and three 
phases of altered behavior. The same roster of torture personnel 
serves dictators and democrats. Extraction of confessions is 
aimed at incriminating journalists and politicians. 
  According to the Political Constitution of the State, the 
democratic system protects the physical and psychic integrity of 
persons. According to reports in the hands of the Chamber of 
Deputies Committee on Human Rights, neither democracy nor the 
various other types of government can prevent the existence of a 
quasi-autonomous organization dedicated to the corporal and 
moral annihilation of those who fall into their hands charged 
with terrorism or subversion of public order. 
  But according to Deputy Ramiro Barrenechea, a member of the 
Human Rights Committee, the aforementioned organization shows a 
propensity for "modernizing" through more sophisticated methods, 
with participation in them ranging from physicians who determine 
the extent to which the detainee is likely to withstand the 
tortures, to psychologists who separate the false information 
from the truth after hours of uninterrupted interrogation on a 
single point. 
  There may be more, but, in the investigation being conducted 
by the committee, Barrenechea states that it has detected the 
existence of 21 types of torture and three phases of altered 
behavior of the persons, aimed at extracting handwritten 
self-incriminating statements, or statements that involve other 
persons in specified acts. 
  "The tortures identified by the committee include beatings, 
electric prods, the `submarine,' `bell,' and `pig' treatments, 
special blows to the genitals, and raping of men and women," he 
said. He added that violence of the sexual type is the most 
frequently used. 
<H5>  Until Turned Into Limp Flesh </H5>
  Based on data provided by testimonies, Barrenechea explained 
that the techniques designed to extract confessions involve 
three evaluation phases. The first, aimed at 
uncommunicativeness, consists of unlimited physical violence and 
threats of violence against members of the victim's family, and 
it is conducted by Bolivian torturers. 
  In the second phase, the system of tortures is refined and 
is 
conducted with greater discernment and sophistication, because 
it is done by foreign experts. In the third phase, the intensity 
of the tortures is diminished, but techniques are applied that 
are designed to break routines and create situations of mental 
derangement. 
  One of the torturers assumes a paternal role, pretends 
identification with the victim's problem, and persuades the 
victim to sign anything. During the persuasion interval, other 
methods are also used, such as preventing sleep for 17 days, or 
keeping the victim seated and tied to a chair for five 
consecutive days, without permitting movement even for tending 
to physiological needs, all the while pressing the victim with 
repeated questions. 
  "Those acting the role of psychologists take part in this 
phase, asking the same question or others some 50 to 500 times 
to detect associations and verify whether what is being said by 
the victim, converted now into a lump of limp flesh, is the 
truth or a lie," said Barrenechea, adding: "Pressure is also 
applied scientifically, and we are trying to determine who are 
the doctors responsible for prescribing the dosages of torture 
and pressures the victim is able to take." 
  Barrenechea stated that after such treatment, the victim's 
sole desire is to die and get it all over with rather than 
continue living in constant dread, and that this state is used 
to get the victim to sign a confession and incriminate other 
persons. 
  "We have found a constant in all of these interrogations: 
The 
victim is handed a list of names of persons that includes those 
of many journalists and politicians," he said, adding that the 
victims sign what they are told to sign, and even incriminate 
themselves, in order to end the tortures, despite the fact that 
Bolivian law does not accept such documents as valid. 
  "The committee is now also investigating why the judges are 
not accepting the evidence being presented by detainees 
attesting to their having been compelled to incriminate 
themselves and others by torture," he said. 
<H5>  A Power That Vies With That of Government and State </H5>
  Barrenechea stated that the personnel conducting the 
tortures 
are "professionals," and that they have not been removed since 
the era of dictatorships, and even previous to that, because 
they "include persons from the first MNR [Nationalist 
Revolutionary Movement] period of rule. These are persons who 
have worked with the MNR's system of political control, the 
dictatorships of Banzer and Garcia Meza, the Patriotic Agreement 
government, and the present government. They are apparently 
irremovable persons with international specialization," he said. 
  The existence of that apparatus specializing in repression, 
said Barrenechea, is constant, regardless of political regimes, 
and has become a quasi-autonomous structure beyond the control 
of even the executive branch of the government. 
  "This is why the committee is working to reconcile the state 
with civil society, and to prevent the committing of these 
utterly savage acts in the name of the law," he said. 
<H5>  Terrorist Unions </H5>
  The entire description mentioned above is drawn from the 
testimony heard by the Committee on Human Rights from 36 persons 
who were detained for acts of terrorism. They are members of 
subversive groups such as Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army [EGTK], 
"Zarate Willka," the Nestor Paz Zamora Command [CNPZ], and the 
Army of National Liberation [ELN], who appeared before the 
committee last week in compliance with a summons issued by the 
Chamber of Deputies. 
  "This is part of an investigation of 50 persons charged with 
acts of terrorism, 10 of whom are in Chonchocoro, 11 in San 
Pedro, five in Posta, five in the Women's Correction Center, and 
four in prison in Cochabamba. Ten other persons are fugitives at 
large, one is a `missing person,' and four were released after 
being detained." 
  Upon completing its evaluation, which will address elements 
of what is stated in the above paragraphs, the committee will 
issue a report, summon torturers, and police and judicial 
officials who permitted the violation of human and 
constitutional rights, and inspect the houses of detention.

<F P=106> [Interview with Chief of Police General Luis Rocha Martinez: </F>
"Bolivian Police Wants To Project New Image"; in La Paz, date 
not given] 
  [Text] La Paz 2 (LOS TIEMPOS) -- As he condemned views 
critical of the Ministry of Interior and General Staff of the 
Bolivian Police, expressed by several "self-styled 
institutionalist police chiefs," General Luis Rocha Martinez 
stated in an interview granted to LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz, that 
the institution has begun carrying out "irreversible actions" 
aimed at projecting a new image to the country's population. 
  Expressing "profound concern that illegal interests have 
embedded themselves in the institution, with obscure aims," 
General Rocha spoke of several modernization projects that are 
under way in La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and other districts 
of the country, and "that can be expected to come to fruition 
soon." 
  The police chief referred to the "plans, programs, and 
strategies" that have been drawn up by his staff in the short 
time he has been in command, designed to modernize the Bolivian 
police. Following is the dialogue held with General Rocha 
Martinez: 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] General Luis Rocha, the modernization plans 
announced by the police have been so severely criticized that it 
is now said that these good intentions have been postponed 
indefinitely. Is there any truth to what is being said? 
  [Rocha] No. Very much on the contrary, my staff has taken 
definite steps in recent months toward improving the police 
institution's infrastructure, academic training, and modernizing 
the institution's equipment. 
  The Bolivian police's current change of attitude exists and 
is permanent. The steps it has taken in its pursuit of renewal 
within the institution include the creating of an Honor Tribunal 
made up of former commanding generals of the police; the 
purchase of equipment to provide improved security services to 
the public; and the drawing up of plans to improve qualitatively 
the carrying out of their assigned tasks by the institution's 
future officers. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] Just what are the improvements to which you 
refer? 
  [Rocha] For example, we have accelerated the work on 
remodeling the police units in the city of La Paz and 
Cochabamba. Evidence of this is the very recent remittance of 
approximately 40,000 bolivianos to the city of Cochabamba's 
Departmental Command, enabling it to proceed with the remodeling 
of what were once the criminology offices and are soon to be the 
sections of the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ]. 
  The little that is available to the institution to improve 
its means of providing service to the Bolivian population is 
being put to use. As part of these plans, legally established 
businesses in Bolivia have been invited to bid on supplying 
typewriters and new office equipment for the offices of the PTJ. 
During the first phase, these PTJ offices will operate in La 
Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz. 
  With respect to its improvements program, the institution is 
currently awaiting the release of the Bolivian police budget 
funds that were approved this year by the government, so as to 
issue further calls for bids on the supplying of police 
reconnaissance cars, modern vehicles to augment our pool of 
radio patrol cars, and motorcycles for use by the Citizens 
Assistance and Cooperation Patrol [PAC] in La Paz, Cochabamba, 
and Santa Cruz. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] Will the PAC operate only in La Paz, 
Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz? 
  [Rocha] No. The plan will be implemented throughout Bolivia. 
Specific phases of the program are being drawn up for this 
purpose. In this respect, we are planning an initial purchase of 
120 motorcycles for the three departments of the country. 
  Upon completion of these projects along the central axis, 
the 
program will be extended to Oruro, Sucre, and Potosi, and in a 
third phase to the departments of Tarija, Beni, and Pando. 
  [LOS TIEMPOS] To what other areas has your staff assigned a 
modernization priority? 
  [Rocha] My staff has also accorded attention to the police 
training system. Over the past few weeks we have entered a new 
period of extended police training. 
  Under this program, substantial transformations are under 
way, beginning with the National Police Academy in La Paz, the 
Officers Post-Graduate Institute, the Noncommissioned Officers 
Training School, and the Basic Training Schools. 
  After many years, competitive examinations have been opened 
to women. Women are a very real necessity especially in police 
units connected with the PTJ [Judicial Technical Police], and 
the narcotics and other services that are part of the 
institution. This year, we are going to begin by increasing the 
female police component by 50 persons. The component will 
operate in parallel with the Police Basic Training School. 
  Thus, and as borne out by these general examples I have 
cited, the process of modernization and institutional change 
within the Bolivian police is well under way. 
  The institution fully intends to improve its image 
qualitatively in the minds of the citizens. It is to this end 
that we are implementing a program of reequipping the police 
with new reconnaissance cars, radio patrol cars, and ambulances 
to provide emergency assistance to the citizens. 
  Concurrently, we are redistributing our institution's best 
police personnel -- personnel who have been fully trained, 
including training in Europe as well -- to more effectively 
perform our task of serving the Bolivian people.

  [Text] Porto Alegre, 11 Jun (AE) -- PT [Workers Party] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has admitted 
that he might wear a bulletproof vest while in public. Lula 
confirmed this possibility on Saturday afternoon in Esteio, a 
town in Greater Porto Alegre, where he attended a barbecue with 
PT followers and candidates. 
  Lula will wear the vest only "under special circumstances," 
and depending on the place. He made it clear that he would like 
wearing that kind of protection. "Yet this does not depend only 
on the candidate," he said. Concern about the candidates' 
security increased after the murder of Mexico's PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] candidate Luis Colosio, who 
had been leading in the preference polls. Today Lula preferred 
to praise the protection he has received from the Federal Police 
and the military police in each state. "The minimum that each 
state is expected to do is to preserve the right of expression," 
he said. 
  In Vitoria (Espirito Santo) last Wednesday, a man carrying a 
dagger was apprehended near Lula's rostrum. Lula's private 
secretary Jose Carlos Spinosa said that "the police stripped him 
of his dagger and let him go." There were no indications that 
he had intended to use the dagger against Lula, but the episode 
served to alert the candidate's guards. "We are taking 
precautionary measures," Spinosa said, but did not admit that 
the bulletproof vest was one of those measures. Unlike in 1989, 
the PT this year requested the protection of the Federal Police 
and of the state civilian and military police to guard the 
candidate's physical well-being. This is guaranteed by the law. 
During Lula's campaign in Greater Porto Alegre, he was 
accompanied by two federal policemen and two military brigade 
vehicles.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The government will use approximately 
$160 million from the funds allocated for payment of the foreign 
debt to supply the Superior Electoral Court [TSE] with the funds 
needed to pay election expenses. The agreement was made 
yesterday by Planning Minister Beni Veras, PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] senator for Paraiba Raymundo Lyra -- the president of the 
Budget Committee of Congress -- and TSE President Sepulveda 
Pertence. The government chose this solution because the $160 
million that was to have been used for repaying the debt can be 
resupplied in August, once the budget bill has been voted on. 
  "If it needs the funds, the government can submit a message 
to Congress asking for inclusion of a supplemental credit in the 
budget. The budget will have been voted on by August, and there 
will be no problem," Lyra said.

  [Excerpts] Brasilia, 10 Jun (AE) -- Just one day after 
receiving a report from the military ministers, in which they 
warn of instability among the troops over low salaries, 
President Itamar Franco ordered Federal Administration Secretary 
Romildo Canhim to begin working next week with the Finance 
Ministry on a timetable to implement the equal salary plan among 
the three government branches. 
  This decision, which directly benefits the military and 
civil 
servants of the executive branch, was made during a nearly 
two-hour meeting with the four military ministers. 
  "It is impossible to maintain the current salary scale," 
President Itamar admitted during the meeting that was requested 
by the ministers who expressed total support for the equal 
salary treatment law. [passage omitted] 
  Federal Administration Secretary Canhim said he has no idea 
how long it will take to fully implement the equal salary plan. 
"Everything depends on the revenue collection capability, which 
we will now discuss with the Finance Ministry," he said.

  [Text] Brasilia, 11 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco 
sanctioned today, with three vetoes, the Antitrust Law (Number 
8884). This law was hastily approved last week by the Chamber 
of Deputies and the Senate. Despite the entrepreneurs' 
criticism of the original text, the vetoes did not eliminate any 
of the controversial items of the law, which was created to 
control price abuses. In a message sent to the Senate, the last 
house of the legislative branch to approve the draft antitrust 
bill, President Franco explained the reason for the three 
vetoes. One of them eliminated Article 79 from the law, as it 
would have rendered vacant the positions of advisers, president, 
and universal agent of Cade [Administrative Council for Economic 
Defense] until the Senate appoints new officials. 
  The blanks left by the vetoes were filled by a new 
provisional measure promulgated today by President Franco. This 
provisional measure will also help regulate the functioning of 
Cade until a draft bill on the issue is examined by Congress. 
  According to the provisional measure promulgated today, the 
positions of Cade president, advisers, and universal agent 
remain in effect. Cade has now become a self-supported 
government organization instead of just another organization 
under the Justice Ministry. In his message to the Senate, 
President Franco explained that the empty positions would make 
Cade nonfunctional at precisely a time when the government must 
control the companies to prevent inflation in the new currency, 
which is to go into circulation on 1 July. 
  The government created two more advisory positions. The 
mandates of the officials who will occupy them will end together 
with those of the current Cade members. In the future, the 
mandates will last two years and one year, to make it possible 
to renew 50 percent of the Cade board. 
  Another veto eliminated Article 22, which had been badly 
written. The article linked two simultaneous infractions -- 
unjustified increase in prices and charging excessively high 
prices -- to the Economic Policy Secretariat (SPE) of the 
Finance Ministry. By replacing the preposition "and" with "or," 
the new provisional measure allows the secretariat to take 
action in either case. 
  The provisional measure also establishes that as far as 
fines 
are concerned, the company's profit during the fiscal year 
preceding the filing of a Cade administrative lawsuit should be 
considered. The basis for the fine -- which can range between 1 
percent and 30 percent of company's profit -- must be corrected 
in accordance with the criteria used to update the payment of 
overdue federal taxes, until the fine is paid for. 
Independently from collecting the fine, the Economic Rights 
Secretariat [SDE] of the Justice Ministry will ask the 
prosecutor general to adopt the required judicial measures to 
prevent economic abuse if the preventive measures adopted by the 
SDE are not complied with. 
  President Franco also vetoed Article 82 of the law, which 
establishes that expenses involved with the implementation of 
Cade be paid for with budget funds allocated to the Justice 
Ministry. The provisional measure does not really clarify how 
the Ministry will meet these expenses.

  [Text] Brasilia, 9 Jun (AE) -- The military ministers have 
told President Itamar Franco about the pressure they are 
receiving from the troops who demand salary increases. They 
warned him of the worsening of the resentment in the barracks 
over low salaries. Military chiefs today leaked official reports 
passed to the president of the Republic in which they attempt to 
prove the unfeasibility of the domestic military budget which 
includes salaries that are considered dramatically low. "The 
budget does not cover our expenses," said Admiral Arnaldo Leite, 
chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff (EMFA). 
  Army Minister General Zenildo Lucena confirmed the concern 
felt among the military leadership and admitted that a 
disruption of discipline may occur, although in isolated 
incidents and within the scope of control of the commanders. 
Adm. Leite is not as optimistic and considers it risky to 
attempt to contain the troops' resentment without concrete 
solutions. 
  During a meeting at the EMFA headquarters today, the four 
military ministers decided to send President Itamar Franco a 
draft bill seeking to get Congress to establish a new salary 
system exclusively for the military. 
  In the report given to President Franco, the military 
leadership describes the situation as "unbearable." The report 
contains one worrisome fact, particularly regarding the 
recessive stage of the Real Plan: "What hurts the military most 
is that the sacrifice is not being shared equally among all 
public servants," the report states, adding: "Some employees are 
much better paid than others." 
  Adm. Leite stressed this serious aspect of the problem, 
mentioning the impunity with which businessmen commit price 
abuses, and asked for immediate and concrete measures against 
them. He said: "What hurts greedy businessmen most is not a 
prison sentence, but high fines. That way their pockets are 
affected, like ours." 
  To prove his complaints are well founded, Adm. Leite 
reported 
that a squadron admiral, the top post of the Navy career, with 
45 years of service, currently earns a gross salary of 2,000 
URV's [Real Value Unit] or a net salary of 1,300 URV's. Adm. 
Leite mentioned his fear of discord among the troops, adding: 
"If a soldier disobeys the rules we will arrest him, but this is 
not a solution." Leite believes the solution is a salary that 
at least allows military personnel to pay their bills, so as to 
prevent moonlighting -- which is not allowed. 
  The military document warns: "There is a risk of instability 
in the basic principles of hierarchy and discipline because 
subordinates blame their chiefs for their low salaries. Since 
they are prohibited from unionizing or striking, their chiefs -- 
that is, the Armed Forces Joint Chief of Staff -- must interpret 
their feelings and fight for the troops' demands." 
  Here is a list of the expenses of a lieutenant colonel 
graduated from the staff school and with 27 years of seniority, 
married, with two children, one in college and another one in 
high school, who is renting a three-room apartment in Grajau 
District, northern Rio de Janeiro: 
  His gross monthly salary amounts to 1,329 URV's. (All 
figures 
are in URV) [1 URV is approximately equal to $1]. 
  Gross salary (monthly): 1,329 
  Obligatory discounts (military pension fund, health fund, 
income tax): 298 
  Net salary: 1,031 
  Expenses (monthly): 
  School (college, high school, English lessons): 518 
  Rent: 340 
  Energy, telephone, gas, and water: 168 
  Garbage collection: 2 
  Food: 350 
  Maid (earning a minimum salary, INSS [National Social 
Security Institute] contribution, transportation): 80 
  Savings account (gross 10 percent to pay for a housing 
loan): 199 
  Fuel and bus, subway fares: 86 
  IPVA [expansion unknown] (expenses for Volkswagen Gol 
utility vehicle): 38 
  Clothes and shoes: 42 
  Health expenses: 64 
  Military Club monthly fee: 14 
  Minimum leisure (going to the movies twice a month): 30 
  Personal expenses (barber, snacks, children's allowances, 
newspaper): 99 
  Total expenses: 2030 
  Deficit: 999 
  Adjustment needed: 97 percent.

<F P=106> [Report by Roberta Jansen] </F>
  [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 12 Jun (AE) -- Aeronautics Minister 
Lelio Viana Lobo today said that the low salaries paid to the 
military "are undermining the foundations of the institution" 
and are causing "uneasiness" in the barracks. "Love for the 
Fatherland maintains our discipline," he said, repeating the 
words of Navy Minister Admiral Ivan Serpa. Lobo attended the 
commemoration of the 63d anniversary of the National Air Mail 
Service at Campo dos Afonsos, in northern Rio de Janeiro, where 
he attended a mass and air shows. 
  "For a long time now we have been trying to show to the 
government and to the people the distressing situation we are 
experiencing," the minister said. Lobo, one of the designers of 
the bill that provides for an average 35 percent salary 
increase, hopes that President Itamar Franco will immediately 
sign the provisional measure on the new law for military 
salaries. "It is unfeasible to continue to earn a salary with 
which we cannot live even a modest life," he claimed. "We know 
the entire country is going through difficulties, but it is 
important to solve this matter as soon as possible," he added. 
  The minister recalled that all military demands have been 
made with due respect for the institution's hierarchy and 
discipline. "We have no union, and we hold no marches," he said. 
Brigadier Armando Arquimedes, chief of the Social 
Communications Center of the Aeronautics Ministry, who was 
accompanying Lobo, denied that the mistakes in the playing of 
the national anthem last Friday, during a ceremony attended by 
President Franco and the Navy minister, were meant to protest 
the low salaries. "We do not protest that way. It was a 
protocol mistake," Arquimedes said. 
  Concerning the proposal by PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to create a defense ministry 
gathering the three military ministries, Lobo said that the idea 
must be carefully studied. "We have worked with a spirit of 
cooperation for more than 50 years," he said, hinting that it is 
not necessary to unite the three forces. The minister said that 
if asked -- as has been promised by some of the candidates for 
governor in the state -- the Air Force will cooperate in the 
fight against violence in Rio de Janeiro.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>
  [Text] At the beginning of May, the Argentine Government 
asked Brazilian authorities to investigate the European Union's 
(EU) alleged provision of subsidies to its malt and barley 
exports to Brazil. The same procedure was used some months 
before to demand Brazilian action against Canada, which was 
allegedly harming Argentine wheat exports to Brazil. 
  Argentine Ambassador Alieto Guadagni yesterday confirmed to 
this newspaper that his government sent a note to Brazil on the 
basis of Resolution No. 3/92 of the Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] Council, which allows a signatory country to ask 
another signatory country to begin an investigation if it feels 
harmed by unfair commercial practices by third countries. In the 
case of wheat, the Brazilian Government agreed with the 
Argentine Government, which asked for an investigation into 
Canada's alleged "dumping" practice. Brazil is still 
investigating Canada. Concerning malt, the Ministry of Industry, 
Commerce, and Tourism reported that the government has not yet 
adopted a position, because the Argentine request is still 
recent. 
  Official sources, however, have said that it is necessary to 
decide what to do with Mercosur legislation, because if a case 
begins on the basis of the Treaty of Asuncion, it will have to 
conform to Mercosur laws. 
  At least two Mercosur members -- Brazil and Argentina -- 
import subsidized EU products. 
  Argentina imports subsidized pork from Denmark and powdered 
milk from the Netherlands, Brazilian sources have said. 
  In the case of malt, Argentina has complained that Brazil, 
its main market -- Brazil buys 90 of Argentine malt exports -- 
has increased its malt purchases from France and Belgium, which 
are Europe's main producers. It has been reported that Argentina 
sold Brazil 94,000 tons of malt in 1991, while the EU exported 
200,000 tons. Last year, Argentina sold 55,000 tons on the 
Brazilian market. Brazil consumes 600,000 tons of malt, of which 
200,000 are produced locally. 
  The Argentine Government claims that if no subsidies were 
being paid on malt, the EU product would be sold in Brazil for 
$480, instead of $260, per ton. "There is an 85 percent 
reduction in the European price because of a $201 subsidy per 
ton of malt," an Argentine entrepreneurial source explained. The 
average price of the Argentine product in 1992 was $300 per ton. 
  According to the EU delegation in Brasilia, the standard or 
domestic price for the harvesting period that will be over at 
the end of this month is $150 per ton. If the international 
price stands below this ceiling, the EU producer is entitled to 
compensation. 
  The Argentine Government has estimated a potential loss of 
$70 million for its malt sector. The Pampa Malt Plant, which is 
a partnership between Brahma and an Argentine group -- 
headquartered in Buenos Aires Province -- has reportedly reduced 
its production because of Brazilian imports from the EU.

<F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>
  [Text] The economic team believes that it is losing control 
of the Real Plan. After President Itamar Franco trampled on it 
in the chapters on rents, school fees, and the antitrust law, 
the economic team now finds itself facing a greater threat: the 
regulation of banking interest rates. 
  President Franco has asked Deputy Benito Gama (PFL-BA) 
[Liberal Front Party - Bahia] to hasten the presentation of the 
draft bill regulating Article 192, Paragraph 3, of the 
Constitution, which establishes that real interest rates (not 
including the inflation rate) cannot surpass 12 percent 
annually. (Public federal bonds currently earn an interest rate 
of 25 percent.) 
  But it so happens that Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero had 
asked Deputy Gama exactly the opposite, that is, to delay as 
much as possible the presentation of the aforementioned draft 
bill. 
  Deputy Gama presides over the special Chamber of Deputies 
Committee that will present the draft bill by order of the 
Federal Supreme Court. The first deadline for presenting the 
draft bill is 20 June, but Gama had agreed with Ricupero that he 
will ask for an extension of the deadline. 
  All the members of the economic team, without exception, 
consider it absurd to regulate interest rates. According to 
them, it is wrong in theory, unfeasible in practice, and 
politically incorrect. 
  President Itamar maintains a populist view that high 
interest 
rates are caused by bank profiteering with the connivance of the 
Central Bank, while the economic team members believe that the 
high interest rates are the consequence of the chronic 
inflationary state of the Brazilian economy. 
  The whole logic of the Real Plan foresees minimum government 
intervention in the economy. If government intervention is 
necessary, the idea is to maintain economic neutrality so that 
contracts in the new currency maintain the same equilibrium. 
  Directly inspired by President Itamar, exactly the opposite 
was done with the conversion [into URV, real value unit] of the 
school fees. Although they officially remain silent, the 
economic team members believe that the formula to convert the 
school fees [into URV] is simply absurd, because it takes into 
account the nominal average fees of the previous four months 
rather than the nominal real average fees. 
  The economic team also believes that the president's 
intervention undermined the rent issue. Besides, the delay in 
making a decision has resulted in some inflation points being 
carried over to the inflation rate of July, the first month in 
which the real will come into circulation. The rent contracts 
that are converted into URV now will be paid in June, and they 
will then be included in the composition of prices. 
  The economic team members believe that the uproar the 
president made over the antitrust law has had a single effect: 
an effective increase of prices, besides creating an atmosphere 
of instability which is something very negative for the new 
currency. 
  They believe that it is not necessary to issue an arrest 
warrant against businessmen to make them lower their prices. 
They believe that prices will remain stable because the public 
deficit will be under control, the economy restrained, without 
any excessive demands, and because the real will break the 
inflationary inertia.

  [Text] Sorocaba, Sao Paulo, 9 Jun (AE) -- Navy Ministry 
civilian employees who work at the Aramar Experimental Center 
[Centro Experimental Aramar] in Ipero, 130 km from Sao Paulo, 
are being evicted from the houses that were built by the Navy in 
the 1980's for nuclear scientists and engineers who worked at 
the center. Aramar is where the Navy developed the uranium 
enrichment technology used in the construction of the first 
Brazilian nuclear submarine. Some of the civilian employees 
threatened with eviction are among Brazil's top nuclear experts. 
  The eviction order was given by Admiral Domingos Alfredo da 
Silva, director general of the Navy material department. He is 
one rank above Admiral Othon Luis Pinheiro da Silva, president 
of the Coordinating Center for Special Projects (Copesp), the 
agency that administers the Aramar center. The scientists have 
been given until 29 June to leave the Navy houses. 
  The civilian employees, who did not want to be identified to 
avoid being dismissed, said the measure affects dozens of 
experts from Sao Paulo and other states who moved to the area 
when they were hired by the Navy. One of them said: "The houses 
were offered as compensation for moving our residences, given 
that Navy salaries have always been below market salaries." 
Nearly 1,000 civilian and military employees live in Aramar. 
They say the 650 civilians are being discriminated against. 
  One consequence of this move will be the flight of experts 
in 
ultra centrifuge techniques and in other subjects that the Navy 
Ministry considers strategic. The Aramar nuclear program has so 
far cost the Brazilian Government nearly $700 million. 
  The material department director and the Copesp president 
were sought by journalists yesterday to explain the eviction of 
civilian employees. Advisers reported that Navy officers can 
only speak to journalists with the authorization of the office 
of Navy Minister Ivan Andrade Serpa. Although his office was 
contacted by fax, there has been no answer so far.

<F P=106> [Report by Antonio Jose do Carmo] </F>
  [Text] Ribas do Rio Pardo, 10 Jun (AE) -- One year after 
the invasion of 83,000 hectares of a eucalyptus reforestation 
area in the Mato Grosso do Sul county of Ribas do Rio Pardo, 150 
km from Campo Grande, the landowner has filed a request with the 
courts demanding the restoration of his right to possession of 
the land, and the eviction of at least 1,000 families who have 
settled on the ranch, building fences, planting grass, and 
feeding cattle. 
  Industrialist Leo Chueri, the landowner, said the hundreds 
of 
intruders are ranchers and owners of small estates in Sao Paulo 
State. The announcement of their possible eviction has increased 
tension among settlers. Contrary to other movements that remain 
organized behind unions and church leadership, the Ribas de Rio 
Pardo settlers are not organized. Each one chose an area 
according to his own economic capacity, hiring armed foremen to 
guard their sites. 
  The Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable 
Natural Resources (Ibama) and the National Land Reform and 
Settlement Institute have both produced reports saying that the 
land is inappropriate for agriculture. Yet cattle breeders have 
succeeded with their grass plantations. 
  The elite of intruders, who are also called the 
"landowners," 
even include a deputy whose name is on the official list 
submitted by the ranch owner. Roberto Razuk (PMDB) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party] is considered the strongest invader 
of the ranch. He maintains an armed group. The deputy could not 
be found to comment on the accusation. 
  Judge Raul Roveda, of Ribas de Rio Pardo, ordered the 
removal 
of settlers from 18,000 hectares. This area was occupied by 
hundreds of families of itinerant workers who were hired by the 
Union of Rural Workers of Ribas de Rio Pardo. Most of them 
claim to have no land on which to graze the cattle they are now 
grazing on the abandoned reforestation project land. The 
landowner, however, claims that "the courts can be human only 
with men, women and children; the cattle must be put on the 
highway."

<F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira in Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao </F>
Paulo State] 
  [Excerpts] From 30 August to 4 September, the Army Air 
Command (Comavex) [Comando de Aviacao do Exercito] will host in 
Taubate (Sao Paulo State) the first International Helicopter 
Fair in Latin America (Hexpo/94). GPM Events, Promotions and 
Informatics -- the company responsible for organizing the fair 
-- has already sold 45 of the 90 stands available at the fair, 
where equipment and aircraft worth more than $600 million will 
be on display. 
  Large manufacturers of helicopters and suppliers of aircraft 
parts and equipment have already confirmed their attendance at 
the fair, which is expected to attract more than 200,000 people. 
Among those who will be attending Hexpo/94 are Eurocopter (a 
merger of the French Aerospatiale with the German MBB), which is 
represented in Brazil by Helibras [Brazilian Helicopters, Inc.]; 
Bell, which is represented by Lider Taxi Aereo; Rolls Royce, 
Celma, Motortec, TAM, Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum 
Corporation], Bank of Brazil, and others. 
  GPM President Jose Fernando Portugal said his company is 
investing $160,000 in organizing the fair. In addition to the 
exposition, the fair includes a seminar on flight safety, shows, 
flying demonstrations, and the first Brazilian helicopter flying 
competition. 
  The fair will devote an area of 5,800 square meters to 
aircraft exposition, and 3,800 square meters will be earmarked 
for exposition of equipment and aircraft of the Aeronautics, 
Army, and Navy Ministries. There will be 90 stands, the sizes 
of which will range from 6 to 144 square meters. [passage 
omitted] 
  The Taubate-based Army Air Command, which was built in 1986, 
houses the largest helicopter fleet in Brazil. Its current 
fleet consists of 52 helicopters, 36 of which are Panthers (two 
turbines and 12 seats) while 16 are Esquilo models (the light 
type, with six seats).

  [Text] The main objective of the National Biodiversity 
Program that the Ministry of Environment and the Amazon Region 
will set in motion in Rio de Janeiro on 17 June is to obtain 
more detailed knowledge of the living organisms in Brazil, which 
represent 15 percent of all the living organisms in the world, 
and to explore their sustainable use. "We want to open a 
registry based on proposed projects," Haroldo Mattos de Lemos, 
Brazil's Secretary for Environmental Affairs, said yesterday in 
Porto Alegre. Mattos de Lemos attended the 7th State 
Environmental Conference (Confema), which was sponsored by the 
Rio Grande do Sul government and the State Foundation for 
Environmental Preservation (Fepam) with the support of Germany's 
GTZ [German Society for Technical Cooperation] environmental 
agency. 
  Lemos reported that 30 million living organisms are believed 
to exist on the planet, but that only 1.5 million are 
scientifically known, while approximately 100 species are 
eliminated or lost every day. 
  The government has already guaranteed the provision of $48 
million for financing the National Biodiversity Program, of 
which $30 million were granted by the World Bank (IBRD) and will 
be transferred through the Global Environment Facility (GEF). 
Lemos said: "The priorities for allocation of the funds have 
not yet been defined. The idea is to establish practical 
partnerships between the government, the private sector, and the 
civil sector." No budget limits have been set for individual 
projects, he added. 
  At the end of May, Lemos attended a meeting of the United 
Nations commission for supervision of compliance with the 
decisions made by Eco-92 [United Nations Conference for 
Environment and Development], which was held in Rio de Janeiro. 
He believes progress has been made in the implementation of 
conventions on biodiversity and climate change, which have 
already been enforced. "There is consensus on the registration 
of patents for the protection of intellectual property, while 
developed countries are willing to share the profits with the 
countries from which genetic resources are obtained for 
research," he said. 
  Negotiations are moving more slowly over the increase from 
0.33 to 0.7 percent of GDP from the rich countries that should 
be allocated to environmental preservation in the developing 
countries. "In the case of Brazil, it is also necessary to 
interpret Agenda 21 in terms of local features, as has been done 
in China, which set goals for the next century," he said. This 
will be one of the main missions of an interministerial council 
that the federal government intends to create to set the rules 
for sustained development in Brazil. 
  Lemos briefed Confema delegates on the operation of the 
Decentralized Implementation Program, which was agreed upon with 
the IBRD three weeks ago. The program will allocate $61 million 
(70 percent of which will be provided by the IBRD) for 
environmental projects that will be picked up by the Ministry of 
Environment and the Amazon Region and by registered state 
governments. The states that intend to register for the program 
will have to meet at least seven requirements, some of which are 
compulsory: preparation of environmental legislation consistent 
with the Constitution, creation of a state environmental council 
(a requirement that Rio Grande do Sul has not yet met), the 
issuance of environment permits for large undertakings, and the 
creation of legal advisory services to advise the population on 
environmental matters. 
  Each state may strive to obtain funds for up to six projects 
over a period ending 30 March 1995. Funds will be transferred 
directly to the municipal governments involved.

  [Text] No one has yet proposed it, but the possibility of 
exchanging the Angra-II nuclear power plant -- which Brazil 
purchased from Germany and which remains fully packed -- for a 
Russian nuclear submarine, is already being considered. Brazil 
is striving to enlarge its submarine fleet and is building a 
nuclear submarine, while Russia badly needs nuclear plants to 
replace its old reactors that run the risk of causing a tragedy 
at any time. They do not need submarines, which they have in 
excess and which are expensive to maintain. We do not need the 
plant, which we bought without needing it and without having the 
money to install it.

  [Excerpt] The Brazilian Telecommunications Code, which was 
created 31 years ago to grant concessions on radio and 
television stations in the country, has become a work of fiction. 
  The code forbids the concentration of the market and 
establishes that no entity or person can own more than 10 
television stations nationwide. Five of those, at most, may be 
VHF (Channels 1 through 13). 
  The family of entrepreneur Roberto Marinho (Globo Network) 
has shares in 17 television stations, 15 of which are VHF. 
  The official registers of the Communications Ministry show 
the Marinho family has 10 television concessions (eight VHF and 
two UHF, that is, Channels 14 and above). They also have shares 
in four other VHF stations in Parana State, two in Sao Paulo 
State, and one in Minas Gerais State. 
  The Sirotsky family (RBS Network) has concessions for 13 VHF 
television stations and shares in another station in Espirito 
Santo State. 
  The Saad family (Bandeirantes), the Abravanel family (SBT, 
Silvio Santos groups), and the Camara family (of the Anhanguera 
family in the Center-West Region) all surpass the limit of five 
VHF television stations in the entire country. 
  The Bandeirantes group has concessions for nine VHF 
television stations, SBT has eight (plus one UHF station), and 
the Camara family has seven. 
  These oligopolies are the result of a loophole in the law: 
It 
established limits for entities and people, but it does not 
consider one simple trick -- registering the concessions in the 
name of several companies or several members of the same family.

  [Text] Brasilia -- Brazil has become the main warehouse for 
the cocaine consumed in the United States and Europe. Last 
week's record seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine dispelled 
any remaining doubts about the key role the country plays in 
shipping cocaine produced in Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. In 
addition to distributing drugs to other countries, for the past 
four years there has been a new twist in Brazil's trafficking 
activities that concerns police authorities: Brazil is producing 
cocaine. 
  The Federal Police [PF] believe at least 2 percent of 
Colombian-owned refining laboratories have been operating in 
Brazilian territory since 1990. 
  Sergio Sakon, chief of the PF Narcotics Enforcement 
Department, rules out the possibility that this percentage will 
increase in the next few years. In addition to difficulties in 
transporting the cocaine base -- a coca by-product -- into 
Brazil, there are no experts in cocaine refining in the country. 
Brazilian laboratories are operated by Colombian and Bolivian 
"cooks," who attract attention in border areas and thus increase 
the risk of a police crackdown. 
  Sakon added: Furthermore, laboratories require the 
cooperation of their host communities. They can get this 
cooperation in Colombia, but not in Brazil. 
  Studies by the DEA (the U.S. drug enforcement organization) 
show, however, that U.S. military actions against the Colombian 
cartels have resulted in the laboratories being moved to safer 
ground, mainly to the Brazilian border with Colombia, Bolivia, 
and Peru. The Brazilian region that houses the laboratories is 
identical to the areas where the main cocaine refining 
laboratories are located in the three neighboring countries: 
Tropical forests and savannas.

  [Text] Panama, 12 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- U.S. Army South, based 
in the Panama Canal area, today sent 37 troops in two "CH-47 
Chinook" helicopters to Colombia to help victims of the 
earthquake and subsequent floods, which have left several towns 
mired in mud. 
  A U.S. Army South communique says the troops sent to 
Colombia 
are specialists in meteorology, air traffic control, 
civilian-military operations, security, and medical treatment. 
The U.S. troops' mission is to transport Colombian Government 
first aid personnel and supplies and to evacuate disaster 
victims. 
  The Neiva Airport in Colombia is serving as an operations 
center and a storage center for supplies that will later be 
transported by helicopter to affected areas that are 
inaccessible by land following last week's earthquake. 
  The strong earthquake, which resulted in hundreds of deaths 
and disappearances early this week, was part of a wave of 
earthquakes that "bounced" among Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Paraguay, 
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, the United 
States, and Canada. Earthquakes have recently increased in the 
so-called "circle of fire" in the Pacific, which includes all 
countries on the Pacific coast.

<F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat by reporter </F>
Bernardo de la Maza upon his return from a seminar organized by 
the Inter-American Development Bank and the INTERNATIONAL HERALD 
TRIBUNE in London -- recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Aninat] We met with several 
U.K. authorities--particularly with Michael Portillo, the chief 
secretary to the Treasury, and with the governor of the Central 
Bank. We observed the great interest being shown by such 
important countries as the United Kingdom in Chilean economic 
development and in future British investments in the Chilean 
market. We are creating great expectations. 
  [De la Maza] How do well-informed sectors in Europe view 
Chilean negotiations with NAFTA and with Mercosur [Common Market 
of the South]? 
  [Aninat] With great interest and with special attention 
because it amazes them that Chile is undertaking two practically 
concurrent major negotiations, namely negotiating with North 
American countries--the United States, Canada, and Mexico--and 
with Mercosur member countries. This is a positive indication 
that we are maturing and gaining access to other types of 
alliance. This is how they see us. I say with special attention 
because EU countries do not want to be left out of Latin 
America, or Chile in particular, through this type of 
negotiations. This is very interesting for us and we should 
propose special relations with European countries. 
  [De la Maza] In light of the criticism voiced about Chile's 
possible incorporation into NAFTA, from the workers' standpoint, 
how will joining NAFTA be to their advantage? 
  [Aninat] For one fundamental reason: Chile has been on an 
export drive for more than 10 years, an outward-looking policy 
that seeks to promote exports. The performance of those sectors 
is fundamental for investments and employment. Moreover, Chile 
is a poor country which does not have enough capital at its 
disposal to undertake every interesting investment project. As 
we attract capital by promoting more investments in our country, 
there will be better and more productive employment. This is the 
key to sustainable wage increases. In other words, increasing 
productivity will mean workers will have more capital, 
technology, and technical knowledge about investments at their 
disposal which will, in turn, increase employment levels and 
productivity. 
  [De la Maza] Many people wonder why Chile is so interested 
in 
joining NAFTA when we already have special tariffs on a 
considerable slice of our exports into the United States and we 
have a bilateral agreement with Mexico establishing zero tariffs. 
  [Aninat] Joining NAFTA is not a matter of life and death. It 
is an important and complex negotiation, but it is neither 
unique nor a decisive negotiation. The lower tariffs on our 
products--which average a reduction of 3 percent--are to a large 
extent based on the premise that Chile will for ever be subject 
to the general system of preferences. These are unilateral 
preferences that the Unites States graciously grants if it so 
desires. We want a guaranteed and stable access and an openness 
over our trade with the United States. 
  [De la Maza] What is your overall assessment of our economy? 
  [Aninat] I believe we are doing fine. There is some 
impatience among some business sectors but I think we are doing 
fine in terms of the adjustment between spending, revenues, and 
our projection for the rest of the year. There is no doubt that 
inflation will drop in the second semester and we will see that 
our growth rate this year will be 4 percent. This is a little 
lower than last year but it will consolidate one great step 
forward and enable us to grow by 5 or 6 percent in real terms in 
1995. 
  [De la Maza] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Minister Secretary General of Government Victor 
Manuel Rebolledo yesterday ruled out any possibility that 
President Eduardo Frei's government will promote a new amnesty 
law to benefit those who are responsible for violating human 
rights. 
  The minister was consulted about initiatives in this 
direction by Center Alliance Party [PAC] President Adolfo Ballas. 
  Rebolledo said: "In our capacity as government we believe 
that, in compliance with the laws currently in force, the 
court's rulings on this matter must be respected." 
  He said that this was the governing coalition's proposal 
regarding the human rights subject in its government program. 
  He added: "The idea of a new amnesty law has not been 
considered." 
  The proposal made by Ballas, who proposed a new amnesty law 
that would benefit military officers who had been tried and 
civilians involved in terrorist attacks, was flatly rejected by 
the members of the Communist Party [PC]. 
  Yesterday the Leftist Democratic Party, like the PC, 
categorically rejected the new amnesty law proposed by the PAC. 
  PDI Secretary General Antonio Leal said that the initiative 
would only establish a precedent of a new "pardon" that lacks 
any ethics. 
  Leal said it is immoral for this possible amnesty law to be 
proposed by the president of a member party of the coalition 
because it implies ignoring the governing bloc's policy on the 
subject as well as affecting the performance of the magistrates 
who currently hear cases involving violations of human rights.

  [Text] Santiago, 7 Jun (EFE) -- Chilean Planning and 
Cooperation Minister Luis Maira today said that President 
Eduardo Frei's government will reallocate public expenditures to 
be able to more effectively fight the poverty affecting 4.5 
million Chileans. 
  Minister Maira asserted that together with the Finance 
Ministry efforts are being made to draft a budget that, while 
observing a balanced allocation of funds, "will allow us to use 
the resources as best possible, granting priority to the various 
public sector projects." 
  The minister announced that a Latin American Social and 
Poverty Funds Network [Red Lationamericana de Fondos Sociales y 
de Pobreza] will be created in Santiago on 20 June. 
  To this purpose a regional meeting to discuss "alternatives 
to financing programs designed to overcome poverty" will be 
held. A total of 21 Latin American and Caribbean delegations 
will participate in this event. 
  The current government has made the struggle against poverty 
its priority target. The government intends to pull the 1.2 
million Chileans who currently live in extreme poverty out of 
this situation. 
  Today Maira explained that the National Program to Overcome 
Poverty has no populist purpose. 
  The Planning Minister said: "We have carefully tried to 
avoid 
creating overblown expectations. We have not set regional 
targets or objectives that could suggest improvements greater 
than conditions will allow."

  [Text] National Defense Chief of Staff Jorge Patricio 
Arancibia has stated that the Armed Forces favor compulsory 
military service because it helps to safeguard society. 
  Vice Admiral Arancibia said military service enables youths 
to acquire values and principles, and helps them to understand 
professional training. 
  Arancibia said of the 121,000 who registered in 1993, only 
29,400 were drafted. He added that the Army and the Air Force 
have already reduced military service to one year, while the 
Navy is studying this possibility. 
  Asked about the Argentine decision to create a professional 
Army, he said the Chilean Armed Forces should also study this 
issue. He declined to say if the Argentine decision constitutes 
a threat because Argentina has yet to implement this decision. 
Arancibia admitted, however, that a professional Army is more 
effective than a nonprofessional Army although it is more costly.

  [Text] Santiago, 14 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Investigative 
Police arrested Sergio Buschmann today at the international 
airport. Buschmann, who has been a fugitive since 1987, returned 
voluntarily from Nicaragua. 
  More than 200 peple were waiting at the airport for 
Buschmann, who arrived from Costa Rica after a three-hour delay. 
Among those waiting for him were leftist opposition leaders who 
went to the airport to express their solidarity with him. 
  Buschmann, a 51-year-old theater actor and one of the 
founders of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (FPMR), was 
arrested during the past military regime. He was accused of 
leading an operation to conceal weapons the FPMR had smuggled 
into Chile in 1986. 
  The following year he escaped from prison and left the 
country clandestinely. Today he is returning to exercise, as he 
said, his legitimate right to defend himself and to resume his 
life legally.

<F P=106> [Press conference by Marcel Laniado, president of the </F>
National Modernization Council; place and date not given] 
  [Text] "We are not going to fall into the trap of 
reorganizing social security. That is not the wise thing. The 
people of Ecuador need an answer," Marcel Laniado, the president 
of the National Modernization Council (CONAM), has said. 
  Laniado has announced radical changes in this sector so that 
those insured "will have basic choices, with guaranteed future 
pensions and medical care for themselves and their families when 
they are ill." 
  In a lengthy discussion with the publishers, editors, and 
reporters of HOY, Laniado defined the six major priorities in 
the launching of the reorganization in the state sector. They 
pertain to social security, telecommunications, airports, 
customs, the Civil Registry, and maritime ports. 
  At the same time, he announced that both public and private 
activity will be demonopolized. To this end, a code is being 
drafted to provide these two sectors with a body that will 
provide them with adequate service and will denounce any 
irregularities or abuses. 
<H5>  The Six Priorities </H5>
  -- Emphasizing the social security issue, the president of 
the CONAM indicated that the accusations made about the quality 
of care in social security indicate that those who are managing 
this sector do not value life. 
  "What social security has done to us is unforgivable. The 
workers are contributing 23 percent, but they are not receiving 
any benefits. Even the widows cannot obtain aid funds promptly," 
he stressed. 
  After noting that the social security institution is totally 
disorganized and has had no accounting system for the past 10 
years, Laniado announced that plans have been made to establish 
a parallel system. With this system, the members will know what 
is guaranteed them, how much they will receive per month, where 
they and their families can go for medical care, how much it 
will cost them, and what they will be able to save for their 
retirement. 
  He said, the system is not so simple, however. This is 
because it requires a decision on the part of the insured party 
as to where he wants to deposit his funds, his contributions, in 
order to obtain the best guarantees and insurance. "I do not 
know if a project like this can be launched in just two, three, 
or four months." 
  -- On the telecommunications issue, the president of the 
CONAM said the entity in charge of this sector is one of the 
most backward. "This is a corrupt sector, as a result of 
tremendous disorganization. We do not have adequate technology, 
and there is an insufficient number of lines." 
  With a view to structural change, finding the best possible 
solutions, and putting the chaos behind us, bids will be 
solicited from consulting firms. Concessions for providing 
services will be granted to international enterprises, and they 
will bring in new capital and technology. 
  Laniado hopes that this will enable Ecuador to enter the 
world of technology and telecommunications within a short time. 
  For the modernization and management of the airports in 
Quito 
and Guayaquil, similar bids will be solicited, and specialized 
firms will execute this project in association with domestic 
groups, using the current infrastructure. "Glorified projects 
are not required in order to provide decent service," this 
official emphasized. 
  Maritime port services will also be given concessions. What 
is wanted is for the vessels to have "an adequate system, one 
that is not corrupt, as is the case now." 
  According to the president of the CONAM, the ports in 
Ecuador, and that in Guayaquil, in particular, are not 
competitive with the ports in the neighboring countries. The 
vessels arriving at ports in Ecuador face fees that are higher 
than normal. "There is theft, carelessness, and delay in 
unloading goods." 
  "There will be a veritable shakeup in the customs service so 
as to change the current smuggling system, which is one of the 
speediest paths to illegal enrichment." 
  Marcel Laniado announced that four internationally known 
enterprises established in the country will be responsible for 
certifying the invoicing of all the products imported into 
Ecuador. Each importer will be able to sign a contract with one 
of these enterprises, which will be paid one percent of the 
total value of the goods imported. 
  The importer's invoice will have to show certification by 
this firm, which will calculate the taxes and pay the amount 
owed into any bank. 
  This mechanism will eliminate import permits, as well as the 
22 steps that must currently be completed in order to effect an 
import. At the same time, it will make it possible for the 
release of goods from customs within four hours of their arrival 
in the country. 
  The president of the CONAM warned that any irregularities 
for 
which the importer is responsible will entail serious criminal 
penalties. At the same time, the customs appraisers and 
assessors, and any possibility of bribery, will be eliminated. 
"This is a way of making the system honest. The country will 
benefit from the income generated by the customs duties 
collected on imported goods." 
  The same procedure will be applied for exports. 
  Prior to the reorganization of the Civil Registry structure, 
a study was undertaken. Now complete, the study reveals the 
critical situation in this sector. 
  Laniado announced that as of 31 May, a call for bids will be 
issued, after which certain enterprises will be allowed to 
manage the issuance of identity cards and other certificates on 
a concession basis. 
  It is possible that notaries will continue to provide the 
certified copies of birth and marriage certificates. To this 
end, standard offices managed by businessmen interested in 
providing this service will be established. 
  This, however, will entail an increase in the fee paid from 
the laughable sum of five sucres currently being charged for a 
birth certificate to some 5,000 or 6,000 sucres. 
  The system will be automated so as to make it possible for 
citizens to obtain identity cards in any part of the country. 
  The computer center will be located in Quito, and it will 
have three sections, with their respective officials -- the 
Civil Registry, the Supreme Electoral Board, and an 
internationally qualified auditing department. 
<H5>  Defining Modernization </H5>
  The concepts of modernization and privatization are being 
confused, Marcel Laniado, the head of the CONAM, says. Most 
people think that modernization means privatization. 
  He said what is to be privatized is all of the enterprises 
that fail to serve a social function, and those in which the 
state has no involvement -- the cement enterprises, for example. 
This would involve initiating the disinvestment process, which 
is being pursued by the National Financing Corporation (CFN) and 
the National Development Bank. The state is selling all of its 
shares in the enterprises in whose activities it has no 
involvement. 
  Where the other sectors are concerned, this official 
emphasized that their activities will be parceled out on a 
concession basis. For example, the Paute hydroelectric plant 
will not be sold, but will be entrusted as a concession to an 
enterprise that will manage it and guarantee its maintenance. 
  Similar steps will be taken in the communications, oil, 
airport, and other sectors. 
  Laniado explained that modernization does not in any way 
mean 
unemployment. When efficient private enterprises take the 
responsibility for providing services, these services will 
expand, and more manpower will therefore be needed. In the 
telephone sector, for example, a larger number of lines will be 
made available, and the number of workers needed to install them 
will increase. 
  In Laniado's opinion, the private sector could offer better 
service and management than the state institutions, which have 
no channels for filing claims. 
  According to this official, there is talk of modernization 
in 
the country because there is backwardness in every respect. The 
lag does not just exist in comparison to other industrialized 
countries, but in comparison to the country's neighbors, as well. 
  "Our educational system is disastrously behind the times. It 
cannot even be compared with the educational systems in other 
parts of Latin America. Thus the situation needs to be changed," 
he explained. 
  There is also a lag in the technology sector, but the 
problem 
here can be resolved more quickly with the influx of foreign 
investment the country is expecting, which will be accompanied 
by technological renewal.

  [Text] Our government will begin to receive about $100 
million per year in revenues from the Salto Grande hydroelectric 
dam project following the signing by Uruguayan Foreign Minister 
Sergio Abreu and Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella 
yesterday in Buenos Aires of an agreement on the exchange of 
notes on financial streamlining, a new rate system, and a future 
reorganization of the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission. 
  This agreement marks the completion of one stage of this 
joint hydroelectric project, which began on 1 April 1974, and 
the opening of a promising cooperation stage in the field of 
electric power interconnection as it follows existing efforts 
toward full electric power integration between Argentina and 
Uruguay. 
  The agreement complements an act signed a few days ago 
within 
the framework of an agreement on electric power interconnection. 
Under this act, Argentina will purchase Uruguay's surplus 
electricity from its Salto Grande dam at 80 percent of the 
Argentine spot [preceding word in English] market prices. 
  The financial streamlining of the Salto Grande Joint 
Technical Commission is the main outcome of the agreement. 
Thanks to the compensation [not further specified] on its loans 
and debts, the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission will have 
no liability whatsoever. 
  The agreement also provides for the payment of a debt 
arising 
from compensation that Uruguay had to honor, involving unpaid 
dam construction loans and UTE [General Administration of State 
Electric Power and Telephones] bills totaling about $380 
million. These bills will be paid directly by UTE to the 
Argentine Republic, which has granted an 11-year deadline. 
  This financial streamlining paves the way for the 
hydroelectric project to immediately yield about $100 million 
per year in revenues for our government. 
  This agreement also opens a negotiations stage for 
reorganizing the Salto Grande Joint Technical Commission. The 
negotiations will seek to reorganize the commission's 
jurisdiction, concentrating its activities in electric power 
output and distribution and the adjustment of its operation 
costs. 
  The agreement establishes the formation of a working group, 
coordinated by the two Foreign Ministries, to submit within 60 
days a report on the binational agency's institutional 
reorganization.

  [Text] While thousands of people were arriving in Florida 
[department] to participate in the San Cono pilgrimage, an 
enormous truck carrying a bulky cargo arrived at the Florida 
Free Zone [near the town of Piedra Alta]. It was carrying the 
first prefabricated Russian helicopter to arrive here. The 
helicopter will be meticulously assembled in the customs area. 
  The Ka-32 helicopter, which was used by the Soviet Army 
during the invasion of Afghanistan, is now being offered to 
several governments because of its excellent maneuverability and 
efficiency. 
  Imaribo S.A., headed by George Bitar and Alex 
Grebenchtchykov, has negotiated the sale of several of these 
helicopters to South American countries. 
  To improve the operation, the enterprise is installed within 
the Florida Free Zone, where the helicopters will be fully 
assembled by seven Russian engineers who will reside in the city 
of Piedra Alta. 
  Luis Calachi is in charge of the free zone. He told EL 
OBSERVADOR that each helicopters costs $2.5 million and that 
Imaribo S.A. intends to build an assembly plant in the free zone 
to assemble the helicopters that are sold in this region of 
America. 
  The container in which these helicopters are shipped is the 
size of six 20-foot containers. The first arrived on 3 June and 
was escorted by Transport and Public Works Ministry officials. 
  The Ka-32 marked a new stage in the development and 
manufacturing of helicopters in Russia. This version is used to 
transport cargo in its hold and its outside winch can be used in 
the construction, mounting, and stringing of electricity power 
lines. This helicopter is also useful for ocean oil rigs, 
salvage operations, and to transport sick people. 
  The helicopter that arrived on 3 June has already been sold 
to Peru. This unit may be used in the fight against drug 
trafficking or against the Shining Path organization. The 
Uruguayan Army supplied a crane to help unload the container. 
  This type of helicopter can be assembled in three days.

<F P=106> [Report by Alberto Hughes and Victor Darwin Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] Durazno -- The Herreraism-Wilsonism [Herreraist 
faction-Wilson Ferreira Aldunate faction] faction yesterday 
named Alberto Volonte as its presidential candidate. The 
ceremony was attended by a big crowd which completely filled the 
large installations of the Ernesto de Leon municipal stadium. 
  Volonte announced that on 8 June he will resign as the 
president of the UTE [General Administration of State Electric 
Power and Telephones] board of directors and immediately begin 
to participate in the electoral campaign with his running-mate 
Alvaro Ramos. 
  The crowd exceeded the expectations of the organizers. Many 
said they were witnessing "a phenomenon similar to that observed 
in 1971 [not further specified]." 
  A note was read identifying the faction and explaining the 
reasons behind the choice of Volonte, who was identified as the 
right person to turn their vision of the country into a reality. 
It was said that the UTE president shows he is a "tough 
administrator" who does not "hide his interest in social 
questions and who shows real sensitivity over the problems of 
the people." 
  During his speech, Walter Santoro stressed and recognized 
the 
achievements of the current National Party administration.

  [Text] Small terrorist groups of "Red Sea" battalion 
militants, retreating in disorder after escaping from the 
antisubversive forces following clashes near Monzon, are 
traveling to Ancash where Shining Path [SL] columns still exist 
near Callejon de Conchucos. 
  This conclusion is based on reports to this daily by 
intelligence experts who are evaluating military operation 
"Aries," which was held recently in the Huallaga Front. 
  Analysts stated that SL members, who until a few weeks ago 
camouflaged themselves by exchanging the rifle for the hoe and 
who several times tried to ambush Army patrols, are in Ancash 
after crossing the Jircan and Aranca (Huanuco) jungle. 
  The experts explained that they travel in small groups of 
four to six subversives, looting settlements and forcing 
peasants under death threat to house them in their small cabins 
and to feed them. 
  They said operation "Aries" was 80 percent effective but due 
to the harsh terrain and other factors, an undetermined number 
of terrorists escaped from Huanuco toward the Ancash mountain 
range. 
  They said the subversives may be in Llamellin on their way 
to 
Choccho and Sinachang but their objective is to reach Acobamba 
and the Callejon de Conchucos where there are SL columns who 
repeatedly conceal their weapons and mix with the peasants who 
raise sheep. 
  The analysts said these subversives, like all SL militants, 
ambush their enemy and then hide their weapons and appear to be 
peasants or businessmen who have nothing to do with subversion.

<F P=106> [Interview with former Fujimori cabinet Minister of Economy </F>
Juan Carlos Hurtado by Luis Jaime Cisneros H. and Pilar Davila; 
place and date not given: "With an Eye on 1995?"; first 
paragraph is DEBATE introduction] 
  [Excerpts] Juan Carlos Hurtado Miller (Lima, 1940) is a 
potential candidate for president of the republic in 1995. The 
former prime minister and economy minister in Alberto Fujimori's 
government admits that he might run in the 1995 presidential 
election with or without Fujimori but not against him. Hurtado 
portrays himself as a consensus-builder and acknowledges that 
the nation will need an agreement with the Armed Forces in order 
to ease the critical relations between civilians and the 
military; he also proposes wiping the slate clean to prevent 
revanchism that would jeopardize the country's modernization. 
[passage omitted] 
  [DEBATE] Your term of office as a minister lasted seven 
months. Don't you think this is a short relationship between a 
president and his prime minister? 
  [Hurtado] My job was a very special one. It was my 
responsibility to lay the groundwork for the process of 
stabilization and reincorporation. I had disagreements about 
social development. I wanted to decentralize the municipalities, 
but Fujimori did not. My term of office was very different from 
Bolona's or Camet's; each one of them completed a stage. 
  [DEBATE] Did the government have a pacification strategy 
from 
the beginning? 
  [Hurtado] On the issue of pacification I attended three 
meetings of the Pacification Council that we created. Fujimori 
deserves all of the credit for the gains. 
  [DEBATE] Putting our trust in God at the close of your 
message announcing the "shock therapy" made you "famous".... 
  [Hurtado] The words "God help us" were extremely important. 
Although it may have seemed melodramatic, this was a sincere 
invocation. We did not know how the country was going to react 
to such harsh measures. And we had to create feelings of 
solidarity, unity, and faith in our country's destiny. 
  [DEBATE] What do you see as Fujimori's virtues? 
  [Hurtado] All Peruvians must acknowledge three extraordinary 
virtues in him. He rose to the occasion when he took over as 
president of the republic, bearing in mind that he went from 
running a university to running the country. Fujimori began his 
political career as president of the republic. Second, he was 
able to accept change. He entered a field that was unknown to 
him, economics in particular, and after a landslide election he 
risked his entire political capital overnight and implemented 
change by calling for a harsh program of economic stabilization. 
His third virtue is that he had the courage to head up the 
battle against terrorism. The Armed Forces have always had a 
strategy, but they complained that civilians were neither 
responsible nor determined enough to implement it and end the 
war. 
  [DEBATE] Are you a political sniper for Fujimori? 
  [Hurtado] The description bothers me. I would not take part 
in any electoral movement that might be organized against 
Fujimori, out of loyalty and, moreover, because I find it 
absurd. I think that if Fujimori's popularity declines, the big 
danger in 1995 is that the country will have dozens of 
presidential candidates. 
  [DEBATE] Would you support a neo-Fujimori candidate? 
  [Hurtado] That is a little like continuity within the status 
quo. It is what Fernando Belaunde Terry once said: "We need 
continuity in the government, but not the status quo." Today the 
architect has raised the same banner. Continuity means 
continuing the reforms, stabilization, pacification. What 
worries me about this course of action is that since we are a 
country with unmet needs, fulfilling them may come to be 
identified with one man, one leader. 
  [DEBATE] Do you think that what happened in the case of the 
"Cantuta law" lessens Fujimori's reelection chances? 
  [Hurtado] Yes, but Fujimori is an extremely practical man. 
He 
posits his theorem, sets forth his premise, develops his 
theorem, draws his conclusions, and puts "QED." He does not use 
modern mathematics; he is not a set-theory man. He analyzes the 
La Cantuta theorem as the La Cantuta theorem. The same thing 
will be the case with his reelection. He will consider his 
chances on the basis of the polls the National Intelligence 
System and private firms provide him; he will add and subtract, 
and if he senses that he has no chance, he will not run. Others 
say that he will do whatever he can to win, but I do not think 
that he will commit fraud to get reelected. 
  [DEBATE] Is Decree Law 776 on municipal budgeting a sign of 
a 
government campaign to limit the chances of Fujimori's major 
rivals? 
  [Hurtado] I think that the election campaign will be 
aggressive, but I do not see the municipalities law as a move 
against Ricardo Belmont. The mayor of Lima is wrong there. There 
may be another kind of confrontation with politicians that 
complicates the electoral atmosphere. It is not to the 
opposition's advantage if support for Fujimori weakens; instead, 
it is in their interest for him to remain at a reasonable 30 
percent. If the political parties do not run candidates, their 
tone will be less aggressive towards Fujimori and vice-versa. I 
do not see any new candidates emerging either, besides Perez de 
Cuellar, who I think is the most serious one. Belmont is not the 
right man in terms of training, but he is an alternative, like 
Daniel Estrada and Luis Caceres. 
  [DEBATE] Do you share Belaunde's opinion that Perez de 
Cuellar lacks the heart to wage an election campaign? 
  [Hurtado] If that were true, if he lacked heart, then his 
huge contribution to Peru through his international prestige 
would offset any perceived personal shortcoming. I would not go 
so far as to say that Perez de Cuellar is not a good 
presidential candidate. We do not know Javier as a politician; 
we know him in the international arena, where he did an 
excellent job. Let's wait and see. 
  [DEBATE] You are speaking as though you were a potential 
pro-Fujimori presidential candidate.... 
  [Hurtado] People say that because I have been a politician 
and have worked with Fujimori. But what kind of political 
support could I get? 
  [DEBATE] You seem to be assessing it.... 
  [Hurtado] Look, someone has to put the idea in your head or 
nominate you as part of a presidential ticket. 
  [DEBATE] Would you accept a neo-Fujimori presidential 
nomination? 
  [Hurtado] I do not know. I have worked for 17 years in the 
public sector. I could do it five more years with or without 
Fujimori but not against Fujimori. 
  [DEBATE] How long has it been since you spoke with Fujimori? 
  [Hurtado] Two years, when he was kind enough to nominate me 
as a candidate for director general of the UN Food and 
Agriculture Organization. 
  [DEBATE] Do you think that Fujimori ought to run again? 
  [Hurtado] He should not because he will find it hard to free 
himself from his presidential duties and use all of the 
resources of the State. I do not think that he should be 
reelected. One reason is that the makeup of the next Congress is 
going to be very heterogeneous. How is Fujimori going to govern 
in 1995 if he is rejected by the political parties? In a 
Congress that is one-third pro-Fujimori, one-third political 
parties, and one-third independents, the two latter groups will 
likely join sides against Fujimori. So there could be another 
coup. This is why a consensus-building president is needed. In 
this connection, Perez de Cuellar could very easily carry on 
talks with the opposition to implement a minimal program. 
  [DEBATE] If we assume that the Armed Forces have a 
long-range 
agenda, beyond Fujimori, how can they be depoliticized? 
  [Hurtado] All of the candidates in 1995 will be under the 
Armed Forces' magnifying glass. I do not think that the military 
has an agenda; rather, they are committed to a program to move 
the country forward. An annoying but valid comparison is being 
made with what the Pinochet government represented in Chile, 
which with all of its defects put the country on the road to 
development. In contrast, the disaster began in Peru in 1968. I 
think that the Armed Forces are committed to an institutional 
agenda for the country's development rather than to the 
political manipulation or control of top echelons. So, the 1995 
candidates will necessarily have to be close to the Armed Forces. 
  [DEBATE] Will the transparency of the electoral process be 
in 
danger if a candidate who does not have the approval of the 
Armed Forces is elected? 
  [Hurtado] A good candidate has to talk with the military; 
that is a national necessity. The transition from pacification 
to democratization in the country has to involve the Armed 
Forces. 
  [DEBATE] The election will be between a pro-Fujimori 
candidate and a neo-Fujimori candidate.... 
  [Hurtado] If Fujimori is not a candidate, I do not think 
that 
the option of the designated successor will work. It has already 
been shown that the president does not have the ability to 
endorse anyone. 
  [DEBATE] What would you propose to do with the 1993 
Constitution that Fujimori pushed? 
  [Hurtado] I would amend some of its basic articles. 
  [DEBATE] Do you think that the educational reform that the 
government will begin this year is constructive? 
  [Hurtado] Privileges in education have grown stronger in 
recent years, but I see no reform. I see only school 
construction. If Foncodes [National Compensation and Social 
Development Fund] does not have a program to protect pregnant 
mothers and children from birth to age five, then of what use is 
a reform? The social-development programs of Bolivia, Chile, and 
Colombia emphasize development between those ages because that 
is when brain capacity develops. This government's major 
shortcoming right now is its lack of vision in social 
development. I do not know whether the government has basic 
knowledge about social development. It may know something about 
the proper management of funds and organization. But by and 
large it has not outlined a program, its connection with 
social-development planning, and the complementary and 
substantive reforms such as decentralization. 
  [DEBATE] What items should be on a presidential agenda for 
the 1995-2000 period? 
  [Hurtado] Resolving the civilian-military and 
civilian-civilian relationships. Fujimori could do the first 
part well, but has had too many confrontations with civilians. 
So, what we need is a consensus-building president, and to 
forget about revanchism. Differences have to be narrowed, not 
widened. Peru needs solidarity, unity, and hard work by all. 
  [DEBATE] A clean slate? 
  [Hurtado] The only ones with whom I would not do that are 
the 
terrorists and the people who get rich through government. 
  [DEBATE] What items should be on a national government 
agenda? 
  [Hurtado] In my opinion, the next government has four basic 
tasks, and I think that Fujimori ought to bring them up right 
now. First, move from stabilization to development. Second, move 
from pacification to democratization. Third, move from 
reincorporation to integration. And finally, move from social 
development to the creation of productive jobs and inward 
integration by creating a grass-roots economy that brings the 
informal sector into the economic mainstream. 
  [DEBATE] Would you be Perez de Cuellar's running mate? 
  [Hurtado] That would be a great honor because I have great 
respect and personal admiration for him. 
  [DEBATE] What has been your most gratifying moment in 
politics? 
  [Hurtado] When I was sworn in as minister of agriculture on 
4 
September 1983, and my father was still alive but mentally and 
physically impaired. Nonetheless, I showed him the ministerial 
sash before I took the oath, and he smiled at me. I then 
inferred what he would have liked me to do and went to Dr. 
Bustamante y Rivero's home; I spent a long time talking with him 
about what a ministerial post means. It is a moment that I 
recall with the greatest satisfaction. I would have liked for my 
father to be there. 
  [DEBATE] And your most unpleasant moment? 
  [Hurtado] From 5 to 8 August 1990, when we became convinced 
that there was no choice but to implement a harsh stabilization 
program. We looked at the poverty figures and were dismayed 
about the impact that it was going to have on the poorest of the 
poor. Those were the most difficult and distressing moments of 
my political career. 
  [DEBATE] Do you admire any Peruvian politician? 
  [Hurtado] I have admired Bustamante since I was a child for 
his political integrity. As for the ones with whom I have had 
daily contact, there is Belaunde, who developed a very profound 
doctrine in Peru and who showed me new horizons for development 
that the university never did; Bedoya, because of his political 
drive and well defined personality; and Fujimori, for the 
aforementioned virtues.

  [Text] Lima, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Research carried out by 
polling enterprises shows that the Peruvian presidential 
candidate with the best chance of winning the 1995 elections is 
one who is independent and able to solve the unemployment 
problem, the economic crisis, and the hunger problem. 
  Here are the issues that currently worry Peruvian's the 
most: 
unemployment (31.4 percent), the economic crisis (21.7 percent), 
terrorism (18.1 percent), low salaries (6.6 percent), hunger 
(5.9 percent), education (4.4 percent), drug trafficking (4.2 
percent), and corruption (3.6 percent). 
  The poll conducted by the Imasen enterprise reveals that 
former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's chances 
have dropped to 28.3 percent while current President Alberto 
Fujimori enjoys the support of 39.8 percent. 
  Perez de Cuellar's popularity probably dropped due to his 
delay in deciding whether or not to run in the April 1995 
elections. 
  If Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar went to a second round, 
Fujimori would obtain 46.8 percent and Perez de Cuellar 40.3 
percent. 
  A survey by Imasen in April showed the electoral preference 
also leaned in Fujimori's favor with 45.6 percent compared to 
43.6 percent for the former UN secretary general. 
  Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, who has just announced his 
candidacy, received 14 percent support while former President 
Fernando Belaunde received only one percent. 
  Belaunde's electoral campaign, which started a few months 
ago, appears the most aggressive. 
  "Authoritarianism must not continue at Government Palace," 
stated Belaunde who said the article of the 1993 Constitution 
that authorizes immediate presidential reelection "is an 
adventure that harms the people of Peru and America." 
  The Datum polling enterprise announced that the candidate 
must establish a real relationship with electors because his 
success or failure relies on a harmony between what he preaches 
and what the people need. 
  Another polling enterprise, CPI [expansion unknown], has 
found the candidates must appear independent and must reconcile 
social aspects with the modernization of the economy. 
  Other enterprises maintain that the discrepancies between 
what candidates promise during campaigns and what happens once 
elected has caused the people to disbelieve in political 
speeches. 
  The Forum enterprise has stated that "nefarious experiences 
of the past mean the people no longer want political speeches, 
rather direct messages, free of superfluous words."

<F P=106> [From the Manuel D'Ornellas' Column: "Playing With Fire"] </F>
  [Text] There is no doubt: Alan Garcia is trying to 
negotiate with Fujimori's government so that based on the 
alleged "ruling," which is just a preliminary report, by the OAS 
Inter-American Human Rights Committee, he would be allowed to 
return to Peru without any risk of prison or trial. 
  This strategy was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera 
and it is obvious to all: First during an interview with the 
U.S. television station CNN, and then with the local RPP [Radio 
Programas del Peru], Garcia extends a bouquet to Fujimori, 
saying he agrees with him, that he recognizes Fujimori's good 
government. 
  The political message is clear: If Alan Garcia gets what he 
wants, he would support Fujimori with his party's vote at the 
forthcoming elections slated for next year. That vote could tip 
the balance in favor of the president and end the virtual tie, 
as demonstrated by the polls between Fujimori and Perez de 
Cuellar, should the latter finally launch his candidacy. 
  Strategists of this rapprochement between the government and 
APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] assume that the 
vote controlled by Alan Garcia would be about 15 percent of 
overall votes, based on the results of the 1990 elections. This 
may be somewhat exaggerated if we consider the latest municipal 
elections where APRA was practically torn to pieces at the 
ballot boxes. Also, nothing guarantees that APRA members will 
blindly follow Alan Garcia's electoral instructions, as happened 
over the order given by Haya de la Torres in 1956 and which led 
Manuel Prado to victory. 
  Meanwhile, the possibility that Alan Garcia might be 
negotiating some sort of a pact with Fujimori is already 
rattling APRA. Agustin Mantilla, who was recently released -- 
was his release an offering to Garcia? -- claims that it is 
impossible to dialogue "with a dictatorship." This position was 
immediately supported by Hugo Otero, a tireless applauder of the 
former president of the Republic (as we see it, the most fearful 
enemy facing the unity of APRA continues to be the former 
president's self-exile). 
  Worst of all, however, is the fact that members of the 
government seem to be flirting with the idea of negotiating with 
Garcia, of bartering his impunity for an electoral endorsement. 
If this is consolidated, it would be an even greater error than 
the clumsy rapprochement attempt with Abimael Guzman, which 
included sending a birthday cake to Iparraguirre, which deprived 
the government of so many votes in the 31 October 1993 
referendum. Any whitewash of Garcia would be Fujimori's ethical 
and political funeral.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 13 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban 
President Fidel Castro denied here today that he will propose 
the possible return of Cuba to the OAS at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. He said he will meet with those 
presidents who wish to do so. 
  Upon his arrival in this northern Colombian city, Castro 
said 
there has been progress in all the Ibero-American summits, but 
he explained that we must wait for the pronouncements by all the 
presidents attending the summit. 
  "We have things to say, but we must wait until tomorrow," 
Castro said in brief statements to the media at the Rafael Nunez 
Airport, in view of their insistence. 
  "We will meet with all those wishing to meet with us," the 
Cuban president said, when asked about possible bilateral 
meetings he might hold during his stay in Cartagena. 
  When questioned about a possible return of Cuba to the OAS, 
Castro said he will not raise the subject in the summit of 
presidents of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal. 
  Cuba was expelled from the OAS in 1962, three years after 
the 
revolution led by Castro. 
  The Cuban president arrived at 2315 (0415 GMT) and was 
greeted at the air terminal by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi 
Sanin and author Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 
  Castro was the last of the 22 chiefs of state and government 
to arrive here. Together with Dominican Vice President Carlos 
Morales Troncoso, they will participate in the summit which 
opens here, tomorrow, Tuesday.

<F P=106> [Speech by Brazilian President Itamar Franco at the opening </F>
ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de 
Indias -- live; in Portuguese] 
  [Text] Messrs. Chiefs of State and Government, Messrs. 
Foreign Ministers, Messrs. Ministers, Mr. Governor of the 
Department of Bolivar, Mr. Mayor of Cartagena, Mr. Commander of 
the Naval Fleet of the Atlantic, Messrs. Lawmakers, Ladies and 
Gentlemen. 
  Messrs. Chiefs of State and Government: We are beginning the 
Ibero-American conference of chiefs of state and government, 
which is in its fourth year of existence, based on our mutual 
appreciation and our common values, which have given rise to 
this conference and which have consolidated it. 
  I was pleased to welcome you in 1993 in the city of 
Salvador, 
where I could see everyone's desires to nurture and enhance the 
affinities that time and history have bequeathed to us. 
Guadalajara, Madrid, Salvador, and Cartagena are stopovers in a 
journey leading to a future of solidaristic interaction, heading 
for peace, prosperity for our peoples, and social justice. 
  Commerce and integration as factors of Ibero-American 
development -- the topics on this Summit's agenda -- are the 
natural consequence of previous debates. Here we will analyze 
the factors that condition commercial and economic development 
in our nations. 
  The fact that everyone (?is familiar) with everyone else's 
course allows debates to be frank and, above all, friendly. 
  In the commercial area, we strive for fair rules and for 
really open markets. 
  We conceive of regional integration as a process that 
supplements trade between the various regions of the earth. We 
agree on the need to couple the efficiency that is essential for 
growth with better living standards for our people. 
  We have a broad consensus at this summit. We are supported 
by 
the agreements that we reached in the past on the pressing need 
for a new agenda for development, which may raise the issue to 
the level of a United Nations priority. 
  Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: In this idyllic and 
centuries-old Cartagena, we are moved by the warm hospitality of 
the Colombian Government and people. 
  Under your competent guidance we will move forward in our 
deliberations, in an innovative and constructive form. 
  Different yet supplemental experiences have led us to 
believe 
in the advantages of integration. 
  The European Union [EU] is a process in an advanced stage of 
implementation that should be carefully studied and analyzed. 
  Latin American and Caribbean countries are developing their 
own development programs with positive results. 
  Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, the 
Central American Common Market, the Caribbean Community, the 
Group of Three, and our most recent proposal, the South American 
Free Trade Area, are dynamic projects for liberalization of 
international trade. 
  We were greatly satisfied to hear the statements by Bolivia 
in Colonia and by Chile in Belem do Para, seeking to join 
Mercosur. These are concrete steps for creation of the South 
American economic area, which we conceive of as an open, rather 
than excluding, area. 
  In this regard, we hail the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, whose evolution we are closely following. We see 
NAFTA as a possible bridge between Ibero-American nations and 
the large markets of the developed countries of the Americas. 
  The dialogue between the Rio Group and the European Union is 
another route for cooperation and integration. Within this 
framework, we found major and encouraging signs of a new and 
more concrete approach from the EU to Latin America, an 
achievement to which the dialogue we held at this forum must 
have certainly contributed. 
  The current international situation offers new opportunities 
for diplomacy. This forum is operating under auspicious 
circumstances, based on our peoples' devotion to democracy and 
on their leaders' commitment to improving it. 
  We represent a community of nations marked by its devotion 
to 
peace. However, the aspirations of (?tranquility) that we share 
coexist with the contrasting image of exclusion and violence. 
  In this regard, the Ibero-American conference has tried to 
contribute to the strengthening of tolerance and harmony. 
Tolerance and harmony should give inspiration to the relations 
between our countries. 
  The isolating policy of sanitary cordons no longer suits the 
pluralistic and dynamic world in which we live. 
  Mr. President Cesar Gaviria: I would like to conclude my 
speech by warmly congratulating you on your election as 
secretary general of the Organization of American States, where 
I am sure you will do a fine job. 
  I wish you success in the task that you have undertaken. I 
am 
now transferring to Your Excellency the direction of the work of 
this Fourth Conference of Ibero-American Chiefs of State and 
Government. Thank you, very much. [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by ``special correspondent'' Elia Semeone from </F>
Belem, Brazil] 
  [Text] On 6 June, Chile urged the Inter-American community 
to focus on honesty on the grounds that corruption is a threat 
to the democratic governments that, for the first time in 
history, are installed in most countries of the hemisphere. 
  Chile also emphasized that economic development and social 
well-being must go hand in hand, and that free trade should be 
promoted through ever-broadening integration mechanisms. 
  Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa made these 
proposals 
on 6 June during his address before the OAS General Assembly. 
  The issue of honesty and its effects on growth and the 
shoring-up of democracy is a new concept within the framework of 
the OAS, a concept that Chile decided to include in the 
organization's agenda this year. 
  Figueroa reiterated Chile's commitment to the Americas and 
said that from its viewpoint any common effort to strengthen 
democracy in the hemisphere is very important. 
  He expressed Chile's utmost interest in the struggle against 
extreme poverty because severe social differences in American 
countries pave the way for political instability, which usually 
weakens democracy and jeopardizes peace in the hemisphere. 
  Figueroa said: "We must realize these urgent needs and the 
subtle threats against democracy in our countries." 
  He said it is necessary to modernize the state, which 
implies 
turning it into an effective and capable manager by staffing it 
with trained, honest, and public service-oriented people. 
  Figueroa emphasized that honesty must be addressed as part 
of 
this quest for the modernization of the state. 
  He quoted Chilean President Eduardo Frei's address to 
Congress on 21 May: "The lack of public ethics is the result of 
an uncontrolled exercise of power, and ambiguous 
responsibilities... Public ethics affect private business and 
public administration alike." 
  The foreign minister stated that society's commitment to 
democracy will undoubtedly be strengthened if administrations 
remain honest, if excessive centralization of power and 
decisionmaking is abolished, and if the required oversight 
mechanisms are established. 
  Among the issues Chile considers in need of priority 
attention from the OAS, Figueroa mentioned the development of 
American people within the framework of free trade, fairness, 
and growing integration. He said the recent amendments to the 
OAS Charter -- which allow the organization, among other things, 
to suspend members for breaches of democratic order -- show once 
again that democracy, development, and peace are closely related. 
  Figueroa stressed: "Our countries must have development 
formulas that ensure fairness. Our economic policies must seek 
sustained growth as a way to guarantee the well-being of all 
social strata." 
  He added that this means all countries of the region must be 
able to freely market their products. He praised the Marrakech 
agreements on free trade, and urged all American governments to 
seek out agile and effective formulas for economic integration. 
  Figueroa reaffirmed that Chile will pursue economic 
cooperation and free trade agreements with other American 
countries, and emphasized his government's decision to seek 
rapprochement with the Common Market of the South. 
  He said: "Regional trade freedom is Chile's topmost priority 
and that is what we work hardest for. We would like to see 
every country in the continent share our desire to implement a 
policy of open regionalism which -- if followed by practical 
agreements -- will fuel our economies and allow us to improve 
the standards of living of our people." 
  Figueroa said the region must take concrete steps toward a 
realistic integration process that is open to the world economy. 
  Figueroa mentioned the hemispheric summit that U.S. 
President 
Bill Clinton has called, saying that Chile warmly supports it. 
  Chile's foreign minister said: "We are convinced that it is 
a 
worthwhile opportunity to thoroughly study burning regional 
issues such as free trade, economic cooperation, and the 
development of our countries. We hope this summit will yield 
concrete results and a clear-cut and feasible plan of action." 
  He conveyed Chile's satisfaction over the OAS 
acknowledgement 
that social issues must be considered in the search to maintain 
peace. 
  Figueroa recalled that the World Summit on Social 
Development 
will take place next year in response to Chile's proposal to the 
United Nations. 
  The Chilean foreign minister addressed the significance of 
cooperation, protection of the environment, and full respect for 
human rights. 
  He underscored the need to maintain peace and security 
within 
a more global concept of the latter, by promoting measures to 
enhance trust. 
  Figueroa said conditions for improving regional security 
have 
improved in recent years. Chile is convinced that among all the 
continents, the Americas probably have the best chance of 
success. 
  He emphasized the steps Chile has taken in this direction, 
like the signing of the Mendoza Commitment to ban chemical and 
biological weapons, which Argentina and Brazil have also signed. 
He mentioned Chile's compliance with all obligations of the 
Tlatelolco Treaty which bans nuclear weapons from Latin America. 
  Figueroa outlined Chile's efforts in the quest for a new 
system capable of eliminating chemical weapons throughout the 
world. 
  He said: "Chile is convinced that efforts in this direction 
must be made prudently, gradually, and realistically by taking 
successive steps rather than by embarking on overly broad and 
pretentious schemes which turn out to be unfeasible in the long 
run." 
  Figueroa stated that current conditions are favorable for 
redesigning hemispheric security. On the one hand this process 
should make hemispheric security a more global concept, while at 
the same time it should encourage all kinds of measures -- be 
they political, diplomatic, military, educational, or cultural 
-- to stimulate trust and security. 
  The foreign minister thanked Joao Clemente Baena Soares for 
his contribution to the OAS as its secretary general for 10 
years, and conveyed Chile's support for the incoming OAS 
secretary general, current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 
who will assume that position in August.

  [Text] Managua, 14 Jun (AFP) -- The Nicaraguan Government 
has endorsed Cuba's returning to the OAS and it rejected the 
U.S.-imposed economic and political embargo against the island, 
acting Foreign Minister Jose Pallais stated at a meeting with 
the international media on Monday evening. 
  Pallais said that "we would be satisfied if Cuba returned" 
to 
the OAS, from which it was expelled almost three decades ago. 
This topic will be considered along with the main agenda of the 
Fourth Ibero-American summit that opened Tuesday in Cartagena de 
Indias, Colombia. 
  The commercial embargo "is unilateral by the United States, 
and we do not believe in such measures," Pallais stated. He 
noted, however, that Cuba has still "not fulfilled the 
prerequisites" to form part of the so-called democratic 
countries, because it has not implemented "economic reforms and 
political openness." 
  During the past decade the regime of Fidel Castro openly 
supported the Sandinists in their war against the Contras, who 
were armed and financed by the United States. 
  Violeta de Chamorro's Government, which replaced the 
Sandinists in 1990, maintains diplomatic relations with Cuba, 
although these relations have been quite reduced compared to 
relations during the Sandinist period.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Alejandro Bolanos Davis] </F>
  [Text] Minister Antonio Lacayo appeared on Carlos Briceno's 
program, "Why Nicaragua Matters to Us." As he is a public figure 
subject to criticism, and as he openly expressed views affecting 
the nation and individuals, I will now express my opinion of his 
behavior. 
  In listening to Minister Lacayo it was obvious that his 
unconscious betrayed him several times. On this occasion I will 
mention only two such moments. 
  In answering a question about the problem of property 
rights, 
Lacayo said that "property belongs to the one who has it" and 
added: "What can be done is confisc...(then he 
corrected himself) compensate..."people who have been unjustly 
affected. Obviously, the truth came out unintentionally: that 
his government is confiscating from many people 
unjustly hurt by the Sandinist regime in favor of the Sandinists. 
  He also mentioned being struck on his "two faces" instead of 
saying his "two cheeks." Here another great truth also escaped 
from him unintentionally: the autocratic face he displays inside 
the government and the face of a democrat that he unsuccessfully 
tries to show in public. 
  In this program we could see what the minister is and what 
he 
is not. We again saw the arrogant and defensive man who 
intellectualizes his contradiction-laden answers. We saw him try 
to justify his mistakes without actually admitting them and 
without expressing any regret. We heard him say there was 
progress when what there is is unemployment and extreme poverty, 
and that the violators of the government program (the 
"reactionaries") were the members of UNO [National Opposition 
Union] and not Lacayo himself. We heard him say that he relies 
more on what people like Jimmy Carter, the "chinos" [not further 
specified], and international bankers say than on what his own 
Nicaraguan compatriots say. He said Violeta Chamorro is in 
charge, but he is the one who makes the decisions, who lives in 
close contact with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation 
Front], and that he makes concessions to the FSLN so 
"governability will be feasible," but this is not a 
co-government. He said he wants democracy, but will be happy to 
keep the totalitarian Sandinist Constitution until 1997, and he 
repeated many other contradictions as well. It is very easy for 
the subconscious to betray a person full of contradictions and 
manipulation. That is what happened to Minister Lacayo on Carlos 
Briceno's program. 
  Antonio Lacayo is trying to construct a false political 
"center" based on erroneous situational ethics. He is trying to 
concoct an agreement between kidnappers and their hostages, 
between executioners and prisoners, between looters and the 
looted, as if nothing had happened. He wants to impose a 
reconciliation with injustice. He wants people to pardon their 
aggressors without the aggressors repenting for their crimes and 
without returning what was stolen. And to top it all, he wants 
the aggressor to retain a license to continue committing crimes. 
  This "center morality" which Lacayo advocates is downright 
immorality. Minister Lacayo cannot be unaware that there are 
basic laws of life or universal principles that operate 
independently of the individual. Everyone has these laws and/or 
principles imprinted on his conscience. This internal voice 
tells us if what we are doing at any given moment is right or 
wrong. 
  The minister should try to listen to the voice of his 
conscience. He will have to pause for a moment so he can 
concentrate on it, and reflect and meditate on what it is saying 
to him. One impediment he might have is the insane level of 
activity that has overwhelmed him, along with his pro-Sandinist 
political and cultural conditioning. These obstacles deaden his 
sensitivity to heed the voice of his conscience and so to 
comprehend how out of step he is with life's basic laws. 
  I congratulate Carlos Briceno for being able to put his 
finger on the sore spot and for his skill as an interviewer.

  [Text] Last night, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro arrived 
in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to attend the fourth 
Ibero-American summit 14-15 June. Fidel arrived in the company 
of Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National 
Assembly of the People's Government, and Foreign Minister 
Roberto Robaina. Fidel was greeted at the foot of the Cubana 
plane by Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin and writer 
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, winner of the Nobel Prize for 
Literature. Colombian Justice Minister Andres Gonzalez and 
Communications Minister William Jaramillo were also present. 
  After reviewing the honor guard and speaking with 
approximately 20 reporters, Fidel said he was very pleased to be 
in Colombia and replied to a question by saying it would be too 
optimistic to hope the U.S. blockade would end during the 
summit. Fidel added that he has several things he wants to say 
but we have to wait until 14 June, when he will address the 
heads of state of the 21 Ibero-American nations. 
  Last night, along the route of the caravan taking Fidel and 
Foreign Minister Sanin to the hotel, numerous people gathered to 
shout support and welcome slogans. Some of the slogans 
displayed along the route of the caravan read: Welcome Fidel! 
With Cuba for all Times!

  [Text] The region continues to remain on standby as it 
awaits word from Prime Minister Erskine Sandiford, of Barbados, 
as to what he proposes to do. A motion of no-confidence was 
passed in Parliament last week against the Barbadian leader, the 
first of its kind in the Caribbean, the humiliating 14-12 vote, 
including that of his ministers from his very own cabinet. 
  It was widely speculated that Prime Minister Sandiford would 
have resigned following this defeat, but the leader, reputed for 
taking his time when it comes to decisionmaking, has, to date, 
not indicated what he intends to do. Sandiford is reported to 
have attacked his opponents and the resolution last week by 
stating, quote, I will use the last ounce of breath that I have 
in my body to deal with that question of the resolution that has 
no basis and no validity in terms of being able to stand up to a 
truthful record of the situation as far as it relates to me, as 
prime minister and as head of the government. I will not rest 
until this is done, end of quote. 
  Sandiford described the outcome of the vote as a miscarriage 
of justice in the political arena, where, he says, an attempt 
could be made to hang, draw, and quarter him on the basis of the 
resolution that, itself, is riddled with lies and untruths.

<F P=106> [Report by Jesus Aranda and David Aponte] </F>
  [Text] In the past six years, the National Defense 
Secretariat [Sedena] has seized 134,881 firearms, including 
rifles and handguns. According to Sedena reports, the total 
number of weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized during the 
first six months of 1994 reached 5,626. 
  Reports indicate that of the total seized, 95 percent 
entered 
Mexican territory through so-called small-scale smuggling, 
especially through Chihuahua, Michoacan, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and 
Nayarit. 
  Meanwhile, Navy Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo 
has said the weapons the Mexican Army and Navy seized belong to 
drug traffickers, "but we have not found caches of weapons or 
anything similar." 
  Interviewed during the inauguration of the 15th Navy Health 
Medical Campaign, Ruano said the drug traffickers have economic 
resources to buy weapons, but "too much propaganda is being 
given to what you call goat horns [AK-47 submachine guns]." 
  [LA JORNADA] In light of these circumstances, which are 
being 
denounced in the United States, isn't it necessary to change 
surveillance measures? 
  [Ruano] There really is no need for that. Wherever weapons 
are being smuggled, it will be stopped. 
  According to Sedena reports, only 5 percent of the weapons 
that enter Mexico are brought in legally. Those weapons are 
given to state governments to supply their police forces, and a 
small portion winds up in the hands of civilians. The cost of 
the weapons varies in accordance with their brand, caliber, 
condition, and use, and prices range from approximately 
300-7,000 pesos 
  Mexican Army figures indicate that during the government of 
President Salinas de Gortari, the Armed Forces seized 54,208 
rifles and 60,673 handguns. In addition, 98,644 weapons, both 
rifles and handguns, that were seized are available to Sedena. 
The report adds that in the first six months of 1994, Sedena 
seized 2,591 rifles and handguns in addition to another 3,035 
that are at the disposal of civilian authorities. The Army 
seized 5,626 weapons during that period. 
  According to Army reports, most of the arsenal comes, 
presumably, from the United States, China, and the former Soviet 
Union. Reports also indicate that the weapons enter the country 
by land, sea, air, and in small amounts; that is, through 
so-called small-scale smuggling. 
  Reports reveal that the federal organizations that receive a 
greater portion of the weapons are in Chihuahua, Michoacan, 
Sinaloa, Jalisco and Nayarit. The weapons presumably enter 
these states mostly by land and in an "organized" manner. 
Meanwhile, Sedena makes, through its General Directorate of 
Factories, weapons under a German trademark exclusively for the 
Mexican Army. 
  Sedena stipulates the requirement that a citizen must meet 
to 
legally buy a weapon. Requirements include that the person live 
honestly, comply with military service, and have no record of 
being sentenced for weapons use. Permits to bear weapons can 
also be obtained based on the nature of the person's occupation, 
the special circumstances of his place of residence, or any 
justifiable reasons that merit it. 
  A document in which the Mexican Army warned the Government 
Secretariat on the possible illegal entry of 20,000 AK-47 
submachine guns, better known as goat horns, was disclosed 
recently. The first shipment would reportedly consist of 2,000 
weapons of this type of (rifles). Later, Sedena stated the entry 
of those weapons, which would represent less than 20 percent of 
the weapons seized in the past six months, into Mexico has not 
been detected so far.

  [Text] Mexico City, 11 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican 
Secretariat of National Defense reported that various national 
institutions are conducting counternarcotics operations this 
rainy season, a time suitable for the planting of drug crops. 
  According to a communique issued by the Secretariat this 
Friday, Mexican troops have conducted operations in Mexico, 
Sinaloa, Durango, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, 
Michoacan, Oaxaca, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Hidalgo, 
Guerrero, Zacatecas, Aguascalientes, San Luis de Potosi, 
Guanajuato, Queretaro, Puebla, and Morelos States. In the 
communique, the Secretariat of Defense indicated that these 
operations were not carried out solely in Guerrero State, where 
local media reported a "massive troop presence." 
  The communique indicated that operations staged in 21 states 
on 1 June resulted in the arrest of 10 local drug traffickers, 
the destruction of 2,242 drug crops, four drug traffickers' 
camps, and a marijuana drier. Officials also incinerated 323 kg 
of marijuana seeds, 30 kg of poppy seeds, and 2 kg of cocaine 
and confiscated 233 firearms and two vehicles. 
  The institution said that in addition to the 
counternarcotics 
operations, authorities will also apply the "Federal Law on 
Weapons and Control of Explosives." 
  The Secretariat added that following the "Regional Operation 
1- 94," conducted from 10 March to 5 April, 22,418 poppy and 
marijuana fields, 6,000 kg of marijuana, and 431 kg of poppy and 
marijuana seeds were destroyed. In addition, 256 firearms and 28 
vehicles were seized. The Secretariat of National Defense 
stated it is continuing its counternarcotics operations.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 13 Jun (NA) -- This week, Economy 
Minister Domingo Cavallo will face a new offensive by the 
governors, who are demanding changes in the system of federal 
income sharing and object to the import of subsidized 
agricultural products and the transfer of provincial pension 
funds to the nation. 
  These issues, which concern ruling party governors as much 
as 
opposition governors, will be analyzed in two meetings in Santa 
Fe and Buenos Aires on 14 and 16 June respectively. 
  Santa Fe will be the location for a meeting of the so-called 
"club of friendly governors," which was born last week when 
Entre Rios Governor Carlos Moine convened a meeting with his 
counterparts at the Constituent Assembly to discuss the national 
economic plan and its repercussions on the regional economies. 
Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann abruptly decided to broaden 
the club's coverage and invited all governors without exception 
to continue discussing their problems. 
  One of the governors' proposals will be difficult for 
Cavallo's team to swallow, as the provincial executive branches 
want all taxes collected in the nation entered into the revenue 
coffer and then want an equitable share of it, that is, 50 
percent for the central administration and 50 percent for the 
provinces. 
  Reutemann trusts that all governors, except Eduardo Angeloz 
of Cordoba, will come to the meeting. Rodolfo Gabrielli 
(Mendoza), Horacio Massaccesi (Rio Negro), Carlos Maestro 
(Chubut), Jose Estabillo (Tierra del Fuego), and Juan Carlos 
Rojas (San Juan) have already confirmed their participation. 
  Besides the above-mentioned revenue sharing percentages, the 
governors of provinces bordering neighboring countries, such as 
Mendoza, Entre Rios, and Rio Negro, among others, continue to be 
concerned about the consequences of imported, subsidized 
agricultural products to local producers. 
  On 16 June, Cavallo will participate in the third meeting 
between national government officials and northern provincial 
governors to try to convince governors of the benefits of 
transferring their pension funds to the nation. 
  During the first meeting, 15 days ago, there was no 
agreement 
despite the efforts of Cavallo, presidential Secretary General 
Eduardo Bauza, and Social Security Secretary Walter Schulthess. 
  The second meeting, held last week, was purely technical. On 
that occasion the provincial economy and finance ministers met 
with Schulthess. The ministers also disagreed with Schulthess, 
and the negative positions started to become official. 
  The provinces of Entre Rios, Formosa, and Misiones have 
already notified the nation that they will not transfer their 
pension funds. According to Schulthess, Cordoba has already 
refused; the five Patagonian provinces, where pension funds so 
far maintain surpluses, will also refuse to transfer their 
pension funds. 
  On 16 June, the central government will use heavy ammunition 
to try to convince the northern provinces' governors. They will 
meet once more with Bauza and Cavallo in the Buenos Aires 
offices of the Federal Investments Council (CFI).

<F P=106> [Report by German Velasquez Clavijo] </F>
  [Text] Three months after the Capitalization Law was 
passed, the process is moving along nicely, according to the 
government. Apparently, judging by reports from the top 
officials of the executive branch, the sectoral laws governing 
the National Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the National 
Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National Smelting 
Enterprise (Enaf), the National Railway Enterprise (Enfe), and 
Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB) are in the process of 
being revised, and investors have shown great interest. 
  The national government set a deadline of 18 months for this 
process to be completed. By the end of that period, state 
enterprises should have been converted into mixed corporations, 
their book value should have been appraised at the financial and 
market levels, regulatory bodies should have been formed, and an 
international call for bids should have been issued for the 
purchase of shares. 
<H5>  Legal Progress </H5>
  The framework law on capitalization has been enacted, but 
the 
legal instrument of the regulatory bodies responsible for 
monitoring the provision of communication, electricity, fuel, 
and transportation services has not been completed yet. 
Moreover, the strategies for obtaining more fresh money have not 
yet been finalized. 
  The sectoral laws for the regulation and organization of 
markets, which will set policy on concessions, authorizations, 
rates, and fees for the five companies, are being analyzed and 
evaluated. The president and his cabinet will be approving them 
any day now, and then they will be sent to Congress. 
  In short, the procedures for carrying out the capitalization 
process have not yet been defined, and therefore it would be 
premature to take a stand on the viability of the process or its 
pros and cons. 
  It is important to know in advance what regulatory 
frameworks 
will govern the different sectors, what criteria will be 
followed for selecting strategic partners, what strategy will be 
followed for each company, and what costs and benefits the 
process will entail. 
  So far, however, the first steps in the process have already 
been taken by the principal executives of the six enterprises to 
be capitalized: Bolivian Government Oil Deposits (YPFB), the 
National Electric Power Enterprise (Ende), the National 
Telecommunications Enterprise (Entel), the Metallurgical 
Enterprise of Vinto (formerly Enaf), the National Railway 
Enterprise (Enfe), and the Lloyd Bolivian Airline (LAB). 
<H5>  YPFB </H5>
  Any day now, the employees of the state petroleum enterprise 
will become the first shareholders in the enterprise, once its 
legal status is officially converted to that of mixed 
corporation. Its bylaws are now being revised. 
  The Hydrocarbon Law is also under consideration. It is 
currently in the hands of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, 
who is expected to approve it and send it on to Congress. 
  According to Capitalization Minister Alfonso Revollo, the 
new 
legal instrument will include a tax system for the hydrocarbons 
sector (an excise tax on gasoline) and other measures aimed at 
attracting investors. 
<H5>  Value Declined </H5>
  Sources say off the record that the value of YPFB has 
dropped 
from $1.5 billion to less than $1 billion. The president of the 
enterprise, Mauricio Gonzales, has urged caution, however, 
noting that it is premature to discuss specific amounts because 
higher offers may be made on the market. 
  It is not known officially what YPFB's book value is; all 
that is available is estimates from recent audits. The final 
results will be released after the consulting firm completes the 
appraisal of assets. 
<H5>  Principal Problem </H5>
  One of the problems that will beset the YPFB capitalization 
process is its heavy debt. The state petroleum enterprise owes 
more than 1.4 billion bolivianos, equivalent to $300 million, 
primarily because of the agreement with Argentina to "start from 
scratch." 
  This situation may be resolved by the replacement of the TGN 
[expansion unknown], but Minister Revollo stated that first the 
macroeconomic impact must be studied, or failing that, 
liabilities must be included in the process. 
<H5>  National Electric Power Enterprise </H5>
  The capitalization of the National Electric Power Enterprise 
(Ende) may allow for the sale of energy to the neighboring 
countries of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, said President Sanchez 
de Lozada. For this reason, an infusion of fresh investment 
funds is necessary. 
  He stated that Bolivia is now the country with the smallest 
electricity production, 700 megawatts. An effort will be made to 
reverse this situation with incentives and foreign investment. 
  To carry out this task, the electricity market must be 
deregulated and Ende must be regarded as just one more company 
competing with others in power generation and distribution. To 
achieve that end, experts at the Energy Secretariat have begun 
to revise the Electricity Code in consultation with experts from 
the World Bank. 
<H5>  Ende Value Unknown </H5>
  The minister of capitalization indicated that no one yet 
knows Ende's book value, but this month the figures will be 
released after an external audit is performed. He explained that 
it is a profitable and well-run enterprise, which makes it more 
attractive on the investment market. 
<H5>  Metallurgical Enterprise of Vinto </H5>
  In the mining sector, capitalization will take place in the 
smelting company of Vinto (formerly Enaf), since this is the 
only company in the sector that is still in production and 
making a profit. That fact will arouse the interest of the 
private sector. 
  This month, company executives will hire a consulting firm 
to 
appraise the firm and evaluate its situation. In addition, all 
the instruments necessary to regulate the process are now being 
drawn up. 
<H5>  Company Value </H5>
  The latest appraisal of the Metallurgical Enterprise of 
Vinto 
indicates that its value is $50 million. This figure may be 
high, however, considering that Minsur [expansion not given] 
invested $17.5 million installing its own smelting plant, with a 
production capacity of 13,000 fine tons of tin, 5,500 tons less 
than that of the national smelting enterprise. 
<H5>  LAB </H5>
  The capitalization of the country's first airline is now 
under way. Top executives are reorganizing and restructuring the 
firm to make it more attractive to the private sector. 
  Analysts say that under current conditions, the company 
could 
only last two more years. Thus, a capital infusion is essential, 
especially considering that it lost $12 million in the last 
fiscal year. 
  Despite these circumstances, LAB executives say the airline 
has great potential for capitalization. Most airlines in the 
world are going through crises, and the Bolivian company is no 
exception. 
<H5>  Entel </H5>
  The government considers the capitalization of Entel of 
vital 
importance, so it has invited a dozen foreign business 
executives representing Korean Telecom, AT&amp;T (of the United 
States), GTE Corporation, France Telecom, Titan Corp., and 
Telefonica de Espana to become familiar with the process and 
with the company's potential. 
  In addition, the Sectoral Law on Communications, the Law on 
Regulatory and Arbitration Bodies, and amendments to the tax 
provisions of Law 843 are now being drafted. 
<H5>  Book Value </H5>
  According to accounting records from previous fiscal years, 
Entel should sell for $141 million to $200 million, but the 
consulting firm will release the official information after 
appraising the company's assets and liabilities. 
<H5>  National Railway Enterprise </H5>
  The National Railway Enterprise (Enfe) has already begun the 
capitalization process in an effort to strengthen the 
transportation system and provide more efficient service to the 
public, in hauling freight, and in import and export activities. 
  It is also in the process of reorganizing its assets and 
liabilities and studying the Railroad Law that will regulate its 
activities with a view to making the railroad company more 
attractive to foreign investors. 
<H5>  Excess Workers a Problem </H5>
  One of the problems that will hinder capitalization is the 
large number of superfluous personnel. In 1985, there were 7,199 
employees, but layoffs have brought that figure down to about 
4,000. 
  This total is not ideal, said Revollo, because the company 
cannot support that many employees. He explained that this 
matter will be negotiated during the capitalization process.

  [Text] Sao Paulo, 13 Jun (AE) -- Presidential candidate 
Luis Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers Party] today said that 
if he is elected president he could allocate 10 percent of the 
federal budget to his jobs program. He did not say how he would 
be able to do this, as most of the budget funds are allocated to 
expenditures contemplated in laws. "The budget funds have not 
been allocated, particularly as the budget has not even been 
approved. This is a shame. It should have been approved in 
December. It is a shame to see that the government has no 
power, not even to approve the budget," he said, changing the 
subject. This morning Lula recorded the program for small 
businessmen linked to Sebrae [Service for Support to Small and 
Micro Firms], which will be broadcast by TV Executive in 28 
auditoriums in the state capitals. 
  According to Lula, it is possible to create the 8 million 
jobs envisioned in his program by channeling to this goal 
resources that are currently "being thrown away." In Lula's 
opinion the federal government has money, and only lacks the 
political will to use it well. According to him, the public 
funds required for the jobs will be withdrawn from funds such as 
the FGTS [Severance Pay Fund] and those contemplated by the 
Constitution, such as official banks and pension funds. Lula 
does not believe that the government has no money for 
investment. "Government officials have little creativity. With 
a little more creativity, resourcefulness, and simplicity there 
would be a possibility to do more with the same money," he said, 
mentioning Ciacs [Integrated Centers for Assistance to 
Children]. "If there are no funds to do things such as Ciacs, I 
will build meeting places and ask the Church and the labor 
unions to lend their facilities for reading and writing classes." 
  Lula discredited the Vox Populi Institute, which reported on 
12 June the results of a poll indicating that support for him 
had decreased from 41 percent to 36 percent. "There are other 
institutes with more credibility. This one used to serve 
Collor, and met with Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB) [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party) on his campaign." Lula attacked the 
PSDB candidate, and said that the economic program had caused 
losses to the workers. He said that even after the new currency 
is implemented the workers will continue without purchasing 
power. He asserted that the PT is not negotiating any agreement 
with former President Jose Sarney and Senator Pedro Simon, both 
from the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. "There is 
no possibility of reaching an agreement with Sarney. That was 
made up," he said. He added that he would like to talk to Simon, 
because he likes him. "But he is participating in the electoral 
campaign of a candidate who is disputing with ours the 
governorship of Rio Grande do Sul State," he said.

  [Excerpt] Santiago, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Acting Chilean Foreign 
Minister Jose Miguel Insulza has stated that "no important 
announcements" will be made in Cartagena following the meetings 
that Chilean President Eduardo Frei will hold with his Cuban 
colleague Fidel Castro and his Bolivian colleague Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada. 
  Insulza thus denied reports in Santiago that Chile and Cuba 
will announce the resumption of diplomatic ties at the end of 
the Ibero-American Summit, which starts today in Cartagena. 
  Regarding Cuba, Insulza said: "It is not in our plans to 
make 
any specific announcement after this meeting (between Frei and 
Castro)." He warned, however, that it is difficult to comment on 
a meeting that will take place in the next couple of days. 
  Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic ties in September 1973 
following the coup d'etat perpetrated by General Augusto 
Pinochet. Ties at the consular level were restored after the 
first Ibero-American Summit that was held in Guadalajara 
(Mexico). 
  Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina is scheduled to make 
an official visit to Chile in August. An announcement on the 
resumption of diplomatic ties has been reportedly postponed 
until then. 
  As for the Bolivian issue, Insulza said nothing has changed. 
He asserted that the Frei-Sanchez de Lozada meeting has "an open 
agenda." He did confirm, however, that Bolivia's landlocked 
issue will be discussed. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Pablo Alfredo Herken Krauer: "The Dark Side"] </F>
  [Text] Paraguay could very well have become a predictable 
and predetermined country. Its economy might have avoided 
becoming one of the poorest and most backward in Latin America, 
and its people might have had a higher standard of living. 
  When lecturers deal with the issue of successful and 
unsuccessful countries at foreign universities, they usually 
teach that the United States did everything possible (and became 
a superpower) with many (resources) at its disposal; Japan did 
everything even though it had practically nothing; and Argentina 
did nothing despite having everything. But what about Paraguay? 
I would suggest that while having many resources it did very 
little indeed. 
  What went wrong? The economic and political systems failed 
as 
did the governments and the people. We were, and are, swindled. 
  The result of this is that in the eyes of many people 
abroad--even though they do not really know us--we are as poor 
as Haiti, as militarized as Cuba (where the government, the 
party, and the Army are part of the one and only "family,") and 
as predetermined as Panama under the wretched General Manuel 
Antonio Noriega. We are seen as very backward in economic 
reforms when compared to Chile, Mexico, Argentina, and Peru over 
achieving a more competitive, modern, and efficient economy. 
  Today, in mid-1994, the year which was forecast to have 
brought an economic "boom" [preceding word in English] and a 
major step forward in our development, very few can guess or 
predict what is in store for Paraguay in the short- and 
medium-term. Who can really say what will happen? 
  Just as there are few who can predict the future, similarly, 
those who can forecast--those who can devise measures to face 
what will happen--do not abound either. 
  What a country! Yet, technically speaking, there are 
positive 
results in the present economic scene even though Paraguayans 
are very cautious, have a deep mistrust of what the government 
says or does, and have no definite outlook for the future. 
  At the beginning of the year it was feared that inflation 
would run at approximately 30 percent. Yet prices have climbed 
much slower and, following the 0.5 percent inflation rate in 
May, we could end the year in a much better position than 
expected. The rate of exchange between the dollar and the 
guarani rose by less than 4 percent in six months. 
  The Central Bank's international monetary reserves have 
increased by 29 percent so far this year and by 40 percent 
compared with May 1993. This is a significant financial sign of 
our guarantee and credit-worthiness to the rest of the world. 
  This is especially so if we recall that in February 1989 we 
did not have--literally speaking--any reserves at all since the 
$233 million then in the Treasury vaults were not enough to 
cover the payment arrears that had accumulated with 
international creditors, which totalled $303 million. Moreover, 
we had to shoulder our $1.885-billion external debt--some 48 
percent of our total annual economic production--which had 
nearly tripled since 1980 due to [former President Alfredo] 
Stroessner's extravagance that has caused us so many headaches. 
  Our international monetary reserves now stand at $898 
million--probably the best level in the last 10 years--with no 
significant arrears with our foreign commitments, with a sizable 
dollar deposit in our banks ($638 million), and with a "reduced" 
foreign debt amounting to just $1.232 billion (representing 17 
percent of the country's production in 1994), the Paraguayan 
economy can afford the luxury of laughing at the critical 
situation confronting many other Latin American countries that 
suffer from their over-indebtedness. 
  The Central Bank's international reserves have increased by 
3,642 percent in real terms since 1988, dollar deposits have 
grown by 349 percent (by 475 percent since February 1989), and 
the external debt has been reduced by 35 percent in the period 
under consideration (by 41 percent since December 1989). 
  Indeed, Paraguay does not have any problems with its 
external 
debt, and the "nice" side of its economy projects a positive and 
attractive image to the world. And yet, we are unfortunately 
seen as a Haiti (a poor and backward country), a Cuba 
(militarized and under the hegemony of the Colorado Party), a 
Panama (drug traffickers), and we trail far behind the leading 
countries in the region. This is why we are neither a 
predictable nor a predetermined country. 
  On closer examination, or by dwelling upon the present 
economic circumstances, the problem of foreseeing what will 
happen and preparing for it becomes even more curious and 
worrisome when we see that since August 1993--when President 
[Juan Carlos] Wasmosy took office--Central Bank international 
reserves have increased by 50 percent, dollar deposits have 
grown by 14 percent, and $273.2 million from Itaipu [in 
royalties] has entered the country. 
  If this were not enough, the distinctive trait of the policy 
of the finance minister and his team is that of a more balanced 
budget management. They have at their disposal 50 percent more 
financial resources than last year--some $544 million--and have 
spent approximately $387 million, thus yielding a 41-percent 
surplus. 
  On one hand, income tax collection has increased by 68 
percent, revenues from value added tax and customs duties have 
grown by 36 percent and 32 percent respectively, and royalties 
from Itaipu have tripled. On the other hand, social expenditures 
(education, health care, and housing) have edged up by 40 
percent. 
  Notwithstanding this, Paraguayans are cautious and 
distrustful, they are neither satisfied with nor reassured by 
the performance of the administration, and the outlook is 
uncertain. Why? 
  Some colleagues would argue, quite rightly, that the "harsh" 
or gloomy side of our difficulties should come before the 
"bright" side of the economy. To spell it out; cotton 
production will drop by 20 percent, there is no "boom" in 
soybean production, economic activity is either stagnant or near 
a standstill, credits that are in the process of being collected 
have increased by 67 percent (from May 1993 to May 1994), one 
can hardly make ends meet, and many people are barely eking out 
a meager existence or are even slipping. 
  This is true, but regardless of the harsh economic 
reality--and going beyond the positive results--the dark side of 
the economy does not explain the spectacle of a country which, 
instead of being predictable and predetermined, looks more like 
a boat adrift. 
  It is my considered opinion that the problem is presently 
more political than economic. Proof? 1) A government that did 
not start as expected and desired; 2) A president who does not 
convince and seems to be ensnared; 3) A military chief--General 
Lino Cesar Oviedo--who went from being the hero in the 
democratization film to being the chief bad guy, providing an 
additional example of how we cheat each other; 4) The crazy 
internal struggle by Colorado Party factions, which smells of a 
foul and irresponsible plot to undermine Wasmosy's 
administration; 5) Political chicanery and jingoism in general 
that characterizes the performance of the ruling party and of 
the opposition, like the case of 23 pitiful senators who tried 
to deal a "coup de grace" to the privatization of some 
state-owned companies. 
  This all leads me to conclude that the dark side of politics 
is more prejudicial than its economic counterpart. 
  From this viewpoint, one should be grateful for the present 
performance of the economy. Nevertheless, we could be in a much 
better situation and Paraguay could have become a predictable 
and predetermined country. 
  If the Wasmosy administration had been more concerned about 
the nation than about the party, if the ANR [the National 
Republican Association-Colorado Party] had been less of a 
troglodyte, if Congress had been more concerned about bills, if 
politicians had been more coherent, and if Gen. Oviedo had been 
sent into retirement, then the state of affairs in 1994 would 
have been very different and the positive results of the 
"bright" side of the economy would have really been instrumental 
in expediting and deepening change. 
  Although hard to believe, if Gen. Oviedo had been retired, 
Paraguay would now be a credible, predictable, and predetermined 
country. It would have been easier to give up being another 
Haiti, Cuba, or a future Panama, and the world would know us 
better. 
  We could be in a better situation; we should be in a better 
situation. Despite all its resources, Paraguay has done very 
little. We have been cheated and we have allowed it to happen. 
Cowards die several times; heroes die only once.

  [Text] Caracas, 14 Jun (AFP) -- According to similar 
reports issued in Caracas today, seven Venezuelan commercial 
banks closed their doors today "until further notice" following 
a decision by the Central Bank of Venezuela to exclude them from 
clearinghouse activities. 
  Although the source did not deny nor confirm the news to 
AFP, 
its reporters were able to confirm that the Construccion, 
Barinas, Maracaibo, La Guaira, Metropolitano, Bancor, 
Hipotecario de Occidente banks and the Sociedad Financiera 
Fiveca remained closed today. Despite the fact that the banks 
were closed, their employees were working while hundreds of 
customers protested at the doors. 
  These seven banks and Latino Bank -- the country's second 
largest bank, in which the government intervened in January and 
which reopened in April with losses of $5 billion -- have 
received financial assistance amounting to $4.300 billion since 
February to prevent their collapse.

  [Text] Santiago del Estero -- A group of nearly 50 
provincial pensioners have been peacefully evicted by Infantry 
Guards from the Social Security Institute. The pensioners 
entered the premises early in the morning. Then they urged the 
administrative personnel to drop what they were doing and join 
their protest against the possible transfer of the institute to 
the nation. 
  Interior Security Secretary Brigadier Andres Antonietti and 
Police Chief Superintendent General Omar Abdala, who came to the 
institute to learn what was going on, ordered the police to 
evict the protesting pensioners, who left without resistance but 
did shout, chant, and hurl insults. 
  The federal trustee, meanwhile, has been broadcasting a 
public message stating that the provincial pension fund is 
running a deficit of 5 million pesos per month. 
  The message says the government could order the construction 
of many infrastructure projects in one year with that money. 
The message also says pensioners will not have their acquired 
rights trimmed if the service is transferred to the nation. 
<H5>  Resignation in Catamarca </H5>
  Catamarca (TELAM) -- Yesterday, Governor Arnoldo Castillo 
said Economy Ministry Aldo Nieva resigned because of the 
provincial decision to transfer the social security system to 
the nation. Nieva was at his post for only 60 days, but from 
the very first he opposed the transfer of the Social Security 
Institute to the nation. 
<H5>  Alert in Entre Rios </H5>
  Parana (TELAM) -- The Entre Rios Civil Servants Association 
(ATE) has declared a state of maximum alert given the possible 
provincial decision to transfer the local pension fund to the 
nation. The union issued a communique saying that in view of 
"the imminent risk of the transfer of our pension fund, it is 
necessary to immediately coordinate resistance actions with 
pensioner associations and sister organizations." 
  Provincial Governor Mario Moine said "for the time being, we 
have not made a decision to transfer" the pension fund. 
Pensioner associations, however, have demanded a clear 
definition of the funds' future. 
<H5>  Cordoba Opposed </H5>
  Cordoba -- Economy Ministry Jorge Caminotti said "the 
province is not thinking of surrendering its pension fund" 
despite pressure from the national government to transfer. 
  He said the nation has promised to respect pensioners' 
acquired rights if the fund is transferred, but it has not made 
any promises about people who will retire from now on. 
  Caminotti said "for us, the point is not negotiable. This is 
because in Cordoba, legal contributions and retentions have 
always been correctly paid. We take into account the entire 
salary, and not just half of it, as is customary in other 
jurisdictions." 
  Caminotti added: "This means we are not ready to put people 
who have made sacrifices for many years on an equal level with 
people who have not fulfilled their obligations." 
  Caminotti recalled that when the province told the nation 
about the need to have different treatment for new pensioners, 
"the national government harshly rejected our proposal. For us, 
the transfer involves a very important injustice, which we are 
not ready to accept."

  [Text] A poll conducted by Vox Populi between 4 and 7 June 
is published exclusively by JORNAL DO BRASIL. It indicates that 
compared to the poll conducted in May, support for Workers Party 
candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has dropped by 5 points. 
His support dropped from 41 percent to 36 percent, but the 
votes lost by Lula have not been absorbed by any of his main 
rivals. Support for Fernando Henrique Cardoso, of the Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party, remains at 17 percent and he continues 
in second place. Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel 
Brizola still holds third place and is supported by 7 percent of 
the voters. Those who will annul their votes or who still do 
not know for whom they will vote total 29 percent. The poll 
also indicates that President Itamar Franco's support for 
Cardoso is important and that strikes staged by the Sole Workers 
Center harm Lula's image.

  [Text] The first round of a survey conducted by the Vox 
Populi Institute in 10 Brazilian states, which was published 
exclusively by JORNAL DO BRASIL, shows that Brazilian voters 
have not yet linked their preference for president and governors 
in terms of the coalitions formed for this election. In nine 
states and in the federal district -- which all told account for 
76.31 percent of the total number of voters -- the preference 
shown for local gubernatorial candidates has not been translated 
into preference for the respective presidential candidate. 
  The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] is the 
front-runner in three states (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and 
Ceara); the Popular Party [PP] is leading in one state (Minas 
Gerais) and it is sharing the lead in another (Parana) with PDT 
[Democratic Labor Party] candidate Jaime Lerner. The PMDB 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] continues to lead in Rio 
Grande do Sul; the PMN [National Mobilization Party] in Bahia 
State; the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party] in Pernambuco; and 
the PPR [Popular Renewal Party] in Santa Catarina. The survey 
shows that Senator Mario Covas, the PSDB candidate for governor 
of Sao Paulo State, has the highest voters' preference in the 
country -- 59 percent -- but only 14 percent of them are 
confirmed votes. Miguel Arraes (PSB) has obtained 40 percent of 
the confirmed votes in Pernambuco and emerges as the only 
candidate who could win the election in the first round. 
  In Sao Paulo, Mario Covas [PSDB] leads with 59 percent; 
  In Santa Catarina, Angela Amin [PPR] leads with 31 percent; 
  In Rio de Janeiro, Marcelo Alencar [PSDB] leads with 30 
percent; 
  In Rio Grande do Sul, Antonio Britto [PMDB] leads with 52 
percent; 
  In Parana, Alvaro Dias [PP] and Jaime Lerner [PDT] share 
the lead with 41 percent; 
  In Minas Gerais, Helio Costa [PP] leads with 39 percent; 
  In Ceara, Tasso Jereissati [PSDB] leads with 50 percent; 
  In Bahia, Joao Durval [PMN] leads with 29 percent; 
  In Pernambuco, Miguel Arraes [PSB] leads with 56 percent; 
and 
  In the federal district, Valmir Campeao leads with 30 
percent.

  [Text] Almost half of the 9 million destitute Brazilian 
families live in the northeastern region: 48.67 percent of the 
region's inhabitants make hardly enough money to buy basic 
foodstuffs. These figures were released by the IBGE [Brazilian 
Institute of Geography and Statistics]. A diagram of Brazilian 
poverty levels and concentration prepared by the IBGE will be 
exhibited at the entrance hall of the Petrobras [Brazilian 
Petroleum Corporation] building until 10 June. The IBGE has 
also verified that misery exists everywhere in the country. The 
most developed Brazilian region -- the southeast -- has the 
second largest number of destitute people in the country, with a 
total of 2.6 million destitute families, i.e., almost 29 percent 
of the overall number. 
  According to IBGE, there is great social imbalance in the 
southeast region. The highest levels of poverty in this region 
are concentrated in the states of Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, 
and Rio de Janeiro, while the lowest levels are in Sao Paulo 
State. In absolute figures, however, the largest number of 
shantytowns in the country are located in Sao Paulo State -- 594 
-- but only 6.8 percent of the state's population live in them. 
  Recife, Pernambuco State, is the great champion in this sad 
race. Almost half of its inhabitants -- 48.8 percent -- live in 
shantytowns. Among the state capitals, Salvador has the lowest 
number of inhabitants living in shantytowns: only 4 percent. 
Twenty-five percent of the northeastern region destitute, or 1.2 
million poor people, however, live in Bahia State. In Rio de 
Janeiro County, for example, 16.5 percent of the inhabitants are 
destitute. In Rio de Janeiro State, however, there are 661 
shantytowns. In Minas Gerais State, the city with the largest 
number of destitute people is not Belo Horizonte but Betim, 
where 15.5 percent of the people live in shantytowns. 
  According to Dora Hees, an IBGE geographer, the figures for 
the southern region have surprised IBGE experts: 14 percent of 
the overall destitute people in the country live in the region, 
most of them in the states of Parana and Rio Grande do Sul. 
Hees said: "The southern region has been revealing unexpected 
poverty conditions." She explained that the land distribution 
and modernization of agricultural production have been 
contributing to expelling the people from the countryside. 
  Surprisingly, the IBGE figures show that the urban zones of 
the northern region have the best standard of living in the 
country. The largest number of destitute families in the region 
-- 39,638 -- live in Belem, Para State. Six and one-half 
percent of the Brazilian poor live in the central-western 
region, most of them -- 55,610 families -- in the Federal 
District.

  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 9 
June. 
  The inflation rate calculated by the Economic Research 
Institute Foundation, Fipe, indicates a 1.12 percent drop 
compared to the April rate. The most accentuated drop was in 
the price of foodstuffs, which increased 44.4 percent in April 
and only 37.59 percent in May. The price of beef increased 22 
percent, well below the level of inflation, while the price of 
beans decreased 8 percent. The May Average General Price Index, 
IGP-M, measured by the Getulio Vargas Foundation, totalled 42.58 
percent and was lower than expected. (Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO 
BRASIL in Portuguese 7 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Science and Technology Minister Israel Vargas has reported 
that President Itamar Franco authorized an amendment to the 
budget allowing the allocation of $120 million of privatization 
resources to science and technology projects. He said that in 
addition to 30 percent of all Bank of Brazil Foundation 
resources, the $300 million in loans granted by the 
Inter-American Development Bank will also be assigned to the 
sector -- $200 million to finance scientific and technological 
development projects at Brazilian private companies, and $100 
million to the official research organizations. (Rio de Janeiro 
JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 2 Jun 94 p 8)

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro said here today that the time has come to demand 
that the United States abide by the UN resolutions condemning 
the U.S. blockade imposed on that Caribbean island. 
  He also demanded a withdrawal from the Navy Base at 
Guantanamo, Cuba, from the Panama Canal, and other Latin 
American countries in his speech before the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit meeting here. 
  The Cuban leader referred to the so-called hemispheric event 
scheduled by the U.S. Government in Miami in December, and he 
said it would provide an opportunity to demand an end to the 
"criminal and unfair blockade against Cuba." 
  After referring to the summit agenda, he said that if those 
topics are discussed, "Cuba wishes them success," but he noted 
that everything could boil down to "an attempt to establish a 
course in the hemisphere to isolate Cuba; to take control of 
markets in Latin America and the Caribbean; and to check Europe, 
Japan, and the rest of the world." 
  In that case, he added, one would have to paraphrase Jose 
Marti, a Cuban national hero, when a similar event was held in 
Washington 105 years ago: "The time has come for Spanish 
America to declare its second independence."

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President 
Fidel Castro met with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez 
here today at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The Cuban 
president arrived for the meeting at 0700 dressed in civilian 
clothes. He wore a white long-sleeved guayabera shirt, which is 
Cuba's typical dress. 
  The revolutionary leader's appearance in public without his 
classic olive drab uniform, which he has worn since the struggle 
in the Sierra Maestra mountains, caused a veritable commotion 
among the virtually 1,000 reporters covering the conference. It 
was undoubtedly one of the most important news stories of the 
summit's opening day. 
  After meeting with Felipe Gonzalez, the Cuban president left 
for the summit, which was to begin with the participation of 22 
heads of state and government of Latin America, Spain, and 
Portugal, in addition to the vice president of the Dominican 
Republic. 
  PRENSA LATINA learned during a conversation today with Cuban 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina that President Fidel Castro 
will participate in the entire program of the summit and will 
also hold bilateral talks with other presidents and 
personalities. 
  This confirmed that Castro will meet with Chilean President 
Eduardo Frei on 16 June and that Castro is arranging meetings 
with five other chiefs of state. There is also a possibility 
that he will meet with businessmen, congressmen, and 
representatives of organizations that have expressed solidarity 
with Cuba.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- In addition to 
attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Cuban President 
Fidel Castro has conducted an intense program of bilateral 
meetings that surpasses those of previous summits. 
  PRENSA LATINA has learned that the Cuban president met with 
the leaders of Spain, Mexico, Colombia, and Honduras. For Cuba, 
these meetings have been useful and appropriate. 
  The situation in Cuba and in other countries, as well as the 
contents and purpose of the Ibero-American summits, were the 
topics that prevailed during these meetings. 
  It was learned that the Cuban president and his Honduran 
counterpart, Roberto Reina, met early this morning and that the 
meeting was very good. Cuba and Honduras broke diplomatic 
relations in 1961 and since then only some sports and commercial 
exchanges, as well as exchanges at the parliamentary level, have 
been conducted. 
  The leader of the Cuban Revolution, the center of attention 
during this summit, also met with Paraguayan President Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro announced here today that 
the Central American nations have granted her country most 
favored nation status, according to the agreements reached this 
past weekend. 
  The decision was reached during a meeting between the 
Central 
American presidents, just hours before leaving together for this 
Colombian City, to attend the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The 
Nicaraguan leader did not disclose the details of the agreement. 
  In her speech before the 21 other participating leaders, 
Violeta Barrios fiercely defended the privatization process, 
while downplaying the poverty situation in Latin America, 
particularly in Nicaragua. 
  In an address tainted by many diction errors and mistaken 
names and places, the leader used the better part of the seven 
minutes granted to each president, to overestimate the 
Nicaraguan democratic situation.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina denied today his country feels 
disappointed by the development of the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit taking place in this Colombian Caribbean city. 
  When questioned by the press on the lack of a statement at 
the important meeting on the U.S. blockade against his country, 
Robaina replied: "We have no reason to feel disappointed, and 
our conversations regarding this have continued progressing." 
  The chief of Cuban diplomacy was approached by PRENSA LATINA 
reporters and two other media representatives at the conclusion 
of the official photo session of the 21 Ibero-American nations' 
foreign ministers, before the initiation of the second and last 
session of the summit.

<F P=106> [By Juan Carlos Alfonso] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina today defended his country's right to 
present its viewpoints and opinions within the pluralist 
context, which should distinguish the discussions among the 
Ibero-American leaders. 
  During a news conference with Cuban reporters, the minister 
said the island has its own opinion on issues such as democracy 
and human rights, saying: "If these issues are to be discussed, 
my country has plenty to say." 
  Robaina said "the important thing is the possibility of 
having opinions and points of view on issues that can lead to 
discussions; in this way we would be taking advantage of the 
Colombian Government's suggestion to turn the working sessions 
into true debates, not just be limited to previously prepared 
statements brought from outside." 
  Robaina affirmed the Cuban delegation has received dozens of 
messages congratulating it for the way the chief of the Cuban 
revolution "took the bull by the horns" in his speech late 
yesterday. In his address, Fidel Castro thanked Brazilian 
President Itamar Franco for broaching the issue of the U.S. 
blockade against the island. 
  The chief of Cuba's diplomacy said "Cuba did not come to 
Cartagena to hear a unanimous acceptance of our opinions but, 
rather, to have them included in the process of analysis as 
well. We have the right and the experience to express our 
opinion." 
  The monotony of the meetings was broken when Cuban President 
Fidel Castro cited the issue of the U.S. blockade against his 
country, which the United Nations has condemned. 
  The Cuban leader's participation created great expectation, 
as it is expected this issue, and several others the island's 
delegation presented, will be discussed during the last portion 
of the presidents' session, which continues behind closed doors.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 11 Jun (PL) -- Cuba hopes to 
host the Ninth Ibero-American Summit, which will be held in 
1999, Cuban Deputy Foreign Minister Jorge Bolanos announced here 
today. He added that a formal request has already been filed. 
  The deputy foreign minister told Cuban journalists that the 
final decision will be made by the presidents of Mexico, Spain, 
Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, members of the Coordinating 
Committee of the fourth summit, scheduled to be held in this 
city resort next week. 
  Argentina will organize the next summit. The candidates for 
subsequent summits are: Chile in 1996, El Salvador in 1997, 
Portugal in 1998, and Panama in 2000. Bolanos heads the Cuban 
delegation to the meeting of experts that will hold sessions 
until tomorrow to review the final draft document that will be 
approved by the presidents of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal 
on 14 and 15 June. 
  According to reports, the draft document has undergone a 
series of modifications, the one that currently exists is the 
sixth version of the original, and there is a possibility that 
another version may emerge before it is submitted to the heads 
of state or government. According to the official program, the 
heads of state will have seven minutes for their speeches before 
the plenum. They will subsequently discuss behind closed doors 
three topics related to trade and integration. 
  The topics that were selected for discussion are related to 
the new multilateral trade system, the convergence of regional 
integration systems, and competitiveness and social development. 
Colombia proposed that the topics be presented by an equal 
number of presidents, but the idea was discarded because the 
countries could not reach an agreement as to who would make the 
proposals, a diplomat with access to the organizing committee 
told PRENSA LATINA. 
  The method that will be used will be that of an open 
discussion without an introduction, and at the conclusion of the 
debates a brief document will be approved summarizing the 
results of the presidents' discussion, the source added.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 10 Jun (PL) -- Pedro Margolles 
Villanueva, president of PRENSA LATINA, spoke here today in 
favor of regional information systems and agencies and in 
defense of Ibero-American identity and integration. 
  The Cuban official participated in the seminar called "The 
Media and the Development of the Ibero-American Community," 
which concludes today. 
  To back his statement, he cited the example of the "Accion 
de 
Sistemas Informativos Nacionales (ASIN), the Caribbean News 
Agency (CANA), the Central American News Agency (ACAN), the pool 
of agencies of the Nonaligned Movement, PRENSA LATINA, and 
NOTIMEX, among others. 
  He also proposed the adoption of government policies to 
enable the survival of the identity and the culture of the 
region through mechanisms that can explain the realities of the 
region with its own multiple viewpoints. 
  Margolles suggested the drafting of technical, economic, and 
professional cooperation projects to organize a regional 
movement of alternative journalism to compete with the great 
information media. 
  Moreover, he asked media editors of Latin America, Spain, 
and 
Portugal to allow for greater participation of regional 
information systems and agencies in their media. 
  As for the costs of production, he spoke in favor of 
agreements to reduce communication rates and he called for the 
abandoning of prejudicial practices for the achievement of his 
proposed objectives.

here today that Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, Commerce 
Secretary Jaime Serra Puche, and Fisheries Secretary Guillermo

explore new actions to strengthen them. 
  Another topic that is not excluded from the talks at the

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (PL) -- Today, official sources 
reported that the Chamber of Deputies expressed its support here 
for any initiative to lift the U.S. blockade of Cuba. 
  Referring to relations between Cuba and Washington, the 
legislature released a communique on Tuesday stating that 
differences "are not solved by unilateral and interventionist 
means." 
  Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Deputy Fernando 
Charleston read a statement stressing that the blockade of Cuba 
is a violation of essential principles of international law, 
especially nonintervention. 
  Charleston also confirmed that the document issued by the 
Chamber of Deputies expresses solidarity with the Cuban people 
in defense of their sovereignty and self-determination. 
  A state's decision to establish commercial ties with another 
state, the deputy added, is an expression of its sovereignty and 
should not be subordinated to the will of a foreign government. 
For Mexico, nonintervention in the domestic affairs of another 
nation and respect for ideologies are aspects that should rule 
their relations, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Luis Beauregard, also of the PRI, announced that 
the statement approved on Tuesday by the Chamber of Deputies 
will be sent to governments friendly with Mexico as well as to 
those nations that are currently discussing an end to the 
commercial blockade of that island.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina described Mexican President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, one day before the 
initiation of the Fourth Ibero-American Presidential Summit, as 
very successful. 
  Upon his arrival in this city, which has close similarities 
to Havana, Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' visit had 
shown the Cubans' and Mexicans'-- especially their governments' 
-- capacity and will to increase bilateral ties. 
  He considered it especially significant that the Aztec 
country had respected the path taken by the island to initiate 
its economic changes and had not allowed Cuba to be left alone 
in these moments. 
  His stay in Havana, Robaina added, was very intense and 
provided the Cuban delegation to the fourth summit a head start 
in the collateral bilateral relations program and the 
celebration itself. 
  The Cuban foreign minister believes the activity of the 
Mexican leader in Havana furthered practical steps to be taken 
in a new situation for both countries. During his stay, 
important agreements were signed and still others are in a 
process of negotiations. 
  In this sense, he considered the signing of the agreements 
as 
very important, especially the agreement on the telephone 
system. Agreements in other sectors, such as in the cement, 
textile, tile, and sanitary furniture manufacturing industries, 
had also been advanced. Finally, he recalled that both leaders 
had valued their encounter as being courageous, deep, fruitful, 
and extremely friendly. 
  Robaina is a member of the official Cuban delegation to the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit, headed by President Fidel Castro. 
The Cuban president was received here by an enthusiastic 
solidarity group which awaited, since very early today, his 
arrival close to the Hilton Hotel, where the presidents have 
been staying.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- Cuba has called the forceful 
entry by a group of 20 people into the German Embassy in this 
capital early this morning as an obvious provocation. 
  Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has 
confirmed 
to PRENSA LATINA the illegal entry of 17 men and 3 women into 
the German Embassy by crashing a truck with Camaguey Province 
license plates into the iron gate of the embassy's garage. 
  Shortly after this incident, German Ambassador Georg Trefftz 
reported the incident to Cuban authorities and requested the 
presence of Cuban Foreign Ministry officials. 
  Luis Garcia Peraza, deputy director of the Europe Department 
of the Foreign Ministry, went to the embassy in representation 
of his ministry. The ambassador told him the occupants refuse 
to leave the site despite the fact he personally has urged them 
to leave immediately. 
  The German mission has its own security. PRENSA LATINA has 
learned that four guards are in charge of this embassy's 
protection. 
  Trefftz said he would keep the Cuban Foreign Ministry 
informed about the situation, although he has not given the 
names of the people inside the building. 
  Alfonso explained that the Cuban Foreign Ministry has 
reiterated the well-known Cuban position that this type of 
violation of diplomatic missions accredited in the country is 
unacceptable as an alternative to the legal procedures that must 
be followed to travel outside national territory. 
  Cuba considers this a provocation and also a carefully 
planned illegal action executed at the moment the president of 
Mexico was arriving in Cuba and on the eve of the 4th 
Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias. 
  The spokesman noted that the origin of this incident is the 
growing sense of frustration among people who form what he 
described as the anti-fatherland sector abroad, because of 
Cuba's victories in the international arena. 
  This also constitutes, according to Alfonso, additional 
evidence of the negative results of the United States policy of 
denying visas to people wanting to travel to that country.

<F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez: "According to Cuba, Illegal Entries </F>
Into Embassies Are Planned"] 
  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Government has 
characterized the illegal forced entry by 20 people into the 
German Embassy in this capital as a carefully planned and 
unacceptable action. 
  The entry took place early in the morning after a truck 
crashed through the gate of the embassy's garage. This is the 
second violation of embassy territory in the past 15 days. 
  Only two weeks ago, another aggressive group broke into the 
residence of the Belgian ambassador, and although seven of the 
occupants have left the installation on their own, the rest have 
so far refused to heed requests by the Brussels and Havana 
Governments. 
  Shortly after today's incident, the German ambassador asked 
the instigators of this unexpected action to leave the embassy, 
but the occupants ignored the will of the diplomat. 
  The German position in demanding that the occupants leave 
the 
embassy immediately agrees with Cuba's official position of 
rejecting this type of action as a means to travel outside the 
country in open disregard for normal procedures now in effect. 
  One important element to be highlighted in this case, 
according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry, is that it has taken 
place precisely on the day that Mexican President Carlos Salinas 
arrived in the country and on the eve of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government. 
  Some diplomatic sources believe that the main objective 
behind these actions is to divert attention from the 
increasingly stronger ties now developing between the Caribbean 
nation and many countries and international organizations. 
  The same sources believe that another objective is to 
neutralize the international movement -- a movement flourishing 
even within the United States -- that opposes Washington's 
economic and trade blockade and supports the normalization of 
relations with the island. 
  Cuba has reiterated that there will be no reprisals against 
those who voluntarily leave the occupied embassy, just as in the 
case of those who have left the Belgian ambassador's residence.

  [Text] Havana, 15 Jun (PL) -- Cuba reiterated today before 
the diplomatic corps accredited in this country its opposition 
to the illegal occupation of diplomatic missions by people who 
want to abandon the country. 
  The Foreign Ministry [Minrex] summoned the heads of the 
foreign missions and briefed them on the current situation 
regarding the presence of three groups that forced their way a 
few days ago into the residence of the Belgian ambassador and 
the German Embassy, as well as the Chilean consulate. 
  Minrex Spokesman Miguel Alonso later told the local and 
foreign media that according to Cuba the firmness by all the 
sides affected by these incident favors a possible prompt 
solution. 
  Nine people, including a woman and a child, participated in 
the most recent illegal entry, which occurred at the Chilean 
Consulate. 
  Alonso explained the Cuban Government has reiterated to the 
ambassadors its decision to help resolve the problem caused by 
the occupants of their respective buildings. He ruled out any 
legal action against those who voluntarily leave. 
  Those transgressions cannot replace the country's current 
normal procedure to travel abroad, nor is it acceptable to try 
to force an ambassador into granting a visa, he added. 
  During the meeting, Cuba reaffirmed that in accordance with 
international agreements, it respects the sanctity of embassies 
and offers protection to all missions accredited in this 
Caribbean nation.

<F P=106> [By Manuel Robles Sosa] </F>
  [Text] La Paz, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Ibero-American Summit 
being held this week in Cartagena de Indias should serve to 
consolidate that international forum, according to Bolivian 
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada. 
  The chief of state made this statement in an interview 
granted to PRENSA LATINA before beginning an overseas tour that 
will include his participation in the Ibero-American Summit. He 
described the summit as important to help the member-countries 
coordinate their policies, adding that it will serve as a 
fitting venue for the presidents to discuss topics that interest 
them. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what are your expectations regarding 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? What do you think the 
summit's priorities should be? 
  [Sanchez] Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, I must note 
that it is a meeting whose importance is undeniable to the 
extent that it will permit the definitive consolidation of this 
international forum and will serve as a hub for relations among 
member-countries. 
  In keeping with modern times, the most important topics will 
deal with the implementation of the most dynamic mechanisms of 
commercial exchange and regional and subregional integration. 
At the same time, such mechanisms could serve as the means to 
aid the various countries in their struggle to consolidate their 
internal development and to strengthen the social policies that 
will improve the living standards of the people. 
  [Robles] What is your assessment of the Ibero-American 
summits held so far? Do you think they have met expectations? 
  [Sanchez] The preceding summits were highly significant, 
because for the first time we set up a mechanism for 
Ibero-American relations. In this area, we can stress two 
principal achievements: 
  A. Following its inception, policies are now coordinated 
among member-countries, and cooperation and integration among 
the countries have improved, both on the bilateral and 
multilateral level. 
  B. Attendance at these summits is significant, considering 
that the presidents avail themselves of such meetings to discuss 
topics that are of particular interest, especially on the 
bilateral level. 
  Also, I must note, that on this occasion the meeting will 
broach the problem of the native and Indian peoples of the 
continent. This demonstrates that important progress has been 
made in identifying the new social problems and permits 
consolidating and strengthening the democratic processes in the 
region. 
  [Robles] Considering the importance your administration 
attaches to international cooperation, what are your 
expectations regarding the Ibero-American Summit is this area? 
  [Sanchez] This Ibero-American Summit must attempt to 
strengthen the objectives outlined in previous summits and also 
render a renewed impetus for regional integration, through the 
analysis of topics such as trade, sustained development, and 
cooperation, seeking to alleviate the existing social problems. 
  [Robles] Some time ago your government announced a 
diplomatic 
plan of action aimed at decriminalizing the international trade 
of the coca leaf. Will you broach this option at the 
Ibero-American Summit? 
  [Sanchez] At the next summit, the Bolivian Government will 
present findings to the rest of the countries that demonstrate 
the process of structural reforms undertaken and the new views 
to be implemented in terms of efforts against drug trafficking. 
  [Robles] How do you view Latin American integration, its 
progress, and perspectives? 
  [Sanchez] Latin American integration is at a stage of 
complete development, seeking to consolidate its main mechanisms 
by reviewing and updating them. This new view includes a common 
perception on the viability of open regionalism, whereby 
countries that conform to different mechanisms will encounter 
fewer obstacles in negotiating with similar regional groups, 
thereby fulfilling the principal goal of overseeing Latin 
American regional integration, ensuring its flexibility, and 
seeking to include all of the nations in their unity proposal. 
  [Robles] Considering the priority that your government 
assigns to integration with its neighbors, could you give us 
your views in this regard? 
  [Sanchez] Bolivia attaches particular importance to regional 
and subregional integration, because it is believed that this 
policy will jointly promote the internal development of the 
member-countries and of the diverse economic coordination 
mechanisms. 
  [Robles] Mr. President, what means do you see for merging 
the 
existing subregional blocs into a vast integrated framework? 
Should this merger be based on pluralism? 
  [Sanchez] Undoubtedly, pluralism has become one of the key 
elements of Latin American integration. Since the creation of 
the Latin American Integration Association in 1980, our 
countries have considered the final goal of regional 
coordination policy to be the formation of a single continental 
bloc. This will be possible to the extent that democratic 
systems are consolidated in our countries, which supposes the 
active practice of pluralism, both internally within each 
country and in its foreign relations. 
  [Robles] What are the achievements, the biggest problems, 
and 
the tasks faced by your administration? How are you coping with 
the social problems faced by your government? 
  [Sanchez] My administration finds itself at a very 
significant point in Bolivia's history. The reforms we are 
implementing are of a structural nature. At this moment in 
time, we are focusing on the capitalization laws, the education 
reforms, and reforms dealing with the people's participation. 
Our final goal is to consolidate democracy, improve the 
Bolivian people's standard of living, and last, make tangible 
our desire to achieve the country's overall development. We are 
seeking all of this within a framework of a renewed concept of 
overall and sustained human development based on economic 
growth, social justice, participative democracy, respect of the 
environment, and international solidarity.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas Granados: "U.S. Immigrants, a </F>
Terrorizing Monster Called Alien"] 
  [Text] In the past decade, the word immigrant has virtually 
disappeared from daily use as a way of identifying the foreigner 
who arrives in the United States in search of achieving "the 
American dream." Now they are called "aliens," as if they are 
attempting to equate immigrants to the repulsive film monster, 
the lethal threat to humans, through evil semantic manipulation. 
  It is not the fault of Hollywood director Riddley Scott, who 
intended to make money and provide fun to moviegoers when in 
1979 he launched his film "Alien." He never insinuated a 
similarity between the immigrants and that repulsive 
gelatin-like creature that was willing to annihilate the human 
species. 
  Anyway, what is certain is that starting some years ago the 
word "immigrant" has been used less and less in the United 
States when referring to a foreigner who arrives in that nation 
possibly attracted by the cliche words of Emma Lazarus written 
at the base of the Statue of Liberty: "Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free." Now, 
instead of being called "immigrants," they are called "aliens," 
with all the disdain contained in the semantic value of the 
word, which means "strange," "unrelated".... 
  According to Victor Inzunza, director of the 
Mexican-American 
Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF, from its name in 
English) there is a "vicious evil" directed against immigrants 
in the United States. He added that "what I find more 
disquieting is the almost absolute lack of compassion and 
reasoning in the national debate on immigration." 
  What has happened in this country where, according to what 
many experience, over 60 million immigrants of 120 ethnical 
backgrounds have molded the United States' national identity 
from the 1500's all the way to the present? 
  A CBS Television Network poll, which was conducted in 
January 
of this year and whose results were disclosed 22 May, shows that 
53 percent of those interviewed say immigrants cause problems, 
while 22 percent believe they should be deported back to their 
country of origin, especially those who arrived in the United 
States during the last five years. The rejection of these 
immigrants seem to have a racial tone because a majority of the 
1,210 people interviewed associate immigrants with Latin America 
or Asia. This, perhaps, could be the reason why 43 percent 
agree with U.S. officials' introducing selective criterion into 
their immigration policy. 
  This issue of "selectiveness" is not a new suggestion in 
dealing with immigration-related problems. Following the Los 
Angeles earthquake in January of this year, the controversial 
issue of whether or not illegal immigrants were entitled to 
public assistance was raised, as if to say the immigration 
status of an individual were enough to exclude him or her from 
receiving subsidies in the aftermath of such a tragedy. 
  There are even those who have proposed worse solutions. One 
such individual is California Governor Peter Wilson, who 
supports denying medical and educational services in order to 
compensate the lack of federal subsidies to cover the public 
expenses that illegal immigrants create. Furthermore, he 
supports the idea of not granting U.S. citizenship to the 
children of illegal immigrants. 
  To prevent the "aliens" from doing away with the "noble" 
human race in the United States, Janet Reno, the enthusiastic 
U.S. attorney general, announced in February a $540 million 
program directed at virtually sealing off the Mexican border. 
Democratic Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming proposed a plan to 
cut back the number of legal immigrants allowed in the United 
States, estimated at over 675,000 per year. 
  There are several very ill-intended proposals, such as that 
of Representative Dana Rohrabacher of California, who presented 
a reform bill that would oblige education authorities to 
identify high school students who are unable to prove their 
legal status in the country and thus expose them to deportation. 
Rohrabacher's bill also included the suspension of federal 
funding for high schools that serve the illegal alien community, 
but a group of U.S. congressmen and women of Hispanic origin, 
led by Democrat Jose Serrano, was able to avert this 
anti-immigrant attempt for now. 
  They were also successful in defeating a draft bill 
sponsored by Toby Roth, Republican representative for Wisconsin, 
which would have eliminated the $215 million budget earmarked 
this year for the bilingual education system, which mostly 
benefits the children of Latin American immigrants. 
  "As a teacher and a Latin American, I believe it is an 
insult 
for people to propose ending bilingual education," according to 
Edwin Espaillant, vice president of the United Federation of New 
York Teachers, where 36 percent of the million students are 
Hispanic and where there are 67 bilingual education programs. 
  Other measures include greater sanctions against people who 
employ undocumented individuals, more restrictions for work 
permits, and a charge of up to $170 to political asylum seekers, 
the number of whom according to federal statistics, surpassed 
150,000 last year. 
  "This policy is nothing more than part of the current move 
against immigrants that, in addition, has a deeply racist 
component, considering that most of them are from the so-called 
Third Word," according to Franklin Velazquez, policy director 
for New York's Immigrant Rights Center. 
  The anti-immigrant offensive against "aliens" is mainly seen 
in cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami, where the 
greatest number of people from Latin America have arrived either 
legally or illegally. 
  A Federal Census Bureau report issued in April forecasts 
that 
by the year 2020 the Latin population in the United States will 
surpass 51.2 million to become the country's largest minority 
group. 
  Perhaps this could be one of the reasons for the 
anti-immigrant campaign, which in its offensive, includes a 
study by the Carrying Capacity Network [preceding name published 
in English] organization, which is led by Dr. Donald Huddle, an 
expert of the Economics Department of Rice University in Texas. 
The study blames "aliens" for the 914,000 people who were 
unemployed in California in 1992, with losses exceeding $42 
billion. 
  This is simply another flank attack by this trend. The 
extended use of words such as "aliens" or "illegal" not only 
serves to perversely deform the meaning of the word immigrant 
until it makes it sound as if it were a criminal, but it also to 
presents them as people from another world and greatly to blame 
for U.S. economic problems. 
  Jesus Hernandez Cuellar, editor of the Metropolitan Section 
of LA OPINION newspaper in Los Angeles, believes that the hidden 
purpose of this cloaked xenophobia seems to be aimed at trying 
to "use foreigners as scapegoats for a problem that has its 
roots in administrative inefficiency and in the weight of the 
unsupportable government bureaucracy." 
  Hernandez recalls that a study published in July 1992 by 
BUSINESS WEEK showed that immigrants in the United States 
comprise a labor force that surpasses 11 million people who pay 
more that $90 billion in taxes every year, much more than the $5 
billion the government spends on social assistance to these same 
people. 
  With more than 3 million undocumented foreigners in the 
United States, the authorities face a problem with considerable 
social and economic implications. "The authorities have every 
right to regulate and protect borders, as well as to try and 
restrict immigration, but they should act humanely and with 
compassion," Victor Inzunza of MALDEF [expansion unknown] said. 
  "We, in the United States, speak of human rights violations, 
but is it not a violation to deny immigrants their human 
dignity?" asks Jose Serrano, leader of a group of U.S. 
congressmen of Hispanic origin. 
  According to Izunza, U.S. authorities must understand that 
the most effective method against illegal immigration is to 
support the countries from which they come. "The government 
should concentrate on aiding these countries to enable their 
citizens to keep their families and not have to look for a new 
way of life in the United States." 
  There should not be any arbitrary actions either, such as 
the 
so-called Cuban Adjustment Law, which because of ideological 
differences between Washington and Havana, legal and illegal 
Cuban immigrants receive preferential treatment over other 
foreigners such as Haitians and Central Americans. 
  That law states that any Cuban immigrant who remains in the 
United States for more than one year may request and receive the 
work permit known as the "Green Card," a privilege that for 
Democrat Representative Alan Simpson is "absurd." 
  The struggle against "aliens" also has its share of 
political 
opportunism.

  [Text] Havana, 10 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuba highlighted the 
increasing rejection of the U.S. economic and trade embargo 
against the island. Cuba pointed out recent decisions by 
several international organizations and within certain circles 
in the U.S. Congress itself. 
  The Cuban Foreign Ministry expressed its satisfaction for 
statements made to this effect at the last meeting of the Latin 
American Economic System (SELA) and at the Cairo meeting of the 
Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Foreign Ministers. 
  This is the first time SELA has ever approved a resolution 
rejecting the blockade. It goes even further than the 
resolutions issued by the UN, the ministry added, as it 
expressly calls for the lifting of the punitive measure. 
  Referring to the NAM meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Miguel Alfonso said the ministers' statement is stronger than 
other resolutions previously approved by the organization. It 
specifically supports similar decisions approved by the UN, and 
with which the United States has yet to comply. 
  Regarding what he called the increasingly evident 
international rejection of the economic and trade prohibitions 
against Cuba, Alfonso underscored the events that took place on 
9 June in several U.S. cities, demanding an end to the policy. 
  Lobby Day, as it was called, featured activities by a 
coalition of over 45 national and state organizations supporting 
a bill presented by Congressman Charles Rangel, who is calling 
for the lifting of the embargo. 
  One of the main events was a round table discussion in the 
U.S. Senate, which addressed the current Cuban situation and 
relations between the two countries. Several members of 
Congress and other political, cultural, and media personalities 
were present. 
  Alfonso, who met with local and international reporters, 
also 
mentioned recent statements by Latin American foreign ministers 
within the context of the last OAS meeting. The ministers 
called for the organization to change its policies regarding 
Cuba. 
  It is this series of reactions, he pointed out, that make it 
increasingly evident that support for the idea of an alleged 
international isolation of the country is vanishing.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- It was officially reported 
today that less than one year after self-employment was 
authorized, more than 48,000 Havana residents are self-employed 
in the 135 activities that Cuban authorities approved, while 
4,000 requests have been denied. 
  The Labor Directorate of the city of Havana stated several 
of 
the categories included in Decree Law 141 approved in September 
1993 are currently frozen in the capital. 
  The directorate stated the rejections registered until the 
end of May were basically issued because the requests did not 
fulfill the requirements established by the Provincial 
Administration Council, which is in charge of this activity, and 
due to the bad social conduct of those making the requests. 
  Driver for hire, preparer of light foods, gatherer-seller of 
agricultural products, and video operator are among the 
positions for which no new permits are being granted, although 
those who initially obtained licenses maintain permits to offer 
those services. 
  The license for producer-sellers of flowers was withdrawn. 
  According to the explanations by Provincial Labor Director 
Manuel Fernandez, in all cases the decision was made in order to 
preserve the state's interests and avoid harming the national 
economy.

  [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- An editorial published today 
maintains that although the Cuban Government's applied financial 
adjustment measures postpone salary increases for now they do 
not seek to reduce the people's real income. 
  The weekly magazine TRABAJADORES indicates there is concern 
and uncertainty among the people regarding their income, 
following the decisions to cleanse the local economy and reduce 
excess cash in circulation, calculated at 11 billion pesos (an 
amount equal to dollars). 
  The measures include increasing certain prices and tariffs 
and eliminating several subsidies. The steps are directed at 
reactivating production and, therefore, supply. Experts say 
these factors will contribute to the restoration of the people's 
buying power. 
  After stressing this is not the time to raise the issue of 
general salary increases, the editorial column reminds readers 
the amount of cash in circulation does not necessarily determine 
the amount received but, rather, its purchasing power. 
  It goes on to explain that Cuban black market activities are 
often awarded certain virtues, but this activity, also known as 
the underground economy and deemed illegal and unproductive on 
the island, feeds on the state's resources or those that should 
be sold to the state. It simply redistributes the goods instead 
of promoting production. 
  Along this same line, and given the black market's inability 
to generate more products or services to meet the demand, it 
would be inconsistent to raise the people's salary with the 
current excessive levels of cash already in circulation. 
  The article also finds "salary adjustments to meet the price 
increases" an economic nonsense. This also renders as unviable 
production incentives by way of monetary awards or salary 
increases. 
  The TRABAJADORES editorial does recognize, however, 
influential sectors of the national economy, such as tourism, 
oil, mining, agriculture, the sugar industry, transportation, 
power generation, port movement, and other such activities do 
receive economic incentives in foreign currency for their 
production efforts. 
  TRABAJADORES underscored this procedure is consistent with 
the new economic system the Cuban authorities have designed, 
under the present circumstances, "to bring the Socialist formula 
of payment in accordance with the quantity and quality of each 
worker's contribution."

<F P=106> [By Eduardo Klinger Pevida, a PRENSA LATINA contributor and </F>
economist and professor at the Cuban Higher Institute for 
Foreign Relations: "Agrarian Reform in the State Sector of Cuban 
Agriculture"] 
  [Text] The restructurization of Cuban agriculture can be 
regarded, in fact, as the third agrarian reform law implemented 
in the country in the last 35 years. 
  In 1959, the Cuban Revolution implemented what would be the 
first agrarian reform in a country where 3 percent of the 
landowners controlled 56 percent of the country's total farming 
land; 25 percent of the best lands were owned by U.S. citizens. 
  The law had a profound effect on U.S. monopolies and the 
landowning oligarchy, but it still did not limit the possibility 
for capitalist development in agriculture. Afterward, in 1963, 
it became necessary to issue a second agrarian reform law that 
did have a socialist nature and concept, and it represented an 
important extension of the country's process of agrarian 
restructurization and a reduction in the structure of large 
landholdings, given its limited land ownership to 67 hectares. 
  State ownership of land reached almost 83 percent of the 
total surface or 75 percent of the farming surface. 
Agricultural and livestock production cooperatives, as well as 
credit and service cooperatives, represent 22 percent of the 
total farming surface today, whereas the thousands of individual 
small-scale farmers hold the other 3 percent. 
  The state-owned lands were organized into major farms. The 
development of ambitious state plans entailed substantial 
changes in Cuban rural areas, namely, mechanization, 
agricultural aviation utilization, the replacement of teams of 
animals, the increase of cultivated areas, the extension of 
irrigation, and large-scale use of pesticides, fertilizers, and 
herbicides. 
  Bad habits were also developed, however, as in the rest of 
the economy, with the creation of bureaucratic structures that 
engendered huge payrolls that had personnel not directly linked 
to production. Strong elements of disorganization also became 
the norm. 
  All of these factors had already been seen since the 
mid-1980's, and a series of actions, dubbed the process of 
errors rectification, was started, after the Socialist bloc 
vanished and the USSR fragmented, as it was with these states 
with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its trade and had 
reached an important level of integration. It was for that 
reason the effect on the economy was so severe. 
  A major plan of agricultural and livestock production was 
already designed in the second half of the past decade, a plan 
known as the food program, to allow the replacing of 40 percent 
of food imports. 
  The entire process of broad investment required to develop 
the necessary infrastructure was implemented, but the sources of 
essential supplies on which the country relied vanished. 
  Quite the opposite of the results expected for 1992 and 
1993, 
the country experienced a profound setback in production in 
almost all sectors. The agricultural situation is extremely 
difficult, creating a scene in which objective and subjective 
problems merge: 

  -  Fuel deficit 
  -  Shortage of spare 
parts 
  -  Lengthy drought as sugarcane was growing 
  -  Administrative 
and individual adjustments to await the resources that were 
received before. 
  -  Insufficient attention to the crops during 
sowing 
  -  Inadequate use of the available resources 
  -  Lack of 
stimulus for individuals 
  -  Disorganization and indiscipline 
  -  Deviation and subtraction of resources. 

  In view of this situation, the country's leadership decided, 
as part of the measures being implemented to revitalize the 
economy, to create the basic cooperative production units, UBPC, 
whereby farmers are given state lands for their own profit, and 
to base production on cooperatives. 
  As a matter of fact, this situation entails a profound 
structural change in the organization of agriculture in Cuba 
that will have a major importance and an extraordinary potential 
and scope. Although it has not been officially given that name, 
we are basically facing the third agrarian reform law the 
revolution is implementing. On this occasion, it is taking 
place within the state sector. 
  This new unit of organization: 

  -  Sets indefinite use of 
lands for profit 
  -  Owns production 
  -  Sells to the state 
  -  Obtains 
technical and material goods through purchases 
  -  Holds banking 
accounts 
  -  Acquires through credit fundamental means of 
production 
  -  Will pay fiscal obligations as contributions to the 
country's expenses. 
  -  Will elect as a group its leaders and 
administrators. 

  Four of the fundamental principles taken into consideration 
to create the UBPC are: 

  -  A direct link between the 
individual and the area of work 
  -  Production for the consumption 
of UBPC members and their families 
  -  The sharing of 
benefits 
  -  Greater self-sufficiency in terms of production with 
higher autonomy 

  The sole objective of this new organization of agricultural 
and livestock production is to obtain an adequate formula to 
face the crisis in a manner that succeeds in stimulating and 
motivating people to raise production with scarce available 
resourses under conditions of maximum efficiency and 
profitability. Now, this sector has to be efficient and 
decrease to a minimum the numerous resources it absorbs from the 
budget concerning subsidies. 
  Farm workers at the service of the state are becoming, by 
virtue of the new law, co-owners of production methods and 
actual production, and, therefore, they cease to be wage earners 
to share directly in the benefits. It is expected that with 
this measure, workers will be more dedicated as they become more 
supportive and motivated by this activity and that they will 
develop a mentality of economics and efficiency.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  The Salvadoran Coffee Council, CSC, reported that coffee 
exports during the past eight months had surpassed $120.2 
million. According to the CSC, this amount corresponds to 
1,031,735 sacks of coffee, each weighing 69 kgs, exported from 
10 October 1993 to 13 June 1994. It is part of the 1993-94 
coffee harvest period. Receiving countries include Germany, 
Belgium, Canada, Spain, Finland, France, Holland, Hong Kong, the 
UK, Italy, Japan, Norway, Portugal and the United States. CSC 
Executive Director Ruben Ernesto Pinto stated the current coffee 
harvest, despite being less than the 1992-93 period, will result 
in greater revenues for the country because of rising prices in 
the international markets. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 1838 
GMT 14 Jun 94) 
  According to recent official figures, during the past two 
years El Salvador recorded average annual GDP growth rates of at 
least 5 percent and has become one of the Latin American 
countries with the highest growth rate. After the signing of 
the January 1992 peace agreement between the government and the 
guerrillas which brought an end to the 12-year-old internal 
conflict, El Salvador implemented a process of political 
stabilization that reverberated in the country's economic 
growth. GDP, which in 1989 was merely 1.1 percent, increased to 
5.1 percent in 1992, and by 1993 real economic growth was 5.0 
percent. According to Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador, BCR, 
figures, GDP recorded growth rates during the first two months 
of the year totalled 7.2 percent. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 2343 GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  Recent official figures indicate that currency mailed by 
Salvadorans living overseas, mainly in the United States, to 
their relatives in El Salvador surpassed export revenues by 
$152.3 million during 1993. A BCR spokesman pointed out that 
during 1993, currency mailed to relatives totalled $884 million, 
while export revenues amounted to $731.7 million. During the 
first quarter of the current year, revenue originating from 
Salvadorans living in the United States has so far totalled 
$223.2 million. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2316 GMT 8 Jun 94)

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  Ricardo Santa Cruz, manager of the Agricultural Commission 
Association of Nontraditional Products, Gexpront, has said 
broccoli and pea harvests contribute nearly $50 million in 
revenues annually, an amount that represents nearly 30 percent 
of local sales of nontraditional goods and 8.3 percent of the 
total goods the country exports. The Gexpront official said 
broccoli yields nearly 170 million pounds each year, of which 40 
million tons are exported, resulting in revenues totaling $30 
million. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 
8) 
  Antonieta de Bonilla, acting president of the Bank of 
Guatemala, Banguat, has said that nearly 1 billion quetzals have 
entered the economy during the current year and that the process 
had not adversely influenced the inflation rate. She said that 
of that amount, 200 million quetzals were generated by open 
market operations, a similar amount came from compulsory 
investments, and another 200 million quetzals resulted from 
public sector deposits in Banguat. According to the Banguat 
official, the remaining 400 million quetzals have not negatively 
impacted the economy because it is invested in short-term 
investments. (Guatemala City SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 13 Jun 
94 p 8) 
  Official sources disclosed today that the Guatemalan trade 
balance during the first five months of the year recorded a 
$268.8 million deficit. Banguat stated that up until 2 June, 
trade balance exports had recorded $658.08 million in revenues 
and imports had amounted to $924.9 million. According to the 
Banguat Department of Economic Studies, the items that generated 
the most revenues were coffee -- $166.4 million -- and sugar -- 
$95.33 million. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 0020 GMT 11 Jun 94) 
  Banguat has announced that total net international monetary 
reserves had increased to $873 million during 6-11 June as 
opposed to the $870 million recorded the previous week. Net 
reserves had increased to $805 million as opposed to $801.2 
recorded a week earlier. Regarding available currency, a $646.6 
million increase in external liquidity had been recorded. 
Banguat sources have disclosed, however, that during the first 
week of June, the active interest rate (the rate applied to 
weekly loans) increased by 2.81 percentage points and now stood 
at 24.12 percent. Passive rates (rates applied to term 
deposits) fell by 2.60 percentage points and now stand at 14.16 
percent. (Guatemala City PRENSA LIBRE in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 60) 
  Official sources reported that Guatemalan banking system 
interest rates had been cut 1.2 percent (for the active rate) 
and 1.8 percent (for the passive rate) during the first quarter 
of the year. Banguat stated in a document entitled "Evaluation 
of the Monetary, Exchange, and Credit Policy" that the active 
rate has been cut from 25.7 to 24.5 percent, while passive rates 
had been cut from 13.7 to 11.9 percent. The Monetary Board, 
which is responsible for fixing economic policies, has stated 
one of its objectives during the current year is to cut market 
interest rates so as to diminish the cost of funds, as well as 
Banguat operation costs. (Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 
7 Jun 94 p 6)

  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] President Guillermo Endara has 
said that our country must be readmitted to the Rio Group, from 
which it was expelled when the military dictatorship ruled 
Panama. 
  [Begin Endara recording] I wish to bring to the attention of 
the appropriate heads of state a topic that I believe is of 
great importance and fairness for Panama and the Panamanian 
people. I am referring to the readmission of Panama as a full 
member of the permanent group for political dialogue and unity, 
better known as the Rio Group. 
  In February 1988, when Dictator Noriega overthrew the 
makeshift civilian president, right here in Cartagena, the Group 
of Eight suspended Panama from the group disclosing before the 
whole world the real anti-democratic form of government ruling 
my country at that time. I am taking this opportunity, this 
very important meeting, to express my wishes because it is my 
most heartfelt desire to see my people completely incorporated 
within Latin America before I leave office. 
  Today, having consolidated democracy, we have the moral 
authority to request that we be rightfully readmitted to a group 
that is very important. This will contribute to strengthening 
our integrating capacity for South and Central America, this 
latter region that, after many sacrifices, deserves the greatest 
praise. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  The National Economic Council has decided to cut the 
national 
investment budget by $198 million because of the international 
financial institution's, IFI's, decision to withhold funds from 
Panama, including a loan from the Japanese Government that is 
tied to a World Bank loan. The reason for this decision is that 
Panama has failed to meet certain IFI conditions. (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  President Guillermo Endara has reported that at a special 
cabinet meeting on 9 June, it was decided that there will be 
budget cuts in all ministries totalling $269.6 million. Endara 
explained that the 1994 budget has been balanced, but that all 
ministries will face cuts. The ministries that will be most 
affected are health, housing, public works, education, finance, 
and agricultural development. The reason for the cuts, Endara 
explained, is that the IFI's have suspended the disbursement of 
approximately $270 million because Panama has failed to meet 
certain requirements, including reducing the state payroll. 
Most of the cuts will be in the area of investments. (Panama 
City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 1) 
  Planning Minister Delia Cardenas and Health Minister Jose 
Remon have sent a letter to Lewis T. Preston, president of the 
International Reconstruction and Development Bank, detailing 
Panama's lingering poverty problem. The letter states that 
although the Panamanian economy is making great strides, the gap 
between the social classes is widening and poverty remains at 
approximately 44 percent. Cardenas and Remon explain that 
Panama's economy grew by 9.6 percent in 1991, 8.6 percent in 
1992, and approximately 5.9 percent in 1993. In 1992, the 
country's per capita GDP rose to $2,412 and investments 
increased 20.4 percent. The letter explains that the 
government's 1994 investment program earmarks 43 percent of its 
resources for social projects and that Panama is one of the 
Latin American governments that spend the most on health. The 
letter says an effort should be made to reduce poverty to 30 or 
35 percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 15A) 
  The National Bank of Panama collected more than $165 million 
in capital during the first four months of 1994, overcoming the 
$1.2 million deficit of early 1990. The bank has announced that 
its private deposits increased from $158 million in December 
1980 to $230.6 million on 30 April 1994. The bank's liquid 
assets also increased from 9.7 percent in December 1989 to 61.5 
percent on 30 April 1994. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television 
in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  Federico Humbert, a successful Panamanian businessman, has 
accepted President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares' challenge to 
head an executive office that will promote new foreign 
investments in Panama. Addressing members of the Inter-American 
Press Association, Perez Balladares said the purpose of the new 
office is to change Panama's bureaucratic mindset to one that 
will seek foreign capital and be more aggressive. Meanwhile, 
Humbert said: "I believe the new government has shown signs that 
it will favor a national concerted effort, which is what we all 
want to make Panama better for more Panamanians." (Panama City 
Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 7 Jun 94) 
  During May, the Colon Free Zone's cumulative sales totalled 
$4.131 billion, according to Free Zone statistics. Compared with 
the same period in 1993, overall sales increased 15.3 percent; 
imports increased 14.1 percent; and exports increased 16.4 
percent. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 13A)

  [Text] The heads of state and government from the 21 
nations of Ibero-America began the second and last day of their 
fourth summit behind closed doors in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia. The leaders all arrived this morning at the convention 
center by bus, except for Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez, who 
arrived in his own car, and posed together for the official 
summit picture. 
  Cuban President Fidel Castro, who this morning held a 
meeting 
with his Honduran counterpart, Carlos Reina, again appeared with 
a white guayabera and dark blue slacks, after surprising 
everyone yesterday, since it had been the first time he was seen 
without his uniform since the armed struggle began in Cuba in 
1956. 
  Yesterday, the Cuban leader met with Felipe Gonzalez and 
tomorrow, he is scheduled to meet with Eduardo Frei. He had 
already met with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in 
Havana. 
  During today's meeting, the last of the Fourth 
Ibero-American 
Summit, the presidents expressed their opinions in complete 
privacy on the central issues of the meeting, trade and 
integration, and will be able to freely discuss any other issues 
they wish. 
  It is expected that an important part of the discussion will 
center on Cuba, after Cuban President Fidel Castro lamented the 
fact that there had been no declarations against the blockade 
during yesterday's meeting. 
  On the other hand, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina 
denied that our country was disappointed by the developments of 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Robaina was interviewed by the 
media this morning and questioned on the lack of pronouncements 
on the U.S. blockade on Cuba, to which Robaina replied: We have 
no reason to be disappointed [words indistinct] on the debates 
regarding the blockade.

  [Excerpt] The Cuba issue is apparently the main course 
today during the second and last day of deliberations at the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which is currently under way at 
the seaside resort of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Before the 
conference, the media and one or two leaders repeatedly referred 
to the island -- mostly in an insidious way -- it was reported 
by a PRENSA LATINA news agency report. 
  During the summit's inauguration, once the speeches before 
the plenary session had concluded, Cuban President Fidel Castro 
demanded -- in a second speech -- respect for his country and 
recognition for the people given their tenacious resistance to 
the U.S. blockade. 
  The Cuban leader's surprisingly strong reaction perplexed 
most of the participants at the Cartagena de Indias meeting 
because they were suddenly confronted with a reality that cannot 
possibly be ignored, even if they tried to. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras from the </F>
"Doing Radio" newscast] 
  [Text] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit concludes today 
with the approval of a final document which undoubtedly has 
defficiencies, but nevertheless recognizes the need for joint 
effort in the economic integration sector. The document must 
also mention the need to improve the balance between nations 
with higher and lower levels of development, and in the social 
sector, it must insist that economic development is incompatible 
without its social counterpart. 
  To be honest, in a continent where neoliberalism is still in 
style, some of the ideas of neoliberalism are included, tempered 
with a list of some of the urgent social needs which afflict a 
majority of the 500 million human beings who live in countries 
of Iberian descent. 
  Because we do not know the final version of the document, we 
will not venture an overall analysis of the same. Fidel defines 
our position in a brief speech. Cuba does not reject foreign 
investment or some economic market mechanisms adapted to our 
national needs, but it believes that financing for development 
is insufficient. 
  Cuba also emphasized there are no definite solutions for the 
increase in Latin America's foreign debt. Cuba was the country 
to establish a clear position concerning the summons issued by 
the United States for a hemispheric summit -- with a cowardly 
exclusion in our case. The summit will be held in Miami in 
December this year. Cuba does not oppose this meeting if it 
really lets Latin America establish its legitimate positions 
before the northern metropolis, but it rejects any attempt by 
Washington to use the summit as an anti-Cuban forum or as a 
mechanism to increase Washington's hemispheric rule in the 
subcontinent's economic and social areas. 
  According to what we have learned and what special envoy 
Demetrio Villaurrutia has reported, the summit's final document, 
to be signed by the heads of state and government today at 
Cartagena de Indias, must demand the elimination of economic 
measures which negatively affect the free development of 
international trade and are detrimental to the lifestyle of 
Ibero-American peoples, in a much clearer allusion to the U.S. 
blockade against our country. This is an unprecedented action 
compared to previous summits. 
  We may recall that the final document for the last summit, 
the one held at Salvador de Bahia, endorses the decision adopted 
in other forums concerning problems, meaning the unfair blockade 
suffered by our country. This time there is a statement that is 
much more attuned to reality even though the term blockade is 
not mentioned. In essence, the final document of this fourth 
summit is not an ideal document that faithfully reflects the 
problems which afflict us as Latin Americans and Caribbeans, or 
urgently needed solutions. It is a position of consensus in 
favor of integration, however. In this concern, it is positive.

  [Text] Undoubtedly, clothes do not make the man. This can 
be confirmed by those who, yesterday, applauded when they saw 
the Cuban president arrive at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
with a smile on his face and looking slim. It would take less 
than an hour to thwart all the conjectures concerning the 
clothes worn by the leader of the Cuban Revolution. For the 
first time, he abandoned his olive green uniform to wear a 
typical Cuban guayabera. 
  His firm and courageous words, as on previous occasions when 
he stood at a national or international podium, dashed the 
assumptions of those who believed the change in attire indicated 
the Cuban position was crumbling. His direct, profound, accurate 
speech concentrated on denouncing the evils that afflict our 
America and those responsible for so much sorrow and poverty. He 
is the same Fidel -- profoundly Latin American, defender of the 
poor and disenfranchised, a courageous fighter against causes, 
or anything that obstructs Latin American development. 
  If there is any other possible interprepation for the 
clothes 
he wore at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, it would be only 
that the guayabera is an article of Cuban clothing; it is in 
great taste; it was created near the Yayabo River; and its wear 
has become mandatory among Latin Americans. Therefore, it is 
another symbol, another part of our roots on which we stand in 
this hour.

<F P=106> [From the "National Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] The newspaper EL NUEVO HERALD today published an 
extract of the last book written by former U.S. President 
Richard Nixon, who passed away on 22 April. In his book, "Beyond 
Peace," the ultraconservative statesman, who was an enemy of the 
Cuban Revolution, expounds on his theory about the policy that 
should be followed by the United States regarding Cuba and 
discusses the blockade issue. 
  We give details of journalist Marco Castellon's commentary 
on 
this issue in "Doing Radio": 
  [Begin Castellon recording] In his book, Nixon recommends 
the 
separation of political and economic relations with Vietnam, 
allowing each to develop at its own pace. Although he recognizes 
differences between the Vietnamese reality and the Cuban 
reality, he encourages something similar concerning Cuba. 
  In Cuba's case, former President Nixon says a considerable 
part of the pressure to maintain the embargo is derived from the 
old belief, particularly among many members of the exiled Cuban 
community, that it is the best way to put an end to what he 
terms the cruel and destructive Castro regime. Therefore, he 
leaves no doubt about his position concerning the Cuban process. 
  He nevertheless recognizes that, following the Soviet 
Union's 
collapse, economic conditions on the island worsened; and after 
35 years of Fidel Castro's government, hardliners who oppose him 
have not been able to destroy him. Therefore, he says it is time 
to change the goal sought by the North American policy, from 
trying to harm the Cuban Government to helping the people 
because, Nixon thinks, it is highly unlikely the island will 
become a subversive threat in the hemisphere even if the Cuban 
economy improves. 
  This means the economic embargo should be lifted to permit 
trade, investments, and economic interaction between the United 
States and Cuba. He insists, of course, that ideas and 
information be allowed to flow as freely as products. [end

  [Text] The Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant 
in Cienfuegos has begun tests to start its machinery after 
almost 60 days of extensive repairs to Unit No. 2. Specialists 
from the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant reported 
that the work was satisfactorily carried out, which consisted of 
mainly a complete overhaul to the boiler, auxiliary equipment, 
and the pump. The most complex work carried out at the plant 
involved cleaning the sea water intake canal for treatment of 
the Czech units. 
  Once maintenance work has ended at the Carlos Manuel de 
Cespedes Thermoelectric Plant in Cienfuegos Province, all 
efforts will be entirely dedicated to repairs at Unit No.1 -- 
currently underway -- for its subsequent synchronization with 
the system by year end.

    [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 
at 1600 GMT on 14 June carries a 15-minute edition of its 
regularly scheduled "Straight Talk" program, with Eloy 
Concepcion, from TRABAJADORES magazine, and host Osvaldo 
Rodriguez, from BOHEMIA magazine. 
  Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that the new 
agriculture organizational structure does not rely on the 
creation of the new Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] 
alone. Rodriguez explains that the structure consists of 
individual farmers, farming cooperatives, Youth Labor Army [EJT] 
farms, in addition to a number of state enterprises. 
  Concepcion states: "Given the current conditions, it would 
be 
foolish, or ill-intentioned to expect to be able to fully supply 
the population with agricultural products overnight by grace of 
the Holy Spirit." 
  He goes on to explain that the shortage of resources has 
naturally resulted in a drop in agricultural yields, and adds: 
"The Cuban economy is still being dragged down; it carries a 
number of deficiencies; it makes a number of mistakes which I 
believe we are beginning to solve. They are well known, but are 
not foreign to the general national situation, namely, the 
excess of circulation which distorts the entire production, 
price, and commerce system. The second problem which I believe 
is vital and decisive is the enormous bureaucracy, which in a 
subtle and merciless manner limits initiative and development. 
It seems to me that Cuban agriculture faces a challenge. Given 
the current shortages and lack of supplies, spare parts, and 
equipment, the goal is to definitively break free from 
bureaucratic methods, centralized planning, state enterprise 
control over the UBPC, and the entire mechanism of paperwork and 
bureaucracy which determines where, how, and when to plant." 
  Rodriguez explains that the workers of the UBPC have to 
realize that they are in charge of production, not the state 
enterprise. He adds: "The best man was not always selected to 
head the UBPC. I believe that at times, the enterprise forced 
the selection of the worker in charge of the farm who was not 
the best suited in every case. The workers elected him, that is 
true, in a democratic manner, but we all know how this type of 
vote works when it is not done by secret ballot, and when, 
additionally, the process is not conducted properly." 
  Concepcion adds that autonomy is the key issue and limited 
only by the goal to supply the state with products. He adds: 
"The enterprise is a corpse; it has to disappear in terms of its 
previous and current functions, either that, or eliminate the 
provincial office of the Agriculture Ministry. One of the two is 
redundant in this type of structure. In agriculture, the 
decision levels must lie with the farm where the expertise lies." 
  Rodriguez and Concepcion go on to discuss the 
accomplishments 
of the EJT [Youth Labor Army] farms and the importance of 
workers welfare programs in order to motivate production. 
  Concepcion goes on to state: "Cuba has an army which has not 
needed to, nor would it ever, go around repressing the people. 
It has an army that has the virtue of being one with the people 
but is also an army that works to provide more food for the 
people. I believe this is the greatest merit of our army, of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of which the EJT is part." 
  After further praising EJT efforts in agriculture, 
Concepcion 
adds: "We see images of repressive forces in the streets hitting 
the people during protests. Cuba is among the few countries in 
the world, I say this free of any chauvinism, where we do not 
see the armed forces using tear gas to repress the people. The 
image we see is that of our soldiers working the plantain crops, 
producing, harvesting potatoes, etc. I believe this is part of 
our pride as Cubans and also our independence." 
  Rodriguez closes by praising EJT efforts to reduce costs.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido 
Di Tella has stressed that the proposal to compensate the 
Kelpers [preceding word in English] in an eventual change of 
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands is part of a negotiation 
mechanism considered "normal" throughout the world. 
  "It is not a question of making a payment in order to throw 
people out. I simply said that compensation could be given for 
the transfer (of sovereignty). This is quite normal throughout 
the world where this type of transfer has occurred. Although 
there have not been many such transfers, there has always been 
economic compensation," Di Tella said in a radio interview. 
  The foreign minister had stressed in an interview that he 
granted to the British newspaper THE FINANCIAL TIMES that the 
Argentine Government would be willing to "consider financial 
compensation" for the Malvinas residents "in view of the 
psychological distress that would affect them when they handed 
over the sovereignty of the islands." 
  In view of the repercussions regarding these remarks, Di 
Tella made it clear that the proposal to compensate the Kelpers 
[preceding word in English] "is part of a much more complex 
negotiation" between the involved parties. 
  "The consideration that must be taken into account first is 
how to deal with the way of life of the islanders. If this does 
not come first, "the issue of compensation will seem to be 
offensive. The economic part, which also exists and which I 
believe to be very important, would come after that," Di Tella 
said when referring to the government's proposal. 
  Through the constitutional reform that is under way, the 
2,000 Malvinas residents could obtain the legal status of a 
"minority" and this would legally guarantee respect for their 
language, religion, and customs. 
  This is established in a draft bill that the Foreign 
Ministry 
is studying and that the executive branch will presumably submit 
to the Constituent Assembly, which is sitting in the city of 
Santa Fe. The so-called Kelpers [preceding word in English] 
would then be considered Argentine citizens, although with the 
status of a "minority" with their own characteristics as is the 
case with the indigenous peoples or the members of some foreign 
communities. 
  The initiative is being developed by officials, politicians, 
and technicians of the Foreign Ministry headed by Di Tella on 
the basis of a proposal made by Justicialist Party Deputies 
Carlos Branda and Florencio Acenolaza. Acenolaza is the 
president of the Foreign Relations Committee.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 15 Jun (AFP) -- Lieutenant Colonel 
Joseph Michel Francois, chief of police in the Haitian capital, 
confirmed last night his loyalty and support for Army Commander 
General Raoul Cedras. 
  The chief of police also issued a communique condemning the 
position of his brother Evans, who, yesterday in Santo Domingo, 
demanded the resignation of Gen. Cedras to avoid a U.S. invasion 
of Haiti. 
  Evans Francois, a former diplomat who claims to be one of 
the 
masterminds of the 30 September 1991 coup d'etat against 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, also said he fears for the 
life of his brother.

  [Excerpt] Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Michel Francois has 
reacted to the statement made by his brother Evans Francois on a 
sister radio station. Lt. Col. Joseph Michel Francois informs 
the public in general and the members of the Haitian Armed 
Forces [FADH] in particular that his brother's stand does not 
bind him in any way. Fear or any other emotions engendered by 
some foreign threat do not exist and will not exist in him, Lt. 
Col. Joseph Michel Francois points out. This is why he reproves 
the unpleasant and untimely statements made about his chief, 
statements that reflect on the institution to which Lt. Col. 
Francois belongs and on his country, which need the solidarity 
and unity of all its sons in these stormy times. [passage

  [Text] The news is the open letter from the brother of the 
Port-au-Prince police chief to General Cedras. Mr. Evans 
Francois, who is in charge of a diplomatic mission in Santo 
Domingo, made some statements regarding the current juncture and 
condemned the handling of power since 30 September 1991. Mr. 
Francois, who demanded the resignation of Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
considered that the threats of intervention in the country are 
very serious. Here is a report on his statements: 
  [Reporter Renois] It was from Santo Domingo, the capital of 
the Dominican Republic, that Mr. Evans Francois wanted to reveal 
the content of his letter addressed to Gen. Raoul Cedras. The 
brother of the Port-au-Prince police chief seems to have taken 
very seriously the threats of intervention weighing on Haiti. 
  Considering that the threats were very imminent, Mr. Evans 
Francois invited Gen. Cedras to make the gesture that the whole 
country and the Army are expecting from him, in order to 
prevent, he says, the national soil from once more being stained. 
  He gave the guarantee that Colonel Michel Francois was ready 
to make some concessions in the nation's interest. Calling the 
entourage of Gen. Cedras a jungle gathering of professional 
crooked dealers, Evans Francois accused Cedras of hamstringing 
all the governments since 30 September 1991. Regarding the 
government of Judge Emile Jonassaint, Evans Francois revealed 
that most of the members of this government were chosen by Gen. 
Cedras himself. 
  Furthermore, he reproached the Army commander in chief for 
not having agreed to resign in exchange for the lifting of the 
embargo as was officially promised by the American Government. 
  While recognizing that he was one of the authors of 30 
September 1991, Evans Francois recognized that the coup d'etat 
has not been managed to the benefit of the nation and asked how 
many Aristides have we created since 30 September? Finally, Mr. 
Evans Francois showed great concern for the life of his brother, 
the police chief. Because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his 
respect for the hierarchy, he risks being eliminated following 
the example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul, says Evans Francois, 
specifying that the maneuvers had already started. Here is an 
excerpt of this letter from Mr. Evans Francois, addressed to 
Gen. Cedras: 
  [Begin Francois recording in progress] ... Make the gesture 
that the Haitian Armed Forces, all the Haitian social strata and 
the whole world, expect from you to safeguard the nation and the 
only institution that we have left. Only God knows how many 
concessions Col. Francois is ready to make in the framework of 
safeguarding the superior interests of this small nation. I 
would ask you, Mr. General, to behave honestly toward this young 
officer who, because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his 
respect for the hierarchy risks being eliminated, following the 
example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul. The maneuvers have already 
begun. 
  Mr. General, I, Evans Francois, who have always held up the 
country's prestige in the Dominican Republic as well as in 
Washington and the Bahamas, as a diplomat in charge of defending 
the interests of my compatriots in strict regard for the norms 
ruling international relations, have decided to address you this 
open letter, at this watershed where my country's sovereignty is 
threatened by the most powerful nation in the world, when the 
precarious life of the officers, noncommissioned officers, 
soldiers and their families, after being seriously affected by 
this embargo wrongly managed, are now in danger with the 
application of new sanctions due to your stubbornness, your ties 
to power, your greed, and your irresponsible and ambiguous 
behavior. On 30 September 1991, you made a democratic 
correction. In June 1993, you supported the parliamentary act 
recognizing Aristide as president. On 3 July of the same year, 
you signed, on Governors Island, the agreement affixing 30 
October for the return of the president in exile and [word 
indistinct] your anticipated retirement. You always fought with 
your reserved tactics, the constitutional government of Robert 
Malval until you replaced it with the Jonassaint government 
which was installed under the conditions known by everyone. [end 
recording]

  [Text] Is there an agreement between the Vatican and the 
Jonassaint government for the supply of food aid to Haiti? 
Confusion continues regarding the signing of this agreement. 
  The Vatican denied this information, while the minister of 
foreign affairs of the provisional government asserts that this 
agreement had been signed with a Vatican representative, and 
that the 75 tons of wheat which were promised will arrive in 
September. Rothschild Francois filed a report: 
  [Begin recording] [Francois] There is still confusion 
regarding an agreement that was reportedly signed between the 
Vatican and the Jonassaint government for a supply of wheat to 
Haiti. After the government in Port-au-Prince announced this 
information at the beginning of the week, the Vatican 
authorities formally denied the news on Tuesday [14 June]. The 
Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro, asserts that no Haitian 
political representative was received in the Holy See. 
  In Port-au-Prince, the minister of foreign affairs of the 
provisional government confirms the signing of this agreement 
with a Vatican employee. In an exclusive interview with Radio 
Metropole, Charles David specifies that the 75 tons of wheat, 
worth U.S. $35 million, would arrive in Port-au-Prince in 
September. 
  Mr. Minister, did you really sign this agreement? 
  [David] Certainly I signed this agreement. I do not wish to 
enter a war of denial which seems to nourish subtleties of 
Vatican diplomacy. I agreed to talk to you. I do not intend to 
hold a news conference or to send other messages. What I can 
tell you is that the wheat is coming. For the rest, serious 
people will get to understand the exact reality of things. 
  [Francois] When is the wheat coming? 
  [David] The wheat will arrive, according to the terms of the 
agreement, beginning on 30 September 1994. I signed this 
agreement with a representative of the Vatican state 
secretariat. That is all I want to say because I do not intend 
to nourish rumors or gossip, especially since one denial leads 
to another denial and to counterdenials. In brief, each person 
takes pleasure in this kind of tactic. One should not forget 
that this country is in crisis. It is the first time I have 
spoken. I make it a point to say that. I do not intend to speak 
often. I have work to do. I do it. 
  [Francois] Regarding the relations between the Vatican and 
Haiti, it should be noted that on 18 May, apostolic Nuncio 
Bishop Baldiceri renewed his support for the resigning 
government of Robert Malval. 
  Questioned on the policy of Judge Jonassaint in diplomatic 
matters, the minister of Foreign Affairs told us that he 
maintains some contacts abroad. Charles David explained that he 
is working for the nation's interests. 
  [David] I am certainly not idle. Right now, it is true, 
there 
is the loneliness of the long-distance runner. But at least, let 
us be serious. You are right to think that contacts were made. I 
do not have to say it aloud. Let me give you an example. 
  For many years, China was not recognized by the United 
States, by the big powers. Contacts were made however. In short, 
things moved forward quietly. What we want to say is that we are 
trying to build a policy first, to protect the Haitian people 
from the invasion, the occupation. 
  [Francois] Questioned about the Montreal press' criticism of 
him, Minister of Foreign Affairs Charles David replied he has 
accepted this post because of the threats weighing on Haiti and 
specifies that he is above all, Haitian. [end recording]

  [Text] What is going on within the Revolutionary Front for 
the Promotion and Progress of Haiti [FRAPH]? In a press release, 
the front has forbidden Mr. Louis Jodel Chambelain from making 
any statements on behalf of FRAPH. The general director of the 
front, namely Paul Arthur Fleurival Lahens, was contacted by 
phone and he spoke of polarization within the administrative 
staff. 
  [Begin Lahens recording, in Creole] In any political 
movement 
in gestation, there is something called polarization. As you 
know, the front includes Emmanuel Constant, secretary general of 
the organization; Louis Jodel Chamblain, national coordinator; 
and Paul Arthur Fleurival Lahens, general director of the front. 
  There is no problem. As I told you, there is only a 
polarization problem. But once it is a question of cooperation, 
everybody can get together. Certainly there are some mistakes. 
As the saying goes: To err is human. People may make mistakes, 
but they must not be grave mistakes. There is always a way to 
reconcile. We are only waiting for the appropriate time so there 
can be rallying cry. Then you will see that there is really 
nothing wrong. [end recording]

  [Text] Mexico will not allow the United States to meddle in 
domestic matters, unless it involves narcotics and only through 
the Drug Enforcement Agency, to prevent our sovereignty from 
being violated, Leandro Arellano, director general of Commercial 
Relations for Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific of the 
Foreign Relations Secretariat, has stated. He said our 
country's world image has not deteriorated, despite recent 
incidents of violence. 
  The Mexican Government has enough maturity to resolve its 
domestic problems without anyone's help. It is not necessary, 
therefore, for the United States to interfere to end the acts of 
violence we have experienced. 
  He stated the above during a brief interview after 
participating in the 19th international spring colloquium where 
he said that, although Mexico is renowned internationally today 
as an intermediate and very dynamic economy, the social cost of 
economic reforms has been considerable because the number of 
poor people has increased, which represents a pending and a 
priority debt. 
  He added that the plight of poverty cannot be resolved if 
the 
distribution of income is not modified and if a tax reform and a 
wage policy adjustment are not carried out, which will permit 
the benefits of the country's growth to not further increase the 
gap between the wealthy and poor sectors. 
  He also said that financial discipline, monetary prudence, 
economic openness, market development, and concentration of the 
state only on strategic areas are part of the guidelines that 
must be followed in the near future and whose results will be 
evident in the coming years. "As a result of these efforts, 
Mexico is renowned internationally today as a very dynamic 
intermediate economy," he stated. 
  Leandro Arellano said that sharing a common border of over 
3,000 km with the biggest military power on the planet and the 
principal promoter of some of the situations that reflect our 
reality in the nineties, "obliges countries such as ours to make 
diversification the key element of our international strategy."

  [Text] Mexico City, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Today, the Mexican 
Attorney General's Office (PGR) announced the arrest of the 
country's main heroin drug trafficker who is also the chief of a 
drug-trafficking band in the northern State of Chihuahua. 
  In a communique, the PGR reported that Rosario Pina 
Carrillo, 
alias "El Callado," was arrested 11 June based on an arrest 
warrant issued against him for crimes against health and for 
charges of planting, growing, and harvesting marijuana. 
  According to the PGR, "El Callado," also known as "El 
Huarache de Oro," operated in Sinaloa and also directed a band 
of drug traffickers in Casas Grandes, Chihuahua State, which 
borders with the United States. 
  The group, headed by Pina Carrillo, consists of brothers 
Leonardo and Roberto Pina Valenzuela, Pina Chito, and the 
Morenos, against whom arrest warrants have been issued, and they 
are also believed to have links with the band "Borunda Ponce," 
the report indicated. 
  The "Borunda Ponce" band consists of drug traffickers from 
the northern State of Sinaloa who are considered dangerous. The 
criminal organization "Borunda Ponce" operates in Casas Grandes, 
Chihuahua. They finance the planting, transportation, and 
commercialization of narcotics, from which they make large 
profits, the source reported. 
  The PGR said Pina Carrillo's arrest will make it possible to 
arrest other drug traffickers in the near future and thus 
disbanding both groups, something that would be a hard blow for 
the Sinaloa and Chihuahua drug cartels.

<F P=106> [Report by Elvia Moreno from the "Evening News Panorama" </F>
newscast -- live] 
  [Text] [Moreno] Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate for the National Action Party [PAN], met National 
Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] students today. Speaking 
to more than 7,000 supporters, PAN members, and opponants, the 
PAN presidential candidate said party policies should be 
practiced outside the university. Fernandez de Cevallos' speech 
did not last more than 35 minutes, however, because individuals 
carrying flags of the Aztec Sun Party [not further identified] 
kept harassing him, shouting: Fascist, Fascist, while his 
supporters shouted: Diego, Diego. 
  Passions were heated 10 minutes into his speech, and the 
skies were filled with objects that were later identified as 
rotten eggs, which broke when they hit reporters, supporters, 
and even the left lapel of Diego Fernandez de Cevallos' gray 
suit. Fernandez de Cevallos said the wounds received during a 
campaign bring honor, not discredit. 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I would like to ask 
the university students not to allow themselves to be provoked. 
Remember, [applause] remember that we are here to rescue 
freedom; we are here to rescue democratic actions; we are here 
to ensure the university will never be a den of outlaws. [end 
recording] 
  As Fernandez de Cevallos was speaking of his government 
platform and saying private and public education should be 
available to all, two hooded men in blue jackets on the 
esplanades below began to push, shove, and punch organizers of 
the rally and PAN supporters. It is noteworthy that the old 
people [viejerio] who usually accompany Fernandez de Cevallos 
were not frightened by these actions or by the loud voices and 
insults of the opponants of the former UNAM student and, today, 
PAN presidential candidate. 
  It was a cloudy day, and the esplanades at the university 
were almost full an hour before the rally. At the conclusion of 
the event, PAN supporters tried to find ways to get close to the 
so-called Jefe Diego, while his bodyguards led him to his car 
amid the shouts and hurrahs of his supporters. 
  At the end of the rally with UNAM students, Fernandez de 
Cevallos made very brief statements. He said he has nothing to 
complain about and that in returning home, as he has described 
the university, there was nothing that bothered him. This is 
what he said: 
  [Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I am a man who 
[words indistinct] I have nothing to complain about. I have 
returned home, and I feel at home. There is nothing that 
bothers or worries me. What I heard against [words indistinct] 
groups who are [words indistinct] quite right at a university.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  Reports by the financial group Asemex-Banpais have revealed 
the total amount of foreign capital invested in Mexican 
Government securities and variable income decreased by 4.98 
percent during the first four months of 1994 compared to the 
December 1993 balance. As a result, foreign investment in the 
stock market, the money market, and variable income market 
included, dropped from $76.5 billion in December of 1993 to 
$72.7 billion of last April. Asemex- Banpais has also stated 
that in the first four months of 1994, the prevailing financial 
instability triggered a decrease in the price of variable income 
assets. (Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p 50) 
  The Rubber Industry National Chamber stated today that in 
the 
past three years tire imports for Mexican vehicles increased 
almost 30 percent, from 360,000 units in 1991 to 960,000 in 
1993. The president of this organization told NOTIMEX this 
increase translated into severe losses for the national tire 
industry. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2113 GMT 8 Jun 94) 
  Deputy Finance Secretary Guillermo Ortiz has stated that 
during negotiations for Mexico to join the OECD, the government 
pledged to review NAFTA in order to see whether benefits of this 
agreement could be extended to OECD members as of 1998. (Mexico 
City LA JORNADA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 49) 
  Today, the World Bank approved three loans totaling $918 
million for Mexico. These funds are earmarked to resolve the 
country's major environmental problems, especially along its 
border with the United States. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
1748 GMT 9 Jun 94) 
  Today, the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) said the inflation rate 
went up 0.5 percent in May compared to the rate registered for 
April. This monthly increase is the smallest one registered in 
22 years. Banxico added that the May inflation rate reached 6.92 
percent, meaning the rate has remained one digit for 12 
consecutive months. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0057 GMT 10 
Jun 94) 
  On 9 June, Pedro Noyola, foreign trade under secretary of 
the 
Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat, said foreign 
investment projects in Mexico have remained at a satisfactory 
level despite recent political events. Noyola even disclosed 
Japan and Europe will make plans for expanding their industries 
in Mexico. He added that foreign investment figures registered 
during the first quarter of 1994 indicate an 80-percent increase 
compared with figures for the same period of 1993. The flow of 
foreign capital reached $5.1 billion from January to March 1994. 
(Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 17) 
  Starting 13 June, commercial banks will begin to refinance 
the debts for nearly 11 billion pesos in overdue loans to 
approximately 25 small and medium industries. This move will 
help alleviate the financial situation of many businesses and 
banks as a result of hikes in interest rates. (Mexico City 
Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 1330 GMT 10 Jun 94) 
  Construction of the first automotive plant of the Japanese 
company Honda began today in the city of El Salto, Jalisco, and 
will require a $50-million investment. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 0001 GMT 11 Jun 94) 
  Commerce and Industrial Development Secretary Jaime Serra 
Puche has said Mexican exports will reach $50 billion in 1994 
due to the implementation of NAFTA. This figure represents an 
unprecedented increase in Mexico's international trade. Serra 
Puche said the figures are very encouraging considering that 
during the first quarter of 1994, exports experienced a 
22.3-percent increase, which was higher than the percentage 
obtained in the same period of 1993. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 2229 
GMT 11 Jun 94) 
  Bank of Mexico reports have revealed the commercial banking 
system debt increased $1.9 billion during the first quarter of 
1994, amounting to $24 billion. With this increase, the 
commercial banking sector has the largest foreign debt after the 
federal government. According to Bank of Mexico official 
reports, the total foreign debt followed an upward trend 
regarding all sectors involved. During the first quarter of 
1994, the public debt reached $1.2 billion, the bank $1.9 
billion, and large private companies $2.7 billion. (Mexico City 
LA JORNADA in Spanish 12 Jun 94 pp 50, 60) 
  The country's small and medium industries, which generate 87 
percent of Mexico's production, are on the verge of bankruptcy 
due to the large tax burden and strict regulations they must 
bear. These industries must pay between 55 and 60 percent of 
their income for taxes and other regulatory obligations, 
compounded by the Finance Secretariat's "persecution and 
harassment" to make them pay their taxes on time. This 
situation has resulted in the highest amount of closings in this 
six-year period than in the past 20 years. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 36) 
  Today in Madrid, Mexico's National Securities Commission and 
the national commission of Spain's Stock Exchange signed an 
agreement to exchange information, guarantee their markets, and 
provide protection for investors. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in 
Spanish 0523 GMT 15 Jun 94) 
  Institutional Revolutionary Party candidate Ernesto Zedillo 
has offered to local businessmen to change the structure of the 
tax system so as to eliminate the atmosphere of "fiscal 
terrorism." He also anticipates that in January 1995, he will 
promote a "very generous" system of fiscal reductions as well as 
a review of the income tax to improve conditions for workers. 
Through a merger with the Mexican Maritime Transportation 
Company, International Mexican Petroleum Incorporated, a Mexican 
Petroleum subsidiary, began commercial activities of oil 
byproducts in markets in the Far East in May. (Mexico City EL 
FINANCIERO in Spanish 14 Jun p 6)

  [Text] Army Commander in Chief General Augusto Pinochet 
returned to the country this morning following his controversial 
trip to various European countries. The military delegation 
headed by General Pinochet arrived from Great Britain aboard a 
British Airways plane at 1000 this morning. 
  During his visit to Europe, the Army commander visited 
several weapons manufacturing companies. During these visits, he 
had to face demonstrations opposing his visit. In our country, 
some congressmen criticized him for using resources for a trip 
of this nature. 
  Defense Minister Edmundo Perez Yoma expects to receive a 
report from Gen. Pinochet on his European trip. 
  [Begin recording] [Perez Yoma] I will meet with Gen. 
Pinochet 
as soon as possible so he will have an opportunity to submit a 
report. 
  [Unidentified reporter] What about the reactions of 
officials 
of the Czech and Netherlands Governments, and in other countries 
he visited? What do you think of those reactions? 
  [Perez Yoma] We believe the trip was completely normal with 
no setbacks whatsoever. There were some explainable journalistic 
reactions that did not affect the trip whatsoever. I think the 
trip was absolutely normal. 
  [Reporter] Isn't the government affected by reactions of the 
Czech interior and defense ministers who said that... 
  [Perez Yoma, interrupting] I have no official report on 
those 
reactions. Therefore, I cannot answer your question. 
  [Reporter] The Czech interior minister said that it was a 
mistake to grant a visa to Gen. Pinochet. 
  [Perez Yoma] I am unaware of such a statement. (end

  [Text] National Defense Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Jorge 
Patricio Arancibia has stated that the Chilean and Peruvian 
Armed Forces have substantially improved their relationship as a 
result of the annual meetings held by their respective chiefs of 
staff. 
  He said that in his opinion the history of the Latin 
American 
countries has been marked by conflicts that have regrettably 
affected the continent's relationships. Arancibia said: "This 
has become a sort of culture which we are trying to modify with 
these meetings designed to make our relationship more feasible, 
pleasant, and attractive." 
  Yesterday Arancibia presided over the inauguration of the 
second meeting of the Chile-Peru working group. This is a 
preliminary meeting to the IX Round of Talks between the Chilean 
and Peruvian Armed Forces High Commands scheduled to be held at 
the end of the month in Lima. 
  The meeting started at 0900 in hall No. 7 of the Diego 
Portales building and was attended by two special commissions: 
the Peruvian commission headed by Army Colonel Mario Lucero 
Welblund and the Chilean commission led by Air Force Colonel 
Nelson Sanhueza Lagos. 
  Vice Adm. Arancibia added that during these preliminary 
meetings the specific subjects to be discussed during each joint 
meeting of the chiefs of staff of the various Armed Forces' 
branches will be chosen. 
  Arancibia said: "During the past nine years we have made 
progress regarding a series of measures that have allowed a 
rapproachment and allowed us to establish greater and closer 
relations of mutual confidence." 
  Arancibia said that this rapproachment has resulted in 
exchanges, among other things, in the welfare field as well as 
of books edited by the armed institutions of the two countries. 
  He added that contacts have been established at the border 
sector chief level and this has made it possible to effectively 
tackle and solve problems that have appeared in that area. 
  The working sessions between the representatives of the 
chiefs of staff of the Chilean and Peruvian Armed Forces lasted 
all day yesterday.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria Paz Lopez-Hermida] </F>
  [Excerpts] Officials are quite optimistic that in the near 
future Chile may join either the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (TLC, or NAFTA) or achieve a bilateral trade agreement 
with the United States. 
  Before choosing between these two options, which is already 
being negotiated in Washington, Chile must commit itself to 
improving its intellectual property system, among other things. 
This probably involves one of the most complex issues of 
Chilean legislature, affecting thousands of people. 
  For the time being, nothing has been decided on the changes 
that must be made. The studies that are being made center on a 
TLC chapter referring specifically to intellectual property and 
the negotiations that Chilean officials have been conducting 
with the White House. No matter what is decided, intellectual 
property is an important issue that must be studied. Mexico is 
well aware of this, as when it negotiated its entrance in NAFTA 
last year this was one of the issues that raised the most 
difficulties. 
  The issue that will cause the most difficulties is probably 
that of medicine patents. Chile was the first Latin American 
country to implement regulation for the protection of 
pharmaceutical inventions. This will be the "letter of 
presentation" for achieving a treaty. 
  The United States is, however, demanding from its commercial 
partners regulations that are rejected by some local sectors. 
  One of the issues to be amended in the current legislation 
refers to the period of time during which a patent holder is 
granted a monopoly to exploit one product. The TLC establishes 
that the duration of this monopoly must be 20 years from the 
time the patent is requested. In Chile this period lasts for 
only 15 years from the time the patent is granted. The Economy 
Ministry has explained, however, that this issue should not 
raise many problems, because in practice the proceedings 
involved for the issuance of a patent may take up to 2 or 3 
years. This means that in Chile a patent may last for up to 18 
years from the time it is requested. 
  There are problems concerning the second issue that should 
be 
amended in Chilean legislation in view of the TLC. It concerns 
the recognition of patents granted abroad before the Chilean 
regulation was enforced. When the patent law was approved in 
1991, it was explained that it was not applicable to existing 
medication because one of the requirements for requesting a 
patent is that it should be an innovation at the international 
level. This article is precisely the one the United States 
wants changed. 
  The Association of Pharmaceutical Industries and 
Laboratories 
(Asilfa) is opposed to this possibility. Asilfa Chairman Miriam 
Orellana said that such an amendment would erase from the market 
a large percentage of inexpensive medicines, which would affect 
consumers. To justify her argument she cites the case of 
Mexico, which in 1991 had to accept a clause retroactive to 
1987. Orellana said: "Prices experienced a considerable 
increase, and the promises of greater foreign investment fell 
through when many companies shut down their local factories 
because imported products were preferred." 
  However, it is not only a question of drafting amendments. 
There is no Chilean legislation on some of the issues demanded 
by the TLC, and we will be compelled to make commitments during 
the negotiations. Experts say that there are many technical 
details that must be studied. 
  Among them is the industrial secrets issue, which in the 
United States is controlled by extensive and strict regulation. 
It deals with any technical knowledge of important value to a 
company and which that company does not want revealed. [passage 
omitted] 
  In Chile some laws state that an employee cannot divulge 
confidential information of the company he works for, but we 
must draft legislation that includes stricter measures on 
company secrets. 
  Another issue absent from Chilean legislation is that 
concerning integrated circuits. The United States asks for 
special legislation covering integrated circuit designs that 
currently allow the operation of any electronic device. 
Integrated circuits are not included in the law because the 
current level of national technology does not allow a true 
incursion into this field. It is obvious, however, that for 
more developed countries these constitute a major business. 
  Beyond any conflicts of interest that may arise, most people 
believe that any amendments to the legislation should aim at 
decreasing the piracy of legally patented works. [passage 
omitted] 
  Many believe that the secret lies in officials not 
discussing 
issues separately, but as a package. The idea is that although 
we have to yield on some issues, in others we can make Chilean 
interests prevail.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 15 June. 
  The National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane) 
reports the cost of the family basket rose 1.54 percent in May, 
while inflation for middle income families rose 1.53 percent and 
1.58 percent for lower income families. Consumer prices rose 
13.65 percent during the first five months of 1994. Dane 
reports that in the last 12 months accumulated inflation rose to 
23.86 percent, 1.65 percent higher than the previous 12 months. 
The highest increases were registered in apartment rents (2.66 
percent), domestic service (2.52), and fuel and utilities (2.18 
percent). Public utilities rose in May as follows: electricity 
3.22 percent, residential telephone service 3.59 percent, and 
water and sewage services 1.77 percent. Health care costs also 
rose as follows: medicines 2.82 percent, and professional 
services 1.18 percent. The family basket rose 1.3 percent due 
mainly to increases in the price of yucca, rice, potatoes, 
bread, meat, and cocoa. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 
2 Jun 94 pp 6B, 7B) 
  According to an official source, the Medellin Aeronautical 
Society (Sam) and Colombian National Airlines (Avianca), both 
owned by Grupo Santo Domingo, will merge in basic operations and 
support, but each will preserve its own identity. The source has 
also denied rumors that Sam would be dissolved and its employees 
laid off. Rafael Carbonel, general director of the labor 
office, has said neither Sam nor Avianca has requested a 
concurrence to fire employees. An airline source said the 
merger would affect maintenance and accounting as well as 
regional offices. No massive firings are planned although 
certain positions will be abolished. Sam employees have also 
denied their contracts had been canceled. (Santa Fe de Bogota 
EL TIEMPO in Spanish 6 June 94 pp 1A, 8A)

  [Excerpt] Quito, 15 Jun (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government 
today set 7 August as the date for the referendum which 
President Sixto Duran-Ballen announced on 10 June and which most 
of the opposition political forces in the country have described 
as illegal. During a radio and television network today, an 
announcer just announced the date for the referendum and read 
the seven-question questionnaire Duran-Ballen presented three 
days ago. The results of the referendum will decide whether 
another plebiscite will be held on 2 January 1995. This second 
plebiscite will be held to learn of the people's wishes 
regarding the summoning of a constituent assembly to make 
changes to the Constitution. 
  "Our most heartfelt wish is to make actual changes to the 
social, political, economic, and moral plans," President 
Duran-Ballen said during last week's radio and television 
network. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Chief of the Joint Staff Division General Pedro 
Concepcion de la Cruz Ocampos on 13 June denied that on 9 June 
during an unexpected meeting that was held at Armed Forces 
Headquarters members of the military had pressured the President 
and Commander in Chief Juan Carlos Wasmosy or handed him an 
ultimatum asking that he persuade congressmen and politicians to 
stop the "offenses" that are being hurled at the Armed Forces. 
"It is absolutely not true," he stressed. He also indicated that 
there is absolutely nothing to Wasmosy allegedly granting 
military men permission to take legal action against the law 
that bans servicemen on active duty from joining a political 
party. 
  Ocampos denied that influential generals are pressuring 
Wasmosy, demanding that he prevent the attacks that are being 
made against the institution by politicians and congressmen. 
"Those rumors are absolutely not true. They are totally false," 
he said firmly, when referring to the matter. 
  Asked about the rumors that some generals want to dissolve 
Congress, Ocampos stated that they are hot air. "They are just 
rumors. No one is thinking of doing that at this point. The 
people who start these rumors want to frighten or create an 
atmosphere of psychosis. The intention just does not exist," he 
said. 
  He added that he did not believe that Wasmosy could dissolve 
Congress because "all of us want to get the country off the 
ground. To do the contrary would be a step backward and it would 
have internal and external repercussions," he stressed. 
  He also indicated that he knew nothing at all about 
allegations that Wasmosy has granted permission to officers who 
want to take legal action against the law that temporarily bans 
servicemen on active duty from joining a political party. "This 
has been put on hold and there is nothing, absolutely nothing on 
this matter," he said. 
  Asked whether it was necessary for the officers to obtain 
permission from the commander in chief in order to take legal 
action, Ocampos answered: "I do not know. I do not have any 
grounds to answer that and I do not want to say something that 
is not true and thus compromise myself. I am not mixed up in 
this matter of politics and I do not want to discuss it because 
it is not something to my liking," he said. 
  Ocampos also indicated that it is very dangerous for the 
Armed Forces if servicemen on active duty take part in the 
activities of political parties. "In order to stop this 
situation cold, the commander in chief could issue a special 
edict that no one can meddle in party politics. I believe that 
all of us understand this and therefore we do not exceed the 
boundaries," he said.

  [Text] Army Commander General Lino Cesar Oviedo warned 
yesterday that "the military are the pillar and support for this 
incipient democracy." He said he will fight "for social justice 
in Congress so that veterans no longer receive a miserable 
salary from miserable people." 
  Oviedo yesterday made a speech at the Cerro Cora of Campo 
Grande Club during an homage paid to Chaco war veterans on the 
day Paraguayans commemorate the "Chaco Peace." Some 2,000 people 
attended the meeting, including a great number of politicians 
working for different Colorado Party factions. 
  The political tone of his speech was noticeable. Oviedo said 
in Guarani: "Everyone can speak, but no one can go around doing 
just anything he wants to. We will respect and see to it that 
others respect our Constitution. We will make laws that are in 
accordance with the Constitution." 
  To stress his position he said: "The military will continue 
to exist, despite those who do not like it, as the green uniform 
was born with the Paraguayan fatherland. We will not allow our 
flag to be used for personal purposes or for the subjugation of 
the people for the benefit of the few." Oviedo said: "The 
military are the pillar and support for this incipient 
democracy." 
  The military chief came out in defense of veterans, 
stressing 
that "we will struggle with you for justice in Congress, so that 
you no longer receive a miserable salary from miserable people." 
This was a direct reference to opposition legislators. He added: 
"If we are really human, we must be grateful." He promised to 
struggle in Congress "to achieve justice for our just and 
honorable veterans within the shortest possible period of time." 
  "If this Congress really represents the people, here 
(referring to Chaco war veterans) are the people's most 
deserving and meritorious members." Oviedo also mentioned Juan 
Carlos Wasmosy, because he, too, is the son of a veteran. 
  Oviedo characterized the opposition as "a bunch of cowards," 
adding that they are the ones who probably do not like the 
military. 
  Oviedo regretted the fact that "we are traveling among 
people 
who sow discord," and questioned the attitude of those who 
criticize his work and speak of a civilian and a military 
society. "Yes, we are traveling among people who sow discord, 
hate, animosity, and slander. We are doing little for our 
country in this way," Oviedo said. The military chief once again 
reiterated the need for social justice and unity "to overcome 
ignorance, health problems, and poverty."

  [Excerpt] "The APRA [American Revolutionary Popular 
Alliance] has no other course than to destroy the dictatorship." 
This was the unanimous response of all the APRA leaders who held 
an enthusiastic rally last night in the APRA headquarters to 
honor Agustin Mantilla Campos who was recently released from 
prison. 
  The leaders even proposed that after the current regime has 
been defeated, the first motion in Congress will be a formal 
accusation of "high treason" against President Alberto Fujimori 
and the military leaders supporting him. 
  With these expressions, the leaders discarded any possible 
rapprochement with the current government as was hinted by Alan 
Garcia unless great changes occur in the country. 
  The slogan sung by everyone at the rally yesterday was clear 
in this regard: "The APRA moves on without pacts or alliances." 
  The main speaker was Agustin Mantilla who energetically said 
that they would never accept a pact with a government that 
imposed a policy of hunger and misery. 
  He added: "In the 1995 elections, our task will be to take 
the dictator out of the palace and lock him up in prison." 
  Regarding the possibility of a concensus candidacy, Mantilla 
was clear when he said that, according to the thoughts of APRA 
founder Haya de la Torre, a political democracy cannot exist 
without an economic democracy. 
  He said: "We should not fall into a limping democracy with 
hunger and misery just because we want to come out of the 
dictatorship." 
  He added: The struggle is also against neoliberalism, 
against 
the auctioning of the country, against the rich who are getting 
richer. 
  Addressing the rally, which filled the auditorium, Mantilla 
recognized the need for the APRA to renew its program and 
government platform. 
  He said: We must look at the new world events and the real 
situation of the country. 
  But never--he said--abandon the idea that the state must 
continue to act in the national life. 
  At the end of his speech and in the midst of shouts from his 
supporters, Mantilla asked the party militants for more work, 
effort, and sacrifice to be successful in the 1995 elections. 
  Also, leader Jorge del Castillo clarified that Alan Garcia 
in 
an interview with a foreign television station never spoke of 
pacts or alliances. 
  He said that Garcia referred to the possibility of dialogue 
on issues such as misery or subversion. 
  He added: "He never mentioned an alliance with the 
dictatorship, his comments were general and some media tried to 
distort them." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by Juan F. De La Puente Mejia] </F>
  [Text] "Operation Aries" has, among other things, proved 
that Upper Huallaga some months ago became the last great 
stronghold of the Shining Path [SL] and that, as in most of the 
Peruvian jungle, it is still too early to talk about a "post-SL 
era." 
  One of the first lessons learned from the events in April is 
that the current antisubversive strategy must be reviewed. The 
strategy that has been most effective--which weakened the 
peoples' support for the SL and prevented its infiltration in 
the towns--was devised by General Arciniega between 1989 and 
1990. This strategy simultaneously sought to militarily defeat 
the terrorists and to restore the confidence of the people in 
the state. This strategy recovered the initiative, give military 
actions a bit of an edge, and thus changed the course of the 
war; it gave up the idea of repressing coca plantations and 
isolating the civilian population--especially coca growing 
peasants--from the SL; it began assistance programs and 
encouraged coca growers and the inhabitants of Uchiza and 
Tocache to become organized. 
  The strategy used throughout "Operation Aries," seems to be 
a 
more schematic and less creative application of the strategy 
that has been implemented--with the exception of Arciniega's 
time--nationwide. Its objectives seem to be exclusively military 
and nonpolitical, leaving little room for civilians, with the 
exception of their participation in the assistance programs. The 
people do not understand why security forces appear one time 
with foodstuffs and medical assistance and another time on an 
operation that violates their rights. 
  Since the start of terrorist actions in Upper Huallaga, the 
antiterrorist struggle has overlooked the fact that this 
territory is substantially different to that in other emergency 
zones. Violence continues in Upper Huallaga--unlike in the 
mountains and in coastal regions--due to endemic poverty, the 
concentration of wealth, and the lack of development. The 
peoples' need for protection from abuse by drug traffickers and 
the struggle against a government obsessed with eradicating coca 
plantations helped the Shining Path to grow strong. What the SL 
saw as "rebellion," the people interpreted as "protection." 
  Likewise, it would be interesting to assess the results of a 
military operation that was described as an orderly offensive 
when in truth it was a counteroffensive. 
  It was obvious, and reported in various forms, that during 
the past few months the SL has been engaged in a desperate 
offensive and a geographic relocation, a fact that was not 
acknowledged or wrongly assessed by the military command of the 
zone. Following its most recent nationwide meeting--last 
February--the SL began a nationwide offensive on 1 April with 
its greatest expectations centered in Upper Huallaga. 
  The same sources stated that between 1 and 6 April the Armed 
and Police Forces lost many agents due to SL ambushes, 
commenting that "Operation Aries" was a hasty and poorly planned 
action. This explains why the SL "Red Sea" column easily eluded 
the military barrier, why no significant arrests took place at 
the theater of operations, and why the military command made the 
great mistake of holding the International Red Cross 
Organization responsible for the terrorists' escape. 
  This is explained in the fact that "Operation Aries" had 
purely military objectives. 
  The following factors were not taken into account when the 
Cuchara, Primavera, and Yanajanca valley's were surrounded and 
when the towns scattered throughout the 80,000 hectares were 
bombed (with rocket fire): 
  First, that territory has for a long time rejected the SL 
units and settlers have refused to cooperate with them. Second, 
that territory has been covered by the "Red Sea" column which 
came to intimidate the settlers. Third, that territory is of 
political interest to the government and the other institutions 
that are carrying out projects to replace coca. It is also the 
place where Enaco [National Coca Enterprise] is campaigning to 
legalize the illegal coca plantations, and these initiatives 
require the confidence and cooperation of the civilian 
population for their success. 
  The second problem that transcends the defeat of the SL is 
the endemic lack of democratic institutions, and the profound 
economic, and social backwardness of the zone. The people blame 
successive governments for the lack of democracy and 
development, these governments promised great projects but did 
not carry them out and only remember the existence of the zone 
every time there is an antidrug or an antisubversive operation. 
The people recognize, however, that small progress to combat the 
endemic evils of the region have been made since 1990. 
  It would be a mistake, therefore, to fail to appreciate the 
few civilians who live in Upper Huallaga and to use them 
exclusively to form peasant defense patrols. An antisubversive 
strategy that destroys what little government and democracy 
there is there could achieve a military victory in the 
short-term but it would leave the next governments with their 
hands tied when they try to manage that region which is part of 
the large Peruvian jungle of which it is said a great deal of 
our future depends. It is necessary to consider that in the 
post-SL era, the lack of a development model to successfully 
replace the drug trafficking economy with the state economy will 
again be a reason for confrontation and demand. It would be 
risky if the legacy of the Armed Forces amounts to nothing more 
than simply arming peasant defense patrols. 
  To give an example of the current situation of the towns and 
cities of Upper Huallaga, we should look at Uchiza and Tocache, 
which were the magic cities of the past and always full of life. 
Today they have electricity for just a few hours a day, their 
streets are not paved, and health care and education are poor. 
Until a few years ago, the association of parents in high 
schools gave "allowances" of food and housing to graduated 
teachers who agreed to stay in the zone despite the dangers. 
  Aucayacu is not connected to the Mantaro Electrical Plant, 
it 
has thermal equipment like Uchiza and Tocache. Its streets are 
not paved and the highway to Tingo Maria, which was once paved, 
is unrecognizable--the 300 or so ditches opened by the SL some 
years ago have been filled but not paved. 
  Tingo Maria is the worst case of neglect. Even though it is 
the capital of the province, the state has invested very little 
in this town where 50 percent of the shantytowns have no 
electricity and 30 percent of its streets are not paved. 
  Following the heated municipal elections which many believe 
were won by Ramon Julca, the people had great hopes of Mayor 
Loyseth Reategui Lopez's administration. But Tingo Maria 
inhabitants were disappointed in less than a year. It turns out 
that the worst municipal administration in Peruvian history has 
spurned the people and handed over all its power to the 
military. Reategui's recent statements justifying cases of abuse 
and denying the violation of human rights and dubious actions by 
her administration prompted the creation a few days ago of the 
Leoncio Prado Defense and Development Front, headed by Guanilo 
Lopez. 
  The Front has protested over the signing of a huge contract 
between the Fonavi [National Housing Fund] and Tecnicos 
Ejecutores S.A. The deal is endorsed by Reategui and will 
supposedly provide electricity to the shantytowns. The funny 
thing is that, after the contract was announced, it became 
apparent that the shantytowns will benefit least while Tingo 
Maria, which already has nine electricity supply lines, will be 
further electrified at a very high cost that will be paid by its 
neighbors. 
  Guanilo Lopez has warned of a possible fraud and pointed out 
that while the electrification of the rest of the country is 
funded by the Treasury through Foncodes [National Compensation 
and Social Development Fund] or the Ministry of the Presidency, 
in Tingo Maria--a town plagued by poverty and fear--development 
costs the earth. Lopez stated that this contract sounds even 
more suspicious when one considers that another enterprise, 
Orion S.A., quoted for the same job for half the price. 
  One of the most vulnerable towns is Tingo Maria, due to the 
constant overflowing of the Huallaga River. It has not had the 
municipality's support to create a Civil Defense office. On the 
contrary. According to the Front, donations by the National 
Civil Defense following the floods early this year have 
disappeared. The list of irregularities also mentions the 
over-invoicing of the roof of the market place (by 100,000 
soles), the paving of airstrips, and the hiring of enterprises 
that belong to councilmen, which is prohibited under the penal 
code. 
  Nevertheless, the mayor continues on her controversial path 
and reacts to any complaint by recalling Huanuco's campaign to 
become annexed to Ucayali. Sectors of the local media maintain 
this would be even worse, that Ucayali will not worry about 
Tingo Maria if currently it does nothing about Aguaytia which is 
much nearer to Pucallpa. Many believe the only solution is for 
the government to take care of Tingo Maria. 
  The situation in rural areas is no better. Rural 
investments are limited and, despite some achievements by the 
Upper Huallaga Development Project (PEAH), the main objective 
has failed: to broaden the agricultural border. 
  The main problems facing agricultural development are the 
transfer of technology and the successful diversification toward 
the eradication of coca plantations. 
  But things are not that easy: Decades of coca plantations, 
which hardly require any technology, have created a mentality 
that prefers easy crops and despises technology. Despite its 
potential, the farming sector in Upper Huallaga uses less 
technology than anywhere else in the country. 
  The same occurs with the coca replacement. Although it has 
been proven that traditional crops (cocoa, corn, fruit, rice, 
and others) would be best to replace the coca plantations, most 
implemented projects tend to try other crops (silkworms, the 
luisa plant [small plant grown in Peru for medicinal purposes]) 
which are not working. Among the identified problems in the 
development of the rural sector are the lack of markets, 
technical assistance, and product promotion. 
  To meet Upper Huallaga's demands, the government would have 
to change its attitude toward that region. It has been proven 
that the replacement of coca plantations and neoliberalism are 
contradictory. 
  The SL began the year by consolidating a strategy it has 
been 
using for months. It involves the regular use, for the second 
time, of the corridor from Monzon Valley (in Upper Huallaga) to 
the northern mountain region in Huanuco Department and from 
there to the provinces east and south of Ancash; at the same 
time they moved their forces north, toward Lower Huallaga 
(Campanilla, Juanjui, Bellavista, and Picota, in San Martin 
Department) and east, toward Padre Abad Province (Ucayali 
Department). At the same time, its Huanuco Zone Committee was 
elaborating a plan that has clear objectives for Huanuco 
University and the shantytowns that surround this city. 
  This movement is the alleged result of undeniable facts: the 
SL's relationship with the rural population of Upper Huallaga is 
coming to an end and in many zones (for example the pockets near 
Aucayacu) it is openly rejected. Other factors include the SL's 
failed attempt to administer the coca economy, a substantial 
reduction in the rural population due to the crisis affecting 
the coca production, the shifting of the drug trade to the north 
of San Martin Department, the Central Jungle, and Madre de Dios, 
and the harsh blows by the Armed Forces over the past few years. 
  At the height of its power, members of the SL took over 
small coca producing peasant villages scattered throughout the 
Huallaga Valley where they imposed their law and their 
organization. They appointed delegates and established a "local 
force." They appointed those responsible for logistics, 
military, and political affairs; they issued rules and punished 
those who violated them. The town that had been "taken 
over"--more often than not with the consent of its 
inhabitants--was revisited several times and became an SL 
recruiting center. 
  It seems that the villages are now disavowing SL impositions 
and it looks like relations between SL and the civilian 
population are no longer cordial. The strict SL moral codes, 
which generally do not apply to SL members themselves, are no 
longer welcome. The so-called "local forces" and the 
"grass-roots forces" are experiencing a true crisis. 
  In this new stage, SL has decided to strengthen its 
so-called 
"main force," that is, the mobile columns that make up the 
People's Guerrilla Army (EGP). The most important of these 
(comprising 120 to 150 men) is the "Red Sea" battalion; another, 
comprising 60 to 70 men, operates in Pucayacu--a town near 
Aucayacu--where they killed four people, among them the 
president of the local Mothers Club and a Foncodes [National 
Compensation and Social Development Fund] promoter. On 17 and 18 
May, when an "armed stoppage" was staged, SL columns were 
spotted near the Padre Luyando district and between Crespo, 
Castillo, and Aucayacu. In spite of this, the "armed stoppage" 
was a failure. 
  This reversal could be fatal for the SL. By resorting to its 
columns, SL is entering a field it does not dominate, that of 
large-scale guerrilla warfare. So far, SL has preferred to 
perpetrate simple ambushes or bomb attacks, killing civilians or 
military personnel, and attacking towns that have no police or 
military protection. There have been very few instances of 
clashes over the past 14 years (the takeover of the Huamanga and 
Vilcashuaman jail; the attack on the Uchiza police post; and the 
attack on the Madre Mia military base in Upper Huallaga, among 
others). It is well-known that in its creed, SL puts heroism 
before military training; dedication before sophistication. To 
counter this disadvantage, the SL has been forced to violate one 
of the most sacred rules of "President Gonzalo" [top SL leader 
Abimael Guzman]: "Do not buy weapons, seize them from the enemy." 
  Everything indicates that the SL has become modernized in 
the 
Upper Huallaga area and now has sophisticated weapons; this is 
proven at the military command's press appearances. Until 
recently, we saw shotguns, booby traps, and handguns. Now they 
carry FAL [Light Automatic Rifles] and RPG [antitank grenades], 
Instalaza rockets, fragmentation grenades, etc. 
  This is not the only rule the SL members in Upper Huallaga 
are violating: Compared with their traditional ideological 
anachronisms, their current actions have no political meaning 
and they are acting more like bandits. An example of this is 
their incursion in Pucayacu on 14 May: The president of the 
local Mothers Club was killed "for accepting food assistance 
from imperialism" yet later...SL members carried off 3 metric 
tons of the same food supplies. 
  Stern nom de guerres alluding to the Maoist tradition have 
yielded to nicknames and aliases. Among these are "Chapulin," 
"Bigotes," "El Manco," "Yersi," "Napo," "Pepe," "Jeshuco," 
"Michel," "Anuje," "Taruca," "Chocolate," "Cucharita," "Popeye," 
etc. None of these would suggest to us Peruvian Maoist 
combatants. 
  Villagers have reported that one of them, "El Manco," who is 
believed to be the leader of the "Red Sea" column, is known for 
his blood-thirstiness with his victims. Many legends have been 
created about him. The most incredible removes him from the 
political world and places him in the world of black magic: 
Villagers say he made a pact with the devil who demanded one of 
his arms in exchange for immortality. This is why he remains 
unscathed in all the clashes. 
  Everything seems to indicate it will be hard for SL to 
relocate itself in other areas and to base its actions on its 
"main force." Moreover, it experienced a serious defeat in 
Huanuco over its plans for the "Hermilio Valdizan University. 
The arrests made in the last three months are believed to have 
seriously damaged the party and the "party organizations." 
[quotation marks as published] 
  Local experts have said these difficulties follow a 
slackening of internal discipline. For example, it has been 
reported that Huanuco SL members commemorated Mao's 100th 
anniversary on 26 December in the town of Vichayoto (15 km from 
Huanuco) with such a huge party that the following day scheduled 
operations had to be canceled: The local main square was not 
taken over. This resulted in the sparing of the lives of Mayor 
Luzmila Temple, local regional government president Lucia 
Shinsato, and Provincial Prosecutor Carlos Tucato, who were 
supposed to have been assassinated. 
  In Huanuco, arrests have followed the detention of German 
Campos Mallqui. He was arrested in January and numerous 
documents were seized from him. His delayed repentance resulted 
in the arrest of others, including some university professors 
who are not directly involved in seditious activities. In light 
of this, the proposed SL takeover of the Huanuco University 
seems more and more unlikely.

<F P=106> ["Highlights" of Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu's remarks </F>
during one-hour meeting with reporter Emilio Cazala; place and 
date not given] 
  [Excerpts] We have always favored the concentric circles 
policy: a region, the continent, and the rest of the world. In 
Uruguay, we have for many years supported a midpoint policy, 
that is, agreement with our two large neighbors -- with the 
active participation of Bolivia and Paraguay -- to transform the 
River Plate Basin into a geopolitical structure, allowing 
Uruguay to assume its role as the River Plate Basin's export 
gate. 
  Uruguay has been described as a "hinge," a country in the 
lower abdomen of South America that may be the most effective 
renderer of services and may demonstrate competitive advantages 
over its huge neighbors -- Brazil and Argentina. 
  Within the integration drive, Argentina has bilateral and 
quadrilateral relations. Bilaterally, we have our economic 
agreements, our political agreements on border cooperation, our 
joint River Plate statute, the common River Plate seashore since 
1974, our Uruguay River with its dams and bridges that involve 
every aspect of integration -- physical, transportation, and 
electric power integration. 
  This is complemented by trade integration. In our opinion, 
integration involves bilateral agreements, basically through 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. This shows that both 
Uruguay and Argentina must gradually meet the other partners 
within a strategy that will allow us to increase understanding 
rather than misunderstanding, increase complementation rather 
than disagreement, and increase competitiveness rather than 
exclusion from participation in our joint efforts. This 
integration involves complementation not subordination. This is 
the idea we are promoting. 
  With this idea of bilateral projects, complemented by 
quadrilateral projects and a hemispheric projection, we began to 
increase the dynamics of our relationship in issues involving 
common interests, especially the River Plate. Uruguay has 
specifically established as a priority the dredging of the 
Martin Garcia Channel. Why? Because it involves active 
participation in a common river, because it increases the 
dynamics of rendering services in the River Plate Basin area, 
and because it confirms the legal obligations of the five 
countries that make up the Waterway Treaty. This treaty has yet 
to be implemented. It has been partially approved in Argentina 
and Brazil. Private and public sectors are already developing a 
number of initiatives and projects, clearly showing the 
implementation of the enterprise. 
  Bearing in mind the waterway project, we consider the Martin 
Garcia Channel and the reactivation of Nueva Palmira, the 
waterway terminal, to be a priority. 
  The waterway project is not just of interest to Uruguay. It 
is important and we wanted to mention it the way we explained it 
to Argentina. Not just Uruguay, or Nueva Palmira, or navigation 
linked to Uruguay's interests will benefit. The idea is a better 
rendering of services in the field of river transportation, 
involving maintenance costs, transportation costs, and enhanced 
navigation security. 
  It involves a more effective rendering of services that will 
allow increased demand, both in quantity and in quality. This 
point was raised by Uruguay. Therefore, Uruguay considers the 
Martin Garcia issue a priority in its geopolitical stance. We 
experienced problems, comings and goings, and tense negotiations 
for many months prior to the exchange of notes in June 1993 and 
now the signing of notes, calling the bid and the filing of 
specifications for the Martin Garcia channel dredging and the 
commencement of this project by the end of the year. 
  We also have the management of common resources, like the 
common fishing zones and everything pertaining to fishing policy 
with Argentina. Uruguay is experiencing a special situation; 
through a fishing agreement that was signed a few days ago it is 
now forbidden to catch medium-size hake in this zone so as not 
to plunder this resource which migrates south and which has been 
exploited by Argentina and by the EU. All this has been raised 
by Uruguay, with concern, firmly, but respectfully because these 
are common resources that must be managed. We have raised these 
issues at the United Nations, the EU, and at the bilateral level. 
  We have the river transportation system, in which we must 
define how the flag system will operate in the bilateral area; 
we also have the passenger transportation system, which is 
important for Uruguay, for which we sought and found the 
solution that was signed with Argentina on 3 June. We have a 
river transportation system in which a long-standing 
disagreement between two ways of thinking is going to be 
resolved. 
  This issue is also linked to the Uruguay River's 
navigability. This is another aspect of our border cooperation 
policy, and we must remember that our borders with Argentina 
involve rivers. The situation is not like that with Brazil, with 
which we do not share any navigable rivers, and this gives rise 
to other dynamics and a different situation. With Argentina, we 
share a river that unites us, supplies us with resources, and 
allows us to cooperate in the fields of transportation of 
merchandise and passengers; tourism, which today represents 
Uruguay's main source of foreign exchange; and energy production. 
  Salto Grande is one of the most important hydroelectric 
power 
plants in the region. It involves production, sale, 
coordination, and cooperation in the energy field between the 
two countries. The river will consolidate our cooperation and 
the supply of joint services. The Uruguay River and the Salto 
Grande project involve water and energy. Navigability of the 
Uruguay River is important because it serves as an outlet for 
distant export centers in Argentina and in Uruguay. Nueva 
Palmira is the last stop along the Paraguay-Parana waterway, a 
project that involves five nations. Dredging the Martin Garcia 
Channel is a contribution to navigation safety and 
modernization. Another joint effort involves the river 
transportation of passengers using a clear flagging system. 
Fishing is a very important resource for the country. The 
preservation of the environment, particularly the ocean front, 
concerns the entire world, not just our two countries. These 
projects involve joint efforts by both countries and the search 
for common elements for cooperation. These common aspects are 
characteristics of a more interdependent and global world where 
nationalities consolidate and project themselves into 
integration and cooperation projects. 
  The old system of isolating nationalism is being replaced by 
a dynamic nationalism involving cooperation and coordination. 
The true expression of nationalism for our peoples will be 
prosperity. 
  This prosperity should not be an expression of egoism, it 
should be an expression of coordination and reciprocal 
concessions for our mutual benefit. 
  This is the model of our relations with Argentina. We talk 
about the issue at all forums when we refer to subregional or 
regional aspects. But we also have a hemispheric projection. 
  Our geopolitical relations involve Brazil, Argentina, 
Paraguay, and Chile. It is a trade integration plan that assumes 
integration and openness are compatible. We suggest an 
administrated openness in which Mercosur acts as the cornerstone 
of production and integration. When we ask Argentina, Brazil, 
and Paraguay to consolidate this effort, to respect our 
obligations, and to advance, it is because we believe in the 
process. It is precisely through credibility that we will 
strengthen our internal relations. 
  We know integration in general is full of unfulfilled goals, 
but we do not want this. We are sometimes confronted with 
problems that place national interests against group interests. 
In this case it is more important to stress the national 
interest even though the group will have difficulties, because 
this is the only way to maintain credibility and respectability. 
  Consistency, openness, and professional attitudes are the 
three pillars of our foreign policies. We project them in our 
bilateral relations with Argentina and we project them in our 
multilateral relations through Mercosur. [passage omitted] 
  We also project ourselves politically into our hemisphere, 
in 
a world with a single world power. We have dynamic relations 
with the United States. We want to integrate gradually with them 
economically, through Mercosur. But we also want the United 
States to become integrated into a more balanced concept of 
international law, particularly in aspects that are important to 
us, like the new concept of hemispheric security. Uruguay and 
Argentina have expressed their desire that nonintervention, self 
determination, and peaceful solutions to controversies should 
become unchangeable principles. We believe these principles 
should be established tenets, not because we are conservatives 
but because they represent the essence of respect for countries' 
identity and a valuable tool in handling political relations 
between stronger and weaker nations. 
  Uruguay, we have always said, is geographically, militarily, 
and economically a lot smaller than Argentina or Brazil. But the 
principle of the sovereign equality of nations makes us as 
strong as any other nation at the time of defending those 
principles. We want to see great caution regarding hemispheric 
security so as to avoid being the instrument of other country's 
policies. This is very important because it gives us credibility 
and respectability. We handle these issues with clarity and 
frankness and the Argentine Government understands and accepts 
our position. 
  All these elements show Uruguay is integrating its foreign 
policy and has privileged bilateral relations with Argentina, 
Brazil and Paraguay through Mercosur. Uruguay is also 
integrating its policies with the Southern Cone, and naturally 
with Chile. 
  There has been a qualitative change in our relations with 
Argentina over the past few months. Difficulties are being 
gradually solved with a lot of flexibility. This quality has its 
maximum expression in the Argentine president and the Argentine 
Foreign Ministry. They have a vision like that of former 
Argentine President Juan Domingo Peron when we signed the Rio de 
La Plata Borders Treaty which, beyond any doubt, contributed 
greatly to the juridical security of our relations. It created 
the idea that we should share a resource that belongs to both 
countries, setting aside the idea that the stronger party is 
always right. [passage omitted] 
  Integration today is the projection of the idea and the 
thought that our participation is not done in detriment of our 
identity, but precisely to strengthen it. The fact that we are 
working on integration projects--including some project that 
might have an importance beyond our borders--does not mean we 
are losing our Uruguayan nationalism. Our origin, and the 
effects of our culture, family, education -- and even the 
strategic projection of our future -- are reflected in our 
reality. 
  Europe, the continent that bestowed upon us a series of 
positive cultural elements and even religious traditions, is 
very distant when we begin to discuss trade interests. 
  When we defended Uruguayan interests during the GATT round 
we 
realized that European interests, not solidarity with Latin 
America, always prevailed. 
  That is their legitimate right and their legitimate 
position. 
When we defend our positions we must place limits on our 
romantic ideas and emotional reactions. This is why we view the 
region and our relations with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Bolivia as our great priority. We are a region, a subregion, 
with the same origin, feelings, and interests. These three 
elements unite us. Regrettably, the intensity of these feelings 
is sometimes used by groups that seek privileges. These elements 
must by administered by governments, the people, and by those 
interests. The short-term success of those interests usually 
means the defeat of medium-term state positions and strategies.

<F P=106> [Article by Lucio Vaz] </F>
  [Text] The bloc of Protestant Church congressmen plans to 
increase their number from 25 to 50 in this year's elections. 
The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God alone hopes to elect 
12 deputies. 
  With about 25 million followers, according to evaluations by 
their congressional bloc, the Protestant Church has the 
potential to elect an even greater number of deputies and 
senators than that. Not all of the Protestant Church sectors 
have, however, a centralized hierarchy like the Universal Church. 
  This religious group, headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, chooses 
its candidates through a system resembling the "democratic 
centralism" employed by orthodox leftist organizations. 
  The Bishops Council, which is comprised of eight to 10 
bishops, holds a national meeting and chooses the candidates for 
each state. Their faithful (nearly 1 million) are instructed to 
vote only for those candidates. 
  This centralizing system is also partially adopted by the 
other Pentecostal churches, such as the Assembly of God, the 
Church of God, and the House of Blessings. The difference is 
that in these religious groups decisions are made in each state 
or city. 
  The historical divisions of the Protestant Church, such as 
Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist, and Lutheran, do not indicate 
any preferred candidates. Clergymen who choose to follow a 
political career, however, end up being supported by the 
faithful. 
  Both the historical and the Pentecostal Protestants reject 
political parties. They share, however, an interest in topics 
linked to the family, such as abortion, divorce, homosexuality, 
and prostitution. 
  The evangelical Christians follow the principle that 
"Christians vote for Christians," independently of any party to 
which the member of the Protestant faith is linked. 
  Of the current group of 21 Protestant deputies, 15 have 
already changed parties after having being elected. In the 
Senate, the bloc has four members. 
  The structure of the churches can be used to help elect 
Protestant candidates. The Universal Church has a television 
network (Record) and radio stations in several states. 
  During the electoral campaign, the clergymen of several of 
these groups become voluntary campaign workers. The newspapers 
that circulate among the faithful are also used to disseminate 
news about the candidates. 
  Deputy Luiz Moreira (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia 
State], of the Universal Church, says that all the clergymen of 
their 160 churches in Bahia State will be his voluntary campaign 
workers. "We will still have the support of these churches' 
workers," he said. 
  Moreira asserts that the clergymen comply strictly with the 
instructions of the Bishops Council. "Our hierarchy is 
centralized," he explained. 
  Aware of the votes available in Bahia State, the Universal 
Church has proposed a candidate for federal deputy and two for 
state deputies. 
  The other religious groups are not as well organized. PFL 
Deputy Arolde de Oliveira (RJ) [Rio de Janeiro] asserts that the 
2 million Protestant faithful of Rio de Janeiro could have 
elected up to 20 deputies in 1990. 
  The excessive number of candidates from these churches, 
however, allowed only seven of them to be elected. "The votes 
of the Protestant faithful increased the support for the other 
party candidates, and ended up getting non-Protestant people 
elected," the deputy analyzed. 
  One of the things Protestant congressmen have in common is 
their support of the government. Arolde de Oliveira explains: 
"We want the freedom to disseminate our ideas, to address the 
people in public squares, to have radio and television stations." 
  The Protestant congressmen's support of then President Jose 
Sarney ensured them radio and television stations. These 
congressmen also defended a five-year presidential mandate for 
President Sarney at the 1988 Constitutional Assembly.

  [Text] The AEVB (Brazilian Evangelical Association) has 
issued a 10-point leaflet to advise evangelical voters, and in 
August it will hold a debate with the four most popular 
candidates. The leaflet warns of the possibility that some 
evangelical leaders could try to influence voters' decisions, 
and upholds the moral standards of the candidates. 
  The leaflet states: "No evangelical voter should feel bad 
because he disagrees with his pastor or spiritual leader." The 
text states that the vote for president should be based on 
government programs. It also condemns the spreading of rumors, 
such as those against Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva during the 1989 
elections. 
  The leaflet approves of the religious vote. If the voter 
feels that he or she identifies with the candidate, but not with 
his party, the leaflet recommends: "It is suggested that even 
so, a vote of support be given to our fellow believer as long as 
he qualifies for the post." 
  The AEVB is identified as the most progressive sector of the 
evangelical community. It opposes the National Ministers 
Council, which is linked to the IURD (Universal Church of the 
Kingdom of God) headed by Bishop Edir Macedo, and is a dissident 
faction of the Assembly of God. 
  The IURD rejects Lula. The last issue of FOLHA UNIVERSAL 
carries an article stating that the PT [Workers Party] upholds 
the legalization of abortion and homosexuality. The article 
said that the PT "is the product of the Roman clergy, and is at 
the service of the interests that have always prevailed in the 
history of the Roman Catholic Church." 
  IURD state Deputy Paulo Cesar De Velasco says the church 
intends to support one candidate. He commented: "It will not 
be Lula, nor will it be Brizola." Quercia is the only candidate 
praised by De Velasco: "His running mate [Iris Resende] is 
evangelical and uses language that can be understood by the 
people." De Velasco believes Fernando Henrique Cardoso is 
"inconsistent" from the religious viewpoint.

  [Text] Orestes Quercia (PMDB) [Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party] and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) [Workers 
Party] are the two presidential candidates who have taken the 
most concrete steps toward attracting evangelical voters. 
  Quercia chose an Evangelical -- Iris de Araujo Machado -- as 
his running mate for the presidency. The PT campaign has a 
national evangelical committee charged with organizing pro-Lula 
evangelical committees in every capital city of the nation. 
  The PT candidate is determined not to repeat the error he 
committed in 1989, when he lost most of the evangelical votes to 
Collor. All the presidential candidates regard the evangelical 
group -- consisting of 25 million people, 13 million of whom are 
voters -- as one of their priorities. 
  The campaign that is least focused on the Evangelicals is 
that of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the PSDB [Brazilian Social 
Democracy Party] presidential candidate. 
  Deputy Lezio Sathler, a Presbyterian and the only PSDB 
evangelical member serving in Congress, said: "I have noticed a 
lack of action in that area. Cardoso must urgently shift his 
attention to the Evangelicals." 
  Cardoso has the support of Deputy Salatiel Carvalho (PP-PE) 
[Popular Party-Pernambuco State], a member of the Assembly of 
God, who coordinated Fernando Collor's campaign among 
Evangelicals in 1989. 
  Carvalho has not shown, however, great enthusiasm about this 
job. He said: "I am going to ask for votes for Cardoso to 
comply with my party's decision." 
  PDT [Democratic Labor Party] candidate Leonel Brizola is 
well 
accepted in some segments of the evangelical community, 
especially in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. 
  PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] candidate Esperidiao Amin, 
who has already started to meet with Evangelicals, plans to 
intensify these meetings. 
  Lula's attempt to strengthen his ties with the Evangelicals 
dates back to before the start of this electoral campaign. 
Presbyterian Pastor Caio Fabio, president of AEVB (Brazilian 
Evangelical Association), said: "For two years, I have met 
almost every month with Lula to pray and to read the Bible." 
  In 1989 there were widespread rumors that, if elected, Lula 
would shut down all evangelical churches. The Universal Church 
of the Kingdom of God went so far as to compare Lula with the 
devil. 
  Evangelical leaders note that Lula has managed to reduce 
resistance to his name, but not to the point of earning the 
majority of evangelical voters. 
  Silva Malafaia, pastor of the Assembly of God church, said: 
"The PT ideology upholds materialistic views that are contrary 
to ours." 
  Salatiel Carvalho also opposes Lula. He said: "I will ask 
for votes for any candidate running against Lula in a runoff." 
  Most evangelical leaders believe that Quercia's decision to 
pick Iris de Araujo as his candidate for vice president will 
influence evangelical voters. 
  Iris Araujo said: "The fact that a sister of the faith will 
be on the ticket will have a greater effect on evangelical 
voters." She said that an evangelical candidate will attract 
evangelical voters. She added: "We have to expand our field of 
action to change somewhat the materialistic mentality that 
prevails in today's world."

  [Text] The evangelical community is gradually getting rid 
of its conservative stigma, and is beginning to open up to 
evangelical leaders identified with the left. The most recent 
phenomenon is the creation of the MEPS (Socialist Popular 
Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico Popular Socialista], 
which is linked with the PPS [Popular Socialist Party], the 
former Brazilian Communist Party. 
  The MEPS was approved at the national convention of the PPS, 
which elected evangelical members to run in the elections for 
the PPS. One of them is Luis Cavalcante, candidate for state 
deputy for Sao Paulo State. 
  "The PT [Workers Party] is very close to the Catholic 
Church. 
That is why I have come to the PPS," Cavalcante said. He added 
that the PPS has evangelical candidates in Rio de Janeiro and 
Sao Paulo States. 
  The increase of progressive members identified with the left 
can be explained as a reaction to the behavior of evangelical 
congressmen during the Constituent Assembly and at the 
impeachment of Collor. 
  The MEP (Popular Evangelical Movement) [Movimento Evangelico 
Popular] was created following Collor's election. "Our 
objective is to encourage evangelicals to participate in social 
movements," said Reverend Robinson Cavalcante, who supports Lula. 
  According to Reverend Cavalcante, the MEP encourages its 
members to join leftist parties and the CUT [Sole Workers 
Center]. Evangelical interest in participating in social 
movements has increased in the past 10 years, Cavalcante said. 
  Reverend Oneide Bobison, who also supports Lula, mentioned 
another factor that contributes to the increase of progressive 
members. "Young clergymen prefer leftist and center-left 
parties."

  [Text] During an evening debate with the Jewish community 
on 13 June, PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva said he, like the Jews, is a "survivor." 
He said: "I survived the starvation war in the northeastern 
region." He included something new in his government proposal, 
saying: "I will negotiate the foreign debt directly with the 
presidents." He added: "I will contact U.S. President Bill 
Clinton because I know he is more sensitive to the social 
situation resulting from our debt." He criticized the current 
Brazilian foreign policy, saying: "We are important enough to 
play the international power game, yet all we do is run after 
the ball." 
  Lula and Jose Dirceu, the PT candidate for the governorship 
of Sao Paulo State, kicked off a series of candidate debates 
sponsored by the Sao Paulo Israeli Federation at the Hebrew 
Club. Progressive Renewal Party presidential candidate 
Esperidiao Amin and Luiz Antonio de Medeiros, the Popular Party 
candidate for state governor, will participate on 27 June. 
Brazilian Social Democracy Party candidates Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso and Mario Covas are scheduled for 8 August, and Orestes 
Quercia and Barros Munhoz for 22 August.

<F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo at the </F>
closing ceremony of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in 
Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 15 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] His Majesty, President of Portugal, heads of state 
and governments of Ibero-American countries, foreign ministers, 
representatives of international organizations, members of 
delegations, ladies and gentlemen: 
  In 1594, exactly 400 years ago, Bautista Antonelli, a 
military engineer in the service of Philip II began constructing 
the wall and fortifications that would protect this city from 
the appetites of the pirates and filibusters that marauded the 
Caribbean during those times. For two centuries Cartagena de 
Indias was fortified until it became the architectonic patrimony 
of mankind we know today. Fortunately, as time passed its use 
has changed, and its defensive walls are now a warm refuge for 
evening lovers. In this enchanting city, the memory of Fernando 
Claver becomes a permanent lesson of philantrophy. In this 
city, Bolivar dreamed of a single America as the epicenter of 
liberty and equality. Here, Cesar Gaviria, your delighted host 
who for the last time has attended this Ibero-American summit as 
Colombian president, has been honored to share with you the 
commitment, responsibility, and dignified task of molding the 
present and near future of our nations. This task can be no 
other than advancing as brothers in building a new political, 
social, and economic order capable of eliminating inequality, 
eradicating violence, and promoting culture, solidarity, 
respect, and knowledge to create a new Ibero-American man proud 
of what he is, what he has, and what he can obtain in the future. 
  This has been an inspiring and pleasant task, which we have 
all fulfilled for the benefit of our compatriots, without 
forgetting that this benefit is only possible if each one of our 
Ibero-American brothers, their children, and grandchildren who 
also receive their share. 
  Our people's interdependent independence [as heard] was 
conceived as the visionary paradox that would make our dream a 
reality and is now approaching the millennium. Not in vain, 
through the centuries our cultures have acquired a pragmatism 
characterized by unselfishness, as well as the vision and 
capacity to excel in that that we call civilization. 
  A new era, which offers great possibilities, demands 
struggling tirelessly, maintaining the capacity to listen, and 
also the determination and firmness to make ourselves heard, 
until we have finally made an overwhelming reality which not 
long ago was just a fantasy. As participants mandated by our 
peoples, we are drawing the map that will determine the future 
of Ibero-America, which we have sketched with an imaginary line 
that begins in Guadalajara, and continues to Madrid, Salvador de 
Bahia, and Cartagena de Indias. Now, that line will extend to 
the Southern Cross, to Buenos Aires, the site of our next summit 
and will project itself beyond that point. 
  With your permission, my dear friends, I would like to 
express what may seem a digression, but is not. I cannot forget 
for a moment my compatriots, the Paez Indians, who live in Cauca 
and Huila Departments, who are now in distress. I cannot forget 
that thanks to the solidarity of so many friendly nations, my 
brothers who have lost their dear ones and their belongings due 
to a misfortune, have been able to take the first steps toward a 
new life. Normalcy, no matter how difficult it may seem, and 
although it may take a while to come, is something we must build 
each day. We thank those who have tendered their friendly and 
generous hand to us. 
  Finally, I must recognize the work carried out by the 
government officials of the other member-countries of the 
penta-troika [pentatroika] -- that is, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, 
and Mexico -- who along with Colombia assumed their share of 
responsibility with great enthusiasm and dedication. 
  This summit would not have been possible without them. We 
also want to extend our recognition to several institutions and 
groups of people who, enthused with the significance of the 
summit and possessing a true Ibero-American spirit, contributed 
their valuable cooperation. 
  The millenial Iberia and the young America are united by a 
word, a gesture, and a tone. We understand and express the 
universe in Spanish and Portuguese. This communion of concepts 
grants us an identity. 
  However, more than a past, Ibero-America is the future, the 
hope, and it is a voice that calls for a place in the world. We 
are the crossroads that humankind will pass in the coming 
decades. 
  Colombia, as a member of the Ibero-American fatherland, has 
wanted to be your home in these past days and it bids you 
farewell today, hoping that when you return to your homes, the 
Caribbean sun, Cartagena's hospitality, and, especially, the 
Colombians' unlimited warmth and gratitude are engraved in your 
memories forever. 
  Friends, the project started by Antonelli so many years ago 
was intended to defend Cartagena de Indias. At that time, the 
walls were needed to separate men from other men, people from 
other people, and cities from other cities. Today, these walls, 
stone by stone, should serve to unite Ibero-America, to build 
new bridges that will unite men, to turn our countries into an 
everlasting brotherhood, and make the land of the Portuguese, 
the Spaniard, and the American one where it is possible to make 
our dreams come true. 
  I thus declare this Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State 
and Government closed, not without wishing that any one of our 
six teams at the World Cup Soccer Games be victorious so we can 
accomplish our dreams in this respect. Thank you. [applause]

<F P=106> [Speech by Argentine President Carlos Menem at the closing </F>
session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state 
and government, at the Convention Center in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia, on 15 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] Ladies and gentlemen, brothers and sisters of 
Ibero-America: 
  In a few minutes we will be distributing to the media the 
conclusions of this Fourth Ibero-American Summit. Following the 
guidelines established at the Guadalajara Summit, it is my turn, 
as president of the country that will host the Fifth 
Ibero-American Summit, to speak of these two days of intense 
work that we have conducted. These have been two days mainly 
marked by a clear sense and concept of what democracy and 
freedom are. Absolutely nothing was left to be discussed. All 
the topics suggested for discussion were discussed in depth in 
well-presented statements, and this has left us convinced that 
there is no better way of making progress in development and 
growth than this type of meeting that allows us to present our 
proposals based on the experiences we have lived and are living 
in our countries. Important issues that have been a matter of 
discussion for a long time on other continents have become 
crucial issues of these meetings, especially this fourth summit 
that is about to end. 
  We are conducting a process in the image and likeness of 
what 
is happening in the old Europe. Europe has been discussing this 
issue since the days of the so-called Steel and Coal Community, 
for the past 40 or 50 years. We began this process of 
integration and the establishment of free trade zone only 10 
years ago, only a decade ago. The results to date have been 
highly positive. We have centered our discussions, talks, and 
proposals on the issue of trade. Don Manuel Belgrano, an 
Argentine, one of our forefathers, a lawyer and great statesman 
who later became, because of the circumstances in general of the 
nation, once said that trade was the soul of the peoples. That 
phrase continues to be true today. This is why we have also 
centered our attention on trade as a proposal for development 
and growth of our respective nations. This can be either 
bilateral or multilateral trade. But this is mainly based on 
the proposal for integration, on the proposal for free trade 
zones that little by little are becoming a reality. 
  We have talked about the processes of transformation. We 
have also said that there is no incompatibility between state 
and market, especially the social or popular market economy. We 
have also said that there is no incompatibility between 
democracy and this new proposal in the fields of commerce and 
industry; this is true at least for many Latin American 
countries. However, we have also centered our attention on the 
fact that these processes of in-depth change have, in some 
countries, increased the poverty index. This is one of the main 
concerns we, the men who are leading the destiny of our 
countries, have. 
  But we have also reached the conclusion that there is no 
better system of government than this one, the one we have in 
practically all the Latin American countries; be it democracy 
based on the presidential system, democracy based on a monarchic 
system, or parliamentarian democracy. In the end, these are all 
democracies. A sole and indisputable democracy without any sort 
of gadgetry in which the people can fulfill their aspirations in 
total freedom without obstacles or problems. The people can 
also speak freely and without pressure. This freedom is the 
main guideline on the path toward that future of greatness that 
lies ahead for man if he learns that democracy is essential to 
attain peace and in that world of peace, justice. Peace, 
justice, and freedom are issues that evidently concern mankind. 
It is our duty, the duty of the men chosen by the people, to 
make this a reality. 
  Of course, we also talked about human rights. We have talked 
about the right to life. We have talked about the mother and 
the child. We will continue to talk about this until the next 
summit. 
  If you were to ask me at this moment which of the four 
summits has been the most positive, I would have to say -- and I 
am not trying to say that the others were not -- that this one 
has been the most important because of the issues discussed, 
because of the freedom with which we expressed ourselves, and 
because of the organization. This was an important and 
effective summit. 
  As if this were not enough, during this closing session we 
listened to the words of the Colombian president who closed, 
with a golden broach, this meeting that next year we will repeat 
in Argentina. The actual site for the next summit will be 
chosen in the next few months. Perhaps we can hold the next 
summit in one of the most European cities on this earth, Buenos 
Aires [laughter], or in one of the most beautiful places of this 
continent, in southern Argentina, in Bariloche. Perhaps even on 
the beautiful beaches of Mar del Plata. But we will hold the 
summit in a place where our guests will feel good and 
comfortable and where they can enjoy the freedom and democracy 
we, the Argentines enjoy and try to strengthen. 
  In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, freedom and democracy 
are strengthened with greater freedom and greater democracy. 
Thank you and I will see you in Argentina. [applause]

<F P=106> [From the "Channel 7 News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] On 11 and 12 June, the government reported a violent 
plot to destabilize the country, a plot that could delay the 
peace process, cause terror, and prevent the renewal of the 
Congress. President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said if necessary he 
will deploy Army troops to quell the first protests, which he 
termed manipulated protests. 
  [Begin recording] [De Leon] These are acts of vandalism. I 
have already given instructions to the government minister; we 
even talked about the actions we will take. As of 13 June, we 
will take special security measures. We refuse to tolerate 
vandalism, disorder, and public unrest. I said we will take 
these steps beginning on 13 June because demonstrators will take 
advantage of the beginning of classes to stage these protests. 
We are sure this is not a fortuitous event; on the contrary, it 
is a planned event. Therefore, we will enforce the law, which is 
on our side; we will put order in Guatemala with the law on our 
side. 
  I just gave instructions to the government minister, and he 
explained to me that there are some problems due to the lack of 
police agents. On 13 June, however, we will establish some 
mechanisms to protect businesses, honest citizens, and students 
who want to attend classes and who are not involved in illegal 
acts. Therefore, the people can rest assured we will adopt 
special measures beginning on 13 June. I repeat: The law is on 
our side, and we will make sure public order will not be altered. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Are there groups that are being 
manipulated? 
  [De Leon] Certainly. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [De Leon] I really do not know, but I ordered an 
investigation. It is obvious, isn't it? 
  [Reporter] As a security measure, will the Army [words 
indistinct] these groups? 
  [De Leon] Should it be necessary, we will do it. We will not 
do it for the time being, however. I am currently holding talks 
with the national defense chief of staff on the need to 
reinforce -- as we have been doing lately -- civilian 
authorities. According to the Constitution, the Army's role is 
to maintain public order, security, peace, and sovereignty. 
These are among the Army's main responsibilities. [end

a grave mistake, affecting a country trying to consolidate its 
democracy, Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal said upon arriving in 
Cartagena de Indias to participate in the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit. 
  Although the aid has been objected to by Republican 
congressmen due to unresolved claims for property 
indemnification filed by U.S. citizens, Minister Leal said the 
Helms-Gonzalez Amendment has been misinterpreted. He added that 
when a country has an adequate indemnification system, as in the 
case of Nicaragua, there should be no major problems.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Demetrio Villaurrutia from Colombia] </F>
  [Text] Our commander in chief's first address during the 14 
June morning session of the fourth Ibero-American summit was 
followed by another. This was a closed-door session held at the 
Convention Center. The address came during a debate regarding 
democracy in Latin America, which included a clear reference to 
Cuba. Brazilian President Itamar Franco then stated that the 
only way Latin American peoples can help is by joining efforts 
in supporting Cuba and its reintegration into the OAS. This 
motivated Fidel to speak and I believe it is important for all 
our listeners throughout Cuba to listen to his words. 
  [Begin Castro recording] I want to -- since my country, 
Cuba, 
has been mentioned repeatedly by several of the speakers -- 
first of all give thanks to those who care about Cuba. I can 
feel a sincerity in what they have said. This is why I have 
applauded each one. I know that at times when I speak, some do 
not applaud. That is fine. I respect that. I believe this is a 
democratic thing and each has to do what they believe is 
pertinent. I have applauded everyone, some more enthusiastically 
than others. From everyone I have truly felt -- and I thank you 
for it -- a concern about Cuba. 
  It caught my attention, however -- this is why I appreciate 
so much President Itamar Franco's gesture -- that not a word has 
been said about the unfair, criminal, and inhuman blockade which 
for over 30 years has been imposed against Cuba; the largest 
ever blockade in the history of a Latin American country with 
which no dialogue is sought. What is sought is to smother Cuba 
in blood and make it surrender by hunger. This is the reality. 
  I would have liked to hear, within that Latin American 
spirit, some reference to this. I believe our people also 
deserve commendation if we keep in mind the heroism, firmness, 
and dignity with which they have resisted for over 30 years the 
U.S. blockade and aggression. Later on, we were left alone. 
Many, when left alone, surrender. Yet we have not surrendered. 
We have continued fighting because we are aware that we are 
defending the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the 
peoples of Latin America. This is, precisely, what Marti wanted 
with Cuba's independence. 
  It amazes me that not a word has been said to the effect 
that 
Cuba is the country which has advanced the most socially in the 
history of this hemisphere. We have done so much that I believe 
we have done more than what was possible. Not a single word has 
been said, as we speak about the social crisis in this 
hemisphere and so many closed schools, to the effect that our 
country, subjected to a double blockade, has not closed a single 
hospital, a single school. It has not abandoned anyone. Our 
country, even under the most difficult conditions, has struggled 
and resisted. 
  In a hemisphere, which as you know well, whatever our 
current, present, or definitive -- as you will -- 
accomplishments may be, which please me to no end....[pauses] We 
know, however, that this hemisphere where we all live has the 
worst distribution in the whole wide world by far. I am talking 
about our region, with exceptions, of course, in certain 
countries. This is the region with the worst distribution of 
national income in the world and where so much remains to be 
done. Yet, not a single word is said about it. 
  It also surprises me that not a single word has been said 
about the joint position which we should present at the 
notorious Miami summit. This is very important, vital, and 
looming close. 
  Finally, I would like to state that I respect your views. I 
sincerely respect your thoughts, concepts, and ideas about 
democracy. We should hold a summit to discuss what is democracy 
and what is meant by people's participation; what does it mean 
that millions of people die in this hemisphere every year from 
disease and hunger, millions who could be saved. It is our duty 
to think about all of this if we are democratic, if we are human. 
  We have our ideas and views on democracy and do not feel 
ashamed of them. With these views we have resisted and struggled 
for 35 years. I believe the blows we have endured during these 
35 years -- we cannot forget history -- since we were first 
blockaded, way before the declaration of the socialist character 
of the Revolution, when we were blockaded and our sugar quota 
was apportioned among all ....[pauses] Cuba was left practically 
alone with the highly noble exception of Mexico which maintained 
ties and relations with us. I respect everyone's views. I 
believe that if we are to speak about democracy, we have to 
speak of a multiplicity of views and opinions. I ask that our 
views be respected in the same manner that we respect yours. 
This said, I thank you once more for the concern you have 
expressed regarding Cuba. Thank you very much. [applause] [end 
recording]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (NA) -- Today, state workers in 
Chaco, Salta, and Catamarca Provinces pursued their pressure 
measures to demand payment of their wages and salaries, thus 
expanding the level of conflict in the provinces of northwestern 
Argentina. 
  Arnoldo Anibal Nunez, Catamarca Association of State Workers 
(ATE) secretary general, confirmed today that public servants 
are implementing a "business slowdown" that involves the 
provincial public administration. Nunez reported that the 
provincial government "has still not paid May wages to public 
servants in the provincial capital, or April wages to municipal 
workers in the interior of the province." The ATE secretary 
general also reported that the government has still not paid the 
one-time 130 peso school allowance that is usually paid at the 
beginning of the academic year. 
  Yesterday, Catamarca court employees launched a struggle 
program involving partial strikes, while municipal employees in 
the city of Catamarca will begin a "business slowdown" today. 
  Nunez reported that the state workers will carry out a 
demonstration on 17 June outside the government house. The 
demonstration has been called by the Argentine Workers Congress 
(CTA). 
  The teachers, grouped under the Association of Education 
Workers, which is a CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of 
the Argentine Republic] associate, will hold a 24-hour strike 
tomorrow to demand payment of their June wages. 
  In Salta, public servants will hold a strike and a 
demonstration tomorrow outside the provincial Congress building 
to demand a 500 peso minimum wage. Miguel Quiroga, Salta ATE 
social action secretary, pointed out that the protest "will be 
held to demand the timely payment of salaries, as health workers 
and retirees have still not collected theirs." 
  Quiroga reported that the demonstration will be held to 
protest the decision to transfer the pension fund to the federal 
government, and to demand education and public health budget 
increases. 
  In Chaco, the trade unions of state workers will hold a 
general strike today to reject the provincial government's goal 
of transferring the pension fund to the federal government. The 
pressure measure will be accompanied by a demonstration outside 
the provincial Congress building, where the Chamber of Deputies 
will discuss a bill on the transfer of the Provincial Social 
Security Institute.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with deposed President Jean-Bertrand </F>
Aristide by correspondent Carlos Agudelo in Washington; date not 
given] 
  [Text] Jean-Bertrand Aristide is a small man with a slight 
build, which at first glance veils the intense intuition he 
expresses through his statements. One immediately becomes aware 
of the great humility of this man, a main player in an 
international drama. This humility is mixed with a sense of 
confidence and conviction, a product of years of intense 
internal as well as external struggle. 
  In a low but firm voice, he methodically expresses the hope 
that someday, ideally soon, he will be able to return as 
president of Haiti, and that his return will be accompanied by 
democracy. 
  [EL TIEMPO] As you know, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
was elected OAS secretary general as a result of, among other 
things, Haiti's vote. How do you perceive the OAS' 
participation in the situation in your country? 
  [Aristide] What is taking place in Haiti goes much further 
than national borders and directly touches the soul of the 
continent. The OAS has a critical role to play, and so far, it 
has fortunately played a very positive role. There must be a 
political willingness and a commitment for reestablishing 
democracy, however. This is not easy because the OAS is not an 
institution with the prospects and freedom to force the coupists 
into honoring what they said they were going to do in the 
Governors Island Agreement. 
  Along with this, we are in a race against time because each 
time sanctions are strengthened more strains are placed on the 
Haitian people. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you have an agenda for resolving the 
situation, and what steps do you believe should be taken? 
  [Aristide] The entire world is certainly more powerful than 
the coupists. And yet, there still is no political willingness 
because if an embargo existed, the wait would have been 
shortened. As long as we continue to move along with an embargo 
that is not a complete embargo, suffering is going to continue 
for long time. 
  The presence of ships could be used to transmit messages on 
short and medium-wave radios to communicate with soldiers, poor 
people, students, and liberal Haitian citizens. We should give 
them the necessary information to unite and recover the security 
that prevailed in the country for seven months. During that 
time, refugees did not flee from Haiti; we fought poverty and 
human misery, and we worked with dignity. Democracy is built 
through the people and by respecting human dignity. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you still believe it is necessary to remove 
the Haitian military leaders in an effort to find a solution? 
  [Aristide] That is the only way. The coupists are holding 
the Army and the country captive. In Haiti, there is one 
soldier for every 1,000 Haitians, while there is only one doctor 
for every 10,000 Haitians. Less than 1 percent of the 
population owns more than 45 percent of the nation's wealth. 
This is why we have an illiteracy rate of 85 percent. 
  Because of this situation, the population understands the 
need for an embargo. Even though they have seen that the Army 
is making money from the embargo, they are still demanding the 
implementation of a complete embargo because they know that 
sooner or later the coupists will have to do something about it. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Is it true that the military leaders who are in 
power are drug traffickers? 
  [Aristide] Are you asking me if they are drug traffickers? 
(Aristide laughs) More than $1.2 billion enters Haiti from drug 
trafficking, which represents a danger for Haiti and for the 
United States. If we want to protect the families in both 
countries, we must remove the traffickers who are in power. 
  [EL TIEMPO] What is your opinion regarding the current 
situation in the Dominican Republic, and how could Balaguer's 
possible reelection change this? 
  [Aristide] I believe we must talk to the Dominican Republic 
on how to enforce the sanctions. If the United States 
categorically expresses its political willingness to respect the 
agreements, and if the UN and the OAS do the same, I do not 
believe there will be any problem for that country in applying 
the sanctions. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Do you still consider the Governors Island 
Agreement the basis for a resolution to the crisis? 
  [Aristide] Yes, because it has not yet been complied with. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Would you support military intervention in 
Haiti? 
  [Aristide] This would be problematic because Haiti's 
Constitution prohibits military intervention. The Governors 
Island Agreement, however, contains provisions for the presence 
of international observers to help reconstruct the country, 
separate the police from the Army, and create a fair legal 
system, one without impunity. This would have to be done with 
international cooperation. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some sectors of the U.S. Congress have tried to 
discredit you by claiming that you are mentally unstable. How 
do you view this position by the U.S. right? 
  [Aristide] First, I have a psychology degree and I 
understand 
quite well what tarnishing a person's reputation entails. 
Second, it would only take reading my three books to know my 
beliefs well. Third, a racist policy and a cynical attitude 
prevails in the United States. When Haitians and Cubans are on 
the same boat, as I have seen on television myself, Cubans are 
allowed to continue while Haitians are turned back. This is a 
racist policy. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Considering that you do not have a majority in 
the Haitian parliament, do you believe that conditions exist to 
build a coalition that would enable you to govern if you are 
indeed returned to power? 
  [Aristide] That I do not have a majority in the government 
cannot truly be asserted. Two-thirds of the Senate and more 
than 30 deputies attended a conference we organized in Miami. 
More than 65 percent of Haitians voted for me, and they are 
still committed to such a degree that 31 months after the coup 
d'etat, they are still demonstrating. In this context, I 
believe that currently more than 65 percent of the population 
supports the democratization process. 
  In the parliament, there is a majority that cannot voice 
their opinion because they have rifles pointed at their heads. 
Many members of parliament have gone into hiding in order to 
survive. In this sense, it is the power of the coupists' 
weapons that rules the country. I am convinced that once the 
coupists withdraw, we will free the Army and the country and 
create unity and justice. 
  [EL TIEMPO] Some people view you as part of the problem 
rather than part of the solution. Have you considered the 
possibility of withdrawing from the process to facilitate a 
solution in Haiti? 
  [Aristide] This view is part of that cynical attitude. The 
truth is that after 31 months, currently more than 65 percent of 
the population is still fighting for the return of democracy. 
With this in mind, our fight is irreversible. We believe in 
humanity and surrendering would be a lack of respect for those 
who sacrificed their lives.

<F P=106> [Interview via satellite with President Gonzalo Sanchez de </F>
Lozada in La Paz by reporter Jacobo Zabludovsky in Mexico City; 
from the "24 Hours" newscast -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Zabludovsky] Mr. President, I 
would like to take this opportunity to speak a bit about your 
country and your government. How have you, as a philosopher and 
politician, a man torn between certainty and doubts, dealt with 
your government program? 
  [Sanchez] Well, 10 months have gone by and my first year in 
office is about to end in two more months. This year has been 
very difficult because it has been a year spent sowing and 
paving the way. We have been able to enact significant legal 
measures. These measures, however, are still somewhat abstract 
since the people have not yet been able to see the end results. 
Obviously, we must first pave the way. We have been able to 
carry out capitalization measures, a very innovative course of 
action that entails rescuing failing state enterprises and 
encouraging the private sector and Bolivian people to become 
shareholders in these enterprises. In addition to encouraging 
new investments, we have also been able to implement an 
initiative to acknowledge the contribution of the indigenous 
community after 500 years and to grant them self-government in 
the form of territorial municipalities, urban as well as rural. 
In addition, we have been able to distribute 20 percent of the 
state's revenues among the regions, according to each region's 
population. These are some very innovative measures. We are 
currently struggling to implement in-depth education reforms. 
Just like all other countries, what our country really needs 
are jobs and education. Education represents the passport to the 
future, and jobs are the best way to promote activity, more 
jobs, dignity, and taxes in order to satisfy the people's needs. 
  [Zabludovsky] It would seem to me that it is not an easy 
task 
to govern a country such as yours which is embedded in the 
Andes. At any rate, I am not sure whether the phase -- they may 
take away the adventure, but not attempts from the heart -- 
means anything to you. 
  [Sanchez] Yes. Once my grandfather asked a Bolivian 
president what it is like to be president of Bolivia. At the 
time my grandfather was foreign minister. The president 
answered that everything is fine when there is money, but that 
he would not recommend the job when there is no money. 
Unfortunately, I have had the misfortune to become president at 
a time when there is no money. Nevertheless, there is a lot of 
goodwill and consensus. Bolivia is a country that has undergone 
tremendous shocks. The prices of the raw materials we 
traditionally export such as tin, gas, and hydrocarbons have 
dropped to practically nothing. The country has also been able 
to control its tremendous 25,000 percent hyperinflation. 
Currently we have single digit inflation. There is a lot of 
confidence that we will be able to forge ahead. Nevertheless, it 
is very difficult because everyone is calling for adjustments, 
yet no one wants them once they are implemented. I am quite 
sure that deep down, Bolivia knows it must change and improve. 
I am convinced that my second year in office will be a year of 
performance, and we anticipate results during the third year. 
These results might be good, average, or bad, but I am very sure 
that the Bolivian people's sacrifice will be well rewarded. 
  [Zabludovsky] How has drug trafficking influenced or 
interfered in Bolivia's political life? 
  [Sanchez] Drug trafficking is one of the most pressing 
problems confronting Bolivia. No one can explain why we do not 
have narcoguerrillas or cartels similar to the ones in Cali, for 
example. It is possible it is because social cohesion is very 
strong in Bolivia. Family and community ties are very strong; 
at any rate, the issue is one of concern because we are a very 
fragile nation. Our institutions are very vulnerable, and we are 
apprehensive about this drug-trafficking issue. 
  We are struggling hard against drug trafficking and seeking 
strategies to convince the peasantry to become involved in other 
activities. It is not an easy task because there is poverty, 
and one of the few things that produces revenue is the coca 
plant, especially when it is refined into drugs. Despite all 
this, we believe that if we can create enthusiasm for 
industrialization or an alternate economic activity, we will be 
able to find ways for the Bolivian people to abandon this 
activity. It is not an activity we are interested in promoting, 
given that it is so dangerous. 
  Undoubtedly, this is one of the greatest challenges 
confronting us, and we are all searching for solutions, not only 
the government but society as whole because it is undermining 
our youth. We are concerned that tomorrow it might undermine 
our stability as well as our social harmony. 
  [Zabludovsky] The living conditions of the 10,000 or more 
Guarani Indians have been highly criticized. It is said they 
live in extreme poverty, something that is not true only in 
Bolivia. What could be done to combat this issue? 
  [Sanchez] We have made profound reforms. We have changed the 
entire executive branch. We have created ministries, one for 
human resources, which has a secretariat for ethnics, races, and 
generations. We have, for the first time in Latin American 
history, recognized the Indian community by allowing them to 
participate. Two-thirds of Bolivia's population has Indian 
roots and one-third has Western roots; thus, there are very 
powerful dynamics at play here. 
  Actions are stronger than words. The Bolivian vice president 
is the first Indian to occupy this post. He was born near the 
shores of Lake Titicaca. He is a very educated man, a 
professional linguist. This shows that this administration and 
our society are accepting an important fact: Unity is built on 
diversity and it is possible for all these currents to be 
present and yet have a stronger country and a more balanced 
society. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Santiago, 15 Jun (EFE) -- Sources at the Chilean 
presidential palace of La Moneda have reported that the group of 
Cubans who today entered the Chilean Consulate General in Havana 
consists of seven young men, one woman, and a child. 
  According to the same sources, who did not provide any 
further details, a full report on this event will be released 
within the next few hours. 
  The Chilean Foreign Ministry had already confirmed the entry 
of the group of Cubans into the Chilean Consulate, and added 
that President Eduardo Frei and Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa 
have already been informed about the event. 
  Frei and his foreign minister are participating in the 
Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. 
  This is the third time Cubans have rushed into an embassy in 
Havana over the past 20 days. They had done so before at the 
Belgian and German embassies.

<F P=106> [Statement by Andres Pastrana, presidential candidate of </F>
Colombia's Conservative Party; date and place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] Friends: Our country is full of experts, public 
officials, politicians, and economists. They all believe they 
have the solution to each and every one of Colombia's problems. 
The truth is, however, they may all know many things, but most 
of them do not really know how the people live, how you live. 
They have never seen the places you call home. They do not 
know the effort it takes to pay bills or to stretch your budget 
to try to make ends meet. They do not have to worry, as you do, 
about how to educate your children and provide the opportunities 
for new jobs in a new economy. The experts, the economists, and 
ranking officials do not have in their homes the staples that 
you can barely afford on your salary. They have not seen you 
sweating as you work. They do not live the life of anguish you 
live. 
  The time has come to have a government and president who 
will 
be in contact with you and your problems, who will understand 
that behind every abstract and cold word, words that fill the 
socioeconomic policy documents, there are men and women of flesh 
and blood who have a heart and soul and real frustrations and 
illusions. Due to old political machines, they have been 
disillusioned because thousands of promises have not been kept 
one election after another, because many things were said but 
not done. 
  The time has come to have a president who believes and 
governs, inspired by the will to change, with the conviction 
that what is good for the people is good for Colombia. As you 
know, I do not come from a family that has lacked opportunities. 
Some time ago, before,and during this campaign, I worked to 
understand the problems Colombians face, not only as they appear 
in the documents which my advisers have prepared or in the 
lectures by experts, but through face-to-face contact with each 
and every one of you, learning firsthand of your anguishes and 
difficulties. 
  You and I have shared moments in your neighborhoods and 
communities, throughout the length and breadth of the country. 
For me, the most important thing of this campaign is not the 
thousands of people who have thronged enthusiastically to attend 
the rallies or pack the plazas in small cities and towns. The 
most valuable thing about this effort has been the opportunity 
to talk to thousands of Colombians, person by person, in the 
country, on our coasts, and in the poorest neighborhoods of our 
cities. All of them have had something to say and something to 
contribute. 
  You and I can learn many important things from statistics, 
but statistics do not breathe. Statistics do not cry, in fact, 
they do not care if Colombia achieves a change. If a change is 
not achieved, different figures will follow. With your common 
sense, you are the experts from whom I have learned the most. 
The people, with their votes, are the ones who have always 
given me the posts I have held. I have never been appointed to 
a public post because I have never been part of the machinery; 
that is what has inspired me to have faith in this campaign. If 
you give me the opportunity, I will govern from the Presidency 
with a profound commitment in my heart and conscience, with the 
determination to return to my fatherland at least a little of 
what it has given me. 
  I have heard thousands of questions from the people, and 
they all reflect what is most important for each one of them. I 
am seeking the Presidency to truly serve the people. I have not 
improvised in accordance with changes reflected in the polls, 
but I have presented a comprehensive program of changes that I 
have discussed with you on television, radio, in our multiple 
face-ta- face meetings with the people. I am certain that you 
have not found contradictions or opportunism in this program. 
  Our program offers new jobs, not as a simple slogan repeated 
to obtain votes, but these are actual, productive, well-paying 
jobs based on the creation of new companies and the attraction 
of new investments to the cities and countryside as well as the 
development of the capability and qualifications of all 
Colombians. 
  We have provided for training and the qualification of more 
than 2 million workers by strengthening the National 
Apprenticeship Services, initiating a revolution in education 
that will allow each child between the ages of five and 15 years 
to go to school, and by upgrading training centers that will 
open the doors to job opportunities for 99 percent of Colombian 
youths who have not had access to universities. For this, I 
will personally make it my responsibility that those who have 
the honorable task of being teachers of the new generations will 
once again be awarded the place of esteem they deserve with good 
working conditions, facilities to develop their tasks, and a 
fitting salary that recognizes the importance of their work for 
our present and our future. Only by doing this will our people 
be prepared to receive betterment and our nation able to offer 
good jobs with good 21st century salaries. 
  Definitely, the way to confront, without deceit, the cost of 
living is to give Colombians the possibility of learning more to 
achieve a better standard of living. In developing our 
government program, we will construct 660,000 new housing units 
for compatriots who need them, and we will take potable water to 
more than 10 million Colombians. More than being good for the 
economy, it is the government's moral obligation to make all 
Colombians participants of prosperity. 
  As president, I will not privatize any of the government's 
basic services. The political establishment is trying to scare 
our people by lying in this regard. They do not want it to be 
known that the people who work for the government are good and 
qualified. Those who are not good or qualified are certain 
politicians who regard the government as booty. To this I say 
the response is not to attack the workers; the response is to 
defeat the old political establishment. 
  Our program also provides for strong action to combat 
insecurity in the cities and countryside. In the struggle 
against guerrilla violence, what is needed is a dynamic strategy 
that will prevent any delay in the dream for peace. I have 
already said the government does not choose between war and 
peace. 
  The government must protect the lives, honor, assets, and 
human rights of all Colombians. Make no mistake: We will not 
compromise in this task. If the guerrillas are truly determined 
to achieve peace, I will personally sit down to negotiate with 
them on concrete bases to achieve concrete results. In my 
government, I will not permit a dialogue by deaf people, a 
dialogue that would lead to nowhere while extortions, 
kidnappings, murders, and the blowing up of pipelines continue. 
  I have been proposing for quite a while a strategy aimed at 
eliminating obligatory military service and replacing it with a 
professional army, an army well paid and well equipped in order 
to defend us all. I have been proposing this for some time, 
through conviction and not because a poll has indicated this is 
a popular position; this is why I did not have to change my 
opinion during the campaign. 
  Nevertheless, this will not be the only type of insecurity 
we 
will fight. We will continue our intense struggle against drug 
trafficking and narcoterrorism and we will combat with full 
force the crime that has taken over our cities. In conjunction 
with the military forces we will strengthen the police, 
intelligence, and investigative institutions, and we will create 
expert armed corps to deal with muggers, apartment burglars, car 
thieves, and all other urban mafias. 
  There is another issue that has been floating about during 
this campaign, an issue poised as a dark shadow over our 
democracy, an issue that has influenced our people not to vote, 
despite the longing for change. How can you know if the 
promises a candidate has made will be kept once he reaches 
power? In my opinion, there is only one valid answer: Colombia 
does not need any more candidates who chase the people's votes. 
We need a president who will again listen to the voices of 
Colombians. 
  For a long time, for many generations, politicians have 
appealed to you. They have made you promises, and you in turn 
have responded with your support, but once they reach the 
Presidency, you never see them again, except when the 
presidential motorcade passes by with its guards and sirens. 
They do not think about you again because your problems quickly 
fade from the mind of the presidential politician. I am bent on 
changing this. The change I intend to implement and which I 
will explain to you now will be fundamental so that all the 
other changes we want will come about. 
  The president will take office on 7 August. On that day, I 
will not limit myself to entering Narino Palace and not coming 
out again. On 7 September, I will take all my ministers to a 
small town for a face-to-face meeting with the people. The 
people will be able to ask questions at this time and tell us 
how they think we started our administration, where we are 
making mistakes, or where we have not done enough. They can 
also suggest to us another way of doing things. On the seventh 
day of every month during my Presidency, I will hold a meeting, 
face to face, in a poor neighborhood, or in the countryside, a 
school, or a university, in different parts of the country. On 
the seventh day of each month during my Presidency, I will 
consult with the real experts, the real polls, the real advisers 
-- the Colombian people. 
  As president, I will go back to the people the seventh day 
of every month for a face-to-face meeting. I am not asking you 
to vote only for a change. I am asking you to form part of this 
change. You already embarked on this change on 29 May, but your 
responsibility does not end on 19 June. We will meet again as 
we have done throughout this campaign on the seventh day of each 
month. Power will be in your hands, in the hands of the people. 
The president will be there to hear you, and I will take your 
concerns back with me to the Presidency of the Republic. 
  Your vote plus one will equal victory on 19 June, not the 
victory of a candidate, but a victory of a cause, for a 
government that is genuinely of the people and not only dubbed 
with that name, a victory for a government that is not isolated 
at the presidential palace but, rather, a victory for a 
government in permanent contact with the people, a victory for a 
leadership that responds with actions to the millions of 
Colombians who have fallen behind or have been left off the road 
to progress. 
  Those of the establishment, their bureaucratic quotas, and 
their politicians are working overtime and at full speed to hold 
back the change, but your vote plus one on 19 June will be more 
powerful than that old political establishment. Your vote plus 
one will be the most powerful voice of Colombia on that day. Do 
not allow that old establishment to score a win. Give me your 
support, and your voice will be heard on election day and during 
the next four years. 
  Give me your support, and together we will change Colombia 
on 
19 June and every day of my Presidency. Together, let us take a 
risk to change and struggle and make Colombia the nation of 
which we all dream. I ask today that you and I, together, be 
the ones to change Colombia.

  [Text] Yesterday, President Luis Alberto Lacalle asked the 
publishers in our country to bear in mind that the idea of 
liberty is also "imbued with a lofty idea of responsibility." 
  Upon signing the Chapultepec Declaration on freedom of the 
press, Lacalle discussed this issue with the top officials of 
the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA) yesterday. The 
president pointed out: "Even though there is a constitutional 
provision establishing liberty and all of us are ready to 
preserve it, liberty is increasingly matched by the 
responsibility of publishers, editors, directors, and owners." 
  The chief executive noted: "If we bear in mind that the 
judicial branch may not always act quickly, it is necessary for 
liberty to be increasingly matched by the responsibility of 
owners, directors, and media promoters." 
  Lacalle pointed out: "By signing this declaration we confirm 
our commitment to making men entirely free and responsible for 
their actions." 
  Present at the ceremony were IAPA President Raul 
Kraiselburd, 
IAPA Vice President Robert C. Hardie, and local media 
executives, including EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO director Ricardo 
Peirano. Argentine President Carlos Menem signed the 
declaration on 6 June, and Paraguayan President Juan Carlos 
Wasmosy will sign it on 8 June.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- The PT [Workers Party] will not make 
any political agreement with Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) 
[Brazilian Democratic Movement Party - Amapa]. This was reported 
early yesterday evening by PT President Rui Falcao (state deputy 
for SP) [Sao Paulo]. A day earlier, PT presidential candidate 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said that he would accept Sarney's 
support. Lula said that the PT could not refuse to talk with the 
former president and that he will resume the north-south railway 
construction begun by Sarney. 
  "There will be no agreement with Senator Sarney. The PT has 
not and will not seek him. We cannot forbid, however, anyone 
from demonstrating admiration for our candidate," Falcao said 
after the weekly meeting of the PT national executive board. 
  Falcao, one of the leaders of the most radical PT wing, said 
the party cannot make an agreement with Sarney because his 
government was marked by recession and by the liberal 
distribution of radio and television stations [in exchange for 
political support]. Falcao believes that a political alliance 
between Lula and Sarney is "unthinkable." 
  "The PT demonstrated what it thinks of Sarney when it 
struggled with all its might to prevent him from remaining in 
power for five years. No PT deputy voted for the extension of 
his term in office," the PT president said. 
  The party is not disdaining Lula's idea of wanting Sarney's 
support, Falcao said, adding that Lula and the PT agree on one 
point: The objective is to win the votes of Sarney's followers. 
  Despite the meeting held on 8 June between Deputies Aloizio 
Mercadante (PT-SP) and Jose Sarney Filho (PFL-MA) [Liberal Front 
Party - Maranhao] to discuss an alliance between Lula and 
Sarney, Falcao said there has never been an understanding on the 
subject. He said the "informal talks" between Aloizio and Sarney 
Filho were misinterpreted. According to Falcao, the PT's 
strategy will be to maintain direct contacts with Sarney's 
followers and convince them that Lula's government platform is 
the best to get the country through the crisis.

  [Text] The intervention by the government in eight banks, 
which was expected, is now a reality. Many people, however, were 
taken by surprise. The announcement was made by the high council 
of the General Bank Superintendency, which disclosed that since 
25 January the eight banks in question had been receiving funds 
from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund]. The 
banks in question are Banco Maracaibo, Banco La Guaira, Banco 
Metropolitano, Banco Construction, Banco Barinas, Banco 
Amazonas, and Sociedad Financiera Fideca. 
  Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez, a member of the 
General Bank Superintendency's high council, after reading the 
official communique, told reporters that the guaranteed 400 
million bolivares [as heard] per depositor, which totals over 
350 billion bolivares, will be paid with approved bonds worth 
400 billion bolivares. The fact of the case is that, according 
to Sosa Rodriguez, the decision marks a new phase within the 
process of stabilizing and strengthening the national financial 
system. Sosa said that reports by the General Bank 
Superintendency and Fogade prove that assets and operations at 
the eight banks have deteriorated. 
  [Begin Sosa Rodriguez recording] The measure is the result 
of 
a General Bank Superintendency decision and the reports issued 
by Fogade and the Central Bank. The basic reason--which is easy 
to understand--is that Fogade provided quite ample funding to 
those banks and the time came when these institutions could not 
back up Fogade's funds with assets. Consequently, Fogade could 
no longer continue funding them. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, the announcement of the interventions was not 
well 
received by the business sector, which believes they will foster 
distrust and concern regarding the economy, especially since the 
authorities have not disclosed the steps followed in an 
intervention. This was confirmed by Jorge Serrano, first vice 
president of Fedecamaras [Venezuelan Federation of Associations 
and Chambers of Commerce and Industry]. 
  [Begin Serrano recording] Many businessmen have checking 
accounts at those banks and will find their operations 
restricted. Fedecamaras has been receiving calls since 
midmorning from businessmen asking what to do. The government 
should disclose this information to the country as soon as 
possible; if possible within a few hours. [end recording] 
  To conclude, the intervention will not affect the extensions 
granted by the General Bank Superintendency to the eight banks 
in question to restore the capital lost by former shareholders. 
The extension will expire on 29 June and the Superintendency 
will decide how long the eight banks will remain closed.

  [Text] An incident between a Venezuelan Army unit and Zulia 
University students has intensified the wave of violence 
reported over the past few days in the capital of Zulia. As we 
were the first to disclose, an Army jeep escorted by a National 
Guard jeep knocked down two University of Zulia students and two 
high school students who were immediately taken to the Maracaibo 
University Hospital. 
  The incident took place when the jeep was transiting 
University Avenue and the students attempted to stop it and set 
it on fire. The Army troops increased their speed and the 
incident ensued, resulting in four students being injured. The 
two university students most seriously hurt received traumatic 
injuries and were transferred urgently from the University 
Hospital to El Varillal clinic in Zulia, where they are 
undergoing emergency surgery. 
  Due to this circumstance, the rectorial council of the 
University of Zulia decided to suspend classes indefinitely and 
the Secretariat of Education in Zulia ordered the suspension of 
classes at the largest high schools in the Zulian capital. Angel 
Lombardi, rector of the University of Zulia, commented on the 
situation. 
  [Begin Lombardi recording] After consulting with the deans, 
various authorities, and the student leadership, we decided that 
it would be wise to suspend all academic activities today and 
tomorrow. During these two days the University Council will 
assess the situation. We believe our decision might help to 
reduce the violence of the past few days, but I agree with the 
assertions that I have heard. I believe that on Friday there was 
reason for indignation--Friday was a day of indignation and 
anger--over a death which was truly unnecessary and very 
regrettable. [end recording] 
  Classes have been suspended because the disturbances over 
the 
past few days ended in the burning of 15 vehicles and losses 
estimated at 200 million bolivares. On Tuesday, the largest 
demonstrations were staged in Cabimas, where a vehicle was 
burned. In Maracaibo, high school students staged riots despite 
the suspension of classes. They burned tires and closed streets, 
but no major incidents were reported.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
June. 
  The government has announced that the Aeropostal airline 
will 
be put on public bid once again within 90 days. If during this 
time it is not privatized, the company will be closed down, 
because currently it is producing a loss of about 20 million 
bolivars daily. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 
7 Jun 94) 
  Gustavo Roosen, presidential commissioner for financial 
reform, has reported that of the 750 billion bolivars granted as 
financial aid by FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund], only 30 percent will be recovered, because it 
would be unwise to sell the assets of the banks FOGADE is 
supporting. If the assets were to be sold, the market would be 
flooded with property, thereby hurting the construction sector. 
(Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 9 Jun 94) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum Inc. (PDVSA) has reported that the 
production of crude is growing at an annual rate of about 7 
percent in 1994. PDVSA also indicated that between 1992 and 1994 
annual investments of $3.5 billion have been made in this sector 
and that 1993 closed without a deficit. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 9 Jun 94 p E-3) 
  Acting Finance Minister Luis Xavier Grisanti has reported 
that fiscal revenues for the 1994 budget have been reestimated 
at 1.55 trillion bolivars, representing a 322 billion increase 
from last year. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p E-3) 
  The Finance Ministry has reported that 17.6 billion bolivars 
were collected as part of the new Bank Debit Tax debits in the 
first month of its application. The ministry also reported that 
the financial crisis unleashed by the Banco Latino intervention 
has caused uncertainly among the public, which has been 
reflected in the exchange rate and caused a demand for dollars 
that exceeds the needs of the nation's normal economic 
transactions. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p 8) 
  Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce 
and Services, has said merchants remain very concerned about the 
devaluation of the bolivar and increasing interest rates. Both 
factors are prompting higher prices, inflation, a decline in 
sales, and a loss of purchasing power, thereby forcing many 
merchants to close their shops. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 
10 Jun 94 p 10) 
  According to estimates diclosed Saturday, the recovery of 
petroleum prices in recent weeks will provide for additional 
revenues of $242 million for Venezuela. In addition, revenues in 
May increased by approximately $120 million. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 1636 GMT 11 Jun 94) 
  According to Inter-American Development Bank sources, 
Venezuela has been granted 50 loans for a total of $3.501 
billion, registering disbursements of $1.694 billion to be paid 
out in 10 years. Part of this loan will used to construct a 
power station with an installed capacity of 2.160 megawatts, and 
in which environmental aspects have been taken into account. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 2) 
  An official report today indicated that between 2,500 and 
3,000 small and medium-sized industries that have debts of more 
than $1 billion risk going bankrupt. The debts of the industries 
that provide jobs for approximately 100,000 people is unpayable 
by the debtors under the current conditions, according to a 
Development Ministry document. The report indicates that massive 
bankruptcies could be unleashed, which in turn would increase 
the current registered unemployment rate of 22 percent. (Mexico 
City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0121 GMT 14 Jun 94)

<F P=106> [By special correspondents Nestor D. Escobar Franco and </F>
Eduardo Franco] 
  [Text] During his address on 14 June to the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy demanded a 
more tolerant attitude toward Paraguay's position regarding its 
outlet to the sea. He appealed to Argentina and Uruguay for a 
smoother policy for Paraguayan access to the sea. He questioned 
the freight surcharges that make national products more 
expensive, and asked the Ibero-American community for forthright 
solidarity in facing unemployment and deprivation. He also 
called for "a more socially just, more economically free, and 
more politically democratic Ibero-America." Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera asked his colleagues to formulate more 
than a rhetorical condemnation of corruption and asked for 
exemplary punishment of those corrupt people who stuff their 
pockets with public money. 
  Wasmosy maintained that it is of vital importance that 
Paraguay's products have an easy outlet to the sea. He pointed 
out that despite Paraguay's efforts to reach the sea "we run 
into difficulties in Argentina and Uruguay." In this respect he 
noted that such difficulties concern freight surcharges that 
make national products more expensive. 
  Wasmosy insisted that the efforts being made by his 
government to improve the economic and social situation are 
being hampered by Paraguay's landlocked situation. "When using 
our outlets to the sea, whether by river or by land, we run into 
such difficulties as freight surcharges that make our products 
more expensive, and the same happens with the products that we 
import," he said. 
  He added: "In this respect we appeal to the solidarity of 
the countries through which we must transit, and ask them to 
offer an easier policy. Often the maritime countries do not 
understand what it is to be a landlocked country, and what this 
implies." 
  In another passage of his address, Wasmosy called for 
gradual 
integration "to unite a socially more just Ibero-America. [no 
closing quotation marks as published] He said that "under the 
banner of democracy the postponed needs of the people become 
very genuine demands that our mandates cannot ignore." 
  He highlighted the fact that most of the American countries 
have democratic systems that must be strengthened. "We must 
debate the social problems during this summit, as it is a topic 
that concerns all of us who are participating in this forum, and 
we want to seek solutions so that our people can enjoy better 
welfare and better living conditions." 
  Wasmosy stated that there are many needs that must be 
satisfied, such as health conditions, education, employment, 
housing, equal opportunities, and the pressing need for social 
justice. 
  He indicated that in these new times significant problems 
have also emerged due to the increase in crime and drug 
trafficking, which result from economic and social difficulties 
and from the existing imbalances within societies. "In order to 
resolve these social and economic problems, within the framework 
of democracy, we must seek improved distribution of wealth while 
increasing resources on the basis of greater production and 
better quality for all agricultural and industrial products." 
  The president asked "that a frontal attack be made on 
deprivation and misery with an accelerated increase in economic 
and social development, within the framework of inter-American 
solidarity, in order to overcome the deficiencies that show up 
on our social gauges." 
  Wasmosy also indicated that through a social market economy, 
but always respecting individual freedom and through common 
efforts, an improvement in the conditions of life can be 
achieved. "In order to achieve this we must achieve a constant 
and firm economic integration, a goal that will be achieved 
gradually in several stages, including free trade zones." 
  He maintained that the reform of the state demands much more 
economic support. "We need greater financial resources, the 
incorporation of new technologies and, I would even dare to say, 
greater international solidarity," he stressed. 
  He emphasized that he will continue with the reform of the 
state. Wasmosy indicated that in seeking to change the structure 
of the state he has sent several bills to Congress with the 
objective of modifying the financial system, the business 
system, and others.

  [Text] Cartagena -- Salvadoran President Armando Calderon 
Sol on 14 June in Cartagena urged his colleagues meeting in the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State and Government to 
form a common front to defend the legitimate right to 
development of the region's peoples. 
  He said that strengthening representative democracy, 
promoting human rights, and achieving economic and social 
development should be the great goals of the 21 Ibero-American 
leaders. 
  President Calderon, who is attending for the first time the 
meeting of Ibero-American leaders, a group that has already met 
on three occasions, added that now that nearly all peoples of 
the region are enjoying democracy, it is crucial that we direct 
our efforts toward improving the living conditions of our 
people. He called for an expanded discussion among the 
presidents on the integration issue, not just on trade 
liberalization. Calderon pointed out that our Central American 
countries are making enormous efforts toward integration.

  [Excerpts] Chilean President Eduadro Frei has requested 
that Chile be the site of the next Ibero-American summit to be 
held in 1996. [sentence as heard] 
  Speaking before the heads of state attending the summit in 
Cartagena, Frei urged his colleagues to achieve economic 
development on the basis of social development and to combat 
poverty. The following is a report by our special correspondent. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] All the heads of 
state attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit are lodged at 
the Cartagena Hilton Hotel. Four thousand policemen and 
soldiers have been entrusted with the security of the visiting 
dignitaries. For this purpose, they have been detached 
throughout the hotel building and the city where many of them 
have to endure intense heat and humidity. 
  Because of extreme weather conditions, the visiting heads of 
state arrived at the convention center wearing informal clothes. 
President Eduardo Frei was accompanied by his wife, Marta 
Larraechea. 
  Sitting next to Cuban President Fidel Castro during the 
first 
work session, President Frei broached the subject of open 
regionalism. 
  [Frei] We must expand our trade on realistic and specific 
terms and without exceptions. In economy, like in politics, 
exclusion is not only unjust but also dangerous. 
  The number one priority issue of my administration is to 
combat poverty. No matter how important it may be, however, 
government action is not enough to combat this scourge which is 
affecting over one million Chileans. All national groups must, 
therefore, join efforts to overcome this situation. In view of 
this, it is imperative today to establish a culture of 
solidarity which makes people and development the main target of 
both government action and private business. 
  [Reporter] The Ibero-American Summit is the only regional 
group that allows Fidel Castro's attendance. Cuba has been 
excluded from the OAS since 1962 and only countries with 
democratic regimes take part in the Rio Group. [passage omitted] 
  Although this issue is not on the summit's agenda, there are 
informal talks about Cuba's eventual return to the OAS. Asked 
his opinion about this, President Frei said: 
  [Frei] This decision is now up to Cuba. We want Cuba's 
return to the Latin American system. This obviously will be 
achieved by taking steps toward democracy, implementing a 
democratic process, and upholding human rights, which we believe 
is of utmost importance. [passage omitted] [end recording]

  [Text] There has been a change in the agenda of the 
presidents and heads of government. A lunch had been scheduled 
at the Fishing Club around noon today. However, in the wake of 
numerous statements on individual positions each president has 
regarding the Cuban issue, the U.S. economic blockade, and 
President Fidel Castro's unexpected speech yesterday, the 
leaders decided to meet or have lunch here at the convention 
center to discuss, behind closed doors, the positions presented 
on the Cuban case. 
  Later on, at approximately 2100 GMT, the last working 
session 
will be held. Tonight, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
Trujillo and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem will close 
the event. They will be the only speakers at the ceremony.

<F P=106> [Interview with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem by </F>
reporter Manuel de la Rosa and Caracol News Director Dario 
Arizmendi at the Cartagena de Indias Convention Center -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [De La Rosa] Good morning. We are here with 
Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who is playing a tennis 
match teamed up with Dr. Miguel Silva against Ambassador Alberto 
Casas and Counselor Ricardo Avila. Are you winning, Mr. 
President? 
  [Menem] We were at deuce, so we will have to continue to 
play. 
  [De La Rosa] Mr. President, regarding the surprise speech by 
Cuban President Fidel Castro at the convention center yesterday 
afternoon, as well as the subsequent remark he made as he was 
riding in a car -- something to the effect of: We are divided -- 
what is your opinion on this? 
  [Menem] I would say there are different concepts of 
democracy. One is the one understood by free countries in which 
the people elect their representatives. There are no barriers, 
no penalties, and no prohibitions on leaving one's territory or 
on stating one's opinion -- places in which there are no 
political prisons, persecution, or torture. 
  The other form of democracy is that which Commander Fidel 
Castro understands. He gets angry, speaks out melodramatically 
regarding the situation in Cuba, and I say this with all respect 
due to the commander. Only one thing is to blame for the crisis 
Cuba is facing, and it is this: As long as Cuba does not live 
in democracy, and as long as it does not return to a way of life 
common to other countries in America and in the world, it will 
be very difficult for our positions to agree. 
  I have been a victim of the tyranny of a dictatorship. I was 
virtually an outlaw in my own country for 25 years. I spent 
five years in prison. I know what it is like to be tortured, 
what the punishment cells entail. I know that my companions 
suffered greatly during the years when the killings occurred. 
Nobody can tell me or teach me anything about that, not even 
the commander, who was never in prison. 
  Moreover, there is no indication that the situation in Cuba 
will change. This is something that is entirely up to him. 
This is why I do not see any sense in the melodrama he is 
making of the Cuban situation, blaming it on the U.S. blockade 
imposed solely, I would say, by the United States. Other 
countries are trading and, in fact, bringing capital into Cuba. 
The measures and controls are so strict, however, that they 
discourage any type of investment. This is the truth. 
  [De La Rosa] President Menem, this melodrama that you speak 
of by Fidel Castro, couldn't it complicate things for Latin 
American integration? 
  [Menem] No, no, no. I am familiar with integration processes 
in other parts of the world in which countries that disagree 
with circumstances that prevail in a region or on a continent 
cannot integrate with the other nations of the region. They do 
not enter into the free zone until their plans and proposals 
change. If we live in a democracy, one has to follow the steps 
of the majority -- not only the majority at the state level, but 
also the majority at the level of the people. 
  [De La Rosa] Commander Castro noted that he was hurt 
yesterday afternoon by a lack of solidarity from the Latin 
American countries against the U.S.-imposed blockade against the 
island. 
  [Menem] I do not believe it is a lack of solidarity. I 
reiterate that many countries of the world are commercializing 
and taking their production to Cuba, as well as working with 
Cuba over these past few years. For instance, in 1974 the 
Argentine Republic under the presidency of General Peron broke 
the U.S. blockade and assisted Cuba with resources, products, 
and foodstuffs to the point that ever since then, and subsequent 
to the many contributions that were made, Cuba owes Argentina 
more than $1 billion. The commander, should then speak of this 
reality, which we Argentines know of very well. 
  [De La Rosa] Are the Ibero-American countries divided then, 
as the Cuban president stated informally? 
  [Menem] I do not think they are divided, just the opposite. 
We are all asking Commander Castro to give respite to the Cuban 
people -- to leave them in a position to exercise their rights. 
We are speaking of the defense of human rights. We are 
speaking of life. We are speaking of liberty. Obviously these 
things are nonexistent in Cuba. 
  [De La Rosa] President Menem, thank you for suspending your 
tennis match to give an interview to Caracol Network. Dario, do 
you have any questions? 
  [Arizmendi] Yes, of course. We are pleased to greet 
President Carlos Saul Menem again, after interviewing him 
exactly one year ago for Colombian television. Mr. President, 
if the Cuban president does not change his position regarding 
the concept of democracy, as it is understood in Western terms, 
is there a possibility that he will not be invited to future 
summits? 
  [Menem] No, no. The commander is always going to be invited. 
Now, Dario, I do not understand the distinction that you just 
made -- Western style democracy. I believe there is only one 
democracy. Everyone participates in that democracy. Democracy 
is created when people elect their representatives and when the 
representatives govern for the people. There is only one kind 
of democracy, and not the kind maintained by Fidel Castro. It 
so happens that not too many years ago Chilean President 
Pinochet said his dictatorship was a democratic one. In other 
words, there are different concepts of democracy, but there is 
only one kind of democracy. 
  [Arizmendi] President Menem, you have been, perhaps, one of 
the most principled presidents, and your attitude regarding all 
types of dictatorship has been well-known to the public for some 
time. When you meet Cuban President Fidel Castro, how do you 
greet one another? Is there any kind of warmth or cordiality, or 
is there distance between you? 
  [Menem] No, there is cordiality, and there is fluid 
dialogue, 
but we do not speak of politics or anything related. We were 
talking yesterday about the place where I was born, what we do 
there, what my family's activities are, whether my family has 
vineyards, and if my family makes wine. I explained several 
things to him regarding my hometown in a province in the 
northwestern region of the Argentine Republic. We did not 
broach politics at all. Those things have to be discussed 
publicly. They have to be treated as we have been treating them 
since the Guadalajara summit. The commander also, publicly, has 
referred to his form and style of government, and his references 
are common to those of any dictatorship, or at least any kind of 
government outside democracy. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jun (EFE) -- Argentine President 
Carlos Menem today criticized his Brazilian counterpart Itamar 
Franco because, during the inauguration of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Colombia, Franco praised the policies 
of Fidel Castro administration's in Cuba. 
  "Franco gave Castro a toehold from which to throw everything 
he had to defend Cuba and to assure that his government is 
totally democratic," the Argentine president complained to a 
Buenos Aires radio station. 
  Menem said: "Five or six heads of state had just asked 
Castro 
to democratize Cuba. Castro defended his regime and launched a 
frontal attack against the United States and the cruelty of 
their policy of blockading the island." 
  He added: "It would have all ended there if, at the end of 
the round of speeches, Franco had not unexpectedly asked to 
speak again. He took the floor to praise Fidel Castro and Cuban 
policies, and to ask for the lifting of the blockade." 
  The Argentine Government is Castro's staunchest opponent in 
Latin America, which is consistent with Menem's foreign policy 
of full alignment with U.S. positions. 
  Menem said he held a long conversation with Castro during a 
boat trip by the heads of state in Cartagena yesterday. He made 
clear, however, that the talk was not official and that the two 
leaders did not discuss political matters. 
  The president said: "We did not talk about politics, we 
talked about Anillaco," the town in the northeast where Menem 
was born.

  [Text] Cartagena, Colombia, 15 Jun (NA) -- Argentine 
Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella censured Fidel Castro in 
Cartagena today over the latter's speech during the inauguration 
of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and 
governments. He said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape 
because its policies are very bad." 
  Di Tella confirmed the possibility of a personal meeting 
between President Carlos Menem and Castro. He added, however, 
that "conditions are not right" following the harsh speech by 
Castro yesterday. 
  Di Tella said: "Yesterday, in the boat (that transported the 
presidents to a luncheon) they were together and they chatted. 
The same thing may happen again." Di Tella quickly added, 
however, that a formal meeting is unlikely because conditions 
are not right. "Castro's position does not encourage anyone to 
speak seriously," the minister said 
  Di Tella talked with Argentine journalists covering the 
summit at this city's convention center at noon today. He 
recognized that the Argentine Government felt "very bad" about 
Castro's speech at the end of the ceremony yesterday. 
  Foreign Minister Di Tella, who does not hide his deep 
differences with Castro, said: "To say Cuba is being persecuted 
and that their entire situation is the consequence of U.S. 
persecution is like living on the moon." 
  Di Tella said: "Cuba is in very bad economic shape because 
its policies are very bad." The minister added: "The U.S. 
embargo, which the Cubans call a blockade, prevents them from 
purchasing from the United States, but not from Canada, Mexico, 
or Europe." 
  Regarding the situation on the island Di Tella said: "Their 
economy is a mess because of their policy that the state 
directs, contracts, and rations everything." 
  Di Tella stressed: "Cuba needs a qualitative change toward 
democracy and a change toward a market economy -- which started 
to appear but too timidly -- because the situation is on fire." 
  He said: "There is no point in talking about Cuba's entry 
into the Inter-American system until these changes take place. 
We expect Cuba to join the system later. I hope Castro will 
introduce those changes; if not, I think the situation will end 
dramatically." 
  The foreign minister said: "We do not want Cuba to be 
reincorporated into the OAS before it accepts democracy," 
because the organization "is a democratic club." 
  Di Tella thus answered criticism by Castro against his 
counterparts on 7 June for not pronouncing "a single word 
against the United States' criminal blockade" and for not 
reiterating the demand to democratize the island. [sentence as 
received] 
  "We respect your opinion and you should respect our 
opinion," 
said Castro during an impromptu speech last night when answering 
the insistent call of various presidents, among them the 
Argentine president, to introduce democracy in Cuba.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Miguel Angel Burelli said 
today that should Cuba want to join the OAS, it must comply with 
the rule of democracy, hold elections, and respect human rights. 
  Burelli told the media gathered at the Convention Center of 
Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), where the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit is taking place on 14 and 15 June, "America is a 
community that has a political system established by the OAS; 
there is a government philosophy and a rule of democracy." 
  He pointed out: "For Cuba to belong to this community, it 
must comply with the rule of democracy; that is, it must hold 
elections and respect human rights." He also pointed out he 
hopes Cuban President Fidel Castro "takes the necessary steps to 
join the community that is waiting for him." 
  Answering a question on whether Castro's move from wearing 
his green military uniform to wearing a guayabera shirt could be 
interpreted as a his willingness to make changes, Burelli 
replied: "I hope so!; I hope so!" This is the first time Castro 
has dressed in something other than his uniform since the Cuban 
Revolution succeeded in 1959. The Venezuelan foreign minister 
stressed his government "is very interested" in the Cuban 
economic changes, but it hopes these changes come along with 
"political changes." 
  During the summit's first session, Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera said: "The time has come" for Cuba to join the 
inter-American political and judicial systems and to change its 
political system. 
  Minister Burelli said the opposite with regard to Haiti: His 
government opposes any "unilateral or multilateral" military 
action in Haiti to put and end to the bitter crisis that is 
engulfing that country. Burelli also reported his government 
has requested the inclusion of the issue of corruption in the 
summit agenda in order to issue a resolution to prevent 
"granting asylum to corrupt people, just as drug traffickers are 
denied asylum."

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria today refrained from 
commenting on yesterday's speech by Cuban President Fidel Castro 
during the opening session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
of heads of state and government. Gaviria stressed that here 
"the people say what they feel." 
  Asked about Castro's speech during which he requested 
respect 
for his country's self-determination, the president, host of the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit being held in Cartagena de Indias, 
said that "those are Fidel Castro's speeches, and I believe the 
whole world has heard them." 
  "He said nothing new except for saying that he agrees with 
the Miami meeting and hoped it will go well," the Colombian 
president said when referring to the Cuban president's mention 
of the Summit of the Americas to be held in December in the 
United States. "I do not want to assess anyone's statements. 
Not Castro's or anyone else's. I believe that what had to 
happen happened at the meeting and that is that the talks were 
forthright and everyone said what they felt." 
  Gaviria today invited the Central American (Costa Rica, El 
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama) presidents 
to a working breakfast during which they discussed Colombia and 
Venezuela's commercial integration with Central America. "It 
was a meeting during which we studied the possibilities of 
making progress on an agreement that is already being discussed 
and which we hope will conclude shortly," the Colombian 
president said. 
  President Gaviria added that his government asked "the 
presidents, and their ministers, to try to ensure that political 
will prevailed in the conclusion of the agreement which we hope 
will be reached shortly." Gaviria said that they also talked 
"about something that is already under way and that is, 
Colombia's participation in the Central American Integration 
Bank," as well as the importance of absorbing the various 
processes of integration into one. 
  Gaviria, who met and lunched with the participants at the 
Ibero-American Summit behind closed doors at the Convention 
Center in Cartagena de Indias said that the presidents had made 
"much progress" in their discussions. Gaviria said: "We have 
made progress on topics that have to do with the position of 
each country in light of the problems of Ibero-America. We are 
going to make more progress with the agenda, and we are pleased 
with the way the meeting is going."

    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish between 1403 GMT and 1630 GMT on 15 June 
broadcasts approximately 42 minutes of brief recorded interviews 
with leaders attending the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads 
of State and Government in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. All 
the leaders interviewed -- Spanish Head of State Felipe 
Gonzalez, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria, and Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran-Ballen -- react to comments by their Cuban counterpart 
Fidel Castro Ruz. 
  Answering a question regarding Cuba's possible reinstatement 
into the OAS, Felipe Gonzalez says: "I believe Cuba can and 
should be reinstated to every institution on the continent. 
However, it would be a two-way process; not only would there be 
movement by the institutions toward Cuba but also by Cuba toward 
the institutions. I believe I have been clear on that." 
  Meanwhile, Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol argues 
that Castro brings up the blockade issue every time there is a 
call for political openness in Cuba. Calderon Sol says: "We 
want democracy and freedom in Cuba, and he has very cleverly 
resorted, as usual, to a discussion of the blockade that began 
during the sixties. In other words, the blockade is Mr. 
Castro's excuse when it comes to the issue of freedom." 
  Reporters also question Colombian President Cesar Gaviria 
about Fidel Castro's speech. Gaviria says it was quite similar 
to past speeches. Regarding Castro's remarks concerning 
democracy, Gaviria says: "Castro defends his understanding, his 
concept of democracy. The rest of us, obviously, do not share 
that concept." 
  Meanwhile, the situation in Cuba will be discussed by the 
presidents today. Upon his arrival at the convention center, 
Ecuadoran President Sixto Duran-Ballen is asked whether or not 
this discussion will hinder the normal development of the 
summit. He replies: "This summit is not a simple courtesy 
meeting, but a meeting to discuss hemispheric issues." In 
response to a question on Castro's assertion that Ibero-America 
is divided, Duran-Ballen says: "no, on the contrary, it is not."

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and Costa Rican 
President Jose Figueres stated today that they respect but do 
not share the opinion of their colleague Fidel Castro, who 
reproached the participants of the Ibero-American Summit for not 
saying "a single word" about the U.S. embargo against Cuba. 
  "I respect the opinion of President Castro, but do not agree 
with it, nor do I agree with his concept of what democracy is," 
de Leon told a group of newsmen. The Guatemalan president added 
that he does not feel he was recriminated by Castro at the 
summit. Castro also complained that the summit has not 
recognized the fact that Cuba is the Ibero-American country 
which has achieved the most in social aspects. 
  Asked about the same topic, Figueres responded that the 
Cuban 
president's statements "are his opinion, but not those of the 
other presidents," and that he respects all opinions. The Costa 
Rican president also said the political situations of Cuba and 
Haiti, which will be broached today by the chiefs of states and 
governments and their foreign ministers at a closed-door 
meeting, complicate the continent's integration processes.

  [Excerpts] East Timor has not been forgotten by the 21 
Ibero-American countries. The situation in the territory will 
be included in the final communique of the Colombian summit. 
  In Cartagena de Indias the Portuguese representatives 
expressed an interest in greater cooperation with Latin America. 
Among all the speeches there was harsh criticism of Cuba and 
Fidel Castro from Argentina and Venezuela. Our correspondent 
Antonio Prata reports. 
  [Begin recording] [Prata] [passage omitted] Despite the 
friendly hug between Fidel Castro and Portuguese Foreign 
Minister Durao Barroso, President Mario Soares and Prime 
Minister Cavaco Silva did not forget the situation on the 
island. For Soares, without a strong democracy there will be no 
development in Latin America. 
  [Soares] In order for the legitimate aspirations and 
expectations of the people to materialize, it is necessary for 
democracy to rest on solid foundations, giving rise to a 
balanced and equatable economic, social, and cultural 
development. 
  [Prata] A future which already includes trade development 
and 
an open process of regional integration--a phenomenon praised by 
Cavaco Silva: 
  [Silva] Therefore, I welcome the fact that the documents of 
this conference advocate the principle of open regionalism which 
adequately represents the different processes under way in 
Europe and in Latin America in the area of economic integration. 
  [Prata] Durao Barroso also advocated this cooperation 
between 
blocs. 
  [Barroso] In this modern world, which some believe is moving 
toward a concept of blocs, it is important to maintain these 
links between different blocs or different groups, and to this 
effect Portugal, as well as Spain, has been a link between 
Europe and, in this case, Latin America. 
  [Prata] [passage omitted] It seems certain that Portugal 
will 
host the 1998 summit, probably in Oporto. [end recording]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- 
Argentine President Carlos Menem has reported that Fidel Castro 
told his Latin American colleagues he will hold elections in 
Cuba when this continent becomes "integrated." 
  At a news conference in the aftermath of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit, which ended today in Cartagena, Menem 
commented on the talks the presidents have held on the Cuban 
issue and said that in order to readmit Cuba into the OAS, this 
country must first return to democracy. 
  Commenting on the same conversation on Cuba, Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria stressed the talks held with Castro and 
the hope for "gradual changes" on the island. However, Gaviria 
added the Cuban president could not be persuaded. 
  Menem refused to disclose what was said about Cuba during 
the 
closed-door meeting held today by the 23 leaders who attended 
the summit. 
  As for the conference declaration's last paragraph, which 
criticizes the "coercive" measures adopted to the detriment of 
some Ibero-American peoples, Menem said as soon as Cuba becomes 
democratic "we will exert pressure on the United States to end 
the blockade on the island." The Argentine president insisted 
"the only way Cuba can join the OAS is by establishing a 
democracy." However, Menem reported that the Cuban president 
said that "once America becomes integrated, he will hold 
elections to democratize the country." 
  As for Castro's statements, President Menem pointed out: 
"integration is what took place in Europe," recalling the case 
of Spain, where democracy arrived before being accepted into the 
EEC. 
  Meanwhile, President Gaviria stressed "we had never held 
talks on Cuba such as during these talks, and we all trust there 
will be a gradual change there; that is, we hope and expect a 
peaceful change to take place in Cuba." 
  The main issue at the news conference, also attended by 
Chilean President Eduardo Frei, was the same as that of the 
summit: Cuba. Fidel Castro was the talk of the town in Cartagena 
when he appeared wearing a guayabera shirt instead of his 
traditional army green uniform and when he angrily asked the 
presidents to respect his country as he respects theirs. 
  President Menem said today that the Ibero-American 
presidents 
are "anxious" to see democracy in Cuba, adding that that all 
depends on the Cubans themselves. 
  As for the next summit to be held in Argentina, Carlos Menem 
stressed he will extend an invitation to Castro, who has 
attended the four previous summits, and jokingly said: "Castro 
already sees we are indeed democratic." 
  As he emphasized the good atmosphere attained at the 
Ibero-American meeting, Gaviria pointed out the Cuban leader 
already speaks of "his good friend, President Menem." The 
Colombian president also commented on the different "positions" 
on the Cuban issue taken by the Ibero-American countries. 
However, he underscored that "the objective is the same: we all 
want political and economic changes in Cuba, and we all want 
Cuba to return to the inter-American system should these changes 
take place." 
  President Gaviria told EFE we all have tried to persuade 
Fidel Castro through dialogue, but there have been no 
"commitments" whatsoever.

  [Text] Brasilia, 15 Jun (AE) -- Presidential spokesman 
Fernando Costa announced that President Itamar Franco has been 
deeply shaken by the death of his nephew Ariosto Franco in 
Cartagena, Colombia. The president was informed early this 
morning that his nephew had suffered a heart attack. 
  Franco and the members of his entourage have canceled every 
appointment scheduled for today, and are preparing to return to 
Brazil as soon as Ariosto Franco's body is released. Franco's 
trip to Ecuador, which was scheduled to start on 16 June, has 
thus been canceled. A medical bulletin will soon be released on 
the death of the president's nephew. 
  [At 1438 GMT AGENCIA ESTADO adds that "in addition to being 
President Franco's private secretary," the 36-year-old Ariosto 
Carlos Franco "had been living with the president at Alvorada 
Palace."]

  He said he could not forget his fellow countrymen, the Paez 
Indians in Cauca and Huila Departments, who are currently 
suffering so much. Also, that he could not forget the 
solidarity of so many friendly countries as it allowed his 
brothers, who have been left without their dear ones and their 
belongings due to providence, to initiate their first steps 
toward a new life. This was what Colombian President Cesar 
Gaviria Trujillo said when he closed the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit. 
  Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who was the first 
president to refer to Cuba at the summit, again centered his 
closing speech on that island's political situation. Without 
mentioning the Cuban president, Mr. Menem emphasized the need 
that Latin America have freedom as its point of departure. 
  [Begin Menem recording] It can be a democracy based on the 
presidential, monarchic, or parliamentary systems, but it must 
be a democracy. [end recording] 
  Mr. Menem said there is no conflict between the market and 
the state and also underscored the importance of democracy as 
the fundamental factor to obtain the peace required for justice 
and freedom to rule. He added that if he were to be asked which 
of the four summits he thought had been best, he would answer 
that this one had, the one held in Cartagena, because of the 
topics that had been broached, the debates, the freedom, and the 
organization of the summit. It was an important and impressive 
summit, he said. In his final words, President Menem said 
freedom and democracy can only be strengthened with more 
democracy.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 15 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government, which 
has been meeting in this Caribbean city since Tuesday, today 
issued a final document in which it stresses its support for 
integration processes. 
  The document supports the integration processes "in the 
context of open regionalism" and rejects the restrictive free 
trade practices implemented by several governments to the 
detriment of the people. The summit conclusions are recorded in 
a two-part document: a first section entitled "Commerce and 
Integration as Elements in Ibero-American Development" and a 
second part that includes evaluations and proposals. 
  The text mentions that the reactivation of international 
commerce is basic to accessing equitable economic and social 
development and, for this reason, it condemns all policies for 
further protectionism or measures that limit freedom in 
international commerce. 
  The "Recommendations" chapter calls for "the elimination of 
restrictive commercial practices" as well as "the abusive and 
distorted use of commercial protection measures and tariff 
barriers" that limit free commerce. It is necessary to 
eliminate "unilateral coercive commercial and economic measures 
which hinder the possibility of freely developing international 
commerce and which damage the living conditions of the 
Ibero-American people," it adds. 
  This recommendation has been interpreted as a "clear censure 
of the blockade the United States has imposed on Cuba for the 
past 34 years" and which has been maintained after the end of 
the Cold War, diplomatic sources have asserted. 
  The conclusions manifest the need to support "the gradual 
convergence and complementariness of the different integration 
projects" to overcome differences and to take advantage of the 
potentials afforded by the economic opening. 
  The document also urges the defense of the environment "as 
an 
essential factor to the well-being of the population" and also 
calls on avoiding the use of ecological measures to further 
protectionism. 
  The fourth summit supports the "promotion of environmental 
policies as factors that will further the development of 
international commerce" as it will allow access to appropriate 
technologies and the flow of fresh financial resources to 
increase job opportunities. 
  The document proposes that the role of the state be 
redefined 
to enable governments to concentrate efforts on strategic areas 
for the benefit of the population. The document considers that 
the macroeconomic advances must be used to provide the resources 
for health, justice, education, infrastructure, and to "program 
an equitable social development." 
  It proposes the furtherance of actions that will strengthen 
or foster ties between nations and integration processes with 
the support of "citizen participation." "Europe has become 
Latin America's second leading commercial partner and Latin 
America is the first market for EU investments" and that is why 
"we must strengthen relations between the two areas," it adds. 
  The Fourth Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and 
government which ends this afternoon, sets new directions in 
regards to relations between the participant countries and the 
current objective is to increase commerce and consolidate the 
integrationist processes, the document points out.

  [Excerpts] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit is about to 
end. Here are some of the conclusions: Firm steps have been 
taken for a commercial integration between Colombia and Central 
America. This means in the next few years we will be able to 
place our goods and services in those countries, paying less 
taxes. Second, Latin American unity has been reaffirmed. 
Third, Cuba's strongman, Fidel Castro, became upset and annoyed 
because he did not get a resolution of support from Latin 
America condemning the U.S. economic blockade against the 
island. [passage omitted] 
  President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo has said the agreements 
reached during this fourth summit will be documented. He said: 
We will strengthen those agreements, and the OAS will be a good 
venue to carry out strategies to promote investments and trade 
as measures to combat poverty. 
  A few minutes before the closing ceremony, the Paraguayan 
Government proposed the creation of a Latin American institution 
of credits for exports, the main objective of which will be to 
facilitate insurance coverage of commercial risks derived from 
export operations among those countries; to offer protection 
against political risks in commercial transactions; to create an 
instrument for the progressive unification and integration of 
Ibero-American financial systems; and to constitute an 
additional factor of discipline and regional commercial fairness. 
  For UNICEF, the most positive aspect of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit has been the interest shown by all the 
presidents meeting here to put economic models at the service of 
society, the individual, and human beings. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- More 
than six of Cuban President Fidel Castro's bodyguards had to 
cram into a station wagon today to flee a group of reporters, 
who were seeking an explanation as to why the bodyguards had 
earlier attacked several cameramen. 
  Reporters and bodyguards exchanged strong insults and even a 
few blows while the Cubans' station wagon quickly pulled away 
amid jeers from the reporters. The reporters had tried to film 
and interview the bodyguards after they attacked a group of 
cameramen who tried to talk with Castro at the entrance of the 
Hilton Hotel in Cartagena, where guests attending the Fourth 
Ibero-Ameican Summit are lodged. 
  The incident started when Nicaraguan President Violeta 
Chamorro stopped to make statements at the foot of the stairs, 
which were being descended by the heads of state who had just 
held a number of bilateral meetings before the second session of 
the summit. At that moment, one of the television reporters 
brought a microphone close to Castro, who was waiting behind 
Chamorro, but Castro's bodyguards reacted violently, and, 
according to eyewitnesses, a fracas ensued, first with an 
exchange of insults, then blows. 
  From amid a maelstrom of Cuban security agents and 
reporters, 
one Argentine cameraman shouted in anguish: "You must not hit 
reporters. You must not hit reporters." The incident took place 
in front of several astonished and concerned presidents, foreign 
ministers, and Colombian officials. 
  When the situation calmed down and the presidents left for 
the Cartagena Convention Center, the reporters went looking for 
the bodyguards and chased them down -- cameras and microphones 
in hand -- in the vicinity of the Hilton. Finally the group of 
bodyguards, some of whom were accused of having caused similar 
incidents at previous summits, hastily got into a station wagon 
amid shouts of "This is not Cuba; reporters are respected here." 
  Reporters covering the Ibero-American Summit have 
encountered 
difficulties because of security measures that have been 
described as excessive. On Tuesday, they complained to the 
Colombian authorities who, nevertheless, refused to modify the 
strict rules concerning access to the leaders.

  [Text] To ensure protection for the visiting heads of state 
and delegations, the Colombian military have joined in a single 
strategy and are receiving support from everyone in the country. 
For example, 50 escort motorcycles arrived from Santa Fe de 
Bogota, and a month ago, for greater tranquility, the Colombian 
military met with the heads of security for each of the visiting 
presidents. The last preparations for the security plan 
resulted from these meetings. Even though the plan was for the 
city not to appear to be militarized, it is impossible to 
camouflage the work being done on the ground, in the air, and on 
the water by the 3,000 men who are responsible for ensuring the 
safety of the visiting heads of state.

  [Text] President Carlos Menem spoke yesterday before the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. 
He took the opportunity to demand democracy for Cuba right in 
front of Fidel Castro, to highlight the changes in Argentina 
since 1989, and to reject abortion. In his seven-minute speech 
-- the time allowed for the presidents to express their position 
-- Menem called for a political "change" in Cuba based on a 
request made earlier to Castro by Venezuelan President Rafael 
Caldera. He concluded his message calling on the 21 heads of 
state and government to speak out against abortion. "No Latin 
American government has been able to develop under a 
dictatorship or totalitarianism, which are systems that have 
completely failed" said Menem in reference to the situation in 
Cuba. "I understand that perhaps in some countries those 
conditions do not exist but that depends on each of those 
countries, and it is not my intention to meddle in the affairs 
of other countries." Menem was quick to clarify that he had not 
made a special reference to Cuba. 
  After recalling that he also suffered "imprisonment, 
persecution, and torture," like some of his colleagues, Menem 
emphasized: "The Venezuelan president (Caldera) referred to this 
issue. With great affection and love I also call on this friend 
who is the commander of Cuba, under the same terms and form, on 
the need for change in Cuba which is a country we all love." 
Menem never mentioned the name Castro and only identified him 
as "the commander of Cuba." He spoke at noon yesterday. He was 
the third speaker after Fidel Castro spoke. The first session 
was interrupted for a few minutes over a special request by 
Menem to the summit president, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria 
Trujillo. Following Gaviria's address, the speakers were 
Brazil's Itamar Franco, Uruguay's Luis Lacalle, Guatemala's 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio, Venezuela's Rafael Caldera, Cuba's Fidel 
Castro (who harshly criticized the United States), Ecuador's 
Sixto Ballen, Panama's Guillermo Endara, and Carlos Menem whose 
speech was delayed for a few minutes after Gaviria granted the 
brief recess he requested. 
  Menem's speech first covered economic matters, which is one 
of the main issues of the summit that will close this evening 
when Menem will deliver another speech, as will Gaviria, because 
Argentina will host the next summit. Unexpectedly and based on 
the mention by Venezuela's Caldera, President Menem talked about 
dictatorships and could not avoid referring to the Cuban issue. 
Menem returned to his prepared speech to talk about the state 
reform. He said: "Based on our experience, I can say that a 
reform strengthens the state in such a way that it can begin a 
process of profound economic change." 
  Directly addressing President Gaviria, who spoke on this 
issue, Menem pointed out that in Argentina "we are conducting an 
all-out struggle against corruption. Argentina has completely 
changed its history with the state reform." He emphasized that 
"every enterprise that we have privatized was a monument to 
corruption." The privatizations "have given us an opportunity to 
begin a new stage with growth and development, and to fight the 
worst scourge that could hit a community which is 
hyperinflation." Menem wore white pants and a light blue shirt 
as the meeting was informal. He compared the $60 million in the 
safe of the Central Bank when he assumed the government with the 
current $18 billion. He added: "We have made some great 
achievements, and those who say this is just some kind of 
adjustment policy are lying." He said: "Argentina has the 
greatest growth in the western world and is third at the global 
level thanks to the state reform, a market economy, and a strong 
fiscal adjustment." 
  President Menem took this opportunity to urge the summit to 
speak out against abortion. Menem said the leaders will 
probably talk about "human rights, democracy, freedom ..." He 
then paused for a deep breath and said: "The protection of life. 
For me, and I hope the other presidents agree, life begins at 
the moment of conception in the mother's womb." Menem added: 
"These issues related to man's dignity will be discussed and 
talked about." He was applaused by those attending the summit.

<F P=106> [Article by Correspondent Tania Monetiro] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena, 14 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco 
today gave an optimistic speech regarding the implementation of 
the economic stabilization plan during the opening session of 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Chiefs of State and 
Government. "The Brazilian economic stabilization program meets 
the political and economic demands of openness and fiscal 
balance which are essential to correct the serious distortions 
caused by the high interest rate we are enduring," President 
Itamar said. In reply to those who say that the economic 
measures are aimed at helping Fernando Henrique Cardoso's 
candidacy for president of the Republic, President Itamar took 
the opportunity to point out that the economic plan "is not 
aimed at short-term goals; it attempts to make the Brazilian 
people recover their confidence in the future." 
  Meanwhile, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said 
during an interview that it is not enough for Brazil to follow a 
correct path to consolidate the economic plan. "The 
international environment should also be favorable," he said. 
Amorim today commented ironically on an article published in the 
Colombian press which stated that Brazil is the inflation champ 
in the American continent. He said: "That is so only until 1 
July," after which he added that in two, three, or four months 
the situation of Brazil will be privileged. Amorim added that 
despite the high inflation, one-third of foreign investments in 
Latin America are invested in Brazil, even before the economy 
stabilizes. 
  In his speech, President Itamar mentioned the government 
measures to make the state efficient. "The people and the 
government are united with the same determination. We no longer 
permit the antiethical behavior that threatened the foundations 
of civilian society," the president said. Franco said that the 
economic plan is entering a decisive stage and that it will soon 
establish a new macroeconomic standard in the country. 
  During his speech, Itamar took the opportunity to enumerate 
the accomplishments of his administration during the past 18 
months. He mentioned that the Brazilian GDP increased by 5 
percent last year and that the same rhythm of growth will be 
maintained this year. Brazilian foreign trade is experiencing an 
unprecedented openness. "We abolished all the non-tariff 
barriers on imports; we reduced the average import tax from 54 
percent to 14 percent." The president also mentioned the 
exchange reserves which amount to approximately $38 billion, the 
76 million tonne agricultural harvest, and the 9.6 percent 
industrial recovery. He also mentioned the Brazilian foreign 
debt agreement with the international financial community. 
  For Franco, "stability is not an objective by itself." He 
added: "The resumption of growth cannot be isolated from 
policies that comprise a social dimension." According to Itamar, 
the benefits of modernization should reach everyone. "Social 
exclusion, poverty, and hunger must be eliminated from our 
countries and the world, because the presence of these evils 
weakens our society and undermines international cohesion," he 
said. 
  President Itamar also directly alluded to the 3 October 
elections: "During a pre-election period, which must yield 
important results for the future of Brazil, we are witnessing a 
process of political maturity among our citizens, with the 
certainty that democratic conviction will be the great winner in 
this electoral dispute," he said.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Guillermo Endara by correspondent </F>
Guillermo Rodriguez and Caracol News Director Dario Arizmendi in 
the India Catalina Convention Center in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia -- live] 
  [Text] [Rodriguez] Mr. President Endara, good morning. 
It's a pleasure to greet you. 
  [Endara] Thank you very much. Good morning to all of you. I 
wish you the best. I feel very well here in Colombia. It has 
been very pleasant for me these last couple of days to be with 
President Gaviria, with Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, two people 
whom I shall always remember because of the friendship they have 
bestowed on me and on the Republic of Panama. 
  [Rodriguez] I understand that the last armed soldier left 
the 
Canal Zone and that there are no longer U.S. soldiers? 
  [Endara] Yes, that is right, but not armed soldiers, because 
all soldiers are armed. The last combat soldier left. It was a 
combat brigade that left. That was the last combat brigade. 
There are soldiers left. Although they have weapons, they are 
not combat weapons. There are, for instance, the military 
police, the doctors, and other essential components. 
  [Rodriguez] Mr. President, undoubtedly one of the topics to 
be analyzed and one which is of interest here at this summit, 
although it is not on the agenda as the presidents said from the 
beginning, is the topic of Cuba, the topic of President Fidel 
Castro. Yesterday, in his second speech he said that if one 
wants to speak of democracy in Latin America, another summit 
like this one would have to be held in his country. What is 
your opinion? 
  [Endara] I think we are quite clear on what democracy 
signifies. Of course, he has declared himself to be a 
Marxist-Leninist, and he has another concept of democracy, which 
we are acquainted with after meeting people who subscribe to 
this ideology. Of course, we have always respected that concept 
of democracy, although we may not agree with that proletarian 
dictatorship that we believe is fundamentally undemocratic. I 
think there is much truth in what Commander Fidel Castro said, 
but there is also much truth in what was said by the presidents 
of Chile, Honduras, and I don't remember who else, but they all 
stated some truths. We envision a democracy as one in which the 
people express themselves through elections or express 
themselves through freedom of speech, manifesting total support 
of human rights, which unfortunately is nonexistent in Cuba. We 
have to discuss this with him, and I believe we will have an 
opportunity to do so this afternoon. 
  [Rodriguez] Dario Arizmendi, President Endara is there. 
  [Arizmendi] Greetings to the president of Panama. Mr. 
President, what will be the outcome of the topic raised by Cuban 
President Fidel Castro yesterday when he criticized precisely 
the rest of the Latin American presidents for not dedicating a 
single sentence of their 15-minute speeches to the U.S.-imposed 
blockade against Cuba? 
  [Endara] I believe the criticism was not directed against 
all 
the presidents. I believe the criticism was... [pauses] it was 
a very friendly criticism. I don't know if you had the 
opportunity to hear what he said. It was very friendly 
criticism. He referred especially to those presidents who 
referred in their speeches to freedom and democracy in Cuba. He 
maintains that, in addition to mentioning that, they should have 
mentioned the blockade, the great achievements by Cuba in social 
aspects, particularly in terms of medicine and education. I 
believe that Castro is suffering from these truths, but the 
presidents also mentioned other truths which is that these big 
social achievements must go hand in hand with what we understand 
as democracy and liberty, as exists here in Colombia, for 
instance, and in the other Latin American countries. 
  [Arizmendi] President Endara, do you think it is possible 
that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit declaration of Cartagena 
de Indias will include an explicit paragraph, precisely 
regarding the blockade against Cuba? 
  [Endara] I don't believe so. I believe this is a topic we 
are going to broach, that is if we broach it again it will be at 
a private meeting attended by the presidents and foreign 
ministers. Now that is not the only topic we are going to 
discuss in this private meeting. We will broach other topics, 
which we could perhaps mention at a given moment, but we cannot 
at this moment. 
  [Arizmendi] We imagine that the case of Haiti will also be 
on 
the agenda of that private meeting, won't it? 
  [Endara] I don't believe so. I cannot say that there is no 
country that wants to broach it, but I don't think so. This is 
a topic fundamentally for the OAS, and it was discussed in 
Belem, Brazil, only a few days ago. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, do you think that the 
summits are going to be institutionalized and that this one has 
been more fruitful than previous ones? 
  [Endara] Yes, of course. I believe that one of the great 
achievements of the summit in Cartagena de Indias has been 
institutionalizing the summits. It is now taken for granted 
that the summits will remain as a permanent thing in our 
countries. The fact that we have the host countries up to the 
year 2001 is a clear indication of the interest in maintaining 
them. I think that the great achievement, the preliminary 
achievement of the summit of Cartagena de Indias is precisely 
that. The first three summits were to sound out the situation 
to see if they were successful. Here in Cartagena de Indias it 
has been proven that the summits are like one of those big trees 
that will flourish and have many flowers. 
  [Arizmendi] One last question, Mr. Guillermo Endara, and 
expressing our thanks in behalf of our program, what will you 
dedicate yourself to when you turn over power in the coming 
weeks? 
  [Endara] I will return to my law practice. Former presidents 
do not receive any pension or privilege in Panama. I think the 
only thing they get is a large automobile license plate, which I 
would rather pay for. I will dedicate myself to my law 
practice, which is what I have done all my life. Of course, I 
will not leave politics, although there is no reelection until 
after 10 years. Still, it is crazy to think of 10 years ahead. 
I will dedicate myself to my party, which is a very large and 
good party. As of now I can anticipate, without fear of being 
wrong, that in the year 1999, the Arnulfist Party, with the same 
candidate it had this year, Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, is going 
to win by a broad, a very broad margin. 
  [Arizmendi] Mr. President of Panama, thank you very much for 
being with us. We hope that the rest of your stay with us will 
be a very pleasant one. 
  [Endara] Thank you very much.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (Notimex) -- Cuban 
parliament leader Ricardo Alarcon said today that the Summit of 
the Americas will represent "a challenge and an opportunity" 
because it may suggest a desire on the part of the United States 
to restate its relations with the region. 
  Alarcon said the meeting -- requested by the United States 
and scheduled for December in Miami, Florida -- is "a source of 
concern" because there have been no consultations to establish a 
date, agenda, and possible resolutions for the meeting. 
  This failure to establish the content of the meeting 
"deserves the deepest thought," said Alarcon, who was a member 
of the Cuban delegation to the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of 
Heads of State and Government, which ended yesterday in 
Cartagena de Indias. 
  The former Cuban foreign minister said the U.S. Government 
talks "of a new system of relations regarding security, which 
would not be based on troops and military bases," and also of 
having "good intentions where trade is concerned." 
  "The fact that Cuba and Haiti will not attend the 
hemispheric 
meeting will not undermine its merits, if something like this is 
accomplished," he said. However, "if this is not the case, 
there might be cause for even greater concern." 
  The president of the Cuban National Assembly of the Peoples 
Government told reporters he has reservations because the 
summons to the meeting comes "from the place that has summoned 
the countries of the region that have hidden agendas." 
  In my opinion the presence of U.S. OAS Ambassador Harriet 
Babbit at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit was disadvantageous 
because the forum has thus far abstained from granting observer 
status to third country governments. 
  "Babbit is involved in the organization of the Miami Summit 
for purposes that may differ from the original plan," he said. 
  Alarcon explained that due to this situation Cuban President 
Fidel Castro expressed in his speech at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit on Tuesday, "certain ideas which we 
believe Latin America should discuss" at the Miami meeting. 
  Castro denied that Cuba will oppose the Summit of the 
Americas, adding that "we are pleased that our neighboring 
countries of Latin America and the Caribbean can firmly and 
vigorously defend our peoples' interest at that meeting." 
  The Cuban leader remains in Cartagena de Indias -- a port on 
Colombia's Caribbean coast, 1,200 km north of Bogota -- where he 
plans to hold bilateral meetings on Thursday with other regional 
leaders.

  [Excerpts] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 16 Jun (EFE) -- 
The Central American presidents, who had planned to meet with 
Cuban President Fidel Castro today to request the island's 
democratization, have decided not to hold the meeting in light 
of the reluctance of several presidents who have not forgotten 
the role Havana once played in their region. 
  Although the official explanation of the cancellation of the 
meeting was "agenda problems," different Central American 
sources said several presidents did not want to meet Castro 
because of the scant affinity they feel toward him because of 
his support for the now nearly extinct guerrilla movements on 
the isthmus. 
  Salvadoran sources told EFE that, in particular, for 
President Armando Calderon Sol of the right-wing ARENA 
[Nationalist Republican Alliance], such a meeting would have 
been difficult. Even though peace has come to El Salvador, it 
would have been objectionable for Calderon Sol to meet with one 
of the politicians who fostered the military conflict in El 
Salvador. 
  Calderon Sol, who took office on 1 June, today said Cuba 
still has a long way to go in terms of encouraging freedom and 
democracy. He added that as long as Cuba does not create more 
opportunities for freedom, there will be no progress in 
cooperation with the island. 
  "All of us who love democracy and expect respect for human 
dignity must raise this topic (at the summits)," the Salvadoran 
president added. [passage omitted] 
  Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres today commented on 
the failed meeting with the Cuban leader by saying it was not 
held "because the topics we would have addressed with President 
Castro were broadly reviewed at the (summit's) private session 
on Wednesday afternoon." 
  Officially, Honduran Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal [title as 
received] and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo told 
EFE that agenda problems and the presidents' departure for their 
home nations today made the meeting with Castro impossible. 
This meeting had sparked interest because the six Central 
American presidents, who met Monday in Costa Rica to prepare a 
joint position on the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, had issued 
in San Jose a communique asking for Cuba's democratization.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Honduran correspondents invited by 
the government to travel to Cartagena de Indias reported that 
despite President Carlos Roberto Reina having said that he would 
not meet with his counterpart Fidel Castro, the Honduran 
president was unexpectedly visited in his suite by the Cuban 
president. 
  After a 20-minute conversation with the Cuban leader, Reina 
stated that should Cuba rejoin the Organization of American 
States (OAS), it would represent a "great victory for America." 
  The Honduran president pointed out that the proposal made by 
Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, and Colombia with respect to a 
transition to democracy taking place in Cuba, is viewed "from 
another perspective" by Cuban President Fidel Castro. 
  In reference to the pressures that could be applied by the 
Central American countries for Cuba to be readmitted into the 
OAS, and for the United States to lift the embargo against that 
nation, Reina pointed out that "Cuba was a country penalized by 
the OAS which is the organization that has allowed countries the 
independence to establish diplomatic relations. However, 
President Fidel Castro sees it from another perspective." 
  According to the Honduran president, Cuba must again be a 
"full" OAS member. "I believe that Costa Rican President 
Figueres' proposal to solve these two issues can be solved in 
just one day. There is no more cold war, no reason to continue 
with the blockade, because now there are all sorts of democratic 
legal provisions offered by the Inter-American system. Cuba, as 
a country that has had all sorts of problems, can return to 
become a full OAS member."

about the Cuban [as heard] situation. 
  [Morales] What is not being said is that we, Dominicans, are 
the hardest hit by the Haitian situation. As a result of the 
continuing Haitian problem, our country has over 1 million 
illegal Haitian residents, which constitutes an extremely heavy 
burden. We support a prompt, but democratic solution.

  [Text] Let us now report on President Gonzalo Sanchez de 
Lozada's participation in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] President Gonzalo 
Sanchez de Lozada held a working breakfast meeting with Chilean 
President Eduardo Frei this morning. The two presidents 
discussed such issues as exports and the Bolivian claim to the 
sea coast. 
  [Sanchez] We discussed it, we looked at it, and we said that 
this is a current problem. How can we solve it? The solution 
has not... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly] 
  [Reporter] The foreign media asked President Sanchez if a 
sea 
outlet was the only way for Bolivia to integrate itself into a 
modern economy. 
  [Sanchez] The sea outlet is the only way, but this is not 
necessarily related to... [Sanchez recording ends abruptly] 
  [Reporter] In addition to the issue of the sea outlet, other 
important issues for the two countries were also discussed. 
  [Frei] Issues such as economic complementation, physical 
integration, seeking common positions on matters of education, 
and joint binational projects such as natural gas, which is an 
important energy issue for Bolivia. 
  [Reporter] How would you label this meeting? 
  [Frei] Positive and very cordial. 
  [Reporter] The result of the working breakfast meeting 
between the two presidents was the preparation of an agenda for 
the two foreign ministries. [end recording] 
  The meeting was positive and cordial, an important meeting. 
There are differences, and we are under the impression that 
President Frei recognizes them despite the Chilean official 
position that Chile has nothing pending with Bolivia. There is 
a long way to go, but this process, which we believe is 
loosening up, is a good one, without illusions but with clear 
ideas. Let us now listen to Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at the 
Ibero-American Summit: 
  [Begin recording] [Reporter] Are there plans for a new 
meeting between the Bolivian and Chilean presidents next 
September? 
  [Sanchez] Yes, that is true, and a request was made to the 
foreign ministries to prepare an agenda for the different 
committees to start working, looking at the problems. The sea 
issue was raised, but we did not make any progress on that 
point. We want to make progress on all issues, including the 
sea issue. 
  [Reporter] What about natural gas? 
  [Sanchez] The natural gas issue was also definitely raised, 
and there seems to be a very good predisposition and some 
contacts with Chilean state companies. This kind of negotiation 
seems to be the best way for people who are used to working on 
projects, and not to getting involved in diplomatic subtleties. 
  [Reporter] Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada labeled the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit positive. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Jaime Guerrero from Cartagena de Indias] </F>
  [Text] Last night, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
arrived in Mexico from Colombia, where he participated in the 
Fourth Ibero-American Summit. At the end of the meeting in 
Cartagena de Indias, the Latin American presidents endorsed a 
proposal to appoint Salinas as head of the World Trade 
Directorate, which will replace GATT next year. 
  Ibero-America is not free from risk. In the presence of 
Ibero-American heads of state and government, Salinas warned 
that industrialized countries want to impose social dumping on 
developing countries. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] They want to blame us for selling 
at lower prices and failing to adhere to environmental 
protection and labor standards. [end recording] 
  Salinas said that trade and investment provide the only 
means 
to meet the region's urgent need for growth. His participation 
in promoting the Cartagena Summit was acknowledged. In this 
framework, Argentina proposed Salinas to head the World Trade 
Directorate, which will replace GATT next year. The proposal 
was accepted by the rest of the Latin American countries. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The organization is in a stage of 
formation and is expected to become fully operational only next 
year. For this reason, I affirm that I am fully devoted to my 
duty to serve the Mexican people, and I will continue to do so 
until 30 November 1994. [end recording] 
  Salinas described as encouraging the outcome of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit. Regarding the controversy on Cuba, which 
was urged to move toward democracy, Salinas said this. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] When the Ibero-American Summit was 
promoted, it was never expected that there would be a consensus 
among those attending the meeting. Instead, the idea was that, 
within the framework of the plurality that marks us, we would be 
able to agree on similar purposes and goals. [end recording] 
  The summit has come to an end. The Ibero-American countries 
know that they must be integrated into subregional markets, 
otherwise the world trade changes will carry them away.

<F P=106> [Interview with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari </F>
by XEW correspondent Felix Cortes in Cartagena de Indias; date 
not given; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Cortes] At the conclusion of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit here in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will not prepare for 
the fifth summit, which will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 
in a year. Mr. President, I would like to have a human reaction 
on the part of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a political 
assessment. How does it feel to leave a creature, in whose 
gestation, birth, growth, and development you had a primary 
role, now that that creature has learned how to walk. 
  [Salinas] The most important thing is for initiatives to 
become institutions. For the first time in history, in fact, 
all the chiefs of state and government of the Ibero-American 
nations met in 1991 in Guadalajara; this served as a formidable 
backdrop. The residents of that city showed their generosity, 
enthusiasm, and hospitality and served as an exceptional 
framework for that first Ibero-American summit. For me it is 
truly encouraging that what emerged first as an idea, as a mere 
proposal, later became in Guadalajara this Ibero-American 
initiative, confirming that Mexico does not forget its roots 
when it envisions the future. 
  [Cortes] A document, which all the participants at the 
Cartagena de Indias summit signed, recognizes the work of Mexico 
and the work of Carlos Salinas de Gortari in being capable of 
convoking what has turned out to be a reality, which someone 
five years ago would have said was impossible to achieve. The 
mere gathering of diverse personalities -- often showing 
unnoticeable differences and other times a marked contrast -- 
sitting down at the same table is a triumph. Specifically, 
however, what were the achievements of the previous three 
summits and this one in Cartagena de Indias in particular? 
  [Salinas] The specific agreements are twofold. The first is 
that it was confirmed that a state of pluralism in the 
representation of chiefs of state and government at this 
Ibero-American summit could exist and still yield common goals. 
In other words, common purposes can be built amid diversity. I 
have always believed in pluralism. I also believe that 
diversity can be transformed into a similar purpose to achieve 
better living standards for our peoples. This was demonstrated 
in the Ibero-American summit in Guadalajara and in subsequent 
summits: the one in Madrid in 1992, the one in Salvador de 
Bahia, Brazil, in 1993, and this one in Cartagena de Indias in 
1994. This is the first concrete result. Political dialogue 
within the framework of pluralism permits achieving common 
objectives. The second concrete result is that, through this 
framework of achieving consensus and dialogue, which have marked 
the Ibero-American Summit, we have managed to secure concrete 
initiatives. This has resulted in the opening of bigger markets 
and the possibility of selling more of our products and 
increasing trade and has meant the creation of more jobs and 
more opportunities for more Mexicans. 
  [Cortes] Mr. President, all of those who have been sitting 
around that table during these two days agree on the 
fundamentals. They agree on the necessity of free trade, 
cooperation, understanding, exchanges, rapprochement, and 
cordiality. When one reaches a thorny topic, as is the Cuban 
political system, then not everybody has similar views. Would 
you say, as some observers have said, that this Ibero-American 
community, although it sits at the same table, is divided? 
  [Salinas] I would say that we never sought uniformity. What 
we sought, I repeat, recognizing the pluralism of systems in the 
region, was to find common points of agreement. The results 
show that it is possible to find similar goals, despite the 
diversities and differences in the political systems of the 
region. If there is respect and recognition of the existing 
pluralism -- we have demonstrated they exist -- one can reach 
such consensus. We never intended to have any country similar 
to another or to be a clone of another system. No, recognizing 
the differences, we wished to stress that we have common roots 
and similar desires. 
  [Cortes] Finally, Mr. President, are you saddened by the 
fact 
that you will not continue to attend these meetings? 
  [Salinas] Well, the meetings will continue to be held as 
part 
of their institutional structure. I must tell you that I am 
leaving very animated by these meetings. I am stimulated by the 
existing recognition of our Mexico. It is important to 
underscore this, because in recent months we have experienced 
difficult times, tragic and sad moments. Despite this, however, 
there is broad recognition internationally of what Mexico has 
constructed with great effort in recent years. Without failing 
to recognize the challenges and problems that we face, we can 
count on the fact that there is recognition of our work and of 
Mexican realities, which are many and varied in different 
fields. That is truly encouraging. 
  [Cortes] Don Carlos, thank you very much.

  [Trujillo] Good evening. This is to report that a few 
minutes ago President Carlos Salinas de Gortari left Cartagena 
to return to Mexico. 
  [Zabludovsky] At what time did he leave? 
  [Trujillo] He departed at 2040, sir, from the presidential 
hangar. We asked him two questions. He said that Latin 
American integration is truly progressing. He termed his visit 
to Colombia and Cuba as very fruitful, an example of which he 
said was the free trade agreement signed by Mexico, Venezuela, 
and Colombia. That is the report, sir. 
  [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much.

<F P=106> [By Alejandro Mendez] </F>
  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 16 Jun (EFE) -- 
Diplomacy has again rearranged words and has resorted to the 
"fine print" of international agreements to overcome points of 
discrepancy among the 21 countries that signed the "Declaration 
of Cartagena de Indias." 
  The situation of Cuba and the "landlocked position" of 
Bolivia and Paraguay were the cause of difficult negotiations 
among the foreign ministers of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, 
which concluded Wednesday in the Colombian Caribbean city of 
Cartagena de Indias, according to different diplomatic sources. 
  Another thorny issue was the Argentine proposal to include 
an 
antiabortion statement, which was debated under the umbrella of 
the "defense of human life" to which the declaration finally 
alluded. The negotiations led to a change in the text, which 
toned down the implicit all-out defense of privatization that 
appeared in the preliminary drafts of the document. 
  Also, the recommendation to prevent an "excessive emphasis" 
on economic adjustment plans, which could affect state help to 
the neediest population, was eliminated from the draft. The 
corrected and eliminated points were a source of irritation to 
countries, such as Argentina, which have seen their levels of 
absolute poverty and unemployment rise, despite a parallel 
growth of the gross national product achieved through fiscal 
austerity. 
  The document, which maintained the neoliberal aspect of the 
policies that are applied by the majority of the countries, was 
signed by Cuban leader Fidel Castro, in exchange for a more 
vigorous mention of the U.S. embargo against the island. The 
mention of Cuba, although indirect, includes the words 
"coercive" and "unilateral," which happens for the first time in 
an Ibero-American statement since the "summits" began four years 
ago in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. 
  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, who organized and hosted 
the event, asked that the "landlocked" topic that annoys Chile 
be discussed by the foreign ministers of that country, together 
with the foreign ministers of Paraguay and Bolivia. Bolivians 
have claimed formally since 1979 the territories on the Pacific 
Ocean that they lost to the Chileans in a war last century. The 
controversy was unleashed by the recommendation to "seek more 
favorable conditions for countries of relatively less 
development," with a "special" mention of the "landlocked" 
position of Paraguay and Bolivia. 
  The foreign ministers struck out the names of Paraguay and 
Bolivia and replaced the controversial wording with "the factors 
of the geographical situation referred to in the last paragraph 
of Article 18 of the 1980 Montevideo Treaty (ALADI)," that is 
the unnamed "landlocked" situation. Argentine President Carlos 
Menem promised Pope John Paul II he would promote an 
Ibero-American condemnation of abortion, with a view to the 
upcoming World Conference on Population and Development that 
will be held this coming September in Cairo. 
  Laws in Spain, Portugal, and Mexico, however, give women the 
right to resort to abortion under given conditions. This 
precluded reaching a unanimous decision. The matter was 
overcome at the last minute with the inclusion of the 
"commitment" to "respect the right of human life, the right to 
health, and the quality of life of mothers and children" and "to 
contribute in an relevant manner" to the meeting in Cairo.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Rafael Caldera has said the bolivar 
fluctuations will not affect the future of the Group of Three 
[G-3] free trade agreement. He made this statement at a joint 
news conference in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where the G-3 
countries are meeting and where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
is taking place. 
  [Begin Caldera recording] Bolivar fluctuations will not 
affect the G-3 free trade agreement, because there will always 
be ways to prevent any eventuality from obstructing the basic 
element: trade among sister nations. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria has said the 
trade agreement will come into effect soon due to the rules 
previously stipulated in the treaty signed by Venezuela, 
Colombia, and Mexico. The first reaction to this treaty will 
come from investors of the three countries. 
  [Begin Gaviria recording] Although an immediate deregulation 
was included in the agreement, the G-3 free trade agreement is 
of utmost importance for a number of products. We must bear in 
mind the lifting of customs duties will take 10 years; this is 
why free trade will be progressive. I believe, however, the 
same thing that happened when Mexico signed a free trade 
agreement with Chile will happen again: the doubling in trade 
within a year, because the expectations and clear-cut rules have 
made businessmen aware that there were regulations that would 
control trade and make trade grow. We hope the agreement among 
Venezuela, Colombia, and Mexico will yield very significant 
results soon. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
said the prospects of this agreement regarding larger markets 
and production are compelling mechanisms with which to defeat 
poverty. The Aztec head of state was questioned about the G-3's 
contribution to help fight poverty. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We in Mexico are convinced the 
only 
way to permanently defeat poverty is to recover sustained 
economic growth, because without well-paying jobs there are no 
possibilities of permanently eradicating poverty. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel </F>
Santos and Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas by 
unidentified reporters at the Cartagena Convention Center in 
Cartagena; from the "National Newscast" -- live] 
  [Text] [Reporter] Minister Juan Manuel Santos, from your 
perspective as foreign trade minister, what have been the most 
important aspects of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit? 
  [Santos] First of all, the signing of the G-3 [Group of 
Three 
-- Colombia, Venezuela, and Mexico] Agreement. As President 
Gaviria said, it is the most important trade agreement in 
Colombian history. This was a specific achievement. Another 
important point is that the main subject of the summit was 
integration and commerce. For us, it has been very satisfying to 
see that what we have been doing for the past two or three years 
is precisely what all the other Ibero-American countries want to 
do: promote integration and free trade, create more jobs, 
increase production. The conclusion of this summit in the areas 
of commerce and integration totally coincide with Colombian 
policies. Therefore, it has been very satisfactory for us to 
see that what we have done during the past three years is 
supported at the Ibero-American and international levels. 
  [Reporter] We will now interview Development Minister 
Mauricio Cardenas on today's working session. What are the 
plans for investment and development for these countries? 
  [Cardenas] We had a very interesting meeting this morning, 
during which Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and 
Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez presented important 
recommendations on ways to accelerate economic growth in Latin 
America. We believe it is fundamental to follow up on the 
proposed initiatives with special emphasis on social investment, 
particularly on education. Those aspects are considered 
necessary to accelerate economic development in our region and 
to enable us to achieve an annual economic growth rate of 7 or 8 
percent, which is the goal of all Latin American countries.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) -- 
Forty American human rights organizations today asked Uruguayan 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle to review his decision to allow a 
private television monopoly in his country. 
  The human rights organizations' petition agrees with another 
petition signed by 23 Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese 
newspaper directors who participated in a press seminar in 
Cartagena de Indias, where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is 
being held. 
  Luis Alberto Lacalle signed a decree three months ago 
approving cable television operations by a private group that 
dominates Montevideo's three open channels. 
  A communique issued by these human rights organizations 
points out that the presidential decision, which is under 
congressional investigation, "effects the right to gain 
information and to report with no other restrictions than those 
established by law." 
  The communique bears the signatures of representatives from 
the Latin American Institute for Alternative Legal Services 
[Instituto Latinoamericano de Servicios Legales Alternativos] 
(ILSA), the Peace and Justice Service (Serpaj) of Argentina, and 
the Caribbean Human Rights (CAR) organization of the Caribbean 
English-speaking countries. 
  The human rights organizations, all of them 
non-governmental, 
met in Cartagena de Indias to review the policies currently 
implemented by the Latin American countries while their 
respective heads of state and heads of government were holding a 
"summit." 
  Newspaper directors, including those of LA REPUBLICA of 
Montevideo and EL PAIS of Spain, stressed that Lacalle's decree 
"is unprecedented in the Ibero-American community." 
  In this regard the newspaper directors stressed that 
Ibero-America "does not report a single country in which there 
is a private monopoly on open television and cable television."

<F P=106> [Text of speech by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de </F>
Gortari to the second working session of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit at the Barahona Hall of the Convention 
Center in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 June] 
  [Text] Mr. President of Bolivia, 
  Mr. President of Colombia and host, 
  Your Majesty, 
  Gentlemen heads of state and government, 
  Leaders of international organizations, 
  Ladies and gentlemen: 
  The solidarity of the people of Mexico is with the people of 
Colombia in the region of Cauca and Huila. 
  We are here today, on this generous Colombian soil, to 
continue to strengthen our relations, to progress in our 
commitments, and to project our presence toward Ibero-America, 
and through it to the rest of the world. 
  We have a large task before us. We share the challenge of 
achieving greater economic growth and more justice for our 
people in a more competitive world. 
  It has been said, and with reason, there are no sole 
solutions. This is why the diversity that characterizes us, due 
to the cultural background we share, demands joint efforts in 
areas that are indispensable to expand the domestic progress of 
each of our nations. This is where we find, amid other shared 
concerns, trade and investment, the two topics suggested for 
this meeting. 
  This fourth summit offers us the opportunity to seek 
agreements regarding these issues. I am convinced we must 
continue to promote our current regional agreements and draft 
new treaties that will better coordinate economic policies and 
expand the margins of exchange, investment, and the creation of 
jobs throughout Ibero-America. Many of these agreements 
encourage trade liberation and allow a more efficient 
participation of our countries in international markets. This 
is why we view with optimism the progress made within Latin 
America to form subregional trade zones. 
  Likewise, bilateral commercial agreements on the continent 
and in the Iberian countries are important. These agreements 
allow the whole region to grow closer. 
  Far from being centrifugal forces, these bilateral and 
multilateral agreements can become the foundation for a new 
concept of regional integration. Mexico has promoted commercial 
agreements to the north and south of the continent, in Europe, 
and the Pacific Rim. This is why we welcome the talks among our 
peoples, as we are doing today, to enrich ourselves with all the 
diversity that makes us different and to take advantage of all 
that we share. 
  The most encouraging thing today is the shared certainty 
that 
free and just exchange of capitals, assets, and services is 
helpful for us all. The signing of the agreement that ended the 
GATT Uruguay Round on 15 April opens new doors in international 
economic relations, because it better defines the legal 
framework that regulates international trade, and today, for the 
first time, includes the agricultural sector in commercial 
negotiations. 
  We must make more progress in certain aspects of 
multilateral 
trade, however. It is important that we give greater 
recognition to the efforts being made toward unilateral opening 
and change. It is necessary for us to expand the agreement to 
include services and labor and environmental issues. 
  It is essential to progress by making larger adjustments in 
monetary policies, technological exchange, and shared production 
in order to broaden trade openings and investments. 
Ibero-America must intensify its influence at multilateral 
forums, especially at the new World Trade Organization. 
  Messrs. chiefs of state and government, I also want to 
congratulate and commend President Cesar Gaviria for his new job 
as OAS secretary general. We feel his job is ours. 
  When we began holding Ibero-American summits in 1991, we 
stated their original purpose was to become a regional and 
political forum by acknowledging common historical roots and 
making future tangible proposals. As we have rightfully 
insisted, the Ibero-American community's pivotal point lies in 
the convergence of trade and social, cultural, and educational 
commitments. 
  Our nations' priority is to guarantee the welfare of the 
less 
fortunate. We cannot progress if we have inefficient and 
isolated economies, but we cannot move forward if we have global 
yet socially irresponsible economies. We must insist that 
economic recovery go hand in hand with a deliberate social 
reform and a pluralistic democratic progress. 
  It is necessary to strike a balance to ensure that economic 
growth, social welfare, democratic progress, and an efficient 
entry into the world economy will come about together. This has 
been one of Mexico's deliberate objectives: to embark 
simultaneously on an economic reform to guarantee a great social 
reform and a pluralistic progress, as well as to diversify our 
relations to promote internal transformation efforts. 
  Other Ibero-American nations have progressed with their own 
projects that meet their peoples' needs. Their efforts 
strengthen our common goals. 
  Each effort at integration among our nations should not 
become a pretext to avert the flow of trade or create nontrading 
blocs. We can reach GATT-compatible agreements that will become 
the engines of economic activities, investments, job creation, 
and income distribution, which is what matters the most. With 
this in mind, we will augment our voice in the region, thereby 
linking Ibero-America together, crossing seas, sharing our 
concerns and reaffirming our world presence. 
  The possibility of reinforcing our world efforts lies in our 
resolve to work together. This is why, taking up the 
liberator's ideal, we can certainly say what he did: "I take 
this hope as a revelation." Thank you very much.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro De Leon Carpio today thanked the Ibero-American 
nations for their solidarity during the peace negotiations with 
the guerrillas and urged them to prevent the talks from becoming 
bogged down. 
  During the first session of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit 
of heads of state and government, De Leon Carpio said that 
"there is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel" and that 
despite the difficulty of the negotiations the Guatemalan 
Government is determined to fulfill its moral commitment. 
  "On 29 March we signed a negotiations agreement-schedule, 
which underscores such points as the cease-fire in September and 
the demobilization of the guerrillas in December and which 
confirms that the signing of peace in 1994 is irreversible," De 
Leon Carpio said. 
  The Guatemalan president told the leaders of 21 countries, 
including the Dominican vice president, that he hopes to be 
remembered as the president whose administration established 
"total respect for the law and the conviction that that is the 
best attitude." "We have made considerable progress by signing 
the general agreement on human rights and immediate 
international verification," the president added. 
  The Guatemalan president pointed out that "with the end of 
the 30-year-old internal armed confrontation -- the leading 
source of human rights violations -- we will achieve total 
respect for life and individual guarantees." After urging 
Ibero-America to allow the opening of markets and the 
elimination of protectionist barriers, De Leon Carpio said: "We 
can set the example by trading among ourselves and later 
requesting similar conditions from the rest of the international 
community." 
  According to the Guatemalan president, Central America is 
attempting to reduce its huge social disparities, improve its 
peoples' standard of living through democratic consolidation and 
productive transformations, and increase its participation in 
worldwide trade.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 14 Jun (EFE) -- 
Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres defended the 
"feasible" development promoted by the new Central America 
during a time of peace and democracy, and he asked for access to 
international markets as "the best cooperation possible." 
  Regarding the Haitian crisis, he backed the OAS and UN 
efforts to reestablish democracy in that country. He also 
referred to international commerce and the current trend to 
liberalize it. He said that statements of principles are not 
enough if events continue to show that nations are denied the 
right to participate in this new commercial order because of 
protection measures being implemented. 
  He especially regretted the difficulties of gaining access 
to 
European and United States markets encountered by several 
Central American products. He asked Spain and Portugal to back 
initiatives to resolve those problems "in their position as the 
intermediaries between Europe and America." 
  In his speech at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which is 
being held in the Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, Figueres 
asserted that the democratic system had become stronger in 
Central America, "great improvements" had been made in human 
rights, and the economies had advanced to the opening of 
markets. "We must ensure those advances in the coming years," 
Figueres emphasized. He, however, expressed his concern for the 
social effects caused by policies to improve economic 
indicators. He insisted in benefits of the "Alliance for a 
Feasible Development" program, established by the Central 
American presidents on the basis of respect for their people's 
social needs and the conservation of their natural resources. 
  To attain a feasible development, the governments' efforts 
to 
further the economic sector have to be carried out in 
conjunction with their social investment, he asserted. 
Concurrently, we have to "strengthen our democratic 
institutions" because, he insisted, feasible development 
requires a solid pluralist base as growth "can only be parceled 
in a society that lives and produces in a democracy." 
  Figueres, who assumed the presidency on 8 May and who 
participated in the continental summit for the first time, asked 
for international understanding of the problems confronted by 
Central America after the wars and political instability 
suffered in the region during the past decades. 
  Costa Rica, he said, intends to give priority to its social 
objectives and to "change the market and the state in a creative 
manner." 
  The Costa Rican head of state believes the objective is to 
gain access to the upper levels of international competition, 
but not by offering advantages based on low wages or on the 
excessive exploitation of natural resources.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan 
President Violeta Chamorro today in Cartagena de Indias 
suggested making "economic engines" out of the business sectors 
in the Ibero-American countries gathered at this Caribbean port 
in Colombia. 
  "Contemporary economic integration underscores the new role 
assumed by the private sector, which is actively participating 
in the formulation of economic and social policies," Chamorro 
added. The Nicaraguan president spoke at the first session of 
the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, where 
the heads of state and government of 20 countries have gathered 
for two days to examine trade mechanisms and regional 
development. 
  Private enterprise "should become the engine and strength of 
our economies," Chamorro reiterated. The Nicaraguan president, 
who attended the past three Ibero-American summits held since 
the inception of the regional forum in 1991 in Guadalajara, 
Mexico, said her administration has proven its integrationist 
convictions. 
  The many summits organized by the Central American countries 
have generated a dynamic "that will allow us to resolve the 
problems that for decades have fostered violence in our region," 
Chamorro said. The Nicaraguan president pointed out that 
"Nicaragua has undergone a triple transition process that has 
allowed it to go from war to peace, from a centralized economy 
to a social market economy, and from a clearly totalitarian 
regime to a flourishing democracy." 
  "We have changed ration cards for the exercise of free trade 
through the private sector," added Chamorro, after asserting 
that in this development process "we have buried the rifles." 
The Nicaraguan president admitted that there are inequalities 
in the countries of the region and urged her Ibero-American 
colleagues to strengthen their ties of solidarity and mutual 
support.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina proposed here today to create 
authoritative organizations with economic integration 
decision-making power. He invited other countries to stimulate 
the creation of an Ibero-American Economic Community. Speaking 
during the first session of the Fourth Summit of Ibero-American 
Heads of State and Government, which opened on Tuesday in this 
Colombian port, Reina extended an invitation to endorse "the 
gradual and progressive creation of an Ibero-American Economic 
Community." 
  "The leading role played by commercial enterprises in the 
new 
interdependence schemes should not lead us to think that this 
role ends with the creation of free trade or tariff-free zones," 
he said. Reina pointed out that the Central American countries 
are willing to negotiate commercial agreements jointly with 
third countries and establish a shared economic policy "based on 
sustainable development." 
  According to the Honduran president, the proposed alliance 
between Central America and the United States for sustainable 
development is "the pioneering creative framework" for a 
regional economic integration process. He expressed his desire 
that the multilateral agreement, which was reached during the 
so-called Summit of the Americas, to which the United States 
invited all of the regional countries with the exceptions of 
Cuba and Haiti and which is scheduled to be held in Miami in 
December, be signed. 
  Reina, who is participating in an Ibero-American summit for 
the first time, also asked for the recognition of developmental 
differences among countries that participate in economic 
convergence processes. Regional interdependence "can take place 
only within the context of equality in which all costs and 
profits can be shared equitably ," Reina said. According to 
Reina, development imbalances are compatible with integration 
processes, "provided differences in the countries' 
competitiveness are recognized and taken into consideration at 
the time of the negotiations." 
  Tomorrow, the 22 heads of state and government, in addition 
to Dominican Vice President Carlos Morales Troncoso, will close 
the Ibero-American Summit in this Colombian Caribbean port 
located 1,200 km away from Santa Fe de Bogota.

<F P=106> [Article by special envoy John Gutierrez] </F>
  [Text] The Ibero-American countries' battle against money 
laundering and drug trafficking capitals is targeting new paths. 
On 9 June, Colombia stressed the Ibero-American need to control 
bank accounts and investigate shady transactions and the 
recording of money transfers that exceed reasonable ceilings. 
Colombian experts, who proposed a bill to curtail this scourge, 
believe that the fight against money laundering must extend to 
gambling houses and casinos. The objective is to identify 
players and participants and to keep a numbered record of the 
operations. 
  The ministers and representatives of 20 countries, counseled 
by Spanish experts who have implemented several of the measures 
that are currently being multilaterally discussed, on 9 June 
analyzed the terms of a joint declaration, especially those 
regarding financial system controls. 
  EL TIEMPO posed some questions to the judicial authorities 
of 
a group of countries that are attending the ministers summit, 
which will end on 10 June, and is publishing their opinions and 
proposals on fighting money laundering. In principle, the 
prospects of multilateral money laundering agreements reportedly 
will be fully supported by each nation's legislature. 
<H5>  Mexican Deputy Prosecutor General Ricardo Franco </H5>
  Mexico is currently studying a strategy aimed at locating 
moneys illegally entered or transferred. The objective is to 
zero in on the moneys that come from drug trafficking through 
the cooperation of banks and the operations that authorities 
performed in the bank accounts themselves. 
  Those who commit illegal enrichment will be prosecuted and 
sentenced, on average, to 18 years in prison. The solution to 
this problem lies in reinforcing investigations and broadening 
cooperation among the nations to standardize procedures and 
prosecute criminals. 
  Mexico is acting with the law on its side to conduct a 
head-on fight against drug trafficking and will not hesitate to 
punish those who are involved in any activity related to this 
vice. 
<H5>  Chilean Justice Minister Maria Soledad Alvear </H5>
  Chile is about to approve a bill to drastically penalize 
illicit drug trafficking activities, such as money laundering. 
It is even necessary to study the possibility of lifting bank 
secrecy laws, rendering harsh sentences, and expediting legal 
procedures in those cases where there irregular money 
transactions are detected. 
  In our country, we have reached a consensus on moving 
forward 
with drug legislation, although there are certain sectors that 
oppose bank secrecy violations. 
<H5>  Argentine Justice Minister Jorge Luis Maiorano </H5>
  Argentina is equipped with the necessary juridical 
instruments to combat money laundering through actions 
coordinated with the banking system in order to detect, for 
instance, irregular bank account transfers by businesses or 
individuals. 
  In addition, all government bodies have the political 
resolve 
to avoid the proliferation of this affliction. A cooperation 
effort should be implemented in Ibero-America. There is also 
modern legislation on the subject, legislation that carries 
prison terms of up to eight years minimum, forbids prison 
releases, and empowers judges and the Justice Ministry to 
intervene as irregular transactions are detected and confirmed. 
<H5>  Bolivian Justice Minister Rene Blatman </H5>
  In Bolivia, we are holding a number of seminars with banks 
and are drafting a bill to fight money laundering. Our belief 
is that it must be a joint effort among the international 
community. Isolated efforts are destined to fail. 
  Two viable mechanisms, which should be adopted by the 
region, 
to curtail this illegal activity are the lifting of bank secrecy 
laws on suspicious accounts and the creation of formulas to 
justify money sources. 
<H5>  Spanish Justice Minister Teresa Fernandez </H5>
  Spain has adopted criminal and administrative measures to 
prevent capital flight and money laundering, such as setting 
ceilings on cash payments, exerting larger loan controls, and 
storing operations records for up to five years. In addition, 
the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office was created and is 
authorized to request information from banks. 
  Money laundering is one of the practices that has provided 
oxygen tanks to drug traffickers. This is why I believe 
Ibero-America must adopt measures of this nature to halt money 
laundering. 
<H5>  Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat Florez </H5>
  We have not faced the situation generated by drug 
traffickers' investments, because we had a closed economy in 
Cuba. Since we opened our economy, we have been receiving 
foreign aid through agreements with the Cuban Government. 
However, we have been careful and are thoroughly investigating 
and scrutinizing the sources of capital.

<F P=106> [Interview with President Fidel Castro by unidentified CNN </F>
reporter in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 15 June -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Reporter] What do you expect from this summit? 
  [Castro] Every summit has had a positive effect, has 
fostered 
a closeness and friendship among the peoples of Latin America. 
Diverse initiatives have sprung from the summits. This summit is 
already an institution and constitutes a Latin American force. 
This is something new which did not exist before. Previously, 
the Latin American peoples meet only when summoned by the United 
States. This is the fourth time we have met by our own 
initiative. 
  [Reporter] Do you expect this summit to be akin to a 
platform 
to allow Cuba to rejoin the OAS? 
  [Castro] I do not hope for that much. This is a complex 
problem. Diverse opinions have been expressed. We have to wait 
to see the final result in favor of Cuba's reincorporation in 
the OAS. That does not necessarily guarantee, however, that the 
good wishes of many Latin American peoples can be effected. 
  [Reporter] What is your answer to the call by all the Latin 
American leaders advocating a political and democratic opening 
in Cuba? 
  [Castro] No, not all. Some very respectfully expressed their 
views. I appreciate their concern for Cuba but I in turn 
replied, you heard it, that I could not believe that not a 
single word had been said against such an unfair and inhuman 
blockade which is trying to make our people surrender out of 
hunger and turn our country into a blood bath, and which 
attempts to dismiss the heroic resistance which Cuba and the 
Cuban people have put up in defense of dignity and sovereignty 
of the peoples of Latin America for more than 35 years. Our 
views are ignored. 
  Our country has been institutionalized and we have our views 
on how the country ought to be organized, how to keep the 
country united. We have our Constitution and follow it. I 
believe our practices and the participation of our people are 
truly much more democratic than that of others systems. There is 
more than one model of democracy. I also explained how 
distraught we were by the fact that it has not been acknowledged 
that Cuba has attained the greatest social progress in the 
history of this hemisphere; and that this hemisphere has the 
worst distribution of wealth and land, that millions of people 
die every year, people who could be saved. We have done so in 
Cuba. Only in Cuba, the Revolution's social efforts have not 
only educated the entire population but also saved the lives of 
hundreds of thousands of people. [Words indistinct] the others 
have not done this. 
  [Reporter] As you explained, Cuba has experienced great 
social development. Currently, great economic development is 
taking place. 
  [Castro] No, great economic development is not taking place 
right now. We are under a double blockade. We have endured the 
U.S. blockade for over 30 years and we have had to abide the 
outcome of the collapse of the socialist bloc, with which we had 
the bulk of our trade, and the disappearance of the Soviet Union. 
  [Reporter] Is Cuba attracting foreign investment? 
  [Castro] It is, not in the proportion we would like, but 
increasingly so. 
  [Reporter] Could we expect to see an opening in Cuba like in 
the PRC where a market economy coexists with a socialist 
government? 
  [Castro] We have studied the Chinese and Vietnamese 
experiences and everything useful and applicable to Cuba that we 
can take from that experience will be undoubtedly implemented. 
We cannot mechanically copy everything they have done because 
their situation is different. For example, in the PRC, 80 
percent of the population lives in rural areas where in Cuba, 80 
percent of the population lives in urban areas. We cannot do in 
rural areas some of the things they do. We have to do things 
differently. We are in close contact with the PRC and Vietnam 
and have studied them seriously in addition to our own 
contributions. We have also conducted a significant economic 
opening and are aware that we have to solve problems under very 
difficult conditions. It was easier to resist the blockade when 
the USSR existed and we had guaranteed trade and markets, fair 
prices for our products, and had credit and technology which 
today we do not have. Nowadays, we have to accomplish this on 
our own and under enormous U.S. pressures. 
  [Reporter] You have made a unique statement by wearing a 
guayabera for the first time in over 35 years. Does this imply a 
change? 
  [Castro] Well, rather than a change it is matter of 
(?deference) and respect, first of all, to the local climate and 
second, to the request of the organizers. They sent word to 
please come in guayaberas or shirts. I did not have any 
guayaberas or shirts, our suits. I had to rush. Someone lent me 
a guayabera for measurements, then one was made for me at full 
speed. I had no idea how it was going to fit. On Monday, the 
very day I left, guayaberas were being made for me. Thus, I 
complied with all the requirements of the climate and the host 
and I am very comfortable. 
  [Reporter] Will there be Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long 
time? 
  [Castro] Who can tell if there will be Fidel Castro in Cuba 
for a long time? It all depends on my health and, above all, my 
capacity to contribute to solve the national problems. 
  There is no need for Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long time. 
We 
have many outstanding comrades able to do the job. We have been 
developing younger and well prepared cadres. I am not 
indispensable. I do not believe myself indispensable, nor does 
it worry me how much longer I may have, how long I am going to 
last, or for how long will they demand that I fulfill certain 
duties which, by the way, are not easy. 
  [Reporter] Do you not think it is time for the Cuban people 
to have other political options? 
  [Castro] The Cuban people participated in elections not long 
ago. 
  [Reporter] But it is a one party system. 
  [Castro] Yes, but the party does not nominate the 
candidates. 
The candidates are nominated directly by the people. In other 
words, we do not have one but a thousand, every citizen has the 
option to make a nomination. The neighbors in the district meet 
and nominate candidates. 
  [Reporter] But these are candidates from the Communist Party 
of Cuba [PCC]? 
  [Castro] Well, it is an honor. There are many who are not 
members of the PCC, however. Yet, in Cuba, the candidates are 
nominated by the people, not the PCC. The PCC does not 
participate in the nomination of candidates, the mass 
organizations do. The percentage of the population that votes is 
much higher than in the United States, a higher percentage than 
in any Latin American country. That is a fact. 
  [Reporter] Regarding the embargo: Canada has said that it 
supports the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Do you believe 
this is a good beginning to which the U.S. will be receptive? 
  [Castro] Canada has always followed independent and 
outstanding policies regarding ties with Cuba, a policy of 
respect for our national sovereignty. This policy, like 
Mexico's, has been upheld for over 30 years through various 
administrations, conservative, liberal, and progressive.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuban 
President Fidel Castro said here today that people who enter 
embassies in Cuba violently lose their right to obtain a visa to 
leave the country. "Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can obtain a 
departure visa but anyone who enters an embassy violently loses 
that right," Castro said in a statement for the Colombian 
station Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN). 
  Castro said Cubans who are of age can request visas to leave 
the country, but they cannot always obtain visas from the 
corresponding embassies and therefore decide to occupy the 
installations. 
  On Wednesday, nine persons forcefully entered the Chilean 
Consulate in Havana while 20 others are currently at the German 
Embassy and 118 at the Belgian ambassador's residence demanding 
authorization to leave the island. Castro said the Cuban 
government has the obligation of protecting the embassies. He 
added, however, that force should not be used. 
  Yesterday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National 
Assembly of the People's Government, noted the need to "prevent 
in a civilized manner" the violation and vulnerability of 
diplomatic missions. He stressed that Cuban authorities will 
refrain from dislodging the several civilians who occupied the 
embassies by force, adding that no reprisals will be taken 
against them if they change their attitude. "It is necessary to 
prevent in a civilized manner" the forceful occupation of 
embassies "if we do not want the law of the jungle to prevail or 
even prevent the disappearance of diplomatic service," Alarcon 
stressed. 
  He said that so far the countries affected by those 
incidents 
have cooperated with Cuban authorities in trying to persuade the 
occupants to voluntarily and peacefully leave the installations. 
Alarcon, a former foreign minister, said the occupation of 
embassies is the result of U.S. immigration policy, which denies 
visas to Cubans who want to emigrate to that country. 
  In his statement to RCN -- one of the most important radio 
networks in Colombia -- Castro also referred to Cuba's relations 
with the United States, denying the possibility for "direct 
contact" at this time. He stressed that U.S. President William 
Clinton is very interested in obtaining his reelection and 
therefore power groups, which he did not identify, are 
pressuring him to maintain the sanctions against Cuba. 
  Castro said he is pleased with the election of Colombian 
President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, but ruled out 
the possibility that he can promote Cuba's return to the 
regional organization in the very near future. For Cuba, its 
return to the OAS is not a priority; what we view as a priority 
is the end of the economic blockade the United States has 
maintained against the island for more than 30 years, Castro 
stressed. Castro described the blockade as "inhuman and 
criminal." He added that it is not justified because the Cold 
War is over and said it has hurt Cuba more due to changes in its 
trade activities, 80 percent of which were carried out with the 
socialist bloc. 
  Consulted about the situation in Colombia -- a country 
facing 
guerrilla groups comprised of several million armed men -- 
Castro denied his country interferes in the internal affairs of 
other countries. He recognized that for some time, Cuba 
actively supported revolutionary movements in Latin America 
because they supported the [Cuban] policy toward the United 
States, but he explained that that situation has changed. He 
said his country's relations with Latin America are based on 
mutual respect and nonintervention in the internal affairs of 
each nation. 
  Castro refused to comment on the possible results of 
Sunday's 
presidential elections in Colombia. He only said he hopes the 
elected president will continue working to further improve the 
electoral process. 
  Castro recognized that he does not have the same energy as 
when he was 20 or 30 years old. He added that he will retire 
when the right time comes, after overcoming the current 
difficult moments because he does not want to look like a 
deserter. He said he would like to have "a small piece" of land 
in Cuba to rest and dedicate his time to reading. He noted, 
however, that he still works 15, 16, or 17 hours daily.

<F P=106> ["Our Opinion" commentary by Orlando Contreras for the </F>
"Doing Radio" newscast] 
  [Text] The Fourth Ibero-American Summit has just concluded 
in Cartagena de Indias, a city that is part of the cultural and 
historical patrimony of the world. The final document is 19 
pages long and, obviously, we have not had access to it. 
Judging from substantive elements contained in the final 
document, we consider that the balance of this fourth summit is 
positive. It is not all that we expected and -- this is a 
personal opinion -- it is not what Latin America, the Caribbean, 
and the Iberian world could expect under the circumstances that 
currently prevail in the world; but it is evidently a step 
forward in the efforts for integration and joint efforts among 
countries of Iberian origin. 
  I believe, and it is quite obvious, that the decision 
adopted 
by the heads of state and government who participated in the 
summit concerning the blockade against Cuba is a positive step 
forward when compared with previous summits. Regarding this, I 
would like to comment on what was approved yesterday at 
Cartagena de Indias. The presidents and heads of state decided 
to support the elimination, according to international law 
principles and the UN resolution, of economic and commercial 
measures which affect free development of international commerce 
and impair living conditions in Ibero-American nations. 
  Obviously, the paragraph does not textually mention the 
United States as the factor, the agent who has imposed a 
blockade which has lasted for 32 years against our country. 
Neither does it mention Cuba as the victim of this criminal and 
unfair blockade, as Fidel termed it at the fourth summit. If we 
analyze previous agreements however, we will see that in 
Salvador de Bahia they took note, they only took note of the 
decisions adopted in other international forums. To be more 
precise, I would rather read what was agreed upon at the third 
summit; and you will be able to compare the text of the 
agreement adopted at the previous summit in Salvador de Bahia 
and the one adopted in Cartagena de Indias. 
  Paragraph 68 of the resolution adopted at Salvador de Bahia, 
Brazil, states: We take note of recent resolutions adopted at 
international forums on the need to eliminate the unilateral 
implementation, by any state and for political purposes, of 
economic and commercial measures against any other state. The 
paragraph begins with a note-taking action rather than an 
opinion, censure, or explicit support for an accord's 
elimination. This time, the heads of state and government who 
met in Cartagena de Indias endorsed the elimination, based on 
international law principles, of accords which harm or are 
detrimental for Ibero-American nations. This is a clear 
allusion to the criminal and unfair blockade imposed by the 
United States against our country. 
  There are other substantive elements. For example, in a 
world marked by neoliberalism, the document states the decision 
to bolster cooperation and mutual aid in the Ibero-American 
community, and a special emphasis was made on the need to look 
after the poorest sectors of the Latin American population. 
This decision in a world marked by neoliberalism, I repeat, 
represents an assumption that this neoliberalism is incapable of 
providing real solutions to the critical problems which afflict 
the Latin American world, the world of Iberian origin. 
  Moreover, to conclude, I would like to state that within 
this 
effort for unity, cooperation, and collaboration, it is positive 
that Latin America supported President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari's candidacy to the World Trade Organization. As you 
well know, this organization replaces the GATT. Only the 
Iberian countries in Europe, meaning Spain and Portugal, did not 
support the resolution because they had already pledged to 
support Italy's Renato Ruggiero. In other words, a 
differentiation was made between 19 Latin American countries and 
the European countries. 
  In essence, this represents a step forward, a positive step. 
It is not what we expected but Ibero-American consultation has 
been consolidated. Actually, it has been institutionalized, a 
meeting of the coordination group will be held in Santa Fe de 
Bogota. In fact, a timetable has been announced for the 
agreement adopted in Madrid: Argentina next year; Chile in 
1995, El Salvador in 1997, Portugal in 1998, Cuba in 1999, 
Panama in 2000, and Peru in 2001. I know of no precedent in 
which countries that will host the summit have been later 
rejected.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon from the "Evening Information </F>
Review"] 
  [Text] In Cartagena de Indias, Cuban President Fidel Castro 
has said the United States should change its immigration policy 
regarding Latin America and the Caribbean. Addressing the 
plenum at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the Cuban president 
broached a sensitive point when he called on the United States 
to enact a law that would automatically legalize the status of 
Latin American and Caribbean peoples who have entered the 
northern country, as it is doing with Cuban citizens today. 
  The double standard in the U.S. policy regarding immigrants 
of the hemisphere can be seen most notably in the last three and 
a half decades, as Washington has given special treatment to 
Cubans who reach that country while it has repressed the 
citizens of other nationalities. 
  As a result of the Cuban Readjustment Act, enacted in the 
United States in 1966, any Cuban, regardless of motive or means 
of transportation, may be granted political refugee status 
merely by reaching U.S. territory and remaining there for a 
year. The laws favoring Cuban immigration and the slowness in 
granting permanent residence through legal means have encouraged 
illegal departures from Cuban territory. The exceptional, 
privileged treatment the United States grants to Cuban 
immigration is contingent upon a political premise that is not 
given to citizens of other regional countries. 
  There are instances in which fragile boats full of Cubans 
and 
Haitians have reached the coast of the Florida peninsula: Cubans 
searching for better economic opportunities and Haitians 
escaping military repression. The U.S. authorities returned the 
Haitians, but the Cubans received every possible assistance and 
were quickly able to legalize their status and subsequently 
turned over to their relatives. 
  More than 7 million immigrants entered the United States 
between 1981 to 1990, according to official figures, but Cuba 
ranks 16th among the countries that contribute the most 
immigrants. There is no other reason, other than political, to 
treat Cubans with privilege to the detriment of the remaining 
Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, especially Mexicans. 
  No wonder the Cuban president just stated the following in 
Cartagena de Indias: At a time when the Berlin Wall no longer 
exists, the wall being built at the Mexican-U.S. border should 
be torn down.

  [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (DPA) -- Cuba is determined to 
continue with its nuclear plans even though the construction of 
its most important project, the Juragua Electronuclear Plant, 
temporarily suspended in 1992, has yet to resume. In response to 
a question asked by a DPA reporter, an Executive Secretariat for 
Nuclear Affairs (SEAN) source said the country's plan was 
drafted with multifaceted goals. 
  In 1983, Cuba began building two 440-megawatt nuclear energy 
reactors in the area of Cienfuegos, on the south-central coast 
of the island approximately 300 km east of Havana. On 5 
September 1992, when President Fidel Castro announced the halt 
of "the construction of the century," one of the reactors was 90 
percent completed and scheduled to begin operating in late 1995 
or early 1996, while the other one was only 20 or 30 percent 
completed. 
  The project, which is estimated to have involved an 
investment of $1.1 billion, would have been a big relief for 
Cuban authorities, who lack hard money to buy the necessary oil 
for the operational use of their thermoelectric plants. 
  For his part, Dr. Daniel Cordoniu, executive deputy 
secretary 
of the SEAN, said that, together with nuclear energy (production 
of electricity stemming from the fusion of the atom) [passage as 
received], another method being developed is the use of 
radioisotopes and radiation in diverse fields. In addition to 
being used in biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and 
health, which are priority areas in the country, these nuclear 
techniques are being applied both in the food program and in 
open support of diverse industries, the researcher said recently 
on Cubavision's "Open Agenda" program. In that sense, he also 
mentioned other areas, such as nickel-bearing, sugar, and oil 
industries, without ruling out the use of nuclear techniques in 
environmental activities related to tourism. 
  Engineer Gilberto Salazar, who is also executive vice 
secretary of the SEAN, praised the production of 
radiopharmaceuticals (components that are introduced into the 
body for diagnostic and therapeutical purposes), which have 
permitted substituting imports in 1993. He explained that this 
progress was achieved by the Center of Applied Studies to 
Nuclear Development (CEADEN), which is also taking part in 
preparing certain components. 
  That technique is virtually irreplaceable in the studies of 
absorption, distribution, metabolism, and the excretion of 
medicine (pharmacodynamics), which is essential for registering 
new medicines, Salazar stated. After noting that the 
preservation of the Juragua plant has been achieved 
satisfactorily with the Basic Industries Ministry as investor, 
Codorniu confirmed that alternatives are being sought to 
complete the project. Cuba and Russia are willing to contribute 
foreign capital to put the Juragua plant in operation, which 
will net the island a savings of over 800,000 tons of oil 
annually. 
  Diplomatic sources in Havana and Moscow agreed that there is 
great interest in this regard and that French authorities 
apparently are considering possibly financing the project 
jointly with Russia. The weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL, which is 
edited in Spanish, English, and French, recently revealed that 
the Russian Government granted the island a $30 million loan to 
maintain the project. The necessary funding to obtain an 
automation system for the plant's only reactor, however, is 
pending.

  [Text] Since January, the Central Region Oil Drilling and 
Extraction enterprise has delivered more than 385,000 tons of 
oil, thus surpassing its projected goals by 3 percent. The 
enterprise director, Engineer Marcos Aguilera, told national 
reporters that the workers' efforts were paired with positive 
results from foreign companies in charge of exploiting several 
wells and the regular arrival of tankers. 
  Engineer Aguilera added that the current situation allows us 
to believe that this overage can be maintained or surpasssed by 
the end of the first semester, at which time they expect to have 
extracted 410,870 tons.

figures as heard] 
  [Text] The Fernando Echenique Rice Enterprise in Granma 
must produce almost 50 percent of the country's rice consumption 
this year, meaning 100,000 tons. The country spent $17 million 
this year in fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, lubricants, and 
tires. All the material is already at the Cuban rice 
enterprises' warehouses. 
  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan said the effort exerted 
in the nation's economic sector must be complemented with more 
technological discipline, efficiency, and quality in the 
harvest's organization. The minister also emphasized: 
  [Begin Jordan recording] We must (?optimize) the efficiency 
in the country's rice production again because it is clear we 
cannot produce with 5,100 caballerias the same volume we 
produced with 10,000 caballerias. We can, however, certainly 
achieve the highest efficiency in history with 5,100 
caballerias; and I believe this dignifies the rice producers. 
We must work in that direction. [end recording] 
  Cuba consumes 500,000 tons of rice in a year. To get the 
amount we do not produce -- 400,000 tons -- the economy has 
alloted $110 million to purchase it abroad. The rice harvest has 
officially started in Granma Province.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican President 
Joaquin Balaguer today criticized a request issued by the U.S. 
State Department to hold elections in those areas of the country 
in which irregularities were detected during the 19 May voting 
process. 
  Although Balaguer acknowledged the existence of anomalies 
during the elections, he stressed that it will be up to the 
Central Electoral Board (JCE) to decide the issue. He stated 
that no authority, whether domestic or foreign, is entitled to 
interfere with the JCE's announcement of election results, as 
the U.S. State Department did this past Wednesday. 
  Balaguer's statements drew an immediate response from the 
U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo, which reiterated the U.S. 
commitment to democracy in America. 
  Despite his criticism of the request, Balaguer agreed to 
stage complementary elections in those communities in which 
voters were excluded from voting lists. The United States 
praised Balaguer's decision to repeat the elections, leaving the 
final decision to the JCE, adding that "such a decision will 
pave the way toward resolving the controversial results." 
  Balaguer explained he supports some of the recommendations 
made by the United States, but he added that he opposes any 
domestic or foreign interference in the JCE's decisions. He 
also reiterated that the JCE is the organization that will 
decide which measures will be adopted to resolve the issue. 
  On Wednesday, State Department spokesman Michael McCurry 
released a document sent to the Dominican Government which 
called for an investigation and clarification into charges of 
irregularities reported by international observers. The 
document notes: "The United States strongly urges the release of 
the actual documents that were used at the voting tables on 
Election Day." 
  The balloting is being protested by the Dominican 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), which contends that at least 200,000 
voters were excluded, mainly supporters of this party's 
presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez. 
  Balaguer stated that the past elections were the cleanest 
and 
most transparent ever staged in the Dominican Republic, as well 
as in Latin America. Nevertheless, he acknowledged that 
following the elections, the Dominican economy has been 
paralyzed by the JCE's delay in announcing the winner, although 
he pointed out that the economy will recover once the election 
process has concluded. 
  Balaguer also blamed the opposition for the electoral 
tribunal's delay in announcing the winner because the number of 
challenges that have been filed, particularly by the PRD, are 
preventing the JCE from proclaiming a winner without first 
concluding investigations into the charges.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Dominican President 
Joaquin Balaguer today expressed his opposition to a military 
intervention in Haiti to oust the military government that 
overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. 
Nevertheless, he warned that the Dominican Government is 
prepared to protect the joint border. 
  Balaguer said he is confident that due to the Latin American 
government's rejection of an invasion, the international 
community will not reach the extreme of invading Haiti. 
  He said dialogue between the two sides in conflict in Haiti 
could contribute to the return of democracy in that country and 
he explained that Dominican authorities are ready to defend and 
protect the 386-km border shared with Haiti on the island of 
Hispaniola, in case of a military invasion. 
  Balaguer has repeatedly opposed the embargo imposed on Haiti 
by the international community. Nevertheless, since the end of 
May there has been strict compliance with the sanctions, to the 
point of preventing Haitians from obtaining food and medicine in 
the Dominican Republic. The Dominican president has ordered 
approximately 15,000 soldiers to guard the border with Haiti to 
prevent the violation of the international embargo against that 
country. Border surveillance intensified after Balaguer held 
several meetings with UN and U.S. officials in Santo Domingo. 
The heavy border surveillance, which prevents Haitians and 
Dominicans from trading on the border, has caused at least three 
Haitian deaths in the past 15 days during attacks on Dominican 
soldiers who prevent Haitians from crossing the border.

  [Text] Provisional President Emile Jonassaint has again 
denounced the international community's misunderstanding of 
Haiti. In a message to foreign journalists living in Haiti, 
Jonassaint said he hopes to provide, through these colleagues of 
the press, all the information that defines the Haitian reality, 
without distortion. 
  The international community wants to impose a policy and 
politicians that the Haitian people have rejected. In this 
message, Jonassaint [word indistinct] to open the door, sees 
that the international community wants to open the door to civil 
war in Haiti just so it can be right. 
  The message asks: Do they want to offer to individuals 
living 
abroad the opportunity and satisfaction of having their 
countries [as heard] occupied by foreign powers? Do they want to 
offer them the satisfaction of destabilizing their country [as 
heard] and realizing an explosion of Haitian civilian society? 
Those who represent them [not further identified] even dared 
call the people to civil disobedience; therefore, anarchy; 
trying, ipso facto, to destroy, the authority and very 
government of Haiti. They want to impose on us an adventure of 
[words indistinct], which is not suitable either to our culture 
or our desiderate, much less our history. These Haitians who are 
disparaged, reviled, and excluded from the international 
community, are quietly moving toward elections, the only 
honorable way out of the abominable crisis we are experiencing 
at this time. 
  Jonassaint speaks of the main priorities defined by his 
government. Those priorities have already formed the subject of 
an official document. The text will soon be communicated to the 
media, he announced.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Emile Jonassaint, 
provisional president of Haiti, today said that presidential and 
legislative elections would provide the only way out of the 
crisis that has existed in the country since September 1991, 
when constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed. 
  In a message released to foreign reporters in Haiti, 
Jonassaint, who was placed in his post by the military in May, 
added that the international community is seeking to launch "an 
adventure in Haiti similar to the one launched by Pol Pot in 
Cambodia." 
  In this way, the Haitian leader was referring to the embargo 
decreed by the United Nations, which is designed to force the 
Haitian military to leave power and fulfill the agreements 
signed with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was overthrown by a 
group of military leaders headed by General Raoul Cedras, chief 
of the Armed Forces. In his message to foreign reporters, the 
de facto president did not mention Aristide. 
  On Wednesday, the Haitian Army staged parades in 
Port-au-Prince and in the provinces in support of Gen. Cedras. 
The parades were staged at a time when, according to sources 
close to the Haitian military, differences are beginning to 
emerge within the Army command. 
  On Tuesday, differences were noted following statements by 
Evans Francois, who requested Gen. Cedras' resignation. Evans 
Francois is the brother and adviser of Police Chief Joseph 
Michel Francois. Evans Francois accused Cedras of being 
responsible for the crisis that exists in Haiti and of heading a 
"triumvirate" under the guise of Emile Jonassaint, a judge 
supported by the military to hold the post of chief of state and 
government. 
  Although the Haitian police chief has denied any connection 
to his brother's remarks, telling the public and the Army that 
he does not support his brother's views, sources close to the 
military told EFE: "There are a number of large differences." 
The sources added: "There is a group demanding a way out, 
arguing that the status quo cannot continue much longer and 
demanding an honorable way out for the Army."

  [Text] It should be noted that on 15 June, Washington 
asserted that a breach was observed within the Haitian military 
institution which, according to the U.S. State Department, is a 
consequence of the new sanctions against Haiti. In 
Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haitian, and Jeremie, the opposite is being 
demonstrated, with military parades and marches expressing 
support for General Cedras and against a possible intervention 
in Haiti. 
  On 15 June, Haitian Army battalions marched in 
Port-au-Prince 
and in other cities, including Jeremie and Cap-Haitian, with 
fanfare and flags. The military are reportedly parading as a 
show of support for the Army commander in chief. Civilians 
accompanying the Army took the opportunity to chant 
anti-Aristide slogans on 15 June in Port-au-Prince. 
  In Cap-Haitian, the military also marched through the city's 
streets before placing a spray of flowers at the foot of the 
statue honoring the heroes of Haitian independence. Our 
correspondent, Joseph Claude Larouse, in Cap-Haitian filed a 
report: 
  [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] In Cap-Haitian, 
several hundred military soldiers from the Haitian Armed Forces 
paraded this morning through the streets of the city. They 
marched to Vertieres, where they placed a spray of flowers at 
the monument to the heroes of the War of Independence. The 
military advised that this gesture was to ask the heroes for the 
strength and courage to resist to the end the difficult 
situation the country is facing, especially the threat of 
intervention. Colonel Josaphat stated, however, that it was just 
the usual parade. This parade nonetheless was held after U.S. 
officials made statements such as -- and I quote: We do not 
exclude any possibilities, including armed military 
intervention, to resolve the crisis in Haiti. Unquote. 
  Several grassroots organizations condemned those statements, 
including the National Cooperative Action Movement and the 
Committee for Patriotic Action and Citizens' Defense, rejecting 
all plans for intervention in Haiti and asking that the 
sanctions against the country be immediately lifted. 
  On the other hand, groups supporting President Aristide ask 
that Gen. Raoul Cedras and Colonel Michel Francois resign from 
the Army. They also ask for the immediate return of President 
Aristide to stop the suffering of the people. Meanwhile, since 
the new sanctions went into effect in the country, activities 
have slowed to 80 percent in the Cap-Haitian harbor and airport. 
For instance, flights between Cap-Haitian and Miami have been 
reduced to one. The situation is almost the same in the harbor.

  [Text] Deputy Antoine Joseph recommends intra-Haitian 
negotiations to avoid a military intervention against Haiti. The 
lawmaker believes the Chamber of Deputies could play an 
important role in these negotiations. To the former president of 
the Chamber of Deputies, it is necessary to preserve national 
sovereignty in exploring dialogue. 
  [Begin Joseph recording] Any self-respecting Haitian must 
say 
no to intervention. I do not believe that preparing for 
war is the solution. What matters now is how to avoid the 
intervention with a minimum of breakdowns with regard to the 
actors concerned in the crisis. I admit that the Security 
Council resolution complicated the situation because it goes 
beyond the Governors Island accord. The accord had asked for the 
resignation of General Cedras, while the resolution asks for the 
resignation of the police chief and the Army staff as well. 
  Therefore, I believe it is more than time to begin 
intra-Haitian negotiations. If we consider all that is happening 
right now -- with Jonassaint, a government that is not well 
installed, no prime minister -- I believe the Chamber of 
Deputies now constitutes a reserve or reference that can begin 
intra-Haitian negotiations, negotiations with Gen. Cedras and 
the Army members to see how we can study the Security Council 
resolution and later extend those negotiations to the 
international level in an effort to find a solution before 25 
June. 
  I think it is possible. Personally, as a lawmaker and a 
former president of the lower chamber, and having a certain 
knowledge of the political matters of this country, I am ready 
to participate in all negotiations aimed at avoiding an 
intervention in the country, but mostly to put an end to this 
everlasting crisis. [end recording]

  [Excerpts] The FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion 
and Progress of Haiti] is on the way to becoming the Armed 
Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People. The high 
administrative staff of the FRAPH has decided to change strategy 
as of next 21 June. During a press briefing held on 15 June, 
Emmanuel Constant declared that the resistance to any U.S. 
military intervention in Haiti has begun. Let us listen to the 
report of Luckenson Jean: 
  [Begin recording] [Constant] "All of us are ready, are we 
not, to die with our weapons in our hands. FRAPH, where are 
you? [crowd shouts: "Here we are!"] FRAPH, where are you? [crowd 
shouts: "Here we are!"] FRAPH, where are you? [crowd shouts: 
"Here we are!"] Divisions? [crowd shouts: "No!"] Divisions? 
[crowd shouts: "No!"] Solidarity? [crowd shouts: "Yes!"]" 
  [Jean] "On next 21 June, FRAPH will stand for the Armed 
Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People. As of the afternoon 
of 15 June, FRAPH declared that the national resistance against 
the enemy has begun. The FRAPH leader asked all foreigners 
living in the country not to leave the national territory as a 
sign of solidarity with the Haitian people, to not to follow the 
evacuation communique issued by the U.S. Embassy. These 
statements were made by Toto Constant in his home at about 1500." 
  [Constant] Today, we, together, solemnly declare that the 
Haitian resistance has begun. First, it will be passive 
resistance. Then, if that does not work and the international 
community and President Clinton do not hear our cry of alarm, we 
will begin active resistance. We invite the national and 
international press to a news conference that will be held on 
Tuesday, 21 June at 1400, not by the FRAPH, but by the Armed 
Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People. 
  [Jean] "Constant criticized U.S. President Clinton, UN 
Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, and Mr. Gray, the new 
person in charge of the Haitian file. He asked them to review 
their decisions so Haiti does not turn into Somalia. Several 
children, several small Haitian children, have already died as a 
result of the negative effects of the embargo. FRAPH 
congratulated the commander in chief of the Army and the police 
chief; it asked them to remain steadfast, and supported the 
communique on the state of emergency of the third provisional 
government not acknowledged by the international community and 
which most parliamentarians term an abuse of authority. 
  ``According to the FRAPH leader, the foreign intervention 
which hangs over the country like the sword of Damocles is 
unfair and criminal. Constant thinks the intervention is aimed 
at assassinating FRAPH members and the civilian population.'' 
  [Constant] [passage omitted] We in FRAPH fully support the 
Haitian Armed Forces, the Port-au-Prince police, and provisional 
President Emile Jonassaint within the scope of providing 
security for the foreign and national population. 
  [Jean] [passage omitted] They and all political parties are 
ready to order a state of siege throughout the national 
territory. Constant asked the Haitian people to defend the 
achievements of 1946, 1957, 1991, and even 1994 without 
violence. FRAPH finds itself compelled to secure its members 
and they will be armed with traditional weapons such as pikes, 
potions, and so on. [passage omitted] 
  [Constant] We need a government [pauses] we need a return to 
constitutional order of the center-right nature, but not a 
populist return to constitutional order. If Mr. Gray continues 
to destroy diplomacy, as far as we are concerned, we have 
decided to die innocently and unfairly. [passage omitted] 
  [Jean] "The Bible says a house divided against itself shall 
fall. Constant says he has no disagreement with Chamblain and 
there is no division within FRAPH, contrary to what they are 
saying. Concerning the other parallel parties, such as the 
Assembly of Democrats for the Republic, the Volunteers for 
National Security, and the Capois Lamort Organization [OCL], 
Constant said they are all members of the great 30 September 
[1991] family who have different views on the situation. 
  ``Toto Constant, who was wearing a gray suit and who held a 
one and one half year-old girl, who was wearing a white dress, 
stated that the child represented the innocence of the Haitian 
people. We should tell you there was much suspense among the 
audience made up of FRAPH members coming from various areas in 
the capital. The conference was not held in the living room, 
like what is usually done, but in the yard under a custard apple 
tree. Chamblain and the leader of the OCL were not present at 
this conference. Luckenson Jean for Signal FM." [end recording] 
  It should be noted that the provisional government pointed 
out last month that only the Army and the police are recognized 
as armed forces by the Haitian Constitution.

  [Text] The first group of Haitians to be processed off the 
coast of Jamaica arrived in Jamaican waters this morning. The 
Haitian boat people were picked up at sea by a U.S. Coast Guard 
vessel. It is expected that these Haitians will be taken on 
board the processing vessel the Comfort off the coast of Port 
Royal soon. The opposition Jamaica Labor Party [JLP] yesterday 
asked a number of questions about the memorandum of 
understanding between the Government of Jamaica and the United 
States Government establishing a facility to process Haitian 
refugees within the Jamaican territorial waters. JLP chairman 
(Booth Golding) asked whether Haitian nationals found at sea 
outside of the United States waters will be protected by the 
U.S. authorities after ascertaining whether they are in Haitian 
refugee status. He also asked what international law or 
convention governs the [words indistinct]. 
  In a message to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
Dr. 
Paul Robertson, Mr. (Golding) raises 13 qusetions on the 
memorandum of understanding. He asks what is the legal basis for 
the compulsory repatriation of Haitian nationals by United 
States authorities when the port of exit Jamaica. The JLP 
chairman also asked what role the Jamaican authorities have in 
the event of death or injury to any Haitian on board a 
processing facility. On the question of funding, Mr. (Golding) 
asked what recourse is available to the Jamaican Government in 
the event that the United States Government is not able to 
reimburse the Jamaican Government for the directly attributable 
costs incurred in this operation. 
  Yesterday Brigadier General of the U.S. [word indistinct] 
Mike Williams told the Jamaican media that adequate systems were 
in place for the disposal of food and other wastes. He said both 
the Comfort and the [name indistinct], the Ukranian vessel which 
will support the U.S. Naval ship, (?conform with) international 
and environmental regulations. He also allayed the fears of 
those concerned that the docking of the naval ship was the 
beginning of a plan for an invasion of Haiti. The [name 
indistinct] also docked yesterday [words indistinct] one mile 
off Lime Cay.

  [Text] The International Seabed Authority is now located in 
Jamaica. The Authority is expected to hold its first meeting in 
Kingston on the 16th of November. This follows an agreement 
reached by the developed nations of the world on June 3 to 
ratify the United Nations convention on the Law of the Sea. 
This disclosure was made by Minister of Foreign Affairs and 
Trade Dr. Paul Robertson during his contribution to the 1994-95 
sectoral debate. Philip Hamilton has more: 
  [Begin recording] [Hamilton] The breakthrough follows years 
of intense debate between the United Nations and several 
industrialzed countries where technology [words indistinct]. 
The United States had long opposed the section of the 
convention dealing with the mining of seabed resources, an issue 
which saw them refusing to ratify the convention for well over a 
decade. Minister Robertson told parliament that Jamaica had 
played a key role in the agreement, which will be presented for 
adoption next month at the special UN General Assembly. 
  [Robertson] The main, outstanding issue involved the role 
and 
activities of the multilaterally owned enterprise in the mining 
of the seabed as against private entities. That was the 
sticking point why a number of the industrialized countries did 
not sign. 
  [Hamilton] But there has been much controversy over the site 
for the Seabed Authority's headquarters. Although Kingston was 
chosen as the headquarters interim site several years ago, 
Montego Bay has been lobbying hard for the Authority's permanent 
home. Minister Robertson says it will be some time before the 
permanent headquarters is constructed in Jamaica. He says the 
site will be determined by the United Nations based on several 
criteria, among them infrastructure as well as security.

  [Excerpt] Mexico City, 16 Jun (EFE) -- More than 10,000 
people today took part in a demonstration called by the Crusade 
for Peace. The demonstration, which followed the Zapatist 
National Liberation Army's [EZLN] refusal to sign a peace 
agreement, took place in Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Chiapas. 
  The demonstration came four days after the EZLN announced 
that it will not accept the government's response to its demands 
and that it will not sign a peace agreement in Chiapas. Most of 
the demonstrators wore white clothes, which, according to them, 
symbolize their hope for restoring peace in the state, and they 
asked that war be avoided because it will only engender more 
misery. 
  Jose Perez, leader of the Tzotzil, one of three major Indian 
groups in the area, indicated that his people want to live in 
peace and that they plan to respect the law, as long as it is 
fair and equitable. 
  Perez stressed that peace begins with respect for the law, 
adding: "We, Indians, have our own customs, which do not 
contradict the laws of the nation and which also deserve to be 
respected by the authorities." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mexico City, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Manuel Camacho 
Solis, commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas, 
resigned his post due to criticisms made by PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] Candidate Ernesto Zedillo on his role in 
the Chiapas conflict. 
  Camacho expressed his disagreement with Zedillo's position, 
which he said weakened his efforts in the political negotiations 
with the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN). 
  Camacho's resignation is in a letter to Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which Camacho read to journalists at 
a hotel in Mexico City at 2100 local (0300 GMT Friday).

<F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis 
said there are two alternatives for definitively resolving the 
unresolved Chiapas conflict: "One, the position that the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has presented, and two, 
the position which, from my point of view, should be 
strengthened -- the reinforcement of national policy but within 
republican institutions, the branches of state, and civilian 
society." 
  "There will be nuances, differences and contradictions, but 
I 
believe that as the pace of the national political debate picks 
up, as solutions and proposals are established, and as specific 
progress is made in the area of democracy, pressure will 
naturally decrease and we will make a direct contribution to the 
consolidation of peace." 
  Camacho Solis admitted this issue "has been quite complex 
from the beginning because it linked national policy to issues 
of justice in Indian communities in Chiapas and the entire 
country." That is why "we had to merge agendas into one in 
which we made a specific proposal that referred solely to 
Chiapas and to two points of national policy." 
  "The Chiapas issue has been linked and tied to the national 
political situation at all times. The political institutions 
have been responding with positive steps in this direction." 
  By seeing matters in this light, "we are able to explain 
why, 
with great responsibility, the candidates to the Presidency of 
the republic and the political parties were able to sign the 27 
January Peace, Justice, and Democracy Agreement, which reduced 
the pressure in Chiapas and continued the initiative to 
implement new changes." 
  This thing, "call it the evolution of local and national 
aspects whereby national aspects are reactivated within the 
sphere under their control as part of the justification of the 
Chiapas conflict, is what will pave the way for a final solution 
to the problem," he affirmed. 
  Interviewed by Jose Gutierrez Vivo on Radio Red, the peace 
commissioner said the Zapatists "are not asking for material 
things in exchange for not attacking the Army but, rather, for a 
new pact with the government." 
  The EZLN "is offering this possibility to maintain a 
situation of calm, but we have to admit that as long as there is 
no commitment, accidents could occur, accidents that could 
complicate the negotiations." 
  The peace commissioner expressed optimism regarding "a 
10-day 
war and five months without any deaths," a war in which the 
Mexican Army and the EZLN "have kept their commitments and 
backed a political solution to the conflict without firing one 
single shot." 
  Gutierrez asked Camacho if he accepted the opinions given 
by several sectors that he had failed in his mission to find 
peace. The commissioner said: "At this time, there is no other 
instance in the world in which a war has been interrupted so 
quickly and where a situation of nonaggression has prevailed for 
so long." 
  "The first option, he explained, was to move from a 
belligerent situation; the second, to maintain the truce; and 
the third, which we have considered optimistically, to attain 
additional advances that would allow us to consolidate the 
truce." 
  He admitted that "it is not foreseeable within the 
prevailing 
situation that the peace accords will be signed, but what is 
important are the events that occur." 
  Based on those options, "we sent a letter to the president 
of 
the republic to report on the situation since it began, trying 
to describe with all clarity the ideology, that is, the origin, 
of the conflict and the options available to the Mexican 
Government in light of the decisions the EZLN could possibly 
make." 
  "We have also prepared," he disclosed, "a letter to the EZLN 
requesting clear evidence of its nonbelligerence because this is 
what is really important, and I want to state here, with all 
clarity, that all the evidence and accounts I have requested 
from the EZLN in this respect were accepted, explicitly or 
tacitly, and, it seems to me, this is of utmost importance." 
  Camacho said that "confronted with those events, the 
tendency 
of public opinion was to say nothing was being done. This is 
quite a sensitive issue because we are complying with our 
commitment." 
  That is why, he added, "we have to make a clear-cut 
distinction in the EZLN communiques, between the political 
issues and their contents regarding security and military 
topics," because "concerning the national political issues, they 
present hard, even radical positions. I cannot complain, 
however, about their compliance with the promise of maintaining 
peace in Chiapas. In this regard, they have proceeded seriously 
and with responsibility." 
  "Of course, this would have never been possible without the 
meetings with the president of the republic who allowed the 
dialogue to further harmony, and this led to the interruption of 
the war, greater calm in Chiapas, and the consolidation of the 
truce under the prevailing conditions up to now." 
  Gutierrez asked if Mexicans are still threatened by this war 
and how will the situation be resolved completely. The peace 
commissioner replied: "The EZLN has explicitly declared it will 
not take any offensive actions, and this has a political value 
and is also significant because, logically, the Zapatists must 
justify their movements before national and international public 
opinion."

national consensus on peace. He said the negative position the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] has expressed in 
Chiapas is more a political issue than a social problem. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The peace process continues, and 
local organizations must ensure smooth progress. Allow me to 
say the efforts of the peace commissioner and the mediator have 
paved the way for the San Cristobal negotiations and certified 
the cease-fire. Their job was quite satisfactory and 
constituted a starting point for continued progress. 
  Allow me to say that despite not having a formal peace 
agreement yet, it is noteworthy to mention the cease-fire is 
still in effect, and both sides do prefer a political solution 
for peace. These two things, the cease-fire and the political 
solution, have been achieved. They confirm the strategy we 
chose to deal with the problem from the very beginning was in 
fact the correct one. 
  We have managed to build a national consensus in favor of 
peace. The EZLN's response seems to come from a more political 
decision than as the result of social or justice analyses. The 
federal government reaffirms the following: 
  1. We will proceed to ensure military security in the area 
and guarantee national sovereignty over the territory. 
  2. Current social programs will be reinforced, 
particularly for health and supplies. 
  3. Government institutions, organizations, parties, and 
society in general will participate in the continuing debate on 
the country's political and democratic progress, in accordance 
with the law. [end recording]

  [Text] San Jose, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Central America "went 
united and returned even more united" from the Ibero-American 
summit held this week in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where 
the area's proposals received a major boost, Costa Rican 
President Jose Figueres stated upon his return from the 
hemispheric meeting. 
  Figueres arrived at noon aboard an airplane provided by 
Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo in the company of 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Honduran President 
Carlos Roberto Reina, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon 
Carpio, and Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, who continued 
their journeys to their respective countries this afternoon. 
  Figueres said during a news conference that one of the 
topics 
discussed in Colombia was the possibility of negotiating jointly 
a free trade agreement in the near future, taking private 
sectors "very much into consideration." Central Americans want 
Colombia and Venezuela to grant them an asymmetrical preference 
treatment in terms of value added and place of origin rules, as 
well as in terms of the time it would take for the agreements to 
enter into force. 
  On another topic of interest to the region, namely its 
electricity power grid, Figueres said Spain is willing to 
finance the first $100 million the project costs, with the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing the remaining 
$350 million. Spain will also contribute $320 million to the 
financing the IDB will grant for other projects in those 
countries. 
  According to Figueres, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez 
pledged to decide on the Central American request to Spain to 
provide capitalization funds to the Central American Bank of 
Economic Integration (BCIE). For this purpose, Gaviria offered 
approximately $70 million, Argentine President Carlos Menem, 60 
million [currency not specified], and Venezuelan President 
Rafael Caldera talked of the possibility that his country will 
contribute 122.5 million [currency not specified], an amount 
similar to that which Mexico had provided to the BCIE. 
  Figueres said he felt "very satisfied" with the results of 
the Ibero-American summit and the accompanying bilateral and 
multilateral meetings, where, he said, the participants 
discussed the topics of democracy, independence of the Judicial 
Branch, strengthening electoral courts, commercial exchange, 
human rights, the war on poverty, and the need to boost social 
investments, among many others.

<F P=106> [Report by Arne B. Thorbjornsen: "Great Faith in Peace in </F>
Guatemala"] 
  [Text] The tone was optimistic, and trust in peace was 
strong when the two sides in the Guatemala conflict met in Oslo 
yesterday. 
  "I am expecting progress, and I am also expecting that the 
negotiations on the two topics that are up for discussion will 
be completed," UN peace mediator Jean Arnault said before the 
representatives of the government and the guerrillas in 
Guatemala began their negotiations behind closed doors in Oslo 
yesterday morning. 
  How is Guatemala to handle its settling of accounts with the 
past? This is the most tricky aspect of the whole process, and 
it is the issue which the two sides will try to resolve in the 
course of this week. There will also be discussion of new 
settlements for those who have been driven from their homes -- 
people whom the civil war has made refugees in their own country. 
  "If we find a solution to these issues, this will open the 
way to reaching our goal," Arnault said. 
  The goal is the signing of a peace agreement before the end 
of the year. Agreement on this was reached in Mexico in January 
when a timetable was drawn up for how month by month the various 
conflict issues would be dealt with. Later this year there 
will, for example, be discussion of the identity and rights of 
the aboriginal population, the distribution of land, the 
strengthening of the civilian state, the place of the army in a 
democratic society, and the integration of the guerrillas into 
political life. 
  None of these questions is easy to solve, and the settling 
of 
accounts with the past and the countless brutal breaches of 
human rights is the most difficult question of all. 
  The figures are uncertain, but it is safe to say that at 
least 130,000 people have been killed and 40,000 have 
disappeared. The aim is to set up a "truth commission" which 
will look into what has happened, and it is revelations 
regarding its role in massacres and purges that the military 
machine fears most of all. The armed forces have claimed the 
whole time that they do not see the need for a truth commission. 
Kirkens Nodhjelp [Church Emergency Aid] in particular has 
played a role as a bridge-builder and helped to get the army to 
agree to negotiations on this sensitive issue. 
  In his welcome speech to the envoys, Foreign Minister Bjorn 
Tore Godal said that Norway is ready to make its contribution to 
guarantee the economic base for the peace process. He also 
stressed that peace is more than the absence of war, and it can 
only be created by the parties themselves. 
  The leaders of the two delegations both stressed how 
important it is that a truth commission be set up. "Clearing up 
the past opens the door to the future," said Dr. Hector Rosada, 
the government chief negotiator. The leader of the guerrilla 
group, Carlos Gonzalez, said that it is important not only to 
investigate breaches of human rights and to prevent new breaches 
taking place, but also to punish where this is necessary.

  [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 13 Jun (EFE) -- 
Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today said he is very 
optimistic about the way the peace talks in Oslo, between his 
government and the guerrillas, are going. De Leon, who arrived 
today in Cartagena de Indias to attend the Fourth Ibero-American 
Summit told EFE that "the discussion of the displaced persons is 
being concluded." This issue was one of the biggest obstacles 
in the past two months of talks in Mexico. 
  In Mexico, the Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan 
National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) discussed a solution for the 
resettling of thousands of peasants who have fled the war torn 
areas in northern Guatemala since 1960. The return of the 
displaced persons was not agreed on during the talks in Mexico 
because the government demanded a cease-fire in the area which 
the rebels refused to accept if progress was not made in other 
areas. 
  Ramiro de Leon, who was sworn in as president of Guatemala a 
year ago following Jorge Serrano's foiled self-inflicted coup, 
told EFE that he believes the talks in Norway are "positive" and 
added that he is waiting for more news on the meeting. 
  The Oslo meeting was scheduled to discuss the creation of 
the 
Truth Commission which, as in the Salvadoran case, would 
investigate crimes and human rights violations during the 
conflict; however, the Guatemalan Government does not want to 
advance on this issue until an agreement is reached on the 
displaced persons. 
  The Guatemalan Government and the URNG began peace talks in 
1991, but it was not until this year that they reached an 
agreement regarding human rights and the drafting of a timetable 
for negotiations that should end this year with the signing of a 
peace agreement.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 16 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Official sources 
confirmed today that a group of unidentified people dynamited an 
electricity pylon in the municipality of Concepcion in the 
southern department of Escuintla. As a result, several 
communities have no electricity. 
  The National Police indicated that early this morning 
several 
men planted dynamite cartridges on two of the four sides of the 
pylon, which was partly destroyed while the homes of some 
100,000 people were left without electric power. 
  According to the Police, the Army arrived in the area and 
began to comb the mountains for those responsible for the attack. 
  The Police said that last Saturday another two electricity 
pylons were dynamited in the country's interior, and no victims 
have been reported yet. 
  The attacks took place within the framework of the meeting 
between the government and the Guatemalan guerrillas in Oslo, 
Norway, where the parties are considering the creation of a 
Verification Commission of the Historic Past. Guatemala has 
endured a 34-year armed conflict, which has resulted in some 
175,000 victims.

  [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, Honduran Armed 
Forces commander in chief, said during the ceremony closing the 
Department of National Investigation (DNI) respect for the law 
requires a coercive power. He termed as historic the work 
performed by the DNI, which has been forced to yield to a new 
organization conceived within the framework of state 
modernization in line with the process of transformation, which 
is shaking the foundations of public and private institutions. 
  The top military chief said that justice is the gauge of 
civilization and that the greatest ruin of a nation is not that 
many of its residents do not fear God, but that those who do not 
fear God do not fear the law either. He said that as bad as it 
is that men do not feel subject to a powerful, moral law, it is 
even worse that they do not respect the legal system, which is 
what makes public order, social peace, and human coexistence 
possible. 
  Discua said that the police forces were born as auxiliaries 
of justice and that what has happened recently is an indication 
the world is preparing for the advent of a better society. 
  "That is how we understand it, and we accept it that way. We 
believe in those who will henceforth have to handle these 
matters," he added. Discua said that personnel of the current 
Directorate of Criminal Investigation earn a decent salary and 
that professional training and social sensitivity are 
requirements that further the state's interests. 
  He said the members of the defunct DNI have fulfilled their 
work in the face of every adversity and act of ingratitude. He 
admitted that those agents have made mistakes, and, being human, 
were not as perfect as their critics and that they lacked the 
supernatural qualities claimed by those who offended and 
insulted them everyday. 
  "The fatherland and thinking citizens will recognize their 
sacrifice someday," the military chief added, referring to the 
DNI agents who stood for five hours on the parade grounds of the 
National Police School (Anapo).

  [Text] Tegucigalpa -- Army Commander General Guillermo 
Paredes has said the joint patrols Honduran and Nicaraguan 
troops are conducting along the border are yielding positive 
results. The military chief has said the operation along the 
border consists of an inspection of each area, although the 
troops coincide only in certain points to coordinate actions 
against delinquents, rearmed groups, or drug traffickers. 
  He added the war on drug trafficking, which has been 
intensified in recent days, is primarily a police task, but the 
military force is present to provide support whenever necessary. 
He explained it is inadvisable to report on the border patrol 
operations, because that would alert delinquents. 
  Paredes has also said the ceremony marking the closing of 
the 
DNI [Department of National Investigation] was an appropriate 
recognition of those who devoted their lives to serving the 
fatherland. In addition, the ranking officer has said that the 
DNI had heroes who gave their lives in service of their country 
and that this was an indication of loyalty and devotion. 
Paredes has said the DNI closure is a historic event, because a 
civilian corps technical in nature will replace this institution. 
  Modern times point to new paths, Paredes has said, but we 
must be careful whenever substantial changes are made in 
organizations that are in charge of public security, because an 
error of appreciation could generate problems in the near 
future. The DNI, he added, has to be replaced by a corps with 
greater professional outreach, capable of facing the high crime 
rate that has beset the Honduran nation.

country's economic strategy for the next three years. 
  [Begin recording] [Taboada] The agenda deals with 
Nicaragua's 
cooperation, reform, and modernization, the transformation of 
its social agenda, and its need for technical, economic, and 
social assistance. 
  [Pereira] Approximately $310 million of the $550 to $560 
million that we expect to borrow in 1994 has virtually been 
obtained. [end recording] 
  The officials reported that they will request a total of 
$1.6 
billion for the next three years. In addition, they reported 
that the IMF and the World Bank will approve loans soon. 
  [Begin Taboada recording] The IMF director and the World 
Bank 
Board of Directors on 22 and 23 June will study Nicaragua's 
request, after which we expect to receive the first 
disbursements. [end recording] 
  One of the subjects to be explained to the Paris Club is the 
progress attained in the solution of problems related to the 
confiscation of real estate owned by foreigners. 
  [Begin Pereira recording] We are confident there will be no 
problems. I am taking a report of all the cases that have been 
settled and whose solutions meet other countries' demands with 
me in my portfolio. [end recording]

  [Text] The Compania Panamena de Aviacion (COPA) airline 
will suspend its two weekly flights to Haiti beginning on 26 
June to comply with UN sanctions. Deputy Foreign Minister 
Carlos G. Cordero announced the measure, stating that the 
suspension of flights to Haiti complies with the commercial 
blockade imposed by the United Nations and the OAS against the 
Raoul Cedras military regime. 
  Cordero told the media that yesterday, "acting President 
Guillermo Ford Boyd signed the decree establishing the 
prohibition of flights to Port-au-Prince effective 26 June." 
  COPA was the only Latin American airline covering the route 
to the Caribbean nation. Regarding this measure, a COPA source 
said the company does not yet have the official notification 
from the central government. The airline official said that 
General Manager Pedro Heilbron will be returning from a trip to 
Miami tomorrow and that Deputy Manager Moises Veliz is on 
vacation. 
  When LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA previously interviewed Heilbron, 
he said the company "will comply with the government's order as 
long as the U.S. airlines suspend their commercial flights to 
Haiti." 
  According to Heilbron, the U.S. companies "did not comply" 
with the previous two sanctions established by the international 
organizations against the Caribbean island. 
  The COPA flights to Haiti mainly carry Haitian businessmen 
and merchants coming to Panama to make purchases in the Colon 
Free Zone.

denied today that it could be considered a defeat that the 
chiefs of state participating in the Ibero-American Summit had 
not issued an opinion against abortion, as "only three or four 
countries" had opposed his proposal, for which reason the 
required unanimity was not obtained. 
  Menem also indicated that he "absolutely" was not bothered 
by 
the demonstration, called the Federal March to Plaza de Mayo, 
announced by state unions in the interior of the country, as 
long as they do not "create any kind of disturbances." 
  The president made these remarks upon arriving at the 
Metropolitan Airport from Colombia just before 0800.

  [Text] Buenos Aires, 16 Jun (EFE) -- Panamanian President 
Guillermo Endara today began a private visit to Buenos Aires 
through a special invitation from his Argentine colleague, 
Carlos Menem. 
  The two chiefs of state travelled together to Buenos Aires 
from the Colombian city of Cartagena de Indias, where the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit closed on 15 June. 
  During the summit, the Central American countries obtained 
economic support from Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela and 
political support for Honduras in its quest for a seat on the UN 
Security Council and the holding of the Ibero-American Summit in 
Panama in the year 2000. 
  Endara's stay in Buenos Aires, where he will meet several 
times with Menem, will conclude on 19 June, according to the 
Honduran [as received] Embassy in Buenos Aires.

  [Text] The Supreme Court might have to decide between the 
reelection of Carlos Menem or Eduardo Duhalde now that disputes 
involving both [national and Buenos Aires Province] constituent 
assemblies have ended in court. 
  In the case of the National Constituent Assembly, minority 
blocs sought a court injunction to get the Assembly to respect 
their right to vote on the 13 agreements of the package closed 
by Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin item by item. The assembly 
had decided the 13 amendments will be voted on as a single 
package. Radical [Radical Civic Union, UCR] and Justicialist 
[Justicialist Party, PJ] leaders will appeal Judge Raul Dalla 
Fontana's decision to allow the complaints of provincial 
parties. The Supreme Court will now decide if the courts can 
consider Constituent Assembly decisions. The parties that 
signed the pact [UCR and PJ] want the court to dismiss the 
complaint on the grounds that Constituent Assembly decisions 
cannot be considered by the courts. 
  If the court dismisses the complaint it will hurt Eduardo 
Duhalde, whose followers have filed a petition arguing that 
regulations approved by the Grand Front, Modin [Movement for 
Independence and Dignity], and UCR alliance are 
unconstitutional. If the court decides it cannot consider 
National Constituent Assembly decisions it will also be unable 
to discuss the Buenos Aires Constituent Assembly regulations and 
Duhalde will be unable to change the regulation that bans him 
from seeking reelection.

    [Editorial Report] 
<H8>  Businessmen Scrutinize Economic Policy </H8>
  The business sector "Group of Eight," composed of the 
Argentine Banking Association (ABRA), the Argentine Industrial 
Union (UIA), the Argentine Union of Construction (UAC), the 
Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba), the Commodity Exchange, 
the Chamber of Commerce (CAC), the Argentine Construction Board 
(CAC), and the Argentine Rural Society (SRA), has decided to 
meet regularly, "at intervals no greater than 30 days, to 
analyze key aspects of [the Argentine Government's] economic 
policy and its political and social implications," reported the 
12 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. According to the daily, the 
current Constituent Assembly as well as the 1995 presidential 
elections are the reasons why this "exclusive" group of 
"business organizations most plugged into power" has decided to 
meet more frequently. Key topics discussed at the group's second 
meeting this year on 11 May were labor flexibility, 
privatizations in the provinces, and the deregulation of labor 
union and business sector pension plans. "Without labor 
flexibility, we won't be able to attack the scourge of 
unemployment," asserted Chamber of Commerce President Jorge 
Fiori. According to another report in the 11 May LA NACION, 
other topics on the agenda were the Argentine Government's 
social policy, exports, tariffs, and the desirability of lifting 
the economic state of emergency. "Even though there are issues 
still pending in the country, economic conditions are no longer 
uncertain," according to an unidentified leader of the Argentine 
Construction Board. 
<H8>  Banks Seek Reduced Costs </H8>
  Bankers belonging to the Association of Argentine Banks 
(Adeba) have called for the elimination of taxes and other 
expenses which "significantly" push up the costs of doing 
business and thus the price charged for financial services, 
reported the 13 May Buenos Aires LA PRENSA. The main obstacles 
to cost reduction cited by Adeba bankers are: 
  --the social security contribution; 
  --the Institute of Banking Social Services (ISSB) 
contribution, the equivalent of 2 percent of banking commissions 
and interest. This expenditure, which is equal to 11.7 percent 
of bank personnel salaries and "eats up" 4 percent of 
administrative expenses, "must be abolished," insisted the 
bankers; 
  --the absence of a tax deduction from gross earnings for 
banking activities in Buenos Aires, where 60 percent of 
financial operations take place. Such a tax deduction would save 
7 percent of bank administrative costs; 
  --physical security expenses, which absorb $500,000 monthly 
and constitute 2 percent of administrative expenses; 
  --check-holding requirements, which cause high outlays for 
transfers; 
  --minimum reserve requirements which do not include branch 
office assets and funds in transit. 
  "Even though the peso system has a 40 percent reserve 
requirement, in reality it becomes 65 percent of deposits" since 
the branch office assets and funds in transit are not included, 
continued LA NACION. Eduardo Escasany, Adeba president and Banco 
de Galicia head, explained that "the 40 percent reserve is 
necessary because there is no guarantee on deposits." He added, 
however, that banks "should work with the additional 25 
percent." 
<H8>  Study of Provincial Financial Markets </H8>
  The Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) and the Argentine 
Industrial Union (UIA) have formed a working group to study the 
causes of high interest rates in the provinces and their impact 
on small and medium-sized businesses (PYMES), reported the 13 
May Buenos Aires daily LA PRENSA. The goal of the joint 
commission is to evaluate provincial financial markets and come 
up with solutions to the high cost of credit which hinders 
production. 
<H8>  Former Economy Minister on Exports Trend </H8>
  While recognizing that Argentina's ratio of exports to Gross 
Domestic Product (5 percent) is "pitifully small," former 
Economy Minister Roberto Alemann has predicted that the country 
will increase exports due to a retooling of businesses, the 
recovery of the international economy, and better market access 
following the GATT agreement, according to the 8 May Buenos 
Aires LA NACION. 
  After suffering with "the worst trade terms of the century" 
for the past two or three years, Alemann asserted, there would 
be substantial improvements for agricultural exports. He said it 
looked like the 40 million tons of grains that Argentina 
exported in 1993 might bring in $1 billion more during 1994 for 
a total of $5 billion. As a result of the GATT agreement, he 
added, Argentina has secured the sale of 11,000 tons per year of 
special cuts of high-quality meat to the European Union (EU) at 
a cost of $100 million, as well as an annual 20,000-ton quota 
from the United States. "Argentina may also benefit from a 
change in the European Union's meat stocks, which dropped 1 
million tons in 1993 to less than 400,000." He explained that if 
these stocks continue to shrink at such a fast pace, by the end 
of 1994 nothing will be left, in which case meat prices may 
improve and Argentina may reclaim its role as a great meat 
exporter. Alemann concluded that, in general, the outlook for 
Argentine exports was favorable due to cuts in U.S. and EU 
subsidies, the reduction of quotas, and prospects for better 
prices. 
  Regarding improvements for Argentine exports due to 
conditions inside the country, Alemann pointed to hydrocarbons. 
"Argentina is already producing around 40 million cubic meters 
of oil, a large portion of which is exported. The oil pipeline 
to Chile alone channels exports worth $500 million annually." 
He also mentioned "the enormous gas field recently discovered 
off the coast of Tierra del Fuego," another site under study in 
Salta, and the Loma de la Lata-Santiago de Chile gasline as 
other good potential sources of foreign exchange. The former 
minister added that currently there are 40 mining projects under 
way in Argentina. A $600 million investment has been announced 
for the Bajo de la Alumbrera site alone, while $100 million will 
be invested at Salar de Hombre Muerto. "All this production will 
be exported," asserted Alemann. "Argentina will be a great 
exporter of lithium and its by-products. For the first time, the 
country will be exporting large quantities of minerals, among 
them gold, copper, and silver. We'll have to give this sector a 
couple of years and the results may be startling." 
  Alemann also predicted that the fishing sector would 
increase 
exports by $200 million in 1994. 
<H8>  Argentine Businessmen `Prefer Domestic Market' </H8>
  According to Secretary for International Economic 
Negotiations Jorge Campbell, Argentine businessmen prefer the 
domestic market, reported the 8 May Buenos Aires LA NACION. In 
response to repeated criticism with regard to the slow growth of 
Argentine exports, Campbell explained that the trade balance is 
not meaningful unless it reflects permanent links that help 
sustain growth. "If sales are not sustainable over time, 
businesses, and therefore the economy, will most likely swing 
back and forth between export production and production directed 
at the domestic market." He said that one of the difficulties of 
boosting exports is that production aimed at the domestic market 
is "still more profitable." One of the challenges facing 
Argentina, he added, is to reach a point at which it makes no 
difference to businesses whether they sell to the domestic 
market or abroad. Campbell concluded that Argentina needs to 
develop an "export culture" that will contribute to "breaking 
through [Argentina's] isolation from the rest of the world."

  [Excerpt] Brasilia, 15 Jun (AE) -- Finance Minister Rubens 
Ricupero today discarded any possibility of increasing the 
minimum wage. He said Congress has a solution to the 
readjustment. Ricupero pointed out: "Unfortunately the 
constitutional reform was not concluded and the federal 
government has no way to modify what is established in the 
Constitution or in federal laws." 
  The minister explained that any minimum wage increase is 
directly conditioned to the need to dissociate the national 
minimum wage from the minimum pension paid by the Social 
Security Ministry. The government also wants a definition on 
the proposal that states and mayoralties of the poorest 
Brazilian regions be allowed to pay a different minimum wage. 
The two modifications should have been approved during the 
constitutional reform because the 1988 Constitution establishes 
that the smallest pension paid by the Social Security Ministry 
must equal one minimum wage. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The Communications Ministry records of radio and 
television station shareholders show that the Brazilian market 
has a great radio broadcasting empire headed by the family of 
businessman Roberto Marinho. 
  The listing of franchises recorded at the Communications 
Ministry shows that the Marinho family has the largest number of 
main stations in markets where the purchasing power is greatest. 
  The Marinho family has stations in Brasilia, Recife, and Rio 
de Janeiro. It has four of its own and two in partnership in 
the state of Sao Paulo; two of its own and one in partnership in 
Minas Gerais; and four more in partnership in Parana State. 
  The SBT (Brazilian Television System) of the Silvio Santos 
group has nine television stations in the name of companies that 
belong to the Abravanel family (Abravanel is the surname of 
Silvio Santos). 
  The group has six franchises in the southeastern region 
(four 
in Sao Paulo and two in Rio de Janeiro), one in Rio Grande do 
Sul, one in Brasilia, and another in Para. 
  The Saad family, which owns the Bandeirantes network, has 
four television franchises in the state of Sao Paulo, and one in 
each of the following capitals: Curitiba, Brasilia, Belo 
Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Salvador. 
  The Saad and Sirotsky families hold the largest number of 
radio stations; each own 21 stations. 
  The Manchete group, according to Communications Ministry 
records, has three stations in the southeastern region (Sao 
Paulo, Belo Horizonte, and Rio de Janeiro) and two in the 
northeast: Fortaleza and Recife. 
  According to a survey conducted by Intermeios (of the 
magazine MEIO &amp; MENSAGEM [MEDIA AND MESSAGE]), the amount 
collected from advertisements by television stations last year 
was approximately $1.3 billion, while the amount collected by 
radios was approximately $100 million. 
  The market estimate is that Globo and its affiliated members 
collect more than 60 percent of the money obtained from 
television adverstisements, while SBT and its affiliated members 
receive around 20 percent. 
  The strongest radio broadcasting groups in the country are 
affiliated with Rede Globo, as are the stations belonging to the 
most influential political leaders, which increases Roberto 
Marinho's political power. 
  In the southern part of the country the market is dominated 
by the Sirotsky family, owner of the RBS [Rede Brasiliera do 
Sul] network, affiliated with Globo. Members of the family have 
10 television franchises in Rio Grande do Sul (plus two under 
its administration by commercial agreement), and three in Santa 
Catarina. 
  In addition to the south, the Sirotsky family also appears 
as 
shareholders of one station of Itapemirim television, in 
Cachoeiro do Itapemirim. The shareholder of this company is the 
Gazeta group from Espiritu Santo, which is also affiliated with 
Globo. 
  In the northern region, the Amazonas Radio and Television 
group, which belongs to the Daou family, has main stations -- 
affiliated with Globo -- in Roraima, Rondonia, Acre, Amapa, and 
Amazonas. It is the strongest group in the region. 
  In the central west, the two strongest groups -- the Camara 
family in Goias and Tocantins, and the Zahran family (Mato 
Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso) -- are also affiliated with 
Globo. The Camara family has seven television and 12 radio 
franchises, while the Zahran family has four television and one 
radio franchise. 
  In the northeast, the only group that has franchises in more 
than one state is the Jereissati family (Verdes Mares group): 
two radio and one television station in Ceara (affiliated with 
Globo), one radio station in Rio de Janeiro, and another in 
Alagoas. 
  The strongest local groups in the largest northeastern 
states 
are linked to politicians. 
  In Bahia, Federal Deputy Pedro Irujo Yaniz (PMDB [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party]) has two television franchises 
(affiliated with the SBT) and four radio stations. His son Luiz 
Pedro Irujo is a partner of the Marinho family in two Globo 
radios in the state. 
  The main Bahia State television station affiliated with 
Globo 
is TV Bahia, which has among its shareholders federal Deputy 
Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (PFL [Liberal Front Party]), son of 
former Communications Minister and former Governor Antonio 
Carlos Magalhaes, and Cesar Mata Pires, Carlos Magalhaes' 
son-in-law. 
  In Sergipe, the family of Senator Albano Franco (PSDB 
[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]) makes up the strongest radio 
broadcasting group: It has two television stations (one 
affiliated with Globo and another with SBT), and three radio 
franchises. 
  In Alagoas and in Maranhao, the stations affiliated with 
Globo belong to the families of two former presidents of the 
Republic. 
  In Maranhao, TV Mirante, affiliated with Globo, is listed as 
being under the name of Jose Sarney's sons (1985-90), who also 
own four radio stations. 
  Former President Fernando Collor de Mello (1990-92) is among 
the shareholders of Gazeta TV, affiliated with Globo, in Alagoas. 
  In Rio Grande do Norte, former Regional Intergration 
Minister 
Aluizio Alves is among the main partners of TV Cabugi, 
affiliated with Globo.
