  [Text] Santiago, 20 Jun (EFE) -- The 2,800 inhabitants of 
Easter Island, a Chilean possession in the Pacific Ocean located 
3,600 km from the continent, are on strike as of 20 June 
demanding the recovery of their land from the Chilean Government 
and a senator and a deputy to represent them in Congress. 
  The afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA reported today that the 
strike was called for by the Rapa Nui Elders Council and 
conveyed in a letter addressed to island Governor Jacobo Hey. 
  The peaceful strike will continue until a direct dialogue is 
held with the Chilean Government to solve a number of conflicts 
affecting the island community, according to a note released by 
the strikers. 
  Easter Island, in a tropical climate, lives on tourism 
generated by the presence of 867 statues that represent gigantic 
figures of up to 20 meters high called "moais," placed in 
ceremonial temples called "ahu," which make this territory look 
like an open-air archaeological museum.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Gabriela Coutino] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Peasant and 
Indian members of the State Council of Indian and Peasant 
Organizations [CEOIC] who have been waging a sit-down strike are 
refusing to put their trust in and open negotiations with 
Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno and other representatives 
of the federal government because, they argue, "we signed a 
draft agreement with them on 4 April and they failed to comply." 
  Meanwhile, Lopez Moreno has explained to the media that he 
is 
not the federal government's commissioner for peace and 
reconciliation in Chiapas: "As governor, it is my duty to 
coordinate compliance with federal and local agreements intended 
to strengthen peace." Lopez Moreno convened a news conference to 
discuss the status of the state. In addition, he maintained 
that conditions exist for holding elections on 21 August. 
  He indicated that within the past 40 hours, significant 
progress has been achieved at the five bargaining tables that 
were set up to establish a more direct dialogue with CEOIC 
members. He did not, however, give any details, and he would 
only say "they were discussing" the agenda outlined by the 
organization. 
  As for the upcoming elections, Lopez Moreno stated: "We are 
moving on satisfactorily, and we maintain good relations with 
all political organizations." Tonight, he indicated he will 
hold a meeting with ranchers and small rural landowners to 
jointly set up a working agenda -- following the same pattern 
used with the CEOIC -- and, in turn, respond to complaints made 
by the ranchers. 
  The peasants, meanwhile, pointed out that the government is 
still lying and that no substantial progress or results have 
come from their negotiations. The Emiliano Zapata Proletariat 
Organization [OPEZ], a member of the CEOIC, noted in a news 
release: "The government is encouraging ranchers and landowners 
by claiming that it will act in keeping with the law (land 
evictions) to recover seized properties." 
  It says that in light of this situation, President Salinas 
should handle the Chiapas problem himself. Having lost hope, 
the peasants view "the system as their historic enemy." The 
news release states that Chiapas is experiencing a class 
conflict in which the government has ceased to be an arbiter and 
has become the ally of the rich. The rich put the government in 
power, and the rich expect to benefit from government policies. 
  This is why Colosio was assassinated, OPEZ adds. Camacho was 
forced to resign because the government still believes Chiapas 
will be a deciding factor in the upcoming elections. 
  But now, OPEZ asserts, current circumstances favor us. A 
unique situation exists, because now there is a Zapatist 
National Liberation Army [EZLN]. "There are no peace 
agreements," elections are coming, and society has great 
expectations. If there are no solutions, we "will radicalize" 
our position by seizing land and carrying out actions to force 
the government to heed us and answer our demands. 
  Another situation affecting the state stems from discontent 
in several local mayor's offices. Following six days in jail, 
four municipal officials from Angel Albino Corzo were freed by 
peasants who demanded an investigation into the case and the 
mayor's dismissal. According to the Chiapas Public Prosecutor's 
Office, the municipal presidency remains closed to prevent any 
aggression. 
<H5>  Proposals From the Chiapas Diocese </H5>
  Tuxtla Gutierrez Bishop Felipe Aguirre Franco said three 
Chiapas dioceses will present several plans and proposals to the 
federal government on the armed conflict. Pope John Paul II 
will give his authorization for this action. 
  Aguirre Franco added that the bishops' proposal has been 
addressed to the Mexican Government through Samuel Ruiz Garcia, 
bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. At this point, Aguirre 
Franco believes that both the federal and the state governments 
are making "adjustments," but this does not mean that 
negotiations are at a standstill but, rather, that the new EZLN 
proposals are being studied. 
  Aguirre mentioned that on 1-11 July he will be in Rome, 
where 
he will meet with the pope. He will submit an in-depth report 
on the works conducted by his diocese within the past six years 
to the pope. He will also give his view regarding the armed 
Indian uprising in the area of the Chiapas highlands and the 
Lacandona Jungle, and he will give a thorough account of 
developments since the EZLN's emergence.

<F P=106> [Report by correspondent Betzy Villarreal Rodas] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- Today, Governor 
Javier Lopez Moreno, federal and state coordinator of peace 
efforts in Chiapas, said he is awaiting a reply from the 
Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] to begin exchanging 
work plans and commitments that will lead to the signing of a 
regional peace agreement. 
  Lopez Moreno, however, pointed out that he is not currently 
seeking a dialogue with the EZLN in the buffer zones. He added 
that he will meet today with Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia, when the 
prelate returns from a trip. 
  The state governor delivered a message to the people of 
Mexico and Chiapas: "We are not experiencing the worst of 
conditions, and we are making progress." I trust the EZLN's 
conditions will be appropriate for the holding of elections, and 
even the electoral campaign. 
  He admitted he has good relations with all political 
organizations in the state. He also said he was in a position 
to resolve the agenda proposed by the State Council of the 
Indian and Peasant Organizations as well as to resolve the 
concerns expressed by the small landholders, particularly the 
cattle ranchers. 
  He advised that there are problems in some municipalities in 
the state, such as land seizures, the blocking of highways, and 
unrest in the zones of conflict. Nevertheless, he said, the 
situation is under control.

<F P=106> [By Noel Lorthiois] </F>
  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Just two months before 
the 21 August Mexican presidential elections, and for the first 
time in 65 years, the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] 
appears seriously threatened, while the popularity of the 
conservative opposition candidate continues to rise. 
  By offering sound alternatives, Catholic attorney Diego 
Fernandez de Ceballos, 53, candidate of the National Action 
Party (PAN, conservative), continues to gain more ground with 
each passing day, according to opinion polls published in the 
Mexican capital in recent weeks. 
  Moreover, according to a government official who asked to 
remain anonymous, as of two weeks ago, unpublished polls showed 
that "one day, the PRI candidate was leading Diego Fernandez 36 
to 34 percent, and the next day, the opposite was true." In 
Mexico, the president is elected by a simple majority and 
universal suffrage in a single-round election. 
  Fernandez's popularity rose markedly after the 12 May 
televised debate between the three main presidential candidates. 
All commentators agreed that the PAN candidate, an excellent 
speaker who is graced with undeniable charisma, was the 
hands-down winner of the debate. This was the first such debate 
organized in Mexico, and it was seen by nearly 50 million 
viewers. 
  Meanwhile, the PRI, which is bogged down in a true crisis 
that reflects the end of its era and shows it is being ripped 
apart by internal quarrels, is losing more sympathizers each and 
every day, and it is obvious that its candidate Ernesto Zedillo, 
43, does not convince the people. 
  Zedillo has the disadvantage of having been hastily 
appointed 
barely three months ago in the wake of the murder of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the previous PRI candidate. Zedillo's entire 
career has taken place within ministries (specifically the 
Budget and Education Ministries) and he has never held an 
elected post. He is considered a brilliant technocrat. 
  According to analysts, Zedillo is a victim of the erosion of 
his party, which was created in 1929 by Plutarco Elias Calles. 
The party no longer responds to its initial vocation of being a 
"party of the state" designed to ensure the nation's stability. 
  In fact, within the past six months, the Mexicans have 
watched with consternation a guerrilla rebellion in Chiapas 
State (south), where the conflict still has not been resolved, 
despite the cease-fire; Colosio's murder; a rise in violence and 
kidnappings; and a unsettling increase in drug trafficking. 
Meanwhile, the PRI candidate himself recognizes it is necessary 
to "urgently and deeply" reform justice and the police. 
  After 65 years of PRI rule and in the wake of true 
modernization undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
the Mexicans undoubtedly expect a political change. 
Furthermore, the slogan of "democratic transition" is recalled 
daily as an unavoidable fact, not only by the opposition 
parties, but also by PRI dissidents, the Catholic Church, 
countless intellectuals, and the main political editorial 
writers. 
  The question is who will be able to assure this transition 
and how it will be achieved. As of now, it is believed that the 
PRI probably will not be able to continue ruling alone. 
Nevertheless, it appears unlikely that any elected opposition 
candidate would be able to rule without the PRI, taking into 
account the current alignment of forces. 
  Salinas, who has always maintained that he will turn over 
power to whoever wins the election, will have to face this 
challenge, guarantee transparent elections, and oversee a 
transition without upheavals; otherwise, the nation could sink 
into serious political turmoil.

  [Text] Mexico City, 18 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Mexican Federal 
Electoral Institute (IFE) General Council announced today that 
it will monitor the media to see if reports on the presidential 
candidates' campaigns are fair and objective. During a regular 
session this Saturday, IFE members unanimously agreed to order 
the institution's Radio Broadcasts Commission to file a report 
on their findings by the end of the month at the latest. 
  The Commission is to report to the Council every 15 days 
until the political campaigns conclude on the handling of 
information reported by the media. 
  Over 40 million Mexicans will go to the polls during 21 
August's federal elections to choose a president, 500 deputies, 
128 senators, and 66 Assembly members. The IFE General Council 
plan includes a recommendation to the media, mainly radio and 
television stations, to balance information on the political 
campaigns of the various parties. It also asks the electronic 
media to respect, in their radio and television newscasts, the 
right of Mexicans to be informed about the campaign activities 
of the nine presidential candidates.

  [Text] Progreso, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- It was reported here 
that the Cuban fishermen who arrived in this Mexican eastern 
port, in Yucatan State, asked the government to help them reach 
Florida after they were declared illegal immigrants in Mexico. 
  Bernardo Crespo, navigation chief of the Progreso port, 
pointed out that Cubans Amado Sanchez Garay, 35, and Roberto 
Perez Ruiz, 38, had said they left Cuba 14 days ago to go 
fishing and that a Mexican ship rescued them on 20 June. 
  The official added the Cubans, who were on board a 
high-speed 
boat with registration number 302-322, arrived in the port, 
located 1,800 km east of Mexico City, early this morning and 
they requested help to go to Miami, Florida. The Lamba 302 
fishing boat rescued the two fishermen, whose high-speed boat 
ran out of gas on the high seas. 
  Crespo also said the Cuban fishermen were handed over to 
immigration authorities, who transferred them to Merida, 
Yucatan's capital, located 36 km south of Progreso. 
  Some 193 Cubans have arrived in Yucatan Peninsula coasts so 
far in 1994. In March, seven Cuban boat people were rescued off 
the coast of Isla Contoy, and in April, three groups -- totaling 
183 Cubans -- arrived in this port, Chetumal Bay, near Isla 
Mujeres. 
  Last month, Cuban fisherman Pedro Gutierrez Fernandez 
arrived 
in San Felipe Port, also in Yucatan, after he was rescued by the 
Piscis Mexican fishing boat.

  [Text] In an incident described by the PGR [Attorney 
General's Office] as one of the harshest blows dealt to the drug 
trafficking mafia, on 15 June, authorities arrested Moises 
Juarez Ledezma, alias El Moyo and El Dienton, a key figure in 
the Sonora Cartel headed by Amado Carrillo Fuentes. El Moyo has 
been charged with crimes against public health, which include 
charges of funding, planting, cultivating, storing, and 
transporting drugs. 
  In the areas of Las Minitas and Las Trincheras in Sonora, 
which cover some 5,800 hectares, authorities confirmed the 
discovery of caps and jackets with bogus PGR and PJF [Federal 
Judicial Police] insignias, which were used by cartel members. 
  Meanwhile, the PGR also announced the 12 June arrest of 
Eduardo Salazar Carrillo, assistant PJF inspector in Sinaloa; 
Commander 2d Class Cesar Gomez Castaneda; and policemen Gilberto 
Barrios Barrios and Eric Escamilla Segovia. The four men are 
facing charges in connection with the possession of $306,921 in 
cash, several weapons used exclusively by the Army, and radio 
equipment.

  In a two-paragraph communique, the Defense Secretariat noted 
that it has not taken any official steps to obtain such military

approved the request for the acquisition of such armaments, 
considering the arrival of the equipment as untimely in view of

  The Defense Secretariat said the Army and Air Force's

  [Text] Pedro Aspe, secretary of finance and public credit 
-- without directly mentioning Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho 
Solis' resignation -- has said that recently we have been 
wrapped up in an unexpected problem that has disheartened many 
Mexicans. 
  Athough domestic as well as foreign events have translated 
into uncertainty in domestic markets, we should be conscious of 
the temporary nature of these events and not lose sight of the 
important economic progress we have achieved, Aspe said. 
  During yesterday's inauguration of Banco Capital -- a new 
institution comprising several banks belonging to the Capital 
Financial Group -- Pedro Aspe said the banking sector is moving 
toward universal banking. This not only means that a wide range 
of financial services will now be offered through bank windows, 
but it also implies the creation of special market niches and 
increased competitive advantages in a dynamic market. According 
to information delivered by Aspe, the new bank will initiate 
operations with paid capital of 120 million pesos, and its aim 
will be to offer services to small and medium-sized industries, 
particularly in Mexico City. Banco Capital now joins the 
invoicing, renting, and guarantee companies previously held by 
Capital Group. 
  According to Jaime Weiss, chairman of this financial group's 
Board of Directors, capital has grown from 3 million new pesos 
at the beginning of 1990 to 420 million new pesos at the end of 
last month. The executive said that another division -- 
institutional investments -- has been added to the existing one 
-- which in the coming months will feature 280 million new pesos 
to achieve total capital of 700 million new pesos. 
  Jaime Weiss also indicated that in 1993, Capital Financial 
Group placed 723 million new pesos in new credit among 3,563 
customers, and, should this trend continue, it has scheduled the 
placing of more than 1 billion new pesos among 1,200 new 
customers. 
  The new institution will have a nationwide presence and is 
scheduled to open four branches this year. The services offered 
will include investment services, consumer credit, contract 
loans, bridge loans, and nonrevolving mortgages, along with 
trustee services, foreign exchange and credit services via 
automatic tellers, as well as others.

<F P=106> [Report by Javier Rodriguez] </F>
  [Text] The Institute for Studies on the Democratic 
Revolution [IERD] of the PRD [Party of the Democratic 
Revolution] has opened a forum to analyze the party's economic 
proposals. At the opening session, Porfirio Munoz Ledo 
criticized the economic program of Ernesto Zedillo and the 
proposals of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] leader 
to "eradicate poverty" in the country. 
  IERD Director Efigenia Martinez also harshly criticized 
Zedillo's proposals and described as demagogic the plan to 
eradicate poverty with "programs against poverty" when 
investment, employment, good salaries, and a fair social policy 
offering equal opportunities are those things that are needed to 
achieve this goal. 
  Munoz Ledo accused Zedillo of drafting one of the most 
deceitful government programs ever seen in Mexico. This 
program, he added, was drafted at a time when the current PRI 
presidential candidate headed the now-defunct Secretariat of 
Programming and Budget. 
  The PRD national leader noted that in Zedillo's growth 
program for the country, Zedillo "did not offer a 6-percent GNP 
growth rate for this year, a splendid macroeconomy, higher 
employment, and, of course, a system to finance development that 
does not exist in our country." [sentence as published] 
  The PRD economic proposal, the party leader said, wants to 
become a historic program because it is designed to transform a 
political and economic system that will only have true meaning 
if the country's political system is changed through a new 
alignment of forces. 
  There is no economic model in history that is not based on a 
new alignment of political forces because "a true political 
program calls for change and a renewal of a thesis and a plan 
based on emerging political forces." 
  Munoz Ledo added that the PRD program calls for the 
abolition 
of the authoritarian system, a return of power to the citizens, 
the implementation of a true federalist system, a division of 
power, and control by the people's representatives of the 
leaders and of public spending. 
  It also calls for the establishment of municipal autonomy; 
dissolution of the corporate system; freedom for economic 
players; and the elimination of pacts, authoritarianism, 
centralism, and the system based on large estates 
[patrimonialismo]. "This is a political program to eliminate 
the state party system," he added. 
  The forum is intended to fine-tune and enrich the party's 
economic proposal. There will be two sessions. One took place 
yesterday and the other will be held on 20 June. About 20 PRD 
economists and others who have ties to the party will 
participate. 
  Among the issues mentioned in the economic proposal are 
industrial development, foreign trade, social policies to create 
jobs and raise salaries, and a broad industrialization strategy 
that calls for restructuring fiscal policy to encourage 
investments and reduce inflation through increased production of 
goods and services to achieve a more equitable distribution of 
wealth. 
  A primary element of this strategy is the promotion of a 
clear-cut renegotiation of the foreign debt with the 
international financial community and the struggle against the 
country's foreign debt. 
  Another major element is the renegotiation of all clauses in 
the NAFTA accord that affect national development, while 
immediately exempting basic grains from this agreement and 
maintaining the state's autonomous power to establish tariffs, 
issue import permits, subsidies, and development policies to 
achieve self-sufficiency in food. The pact also needs to be 
renegotiated to neutralize the control the United States has 
over Mexican agricultural markets. 
  The program also calls for an adjustment of subsidies on 
exports for national agricultural producers to match those in 
the United States, as well as the including in NAFTA the issue 
of labor mobility to balance out differences in labor conditions 
and thereby stop the export of underpriced labor from Mexico. 
  It does not abandon the original PRD proposal to promote a 
Continental Agreement for Development, Employment, and Trade 
that recognizes differences between the countries in Latin 
America and the Caribbean and those in North America. 
  The program stresses the need to hold national discussions 
on 
important international agreements through referendums prior to 
their approval or rejection by Congress. 
  The PRD program seeks to hike minimum wages to guarantee 
goods, health, and housing to workers, and with this in mind, it 
proposes the elimination of the National Commission on Minimum 
Wages to allow the Congress of the Union to determine, in 
agreement with unions and employers, bases for and means of 
establishing minimum wages. This implies "eliminating arbitrary 
government meddling in salaries established by contract." 
  It proposes a review of the effects of the tax structure on 
small businesses, medium-size companies, and on middle and 
low-income classes, as well as a review of the distribution of 
fiscal obligations among federal, state, and municipal 
authorities in an effort to devise a fair tax system. 
  The PRD proposal also calls for the elimination of the 
2-percent tax on company assets. It calls for a tax policy 
based on the principles of equity and the promotion of 
productive activities. In this regard, it calls for the 
presentation of a multiannual budget of public revenues and 
expenditures and the elimination of the uncertainty created by 
the so-called miscellaneous tax matter category. 
  It also proposes the gradual reduction of taxes levied on 
the 
large profits of Mexican Petroleum and the rechannelling of such 
funds mainly into the development of the national petrochemical 
industry.

    [Editorial report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Mexican economic developments monitored through 21 
June. 
  The Finance and Public Credit Secretariat has authorized the 
Mexican Association of Banks to extend a line of credit of up to 
2 billion pesos to conclude a restructuring program of expired 
loans. Most of these loans are for the agriculture sector. 
(Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 16 June 94 p 
21A) 
  The agriculture and hydraulic resources (SARH) secretary has 
said the marketing system is the Achilles heel preventing 
Mexican producers access to international markets. The 
secretary has offered SARH support to Yucatan Peninsula 
producers of rice, chile peppers, sugarcane, and citrus fruits 
to cover not only local demands but also export goals. (Mexico 
City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 17 June 94 pp 1, 5) 
  The Mexican Bank of Foreign Trade has granted $222.1 million 
to the southeastern part of the country from January to May, 40 
percent more than during the same period in 1993, Alberto Rio, 
promotion manager for that area, has reported. The sectors that 
benefited in the five states -- Yucatan, Quintana Roo, Chiapas, 
Tabasco, and Campeche -- were primarily agriculture, tourism, 
fishing, and manufacturing. (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 
1957 GMT 18 June 94) 
  Approximately 50,000 producers owe $16 billion to the 
Mexican 
banking system, and given the impossibility of recovering the 
investment, the Mexican Banking Association has offered a 
renegotiation aimed at financing the development of the nation. 
The problems started in July 1993 due to the economic recession 
and uncontrolled growth in loans granted without guarantees that 
were aimed at reactivating economic growth in the past five 
years. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1408 GMT 18 June 94) 
  According to the National Banking Commission, Mexican 
banking 
systems revenues dropped 14.1 percent during the first quarter 
compared to the same period in 1993, the result of a reduced 
volume of business, bad loans, a fall in the exchange rate, and 
an increase in interest rates. Nevertheless, it was stated that 
for the remainder of the year, this trend could be reversed due 
to the government's monetary policy. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 
1426 GMT 18 June 94) 
  Yesterday, peasant organizations stated the failure of the 
agricultural policy during the current six-year period has 
resulted in a 19-percent decrease in basic grain production, the 
unemployment of 2 million peasants, and an annual loss of 13 
billion pesos by producers. The organizations stated the 
compensatory measures the executive has announced will not make 
up for losses in past years registering in the millions

15A)

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper met with Prosecutor 
General Gustavo de Greiff and President Gaviria today. 
Meanwhile, Conservative candidate Andres Pastrana has called a 
news conference for tomorrow. 
  The contacts to finance the political campaigns were made 
between 7 and 11 June, a few days before the runoff elections. 
In the recordings, journalist Alberto Giraldo talks with Miguel 
Rodriguez Orejuela [Cali Cartel leader] and tells him about the 
need for funds to cover expenses at the end of the campaigns. 
They mention 5 billion pesos. Here are excerpts of three of 
the six recordings. The others cannot be disclosed for legal 
reasons. 
  [Begin recording] [Giraldo] The man urgently needs money. 
  [Rodriguez] Who is the man? Eduardo? 
  [Giraldo] Yes, he asked me to act as emissary. 
  [Rodriguez] Fine. 
  [Giraldo] Yes, yes. 
  [Rodriguez] Is he the same one I know? 
  [Giraldo] Yes, yes, yes. 
  [Rodriguez] There are a few little problems here. 
  [Giraldo] Oh? 
  [Rodriguez] Because they want everything, everything, 
everything, everything, everything, everything. There are five 
points there that are basic commands, right? 
  [Giraldo] Yes. 
  [Rodriguez] Another thing... 
  [Giraldo, interrupting] How do you see things in the [word 
indistinct]? 
  [Rodriguez] I am in your hands. It sounds funny, doesn't it? 
  [Giraldo] Then why is Medina saying that Santo Domingo or 
whatever they want to give him? 
  [Rodriguez] No [words indistinct] 
  [Giraldo] That is what he told us that day. I heard him, but 
his saint wants the same length and width. They have a limit 
and [words indistinct] the truth is they need 5 billion. They 
already have 2 billion; they need 3 billion more. 
  [Rodriguez] Oh. 
  [Giraldo] They are there. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes? 
  [Giraldo] Yes [words indistinct]. [end recording] 
  After confirming that they were there, Giraldo tells 
Rodriguez Orejuela in another conversation that he is upset 
about articles in LA PRENSA that mentioned him as spokesman of 
the Cali Cartel. Rodriguez Orejuela then tells him not to worry 
as the other campaign had reportedly received $2.5 million from 
the so-called Northern Valle Cartel. 
  The recordings also mention money presumably received by 
General Miguel Maza Marquez. 
  [Begin recording] [Giraldo] I talked to Maza. 
  [Rodriguez] Yes? 
  [Giraldo] He [words indistinct] after what I told him, but I 
hope he gives it to me in cash. 
  [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] 
  [Giraldo] I hope he gives it to me in cash, to deliver it 
tomorrow. 
  [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] 
  [Giraldo] Good. Okay. [end recording] 
  The two people speaking mentioned a Pastrana supporter in 
the 
coffee producing areas. Before starting the second 
conversation, one of them warns the other of the risk that their 
call could be intercepted, to which the other replies: Do not 
worry, brother, these phones are safe.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper's campaign has just 
issued a communique regarding the contents of an audio cassette. 
On the tape, a well known Bogota journalist speaks to an 
alleged Cali Cartel leader. The conversation speaks of possible 
campaign contributions. Part of the communique says: 
  1. The President-elect talked today with the prosecutor 
general to request a swift and efficient investigation of the 
facts. Samper gave the prosecuter general's office his campaign 
accounting books for a thorough examination. 
  2. From the very beginning of the presidential campaign, we 
warned of the danger of drug trafficking money filtering into 
the political process. In response to this, a Code of Ethics 
was issued. This Code of Ethics contains a full chapter on 
controlling the source of campaign funding and it appoints an 
ethical prosecutor. 
  Former presidential candidate Andres Pastrana will address 
this controversial issue during a press conference tomorrow.

  [Text] President-elect Ernesto Samper has flatly denied his 
campaign received any money of doubtful origin and placed his 
accounting books at the disposal of the Prosecutor General's 
Office. 
  [Begin unidentified reporter recording] 1. The 
president-elect talked today with the prosecutor general to 
request a swift and efficient investigation of the facts. He 
placed the campaign books at the disposal of that office to be 
thoroughly reviewed. 
  2. From the very start of the campaign, we warned of the 
danger of the infiltration of drug trafficking money into 
politics and that is why an ethics code was issued, which 
devotes a special chapter on controlling the origin of resources 
for the campaign, and an ethics prosecutor of the highest moral 
qualities was named to enforce the code and prevent this 
infiltration. No other campaign, therefore, had greater control 
or was stricter in receiving resources than ours. As a result 
of this strict control, we can categorically affirm today that 
our campaign treasury received no money of doubtful origin. 
  3. Any Colombian citizen or news media wishing to review the 
campaign books may do so from this moment and corroborate, as 
the overseer of the national Treasury did, the origin of 
donations received this past year. 
  4. The president-elect has once again reiterated his 
unyielding commitment to fighting drug trafficking, combating it 
decisively in the military field but without repealing the 
policy of surrendering to justice promoted by the current 
government. By the same token, he will maintain all 
international commitments to cooperate in fighting this scourge. 
Not one millimeter will be yielded to this crime, and the 
international community will be asked to take clearer 
responsibility to persecute money laundering and consumption in 
developed nations. 
  5. The president-elect appeals for peace so situations such 
as this one are not used lightly as political weapons that harm 
Colombia's image abroad. [end recording]

<F P=106> [News conference by President-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano at </F>
Narino Palace in Santa Fe de Bogota on 21 June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Samper] The truth is that if the campaign is 
investigated, it will be because we have requested it. We were 
officially notified of the cassette during the latter part of 
last week when it was officially given to us at the [words 
indistinct]. At the time, we were also told that it had been 
given to the president of the Republic. This cassette contains 
very serious accusations against both campaigns; Dr. Andres 
Pastrana's campaign as well as ours. I am adamant about having 
this matter so thoroughly cleared up that we may know exactly 
which representatives of Dr. Pastrana's campaign and my 
campaign, were apparently involved in using drug trafficking 
money during the past presidential elections. 
  I will accept the results of the investigations that must be 
made by the Prosecutor General, and if anyone who worked for my 
campaign, is proven to have been involved -- as the cassette 
indicates -- in this incident, they will be withdrawn from my 
government and they will not participate in my administration, 
regardless of the legal penalties that may be imposed on them. 
  Thus, I believe, this case has to be totally clarified. I, 
as President, assure Colombians that this procedure will allow 
us to know the truth regarding the events described in the 
cassette, which was revealed yesterday and which involves my and 
Dr. Pastrana's campaign. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Initially, it was said [words 
indistinct] because there was information that drug trafficking 
money was being used in politics. Does this have anything to do 
with this latest incident? 
  [Samper] Maribel, the code of ethics was really implemented 
rigorously throughout. Today, I obtained the information I had 
requested on the campaign and it allows me to reiterate, as I 
said yesterday, that money of doubtful origin has not been used 
in my campaign. I want to invite any Colombian or media source, 
who cares to do so, to conduct a thorough examination of my 
campaign's accounting books. I made this commitment and I 
maintained it to the end. Likewise, the ethical prosecutor 
studied the origin of all the resources used in my campaign. 
That is why I am absolutely at ease and I want to express my 
total tranquility to Colombians. No drug trafficking resources 
were used in my campaign and the Prosecutor General will also be 
able to assess this in the books we presented to him today for 
his scrutiny. 
  [Reporter] Good evening, Dr. Samper. You said the tape was 
officially delivered to you. Were you informed at that time who 
the people in this recording were? 
  [Samper] No. We simply received the tape. We were told it 
contained accusations against both campaigns and that the 
government wanted us to know about it. After viewing the tape, 
we issued a first declaration rejecting the statements made in 
the tape. Second, I met with the prosecutor general today for 
over three hours and, as president-elect, officially requested 
this investigation. It is in the best interests of the former 
Samper and Pastrana campaigns and of democracy that this issue 
be clarified. I repeat: I will abide by the results of the 
prosecutor general's investigation. 
  If that investigation reveals that people from my campaign 
are involved in the events described on the tape, I am willing 
to remove them from the campaign team. They will not join the 
government and will be subject to the appropriate penalties. 
  [Reporter] Dr. Samper, considering that microphones were 
found at your home and campaign headquarters, do you think this 
could be a campaign against you? What do you think is the 
origin of this [word indistinct]? 
  [Samper] I do not know. Based on what has been said by the 
people who conducted the preliminary investigation, I think the 
tape is authentic. I hope it is not part of a plot against me 
because that would have the effect not of discrediting Ernesto 
Samper but of undermining democracy. I want to reiterate to all 
Colombians that we have paid a high price in blood over the last 
10 years to move our country ahead and defeat narcoterrorism. I 
was personally a victim of narcoterrorism. That gives me the 
moral authority to tell Colombians that we will continue to work 
at home and abroad to let the world know we are not the 
perpetrator but the main victim of drug trafficking. 
  [Reporter] Good evening, Dr. Samper. There is a recording 
linking your campaign to drug money. How can you justify this 
incident? What is your opinion? How will this affect national 
and international public opinion, considering that you were just 
elected president on Sunday? 
  [Samper] As I have said, this tape implicates the two 
campaign groups of the recent presidential campaign. I think 
the mere act of sowing doubt adversely affects the country. It 
affects the country's image abroad. I am therefore committed to 
clarifying this matter, not only as Ernesto Samper, former 
presidential candidate -- I assume this commitment because I 
must defend the integrity of my campaign, as I have reiterated 
over the past year -- but also as president of Colombia so this 
issue will not affect Colombia's long struggle against drug 
trafficking. This evening, I reaffirm my commitment to continue 
fighting drug trafficking in all its forms. I also wish to 
reaffirm this commitment so Colombia's international image will 
not be affected. 
  I emphatically reject the charges. It is disturbing to think 
that these incidents could become a regular thing, as is thought 
by people in some parts of the world where they believe all 
Colombians are drug traffickers. I reject this assertion and 
the insinuations in the tape, in which two people are holding a 
dialogue apart from any campaign. This dialogue ultimately 
affects the two main candidates in the recent election.

  [Text] Tonight, the Ministry of Defense issued a communique 
detailing the information the government received on the 
recordings. At approximately 1730 on Thursday, 16 June, Dr. 
Andres Pastrana and Dr. Luis Alberto Moreno paid a visit to the 
president and minister of defense and presented them with a tape 
containing three telephone conversations. The first two 
conversations were allegedly between journalist Alberto Giraldo 
and Mr. Miguel Orejuela and the third conversation was between 
Giraldo and Mr. Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela. 
  Dr. Pastrana said he received the tape in the city of Cali, 
the day before from people who did not identify themselves. 
Early on 17 June, the minister of defense, at the request of 
the president of the Republic, ordered the military forces 
general command and the police general directorate to confirm 
the veracity of voices and forward, as soon as possible, the 
tape and results of voice confirmation to the Prosecutor 
General's Office. The same order was given to the DAS 
[Administrative Department of Security] director. 
  After informing the prosecutor general, that same 17 June, 
Dr. Ernesto Samper Pizano was informed about this situation and 
a copy of the tape was forwarded to him. At about 1630 on 17 
June, at the request of the defense minister, three Armed Forces 
commanders delivered the recording personally to the prosecutor 
general. The results of the confirmation of voices were 
forwarded first on Friday and then on Saturday. 
  Taking into consideration that this investigation falls 
under 
the Prosecutor General's Office, the government immediately 
forwarded the tapes and the voice confirmation to that agency. 
Additionally and as is routine, the government and Armed Forces 
are ready to assist the Prosecutor General's Office in all 
support needed in this case.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Jun (EFE) -- The Colombian 
Prosecutor General's office announced today it is conducting 
investigations of the telephone tapping discovered in the office 
of Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper. 
  This organization received "a microphone for transmitting 
conversations and a wiretapping device," which were found on 9 
June, from Samper's campaign office. "The Prosecutor General's 
Office is conducting the investigations and technical tests 
required to establish the criminal action and responsible 
parties," Ana Lucia Obregon of the Press and Information Office 
announced. 
  The Colombian "Watergate" gave rise to a serious controversy 
on Thursday when Horacio Serpa Uribe, one of the members of 
Samper's presidential campaign, accused "the Pastranistas" 
(reference to supporters of Conservative Party presidential 
candidate Andres Pastrana Arango) of being responsible. 
  The reaction of Pastrana and members of his electoral 
campaign followed. They accused Serpa Uribe of "slander" and of 
using the strategy of "lies in view of their fear of the support 
received by the Conservative Party candidate" throughout the 
country. "They are inventing many things out of fear," a member 
of Pastrana's electoral campaign stated. 
  Fernando Botero Zea, chief of Samper's electoral campaign, 
reiterated that "only the Prosecutor General's Office can 
determine who the spies are," emphasizing that "we do not have 
any evidence." According to Botero Zea, the police released a 
report to Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff, "giving a 
detailed account of how the incident took place." 
  Political circles of the two parties are hoping the results 
of the investigation by the Prosecutor General's Office will 
conclude before this coming Sunday's elections when Samper and 
Pastrana will face one another in the runoff elections for the 
Colombian Presidency. 
  The National Civil Registry Office, charged with organizing 
the elections, reported today that it distributed 18 million 
voting cards throughout the country and that 72 hours before the 
elections, which will take place between 0800 and 1600 (1300 and 
2100 GMT), "everything is perfectly controlled."

  [Text] Domestic air travel has been complicated by a pilots 
strike. A total of 85 percent of domestic operations have been 
suspended and the economic effects of the strike are already 
being felt. 
  Here is Jaime Garcia, chief of operations at the El Dorado 
International Airport in Santa Fe de Bogota, on the emergency 
plan that is being implemented today in the nation's airports. 
  [Begin Garcia recording] The emergency plan in the airports 
is being implemented by some airlines that are cooperating to 
enable passengers to reach their destinations. The domestic 
airlines cooperating are Intercontinental de Aviacion and Islena 
de Aviacion, Satena, and there are a few Aires flights. [end 
recording] 
  Intercontinental de Aviacion today covered its normal 
routes, 
that is, from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Popayan, Barranquilla, 
and San Andres, among others, for a total of 19 daily flights. 
Likewise, there are 19 other flights from other cities to Santa 
Fe de Bogota. Islena de Aviacion is operating special routes 
from Santa Fe de Bogota to Cali, Medellin, and San Andres. 
  Nevertheless, 80 percent of the nation's passengers travel 
on 
Avianca, and this company does not have agreements for the 
transfer of passengers. Therefore, if you have an Avianca 
ticket and decide to travel on another airline, you will most 
likely have to purchase a new ticket. Meanwhile, Ases and 
Avianca announced they have hired foreign pilots to fly their 
international routes.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 21 June 1994. 
  National Administrative Department of Statistics, DANE, 
preliminary figures report the agricultural sector grew 2.7 
percent in 1993, less than the government estimate of a 
3-percent increase. Factors affecting the sector were a decrease 
in the harvest and the effects of the dry spell in some areas, 
which prompted uncertainty among the farmers. The sector, 
however, showed a slight recovery over 1992, when a 1.65-percent 
increase was recorded. The government estimates more favorable 
growth in 1994 because of the price increase in international 
markets of coffee, cotton, sugar, and rice. According to DANE, 
the total economy grew 5.3 percent in 1993. Sectors that helped 
achieve this increase were electric power, construction, and 
financial services. The construction sector grew 7 percent; 
trade 5 percent; and transportation and communications 4 
percent. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 pp 
8B, 9B) 
  The privatization of Banco Cafetero has begun in earnest. On 
15 June, the bank offered a package of shares worth 57.623 
billion pesos to the National Federation of Colombian Coffee 
Growers, Fedecafe, producers, exporters, and other businesses in 
the sector. A total of 10,686,827 shares will be sold to 
increase the bank's authorized capital. This is part of an 
agreement reached between the government and the association to 
sell 50.5 percent of Banco Cafetero; the remaining 49.5 percent 
will remain in the hands of Fedecafe. The bank's value was set 
at 230 billion pesos. 
  Of this shares issue, Fedecafe will buy 40.338 billion pesos 
in shares, the producers, exporters, and other businesses in the 
sector will buy another 17.288 billion pesos in shares, and the 
remainder, 96.042 billion pesos will be offered to a foreign 
bank. The shares will be offered at 5.392 pesos per share. The 
deadline for purchasing shares will be one year after the 
publishing of the sale of shares. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO 
in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 8B) 
  The most recent report issued by the Latin America 
Integration Association, Aladi, shows that total exports for 
member nations reached $122.5 billion in 1993, a 6 percent 
increase over 1992. Imports grew at a slower rate reaching 
$135.2 billion, which helped to reduce the traditional trade 
deficit of Latin American nations. Interregional exports reached 
$23.5 billion for an increase of 21 percent, while imports 
reached $22.741 billion. Brazil led Aladi nations with exports 
of $9.145 billion, followed by Argentina with $5.262 billion, 
and Chile with $1.798 billion. Colombian exports to other Aladi 
nations was $1.439 billion, $124 million more than in 1992. 
Colombian imports from Aladi reached $2.321 billion. (Santa Fe 
de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 12A) 
  The National Association of Industrialists, on 17 June, 
reported industrial production increased 8.5 percent during the 
first four months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. 
This surpassed the government's estimate of a 4- to 4.5-percent 
increase. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1856 GMT 17 Jun 94)

  [Text] Lima, 20 Jun (EFE) -- On 20 June, Peruvian President 
Alberto Fujimori reported that Abimael Guzman's arrest was 
possible thanks to the report given by a Shining Path [SL] 
leader who betrayed his leaders in exchange of his freedom. The 
president released some unprecedented details on the Shining 
Path leader's arrest, explaining the release of Luis Alberto 
Arana Franco, which has prompted a scandal in Peru. 
  Fujimori said Arana Franco, logistics chief for the Maoist 
group, was released in compliance with the Repentance Law 
approved in August 1992 because he provided some clues to police 
that led to Guzman's arrest in September the same year. Arana 
was arrested in June 1992 and two months later, when the law was 
approved, he decided to seek refuge under the law, which reduces 
the sentence of a terrorist who cooperates in capturing the 
heads of his organization. 
  The Peruvian president reported that Arana Franco betrayed 
Zenon Vargas, Shining Path national coordinator, and Maritza 
Garrido-Lecca, and Juan Inchaustegui, who were in charge of 
Guzman's personal safety. 
  After following Garrido-Lecca and Inchaustegui, police 
concluded that the couple was hiding an "important" Shining Path 
leader in their home, and raided the house without imagining 
that the top leader could be found inside. 
  Fujimori said that Arana Franco's decision "must serve as an 
example for those who want to reorganize their lives instead of 
earning a long prison sentence," and added that the released 
collaborator is being protected and his identity has been 
changed. 
  The Peruvian president also confirmed that in the past two 
months, the Peruvian courts have released several Shining Path 
terrorists "for lack of evidence" and asked the Supreme Court to 
"thoroughly" investigate these cases. 
  He also categorically rejected reports that his government 
has released some terrorists as a result of negotiations with 
arrested Shining Path leaders, and said such rumors "are in bad 
faith and biased." 
  The political opposition has said it will ask Congress to 
call the justice and defense ministers to explain why those 
Shining Path terrorists were released. 
  Most government officials have reported, however, that the 
petition will be rejected because it intends to "politicize" the 
problem and to blame the government for those cases "that are 
the exclusive responsibility of the courts."

  [Excerpts] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Peruvian Police 
reported that a Shining Path [SL] leader, who was arrested last 
week, was trying to reactivate a logistics support organization 
for SL commandos with funds derived from drug trafficking. 
  SL Leader Moises Simon Limaco, also known as "Ramiro," is 
believed to be the right-hand man of Oscar Ramirez Durand 
("Felicano"). Durand is the new SL leader, who is also striving 
to reactivate the weakened terrorist gang. 
  Limaco planned to reactive the People's Aid of Peru force, 
an 
organization headed by lawyer Martha Huatay who has been 
sentenced to life imprisonment. This organization supplied 
clothing, food, shelter, and medical attention for SL commandos. 
  The police have indicated that the reactivation of the 
People's Aid of Peru was financed with funds Limaco obtained 
from traffickers in the northern Peruvian jungle region where SL 
offers protection to traffickers in exchange for money and guns. 
  Limaco was arrested on 17 June in the northern part of Lima. 
The same sources added that his questioning proceedings, which 
began yesterday, comprises about 100 questions drafted by the 
police antiterrorist squad. [passage omitted] 
  It was also reported today that 18 SL members were arrested 
in Ayacucho department, in the southern Andean region. The 
sources added that among them is Ercilia Prado (also known as 
"Maria"), who has been a SL member since 1981 and who was in 
jail for seven years. She is believed to be the liaison between 
"Feliciano" and the Ayacucho branch of the SL.

  [Text] Lima, 20 Jun (EFE) -- According to the Apoyo polling 
firm, Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori enjoys the support of 
45 percent of Peruvians while former UN Secretary General Javier 
Perez de Cuellar, who still has not decided whether to run in 
the 1995 elections, has only 25 percent. 
  The poll results disclosed on 19 June during a political 
television program also mention that Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, 
who already has launched his candidacy, enjoys 11 percent 
support. 
  According to the same source, former President Fernando 
Belaunde has the support of 4 percent; former Senator Javier 
Balle Riestra, 3 percent; and former Mayor Luis Caceres 
Velazquez, 1 percent. 
  In the case of a second round of elections between Fujimori 
and Perez de Cuellar, Fujimori would get 49 percent and Perez de 
Cuellar 37 percent. 
  If the second round were to pit Fujimori against Belmont, 
the 
results would be 55 percent for Fujimori and 27 percent for 
Belmont, according to the results of this early poll.

<F P=106> [Interview with General Jose Nadal Payva, Peruvian Air Force </F>
commander, by unidentified reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Text] [EXPRESO] Gen. Nadal, could you tell us how the FAP 
participates in drug enforcement actions? 
  [Nadal] The FAP has been carrying out joint operations with 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] since 1985, seeking to 
neutralize drug trafficking activities in Peru. 
  In 1981, we verified that traffickers and terrorists had 
formed an alliance. The FAP then began to operate from the Santa 
Lucia Base because illegal activities like that threaten 
national security. 
  Through Decree Law No. 25426 of 10 April 1991 and Decree Law 
No. 042-DE/FAP of 16 June 1992, the FAP was legally empowered to 
control all landing strips in Huallaga and other places where 
coca is grown. The FAP is thus responsible for destroying 
clandestine landing strips and for downing planes intercepted in 
Peruvian air space that refuse to obey orders to land. 
  To carry out its mission, the FAP uses its A-37, T-27, Y-12, 
and T-41 planes as well as gunships that can operate day and 
night. 
  [EXPRESO] What are the results of these operations? 
  [Nadal] Since 1991 the FAP has spotted, intercepted, 
captured 
and/or destroyed about 200 Peruvian and foreign aircraft that 
have violated the Civil Aviation Law and/or engaged in 
trafficking. More than $1.2 billion resulting from drug 
trafficking and 3.6 tonnes of cocaine paste have also been 
seized. 
  The FAP, the Peruvian Army, and the PNP have destroyed 
clandestine landing strips and cocaine paste laboratories in 
various areas including Caballococha and Puerto Maldonado. It 
should also be mentioned that more than 7,000 flight hours have 
been invested in enforcement operations. Considering our 
limitations, the balance of our participation is encouraging and 
positive, not just because of our achievements but also because 
of the high morale of our troops. 
  [EXPRESO] What contribution is the FAP making to the current 
pacification process regarding the civic actions and social aide 
in general? 
  [Nadal] The FAP has stepped up its participation, as far as 
civic actions and social aide is concerned, through the 
following activities: Granting free medical attention in 
clinical medicine, odontology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, 
pediatrics, gynecology, urology, cardiology, traumatology, 
pneumology, and various types of surgery, as well as medical 
evacuations, distribution of medicines, massive vaccination, and 
providing air transportation for civil personnel in emergency 
cases in outlying towns where the FAP has personnel stationed. 
  During this year the FAP has performed some 710 flight hours 
transporting to and from the interior approximately 15,500 
people and 100,000 kg of foodstuffs, clothing, equipment, and 
machinery necessary for the national pacification process in 
which the national government is engaged. 
  Moreover, we have organized and implemented youth clubs 
called "Los Aguiluchos" [Little Eagles] that involve 
approximately 1,500 children between six and 12 years of age who 
receive clothing, civilian-patriotic teachings, talks on the 
prevention of drug addiction and infectious diseases, remedial 
courses, sports, handicraft, and recreation. 
  This social assistance also reaches the parents with 
periodic 
conferences on subjects like "Responsible Parenthood" and "Child 
Psychology." The FAP also facilitates communication free of 
charge for local inhabitants at certain hours of the day. 
  [EXPRESO] You headed the Peruvian delegation to the latest 
International Air Fair in Chile. How does our FAP compared with 
the technological and scientific developments displayed there? 
  [Nadal] The fair was visited by more than 900,000 spectators 
where 31 countries exhibited their goods. The FAP used the 
opportunity to create a landmark in its relationship with the 
sister Latin American Air Forces by reasserting the well-known 
professional level of its personnel through a presentation, 
which was described as excellent both from the operative as well 
as technical viewpoint, operating 2,000 aircraft and state of 
the art technology. 
  The FAP Aircraft Maintenance Service (Seman) has proven that 
it is able to deal with high technology and that it provides FAP 
planes with excellent service. This can also be applied to other 
types of Peruvian or foreign aircraft.

<F P=106> [Interview with Daniel Espichan Tumay, special prosecutor </F>
for terrorist crimes by "L.C.R.;" place and date not given] 
  [Text] [L.C.R.] Mr. Espichan, you have been involved in the 
permanent struggle against subversion for many years. We now 
seem to be at the threshold of a pacification. What can you tell 
us about this? 
  [Espichan] I do not want to sound over-optimistic, but just 
looking at the statistics I can say we have achieved 97 percent 
progress in our struggle against the Shining Path [SL] and 99 
percent regarding the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The 
key of this struggle, of course, was President Alberto 
Fujimori's decision to begin political and administrative 
changes and, at the same time, conduct the struggle against 
terrorism from the head of his government. History will confirm 
that there was a time before and after President Fujimori made 
his political decision. 
  [L.C.R] I believe every government over the past 14 years 
has 
made a contribution. 
  [Espichan] Everything failed during the 1980-90 period. Laws 
were issued that were contradictory from the legal viewpoint. 
These laws were full of mistakes that prevented us from 
confronting the terrorists and punishing them adequately. After 
that came the political decision, that is, on 5 April and, 
especially, after 6 May 1992 with three important resolutions: 
Decree Law No. 25475 issued on 6 May 1992, Decree Law No. 25499, 
the "Repentance Law," that was issued just six days later on 12 
May 1992, and Decree Law No. 25659, the "Treason Against the 
Fatherland Law" which legally specifies terrorism and allows 
this crime to be tried by military courts. 
  [L.C.R] Some people believe these decrees are too harsh and 
that, consequently, they could have a boomerang effect. 
  [Espichan] These legal measures, especially Decree Laws Nos. 
25475 and 25659 are harsh, but they are what the citizenry 
demanded because terrorism had already reached Lima. In 1991, it 
felt almost as if we were being defeated by the SL and somebody 
had to do something about it and say: Stop, either democracy 
prevails or we let terrorism take over the country. The final 
decision was taken by the president when he implemented the 
structural, political, and administrative changes in our country 
on 5 April. 
  [L.C.R.] President Fujimori obviously enjoyed the Armed 
Forces' support at that time. 
  [Espichan] What is quite obvious now is that the Armed 
Forces 
are playing a very significant role. If this had not been the 
case, we would not be heading toward a true pacification. We 
must mention the brilliant and intelligent performance of a 
brave man who not only sits behind his desk giving his Army 
orders at a nationwide level, but personally goes to the theater 
of operations to give orders and find out what is going on. I am 
talking about Army General Nicolas de Bari Hermoza Rios, a 
brilliant military officer who must be paid the highest 
compliments for his success as the representative of the Armed 
Forces. 
  [L.C.R.] What about the civilians, have they also responded 
to this struggle? 
  [Espichan] The citizenry is another component in this 
struggle. The citizens' brave, heroic attitude makes them even 
more worthy, considering the suffering they endure. Despite the 
poverty in which we live as a result of terrorism, the low 
salaries, and the many shortcomings, the citizenry has lost its 
fear of terrorism. 
  [L.C.R.] Also in Ayacucho? 
  [Espichan] In Ayacucho and other Andean regions that were 
severely tormented by terrorism, the people rejoice over the 
peace they now enjoy. Of course others rejoice over being able 
to return to their home towns, being able to pick up their 
abandoned businesses, being able to peacefully walk the streets. 
  [L.C.R.] Many assert that terrorism is not yet fully 
defeated. 
  [Espichan] That is true. Terrorism has yet to be defeated. I 
am realistic and admit there are still a few fanatics, 
psychopaths, but they will not succeed in Peru. There have been 
many changes, especially regarding the causes that gave origin 
to terrorism. Peru is a different country today, both 
domestically and internationally. This is why I repeatedly tell 
every terrorist to repent now that they are defeated and return 
to their families who need them. 
  [L.C.R.] The leaders greatly influence them. 
  [Espichan] No way. I believe terrorists have already 
realized 
that the while they give their lives for mistaken causes, the 
leadership gets drunk on fine wines and lives in residences that 
only wealthy people can afford, that they only struggle in 
theory and deceive their followers. This is why so many 
repentant terrorists have surrendered and rejoined society, the 
fatherland.

<F P=106> [Article by Sao Paulo "special correspondent" Luis Ocampo </F>
Alonso] 
  [Text] The seizure of the largest shipment of cocaine ever 
confiscated in Latin America (7.5 metric tons) at Alborada 
ranch, located in Tocantins, western Brazil, at the beginning of 
June and the arrest of 14 drug traffickers linked to the Cali 
Cartel enabled the U.S. DEA and Brazilian Federal Police to 
discover one of the leading money laundering networks operating 
in the Western Hemisphere. 
  Address books and computer diskettes the aforementioned drug 
traffickers had in their possession were instrumental in 
establishing that the drug money route started in the United 
States (New York) and Colombia and joined up in Ciudad del Este 
in bank accounts at a branch of the Bank of The Netherlands. The 
holder of these accounts is Nasrat Mohamad Jamil Rassoul, a 
well-known "border manager" of Lebanese extraction who owns real 
estate and businesses in Ciudad del Este--the capital of Alto 
Parana Department--and Foz do Iguacu. From Ciudad del Este, the 
dollars were transferred through several operations to another 
account that Rassoul himself had at the Bamerindus Bank in Foz 
do Iguacu. From there the money was once again transferred to 
Bank of Brazil agencies located in different Brazilian cities to 
several account holders, many of whom were fictitious. 
  Brazilian and U.S. investigators asserted that all the 
financial resources used by the gang busted in Tocantins to 
purchase the aforementioned ranch, several aircraft, motor 
boats, cars, and even to set up at least three companies that 
would act as a front for their activities came to Brazil via 
Ciudad del Este. This means that movements in Rassoul's accounts 
amounted to more than $1 million in approximately 10 months. 
Rassoul was seconded in his dealings by fellow countryman David 
Haddad (both are currently held in custody in Brasilia). The 
amount of money movement has led the DEA to suspect that some 
Paraguayan regional or national "high-ranking authority" might 
have facilitated the establishment and operations of the Cali 
Cartel in Ciudad del Este. 
  Another detail that has caught the attention of DEA and 
Brazilian drug enforcement agents is the involvement of Samia 
Haddock Lobo, a Brazilian businesswoman (at present a fugitive 
from justice) in the dismantled drug gang. Haddock Lobo is a 
member of a very respectable Rio de Janeiro family that 
allegedly has properties and investments in Paraguay. Antonio 
Mota Graca, the entrepreneur's husband, escaped from a Sao Paulo 
prison approximately two years ago. He was in prison on drug 
trafficking charges. Brazilian Federal Police sources think Mota 
Graca is hiding somewhere in Paraguay. 
  If all this was not enough, Brazilian journalists following 
the Tocantins case told NOTICIAS that one of the passports used 
by arrested Colombian citizen Vicente Rivera Ramos, son of one 
of the Medellin Cartel's big shots, was stamped several times by 
our country's immigration authorities, indicating that his trips 
between Colombia, Brazil, and Paraguay were frequent. It is not 
too credible to maintain that the international drug trafficking 
"big shot" visited our country frequently simply because he was 
attracted by the beauty of our women or the sweetness of our 
polkas and guaranias [national folk music]. 
  Central Bank, Federal Revenue Office (the central tax 
collection organization), and Federal Police authorities in the 
neighboring country are concerned with the volume of drug 
trafficking operations in Brazil, and in the next few days will 
start a large joint operation to exchange information, trying to 
detect any money laundering scheme used in the country. No one 
doubts that the U.S. DEA will follow the Brazilian antinarcotics 
operation very closely and that one of the study's main targets 
will be precisely the Ciudad del Este-Foz do Iguacu axis.

  [Text] Integration Deputy Minister Ruben Fadlala has said: 
"Paraguay is in the most sensitive and difficult situation 
within Mercosur [Common Market of the South], because it must 
adapt itself to play a significant role in the regional market." 
Fadlala attended the most recent Mercosur meeting--held in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina--with his colleagues of the other 
signatory countries. 
  Fadlala said this was a very difficult meeting because of 
the 
various aspects, the short time available, and the deadlines 
that are about to expire. 
  He said: "We have outlined our position and want it 
considered in order to achieve what we are looking for, that is, 
an expanded market with coordination and harmony in various 
subjects." 
  He added that this will turn Mercosur into an expanded 
market--rather than a free-trade zone--in which we can implement 
at least an initial common market. 
  As for the products over which there are tariff 
disagreements, Fadlala said not all points have been raised in 
connection with the products on which it is not possible to 
adopt a single tariff. "This will be done at the last technical 
meeting of subgroup 10, scheduled for the end of the month. The 
matter will be later addressed at the political level, when 
deputy ministers will choose the exceptions," he said. The 
deputy ministers' meeting might be held early in July.

  [Excerpt] High-ranking Army, Navy, and Air Force officers 
yesterday filed a petition at the Supreme Court challenging the 
constitutionality of the law temporarily suspending the 
political party membership of active duty military and 
policemen. The three petitions, presented separately, were 
signed by General Lino Oviedo on behalf of the Army, Jose 
Cespedes Zarza on behalf of the Air Force, and Vice Admiral 
Flavio Abadie on behalf of the Navy. The petitions request 
putting a freeze on the effects of the law's articles 
temporarily suspending military and police political 
affiliations. Politicians yesterday wondered about the issue of 
Armed Forces institutionalization if the Supreme Court freezes 
the effects of the law. 
  According to court sources, the petition was signed by the 
previously mentioned commanders and by General Eduardo Gonzalez 
Petit, Pedro Concepcion Ocampos, Pablo Abadie, and all officers 
with the rank of lieutenant colonel and up. 
  Gen. Oviedo, Gen. Cespedes Zarza, and Vice Admiral Abadie 
petitions' legal counsels are the attorneys Marcial Pio Flecha, 
Silvino Benitez, and Victor Hugo Ronzwisky respectively. 
  The petitions asked the Supreme Court to freeze the effects 
of the law until it can decide on the law's constitutionality. 
  Cespedes Zarza (Air Force), Vice Admiral Abadie (Navy), and 
Gen. Oviedo (representing the Army) signed the petitions 
separately. 
  According to the attorneys, the three petitions have the 
same 
content--that is, the same legal argument. 
  Court sources said the Supreme Court might accept the 
petitions and freeze the law's effect temporarily. [passage

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 16 
June. 
  A Technical Planning Secretariat document states that 
Paraguay's external debt increased 1.3 percent between January 
and May, rising to $1.2328 billion compared with the $1.2067 
billion at the end of December 1993. The central government is 
the largest debtor with liabilities amounting to $538.3 million, 
followed by government-owned enterprises whose financial 
obligations add up to $472.8 million, and financial 
institutions, whose debts total $221.7 million. Half of 
Paraguay's debt has been contracted with international 
organizations, $615.7 million; 47.8 percent with the Paris Club, 
$589.6 million; and 2.2 percent with Latin American banks, $27.5 
million. The slight increase in the external debt is basically 
due to the disbursement of credits granted by international 
organizations like the Inter-American Development Bank and the 
World Bank. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 16) 
  According to General Customs Directorate data, cotton 
exports 
tumbled in volume and value in the first five months of the year 
compared with the same period in 1993. Farmers had a poor 
harvest caused by bad weather, fungus, and the boll weevil. In 
volume, cotton exports plummeted 51.2 percent to 21,368,249 kg 
compared with 44,051,354 kg last year. In value, exports 
declined 34.6 percent from $49,849,094 in 1993 to $31,919,800 
this year. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 13 Jun 94 p 8) 
  According to the General Customs Directorate, there was a 
surge in the trade deficit in 1994 through May. Exports totaled 
$341.294 million while imports were $1.087 billion, a deficit of 
$746.247 million--a 218.65 percent increase compared with the 
same period last year. This sharp increase in the trade deficit 
reportedly is due to the fact that in the past a considerable 
amount of goods entered the country illegally whereas now there 
is an ongoing campaign to stem smuggling and imports now are 
paying customs duties. It is estimated that total imports amount 
to $3 billion annually, of which only $1 billion was registered 
in the past. This made the government lose more than $200 
million in revenue per year. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 16 
Jun 94)

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Norys Aguirre, president of the </F>
Venezuelan Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund, 
Fogade, by Alfredo Pena at the Venevision studio in Caracas on 
the "Talking With Alfredo Pena" program -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pena] Media polls--and you 
most probably have seen a few of them--indicate that the people 
are complaining--justifiably in my opinion--that the government 
has lied--I do not know whether deliberately or for emotional 
reasons. After the Banco Latino intervention and the banks began 
to receive aid, the chief of state and all others under him said 
that there would be no bank interventions. The [word indistinct] 
said this. We should be able to trust the word of the chief of 
state, of his finance minister, and of other high-ranking 
officials. Look at what is happening now. What do you have to 
say about this? 
  [Aguirre] Good evening, Mr. Pena. Thank you very much for 
inviting me to this program. I would add the name of Fogade 
[Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] President Norys 
Aguirre to the list you mentioned, because I said the same 
thing; that there would be no other interventions. I think, 
however, that after the program to aid banks was instituted on 
25 January, the authorities had the best intention and the firm 
determination of not ordering other interventions, because of 
the dramatic and traumatic effects that they have on depositors, 
especially on the creditors of the institution involved. 
  We tried to rehabilitate these institutions, we tried to 
cover their losses through the guarantees fund, and we tried to 
keep them open. We started an analysis of the situation to study 
alternatives due to the magnitude of the losses [perdidas de 
balance] that we detected and based on the inspections and 
subsequent reports filed by the Bank Superintendency, due to the 
operational losses accumulated by these institutions in the past 
six months, and due to the deterioration caused by deposit 
withdrawals--which did not stop despite all our statements and 
the efforts we made in the past two weeks. We discussed what to 
do with the institutions to avoid an intervention. 
  An intervention process is not something done gradually. 
[sentence as heard] It must be evaluated, thought over. We did 
that for two weeks. Although we said that there would be no more 
interventions, we had to make this decision along with the 
commissioner [not further identified]--who was invited to all 
these working meetings--in which we worked as a team, as 
Venezuelans who seek to solve this problem. We had to make this 
decision. 
  [Pena] You have just reminded us that you said this very 
same thing when you were appointed to Fogade. You repeated those 
same words a few days ago, and they are recorded in Fogade's 
minutes. The media also reported on what you said. You said that 
meetings were held to discuss the recapitalization of the banks 
and to make changes in the boards of directors. You said that if 
the former owners do not have the money to recapitalize the 
banks, that you would recapitalize them but never (?save them). 
What does this mean? 
  [Aguirre] The meetings were scheduled by the General Bank 
Superintendency--they began on 2 March--and were suspended when 
I was appointed. At that time we had a problem; we did not know 
exactly how much the losses amounted to and the deadline for the 
meetings were not met. This being the case, those meetings could 
be contested or be subject to lawsuits. Therefore, it was not 
necessary to do this. The General Bank Superintendency ordered 
the meetings. Except for the Maracaibo meeting, which was held 
on 2 June, the meetings were held between 23 and 25 May. 
However, by late May, the directorate began to review the 
reports presented by the appointed boards--and who did an 
excellent job in only one week--we realized the situation was so 
bad that we asked the General Bank Superintendency for an urgent 
working meeting with the superior council to study the assets 
situation. In addition to the legal problems this could entail, 
Fogade had decided not to cover the losses in light of the huge 
amounts this represented. 
  [Pena] You decided not to cover the losses because [words 
indistinct]? 
  [Aguirre] No. We attended the meetings and made offers 
without having in-depth knowledge of the situation. 
  [Pena] How could you offer to recapitalize those 
institutions 
without having in-depth knowledge of the situation? 
  [Aguirre] Because there was a legal requirement we had to 
meet in light of some contracts signed in January. 
  [Pena] According to statements made by the president of the 
Superior Court for the Protection of Public Property, the court 
is going to investigate public officials who participated in 
that process. Those officials are: the president of the Central 
Bank, the president of Fogade, and the superintendent of banks. 
I believe the Superior Court for the Protection of Public 
Property is doing the right thing because to allegedly protect 
the depositors, you have released more than 500 billion 
bolivares. These 500 billion bolivares belong to those who are 
working on this program with us and to those who are listening 
to us. The Comptroller Law is very clear in this regard. All 
those who handle state money must account for it. This means 
that the court can investigate you. Someone has to account for 
that huge amount of money that has caused inflation and hunger 
among the people. 
  [Aguirre] That is right. All those who handle money must 
account for it. Not only state money; this also applies to the 
private sector. We have a comptroller and we have officials that 
we must account to for all that we do. I agree that an 
investigation should be conducted. When I was appointed in early 
May, late April, I asked the Office of the Comptroller to help 
me. I want the Office of the Comptroller to guide me through 
this. I do not know all the laws and requirements, therefore I 
need the help of the special organizations. I do believe that 
all of us who have had something to do with this process, since 
25 January when we began providing financial aid to the Bank of 
Maracaibo, will have to account for what we have done. 
  You said that 504 billion bolivars were disbursed and that 
this money belongs to you and all those who are here. I agree 
with you completely. It belongs to all the Venezuelan people and 
that is why I have always said that the financial aid program, 
as implemented, had to end. This is why Fogade, and Norys 
Aguirre in particular, felt this program had to end as soon as 
possible. 
  [Pena] On the other hand, it has been said in the 
Venezuelan legislature and courts that funds have been diverted. 
We are talking about money that was supposedly meant for 
depositors but which had a different destination, funds that 
were transferred to be exchanged for dollars, or funds that were 
improperly used. If that is the case, who is responsible for the 
use of funds that belonged to Venezuelans, or for the operations 
carried out by the quote, bank owners, unquote, or for any other 
money transfer? Who had control over them, or did they not have 
to answer to anyone? 
  [Aguirre] As soon as subsidies [auxilios] are distributed, a 
document must be issued under oath. Each time the required funds 
[requerimientos] were delivered, a document was issued under 
oath explaining the origin and use of the funds, the amounts 
requested, how it would be used, and who received the money. We 
are currently investigating the cases when this was not done or 
when someone gave false information. There is a court supported 
by experts from the Superintendency of Banks, the Central Bank, 
and the Judicial Technical Police [PTJ]. 
  The Superintendency of Banks is wholly responsible for the 
supervision process. I believe it is important to understand the 
role played by each of the parties involved. Fogade was created 
to protect depositors, to protect and guarantee the stability of 
the financial system, and to act as a liquidator in cases 
approved by the Superintendent of Banks. The Superintendency of 
Banks is in charge of overseeing, controlling, and supervising 
all activities of the financial system. Fogade delivered and 
implemented the program of financial assistance. The 
Superintendency of Banks subsequently evaluated and supervised 
all activities. That is why there is a judge now, and we must 
let the judge do his job. The judge has announced certain 
measures. If another judge is appointed, as I have read in the 
press, he will also do his job. They are the ones who must 
determine who is responsible. 
  [Pena] Today's edition of EL UNIVERSAL contained an article 
by Gustavo Gomez Lopez in which he states that the intervention 
of his institution was conducted without any type of financial 
assistance, that they were barely given a chance to breathe, 
that criminal charges were filed against them, and that 83 
arrest warrants were issued against the bank. He said that the 
same thing will happen with these eight banks. That is what 
Gomez Lopez said today in EL UNIVERSAL. What are your comments? 
  [Aguirre] It is difficult for me to give my opinion. First, 
I 
have not read the article completely, and second, I was not 
involved in the intervention of Banco Latino. I do not know how 
the intervention process was conducted. I can say that as a 
result of the Banco Latino crisis, and to protect and guarantee 
the stability of the financial system, when depositors began 
withdrawing their funds from the banks in Maracaibo and in 
Barinas, which were the first two affected, there could not be 
interventions or closures at other banks because it would have 
been harmful and created instability. That is why the financial 
assistance plan was implemented. The problem with this plan was 
its duration. The financial assistance plan--as it was 
created--was supposed to last one or two weeks at the most. 
Unfortunately, and as we are all aware, due to the many external 
and internal factors affecting each of the parties involved in 
this problem, the final solution was postponed. 
  [Pena] The government seems to have lost ground in the most 
important area: credibility. President Caldera, as you well 
know, promised to stabilize the bolivar. In the first three 
months of his administration, however, the bolivar has been 
devalued 60 percent. He also promised to eliminate the zero 
coupon. The zero coupon today has reached 60 billion bolivares. 
If the average interest rate is 60 percent, the Central Bank 
will have to pay those banks more than 300 billion bolivares in 
interest. We do not know where it will come from. Although he 
promised to curb inflation, inflation this year could surpass 
100 percent if things remain the way they are. Right? In 
addition, with these subsidies and with the law that will be 
implemented now for 400 billion bolivares, we will have a 
deficit in the GNP of 17 percent. In any country on earth, that 
is called hyperinflation. A few days ago we were told that 
interest rates would go down, but interest rates are again at 
almost 80 percent. How can we believe government representatives 
who say one thing but do another? 
  [Aguirre] I believe the president is the person who, with 
his authority and credibility, informed us of the country's 
situation. On 2 February he announced his government's plan. 
People understood there was not going to be a change of control 
because the situation stabilized. I think the way in which 
conditions evolved made us take other measures. The government 
has worked hard to stabilize fiscal accounts. The objective of 
this public credit law is to meet depositors' needs and end 
financial subsidies once and for all, subsidies that were taking 
us back to that [word indistinct] path you mentioned. I think 
the Bank Superintendency Superior Council members made their 
decision taking into account the country and the fact that we 
could not continue with the subsidy program. We would have 
reached rates in excess of the 80 percent you mentioned, even 
three-digit inflation rates. 
  [Pena] Do you think that what has been happening here is 
typical of Venezuela and perhaps of the Third World? People 
hear rumors in the streets, but the government says they are 
lies. Take the banks as an example. People started withdrawing 
money and dealt a heavy blow to the more than $3 billion in 
reserves. The allegedly financially sound banks took the other 
funds. Since they allegedly did not have a place to deposit 
those funds, they were resold to the Central Bank of Venezuela 
at higher prices. That is what the commissioner called the 
perverse cycle, which is still alive and well. These banks went 
so far as to attempt to penalize pubic officials who, by taking 
precautionary measures, wanted to withdraw these funds from the 
banks to avoid what happened yesterday at the Metropolitan Bank 
and other banks, where people were about to rob them because 
their payrolls [nominas] could not be paid. These officials who 
were withdrawing the funds from the banks wanted to protect 
their workers. The economic team and the team that supervises 
the financial market made public statements saying that public 
officials would not be allowed to withdraw money from these 
banks. 
  [Aguirre] Fifty percent of the money deposited in these 
banks 
belong to 90 percent of the depositors. When those people start 
being paid next week--and I know this is a big effort--they will 
get some respite, because we will begin implementing our payment 
program. That is why the Bank Superintendency, Fogade, and the 
Finance Ministry are hurriedly working to keep the schedule of 
payments announced by the Finance Ministry and Fogade. We must 
pay them because they are not responsible for this crisis. 
  Let me go back to the beginning of your question when you 
said there is a perverse cycle, as the commissioner mentioned. 
You are exactly right. That is what we are trying to end, and it 
ended on 13 June. The cycle no longer exists because it already 
ended. 
  [Pena] It just ended? 
  [Aguirre] Yes, it just ended. 
  [Pena] In ended after the Venezuelan economy bled for three 
months due to this perverse cycle. 
  [Aguirre] We want these deposits to remain in the 
institutions. Deposits must remain there because if there are 
any problems with the financial system or liquidity, it is one 
of the state's functions to help the institution, to adopt 
pertinent measures, to replace administrators, and to impose 
sanctions. The government must do all this the first day. It 
should not have to wait five months. I cannot argue this issue 
with you. I am totally convinced that this situation should have 
ended within the first week or the first 15 days. 
  [Pena] As for the guarantees, you have insisted that they 
fail to back loans. It has even been said that in addition to 
Venezuelans' wearing a tax necklace, we will be lucky if we 
recover 30 or 40 percent of those 500,000 or 800,000 [not 
further specified]. We do not know what it will amount to. We do 
not know if there are inflated assets, and we do not know if we 
were given bad portfolios. We were paid with securities and 
portfolios which could be bad. It seems the only thing that 
could be useful are T-bills and other state securities. The 
truth, Dr. Aguirre, is that we do not know what the rest of 
these securities are. 
  [Aguirre] The state has received about 405 billion [currency 
not specified] worth of physical inventories taken by Fogade. Of 
that 405 billion, some 8 or 10 billion were received in 
securities and stock from some companies, stock that was 
estimated at its par value, I should say. We have yet to 
determine if these companies are profitable, viable companies. 
We do not know if within the group of financial institutions 
involved in the intervention--some 59 companies--there are 
institutions that can be immediately turned around to ensure 
continued production. We have received about 800 billion 
bolivares worth of properties. Someone said the other day in a 
local newspaper that a property received by Fogade at its book 
value of 120 million bolivares must be worth much more than 
that. We all know it is worth much more. 
  [Pena] It is worth less. The thing is, inflation is 
gobbling us up. 
  [Aguirre] No. It is worth much less. 
  [Pena] You get a building for 30 [number as heard, currency 
not specified], at real prices. It is not worth 30, but they 
offer it for 30. It is really worth 10 and they paid the price 
to hand it over to Fogade. Of course, in six months time, they 
will want to invoke the same argument they presented before 
[words indistinct]. That is: Everything I transferred is worth a 
fortune now. Of course, because the currency has devaluated, and 
what with the current devaluation rate things are terrible. 
  The main issue, madam, is that you said and affirmed you are 
going to pay these people their money. 
  [Aguirre] Up to 4 million bolivares. 
  [Pena] Up to 4 million. I understand there was a meeting 
yesterday between Luis Alfaro Ucero and Treasury Minister Julio 
Sosa Rodriguez. Alfaro Ucero told him: We can help you get the 
Public Credit Bill approved. We need to know, however, what you 
are going to do. Are you going to nationalize the banking system 
or what are you going to do? I ask you that same question. 
Alfaro Ucero was clear in warning: If you do not tell us what 
you plan to do, then we cannot support you and the Public Credit 
Bill will not be approved. Are you planning to nationalize the 
banks? Are you going to reorganize the system? What are you 
really going to do? No one really knows. 
  [Aguirre] I think they do. That is the role.... 
  [Pena, interrupting] Are you going to nationalize? 
  [Aguirre] Heavens no. Excuse me, but I think it has already 
been said. I think there has been effective information. That is 
the General Bank Superintendency's job. It is not my place to 
comment on their responsibilities and what the Superintendency 
is doing. However, as a member of the High Commission and a 
participant in the discussions and the work sessions we have 
held, I can say the General Bank Superintendency is working with 
the rest of the financial system. As you may well know, all of 
the local banks must file an adjustment plan by 30 June. It is 
the 15th [date as heard] today, so there are still 15 days for 
the banks to present their plan. According to the new General 
Banking Law, these plans must be studied, discussed by the 
Superintendency and the banks, and put into effect on 1 July. 
  [Pena] Why did you dance around? They closed the Banco 
Latino 
for 85 days. There were several suicides, demonstrations, and 
violence in the streets of Caracas and other cities around the 
country. Following the 85 days of torture and sadism against the 
savings accounts holders, you decide to reopen it. You put a 10 
million ceiling. You imposed no limitations on the banks being 
bailed out. You said: We are going to protect the account 
holders. But anyone could withdraw however much he wanted. I 
understood that protecting the savings accounts meant up to 10 
million. In the United States the ceiling is $100,000, as it is 
anywhere in the civilized world, except here. Here it was take 
as much as you can. Up to now we have given out 500 billion 
bolivares. You let these others pull out however much they 
wanted for three months. Meanwhile you discriminated against the 
Banco Latino account holders, who you forced to capitalize and 
limited to 10 million. Now, you seem to have thought over the 
matter and limited withdrawals to 4 million. Still, those who 
did not comply with Fogade's conditions were allowed to take 
everything they wanted. Is that fair, Ms. Aguirre? 
  [Aguirre] [sighs] That is why, when Fogade holds its general 
assembly, it will study the possibility of increasing the 
guarantee limits to 10 million bolivares. There is one specific 
thing that cannot be hidden. The Banco Latino savings account 
holders were allowed up to 10 million bolivares, based on a 
special transitory law or a temporary provision of the emergency 
banking law. The account holders were paid every penny within 
five months. Now we have said the limit is 4 million bolivares. 
  [Pena] Was it possible to do that from the beginning? 
  [Aguirre] From the very first days of May, when I.... 
  [Pena, interrupting] Why not limit the others as you did 
with 
the Banco Latino? 
  [Aguirre] The limit is in effect. 
  [Pena] Why was the limit not imposed on the other affected 
banks, as you did with Banco Latino, from the very first day? 
  [Aguirre] That is what we did following our decision on 13 
June. I cannot judge what was done as of 25 January. 
  [Pena] Allow me one last question. President Caldera said 
he would not hesitate to sign currency exchange controls. 
Judging from the way things look now, I would say we are closer 
to that decision than when he said he would not hesitate. 
Inflation is higher and reserves are dwindling. I hope you give 
a lot of thought to what you plan to do about that. It is a 
decision the president must make and only he knows what he will 
decide. He has enough experience at this, and I hope we do not 
go back to the days of the Differential Exchange System, which 
was a monster I hope never returns. It was used to extort 
private enterprise, particularly the media. The politicians, led 
by President Lusinchi, got rich with it. There was a Chinese 
individual implicated in this, who was so glorified that they 
are going to make a movie about him. Everyone else came out 
smelling like roses, while Venezuela was left impoverished. 
  Along with the banks, you are now the owners of media 
corporations, investment funds, resorts, hotels, and much more. 
Now we have a government that preaches that it is going to 
privatize things, while it is becoming the owner of an enormous 
piece of the economy. 
  [Aguirre] The state has not become a proprietor of its own 
choosing. I believe the government's policy and philosophy is to 
privatize and be able to deal with its own responsibilities and 
the things the government team is trying to do. 
  We have also established, and we have said this, that 
independent of who does the privatization--be it the Investment 
Fund, Fogade, or salvage companies--the important thing is that 
the state be able to sell all these assets in accordance with 
established sale plans without further harming the economy. You 
cannot sell.... [pauses] I cannot put 79 billion bolivares in 
property on sale today because I would drown the real estate 
market. This has to be planned. 
  [Pena] But there have to be many international banks 
interested in purchasing those banks. 
  [Aguirre] There are banks interested. But we also have other 
assets that were put up to guarantee the financial aid. 
  [Pena] But I am talking about the banks. 
  [Aguirre] There are eight banks and there are banks 
interested. 
  [Pena] Local banks? 
  [Aguirre] Foreign banks. But the foreign banks must study 
the 
banks before they buy. You just do not buy for the sake of 
buying; you have to know what it is you are buying. Venezuela, 
through Fogade, will have to issue a letter of intent. This is 
done in every country of the world. 
  [Pena] When bankers are making a profit they do not remember 
us, but when they report losses, we are the ones who lose. 
  [Aguirre] That is why the state is trying to establish who 
is 
responsible. 
  [Pena] I hope so because I have seen nothing that the state 
is doing. I have not seen the state filing suits against those 
people. 
  [Aguirre] Well you will.... 
  [Pena interrupting] Excuse me, Dr. Aguirre. I have heard you 
say that the courts are responsible for determining the guilty 
party. However, it is the responsibility of the state to present 
charges. The state did not consult the Venezuelan people when it 
used our money. A referendum was not held before using 800 
billion bolivares or before raising inflation to almost 100 
percent. Since the state handled the matter as it did, then it 
should accuse the guilty parties in court. They should be in 
jail. 
  [Aguirre] Fogade appointed its administrators at the 
meetings, people that we removed from where they were working 
and who sacrificed much to help the state. As soon as they gave 
us their report and as soon as we received the report from the 
General Bank Superintendency, Fogade and the government ordered 
the intervention. Fogade and the government are willing to 
determine who was responsible and become the accuser if 
necessary. If there was poor management and if there was fraud, 
we will become the accusers of all those administrators. 
  [Pena] Thank you Fogade President Dr. Norys Aguirre.

  [Text] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] Deputy Julio 
Castillo, a member of the congressional Permanent Finance 
Commission, has said it would be a serious mistake for the 
government to continue subsidizing intervened banks. He said the 
financial assistance granted thus far is equivalent to 
approximately half of the next national budget. 
  According to Castillo, the financial assistance granted thus 
far to banks experiencing problems of liquidity had unleashed 
the inflation process, which is the usual consequence of 
releasing inorganic funds into a weakened economy such as 
Venezuela's. Castillo said his party will ask the executive 
branch to step up the process of reopening the intervened banks 
so they can pay their depositors.

<F P=106> [Report on an interview with Venezuelan Interior Minister </F>
Ramon Escovar Salom by an unidentified reporter at the 
Presidential Palace in Caracas on 16 June] 
  [Text] Upon leaving the Council of Minister's meeting 
yesterday, Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said that what 
we have in the country right now are rumors, rumors, and more 
rumors. 
  [EL NACIONAL] The Defense Ministry said it has information. 
  [Escovar] The Interior Ministry has plenty of information, 
but I have nothing to disclose at this time. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Do you fear public disorder due to the bank 
interventions? 
  [Escovar] Let's wait and see how things unfold. So far we 
have reports of only small incidents, of which you are all 
aware. Right now--it is a little past 1400--I know of no 
demonstrations in Caracas or anywhere else in the country. There 
has been gossip on the street here and there, but nothing to be 
concerned about. There are, however, many rumors. There is a 
rumor factory. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Coming from whom? 
  [Escovar] The rumors come from groups which have an interest 
in spreading them. I have said I will make a statement on that 
particular issue and I will, but not at this time. [end Escovar] 
  Referring to the decree issued by former President Carlos 
Andres Perez granting Venezuelan citizenship to the children of 
illegal aliens, the minister stated: 
  [Escovar] The decree that is in effect is one of the most 
important documents handed down by former President Velasquez. 
Decree 1,911, issued by President Perez, was an irresponsible 
act against Venezuela of historic proportions because it granted 
more privileges to illegal aliens that Venezuelans have 
themselves. When I was prosecutor general, I opposed the decree 
right from the start. I have no doubt whatsoever that the 
Supreme Court of Justice will revoke the decree. When the time 
comes for the Supreme Court to make its decision, the prosecutor 
general will present his case with the arguments he deems best 
at the appropriate time. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Do you believe there are sufficient arguments 
to sustain his case? 
  [Escovar] Of course, more than enough. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Will you participate? 
  [Escovar] No, I will not participate because that is no 
longer within my realm of responsibility. President Velasquez's 
position was supported by 80 percent of the Venezuelan people, 
and President Perez's position was rejected by 80 percent. [end 
Escovar] 
  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas spoke of the 
recently concluded fourth Ibero-American conference in Cartagena 
(Colombia), which was attended by President Rafael Caldera. 
  The discussion included integration, trade, and development, 
but from the beginning it was obvious that politics would, in a 
casuistical manner, be worked into the agenda, as is the case 
with Cuba. 
  [EL NACIONAL] What did you think of Fidel Castro's 
statements? 
  [Escovar] First I would say that Castro's speech, his formal 
speech at the inauguration, was an age-old speech that predated 
the end of the Cold War. It was a memorandum of offenses, of the 
embargo, and against the United States. More important, however, 
was what happened next: First President Caldera, and then 
several other presidents, invited Castro to join the 
inter-American system from the political and legal viewpoint. In 
other words, he was asked to accept the rules of the game of a 
community such as that which exists in this hemisphere; that is, 
rules based on democracy and human rights. 
  As for the achievements (?) of the Castro regime, Burelli 
Rivas said: My opinion is like that of any individual who has 
the democratic conviction that there is no substitute for 
freedom and that social development is not incompatible with the 
exercise of freedom. 
  [EL NACIONAL] What about his statement that he will hold 
elections in Cuba when Cuba is integrated into Latin America? 
  [Escovar] When he was asked to have changes made in Cuba 
with 
him instead of against him, his final statement was, in essence, 
what had been suggested to him. He asked to be allowed to join 
this community whenever there is a broad Latin American 
integration. Well, Latin American integration is moving quickly 
through various channels, and now we are trying to unify all our 
projects. 
  One of the states at the summit offered to host the 
unification meeting, organize all the integration projects, and 
expedite efforts for our countries to join NAFTA and the EU 
earlier than scheduled, which, of course, is not this afternoon 
or tomorrow. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Who suggested that? 
  [Escovar] The president of Paraguay offered Asuncion as host 
city for a unification conference to discuss various projects 
that are in progress and should be consolidated. I think the OAS 
could do a lot in that sense as well. It could serve as the 
focal point for all integration plans that are currently spread 
out and which seek the same goal. 
  [EL NACIONAL] Is it true that the Cuban president was 
invited 
to Venezuela? 
  [Escovar] No, it is not true.

  [Text] The Attorney General's Office, through Prosecutors 
Dumer C. Monzon and Josefina Itriago, has asked 21st Penal Court 
Judge Cibeliz Duran to investigate alleged illegal activities 
that may have prompted the eight banks in which the government 
has intervened to go bankrupt. The inquiry will not conflict 
with the 26th Penal Court's investigation because it will deal 
with the manner in which government financial assistance was 
used. 
  Meanwhile, the Superior Court for the Protection of Public 
Property [TSS] has also initiated an investigation into alleged 
irregularities at the eight banks. The Superior Council of 
Judges must decide whether the case falls under the jurisdiction 
of the TSS or whether Judge Duran should hear the case.

<F P=106> [Report by Zaida Pereira; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast -- passages within quotation marks are recorded] 
  [Text] It is definite. Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez will be questioned by the Chamber of Deputies plenary 
at 1600 on Thursday. This decision was made by the Chamber of 
Deputies after Deputy Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, head of the 
Social Christian Party parliamentary faction, made the 
respective proposal. 
  [Aveledo] "The position is to analyze the problem 
responsibly 
and seriously in order to contribute to solving the financial 
crisis and to contribute to restoring confidence. That is why, 
first, we will not state any position on a censure until we hear 
the minister. He must appear before the Chamber of Deputies to 
explain the government's policy and he must respond to questions 
by the deputies so that we can reach an opinion on this subject." 
  Also, the questioning of Gustavo Roosen, presidential 
commissioner for financial reforms, was requested. He was 
harshly criticized by diverse deputies, including Social 
Christian Party Deputy Luis Estefanelli. 
  [Estefanelli] "Dr. Gustavo Roosen has had, let us say, the 
highest record of generating the flight of currency with the 
remarks he has made. Every time he speaks, Mr. Roosen has 
generated macroeconomic distortions in the system. We don't know 
with what kind of intentions, whether it was good, bad, or 
naivete. I must say that it is difficult to believe that a man 
of his prestige would speak naively." 
  The proposal to question Roosen, however, has not been 
approved. It could be voted on this Wednesday. For his part, 
Luis Emilio Rendon, Democratic Action [AD] Party deputy, 
expressed his party's political position on this. 
  [Rendon] "We have proposed the total removal of the economic 
cabinet by President Caldera. We believe that, once the 
financial and fiscal crisis of the country has been evaluated, 
we must assess the efforts that have been carried out by the 
economic cabinet. We think that we should not limit ourselves 
only to censuring the finance minister, but should go even 
further. The entire economic cabinet has turned in a negative 
work effort, an insufficient balance in terms of the tasks 
assigned to it. There are eight banking institutions that shut 
down yesterday." 
  For Edgar Romero Nava, president of the Venezuelan 
Federation 
of Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
[Fedecamaras], to request the resignation of the economic 
cabinet is to bring on a crisis. The Fedecamaras president said 
that everyone must be in agreement on economic matters, because 
the country needs alternatives rather than criticism. He noted 
that the censuring of the finance minister is political rather 
than economic. He said it is essential to provide solutions and 
this is what the political parties should strive to achieve. 
  [Romero] "I believe that we should all reach an agreement on 
economic topics. Rather than broaching this in a negative 
manner, why don't we sit down and make a concerted effort to all 
get together to try enact the necessary laws. We have to reduce 
ministries, we have to privatize, we have to review the social 
security system. For instance, the United States has 12 
secretariats, while we have 26 ministries. There are many things 
that have to be done here. Let us see where we agree. Let us try 
to inject the economic mechanisms into the country and boost 
optimism among the Venezuelans." 
  Romero Navas announced that as of 17 July the 50th annual 
Fedecamaras assembly will be held to analyze, among other 
things, the government's economic package.

  [Text] The executive branch has instructed Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] to immediately pay up to 
4 million bolivares to depositors of the eight banks intervened 
by government decree, in accordance with Article 23 of the 
special law protecting depositors and regulating emergencies at 
banking institutions. 
  The measure was adopted at a special Council of Ministers 
meeting at Miraflores Palace, where the issue was examined in 
barely 10 minutes. The ministers interpreted the text of the 
law, according to which it is not possible to wait until the 
banks in question are rehabilitated or their debts settled to 
return depositors' funds. 
  The announcement was made by Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez, who said the 13-article decree explains the 
situation. Sosa has announced the General Bank Superintendency, 
Fogade, and the interveners of the eight banks, who were 
discussing payment schedules, have already been notified of this 
decision. 
  [Begin Sosa recording] Payment of the 4 million bolivares 
will begin, to the extent possible, on 27 June. The depositors 
are entitled to 4 million bolivares whether a bank is liquidated 
or rehabilitated, and there is no reason to subject them to 
delays of up to 30 days, which is how long it takes to make that 
decision. There is no reason to subject depositors to that 
deadline. [end recording] 
  Sosa has denied the wave of rumors concerning alleged crises 
at other banks. He said such remarks are unfounded and greatly 
harm the country. Sosa has urged the Venezuelan people not to 
spread such rumors because foreigners, willing to invest in the 
country, purchase Venezuelan Government and private 
institutions' assets when conditions are good and a good effort 
could be wasted.

<F P=106> [Report by Zayra Pereira from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The General Bank Superintendency has announced that 
those depositors holding accounts with banks that have been 
intervened will be receiving reimbursements beginning 27 June. 
  Banks Superintendent Tesalio Cadenas said the metropolitan 
Caracas banks Bancor [expansion unknown] and Banco La Guaira 
will resume operations beginning 23 June. Both banks will begin 
reimbursing depositors up to 100,000 bolivares. Likewise, the 
banks superintendent has said the branches of both banks in the 
interior of the country will also begin operations on 28 June 
and will repay depositors by issuing checks totaling up to 
100,000 bolivares from Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking 
Protection Fund]. 
  Concerning the payment mechanisms and wages, the banks 
superintendent has said: 
  [Begin recording] On 20 June, during sessions of the 
National 
Banking Council, I requested their support, given many people 
will be receiving checks, and with that check [words indistinct] 
as was done in the case of Banco Latino. They can then proceed 
to open an account. Banks operating in the financial system will 
be allowed to continue operations on the afternoon of 23 June 
within a special timetable, because 24 June is a holiday. This 
will allow anyone who so desires to deposit checks, to open an 
account, or, if they agree, to receive their funds in cash. [end 
recording] 
  The banks superintendent said that to [words indistinct] it 
would take some time to complete payment of the 4 million 
bolivares. Banks confronting the most problems are Banco 
Metropolitano and Banco de Maracaibo.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 21 June. 
  The Banco de Maracaibo intervention board believes it is 
still possible to rescue this failing financial institution. The 
intervention board has completed a Banco de Maracaibo rescue 
plan that will be presented before the Banking 
Superintendency--the agency responsible for making a final 
decision on the issue. If the intervention board's plan is 
accepted, Banco de Maracaibo could begin operating again some 
time before 29 June--the date when Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking Protection Fund] is scheduled to reinstate additional 
losses of 7.2 billion bolivares. According to the intervention 
board, Banco de Maracaibo is in a position to reimburse Fogade 
all of the 120 billion bolivares it has received in financial 
assistance so far. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 
GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  The banking liquidity coefficient has fallen to 30.6 
percent. 
The coefficient, which measures cash availability in terms of 
total funds deposited in banks, was 30.6 percent in May. This 
means that for every 100 bolivares deposited by the public, the 
banking system is in a position to immediately provide slightly 
more than 30 bolivares. (Caracas Union Radio in Spanish 1245 GMT 
20 Jun 94) 
  According to Charles Roccia, vice president of Banco 
Provincial de Venezuela, a financing agreement was signed on 15 
June with a syndicate of Portuguese banks headed by Banco de 
Fomento de Portugal. The terms of the agreement include a $20 
million line of credit to be used to finance clients of 
Venezuelan banks who wish to import products from Portugal. Mr. 
Roccia pointed out that the agreement is very significant, 
particularly at this time, because it shows Portugal's 
confidence in the Venezuelan banking system. (Caracas EL GLOBO 
in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 12) 
  In Caracas, state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA) has 
announced that Venezuela will begin selling orimulsion, boiler 
fuel made from heavy oil comprising 70 percent bitumen and 30 
percent water, in the Chinese market as result of a recent 
agreement signed between the North Industries Shenzhen 
Corporation and PDVSA's Bitumenes del Orinoco subsidiary. The 
agreement includes the supply of orimulsion for an electrical 
plant scheduled to begin operations in 1995. The Venezuelan 
company will be responsible to market, sale, and supply the 
orimulsion, as well as providing technical assistance to the 
client. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2018 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  Recently released figures from the Central Statistics and 
Data Processing Office show that imports totaled $2.649 billion 
in the first quarter of the year, reflecting a 31.9 percent drop 
from the same period in 1993. The report also shows that 46.1 
percent of all imports originated in the United States; 7.1 
percent from Germany; 7.0 percent from Japan; 4.6 percent from 
Colombia; 4.2 percent from Italy; 3.2 percent from Brazil; and 
3.0 percent from France. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 16 Jun 
94 p 2-1)

<F P=106> [Quotation marks as published] </F>
  [Text] Dr. Alberto Volonte yesterday expressed his personal 
belief and commitment to "coordinate and agree upon the 
formation of a great team," based on people from the National 
Party with others from parties like the Broad Front or the 
Colorado Party. He said this is a basic priority for success if 
he wins the elections scheduled for November. 
  These were the initial political remarks by the presidential 
candidate who represents two important National Party factions 
(the Herreraist-Wilsonist Sector and the National Proposal) 
following his resignation as UTE [General Administration of 
State Electric Power and Telephones] president. 
  The Herreraist-Wilsonist faction candidate wants the 
National 
Party to have a single candidate for the post of Montevideo 
mayor. Among his proposals, Volonte mentioned priorities like 
managing the country like a large enterprise, keeping the 
current macroeconomic policy, assigning priority to the Mercosur 
[Common Market of the South], pushing ahead with area policies, 
and promoting a broad social agreement similar to the one 
implemented during his tenure at UTE, which yielded very good 
results. Dr. Volonte added that he will promote a meeting with 
other National Party candidates for the presidency of the 
Republic (Pereyra, Ramirez, and Aguirre). He admitted that Dr. 
Juan Andres Rodriguez is a "great candidate" who "will honor his 
nomination" because he is "an exemplary National Party member." 
  It was not easy to talk with Alberto Volonte yesterday. He 
was surrounded by a great number of friends and officials who 
worked with him at UTE and who went to his office to express 
their appreciation for what they consider a "brilliant 
administration." 
  Volonte quickly replied that he could not have succeeded had 
it not been by his "team." He said he had great affection for 
UTE and its people. It is very difficult to leave," he added. 
  Volonte said his campaign began yesterday with a "great 
meeting with his family," his wife, and his four children." 
  Asked about his personal opinion of an eventual single 
candidacy for Montevideo's city hall, Volonte said he was "a 
fervent supporter of the idea" but made it clear that we should 
give priority to "proposals" in the social area. Volonte added 
that he did not fear multiple candidacies. 
  Reiterating a constant opinion during his administration, 
Volonte stressed that Juan Andres Ramirez was "a great 
candidate" who "will honor his designation" because he is "an 
exemplary Blanco Party follower." 
  Asked about his opinion on surveys, Volonte stressed the 
professional work of survey companies and surveyors. He said he 
took them as a "reference" adding that he did not feel he was a 
survey "slave" and that he did not worry about surveys or how he 
fared in them. 
  He emphasized that the greatest survey "will be conducted on 
the last Sunday in November [election day]." 
  Asked if he would introduce changes in current economic 
policies, Volonte without hesitation said that he agreed with 
current macroeconomic policies oriented towards Mercosur. He 
added that these policies were supported by all political 
parties -- unlike any previous economic policy. 
  Volonte added he would only to change the emphasis on some 
aspects, that he would like to emphasize social programs such as 
education, health, and public security." 
  Reporters questions forced Volonte to compare his 
administration at UTE with an eventual administration as 
president of the country. 
  "Countries are large enterprises in today's world. Uruguay 
is 
an enterprise full of illusions, an enterprise moved by our 
entire society. We believe the country can become a great 
enterprise. I think we can use the experience of a great 
enterprise like UTE on a national scale." 
  Volonte mentioned the need to promote a great social pact, 
perhaps with characteristics like the pact promoted by his 
administration at UTE. 
  "I have no doubt that there must be an agreement between 
those responsible for production and those in leadership 
positions. At UTE, we had more than a pact; we had a 24-month 
agreement that established labor relation rules on the way to 
improve workers' salaries through productivity. I think the 
formula can be applied to the entire state apparatus to obtain 
better salaries, and thus achieve agreement and understanding 
among all Uruguayans." 
  The former UTE director does not agree with remarks by some 
political and social quarters that his group lacks the support 
of a technical apparatus. He said those remarks were incorrect 
because the "apparatus and the organization are the people. The 
willingness is derived from the people. Uruguayans have an 
opinion and can distinguish very well. No one has to be led by 
the hand to vote.... 
  The presidential candidate said: If elected president on 27 
November, he will try first to reach an agreement with his party 
and then with other political parties. He said he would thus 
define his cabinet and form a great team. He said he will 
discuss with other leaders -- those now in government and others 
-- if they will be part of the team. The team will be formed 
following an agreement and discussions with other parties," 
Volonte said. 
  Volonte told EL PAIS that his first steps in the political 
arena will be to meet with the other National Party candidates, 
that is, with Senator Carlos Julio Pereyra, Senator Juan A. 
Ramirez, and Gonzalo Aguirre.

<F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with former President Julio Maria </F>
Sanguinetti, the leading presidential contender, by unidentified 
reporter; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [BUSQUEDA] You recently signed an agreement with 
the PGP [Party of the Government by the People]. Why did you 
pursue such an agreement? 
  [Sanguinetti] First, we felt the country may have become 
entrapped in an ironclad option between an already obsolete 
neo-conservative concept and a populist concept of the 
collective type which could push the country backwards. We felt 
the pressing need to propose another option, an option that in 
Uruguay has traditionally been called Battlism and in other 
countries social democracy or social liberalism. The only way to 
save the country from having to decide between those dangerous 
options -- and when I say dangerous I am not talking about 
people but about the consequences of their ideas -- was to offer 
the country the option Uruguayans really want, that is, a market 
economy as free as possible with the state orientating and 
compensating. We felt the PGP was very close to these ideas. 
  Second, we felt our two movements were merely returning to 
our common roots. I entered the political field in 1953, when I 
was 17, together with Selmar Michelini and Manuel Flores Mora 
[reference unknown]. Batlla was already in politics at that 
time. 
  Third, we considered it essential to try to put together a 
coalition capable of governing. That decision meant we needed to 
unite with other groups. We went out looking for our old friends 
and possible associates to embark together in this beautiful 
enterprise of forming a new government to welcome the beginning 
of the new century. 
  Fourth, we felt then -- just as we feel today -- that the 
election is not yet decided in Uruguay, or in Brazil, because 
the idea of the demise of world Marxism has yet to percolate 
down to the local parties that follow that ideology. They are 
against history, but they are a reality nonetheless. 
  Fifth, we considered it essential to show to the country 
that 
we had the capacity to unite, to agree. We wanted to stop the 
endless political stories of divisions, splits, or attacks. We 
want change. We want to face the challenge of involving most 
Uruguayans in the belief that it is possible to improve our 
standards of living and our democratic coexistence day by day, 
without haste, without pause, and without hypocritical or 
destructive urgency. [passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] What are, in your opinion, our national 
priorities? 
  [Sanguinetti] Without defining which points are more 
important than others, we think it is essential to implement an 
education reform to review the content of our education and to 
prepare our youngsters for life in a more technical world. 
Uruguay's future competitiveness depends on what we do now in 
that field. It is also very important to recover our exporting 
capacity in order to sustain genuine growth. Improvements in 
this area depend on improved competitiveness. We must propose a 
scheme of harmonious development and avoid having to choose 
between the false options of either production or services. I 
recall in the past, we were confronted with the false dilemma 
between agricultural or industrial development. It the area of 
social development it is essential to implement integration 
policies aimed at reducing inequalities and marginalization. We 
must reform the social security system with the double purpose 
of assuring pensioners who live in continuous insecurity and 
creating a more just and lest expensive system. These four 
priorities are conditioned to the insertion of the country into 
the international and regional markets. 
  [BUSQUEDA] How do you see the issue of social security 
reform? 
  [Sanguinetti] For some years demographic trends have shown 
that today we are living longer and better, which is excellent 
and welcomed. But this, naturally, affects the social security 
system, which has become a real burden on our economy. During my 
administration we had two unsuccessful reform bills. During this 
administration, one reform attempt failed and another was 
partially successful and was included in the 1992 budget. There 
were other efforts to modify the Constitution to include the 
indexation concept, which was financed with the fiscal 
adjustment for which we all voted. But we cannot continue to 
discuss the issue forever. Pensioners deserve tranquility. We 
must be able to tell them the debate has ended because the 
system's future has been consolidated. Workers should have the 
option of joining public or private systems, as in other 
countries. The state cannot just look the other way. We will not 
advance by believing the problem will be solved by adjusting 
collection rates and reducing evasion. These are important 
factors but they are not enough. We can continue the very unfair 
system of ceilings. Naturally, a reform of this type requires 
political and social maturity, a serene discussion, without 
verbal terrorism, and without populist complexes. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Is this part of the social pact that you propose? 
  [Sanguinetti] It could be a very significant part of it. I, 
however, think a social pact should go beyond this topic. We 
must avoid sterile and tiring confrontations among workers, 
managers, and the state. We must agree and progress past the 
points that have been agreed everywhere else in the world. 
  [BUSQUEDA] What for instance? 
  [Sanguinetti] On increased productivity, for example, which 
is essential if we are to continue to maintain our companies and 
the country's competitiveness. Without it, we would be risking 
jobs, not just our salaries. This does not mean we will 
condition everything to productivity, but we cannot ignore the 
concept. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Broad Front candidate Tavare Vazquez dismissed 
your proposal of a "social pact" as an attempt to silence the 
workers. What is you opinion on the matter? 
  [Sanguinetti] We regret it. He says it is time to confront, 
respectfully, but confront nonetheless. He insists that we 
should not have state policies. I really regret that. I do not 
know if Vazquez made this statement during a discussion with his 
fellow party member Danilo Astori, who proposed something 
similar, or if he is arguing with us. The conclusion, however, 
is the same and it is very discouraging. The culture of 
confrontation has only produced problems for the country and 
losses for the workers. The workers can improve their situation 
with prosperity, and prosperity requires peace and investments. 
  [BUSQUEDA] It is said -- inside and outside the government 
-- that the trade deficit is not important, that what counts is 
the surplus in the balance of payments. What is your opinion of 
this? 
  [Sanguinetti] During the previous administration exports 
grew 
by more than 70 percent, since when levels have remained 
unchanged. The previous administration pursued an 
outward-looking model, whereas this administration follows an 
inward-looking policy. A country may have a trade deficit for a 
few years, but it is impossible to sustain this situation 
forever. A country must export to maintain its capacity to 
import. To believe we can continue to import indefinitely 
without increasing our exports would lead us to a most risky 
situation. We already saw this during the times of the "Exchange 
Rate Table" in Uruguay and Argentina back in 1981 and 1982. We 
therefore have experience of this. I consider the following 
essential: Does anyone believe the ability to import is not 
linked to the ability to export? We want an open system that 
promotes imports, but this in turn means fostering exports. If 
not it will be unsustainable over time. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Do you believe this situation will end in a major 
devaluation like it did in 1982? 
  [Sanguinetti] One must be very mindful of verbal terrorism. 
Yet those who placed the country in jeopardy should provide you 
with the answer. These are the same experts who categorically 
denied there was an exchange lag last year and now they talk 
about it as if it were the most natural thing in the world. They 
say, of course, that it is unimportant. In the past, it was 
nonexistent and now it is unimportant. This is a totally 
arbitrary answer because they contend that it can be sustained 
indefinitely without proving how. To explain why reserves are 
high is a logical contradiction, it is tantamount to begging the 
question. We already know reserves are plentiful, the important 
thing is to prevent them from disappearing if the government 
loses credibility. 
  [BUSQUEDA] The thing is that for the time being there is no 
pressure on the dollar.... 
  [Sanguinetti] ...Thank God.... 
  [BUSQUEDA] ...and another fact is that the trade balance 
only 
measures goods rather than other exports like tourism. Do you 
take this fact into account? 
  [Sanguinetti] Of course, but those have always been taken 
into account. That is nothing new. The main thing is that the 
balance of payments, as a whole, is already registering 
problems. It is common knowledge that the inflow of foreign 
capital, which was prompted by the decline in interest rates in 
the United States, has been checked following their upturn. This 
is the very fundamental difference between the balance of trade 
and the balance of payments. Goods cannot be created overnight. 
Businesses require time and organization. Capital can be 
invested and withdrawn from financial placements in a matter of 
seconds; it is very volatile. The wind changes direction and it 
is gone. It is not I who says so -- I am not an expert -- 
Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has brought attention 
to this issue with great concern. [passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] What do you intend to do to come to grips with 
the 
"exchange lag" about which exporters complain? Will you devalue 
the peso, increase tariffs, or implement tax refunds? 
  [Sanguinetti] One cannot view the issue in black and white; 
either a "major devaluation" or "no devaluation at all." The 
exchange rate policy, the tariff policy, and the policy on tax 
refunds are three elements; there are others that can be 
combined with them. The most important thing is to try to 
recover competitiveness. This is my overriding concern for the 
future. How will this be achieved? This is what we will have to 
see at the appropriate time. Here the presence of experts is 
fundamental. One cannot address the issue of the recovery of our 
competitiveness by implementing an isolated measure -- not even 
a major devaluation will achieve this objective if it sparks a 
spiral of rising wages and prices. 
  [BUSQUEDA] In short, what will your exchange rate policy be 
like? 
  [Sanguinetti] It will be basically realistic. This will be 
the fundamental parameter. The exchange rate cannot be used to 
excess for political reasons. Every time we did that over the 
last 40 or 50 years the result was not positive. 
  [BUSQUEDA] If you governed now, would you devalue the peso? 
  [Sanguinetti] That is a question that should be exclusively 
and strictly put to he who steers the economic policy. 
  [BUSQUEDA] And how about March 1995? 
  [Sanguinetti] Nobody can in all seriousness speak about that 
nine months in advance. That decision depends on fundamental 
international factors, interest rates, neighboring countries, 
many things. Nobody can in all seriousness anticipate what will 
happen.The terrible thing is that the colossal inflation in 
dollars that we have has caused everybody to talk about this 
issue. This reveals a very important shortcoming in the current 
policy. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Your economic team includes, among others, 
well-known members of the economic team of your presidency: 
Ricardo Zerbino, Ariel Davrieux, Ricardo Pascale, and Luis 
Mosca, for example. If you win the elections, will you use that 
same team as of 1995? 
  [Sanguinetti] In the council, without a doubt, because they 
have been advising the party on these important matters without 
interruption since 1993. The disposition of the teams will 
depend on the circumstances at that time. Younger people who 
have emerged must also be heard. People from the PGP, for 
example, are very valuable and will surely have interesting 
contributions. [passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] You have said the Broad Front is your adversary, 
which provoked a rebuke from the National Party because it seems 
you will exclude them from the election confrontation. What can 
you say about this? 
  [Sanguinetti] Regrettably this is the sum of incomplete 
information plus inexact interpretations. We respect everyone 
equally and insist that the election has not yet been defined. 
For about two years now the Broad Front has led the polls 
without interruption in Montevideo, with the Colorado Party 
closing every day and the National Party continuing to drop 
behind. In other words, fair or not, the Colorado Party is the 
only party in a position to defeat the Broad Front. Things may 
change tomorrow, but this is how matters are, and have been for 
some time now. At the national level matters are not the same, 
but nobody can dispute the fact that the Colorado Party is the 
only organization with a chance of defeating the Broad Front. 
This is a dispassionate and measurable fact. [passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] It seems you are making Tabare Vazquez, the Broad 
Front candidate, out as "dangerous." Is that so? 
  [Sanguinetti] In no way.I really respect him. He had not 
occupied an important public post and yet he won the Montevideo 
mayoral elections and maintains his popularity. He is an 
extraordinary man. He merits all my respect as a veteran 
politician who knows how difficult it can be. I disagree with 
many of his ideas and I disagree with the Broad Front as a 
political party. But that is normal in the democratic debate. I 
greatly respect and have a lot of affection for [Broad Front 
Leader] General Liber Seregni, but this does not mean that I 
cannot continue to disagree with the Broad Front. 
  [BUSQUEDA] But you gave more importance to the confrontation 
with Mayor Vazquez: When he spoke of establishing a 
"collectivist" society, you criticized him very harshly.... 
  [Sanguinetti] ...it is generally said that all ideas are 
respectable, but this is not so. Individuals rather than ideas 
should be respected. There are loathsome ideas like racism, 
which must be combated. There are despicable ideas like 
collectivism, which advocates the abolition of private property. 
Thus my considered opinion is that one must fight against it. 
  [BUSQUEDA] You have one dispute with the Broad Front and 
another with the current administration, which cropped up 
recently, during the election campaign. Government officials 
have compared the economic results under your administration 
with the present economic achievements and conclude that they 
fared better than you. What do you have to say about that? 
  [Sanguinetti] I neither encouraged that comparison nor think 
it is relevant because the important thing is the future. Yet if 
one wants to look at objective economic indicators--as 
government officials claim to do--we have a clear conscience. 
During the four years 1985 to 1989, the GDP grew by 20.7 percent 
whereas during four years under a Blanco Party administration 
the GDP grew by 13 percent. While this is not bad, it is much 
less than under our administration. Exports in dollar and volume 
terms rose by 73 percent during my administration while now they 
are stagnant. This is a most serious situation because it has 
led to an all-time record defcit of $700 million annually. This 
proves the driving force behind the country's economic growth, 
namely the modern sector that exports and purchases technology, 
has ground to a halt. Salaries -- something basic -- increased 
by 30 percent in real terms under the previous administration. I 
repeat -- in real terms. I am not speaking in dollar terms as is 
done now. We are all aware that this is misleading when there is 
a 20-percent annual dollar inflation. During President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle's tenure, salaries have risen by just 3 percent 
in real terms. This is a very significant difference, which 
shows the fundamental contrast between adjustment with growth -- 
as done during the previous administration -- and a merely 
financial adjustment as is done now. I think that these are 
overwhelming figures, which by the way are all official. 
[passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] Economy and Finance Minister Ignacio de Posadas 
has said that you are telling "lies," that you are engaged in 
"cheap demagogy." Have you any comments on that? 
  [Sanguinetti] I would like to believe that it was just said 
in a fit of temper. [passage omitted] 
  [BUSQUEDA] Another subject that led to estrangement between 
you and the current administration is the policy on the Armed 
Forces. President Lacalle has hinted that not "everybody" helped 
when he faced problems in this area, obviously alluding to you. 
What is your opinion of it? 
  [Sanguinetti] I acknowledge, much to my sorrow, that we had 
a 
difference of opinion on that issue. This should never have 
happened. Unfortunately, our differences began during the period 
between the two administrations when the president wanted to 
appoint a Navy commander in chief who did not have the rank of 
rear admiral, but was a ship-of-the-line captain. He completely 
overlooked the four rear admirals on active service. I am not 
crazy about the criterion of appointing the most senior in 
military matters. He could have chosen the first, the second, or 
the fourth, but he should not have outflanked them all, 
especially when it was obvious he was trying to nominate 
somebody very close him politically. That was the starting-point 
of our differences. We never wanted to make them public until 
they went beyond what was reasonable. As a result of the 
interpellation proposed by United Batlleism Senator Carlos 
Cigliutti, the Defense Minister Mariano Brito fell as he 
acknowledged that a general had engaged in telephone espionage 
in a case involving his colleagues. These events did not entail 
a confrontation between the military and civilian powers, but 
rather infighting within the Armed Forces sparked by those whom 
this administration favored with a post within the government. 
Moreover, the one responsible for this espionage, General Mario 
Aguerrondo, presently enjoys a remunerative job -- paid in 
dollars -- abroad. This has caused great damage to the general 
climate within the Army. It is really most regrettable and I 
hope we will be able to overcome it. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Do you not believe the situation improved with 
the 
appointment of [Army] Commander in Chief Daniel Garcia? 
  [Sanguinetti] I take his good intention and honest purposes 
for granted. Unfortunately, his methods have sometimes led to 
internal debates and questioning. This is not good because the 
Armed Forces need unity and we should all help to promote this 
unity. We will never build anything by fanning the flames of 
controversy. The reason for our success in the transition period 
was to a large extent that we always strived for unity and 
professionalism. 
  [BUSQUEDA] The Batllist Forum has said that during this 
administration the Armed Forces have been "stripped of their 
professionalism" and "made to become partisan." If you won the 
elections what would you do to revert this situation? 
  [Sanguinetti] Our administration is a good example of how it 
ought to be done. The first general I had to promote was General 
[Juan M.] Rebollo, the son of a Blanco Party minister, and one 
of the last was Lieutenant General Garcia, when nobody expected 
this promotion. We decided on it simply by rigorously analyzing 
his professional merits. Any government that seeks to preserve 
the Army's unity will act the same way. 
  [BUSQUEDA] Do you feel hostility towards the president? 
  [Sanguinetti] By no means. Dr. Lacalle is the president of 
the Republic and I have no right to feel hostility toward him. 
We may have some differences of opinion, but I have had -- and 
will always have -- the greatest of respect for him both as a 
person and on account of the high post he holds.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 16 
June. 
  According to the Central Bank, the central government 
registered a $15 million deficit in April compared with a $24 
million surplus in the same month last year. Tax revenues 
declined 2.2 percent and export earnings fell 5 percent due to 
tariffs cuts. The government's surplus in the first four months 
of the year shrank to $14.1 million compared with the $103 
million surplus in the same period in 1993. The reason is that 
government spending increased 11.7 percent in real terms in the 
first four months of the year compared with the same period last 
year. Social security expenditures, which represent 41.3 percent 
of the government's current expenditures, showed the highest 
increase -- 23 percent. Investments rose 45 percent, totaling 
$120 million in four months. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO 
in Spanish 6 Jun 94 p 9) 
  In its Monetary Balance released on 3 June, the Central 
Bank, 
BCU, reported that its net international reserves have 
maintained the rate of growth registered since July 1993 with 
the exception of November 1993. They increased $21.2 million in 
May, thus totaling $1.28 billion. This performance indicates 
that despite the growing trade deficit the balance of payments 
continues to show a surplus, which amounted to $78 million in 
May. The two main factors that accounted for the rise in 
reserves were a $35 million increase in banking system deposits 
in the BCU and the net purchase of $23.5 million in foreign 
exchange by the BCU. Despite the increase in net international 
reserves in May, the BCU foreign exchange position registered a 
$4.5 million contraction last month, declining to $44.6 million. 
The BCU Monetary Balance also reported that the money supply 
contracted in May due to a reduction in net domestic credit, 
which was prompted by the increase in the banking system 
deposits in the BCU. (Montevideo BUSQUEDA in Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 
31) 
  Industrial production was down 18.1 percent in the first 
quarter of the year. Excluding oil refining, which has been 
paralyzed since April 1993, the contraction in industrial 
production was 5.9 percent by volume. The sharpest decline was 
in "chemical substances," mainly due to the aforementioned 
paralyzation. The drop in the employment rate is seen in both 
the 12.6 percent decline in hours worked as well as the 13.6 
percent shrinkage in hired workers. This is especially 
significant in the "textiles, garments, and leather industry." 
(Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 9 Jun 94 Market Indicators 
Section p 1) 
  The BCU reported on 3 June that Uruguay's net external debt 
decreased 3.7 percent to $1.838 billion in the first quarter of 
the year due to an increase in international reserves. The gross 
debt, however, increased $77 million, totaling $4.369 billion at 
the end of March. Liabilities in the nonfinancial public sector 
were $3.7466 billion. Loans to the central government and 
government-owned enterprises accounted for more than half this 
amount while liabilities from the issuance of public securities 
in foreign currency accounted for the remaining $1.558 billion.

  [Text] During the past month, Dutch Marines have undergone 
all kinds of training in unfamiliar terrain. The exercises that 
were held in the jungle of Suriname came to an end last Thursday 
[16 June]. The Dutch and Surinamese participants have dubbed it 
a success. But Marion Riedewald says the exercises were, 
however, not incident free as one Surinamese corporal is 
reported to have drowned during the training. 
  [Begin recording] [Riedewald] Twenty-eight year old Corporal 
Lief Sanchez drowned last Monday [13 June] during the 
transportation of food to the troops being trained in the jungle 
in Saramacca District. Participants observed one minute's 
silence in remembrance of Corporal Sanchez at a presentation of 
certificates last Thursday. 
  The training was conducted by 10 Surinamese warfare 
instructors, who got their training in Brazil. It was the first 
time in 27 years that Surinamese and Dutch soldiers trained 
together. The exercises are the result the renewed relationship 
between the Surinamese and Dutch Army after the installation of 
Colonel (R.T. Houre) as chief commander of the Surinamese Army. 
The purpose of the exercises was to get the Dutch Marines some 
knowledge of the Surinamese jungle. Captain Tim Van der Leyle, 
who was leading the Dutch group, shared his experience with us: 
  [Begin recording] [Van der Leyle] We had a very heavy rains, 
so the terrain was very difficult, and also logistic support was 
difficult because of the weather and the terrain. We have had 
several people who, because of injuries, had to go out of the 
terrain for a certain period, but after their recovery we put 
them back into training. 
  [Riedewald] Forty-four Dutch Marines, based in the 
Netherlands Antilles, took part in the exercises, which were 
conducted for a month in the Surinamese jungle. [end recording]

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 21 Jun (AFP) -- Dante Caputo, former 
Argentine foreign minister and current UN/OAS mediator in the 
Haitian conflict, delivered to Dominican President Joaquin 
Balaguer the list of food supplies and medicines exempt from the 
embargo imposed against the Haitian military regime, it was 
announced this Tuesday. 
  Balaguer met with Caputo the night of 20 June, without prior 
notice, at his office at the Government Palace. This is 
Caputo's third visit with the Dominican president for 
discussions on the Haitian crisis with the goal of reinforcing 
control of the 300-km border between Haiti and the Dominican 
Republic, two nations that share the Caribbean island of 
Hispanolia. 
  Caputo stated a copy of the list delivered to Balguer was 
sent approximately 10 days ago to the Dominican Foreign Ministry. 
  Recently, Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral 
stated 
Caputo had not sent the list within the timeframe that was 
agreed with Balaguer during a prior meeting at which Ambassador 
William Gray, President Bill Clinton's special envoy for the 
Haitian crisis, had been present. During this meeting, Balaguer 
accepted the sending of U.S. advisers and equipment to reinforce 
the embargo along the Dominican-Haitian border. 
  Trade between the two nations since then has been 
semiparalyzed and is only allowed twice a week for four hours 
across the most transited border crossing. 
  "We have delivered what we promised," Caputo said this 
Tuesday, referring to the document which contains, according to 
what he pointed out, "the basic explanation of the (UN) 
resolution to enforce a total embargo against the neighboring 
nation." 
  Concerning the United Nations sending advisers and equipment 
to verify the compliance of the border embargo, Caputo said, "by 
the way, I held conversations last night (...) and logistic 
support and equipment coordination are being implemented." 
  The Argentine diplomat said: "We are very concerned with the 
Haitian situation, and we are doing everything possible within 
our power" to speed up the resolution to the crisis. 
  After meeting with Balaguer, Caputo traveled to the 
Dominican-Haitian border without giving an explanation as to how 
long he would remain there. "We will see," he told reporters 
when questioned. 
  Dominican President Joaquin Balaguer openly opposes the 
embargo against the Port-au-Prince military; nevertheless, he 
agreed to send soldiers to the border to prevent gasoline 
smuggling after meeting with Ambassador Gray.

<F P=106> [First of three installments of an interview with </F>
Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army, 
by Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona jungle; date not given; 
first four paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction] 
  [Text] If in the course of the coming two months there is 
not a real democratic opening, Mexico will face an imminent 
general war, Subcommander Marcos warned in an interview. "What 
we are doing is opening a waiting period and appealing to 
civilian society, to its most representative sectors, to stage a 
civil mobilization, virtually as the last call to initiate a 
peaceful transition to democracy." 
  For the Zapatist leader, the "government's myopia" does not 
allow it to see that "there are armed groups in several parts of 
the republic" which are growing. He says that one way or 
another, the outbreak of what would be a civil war is imminent, 
"not a war between two armies, but a war among many armies." He 
added that the only way to stop it is to provide a truly 
democratic opening, which "is still possible today." 
  Subcommander Marcos affirmed that the historic 
responsibility 
for this war falls on the government for having refused to face 
this political crisis by providing the possibility of having a 
peaceful transition to democracy. 
  The following is the first of a three-part interview from 
the 
Lacandona Jungle: 
  [Ibarra] Subcommander, you rejected the government's 
proposals. What remains to be done now? 
  [Marcos] What we are doing is reviewing what happened after 
the dialogue, respecting the government's decision to provide a 
democratic opening, and to fulfill the EZLN's [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] demands for justice. What we did was to engage 
in consultations and establish contacts with other social 
groups, which insisted that the EZLN's demands were not being 
fulfilled in the rest of the country or in the rest of the State 
of Chiapas. 
  What we are doing is opening a new waiting period and 
appealing to civilian society, to its most representative 
sectors, to conduct a civil mobilization, virtually as the last 
opportunity or the last call to initiate a peaceful transition 
to democracy. What we envision and what the government's myopia 
does not allow it to see is that the problem of refusing to 
permit the transition to democracy is not an EZLN problem. What 
I mean is that the government was betting that if it did not 
wipe out the EZLN, it would sign a peace agreement and this 
would eliminate the possibility of war. We know, however, that 
there are armed groups in several parts of the republic, which 
the political climate is causing to grow and which one way or 
another will lead to an outbreak. The only way to stop this is 
to yield before that happens and to provide a truly democratic 
opening. 
  [Ibarra] According to you, we are facing an imminent general 
war in Mexico? 
  [Marcos] Definitely. What we think is that an effort 
beforehand toward a peaceful transition is still possible, or at 
least a transition through the electoral path in August. If we 
insist on that, if society is mobilized sufficiently, although 
there is hardly enough calendar time from now till 21 August, if 
the mobilization is given, it could be very intense in historic 
terms. What we are trying to make the nation understand is that 
an imminent war, following the failure of a peaceful path toward 
democracy, does not depend on us. Other groups will rise up. 
There is not going to be any control. It will be what is 
called a civil war, not a war between two armies, but a war 
among many armies. It will become impossible to speak to 
anyone. There will be no mediators and this will create 
problems for everyone, for all the belligerent parties. 
  [Ibarra] Are you not, however, contributing to this outbreak 
with your no? 
  [Marcos] No, what we are doing is what we did on 1 January, 
warn the people of a situation. When we say no, we are again 
revealing the masquerade that prevails in this country, which 
would have been consolidated had we accepted the peace 
agreement. Efforts were made to make the people, including 
foreigners, believe that the problem had been resolved. Then 
the people would be surprised again by the outbreak of a civil 
war. What we are doing is maintaining the role we have had, 
alerting the people to what could happen in this country and not 
saying it. [sentence as published] 
  [Ibarra] We are not talking about a simple rejection. You 
have said no, and at the same time, you raise your demands; you 
demand President Salinas' resignation and even threaten him with 
a political trial. Is that correct? 
  [Marcos] Yes. We insist that history has again confirmed the 
justness of our demands. At the beginning, in January, when we 
demanded President Salinas' resignation, people thought we were 
crazy, but now they realize that what would be crazy would be 
letting him stay in power. All the subsequent incidents 
confirmed that no one is sitting in Los Pinos; there is no 
control over the country; there is a de facto ungovernability; 
and the figure of the federal executive branch is just that, a 
figure. One way or another many forces are loose within the 
group in power which, as a result of their internal struggle, 
are dragging the rest of the country with them. That is what we 
mean when we insist on the need for a transition government. 
There should be an agreement among those powerful groups to give 
the power to those who really should have it, in other words, to 
the people. 
  Those who, in January, believed we were crazy, in March, 
have 
realized that the others are the ones who are crazy. The 
federal executive branch's historical responsibility is refusing 
to deal with the situation of political crisis that began in 
January 1994 and is refusing to yield to the democratization 
drive, or at least permitting a regulated transfer, which is 
what a transition government does. Arrogance and disdain, 
however -- how can an Indian tell me I have to leave -- is what 
makes him cling to power, what makes him deceive the nation with 
a dialogue process disguised as negotiation to deceive the stock 
market, investors, and finally the United States and Canada 
because of NAFTA. 
  The lack of control in the rest of the country is also 
reflected in the internal group of power and leads to a series 
of internal adjustments, which causes so many problems. Salinas 
is responsible for that; therefore, he should finally resign and 
leave the presidency. He cannot leave with his hands clean or 
try to make people believe that his hands are clean if they are 
really dirty. Even if he resigns, he must be called to trial to 
explain to the nation why he acted the way he did; why he 
governed the way he did, or why he misgoverned the way he did at 
a crucial time in our country's history. The current federal 
government will be responsible should a civil war begin, with 
all its consequences. 
  [Ibarra] Until now, we have heard about the EZLN's presence 
in Chiapas. In one of your communiques, however, you issued 
orders to forces in the nation and abroad. What does that mean? 
  [Marcos] Well, this case is the same as the masquerade that 
was created in the sense that this was a local state problem to 
say the least, or even worse, reducing it to the four 
municipalities where it started. Anyone who commands a military 
institution, however, knows that no army deploys all its troops 
in its first move. It is clear that the EZLN only sent part of 
its forces into action on 1 January. It must have other forces 
in reserve. Moreover, it is clear that the banner the EZLN 
raises is beginning to receive support from other sectors, other 
groups, even clandestine groups, that in one way or another are 
joining the EZLN's struggle and accepting its military 
direction, both in other parts of the country and in other 
nations. 
  Therefore, we are addressing them to let them know what our 
no means, to let them know that we have not accepted the 
proposed agreements, that we have not surrendered. At the same 
time, to let them know that we have left a space open to permit 
the organization of civilian society or to let them express 
their discontent through peaceful means. On the other hand, we 
again addressed the nation to insist that trying to reduce the 
problem to the State of Chiapas is deceitful. We want to stress 
once again that we have a national problem here, a problem of 
national war, which is now facing three possibilities: the path 
of a peaceful or political solution, of transition to democracy; 
second, a regular war between regular armies, which is why the 
EZLN insists on its recognition as a belligerent force; and 
third, which would be the worst solution, a civil war, with many 
heads or without any head, with many forces fighting among 
themselves, without any clear division between each one, between 
one contender and another. We are warning the nation about that 
possibility. We are pointing out a reality: that we are a 
national army, that we exist throughout the nation, and that we 
can carry out military operations throughout the national 
territory and in some other places abroad. 
  [Ibarra] Do you think you stand a chance of victory even 
though you have only a few weapons? 
  [Marcos] In military terms, there are three variables: land, 
climate, and morale. A well-equipped, well-armed, and 
well-trained army that has problems with climate and morale can 
be defeated by an ill-equipped army that has the advantage in 
terms of land, climate, and morale. The way the Zapatist Army 
has been growing -- they may deceive themselves into thinking it 
has only occurred in this state -- shows a line of military 
progression. The EZLN is growing and establishing itself in the 
natural surroundings of its troops. That means the EZLN has 
already gone through what would be the acclimatization period 
for any regular army, and troops are joining the EZLN in its own 
territory. We do not think we stand a chance of defeating the 
federal Army militarily, but we do believe we can resist an 
all-out offensive for a long time, and that includes all the 
known military options, from the surgical strike to razing the 
civilian population. One way or another, the government -- and 
foreign countries as well -- must realize that if war begins, a 
regular war between two perfectly defined armies at best, they 
must be prepared to wage a lengthy war lasting many years, where 
the land and climate will be major factors in favor of the EZLN. 
Whether they like it or not, the federal Army will have to act 
as an occupation army. 
  [Ibarra] Are there any options to war? 
  [Marcos] The only option would be for society to stage a 
mobilization prior to the elections. Then the cost estimates 
done by government and Pentagon computers would show it is more 
expensive to insist on holding onto power for another six-year 
term through Zedillo or any other person than for Salinas and 
the neoliberal group to keep themselves in power. [sentence as 
published] This would create another government option and 
provide a waiting period to meet the demands of justice, if 
fulfilled, and democracy, or at least give a clear sign of 
democracy. 
  The only way to avoid war is to mobilize the people before 
21 
August and pass the democratic test on 21 or 22 August, when the 
electoral process is decided. That is the only possibility we 
see. With that knowledge, we could have kept our mouths shut. 
We could have waited for what we saw in the underground world 
with which we are in contact. 
  This country's underground, in which we find ourselves, is 
not small; it is very large. It extends throughout the national 
territory. We could have done that and said: Well, we know we 
have the strength and the moral authority, and we are already 
spread throughout the country. We could have waited for this to 
blow up and capitalize on it according to our best interests. 
When the EZLN says NO, it is assuming its historic duty or its 
commitment to the nation to warn it once again that this is 
going to happen and something needs to be done. The advantage 
is that now, we are warning them before the war breaks out so 
there will not be a reoccurence of the January events. Then we 
would have to say we knew what was going to happen and did 
nothing to avoid it. Now you know what is going to happen and 
you can prevent it by doing the only thing possible; that is, 
forcing the government to withdraw and install a transition 
administration.

<F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>
  [Text] Appearing before the special commission evaluating 
the Military Code proposal on 17 June, Dr. Vilma Nunez, 
president of the Nicaraguan Human Rights Center, Cenidh, made 
valuable suggestions on the Military Code bill proposal as 
relates to responsibilities, military jurisdiction, and military 
social security. 
  Dr. Nunez proposes that no relative -- fourth degree of 
consanguinity and second of affinity -- of the president, vice 
president, or National Assembly president be appointed Armed 
Forces chief. 
  Dr. Nunez stated that "to keep civilian and military power 
from being concentrated in one family, we recommend adoption of 
the exclusions we just mentioned." 
  The Cenidh representative expressed her concern over "the 
broad and ambiguous" responsibilities given to the Army with the 
purpose of "maintaining institutional stability," 
responsibilities which clearly belong to the police. 
  Nunez expressed her opposition to Army involvement in 
actions 
to "reestablish order" as relates to labor or social conflicts. 
As an example, she pointed to the Sebaco events when several 
casualties resulted from the Armed Forces' methods. 
  "In no case can the president of the Republic declare an 
incident to be a mutiny, coup, or so forth and then proceed to 
mobilize the Army. That is a power of the judicial branch," 
Nunez warned. 
  With respect to the president's power to order Nicaraguan 
troops to leave the country or to allow foreign troops to enter 
national territory, Dr. Nunez recalled the mercenaries going 
through Puerto Cabezas on their way to the Bay of Pigs invasion 
in Cuba. 
  The code must be modified so the president proposes but the 
National Assembly authorizes. 
  On this issue, Dr. Nunez agrees with other experts who 
believe the Constitution should have been reformed first and the 
Military Code approved afterward. 
  The Cenidh also expressed opposition to including the 
Information Directorate for the Defense (DID) as part of the 
Armed Forces' structure. 
  Nunez warned that such actions "grant the Armed Forces a 
level of authority that is not theirs and which is contrary to 
their very nature. It encroaches upon the authority of the 
police force as the institution responsible for crime prevention 
and institutionalizes espionage to a dangerous degree." 
  In the area of penal jurisdiction, the Cenidh is opposed to 
placing the military justice structure under the chief judge 
advocate, as that office is subordinate to the Army General 
Command. 
  The attorney said that "it must be immediately established 
that all Armed Forces members charged of committing a common 
crime are to be turned over to the civilian justice system." 
  Regarding social provisions, the Cenidh says this must be 
accomplished "in accordance with the Constitution and the laws 
governing the state's administrative functions." 
  The Cenidh proposed drafting a regulatory system for 
providing social security benefits to Armed Forces members and 
their families. 
  Deputy Government Minister Frank Cesar and Deputy Police 
Chief Eduardo Cuadra also appeared before the commission. The 
extent of their participation regarding military justice was to 
request that the police be allowed to go before the judge 
advocate to have that person decide what justice system should 
handle specific crimes committed by policemen. 
  During the hearings, about 200 Liberal Constitutionalist 
Party activists protested outside the National Assembly building 
to demand that the Military Code be rejected.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Summit of Naiveties"] </F>
  [Text] The Cartagena de Indias summit, the fourth of its 
type in the past few years, concluded uneventfully, as can be 
said of events that do not have very much importance. The 
tournament of rhetoric could not even electrify the attention of 
analysts, as every paragraph is a reiterated condemnation of 
affairs, topics, and archaic turns of phrases that are already 
very well known. The ceremonial opening and closing sessions 
were what attracted the television cameras and photographers. 
If we had to mention something other than the ritual speeches 
by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, then we would have to say that Fidel Castro's 
stylized shirt was a general commentary on the meeting. Since 
just after the Sierra Maestra guerrillas entered Havana, he has 
never given up dressing in his green uniform. The Cuban 
dictator loped through the summit like a protagonist without a 
role. He was barely able to draft a paragraph in which he 
"bitterly" complained that the Final Declaration (approved by 
consensus) did not contain one line on the "American sanctions," 
a topic on which the Argentine foreign minister informally and 
correctly said that "Cuba is in a position to buy what it needs 
in Canada, Europe, and a large number of other countries." Of 
course, the Final Declaration contains chapters on "integration" 
in a hemisphere where words deny facts, and outlines its 
opposition to any kind of attempt to cause problems regarding 
trade links, transactions, and negotiations linked to 
production, exports, and exchange of products between the 
hemisphere's nations. Finally, it cannot but mention the 
Argentine president's move to propose that the Final Declaration 
contain a condemnation of the practice of abortion -- currently 
being promoted inappropriately by the United Nations -- a motion 
that regretably did not receive the hoped for effect. 
Nevertheless a valuable precedent remains: that in 
international forums our country defends the life that is about 
to be born, which is like saying that we are betting on the 
future.

<F P=106> [Interview with Armed Forces Commander General Fernando </F>
Sanjines Yanez by unidentified reporter; date and place not 
given] 
  [Excerpt] [PRESENCIA] What is the Armed Forces' concept of 
democracy? 
  [Sanjines] That it is important, necessary, and good for the 
country. This is why we should have it and keep it. Under this 
concept the Armed Forces will always be subordinated as a 
disciplined military organization and organized through a 
vertical structure in accordance with the Constitution, which 
entrusted us with the mission that must be fulfilled. 
  Sometimes it is difficult to satisfy every expectation 
within 
and outside the institution. Like all institutions, we are 
currently basically affected by the economic situation, and we 
must adjust to what is available, to the conditions of the 
country. 
  We have thus drawn up the Initial Concept Plan which 
basically means that the budget, which is allocated by the 
state, must be used by the Armed Forces to modernize and improve 
their operational capabilities and to carry out the assigned 
mission which has two parts: To defend sovereignty and to help 
the country's development. 
  The Initial Concept Plan is a document that will be 
distributed by the Central Command to the Armed Forces 
commanders once the government's basic plan has been settled, 
taking into account the guidelines of the commander in chief of 
the Armed Forces on foreign relations, domestic relations, etc. 
  This document was issued last January, and there has now 
been 
time to discuss it and to devise the best method of action, as 
is called in the general staff. Orders will soon be issued to 
the commanders to make the required changes on matters related 
to operations, personnel, and material, etc. 
  [PRESENCIA] In general terms, what is the Initial Concept 
Plan? 
  [Sanjines] It is a logical reorganization of the Armed 
Forces 
equipment and other resources. I believe we expanded too much, 
and our budget does not allow us to cover that expansion. 
  We have tried to improve some units and to strengthen others 
to be more effective because they may not carrying out a logic, 
positive action. 
  We want to improve the social aspect within the Armed 
Forces, 
to improve the life of officers, noncommissioned officers, and 
soldiers. 
  This is not easy because we have expanded too much. In other 
words, sometimes we created units where we should not, where our 
logistical needs were great and not well taken care of. There 
was maybe no need to create those units. 
  We want a more coherent situation within the institution. In 
the past the Armed Forces bought things that were not really 
needed. We must now adjust to a new situation. If we have to 
sell some of those superfluous things, we will do it. We are 
trying to be more realistic. 
  [PRESENCIA] Does this means personnel reduction? 
  [Sanjines] No, this does not mean reducing personnel. We are 
adjusting things. Sometimes useless spending is approved, for 
things that are not needed. For example, there is no need in 
the Air Force to have a special type of computer in a unit that 
will make no good use of it, but there is a need in the Air 
Force for communication equipment for planes. This is the type 
of change we want to make. 
  The same idea applies to the Army. There are places where 
personnel were increased, but they were not very effective 
operationally (not for lack of know-how but for lack of budget). 
Some units should control their personnel, but are unable 
through a lack of effective communications system. If we lack 
an effective communications system, why should we have a 
division that has no control over the units dispersed over a 
wide area? This is what we are doing. 
  [PRESENCIA] What does support for the development of the 
country means? 
  [Sanjines] The Armed Forces have supported the country's 
development for a long time, but we were unable to explain this 
to society because we are not experts on this matter and also 
because the Armed Forces do things anonymously, the way it 
should be done. This was lacking; for many years society did not 
receive a clear image on this aspect of the Armed Forces. 
  We continue to support the country with the same 
trustworthiness of the past, but perhaps in a more organized 
manner. 
  Education particularly pleases us, because in addition to 
training a soldier, we are also giving him a technical education 
so that when he returns to his community he can teach others how 
to improve agriculture, how to protect the environment and so on 
.... We carry out several activities which, beyond just the 
military training of handling weapons, also teach a soldier do 
that type of work. 
  [PRESENCIA] The Constitution says military men cannot become 
a deliberating body. Do you agree with that concept? 
  [Sanjines] Yes, I believe it is important. Yet this does not 
mean military officers cannot have political views like anybody 
else. Obviously our echelon of command, our regulations, 
foresee that when views emerge, they can be made known to a 
superior in a military unit, in meetings with a commander. This 
is how ideas reach the high command. The commander then conveys 
these ideas to the president who should know about them. It 
would be unprofessional for a military officer to issue his own 
personal opinions. 
  [PRESENCIA] Have the Armed Forces made any suggestions for 
the constitutional reform? 
  [Sanjines] Yes, we have worked in some seminars, but I don't 
want to get into this issue ... 
  [PRESENCIA] What is the meaning of sovereignty for Bolivians 
at the end of the millennium? 
  [Sanjines] It means having a real participation in the 
international community. Without it the factors of sovereignty 
would be weakened. 
  If we continue to be dependent, we continue to be 
vulnerable. 
I believe the country should begin to develop and work on a 
stronger national character without seeking divisions. Major 
disagreements should end. 
  I believe national unity should be achieved first in order 
to 
demand more work from everyone based on that achievement. We 
must all work much harder. It is not enough to work eight hours 
a day for the next five or ten years, we should work at least 
two more hours a day. If we do that we will strengthen our 
sovereignty. 
  [PRESENCIA] Regarding strategies, when we talk about 
borders, 
are there any threats ahead? 
  [Sanjines] One never knows how the world will react in the 
next five or 10 years, how regions, countries will react. 
  What we know for sure is that as time passes needs become 
greater, and in the face of those needs the countries will try 
to satisfy them. We must bear that in mind, that we are the 
only ones who will defend what is ours. This is why we must 
make long-range plans which means thinking about a national 
doctrine. 
  [PRESENCIA] Is the doctrine being drawn up? 
  [Sanjines] Yes, we are working on a joint doctrine because 
we 
haven't had one for a long time. In some way this is a 
criticism. We in the military wasted our time on other matters 
outside the Armed Forces. Perhaps there was a time when 
everyone was thinking of the government either for personal 
reasons or for lack of political leadership. We should have 
learned from the Chaco War experience and turn our entire 
attention to the Armed Forces. As military men we should seek 
to improve the doctrine and have something well defined. It is 
never too late, we are involved in it, and I believe it is 
important for the country to define a doctrine. 
  [PRESENCIA] How do the Armed Forces view the demand for 
decentralization? 
  [Sanjines] This issue should also be handled with great 
care. 
We are the protectors of national unity and on this issue we 
want to be very clear: We are concerned about a total 
decentralization. We recommend that decentralization should be 
just administrative, or we could reach a situation no one wants.

<F P=106> [First of three installments of an interview with </F>
Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army, 
by Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona jungle; date not given; 
first four paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction] 
  [Text] If in the course of the coming two months there is 
not a real democratic opening, Mexico will face an imminent 
general war, Subcommander Marcos warned in an interview. "What 
we are doing is opening a waiting period and appealing to 
civilian society, to its most representative sectors, to stage a 
civil mobilization, virtually as the last call to initiate a 
peaceful transition to democracy." 
  For the Zapatist leader, the "government's myopia" does not 
allow it to see that "there are armed groups in several parts of 
the republic" which are growing. He says that one way or 
another, the outbreak of what would be a civil war is imminent, 
"not a war between two armies, but a war among many armies." He 
added that the only way to stop it is to provide a truly 
democratic opening, which "is still possible today." 
  Subcommander Marcos affirmed that the historic 
responsibility 
for this war falls on the government for having refused to face 
this political crisis by providing the possibility of having a 
peaceful transition to democracy. 
  The following is the first of a three-part interview from 
the 
Lacandona Jungle: 
  [Ibarra] Subcommander, you rejected the government's 
proposals. What remains to be done now? 
  [Marcos] What we are doing is reviewing what happened after 
the dialogue, respecting the government's decision to provide a 
democratic opening, and to fulfill the EZLN's [Zapatist National 
Liberation Army] demands for justice. What we did was to engage 
in consultations and establish contacts with other social 
groups, which insisted that the EZLN's demands were not being 
fulfilled in the rest of the country or in the rest of the State 
of Chiapas. 
  What we are doing is opening a new waiting period and 
appealing to civilian society, to its most representative 
sectors, to conduct a civil mobilization, virtually as the last 
opportunity or the last call to initiate a peaceful transition 
to democracy. What we envision and what the government's myopia 
does not allow it to see is that the problem of refusing to 
permit the transition to democracy is not an EZLN problem. What 
I mean is that the government was betting that if it did not 
wipe out the EZLN, it would sign a peace agreement and this 
would eliminate the possibility of war. We know, however, that 
there are armed groups in several parts of the republic, which 
the political climate is causing to grow and which one way or 
another will lead to an outbreak. The only way to stop this is 
to yield before that happens and to provide a truly democratic 
opening. 
  [Ibarra] According to you, we are facing an imminent general 
war in Mexico? 
  [Marcos] Definitely. What we think is that an effort 
beforehand toward a peaceful transition is still possible, or at 
least a transition through the electoral path in August. If we 
insist on that, if society is mobilized sufficiently, although 
there is hardly enough calendar time from now till 21 August, if 
the mobilization is given, it could be very intense in historic 
terms. What we are trying to make the nation understand is that 
an imminent war, following the failure of a peaceful path toward 
democracy, does not depend on us. Other groups will rise up. 
There is not going to be any control. It will be what is 
called a civil war, not a war between two armies, but a war 
among many armies. It will become impossible to speak to 
anyone. There will be no mediators and this will create 
problems for everyone, for all the belligerent parties. 
  [Ibarra] Are you not, however, contributing to this outbreak 
with your no? 
  [Marcos] No, what we are doing is what we did on 1 January, 
warn the people of a situation. When we say no, we are again 
revealing the masquerade that prevails in this country, which 
would have been consolidated had we accepted the peace 
agreement. Efforts were made to make the people, including 
foreigners, believe that the problem had been resolved. Then 
the people would be surprised again by the outbreak of a civil 
war. What we are doing is maintaining the role we have had, 
alerting the people to what could happen in this country and not 
saying it. [sentence as published] 
  [Ibarra] We are not talking about a simple rejection. You 
have said no, and at the same time, you raise your demands; you 
demand President Salinas' resignation and even threaten him with 
a political trial. Is that correct? 
  [Marcos] Yes. We insist that history has again confirmed the 
justness of our demands. At the beginning, in January, when we 
demanded President Salinas' resignation, people thought we were 
crazy, but now they realize that what would be crazy would be 
letting him stay in power. All the subsequent incidents 
confirmed that no one is sitting in Los Pinos; there is no 
control over the country; there is a de facto ungovernability; 
and the figure of the federal executive branch is just that, a 
figure. One way or another many forces are loose within the 
group in power which, as a result of their internal struggle, 
are dragging the rest of the country with them. That is what we 
mean when we insist on the need for a transition government. 
There should be an agreement among those powerful groups to give 
the power to those who really should have it, in other words, to 
the people. 
  Those who, in January, believed we were crazy, in March, 
have 
realized that the others are the ones who are crazy. The 
federal executive branch's historical responsibility is refusing 
to deal with the situation of political crisis that began in 
January 1994 and is refusing to yield to the democratization 
drive, or at least permitting a regulated transfer, which is 
what a transition government does. Arrogance and disdain, 
however -- how can an Indian tell me I have to leave -- is what 
makes him cling to power, what makes him deceive the nation with 
a dialogue process disguised as negotiation to deceive the stock 
market, investors, and finally the United States and Canada 
because of NAFTA. 
  The lack of control in the rest of the country is also 
reflected in the internal group of power and leads to a series 
of internal adjustments, which causes so many problems. Salinas 
is responsible for that; therefore, he should finally resign and 
leave the presidency. He cannot leave with his hands clean or 
try to make people believe that his hands are clean if they are 
really dirty. Even if he resigns, he must be called to trial to 
explain to the nation why he acted the way he did; why he 
governed the way he did, or why he misgoverned the way he did at 
a crucial time in our country's history. The current federal 
government will be responsible should a civil war begin, with 
all its consequences. 
  [Ibarra] Until now, we have heard about the EZLN's presence 
in Chiapas. In one of your communiques, however, you issued 
orders to forces in the nation and abroad. What does that mean? 
  [Marcos] Well, this case is the same as the masquerade that 
was created in the sense that this was a local state problem to 
say the least, or even worse, reducing it to the four 
municipalities where it started. Anyone who commands a military 
institution, however, knows that no army deploys all its troops 
in its first move. It is clear that the EZLN only sent part of 
its forces into action on 1 January. It must have other forces 
in reserve. Moreover, it is clear that the banner the EZLN 
raises is beginning to receive support from other sectors, other 
groups, even clandestine groups, that in one way or another are 
joining the EZLN's struggle and accepting its military 
direction, both in other parts of the country and in other 
nations. 
  Therefore, we are addressing them to let them know what our 
no means, to let them know that we have not accepted the 
proposed agreements, that we have not surrendered. At the same 
time, to let them know that we have left a space open to permit 
the organization of civilian society or to let them express 
their discontent through peaceful means. On the other hand, we 
again addressed the nation to insist that trying to reduce the 
problem to the State of Chiapas is deceitful. We want to stress 
once again that we have a national problem here, a problem of 
national war, which is now facing three possibilities: the path 
of a peaceful or political solution, of transition to democracy; 
second, a regular war between regular armies, which is why the 
EZLN insists on its recognition as a belligerent force; and 
third, which would be the worst solution, a civil war, with many 
heads or without any head, with many forces fighting among 
themselves, without any clear division between each one, between 
one contender and another. We are warning the nation about that 
possibility. We are pointing out a reality: that we are a 
national army, that we exist throughout the nation, and that we 
can carry out military operations throughout the national 
territory and in some other places abroad. 
  [Ibarra] Do you think you stand a chance of victory even 
though you have only a few weapons? 
  [Marcos] In military terms, there are three variables: land, 
climate, and morale. A well-equipped, well-armed, and 
well-trained army that has problems with climate and morale can 
be defeated by an ill-equipped army that has the advantage in 
terms of land, climate, and morale. The way the Zapatist Army 
has been growing -- they may deceive themselves into thinking it 
has only occurred in this state -- shows a line of military 
progression. The EZLN is growing and establishing itself in the 
natural surroundings of its troops. That means the EZLN has 
already gone through what would be the acclimatization period 
for any regular army, and troops are joining the EZLN in its own 
territory. We do not think we stand a chance of defeating the 
federal Army militarily, but we do believe we can resist an 
all-out offensive for a long time, and that includes all the 
known military options, from the surgical strike to razing the 
civilian population. One way or another, the government -- and 
foreign countries as well -- must realize that if war begins, a 
regular war between two perfectly defined armies at best, they 
must be prepared to wage a lengthy war lasting many years, where 
the land and climate will be major factors in favor of the EZLN. 
Whether they like it or not, the federal Army will have to act 
as an occupation army. 
  [Ibarra] Are there any options to war? 
  [Marcos] The only option would be for society to stage a 
mobilization prior to the elections. Then the cost estimates 
done by government and Pentagon computers would show it is more 
expensive to insist on holding onto power for another six-year 
term through Zedillo or any other person than for Salinas and 
the neoliberal group to keep themselves in power. [sentence as 
published] This would create another government option and 
provide a waiting period to meet the demands of justice, if 
fulfilled, and democracy, or at least give a clear sign of 
democracy. 
  The only way to avoid war is to mobilize the people before 
21 
August and pass the democratic test on 21 or 22 August, when the 
electoral process is decided. That is the only possibility we 
see. With that knowledge, we could have kept our mouths shut. 
We could have waited for what we saw in the underground world 
with which we are in contact. 
  This country's underground, in which we find ourselves, is 
not small; it is very large. It extends throughout the national 
territory. We could have done that and said: Well, we know we 
have the strength and the moral authority, and we are already 
spread throughout the country. We could have waited for this to 
blow up and capitalize on it according to our best interests. 
When the EZLN says NO, it is assuming its historic duty or its 
commitment to the nation to warn it once again that this is 
going to happen and something needs to be done. The advantage 
is that now, we are warning them before the war breaks out so 
there will not be a reoccurence of the January events. Then we 
would have to say we knew what was going to happen and did 
nothing to avoid it. Now you know what is going to happen and 
you can prevent it by doing the only thing possible; that is, 
forcing the government to withdraw and install a transition 
administration.

  [Text] Quito, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto 
Duran Ballen today decreed a national state of emergency after 
the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) 
rejected a proposal to create a joint commission to draft a Land 
Development Law reforms package. Just before the official 
suspension of constitutional rights, the president had said "the 
situation in several cities was no longer bearable." 
  Peasant and Indian demonstrations began on 13 June, right 
after President Duran Ballen signed the new land law into 
effect. The demonstrators erected roadblocks on many of the 
countries roads and highways, looted businesses in several 
cities, and clashed with authorities resulting in at least three 
Indians dead and a dozen wounded. 
  During a meeting between Duran Ballen and Conaie leaders on 
Monday, the president said he would not repeal the law. Instead 
he proposed the formation of a joint commission to reform the 
law and to draw up the regulations that will govern its 
enforcement. The Indians, who make up about 30 to 50 percent of 
the country's total population of 10 million, finally rejected 
the proposals.

  [Text] Christine Stewart, Canada's minister of state for 
Latin America and Africa, supported Canada's investments in Cuba 
during her address to the conference organized by the British 
publication THE ECONOMIST in Havana. The conference, called the 
Second Round Table Conference With the Government in Havana, 
officially opens its two-day closed door meetings today, 21 
June. The conference was inaugurated by Carlos Lage, vice 
president of the council of ministers, Christine Stewart, and an 
executive of the sponsoring publication. 
  Stewart stressed that Canada's government supports an 
increase in investments in Cuba, not only because they 
contribute to Cuba's development but because they are beneficial 
to Canada. 
  Currently, Canada has a significant presence in the foreign 
investments made in the Cuban mining sector, not only in the 
traditional nickel sector but also in the new explorations for 
gold, lead, and copper, as well as in the operation of oil 
fields. Stewart expressed Canada's readiness to stimulate, even 
more, the influx of capital to Cuba. 
  Ottawa announced that it will aid in the development of 
Cuba, 
as well as through the World Food Program, sending an emergency 
$360,000 [country of currency not specified] -- $720,000 in 1995 
-- in food aid to Cuba.

  [Text] The Canadian Government is resuming humanitarian aid 
to Cuba, as well as aid for development, by donating $1,000,000 
[currency not specified]. Basically, this aid consists of the 
shipping of food by Canadian nongovernment organizations 
authorized by the government in Ottawa. 
  (Eduardo Delbueno), speaker for the Canadian Ministry of 
Foreign Relations commented on the aid to the BBC. 
  [Begin (Delbueno) recording in progress] ...Canada heard, 
and 
this is the right moment [words indistinct] new government 
[words indistinct] current politics is different [passage 
indistinct]. [end recording] 
  Commercial circles in Canada believe the commercial ventures 
between Canada and Cuba are positive. Approximately 120,000 
Canadian tourists per year visit Cuban beaches, and in 1992, 
Canada reached nearly $140,000,000 [country of currency not 
specified] in exports to Cuba. 
  (Elizabeth Steamhurt), assistant to the Canadian 
nongovernment aid organizations for America, provided more 
details on the status of the commercial exchange between Cuba 
and Canada during her talk to the BBC: 
  [Begin (Steamhurt) recording] I believe it is true that this 
has to do with the decision because, in fact, Canada has 
important enough economic joint ventures with Cuba, especially 
for the Cuban [words indistinct]. I have some numbers here 
pointing out that in 1992, Canada exported nearly 140 million 
Canadian dollars worth of goods to Cuba, this includes wheat, 
paper, corn and telecommunications equipment. And from Cuba, we 
imported sugar, seafood, clothing and tobacco, among other 
goods. So, let us say that the economic exchange with Canada is 
not necessarily enormous, but it has significance in the current 
economic crisis in Cuba, in this context it is important for 
Cuba [words indistinct]. [end recording]

  [Text] Santiago de Chile, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Negotiations 
between Chile and Cuba regarding the eight Cuban citizens who 
continue to occupy the Chilean General Consulate in Havana, 
since last Wednesday, are "deadlocked." Jose Miguel Insulza, 
Chilean deputy minister of foreign relations, reported today 
that there has been no progress in the talks. 
  The Chilean diplomat said "we have no news, good or bad. The 
same eight people are still there." He added that the "guests" 
would be staying indefinitely. 
  He recalled that the Cuban Government has stated that those 
entering consulates or embassies will not be allowed a visa to 
leave the country. Meanwhile, the refugees have reaffirmed that 
they do not plan to leave the Chilean consular building. 
  "The Chilean Government is flexible. It is ready to 
negotiate with Cuban authorities, to reach certain guarantees 
with the government and to find a peaceful resolution of the 
situation," announced Deputy Minister Insulza. 
  He added that the Chilean consulate in Havana is ready to 
study the requests for emigration to Chile; each of its "guests" 
may file, provided the Cuban Government allows them to leave. 
  Chile decided to receive the Cuban refugees for 
"humanitarian 
reasons." All of the refugees are under 30 years of age, 
including a woman and a 12 year-old boy. 
  Last month, groups of Cubans entered the Belgian and German 
embassies in Havana. Chile and Cuba have not shared full 
diplomatic relations since the 11 September 1973 coup d'etat. 
Consular relations were reestablished in 1991.

<F P=106> ["Text" of editorial appearing in 21 June edition of GRANMA: </F>
"The Only Option for Embassy Invaders: Unconditionally Leave the 
Same Way You Entered;" read by Alfredo Forte from the 
"National Radio News"] 
  [Text] A few more than 100 people have been guests of the 
Belgian and German Embassies and the Chilean Consulate for many 
days. They want to travel through those countries to reach 
their final destination: the United States. Various U.S. 
Administrations have used different methods to encourage 
desertions during our people's long struggle and have proclaimed 
with fanfare the need to exterminate the bad example Cuba has 
set on this continent. 
  Encouragement for illegal escapes and forced entries into 
diplomatic missions has increased recently, almost in geometric 
proportion to the increasing solidarity Cuba has awakened in the 
civilized world due to its unwavering position in the face of an 
aggressive and clumsy policy. Seeking to propitiate the 
occurrence of these irresponsible actions, visas are 
systematically denied to those who want to emigrate; immigration 
accords are not fulfilled; and, while legal obstacles increase, 
the coasts are kept open to welcome, with ample media coverage, 
those who manage to survive this odyssey. 
  Quite a few in Miami have established a lucrative business 
by 
trafficking in human beings. Our people are convinced that if 
the goals were truly humanitarian, visas would simply be given 
to everyone who requested one, illegal arrivals onto the 
territory would be banned, and opportunities would be given to 
those who want to live in the promised land. It, however, is a 
promised land rather than a granted land, except with the risk 
of one's life. Such is the case of those now occupying the 
three diplomatic missions. Our intention is not to offend 
anyone who wants to emigrate. While we respect the people's 
right to live wherever they want, we will let no one swindle us 
into granting nonexistent categories to people who simply 
immigrate for personal reasons, family reasons, or economic 
reasons or simply for adventure. That is going too far. 
  The Belgian hotel's guests include 34 people who have been 
warned about markedly antisocial behavior and 25 others who have 
been prosecuted for common crimes, including breaking and 
entering -- an experience that undoubtedly facilitated the task 
of breaking into the diplomatic missions. A total of 25 
children -- including the world's youngest political refugee, 
who is only a few months old -- were dragged into an adventure 
that could only have one ending. Oblivious of the drama in which 
their impulsive parents forced them to participate, they face 
food problems and live in extremely close quarters. The most 
critical thing is that once the alleged political refugees 
illegally and disrespectfully entered the Belgian ambassador's 
residence, they used the facilities to establish an alleged 
organization, distribute propaganda, and display signs under the 
Belgian mission's roof. 
  We must remember that diplomatic missions cannot be used as 
centers for political activities against the host country 
because this violates the functions for which they are 
accredited. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted in a 
responsible way by instructing its ambassador to notify his 
guests about the nature of the illegal action they have 
perpetrated because it violates that country's territory and 
Cuban laws, and to ask them to abstain from carrying out 
provocative acts in his garden. 
  We must note that our guards were calm. Their composure 
prevented injuries even when their lives were in danger. A 
total of 46 of the occupants have already abandoned the 
facilities and are home. We must explain that whoever is guilty 
of a crime before or during the action of violently entering an 
embassy will have to answer for this. For example, the 
criminals who stole a truck and damaged state property by 
crashing through the German Embassy's gate will have to answer 
to the authorities -- not because of the illegal entry, because 
we have given guarantees both to Belgium and Germany on this 
occasion as a gesture of goodwill toward their governments. 
These guarantees, however, do not include immunity for other 
crimes. To exonerate the criminals would encourage them to break 
into diplomatic missions. Some of them are repeat offenders, 
and this is simply inadmissible. 
  Cuba knows that most of the diplomatic corps accredited to 
our country understand and coincide with our government's 
position, and they cooperate in this concern. This is the time 
to underscore our staunch principle: Absolutely no one who 
enters a diplomatic mission by force will be authorized to leave 
the country either now or later. This is a nonnegotiable 
position, and we will not give in under any circumstances. It 
would be easy for Cuba to expedite the way for those who opt to 
enter the embassies. Who would pay the consequences? Who would 
be left at the mercy of any intruder who violates the immunity 
of his territory with the intention of emigrating? What would 
be the position of the governments of these countries if 
Haitians who are now repatriated en masse preferred to break 
into their diplomatic missions? What if, instead of risking 
their lives at a border bristling with rifles to hunt them down, 
Mexican wetbacks opted to jump the walls at the European or 
Latin American missions in Mexico City? Cuba has a 
responsibility to protect diplomatic missions. It is dutybound 
to protect the immunity and inviolability of their territories, 
and it will strictly fulfill its duty. 
  The experience derived from over three decades of 
withstanding blackmail, a blockade, and a direct and indirect 
aggression have taught us that we cannot give an inch. You lose 
every principle that you give up. That is the best guarantee 
for those who represent their countries in Cuba. It is always 
appropriate to ask: What is the purpose? Is it perhaps to 
establish this option as a legitimate way to leave the country? 
Inaugurate in Cuba a new style of getting documents to enter a 
country, a style different from the one which exists in other 
capitals? Artificially encourage a political situation for 
reasons that are suspiciously similar to the ones the United 
States is fruitlessly trying to create? Complicate things for 
our country during the recently concluded fourth Ibero-American 
summit in Cartagena de Indias? 
  We have yet to lose heart before powerful enemies. We have 
resisted despite adversity. We are not a nation that can be 
intimidated or put on the defendant's chair. It is time 
something is understood once and for all: Cuba does not admit 
pressure, regardless of where it comes from or who exerts the 
pressure. We were taught courage, and we learned the lesson 
well. We were taught unwavering principles, and we are good 
students. We were taught that the enemy cannot be given a 
single inch, and we are faithful disciples. Cuba is serene. 
Nothing clouds the clear conscience of a nation that has 
courageously faced difficult tests. Our Foreign Ministry has 
amply explained our revolutionary government's position. It is 
willing to fully cooperate with accredited diplomatic missions 
to solve their conflict and even prevent future problems in a 
sensible way. 
  The people who have sought asylum at the Belgian, German, 
and 
Chilean missions have only one option: To unconditionally leave 
the same way they entered.

  [Text] Lima, 21 June (EFE) -- Peruvian Foreign Minister 
Efrain Goldenberg reported today that, at the request of ousted 
Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide, Peru has withdrawn its 
recognition of Haitian Ambassador to Lima Roland Agustin. 
  The Peruvian foreign minister stated that Claudett Werleigh, 
Aristide's minister of foreign affairs and culture, while 
speaking on Aristide's behalf on 14 June in Washington, asked 
Peru to withdraw Agustin's recognition. 
  Goldenberg said: "Out of respect for a democratically 
elected 
government, which is the only government we recognize in Haiti, 
we have decided not to recognize Mr. Roland Agustin's 
ambassadorial status." 
  This decision averted criticism by the opposition against 
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori who rejected the idea of 
military intervention in Haiti or Cuba during the recent 
Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. The 
opposition accused Fujimori of defending the Haitian military 
regime headed by General Raoul Cedras "in view of his 
authoritarian convictions." 
  Goldenberg added that Fujimori's position, and that of his 
administration, is based "on the principle of self-determination 
of countries." Goldenberg said Peru supports a political and 
peaceful solution to the Haitian issue and supports the measures 
approved by the OAS and the United Nations. 
  Regarding the criticism surrounding Fujimori's recent trip 
to 
Beijing, Goldenberg said Peru believes China has great potential 
for Peruvian economic and commercial interests. He added that 
"China is not a political model for Peru." Goldenberg stated: 
"With all due respect, the Chinese political model is not an 
example for us because we are in a different situation."

  [Text] How was the Tocantins ranch, where Latin America's 
largest cocaine shipment was discovered a few weeks ago, 
purchased? This question prompted the Brazilian Federal Police 
to conduct further investigations. Following these 
investigations, the possibility arose that Ciudad del Este was 
the Cali Cartel mafiosi's base of operations for laundering 
money. 
  An AP report datelined Rio de Janeiro notes that the 
unprecedented seizure of 7.5 metric tons of cocaine in early 
June allowed the discovery of a money laundering network of the 
Cali Cartel, a Colombian drug trafficking ring. 
  Police chief Antonio Borges reported that the criminal 
organization used bank accounts in New York, Paraguay, and 
Brazil to transfer money and invest in the Brazilian drug 
trafficking market for storing and exporting cocaine. 
<H5>  The Lebanese </H5>
  After the details of the seizure operation became available, 
Nasrat Mohamed Jamil, a Lebanese-Brazilian citizen who had 
established covert businesses in Ciudad del Este, became the 
main target in unraveling the mafia's tentacles. He had been 
living in Foz do Iguacu (where he was detained on the eve of the 
operation carried out in the aforementioned Brazilian state) 
after his separation two years ago from Vera Lucia Minikoski, 
who had filed a petition with the Parana State courts to divide 
their common property, demanding about $20 million. 
  According to Borges, Jamil was the drug trafficking ring's 
treasurer for the Cali Cartel's complicated money transfers in 
Brazil, where one of its lords, Vicente Wilson Rivera Ramos, had 
established himself. Rivera Ramos, along with another 11 people, 
was arrested for allegedly trafficking in cocaine to the United 
States. 
<H5>  Colombia-United States-Paraguay </H5>
  The police chief added that the drug money was remitted from 
Colombia to two banks in New York, and from New York to the Cali 
Cartel's base of financial operations in Ciudad del Este. The 
funds were withdrawn in cash and deposited in a bank in Foz do 
Iguacu, from where they were transferred to various accounts in 
various Brazilian cities under false names.

  [Text] According to Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli 
Rivas, the election of a new Colombian president will not change 
relations between Venezuela and Colombia. 
  Burelli has said Venezuela is quite pleased with the results 
of the Colombian election in which Liberal Party candidate 
Ernesto Samper was elected president. 
  The foreign minister said the fact that the marine and 
submarine area delimitation issue in the Gulf of Venezuela had 
not been discussed as part of the election campaign is a very 
encouraging sign for bilateral relations. 
  The new Colombian president, Ernesto Samper, will take 
office 
on 7 August.

  [Excerpts] On 12 June, President Luis Alberto Lacalle said 
the incorporation of Chile into Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South] would give momentum to this drive for integration. He 
added, however, that Chile would have to abide by Mercosur 
rules. [passage omitted] 
  Lacalle said: "We consider Mercosur to be the most 
significant undertaking in the River Plate area since our 
countries' independence. It is a key factor for bringing about 
change. Yet Mercosur has its own rules." 
  On 8 June, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa handed 
to 
his Argentine counterpart Guido Di Tella an official proposal on 
behalf of his country for joining Mercosur. 
  Argentina at present holds the presidency pro tempore of 
Mercosur, and it is incumbent upon that country to officially 
inform Paraguay, Brazil, and Uruguay of Chile's intention to 
join Mercosur. 
  Uruguay has so far been reluctant to accept a new partner in 
Mercosur before its current members consolidate this free trade 
zone, which will become effective at the end of the year. 
  Mercosur is, moreover, in the throes of establishing a 
common 
external tariff, which will reportedly range between 0 and 20 
percent. 
  Chile has set a tariff ceiling of 10 percent, which in 
principle precludes it from joining Mercosur. 
  High-ranking sources close to the Foreign Ministry told EL 
PAIS that Chile's possible incorporation into Mercosur will be 
discussed by the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI) 
within the framework of the Brazilian proposal to establish a 
South American Free Trade Area. [passage omitted]

countries pirating software, but it is among those that do the 
most copying. Last year it failed to bill $572 million for 
computer programs, and the use of pirated programs totaled 83 
percent. Those figures are from the Business Software Alliance 
(BSA), an international body that combats the illegal use of 
programs. It is estimated that $12.8 billion in software was not 
billed throughout the world in 1993 because of "piracy."

  There are many countries where more than 90 percent of the 
software in use has been copied. Among them are Poland (94 
percent), the Russian Federation (98 percent), Indonesia (99 
percent), China (94 percent), Thailand (99 percent), Egypt (93 
percent), the United Arab Emirates (99 percent), Bolivia (96 
percent), Peru (98 percent), and Paraguay (94 percent). The 
Asians take first place in the piracy ranking, according to the 
BSA. 
  The countries where the least copying is done are Austria 
(42 
percent), Switzerland (44 percent), Australia (47 percent), 
South Africa (45 percent), and the United States (35 percent). 
Although the United States ranks among the lowest, it is also 
the country that loses the most money because of copying. It 
fails to bill $2.25 billion and is followed by Japan (80 
percent) at $1.58 billion. In the most highly developed European 
countries, the rate of copying averages from 50 to 60 percent.

  [Excerpts] The latest poll by Gallup Institute was 
conducted between 4 and 15 June. It was conducted exclusively 
for O ESTADO. It reveals that if the presidential elections were 
held today, there would be a runoff election. Those polled were 
shown the list of candidates. PT [Workers Party] candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] 
candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso received 37.9 and 22.8 
percent, respectively, of the votes. This shows that they would 
have to participate in a runoff election. 
  These percentages for the two main candidates are very 
similar to the ones in the previous poll. Compared to last 
month's poll, the popularity of Lula and Cardoso dropped by 0.4 
and 0.7 percent, respectively. [passage omitted] 
  As for the other candidates, Leonel Brizola obtained 7.6 
percent, Orestes Quercia received 6.8 percent, Esperidiao Amin 
received 2.5 percent, Eneas Carneiro received 2.0 percent, and 
Flavio Rocha received 1.1 percent. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Brazilian entrepreneurs fear a possible victory 
by presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva (PT) 
[Workers Party] in the elections. Nevertheless, they do not 
intend to divert their investments to foreign countries. 
  This is the main finding of a survey conducted on 6 June by 
Datafolha among 393 businessmen throughout the country. More 
than three of four of the businessmen polled (exactly 78 
percent) said the country will stand to lose if Lula is 
successful at the polls. Yet a still more considerable number 
of entrepreneurs (83 percent) asserted that their companies will 
continue to invest in Brazil. 
  Showing consistency with the idea that Lula will be harmful 
for Brazil, businessmen even preferred Esperidiao Amin (PPR) 
[Progressive Renewal Party] to the PT candidate, even though the 
former comes only fifth in the electorate's choice as president. 
  PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] candidate Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso is, as expected, the favorite among 
entrepreneurs, obtaining the endorsement of 65 percent of 
businessmen. Amin comes in second with 5 percent. Only then 
does Lula come into the picture (4 percent) followed by 
Brazilian Democratic Movement Party candidate Orestes Quercia (3 
percent). [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Roberto Bardial] </F>
  [Text] Luis Paulo Rosenberg told PAGINA 12: "If Lula [Luiz 
Inacio da Silva] wins the October presidential elections he will 
probably impose a style of government that is nearer to Mexico 
than to Argentina. He will dedicate more money to social 
programs; he will slow down the privatization process; and he 
will open up the economy and maintain a social balance." 
Rosenberg wrote a document entitled: "The PT [Workers Party] In 
Government," which has lately become something of a best seller 
among Brazilian businessmen, executives, and industrialists. 
  The authors spent three months researching the subject and 
published only 500 issues of the document on 31 May. It has 40 
pages and it sells for $100 among powerful Sao Paulo 
businessmen. Wladimir Pomar, former Lula campaign manager 
during the 1989 presidential election and current PT dissident, 
is one of the authors. 
  Rosenberg currently directs a private consulting firm in Sao 
Paulo. He was one of the advisers of controversial former 
Economy Minister Delfim Netto, one of the gray eminences of the 
so-called "Brazilian miracle" during the military regime 
(1964-83). 
  PAGINA 12 has had access to the document. It is based on 
the assumption that PT leader "Lula" will probably be elected 
president in October. To charge $100 dollars for something that 
almost everybody knows seems a bit steep, especially in light of 
surveys which in the past months have given the PT candidate 
nearly 40 percent of the vote, the highest among all candidates 
seeking to get to the Planalto Palace in Brasilia. Rosenberg's 
work, however, summarizes the history of the PT since its 
foundation in 1978. It analyzes relations among its diverse 
internal factions and presents a biographical-political profile 
of its main leaders, which makes it a Who's Who [previous two 
words in English] of essential reading for those who believe the 
future is fraught with dark "red" forecasts. 
  The book explains that the organization include movements 
from a broad spectrum of political positions: liberals, 
Christian socialists, social democrats, revolutionary 
socialists, Trotskyites, and ultras, who are known as "Shiites" 
due to their fundamentalist radicalism. The document stresses, 
however, that "within Lula's pendular system of politics, the 
center holds the balance." 
  Regarding military reaction, Rosenberg rules out any 
possibility of unrest in the barracks if Lula wins. "The Armed 
Forces will not interfere in the electoral process," he 
categorically states. 
  The Sao Paulo consultant believes sociologist Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, the former economy minister and presidential 
candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), who is 
currently second in the surveys, also has "a very good chance." 
The document states that this is the case even though he "has 
no charisma and his political campaign is somewhat amateurish." 
Rosenberg assumes Cardoso's economic plan will lower inflation 
and stresses that "Brazilian gratitude toward anyone who reduced 
inflation from 45 percent a month to 3 percent is bound to be 
enormous." 
  Lula proposes a pact between the government, entrepreneurs, 
and workers to lower the inflation rate. His plan contemplates 
strong state intervention in the economy, changes within the 
financial system, and measures such as price control and a fight 
against oligopolies. 
  Rosenberg gives no chance to Orestes Quercia of the 
Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) or Leonel Brizola, former Rio 
de Janeiro State governor of the Democratic Workers Party (PDT), 
who are the other presidential candidates. Rosenberg says the 
former "is unparalleled in his political professionalism and is 
a born winner, but his past is so full of corruption charges." 
Rosenberg briefly describes Brizola as "an unburied corpse." 
  Political scientist Francisco Weffort, one of the most 
brilliant minds within the PT, has explained the new winds -- or 
rather, the new breeze -- blowing through the organization. 
Tactics have changed since the 1982 election when the PT 
campaign slogan was: "Vote for number three, the rest are 
bourgeoisie." Lula's ballot number was three. 
  "The PT currently has a more open alliance policy than in 
the 
past," Weffort says. The PT "under Lula seeks alliances with 
entrepreneurs and the middle class, although not exclusively. 
He has done a good job in overcoming the mistrust of 
entrepreneurs, but Fernando Henrique Cardoso has more weight 
with them." 
  Weffort gave an example: "Making alliances is not easy. It 
is like getting married. It is not enough for one side to want 
it, the other side must want it too." Weffort said the PT 
"always wanted an alliance with the PDT, but Brizola speaks out 
against Lula almost every day." Weffort does not rule out a 
possible approach to Fernando Henrique Cardoso's party. 
  This possibility is not so very far fetched (in fact, the 
closer the date of the election, the more far fetched is 
everything else in this country, which is filled with apparent 
irrational political attitudes). Edmar L. Bacha, economist, 
academician, author of the plan that seeks to rescue Brazil from 
its high inflationary process, and Cardoso's assistant during 
his administration at the Economy Ministry expressed himself in 
similar terms last March: "Lula cannot govern alone. He will 
have to seek alliances." To avoid any doubts, he added: "PT 
deputies are very responsible and highly trained people. It is 
true that the party has many radicals at the grassroots, but 
there is nothing to prevent what we call the light [preceding 
word in English] PT faction prevailing once Lula is in 
government." 
  Luis Inacio "Lula" da Silva usually listens to his advisers' 
proposals. The 21 members of the National Executive Committee 
participate in his campaign planning. Its most important 
members are: 

  -  Jose Graziano is an agronomist with a PhD from 
the University of London. He has listed the most serious 
problems that the PT must address. He carries a folder on 
important issues and advises the candidate on how to handle 
problems. 
  -  Ricardo Kotscho is a journalist. He is not a PT 
member; he is a public relations adviser. Those who know him 
well say he is "a propaganda producing machine" who specializes 
in special effects. 
  -  Wander Bruno do Prado is Lula's personal 
secretary. He organizes Lula's famous "caravans" throughout the 
country. He establishes the routes, the length, lunching 
places, hotels, and transportation 40 to 50 days in advance of 
each electoral tour. 
  -  Gilberto Carvalho is a former seminarist 
and employee of the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops. 
It is said that very few people know better what each important 
religious figure thinks in the country. He is a close friend of 
Lula but has less influence than those listed above. He is 
Lula's main contact with the Church. 
  -  Hamilton Pereira is a 
former guerrilla and former political prisoner. He takes care 
of the candidate's engagements agenda. He is a poet who won the 
House of the Americas' prize with poems he wrote while in jail.

<F P=106> [Article by Celso Pinto and Fernando Abrucio: "Surprises in </F>
`Who's Who' of PT Administration"] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo -- Aloizio Mercadante is regarded as the 
potential minister of finance in a PT [Workers Party] 
administration, but if he is appointed to that post, he will 
have to face strong opposition from within the party. For his 
part, economist Jorge Mattoso is not well-known to the public, 
but he has a good chance of occupying "a prominent position in 
the economic area in a probable Lula administration." 
  Precisely because of its assumption that a good many of its 
clients --important businessmen and bankers -- do not know about 
the PT's internal resistance to Mercadante or who Mattoso is, 
the Rosenberg Consultancy has prepared a report on what the PT's 
factions think and what its program is and listed the top people 
in the party. That "Who's Who" of the PT describes the 138 
prominent figures who are either in the party or close to it and 
assesses their chances for being part of a Lula administration. 
  Luiz Paulo Rosenberg, a former adviser to Delfim Netto (when 
the latter was minister of finance) and to former President Jose 
Sarney, takes a pragmatic view of the matter. Since there is a 
reasonable chance that Lula will be elected, he feels that it is 
time for businessmen to stop complaining about the PT and start 
getting better acquainted with the party and its people. 
  To help prepare his report, he hired Wladimir Pomar of the 
PT 
Executive Committee. Pomar, who was general coordinator of the 
PT's campaign in 1989 and is involved in the current campaign, 
is "ideologically a democratic socialist," according to the 
description in "Who's Who." The report's general assessment of 
the PT and its program is far from being apocalyptic. 
  Rosenberg personally is convinced that a Lula administration 
"will not be a disaster." He feels that Lula will be a 
combination of Argentine President Carlos Menem, although not as 
pragmatic, and Socialist French President Francois Mitterrand 
"in his doctrinaire stuffiness." In other words, he will end up 
adjusting pragmatically to reality and its limitations. "Lula is 
not another Alan Garcia," says Rosenberg, referring to the 
former Peruvian president whose populist policy led his country 
into bankruptcy. 
  The history of the PT and its internal disputes involves a 
tangle of acronyms, realignments, and breakups. The current 
picture as described in the report involves eight main groups: 
  1. Alliance (now called Alliance in Struggle), comprising 
30 percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, social 
democrats, democratic socialists, and pragmatics, it occupies 
the center-right in the party. 
  2. Leftist Alliance (now called Leftist Option): 23 
percent of the party. Uniting Christian socialists, democratic 
socialists, revolutionary socialists, and pragmatics, it 
combines the center and the center-left. 
  3. Socialist Democracy (now part of the Leftist Option): 
11 percent of the party. A combination of democratic socialists, 
revolutionary socialists, and Trotskyites, it is obviously 
further to the left. 
  4. Socialist Force (now part of the "In the PT Struggle" 
faction): 10 percent of the party. It comprises democratic 
socialists and revolutionary socialists. "In the PT Struggle" 
unites the factions further to the left and "Shiites." 
  5. Labor (of "In the PT Struggle"): 5 percent of the 
party. A combination of revolutionary socialists and Trotskyites. 
  6. Socialist Component ("In the PT Struggle"): 3 percent 
of the party. A combination of Christian socialists and 
revolutionary socialists. 
  7. Plan for Brazil (now called Radical Democracy): 11 
percent of the party. It unites neoliberals, social democrats, 
democratic socialists, Christian socialists, and pragmatics. 
Comprises the PT's right-wing groups. 
  8. Independents: 7 percent of the party. These are 
individuals or groups that have no ties with factions; they 
cover the entire spectrum from right to left in the party. 
  Anyone adding up the figures based on this picture will 
conclude that the Left predominates. But the report is more 
cautious. 
  "Looking at things realistically, Leftist Alliance and 
Socialist Democracy (grouped together in Leftist Option) 
represent the center and the center-left. They are the pendulum 
in the PT's political spectrum. By allying themselves with part 
of the "In the PT Struggle" movement, they are seeking basically 
to ensure their hegemony in the party machinery and prevent the 
former Alliance, with which they still have many points in 
common, from uniting with Radical Democracy completely and 
moving the PT all the way to the right. In practice, that center 
seems to be acting as the point of equilibrium preventing the 
"Shiite" wings from becoming a center of attraction for the 
party's rank and file -- something that was in fact happening as 
a result of the Alliance's move in the direction of Plan for 
Brazil (now called Radical Democracy)," says the report. 
  The report admits that that kind of reasoning is very 
different from the analysis usually found in the media, which 
are in the habit of describing the PT as a party dominated by 
the "Shiites." The report observes that presenting it in that 
way may be useful as a weapon in anti-PT propaganda but that it 
is also deceptive."This has probably done more to confuse the 
PT's opponents themselves, since those analyses are of little 
value if they are to be used in the strategic battle or if they 
are to serve as reference points in dialogue and negotiation," 
the report argues. 
  In its extensive analysis of the PT's platform, the report 
shows that on several points it is much more moderate and 
realistic than the 1989 platform. It represents a compromise 
among the various factions, which are currently divided on two 
issues: 1) the chief reforms that a PT administration should 
introduce, and 2) attitudes toward such controversial issues as 
agrarian reform, the role of the state, monopolies, 
privatization, inflation, foreign debt, an opening up to trade, 
foreign capital, fiscal and tax reforms, education, science and 
technology, and public policies. 
  As described in the report, the thinking of the Radical 
Democracy faction is to a large extent indistinguishable from 
that of the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party]. It wants to 
stabilize and modernize the economy, reduce state monopolies as 
much as possible, and privatize. It supports fiscal reform, 
favors rural settlements but opposes the invasion of property, 
and favors an opening up to the rest of the world (although with 
some control over foreign capital). Federal Deputy Jose Genoino 
belongs to this faction. 
  The Alliance faction is divided. Some of its members support 
Radical Democracy, while others want more thoroughgoing reforms. 
The Leftist Alliance wants a mass market. It also wants to 
change the profile of rural and urban production and preserve an 
important role for the state. The other factions polarize around 
leftist ideas. "Who's Who" has several surprises for anyone not 
familiar with the party. The report points out that Mercadante, 
for example, "is accused of being one of the current defenders 
of policies approaching neoliberalism on the issues of foreign 
capital, negotiation of the foreign debt, and stabilization 
policies, even though his stands on those issues are more 
complex." Hence the resistance that will arise in the party if 
Lula appoints him minister of finance. 
  Another of the PT's public stars in the economic area, 
Senator Eduardo Suplicy, is described in tough terms. "He has a 
great feel for creating political events and appearing in the 
media...and charisma in the eyes of part of the population. 
Despite that, his influence inside the PT is relative. He seems 
to have no preconceived ideas on the most controversial issues, 
but simply sticks to the middle way when it comes to opinions." 
He is not mentioned as a possible candidate for a post in Lula's 
administration. 
  Several of the individuals mentioned as possible occupants 
of 
important posts in the economic area do not come as a surprise: 
businessman Oded Grajew, who is involved in Lula's campaign; 
Professors Paul Singer and Francisco de Oliveira; Maria da 
Conceicao Tavares; and Paulo Nogueira Batista, Jr. (although not 
a member, he is often consulted by the party). Jose Marcio 
Camargo, an economics professor in Rio de Janeiro, and Jose 
Graziano da Silva, an agricultural expert, are likely to be 
members of a PT administration. 
  Several other individuals who are also prominently mentioned 
are much less familiar to the public. In the economic area, 
besides Jorge Mattoso, whom we have already mentioned, there is 
Cesar Benjamin, who is one of the coordinators of the party 
platform, a member of the Leftist Alliance faction, and one of 
the chief supporters of the introduction of a mass market. 
Another economist who is not well known to the public but who 
may be given a post is Carlos Eduardo Carvalho, coordinator of 
the 1989 platform. He is a "democratic socialist" who tends to 
side with the Leftist Alliance on tactical issues. 
  Marco Aurelio Garcia, a prominent adviser to Lula, is 
mentioned as the probable minister of foreign affairs. 
Geographer Aziz Ab'Saber may be a star in the area of the 
environment. Benedita da Silva and Herbert de Souza ("Betinho") 
may be important in the social area. Santos Mayor David 
Capistrano and Leoncio Feitosa (of the parallel government) may 
be given key positions in the Ministry of Health. 
  Luiz Soares Dulci of the Minas Gerais National Directorate 
and the Alliance faction "will probably be given an important 
post in a Lula administration." So will physicist Luiz Pinguelli 
Rosa and Prof. Emir Sader. Philosopher Leandro Konder is tipped 
for the cultural area, and journalist Perseu Abramo is seen in 
some sort of direct advisory capacity in the Office of the 
President. 
  Among the party's well-known politicians who may occupy 
federal posts, the following are mentioned, among others: Plinio 
de Arruda Sampaio, Jose Dirceu (if he loses the gubernatorial 
race in Sao Paulo), Rui Falcao, Jose Genoino, Luiz Gushiken, 
Jorge Bittar (if he loses the gubernatorial race in Rio de 
Janeiro), and Vladimir Palmeira. Also mentioned are jurists 
Dalmo Dallari, Fabio Konder Comparato, Raymundo Faoro, and Helio 
Bicudo. 
  If there is a PT administration, it will not only change the 
government radically but also cause a substantial increase in 
the size of businessmen's lists of telephone numbers. 
<H5>  "Plan Will Obstruct Future Administration" </H5>
  Sao Paulo -- The national president of the Workers Party 
(PT), Rui Falcao, said last Friday that "the big problem with 
the economic plan is that it may obstruct action by the future 
administration, especially if it causes a recession." When asked 
whether Lula's campaign managers were concerned about the 
benefits that the stabilization plan might have for presidential 
candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Falcao answered: "What we 
are concerned about are the perverse effects that introducing 
the real may have, particularly from the standpoint of 
unemployment." 
  But despite saying that the PT does not fear the 
stabilization plan's possible effects on the election, Falcao 
asserted that "this new plan is as much a vote-getting ploy as 
the Cruzado Plan was, and the fact that the real banknotes are 
being printed with Fernando Henrique's name on them is 
conclusive proof of that." 
  Falcao also said: "The government's economic plan would not 
be a vote-getting ploy only if structural reforms were included 
among its goals, which is what the PT is doing in its plan for 
government." 
  Among the structural reforms listed by Falcao, the most 
important are agrarian reform and employment. To deal with that 
last-named problem, the party has introduced the Plan for Impact 
on Unemployment under the coordination of Deputy Aloizio 
Mercadante. The PT's plan for combating unemployment will 
earmark $25 billion for promoting the creation of 8 million 
jobs. The money will come from the Social and Constitutional 
Funds and from budget allocations from the National Treasury, 
according to the Globo Agency. 
  The most important official topic at the meeting was the 
possibility of alliances in three states: Santa Catarina, 
Rondonia, and Bahia. In the case of Santa Catarina, the PT wants 
to support Senator Nelson Wedekin of the PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party], provided that PT members Milton Mendes de Oliveira and 
Luci Choinacki can run respectively for lieutenant governor and 
for one of the vacancies in the Senate. 
  In the case of Rondonia, the PT National Executive Committee 
decided by a vote of 10 to three to uphold the resolution passed 
at the party's Ninth National Convention, which stipulated that 
the regional directorate should "lay the foundations enabling 
the PT to present its own candidate." 
  The stand taken by the PT Executive Committee was motivated 
by the decision by the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement 
Party] in Rondonia to support the candidacy of Orestes Quercia. 
  In Bahia, the situation is too complicated for the PT 
leadership. The reason is that while the executive committee 
wants to develop support for the candidacy of Jutahy Magalhaes 
of the PSDB, most of the PT in Bahia wants to run a PT candidate 
and is suggesting the name of Zezeu Ribeiro. 
  To get around the problem, the Bahia PT is suggesting that 
Lula campaign for all three candidates: Zezeu Ribeiro for the 
PT, Jutahy Magalhaes for the PSDB, and the current front-runner 
in the polls, Joao Durval of the PMN [National Mobilization 
Party]. Joao Durval was launched in politics by former Governor 
Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of the PFL [Liberal Front Party].

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "Dangerous </F>
Relations"] 
  [Text] President Carlos Menem does not leave for tomorrow 
what he can destroy today. Taking advantage of President Itamar 
Franco's absence at the end of the Ibero-American Summit, the 
Argentine chief of state devised a broad support base for the 
candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is leaving the 
Mexican presidency next September, to director general of the 
World Trade Organization (WTO). President Menem ignored the 
candidacy of current Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero 
formally presented to the organization that will replace GATT. 
Menem trampled over the basics of Mercosur [Common Market of the 
South], which includes the adoption of common action on subjects 
of common interests. He tread on good manners by taking 
advantage of the Brazilian delegation's absence to accomplish 
his scheme. With this he obtained Latin America's informal 
support for the Mexican candidate, but he also harmed relations 
between Brazil and Argentina. Brazil's immediate reaction was to 
cancel the visit of Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo 
on 27 and 28 June to Brazil: Brazilian authorities will not 
have time to receive the Argentine minister. 
  The mood of the bilateral relations has therefore been 
established. What could Brazil expect to save from the remnants 
of a relation whose vitality was in the economic field, and 
which Buenos Aires insists on damaging in the political field? 
The impression is that Menem and his political advisers are not 
capable of designing a policy of rapprochement with the United 
States without harming relations with Brazil. Given that a 
policy of rapprochement with the United States is not 
incompatible with a good relationship with Brazil, the hostility 
-- invariably unfounded -- with which we are treated is more 
shocking. 
  The Cartagena episode is just one of a series. Before it 
took 
place, Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion had said 
Argentina would not support Brazil's intention to obtain a 
permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Minister Cavallo got 
sick and tired of telling the Brazilians how to conduct their 
economic affairs. When establishing regulations for Mercosur, 
the Argentines went back and forth endlessly. A common external 
tariff has not been established so far because Buenos Aires 
hindered the process and blamed Brazil for structural 
distortions that were rather due to the frozen Argentine 
exchange rate, an essential part of the Cavallo Plan. 
  The Argentine Government knew beforehand about Minister 
Ricupero's candidacy to the WTO. Argentina maintains close trade 
relations with Brazil, a fact that is the embryo for a more 
serious economic, social, and political integration. Menem's 
underhanded action -- considering the circumstances in which he 
performed it -- demonstrate an unsustainable position. The 
Brazilian authority who from now on accepts the political and 
moral commitments assumed by this Justicialist administration in 
relations with Mercosur at face value would be foolish; the 
Brazilian authority who considers Argentine policies 
foreseeable, a quality that is the basis of trust, would be 
irresponsible. 
  The Argentine Government has made its choice regarding 
Brazil. It has exchanged the excellent relations we had for a 
move that could end in granting Mexico, therefore NAFTA, 
therefore the United States, the general direction of the World 
Trade Organization. We have nothing to object to the candidacy 
of Salinas or the United States, the largest world power. What 
is repugnant to our conscience and goes against our good sense 
is the shameless maneuver that disqualifies its author and 
places its beneficiary under suspicion. 
  Everything indicates that President Menem will be reelected 
for four more years in office. This obliges Brazilian diplomacy, 
as of now, to treat Argentina with the seriousness the situation 
demands and with the politeness with which we have not been 
treated. In order to prevent the negative trade balance from 
affecting the results of the Cavallo Plan and Mercosur, Brazil 
has been purchasing from Argentina what it could buy elsewhere 
with greater political gains. Mexico could supply us with the 
same oil we buy from Argentina. Canada has the wheat we obtain 
from Argentina. Those two countries are NAFTA members and if 
the example set by the Casa Rosada [Argentine Government House] 
is correct, the future is in the north and not in the south. 
There is no reason for purchasing goods from Argentina just to 
maintain a balance of accounts. That is the exclusive problem of 
Argentina. Let us just center on the cost-benefit relation in 
our trade and policy and do just what is totally gainful for us. 
Argentina has so far established the terms of our relations, 
clearly demonstrating that it believes that a special 
relationship is a one-way path. Brazil does not have to shoulder 
such a burden.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "An Irrational Embargo"] </F>
  [Text] Irrespective of the angle from which one looks at 
the situation in Cuba, Fidel Castro's regime is a dictatorship. 
Even so, it is difficult to disagree with the Cuban president 
when he complains, as he did at the Ibero-American Summit held 
recently in Cartagena (Colombia), about his counterparts --with 
the exception of Itamar Franco -- remaining silent about the 
blockade the United States has imposed on the island for 32 
years. 
  There are at least two strong reasons to substantiate the 
claim that the embargo entails an unacceptable act of violence. 
The first is humanitarian. It has become crystal clear during 
the past 32 years that it is the Cuban people, not their 
leaders, who have suffered the blockade's effects. 
  The embargo has not provoked the regime's downfall but 
rather 
a steady decline in the people's standard of living in general, 
especially now that Cuba can no longer count on the resources it 
used to receive from the now-defunct Soviet Union. 
  The second reason has to do with being consistent. There is 
no way of justifying the U.S. Government's decision to maintain 
its embargo against the Cuban dictatorship after having granted 
preferential trading status to another even more brutal 
dictatorship, that of China. 
  It should be admitted that a dictatorship is a dictatorship 
under any circumstance, or that a dictatorship can be more 
readily accepted when it offers a more profitable business. 
There is no denying that this factor introduces a great deal of 
cynicism in relations among countries and makes the embargo of 
Cuba all the more unacceptable. 
  It is appropriate to note another inconsistency here: The 
Latin American political map was plagued by military 
dictatorships during the 70's and part of the 80's. This fact 
did not cause the United States to impose an embargo on any of 
those regimes that were unwilling to cooperate with it. Again, 
a dictatorship -- whether from the right or the left -- should 
be considered a dictatorship. Otherwise, the "democratic" logic 
behind the embargo would be untenable. 
  The truth is that the blockade of Cuba is a remnant of the 
Cold War. The United States appears to remain watchful despite 
the failure of communism, despite the theory that socialist 
regimes are tolerated in other parts of the world, although not 
in what used to be called its "back yard." 
  Obviously the fact of living under a dictatorship has 
overshadowed Cuba's merit of having some good social 
accomplishments compared to other countries in the region, 
Brazil included. One cannot absolve, however, totalitarian 
regimes only because one of them may have obtained some rather 
positive statistics. 
  It will not be by strangling Cuba through the embargo that 
we 
will make it a democratic country. The correct reasoning is 
exactly the opposite: It is by reincorporating Cuba into the 
inter-American system, instead of leaving it isolated, that we 
would make it more democratic. By coexisting with countries 
that today are mostly democratic, Cuba would be decisively 
influenced by the example of these countries.

<F P=106> [Editorial from the "Notes and Information" page: "The </F>
Cartagena Summit"] 
  [Text] The Ibero-American Summit has proved to be more 
important an international event for the number of figures 
attending it -- this time 22 chiefs of state or government 
attended it in Cartagena -- than for the decisions made therein. 
In terms of the number of statesmen attending it, the summit 
also proved useful for bilateral contacts that otherwise would 
not be made. Aside from that, however, it simply served to 
emphasize the contradictions and the discrepancies between the 
two Ibero-American worlds and point out the differences inside 
each of these worlds. It is, therefore, almost impossible to 
reach agreements at these summits, particularly on principles so 
broad that their contents prove to be obvious and end up by 
becoming almost irrelevant. 
  There is, however, one noticeable exception. Cuba invariably 
takes the opportunity afforded to it by Argentine President 
Carlos Menem to recruit supporters for its sad cause. This 
time, after Menem's customary attack on the Castroist regime, 
President Itamar Franco sympathized with Cuba's plight, seeing 
"positive signs of a reform" being implemented on the island and 
defended Cuba's readmission into the Inter-American system. 
Commander Fidel Castro decided to contribute to the agenda of 
the Summit of the Americas, which will be held in Miami in 
December, even though Cuba has not been invited to attend. As 
expected, Castro calls for the end of the economic embargo 
imposed on Cuba by the United States, the evacuation of 
Guantanamo Base and of the U.S. bases in Panama, the pardoning 
of the Latin American foreign debt, and the abolition of Super 
Law 301. 
  Ibero-American countries should really do their best to 
clarify the distorted image Cuba reflects. For the past decade, 
no Latin American country has subjected the island to any 
important or special trade restrictions and for the past decade 
European countries have been trading with Cuba as they wish. 
Despite all this, Cuba's misery is attributed to an embargo 
imposed on it by the United States. This is one of those lies 
that run the risk of becoming accepted as true out of sheer 
repetition. Cuba faces dreadful economic hardships because 
Fidel Castro perseveres with his clumsy policies -- maybe 
because he chose socialism instead of capitalism, maybe because 
he remains in power thanks to his caudillo-like dictatorship 
instead of trusting the virtues of liberal democracy. The U.S. 
embargo is the best excuse for Fidel Castro's failure. 
  There is, however, another side to this coin. There is harsh 
criticism in the United States of the embargo on Cuba and its 
exclusion from the Inter-American system. The U.S. people 
understand that Castro uses the embargo to remain in power 
without having to commit himself to any reform that would 
undoubtedly lead to the redemocratization of the island. An 
ever-increasing number of influential U.S. citizens, including 
members of the active Cuban colony in Florida, openly call for 
normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. As to Cuba's readmission 
into the OAS, it must be recalled that the reasons for 
suspending Cuba from this forum have ceased to exist. Cuba no 
longer exports the revolution and the original reasons for 
temporarily preventing the Cuban Government from fulfilling its 
functions at the OAS no longer exist either. In addition, most 
OAS member countries have diplomatic and trade relations with 
Havana. 
  In spite of what President Itamar Franco said, there are no 
signs in Cuba that democracy is being restored. Economic dogmas 
are more lax as a result of the increasing shortage of basic 
products and the opening of the country to tourism is the only 
way the government could at least partially replace the inflow 
of strong currencies previously received from Russia. The 
democracies of the hemisphere and President Itamar Franco 
should, however, press the Cuban dictator in a friendly way to 
agree to freedom-promoting political reforms. This is the 
goodwill sign Fidel Castro should give before the Inter-American 
community takes another step forward.

<F P=106> [Article by Daniel Victor Sosa] </F>
  [Text] Sources close to the negotiations have told 
PAGINA/12 that the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] economy 
vice ministers have achieved "spectacular" progress in defining 
the common external tariff that will become effective for the 
four regional partners as of 1995. According to an official, 
the six-month deadlock was broken after an agreement was reached 
on the discussion of the capital goods issue, the most sensitive 
point of the negotiations, and after Brazil raised a "very 
flexible" proposal on informatics. Nevertheless, these 
optimistic prospects were partially shadowed by an announcement 
made by former Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, the 
candidate with the best chances of winning the upcoming 
elections in his country. Sanguinetti announced that, if he 
regains power, he would ask that the common tariff system be 
postponed for four years. 
  The Economy Ministry hopes that an agreement can be 
announced 
during the presidential summit slated for 14 and 15 July in 
Buenos Aires. The current differences concerning capital goods 
are extremely pronounced, as Argentina has scrapped tariffs on 
all equipment, irrespective of origin, while Brazil protects its 
manufacturers by levying customs duties going as high as 35 
percent. During the negotiations, Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo's team proposed a 12-percent compromise, but the 
Brazilians are intent on 16 percent. One negotiator reported 
that "a good settlement might be to establish a 14 percent 
tariff as a goal to be achieved within a longer period of time, 
let us say 2006." The countries would then later have to work 
out an agreement on informatics and telecommunications. 
  Applying the criterion of compensation between the two 
leading partners did the trick in reconciling their differences. 
A diplomat recalled that "when Argentina reduced the tariff on 
the import of equipment to zero, the Brazilians lost the 
advantage they had with the preferential tariff. Cavallo then 
promised to `indemnify' the injured party. Brazil has now 
liberalized the purchase of meat, and the Argentine producers 
are now the injured party." 
  Argentine Commerce and Investment Secretary Carlos Sanchez 
discussed the future incorporation of Chile into Mercosur with 
his colleagues from Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay: Economic 
Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch; Finance Under Secretary Juan 
Ignacio Garcia Peluffo; and Integration Vice Minister Ruben 
Fadlala respectively. Some 30 officials from the four countries 
also participated in this meeting. 
  An Argentine official said: "If next month, the presidents 
announce the coming into force of a free trade zone (trade 
liberalization between the four partners) and a customs union 
(including a common external tariff) as of 1 January 1995, we 
will then have the rest of the year to negotiate with the other 
Latin American Integration Association member countries. 
  Another two key subjects discussed at the meeting included 
the system of origin of goods (the way to prevent smuggling due 
to the difference in tariffs, which will persist in several 
sectors for more than a decade), and the duty-free zones. 
  Commenting on his position on Mercosur, which is supported 
by 
the Chamber of Industry of Uruguay, Sanguinetti said "we have to 
be realistic and postpone this transition stage for another four 
years," as the four member countries "are not in a position to 
reach agreement on a common external tariff at present."

<F P=106> [Report by Zenaida Costales for the "National Radio News"] </F>
  [Text] For over 34 years, Cubans have witnessed the U.S. 
increased encouragement of illegal emigrations. Accounts of 
diplomatic mission violations, departures by sea, temporary 
trips without return, and Guantanamo Base infiltrations followed. 
  Experts on the subject say that the absence of a real U.S. 
immigration policy has been obvious for more than 30 years and 
the Cuban case evidently receives preferential status. 
  [Begin Antonio Aja, assistant director of Havana 
University's 
Center of Studies and Political Alternatives, recording] Unlike 
other immigrants who arrive on the Florida coast and are 
deported to their countries, this does not happen in the case of 
Cubans. Why? Because there is a U.S. law that functions parallel 
to the normal general immigration law -- the Cuban Quota 
Adjustment Law, which dates back to 1966. This legislation 
categorizes Cubans arriving on the Florida coasts, or the U.S. 
coasts in general, as political refugees, whether or not they 
are political refugees. As we have discussed in this regard, if 
these people basically have an economic or social motivation, or 
if their goal is a family reunion, they do not qualify as 
political refugees. Furthermore, they have no... [end recording] 
  The U.S. immigration policy toward Cuba is closely linked to 
a vast propaganda campaign supported by the media, which 
manipulates public opinion and, in many cases, magnifies the 
events. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] The U.S. Coast 
Guard 
has reported that 37 Cubans were rescued in the Gulf as they 
approached Florida. Arturo Cobo, director of the Stock Island 
Refugee Center, gives some of the newly arrived persons' names. 
[passage indistinct] 
  [Aja] Floridian press and radio stations refer to the topic 
of the rafters, the human problem involved. It is true that they 
publish the number of people who arrive; it is also true that 
they give weather reports and sea conditions for navigation on 
the coast. It is also true that they talk about Hands to the 
Rescue, an organization that reportedly exists to rescue those 
who try to illegally emigrate by sea. In other words, a series 
of subliminal messages are sent from Florida by the press and 
radio; and logically, this.... [end recording] 
  Aja's opinion and this reporter's information are not 
enough. 
It is also necessary to include the views of those who leave 
their lives to fate and decide to embark on the sea adventure. A 
northwest-bound floating craft leaves under cover of darkness. 
Who are they? No one knows. Their goal? To go beyond the 90-mile 
barrier and reach the United States. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified speaker] We leave the coast 
behind. We are tense. We think of nothing. We are tense because 
we do not know what might happen. We row all night long [words 
indistinct]. Dawn comes and we are far away. We can see the 
shore by then. 
  [Costales] Did not you think about your family and their 
concern about you? 
  [Unidentified speaker] Yes, of course. I left here without 
saying where I was going. Later, when we were rowing, we were 
tense and looking around in case something was coming, or 
someone was coming to rescue us. I decided to leave on the spur 
of the moment. Later, I realized [words indistinct]. Also, I did 
not feel good here. There is no hope, there is no future. [end 
recording] 
  The Cuban Government has been receptive and has implemented 
a 
process that renders emigration laws more flexible. The United 
States, however, continues to close its doors to legal 
immigrations, but is willing to maintain a flow of illegal 
immigrations as an argument to maintain its stance against Cuba.

  [Text] Marcelino dos Santos, Mozambique's Assembly 
president, said during a news conference that there is an 
historic demand for Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] to win 
the elections and there is no possibility that its main 
opposition, Renamo [Mazambique National Resistance], could wage 
a war as UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola] did in Angola after the elections. 
  Dos Santos also said the conditions under which his country 
will celebrate its national holiday on 25 June. Dos Santos 
stressed that he was in Cuba to learn firsthand the situation 
there and the manner in which the people are ready to resist and 
triumph. 
  [Begin Dos Santos recording, in Portuguese] I would like to 
express our complete solidarity with the Republic of Cuba. We 
must fight this international illegality, the economic blockade 
against Cuba, which is an international bastion. 
  Let us not forget that the peoples of the world need Cuba to 
remain firm, and that it is important for the progress of all 
peoples. Furthermore, I would say the victory of the Cuban 
people is necessary for all the peoples of the world. [end

<F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Tourism Osmany Cienfuegos by </F>
Felix Fernando Garrido on the "Exclusive" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Garrido] On the first day of the fourth 
Ibero-American Symposium on Tourism, Politburo member Osmany 
Cienfuegos, Cuban Minister of Tourism, made the following 
comments for this newscast: 
  [Begin recording] [Cienfuegos] First of all, I believe this 
is an important effort. This helps to establish a closer 
relation among our peoples and I believe that the effort to hold 
the symposium in the municipality where tourism is actually 
carried out is an important thing. In this, we have a lot to 
learn and we have already begun. We believe that an event such 
as this helps us and our comrades to understand the importance 
of the development of municipal tourism so we can learn from the 
things done in these countries. 
  [Garrido] This is the fourth symposium. What do you think 
have been the main results of the past three and what are the 
expectations for this meeting? 
  [Cienfuegos] The main achievement is making sure this type 
of 
event continues to be held. I believe that is the most important 
thing. We must make sure the symposium is permanent. 
  [Garrido] Are there expectations on the self-sufficiency of 
the tourism activities at the base level? Undoubtedly, this also 
has another purpose. What is your opinion on this? 
  [Cienfuegos] If we do not achieve self-sufficiency at the 
base level, then it is not a base activity. 
  [Garrido] We have heard that the goal is 1 million tourists 
for 1995. 
  [Cienfuegos] There has been talk about 1 million tourists in 
1995 and of 1 billion [currency not specified] in income. The 
goal of 1 million tourists in 1995 will not be met. We will 
reach the goal of 1 billion, however, which is probably the most 
important thing. We will reach 1 billion in 1995. 
  [Garrido] Where would you place tourism regarding its 
importance in the Cuban economy? 
  [Cienfuegos] Tourism is one of the main sources of income. 
That has been said before. Comrade Fidel himself said, during 
the meeting in Varadero, that tourism is destined to be the main 
source of income for Cuba. This year, it is likely to be the 
main source of income as a consequence of the small sugar 
harvest we had. 
  [Garrido] Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] On 22 June, GRANMA reported that producing 60 
million cigarettes a day satisfies the demand for regulated and 
extra quotas, as well as unregulated sales of cigarettes. The 
article cites the Agriculture Ministry's tobacco enterprise 
union as saying that the eight cigarettes factories are at full 
production capacity. The article points out that 14,468,900 
packs of cigarettes were distributed to the population between 1 
June -- when cigarette sales were deregulated -- and 16 June. 
The demand for unregulated cigarettes on the national market, 
initially high, has decreased. This has helped market stability.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on criminal activity monitored between 16 and 22 June. 

    Las Tunas Authorities Enforce Self-Employment Rules -- The 
administrative council in Las Tunas Province, which is enforcing 
Decree 186 on self-employment, has issued 884 summons, resulting 
in 103 fines totaling 107,000 pesos. Las Tunas and Puerto Padre 
Municipalities had the highest number of incidents, 72 and 13 
respectively. Taxi drivers, handicraft makers, shoemakers, farm 
produce vendors, cart drivers, lighter refill vendors, and 
unauthorized fast food vendors commit most of the violations. 
Local labor and social security officials plan to register 
handicraft makers by specialty. (Havana Radio Rebelde Network in 
Spanish 1155 GMT 16 Jun 94) 
  Havana City Meat Processing Plant Under Investigation -- The 
Sido Redondo meat processing plant, in San Miguel del Padron 
Municipality, Havana City, is under investigation. A Ministry 
of Finances and Prices audit has noted, among other 
administrative faults, that over 15 tonnes of beef, valued at 
over 22,000 pesos, has disappeared; that over 39 tonnes of meat, 
valued at over 56,000 pesos, was diverted to the plant workers' 
cafeteria; and that over 48 tonnes of meat has been turned over 
to unauthorized organizations. The police have arrested eight 
of the plant's administrators, who will be tried once the 
investigation is completed. (Havana Radio Progreso Network in 
Spanish 1100 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  Soybeans Stolen From Havana Port -- Police continue to 
arrest 
truck drivers who were stealing tonnes of soybeans from Havana 
port. The truck drivers, working for the Construction Ministry, 
were arrested and charged with stealing tonnes of soybeans 
destined for animal feed factories. The truck drivers took 
advantage of the lack of control at the port to commit this 
crime. They were diverting the soybeans to the black market. 
The drivers confessed to the charges and said that they were 
paid 5,000 pesos for every five tonnes of soybeans that they 
stole. (Havana Radio Progreso Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 22 Jun

<F P=106> [Report by Jean Luckenson on news conference held by the </F>
Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, formerly 
Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, 
FRAPH, on 21 June -- passages within italics in Creole] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Luckenson] They have 
gone from threats to action. FRAPH, which stood for the 
Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti, has 
become the Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People and 
has called for a general strike for 24 June. FRAPH leader 
Emmanuel Constant, in tiger-striped pants, a black t-shirt, with 
a gun around his waist, asked the head of the provisional 
government, Attorney Emile Jonassaint, who is not recognized by 
the international community, to close the doors of his 
ministries to protest the actions of first U.S. citizen, Mr. 
Clinton; the 16 December president, Dr. Aristide; new U.S. 
charge d'affaires in the Haitian crisis, Mr. William Gray; and 
the deaths of the 143,000 children who have already died. These 
deaths are part of the negative results of the unfair, criminal 
international embargo imposed on the Haitian people. 
  This statement was made by Emmanuel Constant during a news 
conference on 21 June at about 1500. [passage omitted] 
  A few days after Clinton's executive order, Louis Jodel 
Chambelain, founder of the party, said it is a serious time and 
the leaders of all political parties, all sectors of national 
life must break their silence. The Front, which shares the 
opinion of President Jonassaint, who said that only elections 
can solve the country's problems, is wondering if the elections 
will be held. Meanwhile, the national coordinator of the party, 
Louis Jodel Chambelain, who was wearing a grey suit, appeared in 
public for the first time since his last statement, asking the 
international community to ensure his safety. [passage omitted] 
  Chambelain congratulates the foreigners who continue 
living in Haiti despite the country's hard times and tells them 
there is no problem; they are safe. Chambelain also took the 
opportunity to severely criticize certain ministers who are part 
of the 11 May government, which most parliamentarians have 
accused of abusing authority. He took the opportunity to 
denounce the administrative mess prevailing in public offices, 
which a small group continues to enjoy even though they never 
work. 
  For his part, Constant said [quote] the Fatherland is 
in danger and a state of emergency has been ordered by the 11 
May president. As previously announced, we have gone into action 
today, not to create a parallel body, but to (?work under the 
supervision) of the Haitian Armed Forces [FADH]. For the time 
being, we are first aid workers whose mission is to protect the 
national territory. We are working 24 hours a day. Unquote. 
  [Begin Constant recording] We have decided to become the 
Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, as we have been 
saying since 17 August. This does not mean we want to create a 
parallel body, on the contrary, we want to put ourselves in the 
service of the FADH, or at least with the colors and the 
institutions in charge of preserving the sovereignty of the 
territory. 
  First, we have become first aid workers. First, we have 
become first aid workers [repeats] because of the state of 
emergency. Second, we are always ready, 24 hours a day, to 
protect the Haitian territory and to protect the people who wish 
to leave on boats, who will even set out for Guantanamo; to 
prepare our traditional arms, not firearms, but traditional 
arms, which will be used throughout the country in case of 
invasion because it is (?easy) to land in Haiti by dropping 
bombs....[end recording] 
  [Luckenson] Journalists reminded Constant that the 
government issued a communique saying that only the FADH are 
authorized to carry weapons on national territory. Constant 
replied that in case of an intervention, the Haitian Army will 
be obliged to accept all citizens who come to help it defend the 
national territory as Haitians. The FRAPH secretary general 
called on journalists to seize the opportunity to get images and 
pictures of the FRAPH members because this would be their last 
news conference. After this, there would be no one in the 
offices because they were going to withdraw to strategic areas 
to make traditional weapons such as pikes, magic potions, 
hammocks, and other materials to be used in case of foreign 
intervention. 
  Constant pointed out that foreigners must respect 
President Jonassaint's latest communique concerning strategic 
areas. He believes that as noted in the communique, the 
Jonassaint government will not agree to planes being used for 
propaganda.

  [Text] Mexico City, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The existence of armed 
groups in Mexico, denounced by Zapatist National Liberation 
Front [EZLN] leader Subcommander Marcos, has been tacitly 
confirmed by the Mexican Government by its expulsion of 
Ecuadoran Priest Marcos Gonzalo Holla del Salto, who was charged 
with having led a group of armed civilians. 
  Holla del Salto, 59, was accused of leading and arming a 
group of civilians in the eastern state of Puebla with shotguns, 
.22-caliber rifles, and other small arms. The authorities have 
not disclosed any details about the group, but Holla del Salto 
was expelled for having forged Mexican citizenship documents. 
  The Ecuadoran priest was arrested Sunday in Chapulco, 
Puebla, 
180 km east of the Mexican capital, and he was expelled from the 
country Monday, which prompted protests by some 500 of his 
followers who blocked local highways to demand his return. 
  Holla's arrest and the existence of his armed group aroused 
the concern of a group of senators, who asked the government to 
investigate the existence of organizations such as this one, 
particularly in areas susceptible to unrest. 
  The Mexican Government must detect "additional armed groups 
in areas in which there may be social conflicts," said 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) Senator Alger Leon, 
chairman of the Senate Defense Commission. 
  German Sierra, a senator from Puebla, asked authorities to 
dismantle the armed group organized by Holla del Salto, who 
lived in Chapulco. Sierra also admitted that the authorities 
were aware of Holla's activities for some time but had failed to 
act to avoid confrontations with the fanatics who sheltered him. 
Senator Sierra denied the priest was involved in drug 
trafficking or that he had connections with other guerrilla 
groups in the country, characterizing the existence of the 
Puebla organization as no threat "because its members do not 
have high-caliber weapons." 
  The Secretariat of Defense recently admitted that it had 
unsuccessfully investigated reports that approximately 2,000 
AK-47 submachine guns, which are known in Mexico as "goat 
horns," had entered the country. According to the reports, the 
weapons, allegedly part of a larger shipment, may have been 
intended for drug traffickers or armed groups in certain 
southern Mexico states. 
  The Ecuadoran priest, who arrived in Mexico in December 
1961, 
managed to leave Mexico to further his religious studies in 
Europe and to reenter the country on several occasions using 
false documents. According to records, he resided in Chapulco. 
  Puebla State and southern and southeastern Mexico, including 
the state of Chiapas, are the areas with the highest rate of 
poverty and, therefore, are the areas in which the probable 
existence of armed groups is the highest. 
  Subcommander "Marcos" of the EZLN, which staged an uprising 
on 1 January in Chiapas in southeastern Mexico, says he has been 
informed that there are other armed groups in the country. 
Subcommander "Marcos" said: "The government's blindness 
prevents it from seeing that there are armed groups in various 
parts of the republic, that they are multiplying, and that a 
civil war is imminent."

  [Text] Last night, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said 
the government of the republic will maintain the economic and 
social commitments made in the San Cristobal de las Casas 
dialogue, which was aimed at finding a political solution to the 
armed conflict in Chiapas. 
  After learning of the resignation of Manuel Camacho Solis, 
peace and reconciliation commissioner, the president announced 
the tasks to achieve peace in the state have been placed under 
the coordination of the spokesman of the executive office, 
headed by Governor Javier Lopez Moreno. 
  The president met with Manuel Camacho Solis, who presented 
his resignation as Chiapas peace and reconciliation 
commissioner, during the afternoon. The Mexican president 
acknowledged that the former foreign secretary had done his work 
in Chiapas "with personal honesty, political talent, and a 
desire to serve." 
  The president said the work Camacho Solis began on 10 
January 
contributed to the government-ordered cease-fire and the San 
Cristobal de las Casas dialogue. 
  Meanwhile, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, presidential 
candidate of the National Action Party (PAN), has said "it seems 
to me the decision expressed in Camacho Solis' public statement 
is respectable," adding the resignation letter of the now former 
commissioner is "serious and honorable." 
  Last night, the legislative faction of the Party of the 
Democratic Revolution (PRD) in the Chamber of Deputies issued a 
statement stating Camacho Solis' resignation "indicates a break 
with those who want to reduce the demands for democracy to their 
minimum expression and entails severe criticism of the chief of 
the executive due to his inability to restrain the government's 
most hardline sectors." 
  The PRD deputies have said Camacho's decision will create 
great tension among the participants in the Chiapas conflict and 
"increase the danger that hostilities will break out at any 
moment." 
  The PRD, the legislators have said, will insist with "every 
possible means" that it is necessary to continue seeking a 
political solution to the Chiapas conflict and a concrete and 
satisfactory reply to the Zapatist National Liberation Front's 
demands for real democracy. 
  Amalia Garcia, who participated in the meeting of 
intellectuals and politicians who proposed a peaceful transition 
to democracy, has said it was "unfortunate" that politicians 
with jobs "are relegated, while the opinions of those who 
maintain a hardline position in politics or who promote 
arbitrary decisions gain ground." She said this is a sign that 
the members of the government who "have favored dialogue and 
political negotiation are being pressured and excluded."

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos of the </F>
Zapatist National Liberation Army by Gaspar Morquecho in the 
Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, on 19 June; all quotation marks as 
published] 
  [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, 19 Jun -- "I believe 
Camacho is a courageous man. He clearly stated why he was 
resigning because he had made a serious effort here." This is 
how Subcommander Marcos appraised Manuel Camacho's resignation 
as commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas during 
an interview he granted in the jungle. He also talked about the 
National Democratic Convention, elections within EZLN [Zapatist 
National Liberation Army]-controlled areas, and reactions to the 
Zapatists' rejection of the peace accords. 
  [Morquecho] What is the EZLN's reaction to Camacho's 
resignation as peace commissioner? 
  [Marcos] As we see it, on one hand, Mr. Camacho's 
resignation 
shows a lack of understanding by one of the presidential 
candidates -- namely, Mr. Zedillo --to the significance of a 
dialogue and the negotiations process. 
  "In his blindness, he does not see the advances made, such 
as 
the postponement of the cease-fire, the assurances that it will 
be respected and that one side will not attack the other, that 
the electoral process has gotten under way, and that elections 
can be held nationwide. All of these are achievements reached 
at the negotiating table in San Cristobal, and merit must 
definitely be given to the mediator and the commissioner. 
  "When Mr. Zedillo invalidates, diminishes, or underrates the 
work done by the commissioner, he is really undermining his 
position and is taking the position of demanding a surrender. 
"Mr. Zedillo sees the lack of a surrender as a failure. How 
can we trust this candidate? If he wins the presidency, how can 
he be open to negotiations or have a conciliatory attitude in 
resolving the Chiapas conflict or, more specifically, the EZLN 
conflict? 
  "It is definitely a low blow by the PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] to the efforts made to advance the dialogue 
and the negotiations, and it reflects a historic blindness to 
see the advances that were made. 
  "What we also see is that when Camacho made the proposals in 
response to the EZLN demands, he made an honest effort and acted 
responsibly. He worked to get responses that would satisfy our 
demands during the consultations, especially after Colosio's 
murder. An interest group somewhere or a power group within the 
federal government started to block all of the initiatives 
geared to supporting those proposals, forcing us to notice that 
no promises were going to be kept, and giving the impression 
that Mr. Camacho had failed to obtain the EZLN's unconditional 
surrender. The idea was to keep him busy so he would not 
overshadow the PRI candidate in the middle of a campaign which, 
everyone knows, is extremely weak. 
  "It seems to me that Camacho is courageous. He is clear when 
he says why he is quitting because he made a serious effort and 
we have acknowledged this. His efforts have been invalidated by 
a man who is attempting to become the president of the republic 
for the government party. The fact that he quit and said why he 
was doing so shows that Camacho is a brave man." 
  [Morquecho] What can you tell us about the National 
Democratic Convention the EZLN has called for? 
  [Marcos] From the outset, the Chiapas civilian sectors' 
response was very perceptive because they were able to clearly 
see, I imagine, the problems of a civil war, as well as the need 
to find a solution, because, in one way or another, they are the 
ones who will have to endure the brunt of a war. 
  "Chiapas civilian society understands that a convention is 
the only chance worth taking in the process to achieve change. 
A national-level response to this proposal is still lacking. 
Several sectors have already taken a stand, but still very few 
have done so. 
  "We want to clearly state that the National Democratic 
Convention is not an EZLN convention, that is to say; it is not 
a convention to vindicate the armed struggle but, rather, a 
convention to search for a peaceful change and for a political 
path to democracy. 
  "There is the fear that it will be a Zapatist convention 
which could result in the vindication of the armed struggle -- 
the vindication of the EZLN, led by the EZLN. 
  "We are not proposing that the convention declare itself in 
support of the armed struggle. Just the opposite is true. We 
are saying the convention must declare that it will do 
something. It must not sit and wait for 22 August but, instead, 
do something before then and make an effort that is worth 
making. We have nothing to lose by trying to determine whether 
it is still possible to push for a peaceful transition to 
democracy. 
  "I am interested in clarifying this because I have read that 
it might be interpreted that the convention would be the 
political arm of the EZLN. 
  "The National Convention will be the political arm of the 
democratic struggle, just as the EZLN is the military arm of the 
democratic struggle. In terms political experts like to use a 
lot nowadays, the hard line comprises the EZLN, and the 
conciliatory or peaceful line comprises civilian society. 
  "We are asking civilian society to organize more and not to 
be divided. It could be through the convention, or it could be 
through something else. By convening the convention, we are 
responding to people who tell us: I want to do something; I do 
not agree with the armed struggle, but I do agree with 
democracy. Therefore, we are telling them: Well then, meet. 
  "We are offering them territory, support, protection, and an 
idea of what could be. We are also offering an explanation of 
what led us to take up arms, and which might take you to the 
ballots. That would be the convention, and it would be good if 
this were clear, right now, before it is held." 
  [Morquecho] Talking about elections, what does it mean not 
to 
hinder the electoral process in the zone under Zapatist control? 
  [Marcos] "We are willing to permit the entry of candidates 
who want to campaign, the entry of ballot boxes, the holding of 
the vote, and we are willing to give guarantees so there will be 
no interference from our forces in this entire process. We are 
appealing to the International Red Cross [IRC] to verify that 
there is no aggression on our part, foreseeing there might be 
provocations that might be blamed on us. 
  "That is one of the achievements of the negotiations, the 
opening of the door by the most radical sector of democracy -- 
the hard democratic line, which is the EZLN -- so the peaceful 
transition that civilian society demands so much will take place. 
  "We are yielding the ground won by civilian society, the 
ground on which it can conduct its work, which, in this case, is 
the electoral process in August. We will offer every 
assistance, even decidedly standing back, if there are 
guarantees that this will go down on record. 
  "This is why we are appealing to nongovernmental 
organizations [NGO's], mainly those being organized in Chiapas, 
to monitor this process, ensuring it is held normally within our 
guidelines. 
  "This does not mean we are now calling on people to vote; it 
simply means we are not going to interfere and we are going to 
be consistent with the position we expressed in January when we 
said we were not planning to interfere in the electoral process 
in August." 
  [Morquecho] This means there will be polling officials and 
representatives of the parties. The intervention of the IRC and 
NGO's is being requested. This would involve voting tables at 
polls in the areas under Zapatist control. 
  [Marcos] "Yes, but the difference is that these elections 
will be the first ones organized by civilian society in national 
territory. In other words, we are turning over to the NGO's the 
organization of everything that must be done here in Zapatist 
territory. 
  "We think it is an interesting barometer for the rest of the 
country and the rest of civilian society to see elections that 
are organized neither by the government nor an armed 
organization in rebellion, and instead are organized by that 
third force, whose belligerence we recognize and which is 
civilian society itself. 
  "It would be a great nonbellicose advance -- I mean, an 
unarmed and nonviolent advance, a peaceful advance. Civilian 
society would organize those elections in our territories. That 
would be the big difference." 
  [Morquecho] Then, there is an open invitation to all 
candidates from every political party, in this case the 
government party? 
  [Marcos] An open invitation? No, because there are some 
people for whom we feel nothing but contempt. We will simply 
not oppose to their doing whatever they have to do, but we will 
not welcome them with open arms, especially those who would seem 
to have suddenly forgotten what their elections record is in a 
state in which fraud was so notorious that they even got elected 
as senators with the so-called people's support. 
  "Let us not forget. We know what history is, and we must 
acknowledge it. We will not prevent them from campaigning, but 
the population of those regions under Zapatista control are 
quite aware of who's who. We guarantee that there will be no 
attack or interference of any sort. We are definitely not 
inviting everyone, but if they want to come, we will not prevent 
them." 
  [Morquecho] What were the reactions in Chiapas with respect 
to the Zapatist opposition to the signing of a peace agreement? 
Is there any apprehension as a result of some of the reactions? 
I am referring now to opposition from the cattle ranchers, the 
government, and the Army. 
  [Marcos] Once again, the Army is using phrases like 
"transgressors of the law" and "violence professionals." These 
are expressions it had discarded. The important issue here is 
that they had agreed to respect the cease-fire, but now they are 
leaving it open to the decision of their commander in chief who, 
in this case, is Mr. Salinas de Gortari. 
  "While the EZLN is guaranteeing that it will respect the 
cease-fire and is making every effort for it not to be broken, 
so far, the Army is honoring it, but it is not giving any 
assurances that it will last. It is also making the military 
climate somewhat unstable and is blocking the elbow room we were 
trying create -- the elbow room of a peaceful transition. 
  "On the other hand, the ranchers' reaction is contradictory 
because what they wanted was our surrender, which would have 
brought about peace. Now they are criticizing the government 
for not to adopting a hard-line position. They do not want 
negotiations. They want the Zapatists broken once and for all, 
if they fail to accept what they are offered. 
  "This reaction is understandable. It unmasks, once and for 
all, the alleged mediating position adopted by those ranchers 
who were seeking public office, already negotiating, involved in 
a dialogue, and who knows what. The masks they wore have 
finally been removed, and once again they have returned to the 
position they have always held. 
  "All of this is aimed at misleading the voters into not 
believing that the so-called Indian -- Mestizo, or Ejido -- 
cattle owners formula can fool someone. [sentence as published] 
  "On the other hand, the PRI, which has always been very 
insightful in implementing the best possible policies in this 
state -- evidence of this lies in the fact that we decided to 
take up arms -- chose to name as candidates to public office 
people who have always been widely unpopular. Several of these 
people are not even known, have always adopted a 
middle-of-the-road position, and have never been to the 
districts they say they represent. There are others who 
undoubtedly represent a repressive tradition, such as that of 
the cattle ranchers. 
  "The election climate throughout the state clearly shows 
that 
the PRI's permanence is also the continuation of the same 
conditions that forced the EZLN to take up arms and remain 
armed. It has been clearly demonstrated that the PRI, at the 
state level -- and we still have the national level to consider 
-- is the party that understood the war the least, as well as 
the fact that it is the party that is responsible for 
determining if this continues or comes to an end. 
  "The PRI has not understood or assessed the situation. It 
still believes that things can remain the way they were before 
by simply changing its speeches, by discussing the masses more, 
or by supporting the rights and interests of the Indian 
population. Even the ranchers have resorted to this, as if it 
were possible to erase the track record they have accumulated. 
  "No candidate running for public office has ever come here 
to 
the Zapatist territories. Neither have the municipal presidents 
of Ocosingo or Las Margaritas gone any further than those 
communities. The municipal president of Las Margaritas never 
went any further than Las Margaritas. The Ocosingo municipal 
president never went any further than the brewery located at El 
Jatate crossing. 
  "The only candidate running for public office that has 
entered Zapatist territory, but when it was not yet a Zapatist 
region, was Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is candidate for the 
presidency of the republic -- but not one deputy or replacement, 
whether on a slate or a single ticket, or anything. Not even 
one candidate running for municipal president ever came to this 
region to request votes from places where they supposedly won 
with 100 percent support."

<F P=106> [Article by Alonso Urrutia] </F>
  [Text] Yesterday, Ernesto Zedillo, PRI [Institutional 
Revolutionary Party] Mexican presidential candidate, said that 
to end the Chiapas conflict, the government of the Republic 
should "establish, as soon as possible, a board with political 
and social representation, and authority to engage in a 
dialogue, in a definite negotiation," with the Zapatist National 
Liberation Army [EZLN]. 
  The candidate who headed the installation ceremony of the 
Consulting Board of the Mexican Foundation Cambio 21, Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, said that a political solution to the 
continuing conflict is the only answer. "The only road to peace 
is the political process." No progress, no true solution will 
be possible through violence. [quotation marks as published] 
  Before approximately 50 councilmen assembled at the Museum 
of 
Mexico City, Zedillo said the political process is "the 
pluralistic, participative, and legitimate forum" to implement 
changes and to solve differences. 
  Zedillo assured that democracy is the supreme value of the 
political process and that it is indispensable for Mexico's 
progress. "All economic progress, all social improvement can 
only last within a democratic framework." 
  Zedillo noted that in the past years, electoral reforms have 
been fostered and that these reforms have allowed adaptation of 
legislation to society's requirements. He talked about the 
Senate's new configuration, the elimination of the clause of 
governalibilty in the Deputies Chamber, the "decisive presence" 
of citizens in the Federal Electoral Institute, as well as the 
establishment of ceilings for campaign spending. 
  Nevertheless, he recognized that it is necessary to improve 
the system. "Democracy cannot be imposed by the government, by a 
political party, by an ideological current, or by a group. 
Above all, democracy cannot be imposed nor perfected by the use 
of violence or by appealing to measures outside the law or 
institutions." 
  Zedillo emphasized that Mexico is a pluralistic society, 
expressed through a regime of parties with diverse visions, but, 
he added it is also a nation of laws and institutions. 
"Democracy is based on the enforcement of our state of law." 
  The candidate added that Mexican democracy is strengthened 
by 
greater participation and the presence of its community and its 
organizations. "One of the challenges our party faces is to 
recognize and foster citizen participation, including those who 
say they are not active in any political party." 
  "Political parties should encourage citizens and 
organizations to participate, however, citizens in turn should 
respect the multiparty activists and the functions the 
Constitution grants them as entities of public interest." 
  Zedillo said it is necessary to progress toward the 
perfection of democracy through the internal strengthening of 
political organizations "to invigorate our electoral processes 
and to overcome abstentionism and skepticism." An important 
factor for democracy is dialogue." 
  The conflict that emerged in Chiapas is a signal to the 
nation's conscience, Zedillo added. In Chiapas, we share in the 
responsibility to undertake serious social reforms to assure 
each family, each community, adequate living conditions and 
genuine opportunities for the well being of everyone." 
  "It is our obligation to find a true and speedy resolution 
of 
economic and regional problems. We share in the desire for 
peace in Chiapas to be obtained quickly and with justice, based 
on a dialogue, understanding, and the best intentions of the 
parties involved in the conflict." 
  "No true resolution will be possible through violence. A 
resolution will only be possible in a climate of peace, respect 
for the law, and constructive dialogue. This is why we reject 
the use of force. This is why we appeal that resolution to this 
conflict be sought through the political process, that the 
resolution to the Chiapas conflict be found through dialogue."

  [Text] Mexico City, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Ernesto Zedillo, 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential candidate, 
described foreign observers' participation in the upcoming 
elections in Mexico as a "major step forward." 
  "This is the first time our electoral legislation has 
recognized this type of participant. I believe this is a major 
step forward," Zedillo, a 42-year-old economist who has a 
doctorate degree from Yale University, said during an interview 
with the Mexican newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO. 
  The "foreign visitors" category was incorporated this year 
into legislation that allows, together with an invitation to the 
United Nations, international observers to issue a technical 
report on the Mexican electoral process. 
  Zedillo said this measure, together with new electoral 
provisions, "fosters better conditions so that anyone who is 
interested may witness that the Mexican elections will be an 
example of legality and democratic commitment." 
  Approximately 45 million Mexicans carrying their electoral 
card with their photograph will be called to the polls to elect 
a new president and renew part of Congress on 21 August. 
  Zedillo also said there is no party in Mexico with the 
organizational capability, structure, militancy, and social 
involvement as the PRI, which has uninterruptedly governed the 
country since 1929. 
  The presidential candidate said "Mexico is a consubstantial 
part of Latin America," and that is an irreplaceable and 
invaluable condition of its geographic location and the 
civilization to which Mexicans belong. 
  "A fundamental idea that must guide Mexican politics toward 
Latin America is to promote a greater cooperation toward two of 
our geopolitical borders --Central America and the Caribbean." 
  "It is fundamental for us that cooperation prevail in that 
region" so as "to maintain and improve the different mechanisms 
for consultation and consensus, including the Group of Three, 
the Rio Group, and the Ibero-American Conference," he added. 
  "It is also important to decidedly continue the promotion of 
regional integration and foster the expansion and consolidation 
of opportunities for free trade and economic complementariness, 
as we have done with Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, and 
Venezuela," he added. 
  Zedillo, one of the nine presidential candidates, added he 
will promote an "ambitious program of reform that will provide a 
tax framework that will be competitive at the international 
level," if he wins. 
  He also said he would stimulate competition through a 
greater 
opening of the financial sector and promote greater deregulation 
in order to expand the variety of financial services and 
expedite more businessmen's access to the debt and capital 
market. 
  In addition to Zedillo, other top contenders for the 
Presidency include Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the 
conservative National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of 
the Party of the Democratic Revolution.

  [Text] An attack on Dr. Mario Bolanos, director of the 
National Public Security Academy (ANSP), who was unharmed, and 
subsequent armed confrontations left three people killed 
yesterday. One of Bolanos' bodyguards was killed in the attack, 
which occurred as Bolanos traveled along the Panamerican Highway 
in Usulutan. 
  The attack, which occurred at the Mercedes Umana turnoff 
yesterday morning, happened when seven individuals riding in 
other vehicles attacked Bolanos' car by surprise. 
  Bodyguards accompanied the director of the ANSP, which 
trains 
National Civil Police [PNC] agents. 
  The criminals fled after realizing the attempt on Bolanos' 
life had failed. Therefore, all PNC offices in the Eastern Zone 
began an operation to find those who executed the attack. 
  One of the vehicles in which the assailants rode was found 
in 
Berlin, where police clashed with the criminals. One of 
Bolanos' bodyguards, whose identification was not disclosed, was 
killed in this incident. 
  After this clash, PNC agents and some of Bolanos' bodyguards 
began to chase the criminals and caught up with them on 4th West 
Street and 7th Northern Avenue in the neighborhood of La Merced 
in Usulutan, where an armed confrontation took place. Two 
criminals were killed, and one was wounded in this clash. 
  One of the dead was identified as Luis Alberto Ostorga 
Mejia, 
a 44-year old from Estanzuelas, Usulutan. More than 1,000 
colones were found in his possession, money that was presumably 
stolen. The other dead man was not identified. According to 
the subcommissioner in charge of the operation, however, he was 
approximately 30 years old, wore blue pants, a white shirt, and 
tennis shoes. He had 3,000 colones, a watch, a chain, and a 
yellow ring. 
  The suspect who was wounded was not identified. He was taken 
to San Miguel Regional Hospital under police custody. 
  The three suspects were riding in a white Toyota van, 
license 
plate No. MI-2416, presumably stolen. They carried no auto 
ownership papers, and the vehicle was identified as a van owned 
by an international mission. 
  A Motorola radio, an AK-47 rifle, a Bronix weapon, and a 
sawed-off Uzi machine gun were found inside the vehicle, but 
none of them were registered under the criminals' name. 
  PNC sources consulted in San Salvador confirmed the attack 
and stated a team is already investigating it.

  [Text] Tegucigalpa, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Thousands of 
workers, peasants, and teachers marched today through the main 
streets of Tegucigalpa to demand that salaries be increased and 
that the economic adjustment program in force since 1990 be 
suspended. 
  "The IMF reduces our salaries," "the moral revolution is 
killing the people," and "the rooster is screwing us up from 
early on," were slogans chanted by demonstrators, who criticized 
the administration of Carlos Roberto Reina. 
  Reina, who took office on 27 January, used "moral 
revolution" 
as his campaign slogan to stop corruption as well as a "red 
rooster" as a symbol to convey his idea of "a new dawn" for the 
people with a "new government style." 
  Reina stated that his government's "hands are tied" by such 
problems inherited from the previous administration as the 
11.2-percent fiscal deficit, the $3.6-billion foreign debt, and 
$450-million annual foreign debt payments. 
  The demonstrators asked for a 100-percent general wage 
increase, inflation control, a decrease in the price of staples 
and housing, as well as comprehensive agrarian and forest reform 
programs to preserve the environment. 
  The day before the demonstration the government approved a 
30-percent average increase in inter city collective 
transportation fees. 
  Repeated unofficial reports indicate that there will be a 
devaluation of the lempira, the national currency, as well as 
new hikes in fuel and electricity prices. These rumors have 
raised further concern among grass-roots sectors. 
  Experts said that over 5,000 demonstrators demanded jail 
sentences for officials and former officials of the National 
Enterprise for Electric Power because they believe these 
officials' mistakes have caused electricity rationing of 35 
hours per week throughout the country. 
  The government faces negotiations with teachers who demand a 
salary increase. The government must also deal with a conflict 
concerning salary payments between the owners of the almost 
defunct company Honduran Air Services, Incorporated, and over 
400 workers of this company. 
  The demonstrators asked people to unite and to support their 
demands, and they announced new and larger demonstrations in the 
coming days. 
  The government of former President Rafael Leonardo Callejas 
began in 1990 a rigorous economic adjustment program with the 
support of such financial organizations as the IMF and the World 
Bank. 
  The grass-roots sectors repeatedly rejected that program 
and, according to analysts, it caused the electoral defeat of 
the conservative National Party of Honduras.

  [Text] Managua, 22 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Nicaraguan police have 
arrested 11 former soldiers who today occupied for several hours 
the cathedral in the northern city of Esteli to demand that the 
government comply with the accords on demobilized groups, 
authorities have reported. 
  National Police Spokesperson Rosario Gomez said in the 
Nicaraguan capital that after learning about the cathedral 
occupation in Esteli, 184 km north of Managua, police appeared 
at the site and forcefully removed demonstrators. 
  No serious incidents during the eviction of the former 
soldiers, who used to work for the Government Ministry, were 
reported, the police spokesperson added. 
  The 11 former soldiers were taken to a prison in Esteli, 
while their comrades negotiate their liberation with the 
government, according to sources close to those arrested. 
  The former Government Ministry officials demand that the 
government comply with the accords to compensate them for 
leaving their military posts, as a result of the Armed Forces 
reduction implemented in 1990. 
  Two weeks ago, former soldiers took over the Managua 
cathedral and the Venezuelan Embassy in a similar fashion. They 
later abandoned these buildings after several hours of 
negotiations with officials of the government of President 
Violeta Chamorro. 
  Gomez said on Wednesday that a group of transportation 
workers blocked for several hours the road to Esteli demanding 
security guarantees from the government. 
  The police called on transportation workers to abandon the 
road, the spokesperson concluded without giving further details.

<F P=106> [Report by Lastenia Murillo Munoz] </F>
  [Text] Immigration Department Director Antonio Dominguez 
announced yesterday the Panamanian Government has granted asylum 
to 150 Haitians who are in Panama, provided they do not practice 
voodoo. 
  "We have told them they cannot practice voodoo while they 
are 
in Panama; otherwise, I will be forced to revoke their visas and 
deport them," Dominguez said. 
  Voodoo is an ancient practice, a combination of religion and 
magic which African slaves had brought to Haiti and which is a 
type of witchcraft that stirs apprehension in certain parts of 
the world. 
  Dominguez said this group includes Haitians who arrived in 
Panama from January to the present. Some of them have been 
granted an extension while others have opted to hide. 
  According to Dominguez, these 150 Haitians are ineligible 
for 
political asylum; as a result, the National Organization for 
Attention to Refugees cannot give them economic assistance, nor 
can the Immigration Department. 
  Panama suspended commercial flights to Haiti last week, in 
keeping with UN sanctions against the de facto regime, which has 
ruled Haiti for three years. 
  The Central American governments, including Panama's, has 
rejected a recent U.S. request to admit Haitian nationals into 
their countries.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Panamanian economic developments monitored through 21 
June. 
  Trade activities between Panama and Taiwan reached 
approximately $350 million in 1993, making Panama the second 
leading market for Taiwanese exports. Trade between the two 
nations is expected to increase to approximately $370 million 
this year. (Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 17 June 94 p 17 A) 
  Based on the behavior of the leading economic indicators 
during the first four months of the year, no significant changes 
are expected in the export levels of traditional products 
compared to figures obtained in 1993. Nontraditional exports, 
which already total $190 million, have experienced an increase 
in amount, value, and variety. The export of services for 1994 
will experience a 5-percent increase if current figures prevail. 
Duty-free zone activities will grow, but not as much as in 
1993, and the volume of oil carried by pipeline will decrease as 
anticipated. A growth in tourism will remain moderate. 
Concerning imports, the collection of tariffs and sales taxes 
indicate a 15-percent increase. (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA 
in Spanish 17 June 94 p 8 A)

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf has announced 
the establishment of an agency in charge of investigating and 
bringing charges against "discriminatory, racist, and xenophobic 
activities." The federal government will thus promote tracking 
down members of the Nazi regime who were involved in the murder 
and persecution of people during World War II and who currently 
reside in Argentina. 
  The establishment of this agency was stipulated in a 
resolution that Ruckauf will sign in Bariloche today. The 
minister spent the weekend at the residence of the Neuquen 
governor, El Mesidor, which is located in Villa La Angostura. 
  Ruckauf announced on 17 June that the government will 
extradite former Nazi officer Erich Priebke, who is currently in 
custody on charges of having been implicated in the murder of 
335 people in Rome, in March 1944, during World War II. 
  According to the resolution Interior Ministry Secretary 
Alberto Iribarne and Daniel Barberis, population and community 
relations under secretary, will be charged with drafting a bill 
providing for the establishment of the agency within 90 days. A 
copy of the text will be sent this afternoon to the chairman of 
the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish Associations (DAIA), Ruben 
Beraja, who is currently in Israel. He will thus be able to 
officially convey the Argentine Government's decision to the 
Israeli president. 
  Ruckauf will sign the resolution at the Open Puerto tea room 
at 1300, during a ceremony to launch the "National Program for 
Nondiscrimination." Among the reasons underpinning this 
decision, the government cited "evidence that individuals who 
have been implicated in atrocious crimes against human rights" 
during World War II "have tried to escape from justice by 
seeking refuge in Argentina, thus taking advantage of its vast 
territory." 
  It further stated that "the atrocities committed" under the 
Nazi regime, which ruled Germany from 1933 to 1945, "violate the 
humanist principles enshrined in our national Constitution." 
  "Argentina has again and again been taken unawares by the 
discovery of people charged with crimes against human rights," 
it added. 
  The first article of the resolution makes it clear that the 
agency will seek to "prove the existence on Argentine territory 
of persons who during World War II were implicated in the 
extermination of people, or in the murder and persecution of 
individuals or groups of individuals because of race, religion, 
nationality, or political opinion." 
  Following this decision, the government will convene 
"nongovernmental organizations struggling against 
discrimination, racism, and xenophobia" to draw up a bill 
providing the legal framework for this agency. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman will leave 
for the United States today to discuss several commercial 
matters in Guatemala's relation with that country, the peace 
process, and other topics. 
  Vielman commented on this visit during an impromptu news 
conference: 
  [Begin recording] [Vielman] I am going to discuss the travel 
warning [previous two words in English], the progress of the SGT 
[expansion unknown], and the so-called parity, which is the 
temporary treatment the U.S. Government would give to Central 
American imports to partially align them with the benefits that 
NAFTA grants. 
  It is also important to present to the U.S. Government the 
progress made in the peace process, especially because the 
United States is one of the friendly countries that supports the 
Guatemalan peace process. 
  I will also meet with the administrative personnel of 
certain 
congressmen who have visited Guatemala to assess the country's 
situation; therefore, it is important that they hear, from the 
Foreign Ministry, the government's position on various issues. 
I also plan to grant interviews to the media, such as CNN and 
others. The Guatemalan Embassy is in charge of that. 
  [Unidentified reporter] When will you travel? 
  [Vielman] Today. 
  [Reporter] How long will the visit last? 
  [Vielman] Three days. The Guatemalan Foreign Ministry can 
give you the list of meetings I will attend. I have scheduled 
meetings that will last 30 minutes or one hour each. I have a 
busy schedule. 
  [Reporter] Who will accompany you? 
  [Vielman] Our ambassador to Washington, Fernando Suzen, 
director of Multilateral Relations, and Foreign Ministry Adviser 
Francisco Villagran De Leon. 
  [Reporter] Will anyone from the private sector go? 
  [Vielman] No, not on this occasion, but I am taking with me 
a 
copy of an Economy Ministry document on the meetings it held 
with the private sector last month. We have already coordinated 
everything so that the position of the government and the 
private sector will be coherently presented in Washington. [end

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 21 
June. 
  Finance Minister Ana de Molina said on 15 June the directors 
of the Paris Club set September as the deadline for Congress to 
approve renegotiation of the debt. If the debt is not 
renegotiated by then, the exemptions and advantages previously 
negotiated with the Paris Club members will be canceled, and 
Guatemala's image abroad will deteriorate. (Guatemala City 
SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 16 June 94 p 6) 
  Willy Zapata, president of the Bank of Guatemala, said on 15 
June there is no reason to believe that a depreciation of the 
currency will occur at this point or that there will be currency 
exchange problems during the year, because the mechanisms the 
Bank of Guatemala has implemented are yielding positive results. 
(Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 16 June 94 p 4) 
  The Spanish Government has expressed its support for 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government by accepting the 
total payment of $115 million for the debt incurred when the 
plant Celgusa was built. In order to pay this debt, the plant 
will be sold for U.S. Treasury bonds. (Guatemala City SIGLO 
VEINTIUNO in Spanish 17 June 94 p 5)

  [Text] The Indians have announced they will continue their 
uprising to pressure the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to 
declare the Land Development Law unconstitutional. Indians from 
the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador [Conaie] 
appeared today before the Court of Constitutional Guarantees to 
pressure the court into handing down a decision that declares 
the Land Development Law unconstitutional. Conaie President Luis 
Macas denied having reached an agreement with the government 
regarding the formation of a joint commission to regulate the 
law's enforcement. 
  [Begin Macas recording] The government is responsible for 
what has happened up to now. Obviously, the National Congress is 
equally responsible. We would also like to make one thing clear: 
We realize it is extremely difficult for the Ecuadoran people to 
understand us. We would like to say, however, that those who are 
spreading uncertainty and violence in the countryside are those 
who violated the Constitution at the National Congress, followed 
by the president's sanctioning of an unconstitutional law. [end 
recording] 
  The Indians, who came down from several Ecuadoran mountain 
provinces, chanted slogans and said their protests will only end 
with the repeal of the law or with their deaths. 
  Carlos Jaramillo, president of the Court of Constitutional 
Guarantees, promised to process the Indian request as quickly as 
possible. Luis Macas, on behalf of the Ecuadoran Indian 
communities, discarded the possibility of reaching any type of 
agreement with the government. He assured that the Indians would 
only end their protest when the land law is repealed. The Indian 
uprising, then, will continue to pressure the Court of 
Constitutional Guarantees to overturn the law. 
  Chimborazo Province is completely paralyzed at this time by 
the Indian demonstrations. In our midday newscast, we reported 
on the situation there with statements by one of the strike 
coordinators. In the town of Guamote, Indians occupied the main 
administration building. This morning, they said they are ready 
to go as far as they have to. They are also demanding the 
government revoke the law. Deputy-elect (Cesar Vuelva) of 
Chimborazo Province said they will not return to their homes 
until the law is annulled. 
  [Begin (Vuelva) recording] Three Indians have died -- one 
from Tungurahua and two from Canar province -- and we still have 
no specific answer to our request from the president. They may 
propose we reform the law's articles, or to draft the 
regulations to enforce the law. We cannot support this. The rank 
and file of the Indian organizations have ordered us to demand 
absolute repeal of the law. 
  (Vuelva) maintains that the peasant-Indian coordinating 
board 
is more united now than ever before, and no one will be able to 
dissolve the peasants' organizations.

  [Text] Today, the United Workers Front, FUT, which groups 
the country's major unions, called for a general strike next 
Tuesday. It also called for marches and demonstrations all over 
the country starting today, Wednesday, although the state of 
emergency President Sixto Duran Ballen decreed last night is 
still in force. The labor groups made their decision at 1430, 
and a union spokesman made the announcement. 
  The FUT reached its decision after a meeting that lasted 
several hours. The unity of the people will decide matters, the 
group said. Duran Ballen decreed a state of emergency on Tuesday 
night when protests in the country, begun by Indians and 
peasants on 13 June, escalated. The Indians and peasants began 
protesting immediately after the approval of an agrarian law 
that they describe as racist and illegal. There are 
approximately five million Indians in Ecuador. The union members 
decried the militarization of the country with the enforcement 
of the state of emergency and said that despite the state of 
emergency, several major and secondary highways remain blocked, 
something the government military chiefs denied earlier.

the government's emergency decree has been very positive. 
  [Begin Barrilla recording] The emergency decree has been 
very 
positive to balance the economic, social, and cultural 
activities, especially in (?Apat) City. We are also normalizing 
activities related to the supply of agriculture products. In all 
the cantons, with the exception of Figaro and Cevallos, the 
situation has normalized. The reports from Figaro indicate that 
it is no longer a peasant protest but that political agitators 
have taken over. We have been told that the Figaro and Cevallos 
municipal council presidents are the ones inciting against the 
government. The agriculture sectors are not protesting. In 
Salasaca, between Pelileo and Ambato, there are still groups 
that resist and do not allow vehicles to pass. [end recording]

is still very worrisome because, although it is true that the 
government decreed the state of emergency, the flow of traffic

<F P=106> [Report by Marco Antonio Moreira] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- To offset the setback 
suffered by Brazilian Ambassador to Portugal Jose Aparecido de 
Oliveira over the last-minute cancellation of his trip to 
Lisbon, President Itamar Franco today asked former President 
Jose Sarney (who is a senator for the Brazilian Democratic 
Movement Party, Amapa State) to head the Brazilian delegation to 
the Seminar on Economic and Entrepreneurial Cooperation and to 
the signing of the declaration creating the Community of 
Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). 
  Sarney promptly accepted the invitation, which was extended 
personally by Franco. Sarney returned from France on 20 June. 
Today he stayed home recovering from labyrinthitis. At 1700 on 
22 June, Sarney will meet with the members of the Brazilian 
delegation to discuss details of the trip, which is scheduled to 
start on 24 June. Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has informed 
the Portuguese Government about the change. 
  Franco said by asking Sarney to head the delegation he was 
paying tribute to the presidents of Portugal, Angola, Cape 
Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, and Sao Tome and Principe 
because the first meeting aimed at creating the International 
Institute of the Portuguese Language with the attendance of the 
heads of state of these countries was held on 3 November [no 
year given] in Sao Luiz (Maranhao) and was organized by 
Ambassador de Oliveira, who was then culture minister of the 
Sarney government. 
  In a communique released today at Planalto Palace, the 
president states that despite having postponed his trip to 
Portugal, he will visit that country before the end of his term 
to commemorate the creation of the CPLP and to resume bilateral 
talks with Portuguese Prime Minister Cavaco e Silva. The 
Brazilian delegation will include cabinet ministers, executives 
of state-owned companies, and private businessmen who will pay 
their own travel expenses. 
  Presidential Spokesman Fernando Costa has said Franco's 
decision to postpone the trip was in no way related to the death 
of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto Franco, although the 
cancellation came after his death. "The president was shaken by 
Ariosto's death," Costa said, "but he has chosen to stay in 
Brazil because he considers his presence necessary on the eve of 
the implementation of the real."

  [Text] Pretoria, RSA, 21 Jun (AE) -- South African 
President Nelson Mandela today received Workers Party [PT] 
presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The black 
leader received Lula with a broad smile as if he were an old 
friend, and treated him as a president-elect. They praised each 
other during brief statements to the media after the meeting. 
Mandela expressed support for Lula and showed interest in his 
election. Lula referred to the South African leader as "one of 
the great personalities of this century." The meeting should 
have had taken place on 20 June, but when Lula arrived in the 
Union Hill Palace at the scheduled time, he was not received by 
Mandela. An adviser informed him that Mandela could not receive 
him because of a slight ailment. 
  This was the third meeting between Mandela and Lula. They 
met in Tripoli and in Havana. After speaking about the 
situation in South Africa Mandela wanted to know about Brazilian 
politics and economy. He asked about the situation of the 
Brazilian people before the elections. Lula told him about the 
election campaign, the Real Plan, and the social reality in the 
country. He criticized what he calls "social-economic 
apartheid" in Brazil and promised to combat it if elected with 
"measures in the field of education, labor, and housing." The 
South African leader told Lula his plans to combat problems 
similar to the Brazilian ones. 
  They also spoke about bilateral relations, especially trade. 
Mandela discussed the subject as if Lula had already won the 
elections. He said he wanted to visit Brazil as soon as Lula is 
installed. He then offered to discuss any subject of bilateral 
interest. 
  At the end of the meeting Mandela accompanied Lula and 
Brazilian Ambassador to the RSA Antonio Amaral de Sampaio to 
another room where CUT [Sole Workers Center] leader Vicente 
Paulo da Silva, Deputy Benedita da Silva, and PT campaign 
coordinator Professor Marco Aurelio Garcia were waiting. Soon 
afterward they all went to the stairs of the Union Hill Palace 
where Lula and Mandela made brief statements. 
  Following the meeting in Union Hill Palace, Lula, the 
ambassador, and his delegation boarded a plane at noon to Cape 
Town where Lula is scheduled to dine with other South African 
government officials. The host is Minister Without Portfolio Jay 
Naidoo, who is responsible for the Development and 
Reconstruction Program (DRP). Through this program Mandela 
intends to build 1 million houses over five years, create 2.5 
million new jobs, and guarantee 10 years of basic and higher 
education. 
  A constituent assembly will be formed on 22 June in Cape 
Town. Late in the afternoon Lula and his delegation will return 
to Johannesburg and board an plane that will take them to 
Frankfurt, Germany, the second leg of his trip.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- The Army Ministry has 
ordered an investigation to find out who is responsible for the 
detonation of a home-made bomb last week in the Army 
headquarters in Brasilia. The bomb did not cause any damage but 
it made a lot of noise. A message found at the site of the 
explosion states: "War is not necessary, eating is," 
paraphrasing Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. The message is 
interpreted as a warning over low military salaries. 
  Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra denied the existence 
of 
the message and minimized the effects of the explosion at the 
Army headquarters, which is known in Brasilia as "Fort Apache." 
He said the initial investigations show it will be difficult to 
discover who is responsible for the explosion, which took place 
on the third floor of the Training and Research Department 
(DEP). The official report states that the explosion was caused 
more by a firecracker than a real bomb. The main report was 
drafted by a DEP colonel. 
  The explosion was an "isolated incident that has nothing to 
do with salary demands." He said military personnel know of 
their chiefs' efforts to achieve a salary increase and know 
President Itamar has promised to improve their situation. "We 
must wait a little because everything depends on arrangements in 
the economic field," he said. 
  Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim today 
confirmed that a salary increase for civilian and military 
employees will be discussed and defined after the implementation 
of the new currency, the real. "It has already been decided, 
and a salary increase will not be discussed now," he said. Once 
the real is in circulation in July the government will resume 
discussions to implement the Equal Salary Law which foresees a 
28 percent real increase for public servants, the minister said. 
The increase will come in August.

<F P=106> [Report by Aldo Renato Soares] </F>
  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Jun (AE) -- The PFL [Liberal Front 
Party] leader in the Senate, Senator Marco Maciel (PE) 
[Pernambuco], will present an alternative draft bill to the 
industrial property bill approved by the Chamber of Deputies 
last April. Maciel decided to present an alternative proposal 
because there are strong differences of opinion between the two 
Senate rapporteurs, Senator Jose Richa, (PSDB-PR) [Brazilian 
Social Democracy Party, Parana], from the Economic Affairs 
Committee, and Senator Antonio Mariz (PMDB-PB) [Brazilian 
Democratic Movement Party, Paraiba] from the Constitution and 
Justice Committee. "If we have two different opinions, the 
approval of the definite bill will be more difficult," Maciel 
said. 
  The two Senate committees today discussed the bill for more 
than four hours with several civilian institution 
representatives. Francisco Teixeira, executive vice president of 
the Brazilian Pharmaceutical Industry Association (Interfarma), 
which gathers together all foreign laboratories, required 
several changes to be made to the patents bill already approved 
by the lower house. Abifarma [Brazilian Pharmaceutical 
Industries Association] supports the patenting of genetically 
modified microorganisms, and rejects the requirement that 
patented products should be produced domestically. The 
laboratories also want imports to be authorized by the patent 
holder abroad, or by his licensed dealers. 
  Representatives from the Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock 
Research Enterprise (Embrapa) and national laboratories are 
against the changes suggested by Interfarma. Senator Jose Richa 
wants to make the bill more flexible. Senator Antonio Mariz, on 
the contrary, wants to maintain the basic points approved by the 
Chamber of Deputies. Senator Marco Maciel, who today 
participated in the discussions as a member of the Economic 
Affairs Committee, said that if the two recommendations are sent 
to a vote in the plenary hall the bill will not be approved this 
year. He believes that an alternative project will facilitate 
an agreement and the approval of the bill by the Senate after 
the elections.

<F P=106> [Report by Nilton Horita] </F>
  [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 Jun (AE) -- This time the confusion 
that has arisen on the international monetary market is helping 
Brazil. According to the Termo brokerage firm, one of the main 
agricultural operators in the Commodities and Futures Exchange, 
Brazil could increase its revenues from exports of agricultural 
commodities from $5 billion to $6 billion this year, with an 
average 60 percent increase in its coffee, soybean, orange 
juice, and cotton quotations, among others. 
  "With coffee alone, export revenues will increase by $1.2 
billion," says Termo director Francisco Arantes. The annual 
volume of agricultural exports amounts to $10 billion. "The 
prices of commodities began to increase in March due to the 
volatile nature of international interest rates, which has 
benefited Brazil," he adds. 
  Arnim Lore, director for international affairs at the Fonte 
Bank, says that American exports, as well as exports quoted in 
dollars, have gained greater competitiveness. "Brazilian 
exporters in general are gaining momentum," he said. Carlos 
Langoni, director of the World Economy Center of the Getulio 
Vargas Foundation, said that this is particularly true for those 
who are exporting to Europe and Asia. 
  According to Angelim Curiel, the Citibank foreign trade 
director, 80 percent of Brazilian exports are made in dollars. 
He said: "We are therefore in a similar position to that of 
U.S. exporters, whose prices will now become more competitive." 
He added: "In sum, those who export to Europe and Asia will 
benefit from the dollar decline, as will those who export to the 
United States, as a result of the greater economic activity." 
  In the case of agricultural commodities, exporters will win 
with the price increase. Other sectors will be able to sell 
their products more cheaply in the local currencies (such as 
Japanese yen or German mark) and increase their income by 
selling higher volumes. Economist Adroaldo Mouda da Silva, 
director of Silex Trading, notes that international developments 
will help Brazilian exporters at this juncture, when the 
implementation of the real will affect exports because it has 
established a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. "A form of 
compensation has taken place," he said. "Brazil will no doubt 
win a few billion dollars," he added.

<F P=106> [Article by Cynthia Malta: "Brazil Needs To Change Export </F>
Profile To Win Space in World Market"] 
  [Text] Sao Paulo--The profile of Brazilian exports must 
change so that the country can compete and win space in the 
world market over the next few years. That observation comes 
from Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero, who spoke yesterday at 
the international seminar on the "New Map of World Trade," 
sponsored by this newspaper. He said: "We are witnessing a 
panorama that requires care." 
  According to the minister, Brazil is outstanding as an 
exporter of bulk soybeans, orange juice, crude soybean oil, iron 
and steel products, and paper and cellulose. "Those are products 
with which Brazil shines more in terms of volumes 
exported--quantities--than in terms of value added to the 
product." That picture reflects a concentration of capital and 
"expresses Brazilian society itself"--that is, a society which 
has invested little in education and technological research and 
which is therefore being outdone by countries that made the 
necessary investments and now have more sophisticated and 
cheaper finished goods to export. 
  "When I arrived at GATT in November 1987, China was just 
beginning to export. I left GATT in 1991, and by then China was 
exporting twice as much as Brazil," said Ricupero, who was head 
of Brazil's delegation to GATT. In 1991, Chinese exports totaled 
about $73 billion. "Last year, China's exports and imports 
totaled $200 billion," the minister said. 
  He is especially concerned about the textile, capital goods, 
and footwear industries. "The textile industry is among those 
that will experience the fastest rate of growth in world trade 
over the next few years. It is estimated that garment exports 
will increase by 60 percent and that footwear exports will rise 
by 34 percent." The basis for comparison is the year 1992. If 
that turns out to be the case, the minister said, the biggest 
beneficiaries will probably be the Asian countries known as the 
Asian tigers: "the countries belonging to that zoological 
category, which is growing every year," the minister joked. 
  The situation in the footwear industry is also cause for 
concern. "Brazilian exporters have already lost the market for 
cheap shoes. China now has half the U.S. market, and the Chinese 
have now started to move ahead in the area of midpriced shoes," 
the minister said. 
  The capital goods industry is another weak point. "Twelve 
years ago, Brazil was exporting power lathes, but it started to 
lose market share when electronic components began to be used in 
those machines," the minister noted. When all is said and done, 
"Brazil did not make the necessary investments, but the Asians 
did." 
  According to the minister, Brazil should go back to 
investing 
from 22 to 23 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) so 
that its exports will resume their growth. He recalled that in 
the 1970's, the investment rate was 25 percent of GDP. By last 
year, that figure had fallen to 16.5 percent--the lowest 
percentage in Brazilian history. "This is a gap that we must 
close. But to do so, businessmen must have stable prospects so 
that they will become interested again and invest." 
  Jose Milton Dallari, the Ministry of Finance's special 
adviser on prices, was also present at the seminar. He noted 
that "the businessmen have that vision--that it is necessary to 
invest. But they are justifiably worried about short-term 
developments, about inflation, and about what they are going to 
do to get through this phase." 
  The minister noted, however, that he was "mindful of the 
needs of foreign trade and preparing measures for exports and 
imports." He pointed out that there were concerns about foreign 
exchange because of the introduction of the new currency on 1 
July and repeated that "the administration will announce a 
stable anchor appropriate to a stable economy." 
  Among the measures being prepared by the administration, the 
minister mentioned a reduction in federal and state 
taxes--especially the ICMS [goods and services movement tax], 
which the states collect on exports of semimanufactures--the 
opening of a line of credit through the National Bank for 
Economic and Social Development (BNDES), and the granting of 
export insurance for small and medium-size firms. 
  Ricupero noted that the program in question was coming at a 
time when the firms had little debt, were beginning to modernize 
their equipment (during the first three months of this year, 
imports of capital goods were up 30 percent over 1993), and were 
rapidly adopting international standards of quality. He said: 
"Over 300 firms already have their ISO [International 
Standardization Organization] 9000 certificate." 
<H5>  Minister Publishes Book in Chile </H5>
  Sao Paulo--Minister of Finance Rubens Ricupero is scheduled 
to publish a book entitled A Rodada Uruguai e o 
desenvolvimento da America Latina (The Uruguay Round and the 
Development of Latin America) in Santiago, Chile. The book 
will have a chapter on the prospects for developing countries 
following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT. 
  Here are the main points in the minister's analysis: 
  1. The multilateral system has been strengthened by the 
establishment of the World Trade Organization (the body that 
will replace GATT in January 1995). The countries, and 
especially developing countries, will benefit from improvements 
in the rules on safeguards, antidumping, subsidies, technical 
barriers, and the mechanism for resolving disputes. The 
countries should also benefit from the gradual liberalization of 
trade in agricultural products, textiles, and services. 
  2. The developed countries have reduced their average import 
tariffs by about 38 percent. That tariff reduction is expected 
to reduce the cost of $464 billion worth of imports by the 
developed countries. Tariff reductions were not offered on 
imports worth $148 billion. 
  3. Also expanded was the universe of goods imported by the 
developed countries and to which a tariff will not be applied. 
This group of products formerly accounted for 20 percent of the 
total tariff schedule, but is now up to 43 percent. The opening 
up of developing countries was even greater: the share of goods 
on which no tariff is collected rose from 22 percent to 45 
percent. 
  4. The developing countries also increased the number of 
products whose tariffs are consolidated in GATT, meaning that 
those tariffs cannot be increased. The developing countries, 
which had consolidated 21 percent of their tariff schedule in 
GATT before the Uruguay Round, have now expanded that share to 
65 percent. The industrialized countries have increased their 
share from 78 to 97 percent. 
  5. Using estimates worked up by GATT, the minister notes 
that 
by the year 2005, world trade in goods "will be 12 percent 
higher than it would have been without the Uruguay Round." This 
means an increase of $745 billion (in 1992 dollars) over the 
level that would have existed if trade had grown at the average 
annual rate recorded during the period between 1980 and 1991 
(4.1 percent). 
  6. The greatest growth in world trade is expected to occur 
in 
the clothing industry, where a 60-percent increase is predicted, 
textiles (34 percent), forest and fishery products (20 percent), 
and processed foods and beverages (19 percent). It is precisely 
in the textile industry, says the minister, that Brazil's weak 
point exists. He notes that Brazilian firms have not been 
investing to modernize their equipment and that that 
technological lag is causing the country to lose ground to the 
Southeast Asian countries when it comes to exports. 
  7. According to calculations by the World Bank (IBRD 
[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]), the 
OECD, and GATT, the growth in world income should total from 
$213 billion to $274 billion annually.

  [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- By 10 votes to one, the 
Federal Supreme Court (STF) has suspended Provisional Measure 
[MP] No. 524 on the conversion of school fees. Presidential 
Press Secretary Fernando Costa said that the government will 
respect the decision made by the STF, which declared 
unconstitutional the MP establishing the criteria by which 
school fees should be converted into URV's [real value units]. 
"The STF decision will be obeyed," he said. "But the government 
reserves its right to comment until the decree is published, in 
order to learn what led the STF justices to making this 
decision." 
  The STF decision, which upholds the petition for an 
injunction filed by the schools, shows that the objections made 
by Finance Ministry special adviser Jose Milton Dallari were 
correct. He was against the MP, which converted school fees 
based on the average of the previous four months' fees in real 
cruzeiros. Dallari recommended that the conversion be made 
based on the average fees in URV's, a criterion that is endorsed 
by the schools. His stance may cost him his post following the 
implementation of the real. 
  Dallari believed the text of the MP would generate a legal 
dispute that would end up favoring the schools, as it breaks the 
economic and financial balance of contracts. The STF decision 
demonstrates that he was right, despite the threats made by 
President Itamar Franco. Soon after the MP was issued, Dallari 
said that it would perhaps need some changes. Itamar became 
irritated and sent him a message through the newspapers: "Is 
Dallari the president?" 
  Dallari remained in his post only thanks to mediation by 
Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero in his favor before the 
president. All the same, Dallari is in a vulnerable position. 
The PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] presidential 
candidate and former finance minister, Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, who appointed Dallari to his present post, was 
consulted on the subject. Cardoso recommended that Dallari 
remain, at least for the time being. 
  Following the conflict with Franco (the second one, as the 
first clash they had was over the conversion of rents), Dallari 
stopped talking with the media. He decided not to grant 
interviews, and his closest aides surrounded him to prevent him 
from being approached by reporters. From his isolation Dallari 
can celebrate the STF's decision, which confirmed his arguments 
against the MP.

  [Text] Surprising decisions were made today in Congress. 
Despite recommendations by the respective Constitution and 
Justice Committees, the plenums of the Senate and the Chamber of 
Deputies respectively today dismissed charges against Senator 
Ronaldo Aragao and Deputy Ezio Ferreira. 
  The process against Senator Aragao began four months ago, 
and 
evidence that he was guilty was produced every step of the way. 
The Senate special committee recommended early this month that 
Aragao be impeached. Yet the plenum of the Senate today reached 
an altogether different decision. 
  Facing charges of having moved $700,000 in his banking 
accounts in one year and of having obtained benefits from 
construction companies, Aragao -- the only senator included on 
the list of the Congressional Investigating Committee on the 
budget scandal -- will not be impeached. In a secret vote, 28 
senators voted for the impeachment, while 19 voted against it. 
Because 41 votes were needed to impeach Aragao, the process 
against him was dismissed. Upon leaving the Senate, Aragao 
declined to make remarks to reporters. He only said that he was 
relieved and that the Senate has done justice. 
  There was also surprise in the Chamber of Deputies, which 
today heard the case of Deputy Ezio Ferreira, who was charged 
with moving 35 billion real cruzeiros in his banking accounts 
and having received checks from construction firms. Despite a 
recommendation approved earlier by the Constitution and Justice 
Committee that Ferreira be impeached, the plenum today dismissed 
the charges against him. Ferreira's attorney rebutted the 
charges, and tempers flared during the process. Yet the final 
vote came 73 votes short of impeachment. The Chamber of 
Deputies has thus dismissed the case against him.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the scheduled 3 October 
general elections in Brazil. 
<H5>  PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN </H5>
  Interior Votes To Decide Elections -- The elections this 
year 
will be decided by the voters living in the interior of the 
country, and not by those in the capitals. A study conducted by 
the Superior Electoral Board (TSE) shows that 70 million of the 
voters who will elect the new president live in the interior, 
and only 20 million in the capitals. The study was based on 
data collected during the 1993 plebiscite. The study indicates 
that Sao Paulo, with the largest number of voters in the 
country, has nearly 22 percent of Brazilian voters, and Minas 
Gerais, the second largest, about 12 percent. The TSE believes 
that more than 100 million people will vote in the 3 October 
elections. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 30 May 94 
p 9) 
  Main Presidential Candidates View Unemployment -- The four 
main presidential candidates have commented on their plans to 
fight unemployment. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the Workers 
Party (PT) candidate, wants to build agricultural villages and 
cooperatives, invest $25 billion in projects to create jobs, and 
build huge warehouses where small entrepreneurs can set up their 
industries without having to pay rent. Democratic Labor Party 
(PDT) candidate Leonel Brizola wants to register unemployed 
people and update the data on how many they are, grant 
incentives and technical assistance to micro and small 
enterprises, create new temporary jobs in public construction 
work, and invest Severance Pay Fund and Workers' Assistance Fund 
resources to create jobs and incorporate 8 million families into 
the job market. Progressive Renewal Party (PPR) candidate 
Esperidiao Amin wants to create 10 million new jobs in five 
years by making the micro-enterprises more dynamic and by 
granting incentives to agriculture, agro-industry, exports, and 
tourism, and by implementing a "Program to Fight Unemployment." 
Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) candidate Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso proposes creating 8 million jobs by defeating 
inflation, which will result in an increase in governmental 
resources, a reduction in taxes on salaries, and the possibility 
of allocating more funds to professional training and irrigation 
programs. Cardoso believes that these programs alone will create 
nearly 2.7 million direct and indirect jobs over the next four 
years. Finally, Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) 
candidate Orestes Quercia promises to invest in the 
infrastructure, but has not yet defined his goals and does not 
want to reveal his financial means. (Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in 
Portuguese 5 Jun 94 p 3) 
  PDT Convention Participants Polled -- A Datafolha poll 
conducted among the members of the PDT convention held on 29 May 
shows that 53 percent of them approve of a PDT alliance with the 
PMDB; 41 percent an alliance with the Brazilian Labor Party 
(PTB); 13 percent with the PSDB; an equal number with the PT; 
and 10 percent with the PPR. The poll also shows that if Brizola 
is not elected in the first round of elections, PDT members will 
support Lula (27 percent), Fernando Henrique Cardoso (20 
percent), none of them (44 percent), and 8 percent still do not 
know whom they will support. Asked whom they would support if 
they had to choose between Lula and Quercia, 43 percent would 
choose Quercia, 24 percent Lula, 26 percent neither of the two, 
and 8 percent remain undecided. If the choice had to be between 
Quercia and Cardoso, 43 percent would support Quercia, 26 
percent Cardoso, 24 percent neither of the two, and 7 percent 
are undecided. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese 31 
May 94 Section 1 p 4) 
  Lula Gains Support in Bahia State -- The Bahia office of the 
PSDB and the PT reached an agreement on 1 June that can benefit 
Lula: The PT withdrew the candidacy of its candidate for the 
Senate, Zezeu Ribeiro, and added its support to the PSDB ticket. 
The PSDB candidate for the Bahia governorship, Jutahy Magalhaes 
Jr., believes that this alliance will give Lula more than 1 
million votes and increase support for him by 20 percent to 30 
percent of state voters. In his first rally in Bahia, which is 
scheduled for 2 July, Lula will already be accompanied by 
Magalhaes. Lula believes this agreement will reduce the PSDB 
presidential candidate's possibilities. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA 
ESTADO in Portuguese 2156 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  PT Congressional Candidates Threaten to Rebel -- Forbidden 
to 
participate in Lula's rallies, the PT candidates for federal 
deputy have threatened to rebel against the PT national 
coordinating board that is coordinating the presidential 
campaign. Deputy Chico Vigilante, Federal District, said that 
the PT leadership is comprised of "a bunch of stupid 
bureaucrats," and he fears that the prohibition is harming 
Lula's candidacy. Deputy Helio Bicudo, Sao Paulo, also 
protested the decision. When Lula visited Brasilia at the 
beginning of June, only gubernatorial candidate Cristovam 
Buarque and vice presidential candidate Paulo Bisol were allowed 
to participate in the rallies organized there. Rio Grande do 
Sul Deputy Jose Fortunatti, PT leader in the Chamber of 
Deputies, harshly criticized the decision. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA 
ESTADO in Portuguese 2331 GMT 16 Jun 94) 
  ACM Support Not Helping Cardoso -- The latest polls 
conducted 
in Bahia State show that despite Antonio Carlos Magalhaes' 
support of PSDB presidential candidate Fernando Henrique 
Cardoso, only 13 percent of the people support him, while 54 
percent support the candidacy of the PT's Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva. This is the lowest level of support for Cardoso 
countrywide. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94 
p 6) 
  Cardoso Campaign in Financial Difficulties -- The Liberal 
Front Party (PFL) leader in the Senate, Marco Maciel, has 
complained about the financial difficulties being faced by PSDB 
presidential candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso's electoral 
campaign, the cost of which has been estimated at $75 million. 
Maciel said that the new electoral legislation seeking to 
ensure the openness of political campaign financing is 
frightening entrepreneurs who had planned to contribute to 
Cardoso's campaign. The PSDB-PFL-PTB coalition was the first to 
request campaign bonuses at the Superior Electoral Board. The 
requested bonuses amount to 10 percent of the overall cost of 
the campaign. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2156 GMT 
13 Jun 94) 
  Poll Shows Cardoso's Voters Hesitating -- A poll conducted 
by 
the Gerp Research Institute indicates that PSDB presidential 
candidate Fernando Henrique Cardoso's supporters are the most 
hesitant: 37.1 percent of them may switch their support to 
another candidate before the 3 October elections, while only 
23.4 percent of PT candidate Lula's supporters and 27.4 percent 
of PDT candidate Brizola's supporters would do so. The poll, 
which was based on interviews conducted with 3,213 people during 
the first week in June, shows that 36 percent of voters support 
Lula, 17 percent Cardoso, 7 percent Brizola, 5 percent PMDB 
candidate Quercia, 3 percent the PPR's Amin, while only 1 
percent support Liberal Party presidential candidate Flavio 
Rocha. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2036 GMT 14 Jun 
94) 
  Quercia Registers as Presidential Candidate -- PMDB 
President 
Deputy Luiz Henrique registered his party's presidential 
candidate, Orestes Quercia, for the 3 October elections. The 
PMDB estimates that its electoral campaign will cost $58.5 
million. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2202 GMT 8 Jun 
94) 
  Polling Companies To Register at Electoral Board -- 
Companies 
conducting polls on the electoral preferences of Brazilians must 
register at the Superior Electoral Board. They must also 
include in their reports, among several other things, the name 
of the person who requested the poll, its cost, who financed it, 
the methodology used, and the period during which the poll was 
conducted. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1748 GMT 13 
Jun 94) 
<H5>  STATE CAMPAIGNS </H5>
  Front Created in Sao Paulo -- On 1 June the PT made official 
in Sao Paulo the Popular Brazil Front, which supports Federal 
Deputy Jose Dirceu's gubernatorial candidacy. The coalition is 
comprised of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB); the People's 
Socialist Party (PPS); the Communist Party of Brazil (PC do B); 
the Unified Socialist Workers Party (PSTU); the Brazilian 
Communist Party (PCB); and the National Mobilization Party 
(PMN). During the ceremony the candidacy of the PT's Antonio 
Galdino for the Sao Paulo vice governorship was also made 
official, as were the candidacies of Luiza Erundina (PT) and 
Joao Hermann (PSB) for the Senate. The Front will present 141 
candidates for the Sao Paulo Legislative Assembly, and 71 for 
the Chamber of Deputies. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in 
Portuguese 2330 GMT 1 Jun 94) 
  Poll Shows Support of Rio's Gubernatorial Candidates -- The 
Brazilian Public Opinion and Statistics Institute released on 14 
June the figures of a poll, requested by the PSDB, on support 
for Rio de Janeiro's gubernatorial candidates. The figures 
indicate that Marcello Alencar is supported by 31 percent of the 
people, Jorge Bittar and Anthony Garotinho by 14 percent each, 
Newton Cruz by 6 percent, and Milton Goncalves by 5 percent. 
(Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 15 Jun 94 p 8) 
  Article Views Two States' Candidates -- Rio Grande do Sul 
State, which has 5.7 million voters, has four gubernatorial 
candidates, 10 candidates for a seat in the Senate, and 450 
candidates for 31 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 55 seats 
in the Legislative Assembly. These candidates are affiliated to 
13 different political parties. The favorite candidate, however, 
is former Social Security Minister Antonio Britto, the PMDB 
candidate, who will probably be elected governor. In Minas 
Gerais State, five party conventions were held during the 
weekend of 28-29 May. During these conventions the names of 
several gubernatorial candidates were defined. Governor Helio 
Garcia presented former Belo Horizonte Mayor Eduardo Azeredo, of 
the PSDB, as the candidate to succeed him. Former Education 
Secretary Walfrido Mares Guia is the candidate for vice 
governor. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 31 May 94 p 
7) 
  Alagoas Convention Ends at Police Precinct -- The PFL 
convention in Alagoas State, which was held on 28 May, ended at 
a police precinct because Deputy Jose Bernardes, the party's 
former president in that state, pressed charges against PFL 
Secretary Roberto Mendes, who disappeared with the book of acts 
right after the end of the convention. According to Bernardes, 
the book is in the hands of Godofredo Palmeira, brother of 
Senator Guilherme Palmeira, vice presidential candidate on 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO

  [Text] Yesterday, another important group of Armed Forces 
officers presented a second petition challenging the 
constitutionality of the law temporarily suspending their 
political party affiliations. Those who signed the petition are 
Army lieutenant colonels, majors, captains, first lieutenants, 
lieutenants, and sublieutenants. 
  Court sources reported that the petition was signed by 18 
lieutenant colonels, six majors, 31 captains, 42 first 
lieutenants, 12 lieutenants, and four sublieutenants. 
  General Staff spokesmen said that in the next few days Air 
Force and Navy officers will join the group who yesterday filed 
their petition against the law suspending their affiliation. 
<H5>  Same Arguments </H5>
  We could not read the document presented in court. We 
learned, however, that the lawsuit is based on the same 
arguments used by generals and colonels in their lawsuit last 
week. 
  The main arguments used by high-ranking and lower-ranking 
Army officers in their lawsuit is that the law affects their 
acquired rights, and that its effects cannot be retroactive. 
<H5>  "Pancho" de Vargas's Threats </H5>
  Military circle spokesmen said that the threats aired by the 
Chamber of Deputies President Francisco Jose de Vargas against 
those who signed the lawsuit were decisive for many who signed 
the document. 
  Francisco Jose de Vargas suggested he would not approve the 
promotion of officers supporting the challenge against the 
constitutionality of the law on affiliations at the end of this 
year.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Entrepreneurial Speech and Economic Reality"] </F>
  [Text] On the Day of the Entrepreneur, Feprinco [Federation 
for Production, Industry, and Trade] read a message giving broad 
support to Juan Carlos Wasmosy's economic policies, questioning 
Congress' performance, and explaining its differences with 
workers. 
  Entrepreneurs are decisive actors in our country's growth 
and 
in achieving social equality. They must understand that looking 
after the needs of the poorest groups of society seeking a 
juster distribution of wealth is intimately linked to authentic 
development and the ideal of democracy. 
  The Feprinco chairman's 17 June message broadly agrees with 
the official speech, particularly in saying that some government 
initiatives are steps in the right direction; in stressing that 
Congress is laying obstacles to economic reform and blocking the 
approval of bills submitted by the executive branch, 
particularly on privatization; and in emphasizing that the labor 
unions are not supporting the plan of economic stability with 
their demands for inappropriate salary adjustments and calls for 
strikes. 
  This way of seeing reality refers directly to the "machine 
for prevention," which is frequently cited by President Wasmosy 
when people point out his scant economic achievements and his 
even less successful policy in solving social problems. 
  The entrepreneurial leadership is obviously concerned by the 
invasion and plundering of rural properties, which in Feprinco's 
opinion is part of a plan to destabilize the government. But 
entrepreneurs do not deny that the real problem is a very 
unequal land distribution, and that rural development or any 
significant increase in agricultural productivity will not be 
possible as long as the current land distribution scheme 
persists. 
  Feprinco is seriously concerned about the fact that 
demographic pressure on employment "is exploited by some labor 
leaders opposed to changes leading to improved production and 
labor conditions." We, however, must also consider that real 
salary levels cannot be sustained or contribute to encouraging 
productive or commercial activities without regulations because 
of labor market structural conditions and the large and growing 
labor supply. 
  Besides, entrepreneurs continue to link salary increases 
with 
inflation. They call attention to "public company labor leaders' 
insistence in demanding salary increases over and beyond the 
budgetary possibilities." 
  Feprinco, however, is satisfied because "steps are being 
taken to dismantle the inherited state interventionist role," 
because the government is controlling inflation, and because the 
executive branch has produced very important bills, which are 
almost indispensable, to introduce needed changes in the state 
apparatus in order to liberate the economy. 
  The entrepreneurs' speech superficially mentions the need to 
diversify agricultural production and to create an adequate 
legal framework for industrial investments, but it does not 
mention the wish for a deep productive transformation with 
substantial social equality.

    [Editorial Report] Santa Fe de Bogota Emisoras Caracol 
Network in Spanish at 1519 GMT on 22 June broadcasts live in 
progress, from an undisclosed location, a 62-minute news 
conference by Andres Pastrana, former Colombian presidential 
candidate of the New Democratic Force party, with unidentified 
domestic and foreign reporters. 
  Pastrana begins by saying "the president-elect is lying when 
he tried to implicate the campaign of Andres Pastrana and Luis 
Fernando Ramirez in drug trafficking activities." He then adds: 
"That is why I convened this news conference, to set the record 
straight." 
  At 1521 GMT, Pastrana comments on the audio cassette 
recordings of individuals allegedly linking his and 
President-elect Samper's presidential campaigns with drug money. 
He then reads a statement, which begins by noting that "on 15 
June at the Intercontinental Hotel in Cali, upon leaving a 
banquet offered by Valle del Cauca political leaders, a person 
gave me a tape and said it was important." Pastrana then gives 
a chronology of the events leading up to the disclosure of the 
cassette recordings. Pastrana later reads a letter he sent to 
Samper asking him to rebut charges drug money was being used for 
his electoral campaign if there was nothing to hide, "a thing he 
did not do." 
  Pastrana explains he refused to use this recording for 
electoral purposes. He states: "Knowing about this tape before 
the elections, the cassette was not used for electoral 
purposes." At 1530 GMT, Pastrana begins playing a portion of the 
tape recording, with poor reception, of two unidentified 
individuals suggesting that Pastrana's and Samper's campaigns 
received drug money. He stops the recording to note that his 
campaign treasurer had turned down an offer, conveyed by 
journalist Alberto Giraldo, from "some people in Cali who wished 
to donate money for the campaign of Andres Pastrana." Pastrana 
then continues playing the recording of two unidentified men 
discussing possible campaign contributions. 
  After playing the recording, Pastrana says: "At no time does 
the recording refer to donations to my campaign." He then says 
he received a call from the prosecutor general asking him to 
confirm the delivery of the tape to President Gaviria, and he 
says he will confirm this delivery. Pastrana states that "from 
the tapes, it cannot be inferred that my campaign requested or 
received offers of drug money." He states: "If it is proven 
that the Colombian president-elect's campaign received funds 
from drug traffickers, he will relinquish the mandate he 
received from the people; otherwise his credentials will be 
distorted." 
  When asked if he is asking Dr. Samper to resign, Pastrana 
asserts: "If it is confirmed that drug money was used for his 
campaign, he should be ready to resign the presidency as I would 
be if I won the election and if my campaign had received drug 
money." When asked how can he assure he did not receive Cartel 
money, Pastrana says: "Do you think I would go to the president 
of the Republic and tell him, here is a tape that compromises 
me, please investigate me." He continues: "Three days before 
the elections I made a clear proposal. After learning about the 
tape, I said I was willing to resign if it were proven that 
there was drug money in my campaign." 
  Pastrana explains he is not hesitant to surrender the 
accounting books of his campaign, adding: "Those books are 
always open. In my case, we have not only turned the books over 
to the supervisory commission but also to the National Electoral 
Council, which closes out electoral campaign books." When asked 
if he would be willing to cooperate with the Samper 
administration after it is confirmed Samper did not receive drug 
money, Pastrana says: "I personally do not hope to participate 
in the Samper administration." 
  Pastrana asserts: "No one in the world can say my campaign 
was funded by drug money." When asked about General Maza's 
involvement in this episode, Pastrana responds: "This is 
worrisome; there are statements in the recording that are very 
worrisome. It is up to the public to assess these statements." 
  Responding to an indistinct question, Pastrana says: "More 
than thinking about a deterioration of relations with the United 
States, the country demands that this matter be clarified." 
When questioned if he is ready to lead a movement to force the 
resignation of a corrupt president similar to those in Brazil 
and Venezuela, Pastrana says: "I would rather wait for the 
results of the investigation." 
  Pastrana concludes his news conference by saying he has 
received death threats from the drug cartels and by answering 
questions on the upcoming soccer match between Colombia and the 
United States.

<F P=106> [Report by Azucena Lievano from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Today in a communique, President-elect Ernesto 
Samper said he is very concerned about the international 
repercussions of the bold statements made by Andres Pastrana. 
Samper's communique said: "I will not establish an electoral 
dialogue with the candidates defeated in the recent elections." 
  President-elect Ernesto Samper said his position today 
remains unchanged since yesterday. He reiterated the accounting 
books of his campaign are in the hands of the prosecutor, who 
has begun an investigation. He explained that those who are 
involved in irregular actions will not participate in his 
administration. 
  [Begin Samper recording] I want to reiterate my commitment 
to 
having my campaign funds open to review. I also want to 
reiterate my unyielding resolve to continue fighting drug 
trafficking. [end recording] 
  Samper also referred to the journalist implicated in this 
episode. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What kind of 
relationship is there between you or the campaign and the 
journalist? 
  [Samper] None whatsoever. This journalist is not even a 
member of my party. [end recording] 
  Meanwhile, amid the controversy, Samper devoted time today 
to 
the homeless of Cauca Department. The governors of Indian 
communities today requested assistance from President-elect 
Ernesto Samper because, according to them, their living 
conditions following the tragedy are subhuman. 
  Samper met with the homeless who have been relocated to (?La 
Plata de Infalz) and he pledged to develop specific actions, 
through the Agrarian Bank and other institutions, to help them 
get back on their feet and move to safer areas.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Senator Alvaro Pava by </F>
unidentified station announcer in Santa Fe de Bogota and Caracol 
News Director Dario Arizmendi in Los Angeles, California; from 
"Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- live] 
  [Text] Senator Alvaro Pava has been mentioned in a recorded 
conversation which, the government has admitted, included the 
participation of journalist Alberto Giraldo and the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers. The government, which has made a comparison, 
has confirmed the voices in the recording belong to them, 
according to a Defense Ministry communique. 
  During the conversation between Giraldo and one of the 
Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, Giraldo says he had already talked 
with Pava, who had everything arranged. Last night, the "CMI" 
television newscast even reported that Giraldo had telephoned 
the station saying he had received a message from Rodriguez 
Orejuela offering to finance the campaigns of Andres Pastrana 
and Ernesto Samper, an offer which neither of the two candidates 
accepted. According to the "CMI" newscast, Giraldo had said he 
had talked with Pava and Hernandez of the Pastrana campaign and 
Santiago Medina of the Samper campaign but that neither of the 
two campaigns accepted the money the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers 
had offered. 
  We have Pava on the telephone and will ask him what he has 
to 
say about this report linking him to this scandal of the alleged 
participation of tainted money to finance presidential 
campaigns. Good morning, Dr. Pava. 
  [Pava] I am, of course, angry and shocked at the report that 
my name has been mentioned in connection with this type of 
conversation. I am particularly grieved by it. I have been 
listening to remarks by journalists and other people involved. 
The Attorney General's Office and control agencies that are 
determining the authenticity of the recording and the fact that 
it has been confirmed are likewise very important. I have known 
Giraldo for many years, as has the entire country. He is a 
respectable journalist and is a very important man socially. 
  As manager of Dr. Pastrana's campaign, I had no authority to 
collect any money. As Dr. Pastrana will surely explain during 
his news conference at 1000, such a collection was not my 
responsibility. 
  For the good of the country, institutions, and democracy, it 
is important to clarify this bothersome episode, which, 
nevertheless, mars the prestige of Colombian institutions. For 
the good of all, and as the president-elect has said, the 
Attorney General's Office should conduct a thorough 
investigation to confirm, as quickly as possible, that what I 
have said is the truth. It assuages me to know that remarks 
have been made affirming and clarifying the facts. I have 
nothing to fear, but I am very upset that my name was mentioned 
in the cassette. 
  [Announcer] I will now connect you with our news director, 
Dario Arizmendi, who is in the United States. 
  [Arizmendi] I would like you to answer a question that is 
surely in the minds of many fellow countrymen. When Dr. 
Pastrana made a speech at the Tequendama Hotel on 19 June 
admitting his defeat, did he already know of the existence of 
the cassette and that it involved the leaders of the Samper 
campaign in this money deal that was apparently being secured 
through journalist Giraldo? 
  [Pava] Would you please repeat the question? 
  [Announcer] Arizmendi's question is this: On 19 June, when 
Pastrana said it was necessary to determine whether there was 
some participation of tainted money in the presidential 
elections, were the Pastrana campaigners aware of the existence 
of the cassettes disclosed today? 
  [Pava] According to a Defense Ministry communique that was 
released last night, Dr. Pastrana personally handed the 
cassettes with the conversations to the president of the 
Republic on 16 June. An unidentified person had given him the 
cassettes in Cali; therefore, I believe it can be said that he 
was familiar with the text of those recordings and that for this 
reason he revealed them to the authorities so an investigation 
could be conducted. 
  [Arizmendi] Is Giraldo's version as told to the "CMI" 
newscast true that he had talked with you and Dr. (?Veliz) of 
the Pastrana campaign to present the offer of the Rodriguez 
Orejuela brothers to finance the campaign, an offer to which you 
replied no? 
  [Pava] I am not familiar with that version. I could not say 
yes or no to something I did not handle. Giraldo must be 
regarded in the context of his life. You and the country know 
him. Let the people know that Alberto is a journalist who talks 
with political circles everyday. He has excellent relations. 
He is a friend of the president and all the ministers, former 
President Betancur, and the two presidential candidates. He has 
excellent relations and continually talks with the media. He is 
familiarly well-known as Crazy Man Giraldo due to his 
eccentricities. He is very well-known in the country. 
  He is always making inquiries, investigating campaigns. I 
had some responsibility in the campaign, and he was always 
asking me questions about the campaign. In addition, the 
country must know that since 1976 or 1977, he was attached to 
Cadena Radial Super, where I was deputy manager. He was 
assistant director for Javier Ayala, one of the leading Caracol 
journalists and his personal friend. You all know him. Let the 
people know that he is always talking with national leaders, has 
lunch and talks with people. 
  I have talked with Giraldo about the campaign many times but 
not on the subject of money. May I repeat that I had nothing to 
do with it. I did not have to handle that or any other matter 
in the campaign. Of course, morally speaking, I could not 
accept a conversation of that kind. It was proposed to me, and 
I turned it down, of course. I could not hold such a 
conversation for moral principles and because it was not my 
responsibility during the campaign. I did not have to manage 
anything regarding money. My responsibility was a different 
one, as Pastrana will surely affirm during his news conference. 
  [Arizmendi] What will Pastrana say during his news 
conference 
today at 1000? 
  [Pava] I do not know what he will say. You will have to ask 
him. I suppose he will explain the campaign's position, which 
has been very clear. Pastrana's position will not be changed 
either in his public or private life. I suppose this will be 
his position, but I do not know what he will tell the media that 
have been invited to his news conference at 1000. 
  [Arizmendi] How do you interpret Giraldo's remarks that he 
talked with you and Dr. [words indistinct] to offer the money 
that you refused? 
  [Pava] The Attorney General's Office will investigate this 
remark, which upsets me. I expect the Attorney General's Office 
and investigative agencies to establish the truth. May I 
repeat: I could not have accepted any such dialogue because it 
was not my responsibility. If it was proposed to me, surely I 
turned it down, because, morally speaking, I cannot accept such 
a dialogue for obvious reasons. 
  [Arizmendi] What do you think of Samper's initial position? 
Are you satisfied with his explanation? 
  [Pava] I believe the president-elect has spoken clearly. The 
two campaigns should ask the authorities to clarify this matter. 
From the viewpoint of the institutions, this speculation risks 
much regarding the institutions. The country requires absolute 
clarity on the subject. The president has spoken very clearly 
and has inspired confidence in the country regarding management 
of the money the campaign had used. We hope his assertion will 
coincide with the result of the investigation that the proper 
authorities will conduct.

  [Text] Francisco Caraballo, the top EPL [People's 
Liberation Army] leader and one of the most wanted guerrillas in 
the country, reportedly was captured near Santa Fe de Bogota a 
few hours ago. 
  Emisoras Caracol Network has learned that in an operation 
conducted near the capital -- either in Chia or Cajic -- seven 
people, including Caraballo, were apprehended. The Army, with 
the assistance of the National Registrar's Office, is now 
attempting to confirm whether the captured individual is indeed 
Caraballo. A news conference will be held within the next few 
hours by the 13th Infantry Brigade to report on the details of 
this operation. 
  Caraballo, who was active in Cordoba and Antioquia's Uraba 
region, has long been involved in the EPL's war against 
Patriotic Unity in Uraba. He is Fidel Castano's No. 1 enemy 
and, we reiterate, one of the Colombian Army's most wanted 
guerrillas.

<F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The Army has arrested guerrilla leader Francisco 
Caraballo, top leader of the People's Liberation Army [EPL], who 
was being sought by authorities, 10 minutes from Santa Fe de 
Bogota. 
  Troops headed by General Norberto Adrada Cordoba arrested 
top 
EPL leader Francisco Caraballo. The Army mounted an 
intelligence operation two years ago because they knew he had to 
come to Cajiga to visit his wife and son. He arrived last night 
and was arrested this morning. 
  [Begin recording] [Caraballo] When I became a guerrilla, the 
possibilities for joining a legal political movement with the 
opportunity of being a political opposition were closed. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Why did you murder the 
surgeon-priest? 
  [Caraballo] I did not murder him. 
  [Reporter] Why did you order his murder? 
  [Caraballo] I did not order him killed. 
  [Reporter] But you never wanted peace, and you have shown 
you 
do not want peace. 
  [Caraballo] I disagree with that. 
  [Gen. Hernan Jose Guzman] This is a hard blow to the 
guerrillas because in less than 15 days, the Army has arrested 
their commander, their third person in command, and other 
members of the organization. We have also arrested Genaro [not 
further identified], who was the coordinator of their 
activities. [end recording] 
  The arrest of guerrilla leader Francisco Caraballo was the 
result of an intelligence operation conducted by the Colombian 
Army; no reward was paid.

  [Text] Herreraist presidential candidate Juan Andres 
Ramirez yesterday launched the idea of "promoting popular 
capitalism," proposing the creation of a "capital fund, and 
making public savings really useful, encouraging investment, and 
through this boosting productivity." 
  Ramirez listed several bills destined to implement his 
proposal, among which he mentioned the laws for issuance of 
bonds by state enterprises, for regulating the capital market, 
for amending the corporations law, for regulating investment 
funds, and the bill on domestic holdings. 
  Ramirez called on young people to join political parties and 
to vote with responsibility. 
  The candidate delivered a speech at the third Uruguayan 
Marketing Forum at the Municipal Palace yesterday afternoon. In 
the evening he addressed more than 200 youths at a meeting in 
the Herreraist faction headquarters. 
  To the marketing executives, Ramirez used the word "popular 
capitalism," a model that the Christian Democratic Party used in 
Germany after World War II, and which gained publicity during 
Margaret Thatcher's government. 
  The Herreraist candidate explained that there are four basic 
conditions "without which competitiveness and prosperity are 
impossible to achieve." He said the first such condition is that 
"the state should not become an obstacle, with utilities setting 
prices as monopolies and with a heavy tax burden underwriting 
inefficiency." 
  He added that "the laws should not promote inequality, which 
is arbitrary and discretionary" and, as the third condition, 
that "the country cannot be exposed to the ups and downs of 
international trade." 
  He said the fourth condition was "to preserve freedom and 
equality on the market, which are constitutional principles." 
  At the evening meeting with the youths, Ramirez said that 
"the country will not reverse its course, and no one has 
proposed a serious alternative to what we have begun in this 
administration." 
  He added that "beyond the model that the country might 
promote, everyone agrees that the first requirement concerns 
stability and the balance of accounts of the government, which 
should not spend anything over revenues and should not fuel 
inflation needlessly." 
  He claimed that "in no other Latin American country is life 
better than it is in Uruguay," emphasizing that under the 
current administration "the number of people who cannot meet 
their basic needs has dropped 50 percent." 
  Ramirez upheld individual freedom, but warned that "there is 
an ethical foundation for everything, and justice is the first 
objective of society. We must achieve justice," he emphasized.

  [Text] Montevideo, 20 Jun (AFP) -- Former Uruguayan 
President Julio Maria Sanguinetti, who leads all surveys 
measuring the popularity of the presidential candidates in 
November's elections, demanded a "four-year" delay in installing 
the Common Market of the South (Mercosur). 
  "We must be realistic and postpone the implementation of 
Mercosur by four years, in order to be able to complete this 
stage of transition and then begin a stage of preparation," 
Sanguinetti said during a campaign speech. 
  According to the former head of state, Argentina, Brazil, 
Paraguay, and Uruguay, the four Mercosur member countries, "are 
not ready to close an agreement establishing a Common External 
Tariff (AEC)," which is an "essential" prerequisite for a common 
customs union in the region. 
  Macroeconomic differences and the diverging objectives of 
the 
partner nations' productive mechanisms makes it necessary "to 
seek accommodation and a balance in all situations" before 
materializing a common market in America's Southern Cone, 
Sanguinetti warned. 
  "We must compete among ourselves, but we must do it on an 
equal footing, and not before," Sanguinetti added. The remarks 
made by Sanguinetti, one of integration's staunchest supporter 
during his administration (1985-1990), provoked a commotion in 
Uruguay's political and entrepreneurial circles. 
  Uruguay's Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu disagreed with 
Sanguinetti, confirming that "Mercosur is maintaining its 
deadlines." "We are committed to implementing the free trade 
treaty by 1 January 1995. We are working on it," Abreu said. 
  Chamber of Industries spokesmen expressed support for the 
former president's initiative, and issued a communique stressing 
"the urgent need" to postpone the beginning of Mercosur in order 
to complete the retooling of existing plants and be able to 
successfully compete in a more demanding market. 
  The deadlines get closer, but the disagreements among member 
countries on establishing a common AEC continue, as is shown by 
the poor results obtained in Buenos Aires by the four member 
countries' economic vice ministers on 17 June. Spokesmen for the 
meeting said that the representatives "made a lot of progress," 
but admitted there are still some hurdles to clear before 
agreement can be reached on an AEC that will satisfy the four 
Mercosur member countries' governments. 
  Economic analysts consulted by AFP estimated that a free 
trade zone could be installed in the region by 1 January 1995, 
but ruled out the possibility of having a customs union 
consolidating the greatly heralded common market by that date. 
  Four years ago Argentine President Carlos Menem, Uruguayan 
President Luis Alberto Lacalle, then Brazilian President 
Fernando Collor de Mello, and then Paraguayan President Andres 
Rodriguez signed a treaty in Asuncion committing their countries 
to creating a common market in the region by 1995. "We fervently 
support our countries' integration," Sanguinetti said. He 
demanded, however, "prudence" in the handling of the deadlines 
for installing it.

  [Text] Following a round of official talks, PRC President 
Jiang Zemin and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori expressed 
satisfaction over the development of the friendship ties and 
cooperation in the economic, trade, cultural, technical, and 
scientific fields. 
  This was stated in a press note released by the Peruvian 
Foreign Ministry, which states that Peru reasserted its support 
for the principles expressed in the communique on the 
reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Peru and the PRC 
and for "a single China" whose only legal representative is the 
government of the PRC. 
  Peru and China signed an agreement for the promotion and 
protection of investments, a consular agreement, and an 
agreement on export credits for buyers granted by the Bank of 
China to the Republic of Peru. 
  China expressed its wish to further intensify its friendship 
ties with Latin American countries. The two countries mentioned 
points of common interests that will help to develop a link 
between the Pacific Basin and Latin America. 
  After thanking the PRC president, President Fujimori invited 
Jiang Zemin to visit Peru. Jiang Zemin gladly accepted the 
invitation.

  [Excerpt] Beijing -- Yesterday, President Alberto Fujimori 
said that Peru will support China's effort to join the 
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). He said this after 
meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin on his first day of 
his second official visit to China. 
  The presidential talk was held at the Diao Yu Tai house of 
illustrious guests. It lasted two hours. Fujimori said later 
that trade relations will improve if China joins the IDB. The 
proposal to have China join the IDB is also supported by other 
Latin American countries. 
  President Fujimori pointed out how important China is for 
Peru. He said China is the only country where he has paid two 
official visits during his administration. He added Peru wants 
more Chinese technology and called on Chinese companies to 
invest in Peru. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Defunct U.S. radar installations have permitted 
Colombian and Peruvian drug traffickers to once again collect 
drugs in the Upper Huallaga valley, from where they "moved" some 
years ago when the FAP [Peruvian Air Force] began operations 
there. 
  Proof of this is a seizure by Dinandro [Antidrug Division] 
of 
537 kg of cocaine base, weapons, and communications equipment on 
5 June in Biabo district, Bellavista province, San Martin 
department. Biabo, which is on the left bank of the Huallaga 
River, 6 km from Bellavista, had been free of traffickers. The 
traffickers are said to have returned to the area. An individual 
known as "Lucho Tulon" might be one of the big shots. 
  The drugs, weapons, and communications equipment were buried 
in three "cellars" -- a type of silo -- some 500 meters from a 
house that had been raided. This is one of the most important 
events, following the seizure of 3,500 kg of cocaine base in 
Boca Manu, El Diamante, Madre de Dios, and in Inapari. 
  Actions by the Army and the Antidrug Division (Dinandro) of 
the PNP [Peruvian National Police] in coca producing areas in 
Apurimac, Ayacucho, Pasco, and Madre de Dios has helped to drive 
traffickers to Upper Huallaga. 
  As is known, when FAP Tucano planes began operations in 
1992, 
the interception of Colombian traffickers' planes was 
intensified. Some 200 small planes and civil planes are known to 
have been intercepted in coca growing areas since the start of 
FAP operations. 
  FAP Tucano planes operated from illegal airstrips in the 
jungle, helped by the U.S. radar installations in Yurimaguas, 
and the Orion and AWACS planes. 
  As of May, however, the United States suspended radar 
operations leaving FAP Tucano planes without classified 
information to help intercept traffickers' planes. The 
traffickers took advantage of this and have resumed their 
illegal work in the Huallaga region.

  [Text] Lima, 21 Jun (EFE) -- A military source reported 
today that, following the suspension in May of U.S. logistic 
support to combat the transportation of cocaine by air, 
trafficking in Peru has regained what it lost over the past 
couple of years. 
  The source added that drug mafias have increased their 
flights. He said they resumed operating in the Huallaga Valley 
from where they were forced to withdraw in 1993 in view of 
effective repressive operations by the Peruvian Air Force (FAP), 
which operated with the support of U.S. radar installations. 
  Opposition Legislator Julio Castro Gomez has stated that if 
the current level of trafficking flights is maintained, it will 
reach 10,000 by the end of the year. 
  With each flight, the Colombian drug "cartels" transport 
guns 
and money to Peru in exchange for cocaine paste which is later 
transformed into cocaine hydrochloride in Colombian laboratories. 
  Castro Gomez stated that according to official sources, the 
Colombian planes transport between 1,300 to 1,500 metric tons of 
cocaine paste per year, and leave in Peru somewhere between $1.5 
and $2 billion. 
  Trafficking has been back to normal since May when the U.S. 
Government closed down the only fixed radar it operated in Peru. 
It also decided to suspend flights of its AWACS E-3 and Orion 
P-3 planes, equipped with modern flight detection equipment. 
  The U.S. withdrawal, which took Peruvian officials by 
surprise, compelled the Peruvian Government to issue a formal 
protest. They reasserted, however, their firm political 
willingness to continue the antidrug struggle with their own 
resources. 
  Achieving this goal is, however, very difficult because Peru 
lacks the indispensable economic and material means to stop the 
shipments. 
  A high-ranking FAP official has stated that the U.S. 
decision 
"has left us virtually blind. We are frustrated because drug 
traffickers are flying right under our noses and we are unable 
to do anything about it." 
  The same source noted that the only means available to the 
FAP to combat the drug cargoes are four battered T-27 planes, 
two helicopters, and eventually, two more A-37 planes. 
  By comparison, the traffickers are equipped with modern 
planes that can easily dodge FAP planes and make night flights 
with special equipment. 
  The military source stated: "A T-37 flies at 200 knots and 
at 
26,000 feet, while drug mafia planes reach 300 knots and 30,000 
feet." 
  A U.S. technical mission arrived last week in Peru to 
explain 
the reasons for withdrawing its logistic air support. The result 
of the negotiations have been kept strictly secret. 
  The Peruvian press reported, nevertheless, that U.S. support 
was suspended for fear of legal complications for the United 
States in the event of a downing of a civilian plane "by 
mistake." 
  This comes following a recent experience in which a U.S. 
warplane mistakenly shot down two U.S. helicopters in Iraq. 
  The FAP spokesperson stated that U.S. Government's concern 
does not apply in Peru's case because experience has shown that 
the FAP complies with international regulations for the 
interception of planes. 
  He said: "When we intercept a plane we comply with the steps 
of verification, identification, and communication. Only then, 
and if it refuses to comply with orders, do we fire at nonvital 
parts of the plane and, as a last resort, shoot it down." 
  The Peruvian press has reported that it seems the United 
States wants to establish "specific legal guidelines" under 
which Peru will assume full responsibility if a civilian plane 
is mistakenly downed. 
  Some trafficking experts have stated, however, that 
Washington's fears do not justify withdrawing U.S. air logistics 
support from Peru. They added that the U.S. decision "causes 
doubts about its political willingness to combat the issue."

  [Text] London -- Economy Minister Jorge Camet has said that 
Peru wants a Brady Plan-style agreement to reduce the debt it 
owes to banks before the end of the year. He said he hopes to 
conclude negotiations with creditor banks by the end of the 
year, and has great expectations over the amount by which the 
debt might be reduced. He explained that commercial banks have 
taken several provisions to prevent losses in Peru, and that 
consequently the government hopes to make a good deal. Peru owes 
international commercial banks approximately $6 billion, 50 
percent of which is overdue interest. 
  Camet said Peru should be given favorable treatment on 
payment of overdue interest. "We will obviously be granted a big 
discount on capital and interest," he said. 
  The minister noted that the Democratic Constituent Congress 
(CCD) should conclude its investigations into the alleged 
irregularities involving the Mantaro and Pachitea ships in order 
to expedite negotiations over the foreign debt. 
  Talks with Peruvian creditors have been delayed pending a 
resolution by the Chemical Bank and American Express, which 
granted $37 million in credit for buying the ships. 
  Camet explained that the Peruvian Government does not intend 
to return to the international capital markets soon. "Instead of 
borrowing to repay our debt, we must arrange to repay it over a 
long period. Peru has enough reserves for one year of imports. 
Besides, we must repay our rescheduled debt," he said. 
  The minister attended a conference sponsored in London by 
the 
International Herald Tribune and by the Inter-American 
Development Bank. In his lecture, he said that Peruvian 
economic reforms are irreversible, and that the result of the 
presidential elections scheduled for April 1995 will not affect 
them.

explain how the budget was implemented during the first quarter 
of the year, said that he would "clear up the great doubts" the 
people have about how the funds obtained from the privatization 
process are being used. 
  Jalilie started off by explaining that from 1991 up to 7 
June 
of this year, the state has obtained approximately $1.714 
billion from the privatization process, in addition to $3 
million in interest earned by these funds. 
  The vice minister added: "In 1991, the state obtained $1.738 
million; $45 million in 1992; $166 million in 1993; and $1.5 
billion so far this year." "Important companies such as 
Interbanc, Continental, and Lima Electric Power Enterprise will 
be privatized this year. It is therefore quite likely that an 
additional $1 billion will be obtained." 
  Jalilie then itemized the expenditures financed with 
privatization funds, justifying each expenditure with the 
corresponding law. He explained that to date, from the $1.717 
billion (privatization resources plus interest), a total of $242 
million (or the equivalent of 511.9 million Peruvian soles) has 
financed social programs as stipulated in the privatization law. 
There is therefore a surplus of $1.475 billion that has still 
not been used. 
  The 511.9 million soles were spent in the following way: 6.8 
million in 1992, 376.6 million in 1993, and 128.5 million in 
1994. 
  Jalilie explained that "according to the letter of intent 
signed with the IMF, the maximum amount we can use this year 
from the privatization process is $865 million." 
  The 6.8 million soles used in 1992 were earmarked for the 
public universities. The 376.6 million soles used in 1993 were 
for the social projects designed to eradicate poverty executed 
by Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund], 
Pronaa [National Food Assistance Program], and the Education and 
Agriculture Ministries, among other programs, such as those to 
equip the universities, broaden the electricity supply network, 
acquire the Lima thermoelectric plant, build several schools, 
and repair the highway network. 
  In 1994, the 128.5 million soles obtained from the 
privatization process were used for the Glass of Milk program 
implemented by the municipalities, Foncodes, Pronaa, and Infes 
[National Institute of Education and Health Infrastructure]. 
  After this explanation, Jalilie said that social expenditure 
must be interpreted, above all, as an effort to improve the 
living standard, and this is why the state invests in schools, 
universities, etc. The vice minister ended his explanation by 
stating: "The results of this sort of social expenditure will 
appear in the long term." 
  As he left Congress building, Jalilie said that "for the 
time 
being there is no need to reorganize the budget. But at the end 
of the last quarter of the year we will have to make some 
adjustment with a supplementary loan to be coordinated with the 
Budget Commission." 
  In his capacity as president of the National Bank, Jalilie 
also referred to this institution: "A total of 2,000 employees 
have resigned, many more than we expected. As a consequence, the 
National Bank will now operate with only 2,750 employees, as an 
agile, modern, and competitive bank." 
  Regarding the implementation of the budget during the first 
quarter of this year, Vice Minister Alfredo Jalilie, who was 
accompanied by Budget Director Reynaldo Bringas, said that less 
than expected had been spent. During this period the central 
government's income amounted to 2.746 billion soles, while its 
expenditures amounted to 2.686 billion soles, 542.9 million 
soles less than expected. 
  Jalilie commented that "this is normal every year," and 
added 
that "during the first quarter the goals that were set were not 
attained because the disbursements of multilateral organizations 
were delayed until the second quarter of the year. Therefore, a 
series of projects that were being financed with these funds had 
to be postponed." 
  Lastly, Jalilie explained that the "prospects for this year 
are very favorable. We are going to close the year with a 0.6 
percent deficit in the GDP, which had been estimated at 1.8 
percent." 
  In 15 days' time, the Treasury will issue BCR [Central 
Reserve Bank] Capitalization Bonds amounting to 200 million 
soles, which will allow the Central Bank to withdraw the excess 
amount of soles resulting from the purchase of dollars to avoid 
the exchange rate from dropping. 
  Jalilie explained that "with these bonds the BCR will have a 
valid tool for eliminating these soles and thus eliminate the 
fiscal deficit they were generating." 
  The vice minister explained that the AFP's [Pension Fund 
Administration Companies] had insisted on the issuance of those 
bonds for investment purposes as they are profitable, generating 
a monthly interest of 1.8 percent. 
  These 200 million soles are part of the 618 million soles to 
be issued as BCR funds, although the difference will not 
generate interest.

  [Excerpts] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada arrived this 
morning at 0615 at the El Alto international airport. During 
his 11-day trip the Bolivian president visited Cartagena, 
Colombia, where he attended the Ibero-American summit; and the 
United States, where he attended the inauguration of the World 
Cup of soccer. 
  During a news conference after his arrival, the president 
discussed the Bolivian-German soccer match. [passage omitted] 
  The president also referred to the sea outlet issue, which 
was discussed both with Chilean President Eduardo Frei and at 
the foreign ministerial level. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We want to advance at all levels, 
at the cultural, political, and economic levels, so that we can 
succeed in our great objective of achieving an outlet to the 
sea, both through the waterway and to the Pacific Ocean. 
  I believe we had a good meeting, and that there is the 
willingness to continue negotiating. I also explained that we 
want to take specific steps to improve Bolivia's situation. 
[end recording] 
  Regarding capitalization, journalists asked him whether he 
had been able during this trip to obtain more investments. He 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We witnessed real interest in this 
regard in the United States. For example, the Chicago Stock 
Exchange will be sending a delegation to Bolivia. They are 
interested in helping us establish a modern and fully 
computerized stock exchange in Bolivia. 
  I believe things are working out, step by step, in a 
positive 
manner, and that there is good acceptance. Obviously this 
entails a lot of work, but I am optimistic. I believe we are 
obtaining positive results. [end recording] 
  President Sanchez de Lozada said that his administration 
will 
consist of several stages. He said the first stage is that of 
sowing, which is the current stage. 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] This stage consists of preparing 
the soil, of sowing. It is a very austere stage, and people do 
not always see results. Nevertheless it is a necessary stage, 
as there is no harvest without a season of sowing. 
  We are very confident that during the second year of this 
administration we will be able to implement the capitalization 
program. In other words, we estimate that by 6 August 1995 we 
will have completed the capitalization process, and that the 
pension funds will be operating by the end of next year. [end 
recording] 
  The president said that the harvest will be taken in during 
the third year. He said that the last year of his 
administration would be unquestionably a political year. 
  Regarding the latest poll conducted by the Catholic 
University of Bolivia, which indicates that Bolivian public 
opinion believes a president should not also hold the post of 
MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] leader, the president 
said: 
  [Begin Sanchez recording] We have a government system that 
is similar to that of a parliamentary system of government. 
Therefore, if a candidate lacks two-thirds, he has to go to 
Congress and establish a coalition. This is why I am the leader 
of a political coalition. 
  This situation is not at all strange for Spain's Felipe 
Gonzalez, or for German Chancellor Kohl, because if they intend 
to implement their government programs they must be their 
party's leaders and establish coalitions in order to be able to 
govern. [passage omitted] [end recording] [passage omitted]

  [Text] Military sources at the Miraflores barracks in La 
Paz disclosed yesterday, 13 June, that "all members of Army 
Divisions, Air Brigades, and Navy Units, during the past few 
hours have expressed their firm support for Armed Forces 
Commander General Fernando Sanjines Yanez." 
  The military sources were asked about the "replacement of 
the 
commander in chief." They told LOS TIEMPOS today that "nothing 
significant will happen during the next few days with the high 
military command now that Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the 
president of the Republic and general commander of the Armed 
Forces, has ratified his confidence in the military commander." 
  The source stated: "The military garrisons were surprised by 
the military prosecutor's recommendation to try General Fernando 
Sanjines for allegedly being involved in the sale of material 
and spare parts belonging to the Bolivian Air Forces in 1992." 
  Just hours after Military Prosecutor Ezequiel Block's 
recommendation was disclosed, the high military command was 
shaken by an unusual movement of troops, and it was rumored that 
"the commander in chief would be replaced immediately." 
  The situation was clarified at a high level after the 
president of the Republic "ratified his confidence in Sanjines 
as commander in chief of the Armed Forces."

  [Text] Exactly at 0800 on 14 April 1994, about 20 
high-ranking active-duty and retired generals arrived at the 
Major Andres de Santa Cruz Command and General Staff School in 
La Paz to begin an important meeting. The officers arrived with 
grim faces, impeccable uniforms, cordial greetings, and an air 
of general concern. They then began a heated debate on the 
issue that causes most concern among Bolivian military officers: 
The existence of an international strategy against them. The 
main issues that create concern among Bolivian military officers 
are the alleged U.S. intention to create a transnational Armed 
Forces under the command of the United Nations and a 
"suggestion" by international financial organizations to cut 
defense budgets in developing countries. 
  The delegates discussed the extreme concern which has 
overtaken Bolivian military officers in the last few months over 
the imminent reduction of the Armed Forces as part of a U.S. 
plan to establish a hemispheric security organization. 
  More than 20 active-duty and retired officers were summoned 
from different parts of the country to study this issue on 14 
and 15 April in a seminar entitled "Military Affair: The Plot to 
Destroy the Armed Forces and the Ibero-American Countries," the 
conclusions of which have been obtained by this daily. 
  The 70-page document reflects the concern of high-ranking 
Bolivian military officers and identifies the U.S. Government as 
the brains behind the idea of cutting the Armed Forces in Latin 
America, while the World Bank and the IMF are behind the alleged 
imposition of cuts in military spending. 
  The seminar, which was also attended by Argentine and 
Peruvian military chiefs, was held just a month and a half 
before the UNDP [United Nations Development Program] director 
officially announced a proposal to reduce military spending 
around the world as of 1995. 
  In a bulletin released by the U.S. Embassy on 4 June in La 
Paz, UNDP Director James Gustave Speth said: "Spending on human 
needs must take priority over military spending in the post cold 
war era." 
  Apparently Speth's proposal has the support of Washington, 
whose spokesmen in La Paz announced that the proposal will be 
evaluated and probably enforced during the "UN Social Summit in 
1995 through the creation of the World Demilitarization Fund." 
  Speth said countries attending the summit must promise to 
reduce by 3 percent per annum their military budget as of next 
year. 
  Furthermore, the U.S. Embassy announced through its 
information service that in its 1994 report, the UNDP asked the 
United States and other powers to gradually eliminate all 
military aid programs to developing countries within three years 
and to relate their economic cooperation to the defense budgets 
of those countries. 
  Within this context, participants of the seminar confirmed 
to 
this daily the "undeniable" concern of the Armed Forces as seen 
in the conclusions of the seminar. 
  The military meeting opened with a speech by the most 
outstanding retired military officer who, without much protocol, 
became fully involved in studying eight essential points: 
  The history of the anti-military project, with a special 
annex; the current war fronts; the Bush manual on abolishing the 
Armed Forces; restricted sovereignty: objectives of 
Inter-American dialogue; "corrupt" democracies: the weapon of 
the Trilateral Commission; depopulation: the official U.S. 
policy; "technological apartheid:" the new economic colonialism; 
supranational government: and the reorganization of the United 
Nations in its new role. 
  Nine proposals were submitted for evaluation: 
  a. The plot 
  b. The demilitarization project 
  c. Historic background of the Latin American Armed Forces 
and their mission 
  d. Democracy 
  e. The technological apartheid: new economic colonialism 
  f. Supranational government: UN reorganization for its new 
role 
  g. Democracy 
  h. Economic background 
  i. The positive contribution of the Armed Forces for the 
consolidation and affirmation of democracy in Bolivia. 
  Based on this broad agenda, a two-day heated debate came to 
the conclusion that there are undeniable signs of foreign 
policies that seek to destroy, or at least reduce, the Bolivian 
and Latin American Armed Forces. 
  The military commanders agree that the danger lies basically 
in the gradual reduction of national defense budgets and the 
subsequent creation of a supra-national military force 
subordinated to the United Nations that will replace national 
military institutions. 
  One officer who attended the meeting said: "The United 
States 
believes the only purpose of Latin American Armed Forces is to 
safeguard internal order from communism which, following changes 
in the world political order, is no longer justified." 
  The officers believe that as the antagonism between the 
United States and the Soviet Union no longer exists, "Washington 
believes Latin American countries should acknowledge U.S. 
structures in the political, social, economic, and military 
fields as the only legitimate ones." 
  He warned that as a result of this, some powers will try to 
create supranational forces to replace the Armed Forces of the 
so-called poor countries. 
  The same officer said: "The creation of supranational forces 
-- which involves only two or three countries -- would mean 
other countries would be subordinated to those who form the 
supranational forces because they would hold the military power." 
  An active-duty general who attended the meeting said: "The 
process to eliminate the Armed Forces is a rehash of the plan 
proposed by the United States in 1992 during the conference 
entitled `Inter-American Dialogue.'" 
  He reiterated that the initiative seeks to create a 
supranational force in charge of safeguarding regional security. 
  He added that the "Democracy Project," promoted by the U.S. 
Government foresees the elimination of the Armed Forces "as the 
Bush Plan did," and reveals two other plans, one secret and one 
public, sponsored by the "National Fund for Democracy." 
  The secret plan allegedly refers to the struggle against 
drug 
trafficking, and the public one to the fact that the Latin 
American countries must accept decisions of the IMF, World Bank, 
and others. 
  He said: "These projects must be accepted by Latin American 
governments because refusing to do so would result in 
authoritarian governments." 
  The officers are suspicious of the so-called U.S. 
cooperation, doubting the unclear intention of this type of 
initiative. 
  A colonel with a degree in higher military studies noted the 
existence of direct foreign intervention "under the pretext of 
giving advice," especially in the struggle against trafficking. 
  He asserted: "Intervention is by no means justified, not 
even 
from the economic viewpoint because the contribution is minimal." 
  He referred to the low level of morale in the Armed Forces 
which basically follows the lack of prospects within the 
profession, the economic situation, and the lack of incentives. 
  Another retired general summarized how the United States 
will -- or hopes to -- control South American countries through 
the possession of islands and countries like Chile "which has 
growing economic influence over other countries of the Pacific." 
  He added that in the Caribbean the control could be carried 
out through Venezuela and/or Brazil, thus influencing the 
northernmost point of the continent, the Caribbean, and the 
Atlantic. 
  He also expressed his concern that "Chile would control the 
South American Antarctic region." 
  The general added: "There could be an invasion like that in 
Panama, but this time against Bolivia and Peru using as a 
pretext trafficking and the large coca plantations that could be 
linked to terrorism." 
  He added: "Latin American countries did not bleed in the 
great wars, therefore this type of action may be deemed 
necessary. As an example one could consider what happens to 
street children in Brazil and Colombia." 
  The conclusions reached by the seminar are the following: 
  "1. The creation of supranational forces is one of the 
greatest threats to the Latin American countries and their Armed 
Forces because, if such forces exist, we could be intervened in 
militarily in accordance with the interests and policies of the 
countries that make up this force. 
  "2. Although restricted sovereignty is a fact that cannot be 
denied, it should be controlled in such a way to find limits 
that would allow us freedom to solve our internal problems. 
  "3. International economic organizations like the IMF, the 
World Bank, and other organizations currently direct the Latin 
American economic system and set the guidelines for the budgets 
of the Armed Forces of the different countries. 
  "4. The book "El Complot" ["The Plot," not further 
identified] should be considered, but it is necessary to 
remember it is somewhat subjective and should only be treated as 
the opinion of people with their own criteria. 
  "5. Because of different circumstances, like the policies of 
the regimes before the new order was established and the current 
conditions by which the military power is subordinated to the 
political power, military commands are believed to be isolated 
from the general activities of the nation. The Armed Forces 
have thus lost the influence they should have. 
  "6. As a means of self-protection, Latin American countries 
must reach a political agreement considering the interests of 
countries of the continent. 
  "7. Private business have, at certain times during the 
national policy, supported the actions of the Armed Forces as 
the only way to solve economic problems, but now under the 
influence of a new international order that is against the Armed 
Forces, private businesses reject and are even against them. 
  "8. The Armed Forces should urgently develop a real policy 
to 
increase their budget and to implement feasible self-financing 
projects in accordance with the real situation of the country. 
It is also necessary to carry out an economic reorganization to 
redistribute the budget in accordance with current priority 
needs. 
  "9. It cannot be denied there is a policy to destroy the 
Latin American Armed Forces, initially by transferring their 
mission to other institutions which later in accordance with the 
needs of the great powers will also disappear to allow 
supranational forces to take over internal and external 
security."

  [Text] La Paz, 15 Jun (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Bolivian Air Force 
Commander General Jose Perez Reyes Ortiz officially announced 
today "the merger of the commercial activities of TAM (Military 
Air Transport) and TAB (Bolivian Air Transport) under the legal 
guidelines of the Capitalization Law on the main strategic state 
companies. [no closing quotation marks as published] 
  Gen. Perez Reyes made this announcement during the 49th 
anniversary of the 71st Air Group in La Paz today. 
  He said: "With the entire support of military aviation, we 
are witnessing the end of the cycle of TAM as an operational 
unit, and the beginning of a new stage with TAB." He added: 
"This is how a real commercial air enterprise is created, 
operating within the legal regulations prevailing in the 
country." 
  "Thanks to the impetus and effort of a generation of 
military 
aviators (...) we are carrying out this objective with a new 
command policy, in accordance with the changes demanded by this 
historic moment," said Gen. Perez Reyes during the ceremony. 
  Gen. Perez Reyes, who was addressing acting President Victor 
Hugo Cardenas, cabinet ministers, and the high military command, 
said: "The 71st Air Group has been reactivated with a new 
strategy." 
  He also mentioned the logistical tasks to be carried out by 
the air brigade, such as "its participation in support 
operations against drug trafficking, air missions in support of 
the Army and the Navy, and support for civilian society in civic 
action programs." 
  He said that to carry out the short, medium, and long-term 
objectives drawn up by his general command, "creative 
organizational measures are being taken in transferring the 
commercialization activities of TAM to TAB." 
  Gen. Perez Reyes said: "This decentralized entity of the Air 
Force, in accordance with its legal status (...), has great 
administrative and financial capabilities which we are certain 
will help in its economic recovery through fresh resources to be 
obtained from different channels." 
  He said there is an economic advantage due to "the 
effectiveness of Air Force personnel, and due other financing" 
that can be obtained from private national and even 
international sectors.

  [Excerpt] Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe 
Subieta, who will today hear the sentence of their impeachment 
in Congress, yesterday announced an international campaign to 
file a request for their acquittal before the San Jose de Costa 
Rica Human Rights Court. 
  During a news conference the Supreme Court justices asserted 
that a struggle for the "dignity and complete independence of 
the judicial branch" has begun, and at the same time they 
accepted "serving their imprisonment sentences [as published] 
humbly, in the certainty of winning awareness in the Bolivian 
court." 
  The justices, tried by the national Congress' Special Court, 
were yesterday feted and honored by the La Paz District Court 
alternate members, judges, and administrative personnel in a 
simple ceremony that ended in a news conference. 
  Both Oblitas and Poppe admitted this was the last public 
event they would attend in their capacity as justices, as they 
announced that the government has decided to sentence them to 
the highest penalty established by the Impeachment Law that is 
sponsored by the U.S. Embassy. 
  Oblitas said: "The justices and their lawyers have shown the 
country, irrefutably and clearly, that neither of the two have 
committed any crime, and that this is an irrational impeachment 
seeking only to replace the Supreme Court justices with 
subservient justices who will obey the government's orders."

<F P=106> [By special correspondent] </F>
  [Text] La Paz -- Minister of Government German Quiroga 
Gomez has stated that due to current coca prices (180 Bolivian 
pesos per load), it is impossible to successfully implement an 
alternative development program in the Chapare region. Quiroga 
said that in view of this it is indispensable to increase drug 
enforcement in this region. Ten years of statistics show that 
by increasing interdiction, market values decrease and more 
peasants decide to resort to alternative products. 
  Quiroga said that currently there are virtually no valid 
arguments to convince coca growers to replace their crops, 
because it is not economically profitable. 
  Quiroga delivered a speech during the opening ceremony of 
the 
Seminar on Alternative Development sponsored by the U.S. 
Embassy's USIS in conjunction with the Social Defense 
Undersecretariat and the La Paz Journalists Association. The 
seminar was held for around 20 journalists from several 
departments who are traveling today to Chapare to observe the 
development of banana, citrus fruit, and pineapple plantations 
and the like. 
  Quiroga added that peasants would be willing to replace 
their 
excess coca crops when they were convinced it was more 
profitable to produce other crops. He said that for farmers it 
is a question of opportunity and necessity, and that it is 
essential to take this into account to achieve proper levels of 
alternative development. Quiroga stated: "It is meaningless to 
invest in infrastructure and equipment in the Chapare region if 
it is not profitable for coca growers to switch crops." 
  Quiroga said: "With current prices, we will never be able to 
replace coca farming if we exclusively rely on the good will of 
coca growers, and Bolivia will continue to be the second largest 
drug producer." 
  Quiroga explained that the current policy of control of 
dangerous substances groups under one single unit the three 
aspects of drug enforcement (interdiction, alternative 
development, and drug prevention). He said that from this point 
of view the Ministry of Government will implement alternative 
development and peasant education programs wherever there are 
interdiction and drug enforcement programs. 
  Quiroga said it is regrettable that in Bolivia the only 
newsworthy articles are those related to trafficking activities 
in what he described as the "bad Chapare" region, and that this 
represents only 20 percent of the population. He said that the 
remaining 80 percent has either always been devoted to legal 
activities or is voluntarily replacing its excess coca crops. 
  He added that five years ago the Chapare region only 
produced 
coca that was sold in the market. Quiroga said that nowadays 
coca is neither transported nor marketed. He said that instead 
cocaine paste is being produced on nearby plantations, because 
peasants have available the technical facilities to macerate 
coca. Sixty percent of the coca growers in the Cochabamba 
tropical region are involved in drug trafficking. Quiroga 
warned that "we have a time bomb on our hands." 
  Moreover, Social Defense Under Secretary Mario Soliz said 
that, through an agreement approved by the COB [Bolivian Labor 
Federation] on 23 March, coca growers have agreed to eradicate 
5,000 hectares of coca by the end of the year, and that they are 
therefore obliged to comply with this. Soliz said that the 
government is empowered to exercise interdiction mechanisms if 
this goal is not achieved. He added, however, that the current 
policy favors dialogue with coca producers, as there is no 
intention of turning the alternative development program into a 
violent issue, and even less of turning against the peasants.

<F P=106> [News conference by President Fidel Castro with unidentified </F>
domestic correspondents at the conclusion of the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 16 
June -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Commander, how does this summit 
differ from previous summits? 
  [Castro] I cannot say that there are paramount differences 
between summits. Progress was made at all of them, and 
altogether they represent something positive. The summits are 
being honed. We are never fully satisfied with everything 
discussed or said at the summits. Yet, the fact that the 
summits are taking place is an important step in Latin American 
history. As I told representatives of the solidarity groups 
today, it is the first time in history that we have met or held 
meetings without consulting third party countries because this 
is the fourth meeting we have held. 
  These Latin American summits have been consolidated; they 
have been institutionalized. Each one has made a contribution, 
fostered certain accords, and promoted specific results. There 
are specific results and a general result. They have fostered 
greater awareness, understanding, and a spirit of cooperation 
among Latin American leaders. This is reflected in the diverse 
steps the Latin American peoples are taking toward integration. 
The value of the summits does not lie in what is accomplished, 
but in what is fostered. The summits have truly fostered a lot. 
  I liked this summit. Guadalajara was first; Rio was also 
good; some things came out of Spain. The Caribbean atmosphere, 
Cartagena's atmosphere, hospitality, spirit -- although also 
present in Rio and Guadalajara -- contributed to this summit. 
We felt closer to our climate and character. 
  You can see how important these summits are by the fact that 
they have prompted the Miami summit. Our northern neighbors are 
worried and envious of the fact that this movement continues to 
advance and has attained specific results in establishing 
subregional integration mechanisms. Therefore, they want to 
have their own. We do not know if they want to hold it 
annually. Of course, they began by excluding us, which is a 
clear act of cowardice. They fear debate and discussion. They 
fear the truth. 
  They know that I would go to the summit even if it were held 
in the very city of Miami. I would go to the summit [words 
indistinct] because it is an opportunity. One cannot reject an 
opportunity to have the Latin American and Caribbean peoples go 
there and talk with the alleged masters of this hemisphere. I 
hope they have enough spirit and courage. There are always 
certain courageous men that will express certain truths at that 
summit and defend the many interests of Latin America and the 
Caribbean. 
  This summit has the characteristic that it was held before 
that one, although nothing was actually said about that summit 
because one of the goals in a summit like this is to discuss 
what Latin America will jointly propose there, in Florida. The 
issue was not discussed, however. That would be asking too 
much. Nevertheless, I decided to dedicate practically 
three-quarters or, better yet, my entire speech to analyzing 
that fundamental issue, the Miami summit, and to introducing 
some ideas, which you have heard. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, Cuba has been present at the four 
summits. What has Cuba's contribution been in these summits and 
how have these summits benefited Cuba? 
  [Castro] Well, I would say that Cuba has made a contribution 
with its very presence. Its presence there is something that is 
exceptional, new, and unprecedented. For the first time, there 
was no exclusion. Mexico had much to do with that, as well as 
our other important Latin American friends. Therefore, Cuba's 
presence gives the summit more seriousness and dignity because 
the cowardly exclusion is no longer committed. 
  Cuba freely stated its viewpoint, opinion, and criterion. 
You know how these summits are: there is a public part and a 
private part; you speak once and you speak many other times. 
Cuba has participated in all the meetings on different issues. 
It pointed out the importance of education, health care, 
scientific research, and social development. We can say today 
that social development issues are gaining importance at these 
summits. We can say that one of the characteristics of this 
summit was that we finally began to speak of social development 
and to talk extensively. 
  Cuba's presence helps this. We have truly striven to lift 
the spirit of the summits and to give them substance. The Cuban 
delegation has nothing to regret about each of its statements at 
these summits. All of these summits have been serious, correct, 
and just, particularly this summit since we face the famous 
Miami summit. We began to discuss the Miami summit. These 
summits have obviously created an awareness. 
  One of the fruits is that they have created an awareness 
about integration. We should not measure them by material 
things as much as by the awareness they have created and the 
rapprochement they have caused, the contacts they have 
originated between Latin American leaders. This is what I say 
the summits have obtained from Cuba's modest contribution. Cuba 
has made a modest contribution in these areas. 
  You asked about contributions to Cuba. The summits have 
helped counter Cuba's isolation and create an awareness against 
the blockade. They have helped teach the United States a 
lesson. They make its decision to exclude Cuba even more 
ridiculous. In other words, Cuba has also enjoyed the benefits. 
It has improved its relations with Latin America, and it has 
found a more favorable atmopshere for economic relations and 
trade in many areas. The summits have allowed us to establish 
contacts with many Latin American leaders, politicians, and many 
valuable people in the political sector. This has helped Cuba 
get closer to Latin America and develop its relations with Latin 
America. Those are some of the benefits for Cuba. I cannot 
tell you there have been specific economic and material results, 
but great results have been immediately evident. We are working 
not only for the present, but also for the future. Even then, 
Cuba achieved important results at these Latin American summits. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, even when the main topic of this 
summit was the Latin American economy and integration, in your 
opinion, what are the greatest obstacles which currently prevent 
Latin America's integration? 
  [Castro] The United States is the main obstable. The United 
States wants to disintegrate it. The United States opposes real 
Latin American integration, where Latin American countries move 
on their own and as independently as possible toward 
integration. The United States sponsors bilateral integration 
with different Latin American countries. Almost the same thing 
happened with the external debt. The United States refused to 
allow a coordinated Latin American discussion. The United 
States does not want to allow a coordinated discussion in Latin 
America. It wants to reach agreements with countries, one by 
one, to adjust them to its specific interests and, in this way, 
prevent true Latin American unity. 
  What happens is the United States wants one thing, and 
another thing may happen because the Latin American countries 
are reaching many bilateral agreements on their own. Mexico is 
sponsoring bilateral free trade agreements with several Latin 
American countries. It has already done this with Chile, 
despite Mexico's participation in the famous NAFTA. It has just 
signed an agreement with Venezuela and Colombia. The Group of 
Three also entails free trade. Therefore, ideas about free 
trade and Latin American integration are making way little by 
little. 
  Of course, all this takes place amid a struggle between 
blocs. Europe looks at the U.S. attempt to become the owner of 
the Latin American markets with mistrust. Although it is true 
that Mexico carries out most of its trade with the United 
States, South Americans carry out approximately 20 percent or 
less -- I cannot recall the exact figure right now -- of their 
trade with the United States. South American countries carry 
out important trade with the rest of the world and important 
trade with Europe. Of course, that counters hegemonic U.S. 
interests and its plans to seize control of the Latin American 
markets. 
  This Miami summit could be very interesting if it addresses 
all these things. That is why I said in my address that I hope 
those issues are discussed and that if it only adopts measures 
to dominate, seize control of the Latin American markets, 
isolate Cuba, and eliminate Europe, Japan, and other areas from 
trade with Latin America, then the time will come -- as Marti 
said --to declare Latin America's second independence. The 
truth is that all this entails a conflict. I do not think the 
other blocs will fail to put up a fight even though GATT has 
already been established. GATT still has many weak points. The 
impositions by the great powers, mainly the United States, were 
strong, particularly in the area of services and intellectual 
copyright. All this must be analyzed better because agreements 
were reached. Those agreements represent some advantages, but 
those agreements were undoubtedly more advantages for the larger 
blocs and the United States. 
  Obviously, it would like to monopolize trade in its 
backyard, 
namely Latin America. Latin America knows this. That is why we 
welcome the fact that Mexico is sponsoring free trade 
agreements. We welcome the fact that the Latin American 
Integration Association, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], 
the Central American Common Market, and the Andean Group are 
advancing. Let us say they are subregional organizations that 
seek subregional integration. It is good they prosper because 
they, thus, become a form of resistance to the great effort to 
swallow the Latin American and Caribbean markets and to impose 
the U.S. conditions, which would give it the greater advantage. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, the Cartagena summit provided 
tremendous support to subregional economic organizations as you 
have just mentioned. Do you think this is a tendency that might 
continue developing on the continent, and do you think this 
tendency would form part of the Latin American economic 
integration strategy? Another question I would like to ask: If 
Latin America were to present a united front at the hemispheric 
summit summoned by the United States, in your opinion, what 
issues should it discuss? 
  [Castro] Well, your question is very long. First of all, 
Latin America's interest and effort toward subregional economic 
organizations has come about naturally, spontaneously, and 
instinctively. Whether that becomes a strategy of the Latin 
American summits is something else. This remains to be seen, but 
I believe it is bound to be a more important player. 
  On the strategy that I think we should follow -- and I say 
this as an absentee-Latin American to the Miami summit, of which 
I spoke in my speech -- many of these issues would be a bit too 
long to detail, but there are important aspects. We said that 
resolution No. 301 should be rescinded and not used as a 
negotiation weapon, as is the issue of intellectual property. We 
must find a definite solution to the problem of the debt and the 
fact that more aid is needed for development. We could add many 
other things. The issue of unfair trade should be discussed in 
more depth. 
  In just 12 years, Latin America has paid more than $700 
billion, for two reasons only: First, in payment of the foreign 
debt; and second, because of unfair trade during the past 12 
years. It has lost more than $700 billion because of these two 
things, in just 12 years. This is without including capital 
drain. I believe these are important issues and ought to be 
discussed at that summit. There are many other issues, but we 
are speaking of economic factors. I do not want to speak long 
because I already mentioned all these things. I put emphasis on 
the issue of social development. I also mentioned the 
seriousness, the graveness of the dismissal of human rights, as 
important as the rights to education, health, the right to work, 
the peoples' right to dignity and to their ethnic and cultural 
identity. I spoke about the defense of sovereignty, the 
principle of nonintervention in Latin American affairs, 
renunciation of the pretexts that are increasingly used to 
meddle in domestic affairs, such as the drug trafficking 
problem. This should not serve to allow the United States to 
limit the sovereignty of Latin American nations and turn their 
armies into police forces. 
  In other words, there are economic aspects as well as 
political aspects. I stressed that if it is true, as they said, 
that they seek to establish more mature relations, and to close 
their bases in Latin America, they should not forget to close 
down the Guantanamo base, meet their accords, and withdraw their 
forces from Panama and any other country. There are many 
security, political, and economic problems to discuss at that 
summit. If they want the opinions of the nongovernmental 
organizations, they ought to ask the opinion of all -- the 
indigenous peoples, women's groups, and unions, without 
excluding any, as well as civilian organizations. There are 
entire world of things to be discussed there. [passage 
indistinct] 
  I advocated the Latin American discussion [30 second break 
in 
reception] that it not be allowed to become another catch phrase 
of the day. I am glad that as a result of the summits we have 
held independently, free from third party meddling and without 
asking anyone's permission, they have been forced to summon the 
Miami summit. They could have, of course, selected a different 
city. Miami was chosen. They did not hide the fact that it is 
part of a political ploy responding to U.S. domestic politics, 
and once again, returning to their loathsome exclusion in the 
end reflects -- I repeat -- political cowardice, lack of valor 
to face the debate, lack of valor to face the truth. They do not 
want to catch sight of anything like my uniform or guayaberas. 
  [Correspondent] All these U.S. political views, however, are 
grounded in the basis of a so-called democracy. You also said at 
the summit that much could be said about democracy, or even that 
a summit on democracy could be organized. What is the true level 
that democracy should have in Latin America? 
  [Castro] This is a difficult issue because we held some 
closed door meetings. I, however, spoke about concepts of 
democracy and said democracy cannot exist without equality, 
without fraternity, and without social justice. I spoke of the 
Athenian democracy, which had 30,000 free citizens and 70,000 
slaves. 
  I mentioned some of these things. I had no choice but to 
explain certain concepts, to ratify my principles and beliefs, 
and to mention Carl Marx, his theories and hope for the 
disappearance of the state. I mentioned that there are countries 
that remind me of that Greek democracy. I am simply giving you a 
glimpse. I do not want to be indiscreet. I simply want to say 
that I spoke and spoke with firmness and conviction about some 
of these ideas. 
  I also had to point out some things about Cuba, such as our 
institutionalization; our Constitution, approved by over 90 
percent of the citizens; and our electoral system. At times, 
they talk as if Cuba is not a state of law, or has no 
Constitution or elections. This lack of knowledge then becomes 
an axiom. I was forced to speak very clearly about some of these 
concepts, above all, in light of certain superficial, cliche 
comments regarding these concepts. I, however, do not want to 
say anything more or they will say I am a (?blabbermouth). 
  [Correspondent] Commander, again regarding the Miami summit: 
Do you think that some of the presidents in attendance might 
bring up the issue of the U.S. blockade against Cuba? 
  [Castro] Well, that was already brought up in Cartagena by 
Brazilian President Itamar Franco. He rejected the blockade. 
Now, we will wait and see how the summit goes. I can imagine. I 
do not know how many minutes each speaker will have. It involves 
many people, and if organizing these summits, which include 
about 20 countries, is difficult, when you add all the others, 
who knows how it is going to come out. I do not know how long 
Clinton will speak or how long the others will speak, or the 
agenda, or the pressures that the far right might try to exert 
there. It is not bad, however, for the leaders of Latin America 
and the Caribbean to get to know Miami. 
  There are many good people and many good Cubans in Miami. 
There is a Puerto Rican population, and Mexicans, and 
Colombians, and many others from many parts of Latin America. 
They will also get to see, however, the mafia of fascist 
gangsters of Cuban origin who own the city by virtue of their 
financial might, terror, and the political lobbying conducted 
through the media under their control. It is a good chance for 
them to see this. 
  There are many other places. I believe it would have been 
more politically correct for the United States, in wanting to 
summon a summit, to choose a Latin American country. That would 
have highly pleased the Latin American peoples. They, the owners 
of the hemisphere, are seeking to turn Miami, however, into the 
capital of the hemisphere. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, the convergence of regional 
integration schemes as a way to attain the definitive 
integration of Latin America was discussed at this summit. Of 
the 21 Latin American countries, I believe that all except Cuba 
are involved in some regional integration commerce scheme, such 
as Mercosur, the Andean Pact, the EU [European Union] in the 
case of Spain and Portugal, and the Central American Common 
Market. How do you see.... 
  [Castro, interrupting] We are tactically in the South. We 
belong to the Latin American Economic System, SELA. Do not 
forget. 
  [Correspondent] Yes, however, from the commercial point of 
view, do you see in the near future a possibility.... 
  [Castro, interrupting] We still do not have [words 
indistinct]. We have to think about this. We have to discuss 
this. The most appropriate time, however, for this is yet to 
come. Logically, we have to attain these goals and objectives. 
We have to become integrated. The important thing is for 
integration to develop, to come to fruition. Without 
integration, there will be nothing to integrate. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, how did the other heads of state 
react to your second, historic address? 
  [Castro] What second, historic address? 
  [Correspondent] When you addressed them at the end of the 
first day. 
  [Castro] Well, they listened with respect. I said several 
truths. I said: This and this, and these points have not been 
discussed. I, however, do not want to talk about the second 
address which was longer. It lasted 25 minutes. 
  [Correspondent] That was the closed-door one. 
  [Castro] I had already hinted at some of the things 
regarding 
democracy that I had no choice but to discuss. I, however, do 
not want to reveal anything else about the content of the talks 
or I would be breaking my word. I do not know what the others 
will do, or how much they will say, but I have to respect my 
commitment to be as discreet as possible regarding the content 
of the closed-door meeting. 
  [Correspondent] There were many presidents who said 
farewell during this summit and others who participated for the 
first time. What is your impression of these new voices in the 
summit and bilateral meetings? 
  [Castro] In general, positive. In general, they are 
intelligent people. Some are more outstanding than others. Some 
have clearer views. Some speak in more specific terms. This is 
so of the older ones as well as the new ones. In general, they 
are intelligent people, capable people, who express themselves 
well. 
  [Correspondent] What were the results of the bilateral 
meetings? 
  [Castro] [Words indistinct] great kindness, a growing 
kindness from everyone, with no exceptions. This is what I 
noticed. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, what about the presence of U.S. 
observers at this summit? 
  [Castro] I think that those who are trying to organize the 
Miami summit were trying to learn how this summit was organized. 
I do not know. This one was difficult to organize. They wanted 
to include too many things in the agenda. The Colombian 
organizers truly worked hard to organize the summit as well as 
possible. From the beginning, we saw the agenda was overloaded, 
intense. I was afraid there might be delays, and it happened. By 
the end of the first day, we had not completed the discussions 
on the first point. Later on, 10-minute coffee breaks lasted 
half an hour or 35 minutes. There were dinners, and lunches in 
various locations. We had to go by boat, travel, return, then 
have recesses and fulfill many engagements. 
  Everything was scheduled precisely, but in general, in this 
type of thing, schedules are not fully met. I would say it was 
more disciplined than the nonaligned meetings and everyone was 
usually present at the beginning of the meetings. These summits 
are much smaller. A summit with 22 heads of state is not the 
same as a meeting of 100. The Colombian Government made a great 
effort, and selected a good site despite the fact that it did so 
close to two other important events: elections next Sunday [19 
June] and the World Soccer Cup. There are many soccer fans. At 
least many people did get to focus on the summit while it was 
being held, and act accordingly. 
  You had asked me about.... 
  [Correspondent, interrupting] About the presence of U.S. 
observers. 
  [Castro] That is what we were talking about. They came to 
learn. That is what they say. I would truly like to see how they 
organize the Miami summit. This makes me curious: how many 
minutes each speaker will have, how long it will last, how it 
will work. I do not know if they will put people out in space 
for this and do spectacular things like they did during the 
Olympics. We will see [snickers] how far the Americans' common 
sense goes. 
  [Correspondent] The Caribbean States Association is going to 
be created at the beginning of July. I would like to know, since 
Cuba has been invited to join, what the range of possibilities 
that this represents, will mean for Cuba? 
  [Castro] I think it is an important step forward, and 
somehow, the Barbados meeting was part of the efforts aimed 
toward the creation of this association and Cuba's 
participation. As you know, the Yankees strongly oppose Cuba's 
participation in any of these types of associations. We have to 
wait to see how events develop, whether the pressures can be 
overcome, and if Cuba gets to belong to this association. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, do you believe that in Latin 
America, as well as in Ibero-America, there is currently a true 
commitment to integration? And in this case: What roles would 
Spain and Portugal play? Secondly, I would like to ask your 
opinion on the final document and its frequently-referred to 
content of neoliberalism and its praise for the Uruguay rounds 
and GATT. 
  [Castro] A true, full commitment is still lacking. We could 
say there is progress, which we could call significant, toward 
developing that awareness. That awareness still has to develop 
and to this end, the summits help. Spain and Portugal might play 
a role in one way or another. They have advocated certain 
interesting initiatives and have served as a bridge between 
Latin America and Europe. As the threat of a war of large 
economic blocs looms, the presence of Spain and Portugal is an 
advantage, not in regard to integration because Spain and 
Portugal cannot integrate into a joint Latin America, but they 
can contribute to this integration. They can and are, as a 
matter of fact, doing so. This is the way the summits were 
conceived. On occasion, we have an opportunity to see the 
advantage of their presence. 
  Was there a third question? 
  [Correspondent] Yes. The second question was about.... 
  [Castro, interrupting] Well, I already answered the second 
question about the role of Portugal. What was the other one? 
  [Correspondent] It was about your opinion on the final 
document of the summit. 
  [Castro] One is never satisfied with the final documents of 
these meetings. These are documents that have to be discussed 
and negotiated extensively, keeping an eye on every comma and 
word. The burden of neoliberalism is present in the reality of 
Latin America. It is very strong and pervasive. Some have not 
sympathized much with neoliberalism and certain personalities 
and countries are beginning to show a not-so-blind faith in 
neoliberalism. Some have turned it into a religion and others 
are beginning to discover the other face of that religion. For 
example, there is the case of Venezuela, which has huge problems 
despite its wealth. They no longer speak in terms of 
neoliberalism. There are other countries that do not express the 
same enthusiasm. I do not want to mention them, so they cannot 
be singled out. There is still, however, a strong neoliberal 
following. 
  It would take awhile to explain. Many things have been 
privatized, and much revenue as been accrued. It does not last, 
however. There have been certain advantages, given the low 
interest rates that have prevailed for a number of years. If the 
interest rates, however, were to reach the 1985 level, when we 
waged the fight against the foreign debt, a $487 billion debt 
would be a catastrophe. There is much euphoria. Many are 
euphoric following the implementation measures that have reduced 
inflation and fiscal deficits and such, but at the cost of a 
general shearing in terms of the budgets for social programs. 
  They are now beginning to realize that they might be digging 
an abyss. Neoliberalism, the way it was advancing, was digging 
an abyss. This is why, even the International Monetary Fund, the 
World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank, are now 
speaking of social costs. No one knows, however, from where or 
when these monies will appear. What is true is that 
circumstances have worsened and despite certain favorable 
macroeconomic indexes, the per-capita income of Latin America -- 
not under a blockade, not under the harsh double blockade that 
Cuba is experiencing, and not undergoing a special period -- is 
the same as 16 years ago. The levels of education and health, in 
general, are experiencing heavy setbacks, to the point that they 
have realized this could result in far-reaching social 
explosions. They greatly fear social explosions and are 
beginning to talk about formulas to tackle what they call social 
development; even the Yankees are becoming aware of this. 
Neoliberalism is still strong. The neoliberal euphoria will last 
for some time. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, your arrival at the summit made 
us 
remember Raul Ferrer's line: The Fatherland is a Mambi dressed 
in guayabera. How did wearing a guayabera, after 37 years, make 
you feel? 
  [Castro] I feel as good in a gala uniform as in an olive 
green uniform, pajamas, shorts, or a guayabera. What happened, 
as I explained today to our friends, is that we were all asked 
to make an effort to show up in short sleeves and guayaberas 
because of the heat. To tell you the truth, I did not have a 
single guayabera. I had to borrow some and try them on to see if 
they would fit, but none did. They made some guayaberas for me 
in a few hours. 
  First, they had to find the fabric. We did not have any 
fabric. They were trying to make a green guayabera, but we could 
not find the fabric anywhere. They tried a strong blue hue, but 
the only fabric that the people who do this for the Council of 
State and institutions, that outfit people when they have to 
fulfill a function, had available was this clear color. They are 
good at this. They made a great effort, did not sleep. It was 
chaos. I was scheduled to depart on Monday night, and by 
midmorning, they tried a guayabera on me that they had finished 
at who knows what hour. They were concerned about the length of 
the sleeves, the fit of the shoulders, and whether it needed to 
be a quarter-inch longer. The first one they made was like a 
dressing gown. I fit in it twice. I said: I am really not this 
fat. [laughter] They did not have my measurements or anything. 
They fixed it. I am pleased. They came out quite well. They were 
even concerned about what type of collar was in fashion. One of 
the ones I borrowed was from (Chon) and had a longer collar. 
[laughter] I am taller than (Chon) and it did not fit right. 
Then, they said that the modern style was shorter. What do I 
know about fashion? I do not want to be bothered by this. 
Luckily, I did not have to have a suit made. I told them to find 
a compromise. What I did was wear the white guayabera over the 
cream shirt of my uniform. They had time to make at least four 
pairs of pants. [laughter] 
  [Correspondent] It was a hit. 
  [Castro] This guayabera made history. Many praised it. Some 
people were against it. A little girl asked me why I changed to 
it, and I told her: No, I am still wearing my uniform, but 
inside me. The boots were the same ones I use everyday. They are 
really a bit old, but I am used to them. I wore the same boots 
and the same uniform pants. 
  [Correspondent] Some said you were half civilian, half 
military. 
  [Castro] Yesterday, I changed further so no one could say I 
was wearing a uniform -- the same guayabera and pants, but I 
wore navy blue and a darker blue guayabera, but the same boots. 
I have only taken off my boots to sleep. I think this was the 
right thing to do. Some have made all kinds of assumptions 
because I was not wearing a uniform. I did it in response to my 
host's request. I did not want to be the discordant note and 
different from the rest. 
  [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] in guayabera or uniform? 
  [Castro] I still do not know. I still have things to do. 
Perhaps my conscience will begin to bother me and I will put my 
olive green uniform back on again. I could return in a 
guayabera, but tomorrow I will not wear a guayabera. I cannot 
say the final word, however. [laughter] I do not want to say 
that I am never going to wear it. What do I know. Perhaps, there 
is a reception I will have to wear it to. They are truly 
comfortable and cool. Perhaps I will borrow one of Robertico's 
[Robaina] uniforms. [laughter] 
  I have been comfortable. It is truly hot here. I think I am 
going back to my old olive green uniform, however. It is an old 
custom. That was the history of the guayabera; it was an 
odyssey. I did not have anything to wear to comply with my hosts 
except my pajamas. [laughter] My pajamas were the only outfit 
that met their requirements. We solved the problem, however. But 
I do not have a single suit. If one of these times they forced 
me to wear a suit, I assure you, I am going to have to borrow 
one. 
  [Correspondent] Commander, whether wearing a guayabera or an 
olive green uniform, what are Cuba's dreams for the fifth summit? 
  [Castro] We have spoken of dreams so often. My guayabera and 
my uniform, hwoever, are the Latin American of which Bolivar and 
Marti dreamt. As I said today to our friends, we are not worthy 
of speaking about Marti and Bolivar until we attain a united, 
politically and economically, integrated Latin America. This is 
my dream, and I believe, the dream of every progressive and 
revolutionary man of Latin America. I can also speak of a dream 
for a progressive and socialist Latin America. Yet, that is 
looking far into the distance. If you said such a thing in a 
summit, well, you can imagine. [laughter] Quite a brouhaha.

<F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Lopez Ordaz] </F>
  [Text] Tapachula, Chiapas, 21 Jun -- In an open letter, the 
Mexican Southeastern Revolutionary Peasants and Workers Front 
(Frecoms), which is an armed group that allegedly operates in 
the region and which has threatened to stage an uprising similar 
to that of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN], 
requested a meeting with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno 
"to find peaceful solutions and to participate in the Chiapas 
peace talks." 
  The Frecoms appeared for the first time on 31 March, as the 
local EL ORBE newspaper published a report on a meeting between 
the newspaper and Subcommander Pedro, a meeting during which he 
announced the emergence of this armed group, which is willing to 
take up arms, as the EZLN did, should the government "fail to 
meet people's demands." During the meeting, Subcommander Pedro 
pointed out his organization is not connected with the EZLN and 
other groups that operate in the Central American isthmus. 
  According to the report published by EL ORBE, the Frecoms 
has 
active members in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, and Oaxaca States. 
Subcommander Pedro also said his organization wants a change 
toward democracy. 
  Today in EL ORBE, this alleged armed group published an open 
letter requesting a meeting with Governor Lopez to participate 
in the peace negotiations. Archbishop Arizmendi Esquivel 
reported that, according to information provided by the 42 
priests who make up this dioceses and who visit the communities 
of La Costa, Soconusco, Frontera, and Sierra, "this armed group 
does not exist." 
  He added that the priests are in constant contact with the 
residents of this region as well as with the catechists, and "no 
movements by armed people or groups that are part of a front 
similar to the EZLN have been detected, unless it is so secret, 
no one knows about it so far." 
  The Tapachula bishop, however, did not rule out that some 
people are trying to manipulate the population, trying to stage 
an uprising to meet personal demands, or that someone simply 
wants to make "more noise." This is why he urged the population 
not to be concerned by broadcast information that goes beyond 
what prudence dictates and why he asked the media to be careful 
in the handling of this type of news, which could trigger 
uncertainty among the population. 
  The priest underscored that fighting for the rights of 
individuals and groups is beneficial, but he asked people not to 
take up arms and make threats, which leads only to violence and 
confrontation.

  [Text] Managua, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Former Sandinist soldiers, 
apparently disarmed, today occupied the cathedral in Esteli, 150 
km north of Managua to demand attention from the government, a 
local radio station has reported. 
  "There are 10 people, who do not seem to be carrying any 
weapons. They are wearing civilian clothes, and their faces are 
not covered," Javier Borges, a member of the parish, told AFP by 
telephone. 
  Worshipers who were inside the cathedral praying "ran out" 
when the former soldiers entered the church, Borges said. He 
added that together with Julio Cesar Videa, the archbishop of 
Esteli, he tried to persuade the intruders to leave the 
cathedral. 
  The occupiers identified themselves as members of the 
National Self-Defense Movement (MADNA), which consists of former 
members of the Army and the Government Ministry who were 
dismissed by the government without being given indemnification. 
  Meanwhile, police arrested at least 11 men who blocked an 
access road to Esteli for several minutes at the time the 
occupation was taking place, according to radio reports not 
officially confirmed. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, MADNA is demanding from 
the 
government an indemnification of $2,000 for each demobilized 
soldier. Authorities, however, have refused to give them that 
amount.

  [Text] The government and URNG [Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity] delegations meeting in Olso to discuss 
issues related to the creation of a Truth Commission or 
mechanisms to clear up the past, agreed to extend negotiations 
for four more days, as suggested by the Norwegian Government, to 
reach an agreement to prevent the peace process from falling 
apart. 
  Guerrilla Commander Rolando Moran said there are still 
several issues to be discussed with the government's peace 
commission, which is the reason both sides agreed to remain in 
Oslo where this new round of negotiations began last Monday. 
  He added that there is openness with respect to an 
issue that has been under discussion since last year, but it is 
very difficult and problematic. The main challenge is to reach 
the end of the process with a political solution to the armed 
conflict that will not exclude an investigation into war crimes, 
because these crimes are part of the country's reality. 
  Meanwhile, Hector Rosada, president of the government's 
Peace 
Commission (COPAZ), commented that there has been 
substantial progress, leading us to believe that there will be 
an agreement. He also stressed that the government does not 
fear confronting the truth. It is necessary for us to confront 
the past in order to brave the future. However, the greatest 
problem lies in doing what is right and that whatever is agreed 
upon has a political reality in the short run. 
  Even though the negotiations are currently in the most 
difficult stage, Jan Egeland, secretary of state of the 
Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry who is participating in the 
negotiations, believes that if they do not continue 
discussing the issue, the entire peace process will be jeopardy. 
It is for this reason that Norway has the moral obligation to 
ensure that all possible instruments leading to an agreement may 
be at the disposal of all parties, because these are practical 
and significant problems. 
  In addition, it was learned that there is a rough draft of a 
document presented by the UN regarding the makeup of the 
investigative commission. In addition, there is another 
recommendation presented by the Guatemalan civilian sector that 
includes Argentine Nobel Peace laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel. 
This proposal was rejected by the government delegation because 
they believe Perez Esquivel is too politicized. 
  Before the beginning of the talks, which were originally 
scheduled to conclude yesterday, the host country was too 
optimistic. Despite the fact that there is still no agreement 
with respect to the Truth Commission, they underscored progress 
made in the negotiations by pointing out the agreement signed on 
Friday concerning the relocation of people uprooted as result of 
the armed conflict.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Jun (AE) -- President Itamar Franco 
today signed a decree ordering the implementation within 
Brazilian territory of UN Security Council Resolution 917, dated 
6 May, which imposes an embargo on Haiti in light of the coup 
that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Through the 
decree the Brazilian Government suspends every form of trade 
with Haiti, restricts the landing or entry into Brazilian 
airspace of any aircraft going to or coming from Haiti, and 
freezes all assets deposited in Brazil.

  [Text] Santiago, 21 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Government 
reaffirmed today that the territories of Easter Island, a 
Chilean possession of 160 square km located 3,600 km west of the 
continent, whose inhabitants have been on indefinite strike 
since 20 June, belong to the state. 
  The islanders, who make up a population of 2,800 people, 
sued 
the Chilean Government for the return of their land, which was 
declared state property in 1933. They also want the electoral 
law reformed to give them a deputy and a senator to represent 
them in Congress. 
  The National Resources Ministry said today that "according 
to 
our legislation, and this has been recognized, the State of 
Chile owns the territories that make up Easter Island." 
  Interior Minister German Correa said in Santiago that not 
everyone in that community was on strike. He announced that an 
official of the Regional Development Undersecretariat will 
travel to the island in the next few days to examine the on-site 
situation and report to officials. 
  About 18 months ago a group of islanders took over the 
airfield at Mataveri Airport for several days, demanding more 
flights of Lan-Chile, which is the only airline that flies to 
the island, and protesting an airfare hike. This situation was 
resolved with the mediation of Interior Ministry Under Secretary 
Belisario Velasco. 
  Easter Island, which lives from tourism thanks to the 867 
"moais" or giant statues spread over its territory, became 
famous last year during the filming of the picture "Rapa Nui" by 
U.S. actor Kevin Costner, who came to the island to direct the 
film, in which 300 islanders worked as extras.

  [Text] This morning, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy 
requested that comments and criticism with respect to the Armed 
Forces be made with some kind of foundation and that those 
making these criticisms "at least have completed the fourth 
grade." 
  In an open criticism of the education of legislators 
studying 
the draft bill on the National Defense Organic Law, the 
president said: "I think people with experience should comment 
on these kinds of issues, particularly military issues. But it 
is precisely those who have not completed the fourth grade or 
done their military service who want to comment." 
  The head of state made these comments when asked about the 
position of legislators who support the idea of having an equal 
number of military and civilian representatives in the National 
Defense Council. The occasion was the celebration of the "Day 
of Military Justice" at the Diserjumil [Military Justice Service 
Directorate] premises in Itaugua. 
  Rear Admiral Carlos Lopez Moreira agreed with Wasmosy, and 
pointed out that the executive bill essentially seeks "to avoid 
excessive bureaucracy." Lopez Moreira said the idea is to avoid 
having a gigantic National Defense Council that would be 
difficult to assemble. The admiral added that officers are not 
opposed to including "civilians" on the council, as some 
legislators want to make people believe. 
  Chamber of Deputies Defense Committee members, who were 
scheduled to discuss the retirement of Armed Forces officers who 
want to run for president or other important positions, decided 
to postpone the discussion of the issue until 29 June, due to 
the absence today of the military representatives. 
  According to a note remitted to Defense Committee President 
Sergio Lopez, the military representatives justified their 
absence "due to service reasons."

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Gulliver Tied Down By Moral Strings"] </F>
  [Text] Delegates to the annual OAS meeting in Brazil 
expressed their opposition to an armed intervention in Haiti to 
restore Jean Bertrand Aristide's democratic government. The 
small English-speaking Caribbean countries expressed support for 
military action against the Haitian military coupists. Nothing 
suggests, however, that they did so because of U.S. pressure 
when even the Clinton administration seems unenthusiastic about 
supporting such military action. 
  It seems that good sense has finally prevailed. Democracy is 
not imposed through armed invasions. This is, however, 
frequently overlooked in politics on the basis of the strong 
moral justifications which have dominated Washington and North 
America for many years. Although Republican administrations were 
responsible for the military operations against Grenada and 
Panama, the democrats' "moral" reasons are also very strong. The 
truth is that its experience in Somalia, which is considered a 
failure, has embarrassed the United States. In view of this, it 
has reviewed, once again, its moral role in the world. 
  Some time ago, Clinton explained that the United States 
cannot resolve world problems. Perhaps this means it will not 
even try in the future. This means the bloodbaths in Rwanda and 
South Yemen will continue indefinitely, enabling the U.S. 
Administration to maintain peace of mind. It tried, it failed, 
what else can be done. All this is fine if it entails an end to 
military invasions justified through legal resolutions. It is 
bad, however, if it means the United States -- paralyzed by 
moral contradictions -- will conduct its international affairs 
in a disorderly fashion. 
  The Clinton administration has been fiercely criticized for 
renewing China's most-favored-nation status, overlooking human 
rights violations. What is condemnable, however, is not the fact 
that it has made an exception with China, but that it has not 
done so in other instances. While the reasons may differ, there 
is no need to insist that exceptions apply only in terms of 
trade. 
  There is no sense to military intervention of Haiti. Not 
just 
because the OAS, with good sense, rejects the imposition of 
democracy through military force, but because U.S. intervention 
in international affairs depends on the nature of the issues in 
question. Undoubtedly, every human life is precious, but human 
rights violations in China are not the same as the massacre of 
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans or Somalis. Furthermore, it is 
not absolutely clear that the military action in Somalia was 
wrong. The international community, through the United Nations, 
made a courageous decision to stop the massacre of innocent 
people. This is not the same as imposing commercial or military 
sanctions on a country to restore democracy. 
  The international community needs a leader who can decide 
where to act and where not to act. If the Clinton administration 
does not overcome its moral paralysis, it will be tied down like 
Gulliver by the Lilliputians.

  [Text] Moron, Venezuela, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Riots, during 
which two grocery stores were looted, rocked Moron and Puerto 
Cabello today. Meanwhile, student protests were staged in 
Caracas. 
  The disturbances took place in Moron after a march was 
called 
to protest the high cost of living, but the situation is already 
under control, according to statements to the media by Governor 
Henrique Salas. Similar protests were staged in nearby Puerto 
Cabello. 
  Valencia--the country's third largest city located 100 km 
west of Caracas--was left without bus service because of a 
strike. Drivers are demanding higher bus fares, according to the 
governor. 
  Around noon, protests were staged near the Central 
University 
of Venezuela in Caracas, and local journalists reported that 
police had arrived on the scene.

  [Text] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada used the 
expression "one can drink milk without owning a cow" in his 
proposal for an outlet to the Pacific Ocean without the need for 
Bolivia to recover ownership of the territory it lost to Chile. 
Opposition congressmen yesterday reported that Foreign Minister 
Antonio Aranibar will be summoned to Congress to explain, in a 
secret session, the content and scope of the president's 
proposal. 
  Sanchez de Lozada's proposal in Colombia has prompted 
different reactions within the Bolivian opposition; while some 
congressmen said he is giving up a century old national desire 
for a "sovereign outlet to the sea," others called the proposal 
an "interesting initiative." 
  The most adamant opponents of that proposal are Nationalist 
Democratic Action leader Jorge Landivar and Democratic Socialism 
Alternative Deputy Jerjes Justiniano. 
  Landivar said Sanchez de Lozada has been hasty in his 
attempt 
to solve the maritime issue, adding that the president's 
proposal is some sort of a "tenancy agreement" because although 
Bolivia will have an outlet to the sea, it will be through a 
foreign territory. 
  Justiniano said that we cannot give up a sovereign corridor 
to the sea because this is the right of all Bolivians and 
because it implies "treason to the fatherland."

  [Text] Ottawa -- The signing of a nuclear cooperation 
agreement between Argentina and Canada has already got the first 
joint project off the ground. The two countries will begin 
studies for the construction of an energy-producing plant to 
supply a city of 3 million residents. 
  The agreement is one of the key factors in President Carlos 
Menem's trip, and it includes the possible construction of a 
400-megawatt Candu-type unit, which is larger than that of 
Atucha. 
  The studies could be concluded by year's end, and the unit 
will be installed in the neighborhood of the Embalse Nuclear 
Center, in Cordoba Province, if an agreement is reached. The 
Canadians have guaranteed that they are in a position to build 
it in 42 months. There also will be innovations such as the use 
of partially enriched uranium to reduce contamination and 
increase the fuel's yield.

  [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Government has accepted 
the Argentine Foreign Ministry's apologies, which alleged that 
President Carlos Menem had not been informed about the candidacy 
of Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he endorsed the 
candidacy of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for 
chairman of the World Trade Organization, which will replace 
GATT. Menem announced his support for Salinas at the Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia. 
  In a letter received by Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso 
Amorim this past weekend, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di 
Tella states that his government is willing to review its 
support for the Mexican candidate. 
  The two foreign ministries are interested in minimizing the 
diplomatic incident to avoid further consequences. This past 
weekend, President Menem sent his condolences to President 
Franco for the death of his nephew and private secretary Ariosto 
during the Cartagena summit. 
  According to Itamaraty sources, President Itamar Franco's 
premature return to Brazil because of the death of his nephew, 
and the disclosure immediately afterward by President Menem of 
his support for the candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, 
created such a big problem in the bilateral relations between 
the two countries that Foreign Minister Celso Amorim allegedly 
discussed with President Franco the possibility of recalling 
Brazilian Ambassador to Buenos Aires Marcos Azambuja "for 
consultations." In diplomatic language, this means a temporary 
suspension of relations between the two countries. 
  The Brazilian Government has decided to accept the 
explanation that it was all a misunderstanding after Di Tella 
summoned Azambuja on 17 June to tell him, among other things, 
the following: 

  -  President Menem was not informed (by the 
Argentine foreign minister) that Rubens Ricupero's candidacy for 
WTO chairman was of great interest to Brazil; 
  -  The Argentine 
delegation in Cartagena thought that President Franco had 
discussed the issue with the Mexican president. As the 
Brazilian delegation left the summit soon after the death of 
Ariosto Franco, without leaving any recommendation, President 
Menem accepted the pressure from Mexico and decided to publicly 
express support for Salinas. 

  According to Itamaraty sources, the Argentine Government 
wants to use the opportunity of the Mercosur [Common Market of 
the South] summit that will probably take place on 15 July in 
Buenos Aires "to put a definite end" to this "misunderstanding." 
  Meanwhile, Brazil expects Argentina to inform the 
governments 
of Colombia (which hosted the Ibero-American summit) and of 
Mexico that Argentina had not intended to "reject" [desapoiar] 
the candidacy of Ricupero as WTO chairman.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Good Friend"] </F>
  [Text] Brazil would have acted properly if, in fact, it 
would have canceled the visit of Argentine Economy Minister 
Domingo Cavallo to Brazil in retaliation for President Carlos 
Menem's objectionable action to launch the candidacy of Mexican 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for chairman of the World 
Trade Organization [WTO] against that of Brazilian Finance 
Minister Rubens Ricupero, which already had been announced. 
  What Menem did in Cartagena, Colombia, was an act of 
provocation. He waited for the last moment of the Ibero-American 
Summit to create a disagreeable diplomatic situation in keeping 
with a political line that has become commonplace at all the 
international forums he attends -- and Menem attends all the 
forums he can. Menem, who is an exhibitionist, implements 
demagogic actions in foreign policy aimed at domestic campaigns 
in which he relies on voters' short memories to make them 
promises he will hardly be able to comply with later. 
  Since the Persian Gulf War, when Argentina sent a small 
squadron to the theater of operations that did not do anything, 
through the controversial approval of NAFTA, Menem attempted to 
please the White House at any cost. He will make any deal for an 
interview with the U.S. President. On this occasion, Menem has 
visibly offered the United States to simultaneously bomb two 
candidacies for the WTO presidency: Ricupero, who represents the 
developing countries, and Renato Ruggero, the former Italian 
economy minister who represents the EC. Within this context, 
Salinas seems a docile candidate for the White House, which is 
willing to play the role of an interested friend. 
  Menem's unexpected support for Salinas is a serious matter 
because 10 days earlier, Itamaraty had informed the Argentine 
and Mexican Governments that Ricupero would be a candidate for 
WTO chairman. In diplomatic language, Argentina and Mexico "got 
the message" of Brazil's intention. 
  Within the context of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] 
and relations among Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, 
which have been engaged in economic commitments since the 
beginning of the year, it was more than obvious that naming 
Ricupero should be an essential maneuver. 
  During the last OAS meeting in Belem, when most of the 
countries that attended the meeting, including Brazil, spoke in 
favor of Cuba joining the organization, Menem went against the 
tide and automatically sided with the United States. He could 
not miss that chance. In an extravagant manner, he stands out 
from the other leaders of this part of the world. He is an apple 
polisher. Not even the United States is as resentful. Evidence 
of this is its economic closeness to Vietnam (where in the 
sixties it lost 50,000 men), Russia, and the PRC. 
  To ignore Ricupero's candidacy and jump into the arms of 
Salinas is to openly support a policy that is ostensibly failing 
in Mexico. The Mexican electoral campaign has demonstrated that 
its political system is in crisis after one party's supremacy 
over the rest for 70 years. The alliance between Mexico and the 
United States through NAFTA is a desperate move to save a 
pretend democracy that clashes with the U.S. market economy 
system, political freedom, and free elections without fraud or 
violence. 
  To support the Mexican regime at this point is the same as 
expressing distrust of the Mercosur partners. Menem has bet on 
an uncertain future. His words were like a green light to the 
Argentine business people who protest the invasion of Brazilian 
products and prefer to seek protection in a protectionist 
government instead of improving their competitiveness. This idea 
has prompted the formation of economic blocs like those in 
Europe and Asia, including the American continent, to overcome 
any obstacles to the world economy's growth. 
  Since 1 January, Mercosur member countries have reduced 
their 
import tariffs 85 percent. On 30 June, they must reduce them 89 
percent, and by the end of the year they must eliminate them 
completely. Mercosur is a reality that cannot be ignored. Chile, 
which first considered joining NAFTA, now is turning to 
Mercosur. Menem, by offering to serve the United States, is 
turning his back on his closest friends and undermining 
continental solidarity.

  [Text] Sao Paulo -- PT [Workers Party] presidential 
candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva yesterday regretted that 
many Brazilian businessmen had not evolved since the 1989 
elections. "They would rather have a thief in the presidency 
than an honest individual," said Lula, before departing on a 
six-day visit to the Republic of South Africa and to Germany. 
Lula believes that the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries 
(FIESP) represents the most backward of Brazilian businessmen, 
especially if one is to believe "the foolish things said by 
former FIESP President Mario Amato in 1989." On that occasion, 
Amato said that if Lula had won the elections, 800,000 
businessmen would leave Brazil. 
  Lula said he does not expect to receive support from the 
"FIESP people," and that he will not make any effort to convince 
the businessmen to vote for him, as he considers FIESP a 
backward organization. "It is a fiefdom that works in an 
outdated manner," Lula said. He recalled that when he was a 
labor union leader he refused to negotiate with the FIESP. "It 
is the most backward institution. Good businessmen do their 
negotiations apart," he said. 
  The PT candidate said he is sorry for these businessmen who 
have never evolved, while the rest of society is giving 
unmistakable signals of doing so. "Those businesses think only 
of themselves, and never think of a society of 155 million 
inhabitants," he said. "I will win the elections, and they will 
realize how bad it was for Brazil that I did not win the 1989 
elections," Lula added. The PT campaign strategy will not 
change over the criticisms made by businessmen. "In 1989, I did 
not have businessmen's committees supporting me. Nowadays I 
have them in several states, which means that on this particular 
point there has been some progress," he said, after which he 
recalled that since the beginning of the campaign he had already 
participated in more than 80 meetings with businessmen from all 
sectors. 
  Lula criticized Democratic Labor Party candidate Leonel 
Brizola when he said that the former governor could relate only 
with the workers of the fifties. Brizola considered Lula's 
declaration of assets before the Superior Electoral Court 
strange. "Brizola comes from a time when workers ate from a 
wooden plate, wore old slippers, and were poorly dressed, which 
were the times of populism," Lula said.

  [Excerpt] Barreiras -- On 19 June, PDT [Democratic Labor 
Party] candidate Leonel Brizola warned that politicians' moral 
standards, weakened by electoral bonds worth billions of 
cruzeiros, can ripen conditions for the military's return to 
power. He added: "The people's rejection of and scorn for 
politicians will turn into hate." 
  Brizola said he was "shocked" at the parties' estimated 
expenses. "This will cause uneasiness in the barracks because it 
amounts to squandering public funds," he said. He criticized the 
bill providing for income tax discounts covering part of the 
donations. He admitted that the deputies of his own party are 
reluctant to approve the bill. Brizola advocated Superior 
Electoral Court (TSE) action to strictly limit candidates' 
expenses. 
  According to Brizola, if the TSE president does not take 
action, "Brazilian democracy will deteriorate to the benefit of 
those in the military who nurture moralistic and power 
ambitions." He said a modest budget allocation for parties would 
be better than the current law. He suggested that the TSE allow 
each candidate to use only two small jet planes and ban 
electoral shows, "which are too expensive." If no action is 
taken, "what Fernando Collor did will be very small compared 
with what will be done during these elections," Brizola said.

<F P=106> [Article by Brasilia correspondent Francisco Goncalves] </F>
  [Text] Encouraged by the ratification in Congress of the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, which proscribes nuclear weapons in Latin 
America and the Caribbean, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry has 
decided to intensify the Brazilian Government's participation 
within international organizations to fight the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons. Itamaraty's priority is to expedite the Geneva 
talks aimed at achieving a complete ban on nuclear tests. 
  Itamaraty has instructed the Brazilian negotiators to take 
steps to ensure that the treaty addresses the ban on two fronts: 
on the one hand, to prohibit countries that still do not have 
nuclear weapons from making tests with a view to mastering the 
technology; and on the other, to prohibit countries that have 
already mastered the technology from making tests to develop new 
generations of nuclear weapons. 
  Heading the group of 21 developing countries at the Geneva 
talks, the Brazilian Government believes the treaty on the ban 
of nuclear tests will be concluded early in 1995. Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim said: "We hope the stumbling blocks 
standing in the way of the agreement will be rapidly removed so 
we may all contribute to having mankind eliminate the nuclear 
threat." Countries like Great Britain, France, and China have 
objected to the ban on nuclear tests at the Geneva talks.

in Angra dos Reis, who claims to have detected signs of 
contamination in children residing in the Angra dos Reis 
municipal district and in employees of the Angra-1 nuclear plant. 
  The biology professor has noted the emergence of cysts; 
ovarian, breast, and uterine cancer; and even reduction in 
chromosomes in some children. 
  Deputy de Miguel has asked the attorney general to shut down 
the nuclear plant until the true cause of these health disorders 
is determined.

  [Text] Yesterday, the Souza Cruz Company confirmed that it 
had made two shipments of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco to the 
United States. This type of tobacco has twice as much nicotine 
as regular tobacco (6 percent as compared to the average 3 
percent). Production of the Y-1 tobacco has been banned in the 
United States. Y-1 was developed in a laboratory by the U.S. 
company DNA Plant Technology. The U.S. Department of 
Agriculture has banned both the production and export of seeds 
of this type of tobacco. 
  David Kessler, director of the FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration), reported that the Y-1 plant was grown in Brazil 
because "U.S. manufacturers agreed that the nicotine content of 
new varieties of tobacco should be close to average levels," 
which vary from 2.5 to 3.5 percent. According to Souza Cruz, 
Y-1 was produced at the request of the Brown and Williamson 
Tobacco Co. The company's press office in Rio de Janeiro 
reported that 850 tonnes were exported in 1991, and 253 tonnes 
in 1992. 
  Souza Cruz adviser Victor Sznejder said the company filled 
orders placed by Brown and Williamson as well as by 50 other 
customers from different locations around the world. Yet of the 
average 60,000 tonnes of tobacco of various species exported by 
Souza Cruz, the only order for the Y-1 type came from Brown and 
Williamson. Although denying that the plant had undergone 
genetic changes, Souza Cruz could not explain how the seeds of 
the Y-1 plant -- the patent rights for which Brown and 
Williamson has claimed both in Brazil and the United States -- 
ended up in the hands of Brazilian farmers. 
  Souza Cruz does not produce tobacco in Brazil, but purchases 
the production of 65,000 farmers in southern Brazil. These 
farmers, however, could not have gained access on their own to 
the genetic code of the Y-1 plant. Brown and Williamson may 
have sent the seeds to Souza Cruz, which in turn may have turned 
them over to the farmers. The two companies are close partners. 
They are both controlled by BAT (British American Tobacco) 
Industries, a British group that owns 100 percent of the assets 
of Brown and Williamson and 75 percent of those of Souza Cruz. 
  In Brasilia, the Brazilian Government has announced that it 
has no control over the nicotine content of cigarettes 
manufactured in Brazil. Yesterday, the Agriculture Ministry, 
which is charged with monitoring tobacco production, reported it 
has never heard of the Y-1 high nicotine tobacco. The FDA 
claimed that this type of tobacco, which has a high content of 
nicotine and which increases addiction in smokers, is being 
produced in Brazil. 
  Jose Meireles, chief of the Division of Production 
Standardization and Supervision, said their control of Brazilian 
tobacco is limited to "checking the health conditions of the 
product." Government experts would verify, for instance, 
excessive humidity or use of toxic pesticides. They do their 
inspection with the naked eye, without laboratory analyses that 
could measure the nicotine content. 
  Thus, Brazilian consumers do not have the slightest idea of 
the tar or nicotine content of the tobacco used to manufacture 
cigarettes in the country. In most cases, the experts rely on 
the information supplied by the respective manufacturers. 
  Advisers of Agriculture Minister Sinval Guazelli have noted 
that the ministry has no authority to check the quality of 
export products. In the case of the Y-1 tobacco exported to the 
United States, Law 5025 -- issued in 1966 -- provides that an 
exporter will be held accountable for the quality of the product 
he is selling. Agricultural experts are awaiting, however, to 
receive the FDA report to discuss with Industry and Commerce 
Ministry the mechanisms for controlling the tobacco being 
exported. 
  The Health Ministry has announced that it has no authority 
to 
monitor the content of cigarettes. The ministry has issued only 
one decree on the subject; it orders manufacturers to post the 
warning that cigarette smoking is hazardous to human health on 
each cigarette.

  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 21 Jun -- On 20 June, Colombian 
President-elect Ernesto Samper and Vice President-elect Humberto 
de la Calle held their first news conference for the foreign 
press, including MAINICHI SHINBUN. Touching on economic 
relations, the president-elect said: "Colombia will give top 
priority to our relations with Japan, and we want Japan to know 
more about our country." 
  Concerning the current lack of interest among Japanese 
companies toward investing in Colombia due to apprehensions over 
security problems such as terrorism and abduction, both of them 
pointed out: "Other foreign investors share the same anxieties. 
Since measures have been taken to ensure security, however, 
such activities are no obstacle to investment." They also said: 
"We hope the Japanese people will try to learn more about 
Colombia. We are sure that measures can be taken to solve the 
security problem."

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Cuban Vice President Carlos 
Lage has commented that Canada's resumption of official economic 
aid to Cuba shows Canada's willingness to ensure continuity in 
bilateral talks. He added: "This pleases us, and we will work 
toward that goal." 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage noted: "This is an 
important step in terms of Canadian policy toward Cuba 
throughout the years." "It is in line," he added, "with an 
increase in existing economic and commercial ties, particularly 
in the area of tourism." 
  In discussing the visit by Christine Stewart, minister of 
state for Latin America and Africa, the Cuban vice president 
said the visit intensifies relations between the two countries, 
which are, in fact, already satisfactory. "This relationship is 
very important for Cuba," he concluded. 
  On Monday night, President Fidel Castro received Stewart, 
the 
highest-ranking Canadian official to visit the island in more 
than 18 years since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's visit 
to Havana in 1976. Stewart described the meeting as fruitful. 
  Stewart also met with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; 
National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; Finance and Prices 
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez; and Ernesto Melendez, minister of 
foreign investment and economic cooperation. 
  Together with Lage, last night, the Canadian minister opened 
an international businessmen's conference on business 
opportunities in Cuba sponsored by THE ECONOMIST magazine. More 
than 120 executives from firms in Canada, the UK, the United 
States, Europe, and Latin America are participating in the event. 
  On Monday, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet in Ottawa and 
Stewart in Havana simultaneously issued official announcements 
ending the suspension of Canada's official economic aid to Cuba. 
The aid has been suspended in 1978 in the wake of the Cuban 
military aid to Angola in the face of the South African 
aggression. 
  Eduardo del Buey, a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman who 
is accompanying Stewart, stressed: "This is an important moment 
in the ties between Cuba and Canada" based on "frequent and 
honest dialogues." 
  "It is a dialogue between friends who disagree on certain 
things, but who feel mutual respect. It is a dialogue that 
serves to consolidate the basis of their relations," Del Buey 
told PRENSA LATINA. 
  In this regard, Bienvenido Garcia, a department director at 
the Cuban Foreign Ministry, explained: "There are more points of 
agreement than disagreement." 
  At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart 
said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not 
only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also 
because Canada will benefit. 
  Canada has large foreign investments in the mining sector, 
not only in the traditional nickel sector, but also in 
prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as exploring for 
oil. 
  In addition, Canada sends more tourists to Cuba than any 
other nation. More than 120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations 
in Cuba every year. 
  Stewart also expressed Ottawa's desire for Cuba to return to 
the OAS, where "it can again play an important role with all of 
its privileges and responsibilities." 
  On this subject, she noted that "isolation is unhealthy," 
and 
she said her government plans to review with other nations the 
possibility of Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization. 
Cuba was suspended from the OAS in 1962 as a result of U.S. 
pressures. "This is not something we can accomplish overnight, 
however; we believe it is a process we must begin to think 
about," she added. 
  She said Canada understands the current difficulties in Cuba 
and praised the government's efforts to try to maintain the 
benefits of important social programs in areas such as education 
and health. On this point, she stressed: "It is difficult, but 
vital, to continue these efforts." 
  With regard to the Canadian Government's willingness to 
heighten the political dialogue, Stewart mentioned the interest 
expressed by Foreign Minister Ouellet to meet with Cuban Foreign 
Minister Robaina at "some appropriate moment."

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today, Christine Stewart, 
Canada's minister of state for Latin America and Africa, stated 
her country's opposition to the policy of isolation of Cuba. 
Stewart discussed the development of bilateral ties with the 
local government. 
  At a time the island is trying to resolve its problems amid 
serious difficulties, "it needs friends and support so the 
changes can be implemented in a positive and peaceful manner," 
the official said in a news conference before returning to her 
country. 
  Stewart explained that Canada has that bilateral 
responsibility, adding it will internationally begin a process 
of discussions with other countries in the hemisphere to break 
every trace of isolation. She recognized, however, "it will be a 
slow process that will not change rapidly." 
  Stewart said that despite the different views on the issue, 
her country must maintain an open dialogue in this regard with 
the United States, which has maintained a tight blockade against 
Cuba since 1962. 
  "The reality is that Canada is not the only country that has 
relations with Cuba," the official indicated, upon recalling 
that states from Europe and other parts of the world maintain 
ties with the island, which "offers opportunities for the 
countries of the world." 
  Regarding the position of Western hemisphere governments 
that 
Cuba must return to the OAS, Stewart said Canada will not impose 
conditions on that possibility "because we try to be respectful." 
  Under this purview, Stewart commented on the decision of 
Caribbean governments to include Cuba in the Caribbean States 
Association, which will be formed soon. Canada will support and 
promote this idea, the official stressed. 
  This reflects the fact that there is a growing understanding 
that Cuba's situation in the hemisphere must be revised, she 
commented. Stewart even said that Washington is gaining 
awareness of this and is reconsidering some points of its 
blockade policy, such as trips. 
  In this regard, the official considered, "we must promote 
opening toward Cuba in the United States." Stewart referred to 
the position of a growing number of Cubans in the United States 
that this country must soften its rather ideological stand 
towards Cuba. According to Stewart, other nations in the 
hemisphere have adopted this position, and this could have an 
impact on U.S. policy. 
  In light of criticism from the U.S. over Ottawa's decision 
to 
strengthen its ties with Havana, Stewart underscored that 
"despite the differences with the United States, with whom we 
held discussions at the OAS annual assembly, the reality is that 
I am here in Cuba and we will continue to increase our ties with 
the island." 
  Stewart's visit is the most important by a Canadian official 
to Cuba since 1976, when then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau 
traveled to Havana. 
  During a busy work schedule, Stewart met with President 
Fidel 
Castro, Vice President Carlos Lage, Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina, National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, and the 
ministers of finance and prices and foreign investments and 
cooperation, Jose Luis Rodriguez and Ernesto Melendez, 
respectively. 
  On Monday evening, Stewart inaugurated, together with Lage, 
an international conference on business opportunities on the 
island, sponsored by the British magazine, THE ECONOMIST. This 
conference is being attended by over 120 business executives 
from Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Europe, and Latin 
America. 
  At the conference on Monday evening, Stewart praised the 
efforts of the Cuban State to try to preserve social programs 
such as education and health, amid an acute economic crisis. 
She expressed Canada's willingness to assist the island in 
whatever way it could. Stewart took the opportunity to announce 
the resumption of official economic aid from Ottawa to Havana, 
suspended in 1978, and she stressed her government's willingness 
to promote Canadian investment in Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canada's 
minister of state for Latin America and Africa, today endorsed 
her country's investments in Cuba while addressing a conference 
organized by British publication THE ECONOMIST. 
  Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, Christine Stewart, and an 
executive from the publication sponsoring the event opened the 
conference entitled "Second Roundtable With the Government of 
Cuba," which formally begins two days of working sessions 
tomorrow behind closed doors. 
  The Canadian Government supports increased investments in 
Cuba not only because they contribute to this country's 
development, but because they also benefit Canada, the minister 
explained. 
  Canada currently exerts a great deal of influence in foreign 
investments in Cuba's mining sector, not only in the traditional 
nickel sector, but also in exploring for gold, lead, copper, and 
oil deposits. 
  Stewart conveyed the Canadian Government's willingness to 
further promote the flow of capital toward Cuba. It was also 
announced in Ottawa today that developmental aid will be made 
available, as well as $360,000 in emergency food aid, which will 
be granted through the World Food Program. A larger amount, 
$720,000, will be donated to the food program in 1995. 
  Meanwhile, Lage stressed the importance of having such a 
renowned publication as THE ECONOMIST organizing this 
conference, as well as having Canadian companies such as Sherrit 
Inc. cosponsoring it. The conference has an even greater 
significance in light of the current economic hardships Cuba is 
facing. 
  Octavio Castilla, spokesman for the conference and deputy 
minister for foreign investment and economic cooperation, 
believes the most significant message conveyed by Lage was that 
regardless of all the flaws the Cuban legal system might have, 
there is a willingness to analyze those flaws and to implement 
reforms that further encourage the introduction of foreign 
capital. 
  More than 100 businessmen and officials from Europe, Canada, 
the United States, and Latin America are participating in this 
conference. Formal reports will be given tomorrow by Enrique 
Martinez, vice president of the Cuban Central Planning Board; 
Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas; and Ernesto Melendez, 
president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today, Cuban Vice Foreign 
Minister Jorge Bolanos said the restoration of Canadian aid to 
Cuba reflects that country's rejection of any measure aimed at 
isolating the nation. 
  We intend to maintain and develop ties between the two 
countries, Bolanos said, adding Cuba is Canada's first trade 
partner in the Caribbean and Central American region. 
  Praising the decision, the Cuban vice foreign minister said 
the resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 due to Cuba's 
presence in Angola, opens a new phase in our bilateral 
relations, which "have always been prominent." 
  Bolanos said the main issue in this decision is the 
political 
effect it will have. The formal announcement of the restoration 
of aid to Havana was made in this capital by Christine Stewart, 
Canadian minister of state for Latin America and Africa, who 
spoke against isolating the island. 
  According to Bolanos, Stewart invited, on behalf of Canadian 
Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina to Ottawa, and the invitation will be honored sometime 
this year. 
  Canada, as Mexico, never severed its commercial or 
diplomatic 
ties with Havana and has expressed opposition to the blockade 
the United States imposed more than 30 years ago.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- In what Ottawa views as "a 
new page in its relations with Cuba," on Monday, Canada restored 
economic aid to the island as part of its humanitarian foreign 
aid program and to foster development. 
  The decision was simultaneously announced in the Canadian 
capital by Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and in Havana by 
Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and 
Africa, who today concludes a two-day visit to the island. 
  While Stewart was meeting a full agenda of interviews with 
ranking Cuban Government officials, in Ottawa, Foreign Minister 
Ouellet announced the resumption of official economic aid to the 
Caribbean island. 
  "The Cold War is over. The time has come to turn a new page" 
in relations with Cuba, Ouellet said in reference to the 
resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 when Cuba 
provided military aid to Angola in response to South Africa's 
aggression. 
  Despite that decision, ties between the two states continued 
to develop, and they were expanded in 1989 when the two 
countries decided to undertake a political dialogue with an 
exchange of official visits. 
  According to the announcement, Canada will grant Cuba 
$360,000 to feed the children this year and $720,000 in 1995. 
  Last night, Stewart inaugurated an international 
businessmen's conference on business opportunities in Cuba. The 
conference, which was sponsored by the magazine THE ECONOMIST, 
was attended by more than 120 executives from Canadian, British, 
U.S., European, and Latin American firms. 
  Earlier, Stewart had discussed the development of bilateral 
relations, particularly economic relations, with Cuban Vice 
President Carlos Lage and other ranking officials, including 
Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly President 
Ricardo Alarcon; Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the 
State Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Jose Luis 
Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for 
Finance. A source from the Canadian delegation also confirmed 
to PRENSA LATINA that the minister of state also held a special 
meeting with President Fidel Castro. 
  In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Eduardo del Rey, spokesman 
for the Canadian Foreign Ministry and a member of Stewart's 
entourage, stressed: "This is an important moment in the 
relationship between Cuba and Canada," which is based on 
"frequent and honest dialogue." Rey added that the goal of 
Stewart's visit is to broaden those ties and promote Canadian 
investments. 
  At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart 
said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not 
only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also 
because Canada will benefit. 
  Stewart expressed the Canadian authorities' resolve to 
encourage an even greater flow of capital to the island, where 
Canada currently carries considerable weight in foreign 
investments in the mining sector. Canada does not only exploit 
traditional nickel deposits, but it also has recently been 
involved in prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as 
exploring for oil deposits. Furthermore, Canada is the leading 
source of tourists to the island, where every year more than 
120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canadian 
minister of state for Latin America and Africa, said here today 
that she enjoyed a very interesting conversation with President 
Fidel Castro, with whom she analyzed the development of 
bilateral relations. 
  The Canadian official, who ended her working tour of Havana 
this Tuesday, said during a news conference that she met with 
the Cuban statesman last night and talked about the island's 
current economic difficulties as well as Canada's domestic 
problems. 
  It was "a very interesting, pleasant conversation with a man 
who has a warm personality, who is obviously interested in the 
world around him, who has a great love for his country, and who, 
in my opinion, only wants the best for his fatherland," the 
minister of state asserted. 
  The objective of Stewart's visit was to increase relations 
and further Canadian investments. She is the highest ranking 
official from Ottawa to visit the Caribbean country in 18 years, 
since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's trip to Havana in 
1976. 
  Regarding her meetings with Fidel Castro and other top local 
officials, Stewart emphasized that Canada has no intention of 
dictating solutions to Cuban problems and only wants an 
opportunity to exchange experiences with the hope that both 
parties can learn from each other. "We want to make sure that 
Cubans know they can count on our experiences." 
  Stewart said Fidel Castro appreciated Ottawa's decision to 
officially renew economic aid to the island, and they both 
agreed that "this is only the beginning of new ways that Canada 
can help Cuba." 
  Aid was suspended in 1978 because Cuba gave military 
assistance to Angola when it was attacked by South Africa. That 
decision, however, did not negatively affect the development of 
their ties, especially in the commercial and tourism sectors. 
  Stewart announced a modest package of $360,000 in food for 
children and pregnant women this year and another $700,000 for 
1995. She also promised that, upon her return, she would study 
ways to better assist the Caribbean island. 
  On another topic, the Canadian minister of state emphasized 
Canada's growing interest in conducting business with Cuba, 
especially in establishing mixed enterprises that will yield 
mutual benefits. She also highlighted the willingness of 
authorities in Ottawa to encourage the investment of Canadian 
capital in Cuba.

  [Text] Havana, 22 Jun (PL) -- Addressing attendees of a 
conference, which closed today, sponsored by the British 
publishing house THE ECONOMIST, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto 
Robaina invited those countries that had the courage to vote 
against the U.S. embargo to invest in Cuba. 
  The minister, who said Cuba "works with determination," 
admitted the U.S. Administration "does what it can rather than 
what it wants" regarding Cuba, and he characterized this 
government as being less aggressive than that of its Republican 
predecessors. 
  Mentioning the critical economic situation, Robaina said 
there is nothing more tense or a greater challenge in Cuba today 
than a housewife trying to prepare breakfast, lunch, and dinner 
for her family. He said the country is living and changing, 
however. 
  Robaina said those of the new generation, which includes 
half 
the Cuban population, have their goals and desires, but they 
dream with their feet firmly planted on the ground. "Twice we 
removed forms of government and mechanisms that did not conform 
to our reality. We have had this experience for the second 
time." He said he hopes the changes will be implemented as 
rapidly as possible "because we Cubans are the most interested 
in eliminating shortages." 
  Robaina told the more than 170 businessmen and bankers 
attending the event that Cuba "is not interested in other people 
sharing their views but, rather, in these views being considered 
when Cuba is discussed." He added: "Most of those who invest in 
Cuba are neither for nor against our economic model, but they 
are tired of hearing predictions that the Cuban Government will 
collapse, predictions which do not happen." 
  Robaina also said: "The mere fact that you are present here 
and helping us look at our situation from a different angle is 
an indication of the changes and credibility of our project. 
You are already part of that miracle." 
  The participants of the event will attended a reception 
tonight, offered by the Cuban Government.

<F P=106> [By Elsy Fors: "Portal: The North Americans Will Arrive Too </F>
Late for Cuban Mining"] 
  [Text] Havana, 23 Jun (PL) -- The North Americans will not 
arrive late; they are already too late to invest in Cuban 
mining, Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal has said here at 
the conference sponsored by the British publishing house THE 
ECONOMIST. 
  During the second round table with the Cuban Government, 
which ended yesterday, Portal gave a detailed report on foreign 
participation in the island's mining and petroleum development 
to more than 170 businessmen and bankers from 23 countries. 
  According to official figures, Cuba estimates there are more 
than 300 million tons of nickel and cobalt reserves in 30 
deposits in the country. To date, Portal said, Cuba has signed 
26 contracts for mineral prospecting and exploration, two 
service contracts for exploitation of copper in Mantua, Pinar 
del Rio Province, and two partnerships for feasibility studies 
on gold, lead, and zinc deposits. These agreements already 
cover 50 percent of the area open to bidding in a total area of 
40,000 square km. 
  Portal said the nickel industry has recovered and increased 
its markets, adding the Cuban-mined mineral is now exported to 
26 countries. This sector obtained financial support from 
institutions in Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and 
Italy. 
  In petroleum prospecting, 16 of the 33 areas with 
potentially 
great prospects have already been contracted out to French, 
Canadian, British, and Swedish companies. The minister also 
said the total area will have been contracted by the end of the 
year, so "it is not a matter of the North Americans arriving 
late; they are already too late" to participate in these 
projects. 
  The companies that are already participating are prospering, 
recovering the invested capital with part of the extracted 
petroleum. Partnerships have been established for the useful 
life of the fields, and this exhibits confidence in Cuba's 
guarantees, Portal added. During his participation in the round 
table, Portal received investment proposals. 
  The cosponsorship of the conference by the Canadian firm 
Sherritt, which has made large investments in Cuban petroleum, 
gas, and nickel, is evidence of foreign interest in the 
prospects of this sector of the local economy.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Justice Minister Carlos Amat 
Fores has announced that Cuba will increase activities aimed at 
stopping the use of its airspace and territorial waters by 
international drug traffickers to ship drugs to the U.S. 
consumer market. 
  Cuba is waging a merciless fight against drug traffickers, 
Amat said in an interview with BOHEMIA magazine. In the 
interview, Amat stressed Cuba's willigness to cooperate with 
other nations in combating the trafficking of hallucinogens. 
  Amat said the island's adverse economic situation following 
the loss of its traditional markets in the former European 
socialist camp has not noticeably affected the nation's drug 
prevention programs. 
  On the contrary, by virtue of our experience and the maximum 
use of our available resources, we have increased our 
effectiveness and zeal in surveillance, Amat remarked. 
  Amat said that because of its geographic position, Cuba is 
located on a direct line between the world's main drug consumer 
market -- the United States -- and the primary drug producing 
regions in South America. 
  He said drug traffickers are continuing their modus operandi 
in Cuba, mainly tossing packages of drugs into the sea to be 
picked up later by accomplices. Frequently, these packages are 
carried by the ocean currents onto the island's shores. 
  Amat said that last year, a total of 79 packages containing 
3,364.39 kg of drugs washed up on Cuban beaches. This 
represented a 104 percent increase over 1992. 
  In terms of international cooperation in the fight against 
this scourge, he pointed out that over the past two years, Cuba 
has signed agreements with Mexico, Venezuela, Barbados, Guyana, 
and Argentina, as well as a letter of intent with Colombia. 
  Amat said some unofficial contacts have continued with the 
United States. These contacts have resulted in certain kinds of 
bilateral cooperation, such as the exchange of information and 
evidence, and even the handing over of people implicated in a 
drug trafficking case. Amat said: We think U.S. professionals 
in this field are more and more interested in these 
relationships, and so are we.

  [Text] Washington, 23 Jun (PL) -- The U.S. Federal 
Government and the Florida State Government will implement a 
program intended to control the massive flow of refugees to the 
coasts of this southern U.S. state. 
  U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno made this announcement 
today. She did not provide the details of this operation, 
called Short Distance, however. She said the operation is still 
being prepared. 
  Reno pointed out that details of the operation are being 
coordinated with Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and that the 
operation will be implemented promptly with the support of the 
Pentagon and other government organizations. 
  According to its designers in the Justice Department, the 
Short Distance operation is intended to help the coastal states, 
especially Florida, control the entrance of refugees coming 
mainly from Haiti and Cuba. 
  According to reports, concentration centers will be set up 
and the Army and other government agencies will provide 
provisions, while asylum applications are being processed.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Tomas A. Granados: "Miami After </F>
Cartagena"] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] After organizing four 
summits through their own initiative to discuss matters of 
cooperation and integration, and without relying on the United 
States whatsoever, later this year Latin American leaders will 
go to a meeting convened by President Bill Clinton in the city 
of Miami. 
  According to an announcement from U.S. authorities, the goal 
of this event will be to establish the rules of the game for 
what the White House has called "a new era in inter-American 
relations." 
  The last time a U.S. president met with the presidents of 
the 
hemisphere was in 1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, when 
Washington sought political loyalty at any cost, fearful of the 
gradual advancement of communism in this region in the years of 
East-West confrontation. 
  Times have changed, however, and, although the loyalty of 
the 
hemisphere continues to be of paramount importance for the 
United States, it appears to be inclined to offer new incentives 
to continue to enjoy that loyalty. Michael Skol, who is second 
in charge of Inter-American affairs in the State Department, 
says that the countries south of the Rio Grande now have the 
opportunity to become First World members jointly with the 
United States. 
  "We want to consider two topics: First, how to strengthen 
our democracies, defending them as a group and improving our 
administration; and second, how to promote economic growth, 
while promoting a sustained development strategy that will 
protect the environment and alleviate poverty," Clinton said 
when he formally convened the summit at a brief ceremony on 11 
March at the White House. 
  At least this is the emphasis that has been placed on 
preparations for the hemispheric summit, which is scheduled to 
be held the first half of December in the city of Miami. 
  The meeting convened by Clinton will take place six months 
after the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, 
Colombia. Some foreign ministries of the continent have ruled 
out the possibility that Washington has an interest in offering 
an alternative to such summits. 
  Nobody, however, has been able to explain Washington's 
decision to choose Vice President Albert Gore to make the 
announcement of the proposed hemispheric conference during his 
late 1993 visit to Mexico -- the country that hosted the first 
Ibero-American summit held in July 1991 in Guadalajara. 
  Professor Henry Raymont, a Latin American expert at the 
University of Boston, was surprised by the person and venue 
chosen for the announcement of the planned summit. His first 
conclusion was that the White House had made a mistake, because 
it lessened the impact of the initiative, but in politics and 
diplomacy, nothing, or virtually nothing, happens by chance. 
  The hemispheric summit in Miami appears destined to become 
the forum that will permit the United States to guarantee its 
own interests in the region through new practices that promote 
the cooperation of Latin America and the Caribbean. This will 
be done within the limits of an initiative based on three 
pillars of Washington's foreign policy: economic development, 
national security, and promotion of democracy worldwide. 
  Nevertheless, there are still lingering old prejudices of 
the 
Cold War in the handing out of invitations to governments 
accepted as democratic by Washington. The Clinton 
administration, moved by the old ideological differences with 
authorities in Havana, has excluded Cuba. 
  "If Cuba is excluded, one might question the sense of the 
meeting," according to Jose Serrano, New York Democratic 
representative and leader of the group of U.S. legislators of 
Hispanic origin. 
  "The U.S. Government speaks of holding a summit with all of 
the leaders of democracies in America. I think the best way to 
hold such a dialogue in this part of the world is by including 
everyone, regardless of what government philosophy they might 
have," he added. 
  According to the Clinton administration, Miami was chosen as 
the site of the summit because of the active interaction of that 
city with Latin America and the Caribbean. Still, there might 
be other reasons. 
  One is that many of the governments that were invited 
maintain normal relations with the Havana authorities and do not 
support the U.S. economic blockade policy against Cuba. 
  Therefore, Miami appears to be an ideal site for Washington 
in order that no one who wants to avoid conflicts with the 
influential extremist sector will dare speak of lifting the 
blockade against Cuba, much less hint -- even remotely -- of the 
need for a negotiated settlement of differences between 
Washington and Havana.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- Today's GRANMA newspaper 
confirmed Cuba will not authorize anyone's departure from the 
country who forcefully enters an embassy in this capital. 
  In an editorial on the recent occupations of the Belgian and 
German embassies and the Chilean consulate, the official 
newspaper of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba stressed the 
only solution for the embassy occupiers, who number slightly 
more than 100 and want to travel to the United States, "is to 
unconditionally withdraw the same way they entered." 
  The newspaper explains that the Cuban Government has 
guaranteed the German and Belgian Governments that the people 
involved in the incidents, except those charged with common 
crimes, will be granted immunity and returned to their homes. 
  Recalling the various methods used by different U.S. 
Administrations to encourage desertions and proclaim "with noisy 
and loud publicity" the need to exterminate the "bad example" 
Cuba has set on the continent, the newspaper states there has 
been a recent intensification in the encouragement of illegal 
escapes and forceful embassy occupations. 
  To foster these irresponsible actions, GRANMA adds, there 
has 
been a systematic denial of visas to individuals seeking 
immigration. Immigration agreements have been violated, and 
although legal obstacles are increasing, the coasts remain open 
for well publicized welcomes to individuals who survive the 
odyssey. Many people in Miami have made a profitable business 
out of trafficking humans, the newspaper states. 
  If the purpose of this were truly humanitarian, the 
editorial 
states, it would suffice to grant visas to whomever has 
requested one, to ban illegal entries to U.S. territory, and to 
offer residency facilities. The newspaper states, however, that 
it is "a matter of a promised land that is not granted unless a 
person risks his life." 
  This is the case of the people who are occupying the three 
missions, the newspaper says, explaining that among the guests 
at the Belgian Embassy are 25 children, among them the youngest 
"political refugee" on earth because he is only a few months old. 
  Also in the group are 25 individuals prosecuted for common 
crimes, 34 who have been issued repeated warnings for markedly 
antisocial behavior, and 46 have returned to their homes. 
  The newspaper describes as "much more serious" the fact that 
the alleged refugees, who have occupied the Belgian ambassador's 
residence, have used it to establish an alleged organization, 
distribute propaganda, and put up posters. 
  The newspaper adds: "We must remember embassies cannot be 
used as centers of political activities against their host 
countries because to do so would violate the functions for which 
they are accredited." 
  GRANMA states the Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted 
responsibly by instructing its ambassador to inform his guests 
of the illegality of their action. 
  We are respectful of every individuals' right to live 
wherever he chooses, but we cannot allow ourselves to be taken 
in by allowing embassies to classify simple immigrants under 
nonexistent categories for personal, familiar, or economic 
reasons or simply to seek an adventure, the newspaper stated, 
adding "this just goes too far." 
  It would be easy to clear the way for those who decide to 
occupy embassies, adds the newspaper, which then asks the 
question, "Who would be harmed by that? Who would be at the 
mercy of any intruder seeking the immunity of an embassy's 
territory for the purpose of migrating?" 
  GRANMA also asks what the position of the governments of 
these countries would be if the Haitians, who are now being 
repatriated en masse, chose instead to break into their 
embassies or if the Mexican wetbacks chose to jump the fences of 
European or Latin American embassies in Mexico City instead of 
risking their lives on the border? 
  Cuba, the newspaper maintains, is responsible for protecting 
the embassies and is duty bound to safeguard the immunity and 
inviolateness of their territories and will honor this 
commitment to the letter. 
  The best guarantee for those who represent their countries 
in 
Cuba, the editorial states, is that the experience of three 
decades of resisting blackmail, a blockade, and direct and 
indirect aggressions has taught us we cannot yield 1 inch. A 
principle surrendered is a principle lost, the newspaper states. 
  The newspaper asks other questions, including: What do they 
expect? The beginning of a new style of obtaining documents in 
Cuba to enter a country, different from existing methods in 
other capitals? Is it an effort to artificially create a 
political situation for purposes suspiciously similar to those 
with which the United States has been unsuccessful? Was it an 
effort to taint the atmosphere surrounding our country during 
the recently concluded Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena 
de Indias? 
  After stressing Cuba will not tolerate pressures regardless 
of from where they may come, GRANMA confirmed the Cuban Foreign 
Ministry is totally willing to cooperate with accredited 
diplomatic missions to sensibly resolve their problem and even 
to prevent future difficulties.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Manuel Navarro Escobedo: "Korea: </F>
Dialogue vs. Sanctions"] 
  [Text] [No dateline as received] The announced talks 
between DPRK President Kim Il-song and ROK President Kim 
Yong-sam should contribute to greater mutual confidence, which 
can ease the prevailing warlike climate and threat of sanctions 
against the sides involved in the Korean peninsula's nuclear 
dispute. 
  This summit of Kims could take place anytime and anywhere -- 
presumably in Pyongyang, Seoul, or, if this is not possible, 
then Beijing -- with no preconditions, as expressed in the 
invitation extended by the DPRK president to the ROK president 
and delivered in Seoul by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. 
  This would be the first time in history that the leaders of 
both parts of Korea have met since the country was divided in 
1948, when the North and the South declared themselves 
republics. An attempt at reunification, which failed to 
crystallize, was made in 1991 after several official contacts 
between the two prime ministers. 
  Asian diplomatic sources do not rule out the PRC as the site 
of the negotiations, considering this country's good relations 
with the two neighboring states, and the desire to spare the 
octogenarian DPRK leader a long trip. 
  The sources base their assertions on the fact that Beijing 
is 
one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and 
that, since the beginning of the problem in February 1993, the 
PRC has rejected pressure tactics and threats and favored a 
conciliatory solution. Beijing's veto power could cancel any UN 
resolution. 
  In addition, Kim Il-song always uses a special train in his 
short trips abroad, both to Europe and in Asia. This has been 
interpreted as a sign that he cannot travel by air. 
  Carter, rector of a democratic foundation, traveled on a 
private mission to Seoul and Pyongyang in mid-June with the goal 
of finding a peaceful resolution to the complex and critical 
nuclear controversy, which has kept the world on tenterhooks 
because of the disturbing political and military maneuvers over 
the past 16 months. 
  In addition, the mediation of the former White House 
occupant 
(1976-1980) took place at a time when the United States had 
presented to the UN Security Council a draft resolution that 
considers six punitive measures against the DPRK for its 
reluctance to authorize a complete and thorough inspection of 
its nine nuclear plants following an alleged diversion of 
nuclear fuel. 
  Madeline Albright, Washington's delegate to the United 
Nations, outlined the draft resolution's contents, which include 
severe measures leading to a tight embargo if Pyongyang does not 
change its position. The document, which has been endorsed by 
Japan, the ROK, France, Great Britain, and other Washington 
allies, proposes temporarily isolating the DPRK diplomatically, 
beginning at the time when the measures are adopted. All 
technical cooperation, particularly that involving nuclear 
energy, and economic aid by the United Nations and its agencies 
would likewise be cut off. 
  In an apparently concerted action, the Board of Directors of 
the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] anticipated this 
punitive plan and on 10 June suspended a yearly allocation of 
$270,000 in technical assistance for the DPRK, which had been a 
member since 1985 but has announced its decision to leave the 
organization. 
  The draft resolution also calls for limiting Pyongyang's 
activities in international organizations and establishing 
controls on all scientific, economic, and educational exchanges 
with the DPRK. The document bans the import and export of arms 
and weapon components and all unscheduled air traffic to and 
from DPRK. 
  This draft, prepared by Washington, which is expected to be 
vetoed by the PRC and Russia -- Pyongyang's most important trade 
partners -- gives the DPRK a 30-day grace period to 
unconditionally fulfill the Nuclear Safeguards Agreement and the 
inter-Korean accord on the denuclearization of the peninsula 
signed in October 1991. 
  In this agreement, which was hailed by the world, the DPRK 
and ROK heads of government pledged to refrain from developing, 
manufacturing, or storing nuclear weapons. In direct reference 
to the United States, the two countries supported the removal of 
all nuclear arms from this northwest Asian region. Since it was 
signed, however, the agreement has been a paper tiger. 
  According to unofficial reports, Pyongyang possesses nine 
nuclear plants, Seoul has four, and the Pentagon has installed 
more than 1,000 nuclear devices, including rockets and bombs of 
various types, in U.S. military bases throughout the ROK, where 
more than 40,000 soldiers are stationed. 
  Nevertheless, the U.S. efforts to implement punitive 
measures 
have virtually come to a standstill and appear unlikely to 
succeed in light of Russia's and the PRC's refusal to support 
the proposal and pressure from U.S. public sectors that favor a 
negotiated solution. 
  Meanwhile, the leaders of Russia, who maintain a friendship 
and cooperation agreement with Pyongyang and sell weapons to the 
DPRK, have accused Washington of not consulting with them, and 
they have called for an international conference among China, 
Japan, the two Koreas, and the UN in an attempt to end the 
conflict. 
  The Chinese, Pyongyang's powerful allies from the Korean war 
(1950-1953), who firmly oppose any coercive measures and are 
summoning the parties in the conflict to a dialogue and to 
settle their differences, warn that sanctions will only engender 
negative results. China says its goal is to denuclearize the 
peninsula and to preserve peace and stability. 
  North Korea has warned, meanwhile, that sanctions would 
constitute a declaration of war. It also argues that the 
country does not intend to or have the capability to produce a 
nuclear weapon, and it is claiming that there is a plot which, 
it says, is aimed at suppressing the country's socialist 
political system. 
  Encouraged by Washington, Seoul voiced its support for the 
sanctions and consequently decreed a state of emergency for its 
troops and civilian population, thereby sowing a climate of war 
south of the 38th parallel. 
  The heated dispute has naturally created concern among U.S. 
citizens, who in the long run are the ones who suffer casualties 
(dead, wounded, and missing) in conflicts in which their 
government gets involved. In the past, they have been 
traumatized by defeats in Korea (1953) and Vietnam (1975). 
  This fear was reflected in a survey published by influential 
NEWSWEEK magazine in its 18 June edition, the results of which 
showed that the majority of U.S. citizens favor a negotiated 
solution through the resumption of a high-level dialogue between 
Washington and Pyongyang. So far, there have been meetings in 
New York (June) and Geneva (July) in 1993. There is a 
possibility that a third meeting could take place within the 
next few months as a result of Jimmy Carter's mediation. 
  The figures published by NEWSWEEK reveal the general feeling 
on the subject: 68 percent of those consulted favor a 
negotiated solution, while only 25 percent prefer a hard-line 
solution. In the same survey, 42 percent disapproved of 
President William Clinton's policy toward Korea, which was only 
supported by 31 percent. 
  A careful analysis of the true nature of the conflict will 
take us back to 15 February 1993, when a special IAEA team tried 
to carry out a special inspection of two military installations. 
North Korean authorities turned back the inspection, which they 
viewed as a violation of the country's sovereignty and national 
independence. 
  Pyongyang accused the IAEA of plotting with the United 
States 
to conduct an espionage mission within its military centers, and 
on 12 March the DPRK announced its decision to withdraw from the 
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), which would have gone 
into effect three months later, on 12 June, as stipulated in its 
regulations. At the same time, the DPRK demanded talks with 
Washington. 
  The DPRK joined the NPT in 1985 and signed the Nuclear 
Safeguards Agreement in 1992. Since then, inspectors visited 
the seven atomic energy plants subject to verification on six 
occasions and certified that they were being used for peaceful 
purposes. 
  Since then, a bitter dispute developed between the parties 
involved, which were followed by intensive political efforts 
conducted by several countries and the UN Security Council in an 
attempt to find a satisfactory formula to ease tensions on the 
Korean peninsula. 
  A UN Security Council resolution, approved with the 
abstentions of China and Pakistan, urged the DPRK to reconsider 
its withdrawal from the NPT and its refusal to permit IAEA 
inspections. A refusal from the DPRK would be subject to 
economic sanctions. 
  Washington agreed to negotiate as demanded by Pyongyang. 
U.S. and DPRK representatives met at UN Headquarters in New 
York. On 12 June, the DPRK temporarily delayed its withdrawal 
from the NPT. The representatives again met in Geneva in July 
that same year. Since then, contact at the Foreign 
Ministry-level was interrupted, and there have only been brief 
working sessions by officials in Beijing and New York whenever 
the situation warrants. 
  As specific results of those ministerial meetings, the 
United 
States committed itself to suspend its Team Spirit annual 
military exercises in South Korea and help Pyongyang change its 
graphite reactors for light water reactors, which would prevent 
the fabrication of nuclear weapons. In addition, it offered to 
consider the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations, 
and give its economic and technical support. 
  The DPRK agreed to resume its contacts with South Korea to 
exchange ambassadors and let IAEA inspectors do their work to 
guarantee safeguards. 
  Everything seemed to be moving along normally until April 
1994, when a series of proposals, counterproposals, pressures, 
and threats of sanctions again increased tension in the Korean 
peninsula. This time, it was because the United States and the 
IAEA suspected that the DPRK was storing plutonium extracted 
from nuclear rods from its plants. 
  From all of this we can conclude that the next high-level 
meeting between the North and South Koreas, together with 
Pyongyang's offer to freeze its nuclear program and its 
invitation to inspect its installations, should contribute to 
reduce the current pressure and threats on the peninsula.

  [Text] Havana, 21 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Government has 
approved regulations to Law Decree No. 149, which covers the 
confiscation of goods and income obtained through illegal 
enrichment. 
  A Council of Ministers Executive Committee agreement 
establishes the method to be followed in such cases. Already, 
several dozen people have been found to be involved in illegal 
activities regarding the obtainment of goods. Files on these 
individuals have been opened. 
  According to information published by GRANMA today, the 
regulations detail the conditions established for preliminary 
investigations, the resources available for the accused, the 
procedures to review cases, the preventive measures to avoid the 
distribution of stolen goods, and the final destination of 
stolen goods. 
  The document outlines the procedures to be practiced by 
prosecutors, which include the possibility of searching the 
houses of suspects, their relatives, or third parties, as well 
as conducting necessary audits, inventories, and appraisals. 
  After the reform resource and the review procedure, which 
are 
to be presented to Finance and Price Minister, and the final 
ruling on the case, no other process will be established in the 
administrative or judicial sectors. 
  Lastly, the regulations clarify that the organizations in 
charge will be responsible for the preservation, custody, and 
distribution of goods and income that are subject to preventive 
or confiscatory measures.

<F P=106> [Exclusive report by Miguel Lozano: "The Hour of the Chosen </F>
Ones"] 
  [Text] Havana -- Each evening in May and June, thousands of 
Cubans will have to make a decision: whether to attend a 
neighbors meeting to analyze community problems or to watch the 
island's most popular soap opera, "Felicidad." 
  For municipal representatives (councilmen), the Brazilian 
soap opera constitutes the first trial by fire during these warm 
nights. The number of voters who will decide to skip the soap 
opera will be larger in those places where there is more 
confidence in their performances. 
  These meetings to "account for one's actions" represent an 
initial aspect of the Cuban "sui generis" democratic system, 
designed to facilitate people's participation in domestic 
affairs without interfering with the constitutional foundation 
of the single-party system. 
  According to prevalent belief, the existence of a single 
party is justified by the need to have unity to preserve 
sovereignty in view of the pressure exerted by the Unites 
States, including an economic, commercial, and financial 
blockade and hundreds of hours of anti-government radio messages 
coming from that country on a daily basis. 
  Although this concept -- applied to the party founded to 
organize last century's fight for independence -- has broad 
support, a stated government concern is to facilitate people's 
participation in elections where candidates are chosen by the 
neighbors themselves rather than by groups. 
  The chosen ones are responsible for holding meetings with 
their constituencies at least twice a year to account for their 
actions. In addition, voters have the chance of dismissing the 
councilman who fails to accomplish his mission or who no longer 
meets the requirements to represent them. 
  Theoretically, this system has countless advantages if 
compared with a representative democracy, whereby candidates are 
chosen by their own parties rather than by the population, and 
once they are chosen, their voters can no longer contact, 
criticize, or evaluate them. 
  In practice, however, this system has some shortcomings that 
have conspired against it. This is something that high-ranking 
Cuban officials have recognized, although they believe overall 
results are positive, especially at times of crises when the 
population's full support is vital. 
  One such problem is the elimination of formalism, once 
delegates (councilmen) fall under the influence of the 
bureaucratic plague. During the processes to account for one's 
actions prior to the summer (the other processes take place 
during the last months of the year) and with the help of 
democratic representatives, the aim is to give an identity to 
the search for solutions to the problems inherent in each 
community to meet the people's demands. 
  Ernesto Suarez, National Assembly of the People's Government 
(parliament) secretary, told a group of local journalists that 
we can see that this change of identity cannot be accomplished 
instantly, not even before the conclusion of the meetings held 
by the 13,685 councilmen. 
  In some cases, these democratic representatives fail to 
attend the neighborhood meetings held to find solutions to 
water, hygiene, transportation, and food distribution problems, 
which the loss of Cuba's main trade partners, triggered by the 
fall of the European socialist world, exacerbated. 
  In other cases, the tendency of these representatives is "to 
report" on their works and to gather new concerns in order to 
address them six months later. This system not only fails to 
involve the population in the process to solve problems, but 
also distorts the meaning these meetings have as a basic element 
of the democratic system. 
  Suarez believes it is important to encourage people to exert 
their authority. Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon believes 
the trend indicates we are moving toward the creation of a true 
democratic system, although the country finds itself amid large 
raw materials shortages. 
  Alarcon, who admits there are flaws, maintains that this 
mechanism to control the chosen ones, along with the power to 
dismiss them, places the Cuban system above other systems due to 
an irrefutable reason: the people's participation in the 
decisionmaking process. 
  The Cuban parliament president points out one way to make 
progress in the creation of a real democracy is to prevent the 
processes to account for one's actions from becoming a ritual 
every six months. 
  Most people, however, seem to be slightly concerned about 
the 
comparisons between the degrees of democracy in other countries 
and are more interested in reporting those elements that 
obstruct the good development of the community to their 
neighborhood representative. 
  The search for solutions to deficiencies in the water supply 
and food distribution systems exceed any political arguments, 
which are stronger abroad than on the island. Cuban authorities 
are determined to prove the potential of a single-party 
democracy. 
  Neither media reports on the progress of the processes to 
account for one's actions nor street rumors indicate there are 
enough arguments against the island's political system, although 
there are some criticisms of the shortcomings of the 
administrative system in many places. 
  Although hardly reported abroad, these meetings between the 
chosen ones and their constituencies theoretically represent a 
revival of the original democracy, whereby ancient Greeks and 
their representatives would meet without the meddling of 
political parties. 
  Despite this reasonable thesis, the Cuban system is facing 
obstacles larger that its nightly competition against 
"Felicidad;" it is attempting to overcome its own mistakes and 
weaknesses to show the world there can be a single-party 
democracy, although the predominant trend dictates just the 
opposite.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Roberto Morejon] </F>
  [Text] Twenty-five days after more than 100 Cubans intent 
on leaving the country forced their way into the residence of 
the Belgian ambassador, negotiations to persuade these people to 
desist in their action remain deadlocked. Following the forced 
entry into the Belgian Embassy, other groups of Cubans 
separately entered into the German Embassy and the Chilean 
Consulate, but in none of these cases have Cuban authorities 
allowed the perpetrators of these illegal acts to leave the 
country. 
  A recent statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry was 
explicit enough to make potential violators give up their goal 
of violating the norms that regulate diplomatic sites worldwide. 
  This is not the first time groups have tried to use 
embassies 
or ambassador's residences as springboards for their immediate 
exit from Cuba because they believe that the fanfare of the act 
itself and the political character they want to give it will 
ease the way. 
  The Cuban authorities' position has always been to firmly 
deny such demands. In these new cases, as on previous occasions, 
the Cuban authorities have insisted that people who commit such 
crimes may return to their homes without facing charges, 
although the perpetrators will not be exempt from punishment for 
previous crimes or for crimes committed during the forced entry 
into a diplomatic site. 
  The previously mentioned Cuban Foreign Ministry statement 
was 
even more dynamic in confirming that anyone who enters a 
diplomatic site by force will never be authorized to leave the 
country, even if they later abandon the site. By stating 
clearly that people involved in such acts permanently lose the 
right to leave the country, the Cuban Government has taken the 
necessary steps to better protect embassies which, it seems, 
have become the target of individuals who would like to leave 
the island through this ill-suited path without being 
politically persecuted. 
  As Belgian, German, and Chilean diplomats have seen, the 
people they are harboring are not the object of political 
persecution. Moreover, it is very clear that these individuals 
are additions to a long list of Cubans who want to emigrate to 
the United States, but the U.S. Interests Section in Havana 
continues to grant visas with an eyedropper, denying visas to 
most of applicants. 
  With the Foreign Ministry's recent statement, Cuba has 
stressed its traditional policy of not giving in to pressure 
exerted by people who purport to emigrate by illegal and even 
violent means.

<F P=106> [Remarks by President Fidel Castro to unidentified members </F>
of Colombian solidarity groups at Cartagena de Indias on 16 June 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] [Crowd applauds, chants: "Fidel, Fidel, Fidel!" 
Unidentified speaker shouts: "Long live the Cuban Revolution!" 
Crowd shouts: "Viva!"] 
  [Castro] We have just held a meeting with an important group 
of businessmen and industrialists from Cartagena, Barranquilla, 
Colombia. Then suddenly I came over to meet with the solidarity 
groups. Well, those persons I talked with are magnificent 
people. Really. I was positively impressed. Many are already 
working; many have economic operations with Cuba. They export 
products, but they not only export products, they purchase 
products, especially numerous products from the pharmaceutical 
and biotechnology industry. In other words, trade between our 
two countries is being quickly developed. 
  Since it was such an abrupt change, I said: What is this? 
First I was told I would say something, then others would follow 
and say something. I said: Well, I have realized it is better 
for me say something, and then you can ask some questions. 
Things will be easy this way and I will not get confused here 
and start talking about plywood, lumber, airlines, tourism, 
merchandise, and all those things. [laughs] Well, we will help 
one another, a dialogue rather than a speech, and to answer 
questions, things you are interested in about the summit or 
whatever, meaning things about our country. I can tell you about 
things you are interested in. 
  First of all, I want to state our profound gratitude for 
your 
hospitality, for everyone's hospitality, in Cartagena, Colombia, 
particularly for your hospitality. I have seen you everywhere. 
Wherever I went, I saw people who looked like you. [laughter, 
applause] The faces, enthusiasm, warmth, hospitality everywhere 
we went within our busy schedule. Our schedule was very busy. 
Really. You know how the summits are. If you do not know, I will 
tell you. [laughter] I have tirelessly said this. 
  Based on my experience with the nonaligned-countries 
meetings 
-- Cuba hosted the sixth summit in 1979 and almost 100 heads of 
state and government attended it -- I say that heads of state 
and government are the most undisciplined people in the world. 
[laughter] Obviously, I cannot say the same about the 
illustrious colleagues with whom I met recently. Perhaps they 
can become disorganized in a nonaligned meeting, but here they 
were very organized. 
  In the nonaligned-countries summits, when it was time to 
hold 
meetings, apparently many people like what I like, meaning that 
the meetings... [pauses] I am not talking about meetings like 
this, which are so pleasant. I am talking about the work 
meetings we have in the government and the party. I have always 
said that what I like most about meetings are the recesses. 
[laughter] However, [chuckles] what many of these heads of state 
like most is to attend these meetings once in awhile. The rest 
of the time they come from all over the world and hold bilateral 
meetings; greet friends; and, when it is time for a morning 
session, the place is empty, there is no one. The ones from 
Africa are gathered here; those from other places are gathered 
elsewhere; and so on and so forth. 
  That is why they give the impression of being undisciplined. 
Some of them arrive and others follow; and, when a speaker is 
scheduled to take the floor early in the morning, war breaks out 
[laughter] because they do not want to address an empty hall. At 
least the halls were full here; people attended the meetings; 
and they behaved in a disciplined way. It was a positive 
impression. The schedule was busy, like I said, and bilateral 
meetings were held in the morning or in the evening. Actually, 
there was no time in the morning or in the evening. A meeting 
was scheduled for 0700. 
  I slept three hours the first day. I went to sleep at 0400 
and I was back on my feet at 0700 -- no, I was back on my feet 
at 0600. We had to bathe and all that. It was actually three 
hours -- from 0300 to 0600. The second day, I broke the record 
and slept five hours. That was a phenomenon. I do not know how I 
managed that, between 0200 and 0700. The third day, meaning last 
night, I slept two and a half hours. Things ended very late. I 
had to leave a table [laughter] because the heads of state were 
leaving and only a few people remained there. I had breakfast at 
2300; I literally had breakfast at 2300. I had drunk some coffee 
and some juice -- nothing else, not even some milk. At 2300, I 
managed to sit at a long table they had there. Well, I began to 
eat calmly -- not much. When you are in a hurry the best thing 
is to eat a little. I said I had to leave because... [pauses] I 
saw Gabriel Garcia Marquez sitting there with other people, and 
I wanted to go sit over there. I was tired of so much protocol 
but, like I said, I had eaten very little. I had a little bit of 
desert. I was served two small slices of coconut pie. I said: 
Well, I will eat a little bit of fiber. [chuckles] When I was 
halfway through the first slice of coconut pie, I was told: Let 
us go. [laughter] I had to get up. [chuckles] I asked: Why? Has 
something happened here? I was interrupted halfway through the 
small slice of coconut pie. [laughter] 
  Aside from that, I think I will have to visit the doctor to 
check my ears because... [pauses] To tell you the truth, it was 
a splendid concert with artists from many countries, including a 
Cuban artist, Carlos Vives, who was presented at the end, but 
someone's equipment must have broken down and they could not 
lower the volume. I think more cannon volleys were fired there 
than during the Battle of Berlin [laughter] because it was very 
noisy. There were moments when my ears hurt. I was not the only 
one whose ears hurt. I had to cover one of my ears. I feigned it 
like this [laughter] and I leaned back. [laughs] I was actually 
covering my ear because the noise was unbearable. 
  Anyway, we ended the meeting very late. I do not know why I 
had to get up. Perhaps people had to leave. I was told to get up 
and I asked why we had to get up. I could not even finish my 
slice of pie. What else could I do? I bid everyone farewell and 
moved over to Garcia Marquez' table. I felt liberated there. I 
had finally shaken off the burden of so much ceremony and the 
pressure of so many political leaders. I found a group of 
friends there -- I did not know some of them, but they were 
magnificent people -- and I stayed there for about two hours. 
That was why I slept so little last night. It is my fault, but I 
felt free there. I said: I come seeking asylum here. I come 
seeking asylum here. [laughter, applause] 
  The funny thing is Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin 
passed by after we had been talking for some time. I told her: I 
have sought asylum here. She answered: Very well, we welcome 
you. [laughter, applause] I said: Come here, Noemi. What kind of 
asylum are you thinking about? [laughter] I sought asylum at 
this table, you know, but I am firmly determined to return to 
Cuba. I want to have at least a small plot of land where I can 
rest, since so much is being said about eternal rest. Just 
imagine that, I said. [laughs] A small plot of land. [laughter, 
applause] 
  Those are anecdotes about the summit but the summit's 
schedule was certainly busy; and delays occurred because they 
tried to schedule too many things for such a small amount of 
time, and there was simply not enough time. Two days were not 
enough for such a busy schedule despite the hospitality, 
organization, and great security measures. The security measures 
organized by the Navy and Public Force members was excellent. 
Obviously, we were much more calm. Well, we are used to being 
calm everywhere. 
  You know that when we travel, there is immediately a flurry 
of activity since the hunting license has been established. 
[laughter] Even though hunting restrictions exist in the world; 
even though animals are protected; even though you cannot hunt 
whales, and rightfully so; and you cannot hunt lions and 
rhinoceros -- particularly the rhinoceros, because it is 
reported the rhinoceros' horn has I do not know what kind of 
aphrodisiac properties. [laughter] People go around killing 
rhinos, and they will exterminate the rhinoceros. Nevertheless, 
[chuckles] I am the only species for which there is no closed 
season in the year. [laughter, applause] 
  Ever since the CIA planned the first attempts to eliminate 
me, I have not been lucky enough to be left alone. They are 
always trying to see how they can get me wherever I move. I must 
be like an eel... [laughter] for I am very difficult to catch 
and I get away. [laughter] There are always people from Miami at 
ceremonies like this, not just reporters from 
counterrevolutionary stations, but many disguised as reporters. 
I will never forget that during a visit to Chile many years ago, 
there were several cameras in front of me and one of them had a 
gun inside it. The cameraman was posing as a Venezuelan 
journalist, with a gun. I was right in front of him. 
Fortunately, they are not suicidal, they are not fanatics. Those 
are the dangerous ones, the crazy ones. These are crazy, but 
they are crazy for money. [chuckles] They want to enjoy that 
money in this life. [laughter] 
  This has occurred many times, meaning the organized hunts. 
They mobilize people if we go to this or that place; if we go to 
Spain. They want to see what opportunity they have, what chance 
they have. I do not tell you this to pose as a courageous 
person, only to give you an idea of how difficult it is to 
travel. They are around; they are the last ones to leave because 
they are paid to cause problems, make things difficult, create 
scandals if possible. They watch the hotel entrance and 
sometimes it is difficult to leave. That is how it has been. It 
is not an easy task, but that is how it has been. It has been 
rich in experiences, very interesting. 
  There is something we have not lacked at any time: the 
warmth 
and hospitality of the people in Cartagena, and that encourages 
us a great deal. I have had to sign some autographs even though 
I am not an artist [laughter] and I have had to pose for some 
pictures. I may eventually become blind, given the number of 
flashes I have had to see in my life. Well, that is the price of 
fame. Whom do I have to thank for that fame? The Yankees. 
[laughter, applause] 
  While in South Africa, while in South Africa, [repeats 
himself] we attended a luncheon and many people, a lot of 
people, came over to greet us. I got up with pleasure and 
greeted all of them. That day I was really hungry; it was not so 
late, but there is seldom time to eat during these trips, but it 
was useless. I was not able to taste anything while I was there. 
I had to sign autographs and pose for pictures with many of the 
political leaders who went there. 
  The Americans were not far away. They do not like that. 
This administration is resigned to it, however. They take it in 
stride. The Bush and Reagan administrations would get furious 
when I went somewhere and was treated well. They got the image 
they worked at. It bothers them beyond measure that there are 
people in every corner of the world who are kind and hospitable. 
A reporter came by and asked me why kings, princes -- I do not 
recall how many other things he added -- come to greet me. I 
answered: Let me tell you; it is thanks to the Americans. I did 
not say Yankees because there are times when one has to be 
courteous [laughter]. He laughed and went straight to the 
Americans to tell the vice president right away. Some people saw 
him. 
  The Americans who went to the presidential inauguration in 
South Africa behaved mostly courteously; several of them came by 
to greet us. The climate is different. Undoubtedly, there was 
great affection from the ANC and the South African people. They 
reminded us, since it was not our place to remind them, of the 
significance of the Cuito Cuanavale battle, the significance of 
our cooperation with the Angolan people. A country as small as 
Cuba deployed up to 50,000 soldiers. We helped them battle the 
South African aggression. The results of those combats were 
decisive in accelerating the process of the end of apartheid. 
[applause] The South Africans were all saying it. They were 
coming by and stating it with much love and affection. 
  That is how it happened. Even the U.S. media acknowledged 
it. 
I was not seeking that. They might make an official resign for 
taking his picture with me. Several did however, and some of 
them are high up. They approached and greeted me. I said to one: 
I congratulate you; you are courageous. He asked me why. I 
replied: Because you had the courage to come and greet me. Do 
you know what he did? About five minutes later he came back with 
more photographers and said: Let us have our picture taken 
again, to make sure. It was a very courageous gesture. [laughter] 
  There are bitter moments, hard work, threats, all those 
things, but there is also the tremendous inspiration of knowing 
there are so many noble people in the world, so many generous 
people, so many people who do not let others fool them, so many 
people who do allow others to manipulate their brains as is done 
with a child, and people who recognize the effort -- not my 
personal efforts -- none of us is anything without the people, 
none of us is anything without the effort and sacrifice of the 
millions of people who struggled and made the Revolution 
possible, who have supported it, and who are defending it. I am 
aware that it is our people and their efforts and sacrifices to 
whom the many noble people in the world wish to express 
recognition, affection, and support. I have seen it here among 
you in particular. I have seen in this hospitable, warm land, 
where we have felt great encouragement because the fight -- and 
we have been fighting and waging a very difficult battle for 
many years -- requires encouragement. This encouragement 
sustains us, we live on this encouragement. This is why we 
appreciate, with much fervor and affection, the deep solidarity 
and support you have provided during these difficult times. 
These are among the most difficult times we have experienced, in 
a struggle against the blockade, a struggle against a 
restrengthened blockade, a struggle against the efforts of our 
mighty neighbors to the north to make us surrender by hunger, to 
force us to give up, and to force us to our knees. Yet, we will 
cut off our legs rather than bow our heads. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Using Marti's words: In the world, 
there are more flowers than snakes. You can be assured that here 
you will always find a garden to support the dignity of the 
Cuban people. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel, accept my salute of 
sincere friendship and boundless and disinterested solidarity 
from this group, as well as all the solidarity groups working 
jointly today throughout Colombia. We want you to know that we 
are increasing our efforts and thoughts that you may remain, 
with the same physical and spiritual integrity, at the helm of 
your people for the good of the Third World community. Thank 
you. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] I am also carrying a gift, a sign of 
affection for our beloved commander. [applause, laughter] 
  [Unidentified speaker] From the city of Barranquilla -- 100 
km from Cartagena -- a delegation has come to express to you the 
love of the Colombian people and the deep admiration we all feel 
for the great political and social work that you have carried 
out, not only on behalf of the Cuban people, but also on behalf 
of all the peoples of the world, who see in you and in Marti's 
people, the best example of dignity in history. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel Castro, comrades 
from Cuba and Colombia: The Cartagena University Professionals 
Club is honored and proud to have in its midst a man of the 
historic stature of Fidel Castro. It had always been our dream 
to meet, greet, and listen to the dialectic and depth of his 
oratory, and his characteristic wit. We feel truly happy to have 
with us this hero who we so highly revere and whose good works 
we have seen. 
  My dear friends, I dare guarantee that we are privileged to 
have here, in front of our eyes, such a great man, who is, I 
believe, after Simon Bolivar, the greatest in history. [applause] 
  I want to point out this historic moment, not only for 
Cartagena, but also for the Professionals Club. I am going to 
ask our illustrious commander to do us the favor of writing his 
name on this wall because from today on, this hall will be 
named: Fidel Castro's. [applause, crowd chants: Fidel! Fidel! 
Fidel! Viva Commander Fidel Castro! Viva! Down with the Yankee 
blockade! Down!] 
  [Unidentified speaker] On behalf of the youth present here 
who represent a Solidarity with Cuba committee, we wish to 
present this humble banner to you, Commander. The banner reads: 
Thanks, Commander, for making so much dignity possible. 
[applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] On behalf of the friends of Cuba in 
Cali, who are very numerous, I have the deep honor of relaying 
the deepest message of solidarity to the commander in chief, and 
to tell him that Cali, in the most humble and simple manner, 
support the entire epic of the Cuban people because we know that 
the Cuban epic is our epic, the epic of mankind that struggles 
with hope and struggles to live in a better world. 
  I would also like to respectfully ask your opinion on the 
path the Colombian solidarity campaigns, and possibly Latin 
American campaigns, ought to take. We would like to hear what is 
the most appropriate form that the expressions of solidarity 
ought to take at this time. Thank you. [applause] 
  [Castro] We are truly waging a war for our survival in light 
of our northern neighbor's attempt to force our surrender by 
starving, choking, drowning, and crushing us. Our neighbor also 
tries to isolate us. What you are doing is waging a battle 
against isolation. What are you doing is waging a battle against 
the blockade. You have spontaneously understood and seen that 
for us, this is main path of the struggle right now to resist 
the efforts of the most powerful nation in the world, which 
today rules unchallenged. This fulfills what Bolivar and Marti 
prophesied could happen in this hemisphere. This is what is 
taking place practically worldwide. We could say that we are 
involved in that Biblical struggle, the struggle of David and 
Goliath. We need support because this battle has to be won 
morally and politically. Above all, by winning the moral battle, 
one wins everything. 
  I already told you about what happened in South Africa. I 
believe that impressed the U.S. observers at the summit. I have 
really not mentioned this much because I do not want them to 
conduct a witch hunt against those people who came to greet me. 
I see that this relates to the same thing. If they see that in 
spite of the deluge of campaigns, calumnies, and lies against 
Cuba... [pauses] What has fallen upon our small country, upon 
our people, and upon our struggle is a true deluge, greater even 
than the Biblical deluge. Yet, this deluge has not been able to 
fool everyone. It has not been able to prevent the fact that in 
so many parts of the world, through instinct and out of an 
elementary sense of direction that each human being has, only 
some of the people can be fooled. There are many who cannot be 
fooled, however. Thus, we have people who react the way you do. 
  This encourages us and truly gives us hope. As I said, that 
is what we need, that is our strength, that is our lifeline. We 
are overwhelmed with emotion by what you have done and by what 
you do today. We could not imagine anything more affectionate, 
hospitable, and noble. You cannot imagine the power that this 
has. That enormous wall must be destroyed with this. 
  I too studied the Bible because I studied in Jesuit schools. 
I spent about 12 years studying at La Salle school. I had to 
study the Bible every year. I cannot forget the story of the 
walls of Jericho. The story goes that at the end, with trumpets 
-- I believe it was Joshua -- some of you may be more up to date 
on this. It was Joshua, right? The story is that with trumpets 
they destroyed the walls. I say that men and women like you 
around the world will destroy the modern walls of this gigantic 
Jericho, which today attempts to defeat and crush Cuba, the 
Cuban Revolution, and Cuba's independence, and tries to destroy 
the brotherhood and unity among all our peoples. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Fidel, our children know you. They 
love you and they love Cuba, and we love our Cuban children. 
[applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] Fidel, all of us in this room, or the 
majority of us here have lived the Cuban Revolution. We have 
seen the new man that comes from Cuba. We have witnessed the 
commander who did put aside war to talk about fraternity and 
awareness, that you come to a meeting or summit and say that you 
can perceive the will of noble people, and the men who truly 
want the new being of Cuba to become the new man of Latin 
America. 
  I believe it is important that this disparagement be 
overcome. I believe North America has a reality, a terrible and 
inhumane reality, where Latin people are starving, where some 
live way above others, where an underworld exists, and that 
underworld of savage capitalism must disappear. I believe we 
must demonstrate that truth. Just as the Cubans in Miami 
demonstrate superfluous glory, it is important to demonstrate 
how this superfluous glory destroys many lives and kills many 
people through starvation. [applause] 
  [Unidentified speaker] I have seen the newscasts on 
television, and they keep saying that you have changed your 
attire for a guayabera. If you have always dressed in your 
uniform, why change now? [laughter] 
  [Castro] My dear, I am going to tell you what happened. I 
was 
told that they had requested all visitors to wear guayaberas or 
regular shirts. All they had to say was that it was so hot, and 
we would have brought t-shirts or no shirts at all. 
  As you can see, I had a problem because I have my old 
habits. 
I said to myself: What should I do about my hosts? Before, 
everyone would attend the summits in business suits. I attended 
those summits in my usual outfit. As a matter of fact, one 
reporter once asked me about my outfit and I told him those were 
the outfits I wore when I was in the mountains. I like them, 
these are my outfits; they are very comfortable. I do not have 
to keep up with the fads, changing the cut or the design. It is 
very inexpensive. 
  I also have a dress suit. I call it that not because it has 
too many ornaments or anything else, but because it is a 
suitcoat, a tie, and slacks. It is a suitcoat unlike the one I 
wear everyday to work, and sometimes I attend ceremonies in that 
if I do not have time to put the other suit on. 
  I know that some criticized me. Some began to make up 
stories. Not everybody, but some would say that I was the only 
one who attended the summits in a uniform. It seems that they 
wanted to associate the idea of my uniform with a who-knows-what 
idea or experience that they may have had in their countries, or 
perhaps wanted to portray me as a militarist or something to 
that effect. 
  I have received no increase in rank, however. I have the 
same 
rank I had when I disembarked from the Granma. [applause] I was 
commander because there were lieutenants, captains, and 
commanders. There were three captains, one commander, and 
several lieutenants. That is all there was. I remained 
commander. I was the only one who was not promoted. But I was 
commander in chief... [pauses] I retained that title and rank. 
We fought the war and we won. We fought in the Bay of Pigs; we 
fought in many places to carry out important internationalist 
missions. Many people have received rank. There came a point 
when our forces were so big that just with the three ranks, it 
was impossible to keep up. 
  But I always felt love for the rank I held, which was my 
first rank, and I always dressed in the uniform. 
  There are exceptions. I can assure you that I do not sleep 
in 
my uniform. [laughter] Every once in a while I will wear pajamas 
or something similar. If I go to the beach, something I like 
very much, I do not go swimming or scuba diving in my uniform. 
[laughter] Instead I wear shorts and practice my sports 
activities. 
  But there was a history and tradition. The request was for a 
shirt or guayabera. It would not have been appropriate for me to 
be in uniform while the others were in shirts. I thought to 
myself: Which one of the two will I wear? The one I call the 
formal suit would not be appropriate. I thought: Should I wear 
my daily uniform? They would have begun talking about the 
uniform. I believe I had not worn a guayabera since I was a 
student. That was not too long ago [laughter], but it was some 
time ago. Then I decided to demonstrate that I was not afraid of 
wearing a guayabera. 
  There are some who have said that I wear a bullet-proof 
vest. The only bullet-proof vest I wear are my morals. 
[applause] When you can keep your head high and your conscience 
clean, then you... [pauses] When you challenge the enemy, it is 
just like lions do. You have seen the lion trainers in the 
circus with the whip. Later, he turns his back on the lion and 
the lion remains calm. Sometimes I must turn my back on the lion 
and I am at ease. 
  The enemy is always making plans. I more or less hinted at 
that before. I am talking about assassination plots everywhere I 
go. There are many groups that know they have impunity to do 
this, to organize all types of plans. 
  Some were concerned. The comrades in charge of security were 
worried about the carriage ride. They were worried about this 
because it was 40 minutes among buildings, and with a horse that 
would walk slowly. Our horse actually had a bad temper. 
[laughter] We almost had an accident. It crashed into the 
carriage ahead of us. I believe I was in the third carriage and 
our horse ran into the carriage in front of us. 
  They almost convinced me because one should not argue with 
the people in charge of security. One must listen to them and 
negotiate with them. They had arrived at the conclusion that I 
should not participate in the carriage ride. They had me almost 
convinced. I was looking at the paintings at the Naval museum, 
but I felt uneasy. I finally told the comrades, I am going for 
the carriage ride. I told them that it was very difficult for me 
to play the role of a coward. I do not want anyone to say that I 
came here to Barranquilla and did not take a carriage ride. 
  [Crowd interrupting] Cartagena! 
  [Castro] That is right. I came to Cartagena representing 
Barranquilla and all of Colombia [applause] that I came to 
Cartagena and did not ride in the carriage. Then it occurred to 
me: Who will I invite? [laughter] It occurred to me that I would 
invite Gabo [Gabriel Garcia Marquez]. I said to him: Gabo, I 
invite you to come with me. [laughter] I am a bad friend. 
[laughter] Climb aboard with me. [chuckles] I told Mercedes 
Garcia Marquez: Mercedes, do not worry, if you are going to be 
widowed, it is better that you become widowed while you are 
still young. [laughter] So, there is no problem. [chuckles] I 
took Gabo with me and we went for the ride and it was fantastic. 
  That is how it is. So that is why I wore the guayabera. The 
nice thing about the guayabera is that everyone praised it. 
[applause] I did not even know how this guayabera would turn out 
because I did not know how this beard would look with a white 
guayabera. Well, I finally made the decision to wear the 
guayabera and I must say I liked it. [laughter] 
  I still have not decided if I am going to take the plane in 
the guayabera and change while I am in the airplane, or if I 
will arrive in Havana in guayabera. [applause] 
  These are the reasons, but no, I will return to my uniform. 
  [Unidentified speaker] This poetry book reads: To Fidel, 
father. [applause] 
  [Castro] The first thing I wanted to say is that I 
congratulate Cartagena, I congratulate all of Colombia for 
hosting the Fourth Latin American Summit. It would be hard to 
find a more hospitable and beautiful city for this task. I would 
like to say that not all that is desired is attained in these 
summits. These summits have the singificance of being the first 
time, almost, in Latin American history that we have met on our 
own without having others summon us. It is the fourth time. 
[applause] 
  If we speak of integration and unity, we must begin by 
meeting. Not every head of state has exactly the same views and 
the number of political ideas are very heterogeneous. The mere 
fact of meeting to discuss issues of mutual interest always 
means getting closer; leaders get to know one another. It is a 
first step, an important first step. It is so important that our 
northern neighbors felt envious; they were worried, and invented 
a summit there, of all places, in Miami. [Crowd: Down with the 
Miami summit!] 
  If they invite me, I will calmly go. [laughter] But they 
have already said not to think or even dream about it. They have 
truly committed an act of cowardice. They did not want me there. 
They are afraid of ideas, of words. [applause] They are afraid 
of the truth, and chose Miami on the basis of domestic politics 
-- that is the truth. It is an important state because there is 
a group, not a majority, but they are the ones that make more 
noise. They have more resources. They have lobbies. They have 
representatives in Congress and make great efforts so the 
blockade against Cuba is strengthened, for greater hostility and 
threats against Cuba. 
  They exert enormous pressure and the U.S. Government takes 
this pressure into consideration, thinking about the next 
election, when in fact many members of that community are 
economic emigres, just like there are millions of Colombian, 
Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Mexican economic emigres. That is 
why they are building a wall that is higher than the Berlin 
Wall, to prevent the Mexicans from crossing over. All the 
technical means possible are used to stop them. Well, many of 
these people are economic emigres and they oppose the blockade 
and aggression. 
  You have no idea how they treated the representatives of the 
Cuban communities in the Miami area and throughout the United 
States when they went to a meeting in Cuba. They were treated 
with fascist methods, truly fascist methods. Those people are 
full of hate and the desire for revenge. [Words indistinct] what 
part of the country each one gets. That is how they think about 
our country; those are the people who want to own the country. 
That is why we were not invited to the summit -- quite the 
contrary. 
  I said: It does not matter if we do not go. The important 
thing is what will be done and what will be demanded at the 
summit because there are many things to demand there, 
face-to-face. They have the opportunity to tell it like it is. I 
hope that at least a few of them decide to tell it like it is 
and make demands and defend the interests of Latin America and 
the Caribbean. That summit, however, is a result of this one, 
and this one must be defended. Once there was talk of holding 
these summits every two years. No, every year. This is 
important, very important. It represents a big step forward and 
I think that the fact that it was held in this city and with 
great success truly represents a source of pride. Efforts were 
exerted so the summit would be a brilliant event. If the program 
is too long, however, sometimes... [pauses] They wanted to do so 
much for their visitors that there was practically no time for 
everything, but the cordial, warm attitude of the people, the 
city's authorities, and everyone was evident. I want to use this 
opportunity to congratulate you. I hope this summit becomes part 
of our history. 
  I am also deeply touched to hear, like I heard here, that 
people have come from faraway places. They had to travel 
hundreds of km. People have come here even from Cali. I think a 
bus or two buses brought them. Others came from Santa Fe de 
Bogota and other places. They had to make great sacrifices to do 
so. In my opinion, this increases the importance of this 
meeting, of this event. In my eyes, this increases the noble, 
generous, supportive, human character of the Colombians. In my 
eyes, it heightens the pride of being part of this Latin 
American family. 
  We will be united one day. We will not have the right to 
mention Simon Bolivar's name and Jose Marti's name with honor 
until we are a truly united Latin America like they dreamed; so 
we are a force to be reckoned with; so we have a place in the 
world; so we are respected by others; so we do not become a 
balkanized continent, an easy victim of those who have always 
wanted to seize control, an easy victim of those who want to 
plunder us. We have the same language, a privilege Europe does 
not have -- yet Europe is uniting to survive. What kind of 
future do we have, divided in a thousand pieces, if there are 
great economic and political powers? We have the same culture, 
which is something the Europeans do not have; we have the same 
language, which is something they do not have; we have the same 
origins, which is something they do not have. 
  What a vision Bolivar had back then! He thought about this 
when there were no roads, trains, airplanes, communications, 
telephones like this one. What are they called? [people answer: 
"Cellular telephones."] Cellular telephones and all these things 
that allow you to contact Patagonia in a minute. Bolivar rode a 
horse, he travelled by horse, yet he dreamed about uniting this 
hemisphere. We must be capable of uniting in modern times, with 
all the means of communication we have. One feels pride that our 
brothers are people like you and people like the Bolivians, 
Peruvians, Brazilians, and the Central Americans, because the 
people are everywhere, like an immense mine. The conquerors 
looked for gold all over the place -- tens of millions of 
Indians died when they were forced to look for gold -- yet they 
did not know that the heart of only one of the hundreds of 
millions of Latin Americans contains more gold than all the gold 
that existed in the heart of this hemisphere! [applause] I 
perceive this wealth in our people; I perceive their 
intelligence; I perceive their ability, and I know we have the 
right to a future and we will conquer that future. 
  Together we wage a battle today -- you and I, you and our 
people -- so our homeland may survive, so the revolution may 
survive. That trench must never fall into the hands of the 
powerful empire [applause] because it would become another 
weapon to seize control. The day before he died, Marti said 
everything he had done so far for Cuba's independence was to 
prevent the United States from extending its dominance over 
American lands. We are fulfilling the most sacred precepts of 
our predecessors and those who started this long process. Time 
will not defeat us ever, and someday we will be the strong, 
indestructible nation they dreamed about. You are the best proof 
of this. Thank you, a thousand times thank you! [applause] If 
they tell you our plane could not take off, it would be for one 
reason -- the enormous cargo of emotions and gratitude we take 
with us after meeting with you! [applause]

<F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Samper from the "Evening Information </F>
Review" newscast] 
  [Text] At the latest working day of the second round table 
held with the Cuban Government, which was organized by the 
British financial magazine THE ECONOMIST, Cuban Foreign 
Relations Minister Roberto Robaina explained the island's 
foreign policies and other immigration and blockade issues. 
Questioned by the media, Robaina said this type of meeting is 
held only when a country inspires confidence and security for 
businessmen, who have realized there are true investment 
opportunities here. Due to Cuba's proximity to Caribbean Basin 
countries, Robaina commented on Caribbean ties. 
  [Begin recording] [Robaina] Fortunately, we are climbing a 
path toward normalizing and broadening relations, and we are 
about to make a very important decision for the Caribbean and 
Cuba, which not only receives from the Caribbean, but -- to be 
modest -- also has many things to offer to the Caribbean. We 
are about to create the Caribbean States Association, thereby 
taking one important and valid step toward joining the process 
to participate in the world economy. 
  [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] and Cuba and the 
United States could become trade partners in view of the first 
[words indistinct] 
  [Robaina] I do not believe in establishing normal relations 
with the United States. We have a document listing those 
countries that were with us when we were being besieged. Those 
countries that helped us when we were being blockaded will 
continue to play a special role. As for establishing relations 
with the United States, it may or may not happen; it may come or 
it may not. To us, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada 
will always be Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada, because 
they supported us first. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] 
  [Robaina] We will not negotiate the establishment of 
diplomatic relations. These are things that go without saying; 
they go without saying insofar as the process to establish 
relations advances. We can say that we maintain diplomatic 
relations with China and Belize and that we have contacts with 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Establishing 
ties, however, is not part of our plans. We do not want anyone 
to feel pressured by Cuba, which maintains relations with 147 
countries. I believe that should we talk about isolation, we 
would be the most supported isolated nation. 
  [Reporter] As for last week's OAS meeting held in Belem, 
Brazil, how do you view Cuba's role within the OAS? How do you 
view Cuba's rejoining the OAS? What are the steps you think 
Cuba will take in the near future? 
  [Robaina] As far as Cuba is concerned, we will not take any 
steps. Being part of an organization that expelled us is not 
one of our priorities. I believe it is the OAS that must decide 
whether the conditions to amend an unfair decision have already 
been met. I believe the OAS will have to make a decision; only 
then will we issue our opinion. We have much more important 
priorities than joining the OAS. 
  [Reporter] As for the U.S. blockade on Cuba, when do you 
believe it will be lifted? 
  [Robaina] I believe this is an important question because 
our 
front-door neighbors are the ones blockading us. You will have 
to ask the same question to the United States with as much 
fervor as you are asking me now. I believe, however, that 
sooner or later the U.S. blockade will be lifted; this is a 
situation that cannot go on forever, but we do not expect the 
blockade to be lifted sooner rather than later. I believe the 
U.S. Government is still refusing to lift it. For the first 
time, however, public opinion and U.S. businessmen and 
businesswomen are beginning to reject this policy because Cuba 
is not the only one that is blockaded; they are as blockaded as 
we are. In the country of freedom, they cannot visit Cuba; in 
the country of freedom, they cannot invest here. In other 
words, we Cubans are blockaded, and so are they. 
  [Reporter] Can Cuba survive five more years of U.S. 
blockade? 
  [Robaina] We already survived 35 years, and I think that, if 
we survived 35 years under worse conditions, then five more 
years is nothing. If you ask me, however, I do not want this to 
happen; but we are willing to accept it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Pedro </F>
Vinas Alfonso; place and date not given; first three paragraphs 
are BOHEMIA introduction] 
  [Text] A few weeks after Roberto Robaina was named minister 
of foreign relations, BOHEMIA's international department 
requested an interview, which he felt was premature at that 
time. We understood, and suggested that we wait for 12 months 
and then conduct an extensive interview. 
  Now that a year has elapsed, we can offer our readers what 
may be the most extensive interview the minister has given to 
the Cuban press, in which he answers a variety of substantive 
questions on Cuba and its place in a world that has changed 
dramatically in the last five years. 
  Our readers will receive a report with a gestation period of 
a year. To some extent, it is a report on the performance by the 
head of Cuban diplomacy during this time. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] There has been persistent talk of a strong 
diplomatic offensive since you became foreign minister. Is that 
true? 
  [Robaina] People should instead talk of an ongoing offensive 
by Cuban diplomacy in the last 35 years. A tremendous diplomatic 
battle was waged by Roa in the United Nations in April 1961, 
while in another -- though not precisely international -- arena 
our forces repelled the mercenaries' attack at the Bay of Pigs. 
That has been our style since 1959: exterior work based on what 
we Cubans are doing inside our country. Our foreign minister's 
diplomatic arguments were so solid because our people were at 
that very time defending their destiny on the battlefield. 
  Now we have again come to a crucial moment in the history of 
the revolution, when not only is the sovereignty of our nation 
at stake, but also the very existence of the nation. Our 
diplomacy must be capable of meeting the challenge of today's 
circumstances, and that requires giving a new impetus to this 
offensive. I do not believe it has so much to do with who is in 
charge of this work, but instead with the pace that the new 
times impose. 
  I maintain that those of us who have the duty of explaining 
abroad what is happening in Cuba face a task that is 
incomparably less difficult than the effort a housewife makes 
every day in her kitchen, or a worker expends in reaching his 
workplace early. At the same time, it is a tremendous challenge 
to give the world a true image of Cuba, as we are surrounded by 
a powerful information monopoly as unipolar as the world in 
which we live. 
  That is what we are doing now, and we certainly talk of a 
diplomatic offensive, which we need now: special diplomacy for a 
special period. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] What are Cuba's foreign policy priorities 
now? 
  [Robaina] Since last year we have established a minimal 
number of priorities, so we will know exactly where to focus our 
work. 
  In the very first place is our legitimate struggle against 
the U.S. embargo, the growing effort by the international 
community to condemn this embargo, and taking steps to 
neutralize the negative effects of that policy of economic 
isolation. 
  The dissemination of our real image around the world, with 
strengths and weaknesses, but a real image as I have explained, 
is another of our priorities. The great information 
multinationals have for a long time distorted the Cuban reality, 
which was been a way of justifying to international public 
opinion specific political actions taken against Cuba. With our 
modest resources we must, and we can, every day subvert this 
situation. The famous human rights issue is one of the most 
extensively manipulated enemy campaigns, and as we honor the 
truth, we will not remain seated on the bench of the accused 
when the greatest violator is trying to serve as our judge. 
  Other priorities are working to develop economic relations 
abroad; working for the true democratization of the United 
Nations and of international relations; our growing ties with 
the countries of our continent, and specifically with the 
Caribbean nations; and becoming more active in regional 
organizations. Finally, we work constantly to strengthen the 
solidarity movement with Cuba. 
  It is easy to realize that our goals are not so great as 
everything we need to do to achieve them. Time will have the 
last word. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Does Cuba have a presence in Africa now? 
What 
are the prospects for our relationship with the "Dark Continent"? 
  [Robaina] I can categorically answer yes to that question; 
we 
do maintain a presence in Africa, and we could not do otherwise. 
Cuba shares with the African countries, in addition to our 
strong ties of blood and a similar culture and habits, the fact 
that we belong to the underdeveloped world, so we need to work 
together to emerge from underdevelopment; this is obviously 
related to our combat against the present manifestations of 
colonialism, neocolonialism, and racism. 
  Our presence in Africa is shown by our 16 embassies and 
several hundred Cubans who work in various fields, primarily 
health care, as well as in education, sports, and other areas of 
economic, scientific, technical, and cultural activity. This is 
all a consequence of the numerous bilateral accords we have 
signed, and of our participation in multilateral cooperation 
organizations. 
  In addition, despite the enormous limitations imposed by the 
special period, Cuba continues to provide Africa with 
extraordinary support, like the training we provide to mid- and 
upper-level technicians and professionals in all fields, who 
later will contribute to the development of their own countries. 
Africans make up almost two-thirds of the foreign scholarship 
students studying in our country. 
  In our relationship with Africa, we certainly intend to 
continue developing these ties that which benefit us both 
bilaterally, and the Third World as a whole. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Can we now discuss the integration of our 
country with the rest of the Caribbean nations, or is that an 
objective? 
  [Robaina] I do not think we can talk about integration. 
Integration as such has not been achieved in the region. Nor of 
integration as an objective. Instead, I believe this is a 
process that in recent years has taken on great momentum. Do not 
forget that in the 1970's we began to develop cooperation plans 
for sectors like health care and education with other Caribbean 
countries. 
  During our trip to the seven English-speaking Caribbean 
states with which we have diplomatic relations, one of the 
constants was their governments' gratitude for the aid Cuba has 
provided for years in education and health care. Just in 
university education, during these years we have graduated over 
600 students from that region. The contribution made by Cuban 
medical brigades to Caribbean countries like Guyana and Belize 
is widely recognized. And this is also part of the integration 
process I was talking to you about. 
  One of the main steps taken recently is the creation of the 
Joint Cuba-Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] Commission, which 
should promote cooperation and relations with the 13 
English-speaking Caribbean nations of the Caribbean Community, 
in specific sectors such as biotechnology, fishing, agriculture, 
culture, information, and other areas. 
  In this move toward regional integration, the projected 
Association of Caribbean States should play a very important 
role. This is expected to become a reality in 1994, and Cuba 
should be a full member of this association. 
  As you see, this process is going at a good pace, and it 
really does have great prospects. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] What might be the future of Latin America if 
the FTA [Free Trade Association] were to be extended to the 
entire continent? If that happened, what would happen to our 
insistence on regional integration? 
  [Robaina] Free trade has become a trend of our times, 
especially in our hemisphere, after the formation of large 
economic blocs in Europe, Asia, and North America. 
  In addition to the recent FTA, there are in our continent 
Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Group of Three 
(Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Andean Pact, Caricom, and 
SIECA [Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration], 
all of which are moving toward establishing free trade systems 
among our countries. 
  Brazil's government recently proposed creating a Free Trade 
Zone for South America, and its intention to extend this to 
other geographic areas of Latin America. Cuba is watching the 
evolution and execution of all these mechanisms. 
  It would take a long time for the FTA (known by its English 
acronym, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]) to be 
extended all over the continent, and many difficulties would 
need to be overcome. One difficulty is that the United States 
would have to be really prepared to eliminate all impediments in 
its trade with our region, and treat us as equals. This would 
primarily mean that they would need to take into account the 
differences existing between that country and our peoples. 
  Cuba also supports free trade. Because of our geographic 
position and the development of our economy, we have always been 
open to integration mechanisms. 
  However, the embargo the United States maintains against 
Cuba 
is an obstacle, and one of the contradictions of those who 
proclaim free trade as a philosophy, while at the same time they 
maintain this embargo, apply pressure, and prevent Cuba from 
exercising this right. 
  If we now moved toward a "fast track" implementation of the 
FTA on a hemispheric level, our Latin American countries would 
have to negotiate separately in bilateral dealings with the 
United States, which would obviously be a great advantage for 
the United States. 
  At the next Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, 
one 
issue on the agenda will be integration. Cuba will state its 
position, which may be summarized like this: before reaching a 
hemispheric Free Trade Agreement, we should go through a process 
of strictly Latin American integration, which will enable us to 
talk with the United States from stronger positions. There is 
still a long road to travel before arriving at a continental FTA. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Where are our relations with the European 
Union? 
  [Robaina] At a point where we perceive new prospects for 
cooperation. 
  Starting in 1993, a gradual and encouraging change has begun 
in Cuban-European relations. An example of this is the aid sent 
after the "hurricane of the century" and the neuropathy 
epidemic, aid for which all our people are grateful. Another 
example is the European Union's rejection of the 
extraterritorial nature of the Torricelli Amendment and the 
European Parliament's condemnation of the U.S. embargo against 
Cuba. 
  The seminar held in Havana last December demonstrated that 
it 
is possible to talk in a climate of respect and that there is 
consensus on continuing to develop bilateral relations. 
  I am sure we will move ahead in that direction. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] In Cuba's case, does Spain fully play its 
historic role as the representative of Hispanic America in the 
European Union? 
  [Robaina] I really think you should ask Spain that question. 
  That said, let me point out that, in fact, Spain has 
historically served as the bridge between Latin America and the 
European Economic Community (now the European Union), and it has 
worked to defend the interests of the continent, which Cuba 
looks upon with favor. 
  In the bilateral area, we have very extensive relations with 
Spain in all sectors, and we would like them to continue and 
expand. This is appropriate because of the strong solidarity, 
affection, and shared identity between the peoples of Spain and 
Cuba. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] What about our relations with the former 
socialist nations? 
  [Robaina] After a period of adjustment and even a 
considerable decline in ties of all sorts as a consequence of 
the changes in the countries of East Europe, relations are 
entering a new phase of normalization and a search for ties 
which may be of mutual benefit for our peoples. 
  Of course, the economic ties have been considerably 
affected, 
not because of a political decision on either side, but rather 
because of the lack of real possibilities for fluid trade. 
Nevertheless, there are other channels for cooperation, and we 
are working on that. The relations we have developed for over 30 
years cannot and must not disappear overnight. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Can you tell us about ties with the new 
republics in the former USSR, especially with Russia and Ukraine? 
  [Robaina] Bilateral relations with those countries, which 
after the dismembering of the USSR were at an impasse, have 
begun to revive and we now see fluid exchanges in both 
directions. 
  Cuba maintains relations with the majority of the states 
that 
were part of the former USSR. We have ambassadors accredited to 
the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Latvia, and we also are 
represented in Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus, and Estonia. 
  With the Russian Federation the most difficult moment in 
bilateral relations is now behind us. People have become aware 
of the potential that exists, and there is an obvious desire to 
restore exchanges and active cooperation in various areas on 
mutually advantageous terms. 
  With Ukraine relations are proceeding normally; we want to 
renew the legal basis of these relations and begin a new phase 
in trade. Recently the Embassy of Ukraine was officially opened 
in Havana, and in general we maintain a fluid interchange in 
political matters. The Ukrainian Government recently approved a 
significant amount of humanitarian aid for Cuba, which we will 
receive shortly. 
  In a general sense, our relations with these new states have 
a tradition of over 30 years that unites us with their peoples. 
Now we need to restructure our ties on new foundations, based on 
the changing situation in today's world. 
  At the end of last year we were working on some new 
agreements that have still not been fully executed, but we are 
confident that the situation of relative stagnation that at one 
moment threatened our fraternal trade ties has been overcome to 
our mutual benefit. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] The "Nation and Emigration" conference will 
soon take place. How might that help to promote a change in the 
now old and stale hostility between Washington and Havana? 
  [Robaina] In the first place, let me make it clear that the 
old conflict between Cuba and the United States is not on the 
agenda of this conference. As it has been said, this is a 
meeting of Cubans who live in over 50 countries all over the 
world. The issues to be discussed concern only that 
nation-emigres relationship. 
  Moreover, it is no secret to anyone that the largest number 
of Cuban emigres live in the United States, as it is also no 
secret to anyone that for 35 years that emigration has been used 
by the aggressive policy of that country against Cuba. In the 
same way, I am not saying anything new when I say that in recent 
times a large part of that emigre community is changing in terms 
of their relationship toward the island and their positions on 
U.S. policy toward Cuba. Obviously, all this is the context of 
Cuba's relations with the emigre community, and it would be 
impossible to avoid touching on this situation during the 
conference. 
  Cuba's relations with the United States will definitely not 
be promoted at that conference. I will reaffirm once again our 
readiness to discuss the issue directly with that government, 
without intermediaries and at any time, but in a climate of 
mutual respect, equality of conditions, and without any 
preconditions or pressure. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Will this meeting be the start of an ongoing 
exchange? How does it benefit Cubans both here and abroad? 
  [Robaina] Contacts with our emigres throughout the world 
have 
always existed, with some more, with others less, but those 
contacts have been maintained. Though to be honest, relations 
with the Cuban community living in the United States have been, 
as I explained, for a long time tainted by the conflict between 
the two countries. 
  Working to normalize relations with the emigre community is 
one of the fundamental objectives of the conference. It was 
preceded by the dialogue in 1978, which was certainly an 
important step taken by the Cuban Government, by means of which 
effective answers were given to specific problems affecting 
Cuban emigres. 
  The forthcoming conference in Havana will provide a followup 
to that first meeting and solve new problems in the 
emigre-nation relationship. Cubans on the island who have 
relatives abroad and those in that emigre community who want to 
maintain normal ties with Cuba and their families will both 
benefit. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] In Miami some spokespersons on the far right 
are saying that the conference is trying to divide the emigre 
community. What do you think? 
  [Robaina] The fact that they are "spokespersons on the far 
right" confirms what I already said, that every day that emigre 
community is more divided about how to handle their relationship 
with Cuba. So it cannot be an objective of the conference to 
trigger a process that has already begun on its own. 
  Obviously, there are different ways of viewing that 
emigration, and the presence at the conference of some people 
for and others against will actually be the demonstration of a 
fact, and not its cause. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] At all international forums, Cuba insists on 
the need to end the embargo. Could there be a possibility of 
that happening anytime soon? Might our problems then be 
eliminated? 
  [Robaina] The first is another question that should be 
addressed to the U.S. Congress or the White House. But we are 
not going to give up our right to denounce the criminal, 
antiquated, and ineffective embargo at any forum where a Cuban 
representative is present. 
  And we are working every day to add new forces to the 
already 
overwhelming mass of countries, organizations, and public 
figures all over the world, even in the United States, who speak 
out against that brutal step that violates the principal human 
right of an entire people, the right to life. 
  If one day reason triumphs and the embargo is lifted, I can 
assure you that would eliminate one of our major problems and 
many others that derive from it. But in no way would that be the 
end of our difficulties, which have other well-known causes, and 
against which we are also working every day. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] You have just returned from a trip to Asia. 
What can you tell us about that region, which is both so remote 
and so close? 
  [Robaina] Precisely that. It is worthwhile to travel that 
far, if only to realize that we have very good friends in that 
part of the world, some perhaps, our most loyal friends. 
  The trip included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, 
Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and had more or less the 
same objectives as our former visits to other areas of the world. 
  As always, we brought the truth about Cuba and learned from 
close at hand about others--experiences like those of Vietnam, 
which in some aspects coincide with our own economic 
transformations. There is much that we can, should, and are 
going to apply here. 
  With the governments we talked about issues of mutual 
interest: bilateral and multilateral relations, and the 
Non-Aligned Movement, which is now being chaired by an Asian 
nation, Indonesia. 
  We met with ministers, political leaders, and businessmen, 
and saw the possibilities of exchanges in various areas, 
including economics of course, and we discussed prospects for 
joint investments. 
  Because of the distance separating us, we have to work 
creatively to find the most viable mechanisms to increase our 
exchanges. 
  Finally, I want to say that one of the interesting 
experiences of my visit was seeing how our diplomatic missions 
in those countries, while small and modest, honorably represent 
Cuba and are a true example of how to make up with efficiency 
and intelligence for the lack of personnel or greater resources. 
  [Vinas Alfonso] Your appointment a year ago aroused some 
opposition. What is the situation now? 
  [Robaina] Once again, I am not the person who can best 
answer 
that. But I can tell you what I think now, a year after my 
selection as foreign minister. 
  These have been 12 months filled with a great deal of work 
and learning, of experiences of all types; a year in which I 
have traveled to various parts of the world, to some 30 
countries in all. I have taken part in numerous international 
events and talks with personalities from all over the world. It 
has been a year to adapt, while on the job, to new 
responsibilities, a new workplace, new comrades. The year has 
gone well, and I feel pleased about it, although as I am never 
satisfied, I think a lot more could have been done, and in fact 
that is now the challenge I face for the next 12 months. Let us 
see what will happen then.

  [Text] Approximately 200 U.S. citizens, members of the 
second Freedom to Travel flight, will arrive in Cuba on 23 June 
to visit sites of economic, historic, and social interest. 
These U.S. citizens are exercising their constitutional rights 
to travel anywhere in the world and to reject the blockade 
against Cuba. Freedom to Travel members are challenging a U.S. 
law on visiting Cuba and face a possible 10-year prison term and 
fines of up to $250,000. The first such trip to Havana took 
place in November 1993 and included 165 citizens from over 25 
different U.S. states. This visit is sponsored by the Cuban 
Institute of Friendship with Peoples with the help of the Union 
of Young Communists and the Pablo Milanes Foundation.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Opposition figure Rafael 
Gutirrez Santos protested today the fact that Cuban authorities 
refuse to give him permission to leave Cuba to attend an 
international trade union meeting in Brussels, Belgium. 
Gutirrez Santos, who is 58 years old, is on probation after 
spending eight months in prison for charges of spreading "enemy 
propaganda." His sentence is still pending. 
  The activist showed foreign journalists the invitation sent 
to him by the International Conference of Free Trade Union 
Organizations (CIOSL), which is headquartered in Brussels, to 
participate in a forum on human and labor rights to be held next 
week. 
  The Belgian Government informed CIOSL that it would grant a 
visa to Gutirrez Santos but Cuban authorities have refused to 
renew his passport and to grant him a corresponding departure 
permit, Gutirrez Santos said. 
  Gutirrez Santos was an electromechanical operator in the 
port 
of Havana and a leader of a regional merchant marine union, 
which is affiliated with the Cuban Workers Federation until 1992 
when he was expelled from the union for his opposition 
activities. He was also fired from his job at that time.

  [Text] In Havana, Bert Denker, general manager of the ING 
International Bank in the Netherlands, said the ING Bank chose 
Cuba for its economic activities because it is a country that 
has potential and an appropriate infrastructure for development. 
He said 80 percent of trade with the island consists of basic 
products, and he believes emphasis should be placed on 
investments in areas that generate capital for the country, such 
as exports. He also believes emphasis should be placed on 
production in areas that can substitute for imported products. 
  The general manager of the ING Bank in the Netherlands 
listed 
some of Cuba's assets as: an educational system that guarantees 
a highly skilled work force; huge nickel reserves that can be 
exploited efficiently and at low cost; and an excellent 
reputation in tourist development. 
  Denker is attending the second round table conference with 
the Cuban Government organized by THE ECONOMIST financial 
magazine. The conference, which is being held in Havana, is 
scheduled to last two days.

  [Text] Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, 21 Jun -- Monterrey's Vitro 
Group is planning to make investments in Cuba and is thus 
considering buying a Cuban glass-manufacturing company, 
according to the company's director general, Ernesto Martens 
Rebolledo. 
  The Vitro Group plans to invest $300 million in 1994 to 
modernize and expand its plants' capacity. It is also willing 
to invest in Mexico's telecommunications sector if there are 
attractive projects, Martens Rebolledo added. 
  As for the sale of Cuban companies, Martens Rebolledo 
pointed 
out that the National Foreign Trade Bank [Bancomext] will offer 
Mexican investors the factories' assets, which the Cuban 
Government will use to pay some of its debt to Mexico. In that 
sense, Vitro might sign a purchase agreement with Bancomext in 
the short run and thus extend its presence in international 
markets. Thus far, Monterrey businessmen Mauricio Fernandez, 
Danny Tafich, and Javier Garcia Sepulveda have been heavily 
investing in Cuba through the establishment of the International 
Textile Corporation, which consists of 15 plants which employ 
33,000 Cubans. 
  Meanwhile, Martens Rebolledo noted that Vitro's annual sales 
amount to 10.9 billion new pesos, and its annual exports amount 
to some $500 million. At the end of 1993, Vitro's total assets 
were approximately 17.159 billion new pesos, and its total 
liabilities reached 9.638 billion new pesos. Martens Rebolledo 
emphasized that in the past few years, Vitro has made 
investments in fixed assets amounting to approximately 1 billion 
new pesos a year. In 1992, Vitro invested 1.106 billion, while 
in 1993 it invested 802 million new pesos in this type of 
investment. 
  Since it generates 38,538 jobs, the Vitro Group constitutes 
a 
key source of jobs at the national level. It is worth noting, 
however, that in the past years the economic slowdown adversely 
affected Vitro's operational results. This is reflected in its 
annual sales, which grew by a measly 0.4 percent in 1993, while 
its total assets decreased 1.8 percent in contrast with its 
total liabilities, which increased 1.9 percent. 
  According to its latest annual reports sent to the Mexican 
Stock Exchange, Vitro's staff was reduced 14 percent, while its 
investment in fixed assets were reduced 27 percent. Both 
reductions took place during the 1992-93 period.

  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- An official source 
reported today that Cuban Defense Minister Raul Castro has 
demanded state enterprises practice strict financial discipline 
and that he exhorted "an end to the impunity in light of law 
infringements." 
  The weekly TRABAJADORES also reported the high-ranking 
official praised the economic adjustment plan implemented this 
month on the island and urged a promotion of the "people's 
understanding and support for measures already adopted or to be 
adopted later." 
  The Cuban adjustment program, which the government 
differentiates from other world shock measures, raised prices 
and rates of several selected goods and services and includes a 
possible end to subsidizes of state enterprises, as well as a 
possible income tax system. 
  Raul Castro, Army general and Fidel Castro's younger 
brother, 
presided over a meeting of the Western Army Military Council, 
held here on 18 and 19 June to analyze troops' readiness and 
their participation in agricultural tasks. 
  Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez reported that 
at the meeting, authorities temporarily confiscated, among other 
goods, 162 houses, 232 vehicles, and nine boats from individuals 
accused of illegal enrichment. 
  The "precautionary measures" against these people are 
applied 
based on Decree 149, by which the government is attempting to 
halt growing corruption sparked by the serious economic crisis 
that has prevailed on the island since 1990. 
  The weekly states that following the meeting that permitted 
the military chiefs to submit their reports, Raul Castro praised 
the soldiers' discipline and readiness and "the maintenance of 
more than 7 million weapons owned" by the Western Army. The 
defense minister stressed the Army's progress in the planting 
and harvesting of vegetables, tubers, rice, and beans and the 
breeding of animals for human consumption, and he urged the 
troops to save fuel without losing their fighting capability.

it is a Cuban foreign policy priority to continue denouncing the 
blockade. Robaina told the closing session of the international 
businessmen's conference in Havana, attended by 180 
representatives from more than 20 countries, that Cuba is tired 
of its emigre community being used against it. 
  Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal reported at the end of 
the conference, sponsored by THE ECONOMIST, that Cuba had signed 
several geology and mining contracts, including: 26 prospecting 
contracts; two service contracts; one contract for operating the 
Mantua copper deposits; and two joint prospecting contracts for 
gold, lead, and zinc, among others. 
  Tourism Minister Osmany Cienfuegos told the conference, held 
at Havana's Hotel Nacional, that there are 26 associations with 
foreign tourism companies and that almost 40 more associations 
are in the negotiating process. Finance and Prices Minister 
Jose Luis Rodriguez said the state's budget deficit will be 
reduced 25 percent this year. Jan Delanie, executive president 
of Canada's (Cheeriet, Inc.), stressed that oil prospecting in 
the Bay of Cardenas has been very encouraging so far.

  [Text] The fourth Ibero-American tourism symposium opened 
in Havana on 22 June. Carlos Tades, president of the provincial 
assembly of the people's government in Havana, said at the 
opening ceremony that this event is possible due to the vast 
support provided by the Ibero-American Organization for 
Intermunicipal Cooperation [OICI], which has helped Cuba 
organize many activities. 
  He also pointed out the importance Cuba places on tourism: 
Cuba's tourism revenues for 1993 totaled over $700 million, with 
hopes that this year's revenues will top $900 million. Carlos 
Tades added that the number of tourists is expected to increase 
25 percent. 
  OICI Vice President Miguel Angel Pino said he is pleased 
this 
event is being held in Havana. Pino recalled that the OICI was 
established in Havana 56 years ago, when there were no municipal 
organizations in charge of [words indistinct]. Pino added that 
tourism is an economic phenomena with vast social dimensions 
because it ties countries and helps to promote mutual knowledge 
and unity. Pino urged everyone to work hard so that tourism 
continues to promote peace, prosperity, and international 
respect.

<F P=106> [By Karl Morgenstern] </F>
  [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (DPA) -- The Cuban Airline (Empresa 
Consolidada Cubana de Aviacion) that took over the Compania 
Cubana de Aviacion on 27 June 1961 has been badly affected by 
its Soviet inheritance. 
  While its predecessor operated exclusively with British and 
U.S. airplanes, under Fidel Castro's regime the Cuban airline 
became the Soviet airline industry's best client in the Western 
Hemisphere. But with its once impressive fleet, today the 
airline cannot win any laurels. Because of this, Cubana has 
purchased from Aviaco, a subsidiary of Spain's Iberia Airlines, 
eight used Fokker F-27's for $6 million, and it has allocated 
$1.5 million to train the crews to continue servicing national 
and Caribbean flights. 
  The twin-motor Dutch airplanes are certainly not the most 
recent models, but they are still reliable, and despite their 
age they are easier to maintain than the rest of the old Cubana 
fleet which includes three An-24's, nine An-26's, 12 Il-62's, 
nine Tu-154's, five YAK-40's, and two YAK-42's. 
  Seven Il-62's -- four-turboprop long-range airliners that 
are 
extremely expensive to operate but are able to carry 200 
passengers -- will be refurbished and updated to comply with 
U.S. safety standards, since they will also fly over U.S. 
territory. Of the nine three-turboprop Russian Tu-154's, short- 
and medium-range airliners once preferred by the former GDR 
airline Iterflug, only two are in any condition to fly. 
  The Cuban airline industry is in a deep crisis. The old jet 
airliners are expensive, and there is a shortage of foreign 
exchange and consequently fuel, not to mention the scarcity of 
spare parts for the obsolete Russian airliners. Notwithstanding, 
Cubana continues flying to Europe, Latin America, and Canada to 
bring tourists to Cuba. 
  The country raising the most objections is the United 
States. 
In 1991, when Cubana agreed to a joint venture with the 
Brazilian airline company VARIG to modernize its fleet and 
receive a strong injection of capital, the U.S. veto was more 
powerful. VARIG, in pursuit of its own interests in the United 
States, had to capitulate. 
  Another example: International law allows Cuban long-range 
airplanes that fly to Europe the use of a corridor passing over 
the United States which must be strictly observed. But, as soon 
as the airliners reach New York they have to turn right and head 
toward the Atlantic. Even on all flights to Canada, a country 
with which, much to U.S. annoyance, Cuba has had good relations 
for many years, Cuban airliners have to take a huge detour. 
  Heriberto Prieto, general manager of Cubana Airlines, 
laments: "This is equivalent to one additional hour in flight 
time between Havana and Canada, with its corresponding fuel 
expense." 
  Cuba is looking for a way out of this crisis through 
practical emergency solutions. Its stated aim is to survive. 
The best way is through tourist flights which the company does 
not want to leave entirely in the hands of airlines from Europe 
and Canada, regions that provide the majority of tourists 
visiting Cuba. 
  Therefore, they need airplanes. The first step was taken by 
leasing a DC-10. Recently, Aero-Varadero, a subsidiary of 
Cubana Airlines, is flying an Airbus A-310, also leased, from 
Havana to Frankfurt and Milan on a regular basis, and in the 
future will fly to Madrid and Paris.

  [Text] Recent rains in Guanatanamo Province were not 
entirely detrimental because Guantanamo's reservoirs were filled 
almost to capacity and will be able to guarantee water necessary 
for irrigation beyond this year. Dams, minidams, and other 
hydraulic works in the territory have accumulated 328 million 
cubic meters. Their users were assigned 150 million cubic meters 
for this year, and have used 30 percent. An official said 
precipitation in May left lots of moisture in the soil, so it 
does not matter if there is no rain in the near future. 
  [Begin unidentified official recording] We can state that 
the 
first semester of 1995 has its water guaranteed in the dams. 
[end recording] 
  This is a relief for a province where heavy rainfall is 
followed by long dry periods. For example, following the deluge 
in May, there is hardly any precipitation in June; registered 
rainfall does not even reach the 3-mm mark. Nevertheless, a 
gradual increase in rain is expected by mid-September. 
  [Begin unidentified official recording] That would 
practically fill the reservoirs to capacity by year end. [end 
recording] 
  It is true that the capricious weather had harsh results in 
Guantanamo Province, but every cloud has its silver lining. No 
one will be able to justify his failure to fulfill goals due to 
the lack of water. There is enough water in the reservoirs. It 
is only a matter of using it efficiently.

<F P=106> [Interview with Division General Rigoberto Garcia by Caridad </F>
Carrobello; place and date not given; first two paragraphs are 
BOHEMIA introduction] 
  [Text] Although he is 60 years old, he acts as if he has 
been drinking from the fountain of youth. Maybe the source of 
that miracle water is the over 50,000 troops, most of whom are 
between 18 and 20, in the EJT [Youth Labor Army], which he has 
commanded since 1977. 
  Division General Rigoberto Garcia cannot only take credit 
for 
training these young men, but he has also added more luster to 
the stars on his shoulders by producing 632,000 tons of food for 
the Cuban people, as the EJT tends over 15,000 "caballerias" of 
land planted in crops as important as sugarcane, coffee, 
tobacco, citrus fruits, and a variety of other crops. 
  [Carrobello] Will these officers and soldiers propose a new 
method of agricultural work? (I am addressing this and other 
questions to the man whom some people now call "The General of 
the Fields.") 
  [Garcia] The EJT, founded in 1973, was conceived at first as 
only a support force. They had no permanent presence in the 
areas where they worked. Their constant transfers created 
problems and a great deal of disorganization. So we established 
ties with the areas where the troops stayed, and tried to create 
stability. 
  With sugarcane, for example, where in the beginning we only 
worked on cutting the cane, we began to get involved from the 
beginning, starting with plowing the fields and working through 
the harvest. When a man is involved in all aspects of the crop, 
he begins to feel more committed. 
  There was also a dual structure handling the same mission, 
the state farm system and our organization. We tried to work 
this out, and then we took over full responsibility for the work. 
  [Carrobello] And the organizational transformations? 
  [Garcia] In the past, as I told you, our forces were 
scattered, and they worked in different areas at the same time. 
We set up a bloc system. This means concentrating resources and 
labor on the first job, and then moving on to another. This made 
the farm leadership council, composed of both civilians and 
military, remain fully involved in the field of action, seeing 
the needs and handling the forces in an operational manner. 
  [Carrobello] Is this the integral farms method? 
  [Garcia] Yes, we have over 90 all over Cuba. 
  (The general takes out a pocket diary listing all the 
production units the EJT has working. They are classified by 
municipality, and full information on the farms is provided.) 
  They work according to a weekly schedule where we list 
normal, additional, and preventive work. The additional work is 
to be done if the normal and preventive jobs are completed. So 
if fuel shortages, problems with rain, or if any other 
complications arise, they will know what to do. 
  We have also eliminated quotas. With quotas, there was a 
tendency to slack off. When the quota was met, nothing else was 
done. I have often found soldiers sitting down because they had 
finished. Now we talk of possibilities. There are many 
possibilities for young men between 18 and 20 to do more. 
  [Carrobello] Do you think all these features make the EJT 
the 
most productive force in the fields? 
  [Garcia] We are not the most productive in everything. There 
are agricultural groups that outpace us. But looking at our work 
in a general way, we are not being immodest in considering 
ourselves in the forefront. 
  Some people think we achieve this because we are military. 
There is no question that a military structure and the ages of 
our soldiers are two fundamental reasons why we are more 
efficient. But there are also factors like discipline, stringent 
requirements, and organization. These are not solely military 
attributes; these are qualities within the reach of anyone who 
wants to improve. 
  Our soldiers now harvest between 80 and 90 quintals of 
potatoes and our working tools also have an impact on that 
performance. We have found that if the right equipment is not 
used to hold the bag open properly, a man can harvest only 50 
quintals and it takes up to 13 minutes to fill a bag, which 
otherwise would be filled in three. 
  I emphasize the preparation of the tools we use. If a 
cutting 
tool does not have a shielded tip, a soldier's hands get hurt 
more and he cuts less cane. Without the right tools in good 
condition, there is no reliable productivity. 
  [Carrobello] Like any battle, a "green battle" also has its 
obstacles. What are they? 
  [Garcia] One difficulty is with the minimum amount of fuel 
we 
are supposed to get, that is assigned to us, but that does not 
reach us. That does not allow me to establish a systematic fuel 
conservation plan, as should be done. But without a doubt, our 
major problem is the collection system for our harvested crops. 
I know this issue is controversial, but I take full 
responsibility for what I am saying. 
  We have been hurt by late collections of our produce. That 
happened with potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and plantains, which 
were left out in the sun too long. The collection system has all 
kinds of mechanisms that cause damage to meats and vegetables; I 
will give you an example. Plantains are picked and then taken to 
a storage area; from there they are taken to be weighed, and 
then sent to the wholesale market, then another truck takes them 
on to other destinations. 
  That item is loaded and unloaded no less than seven to eight 
times. It takes a long time to get it to the people, and during 
its lengthy and cumbersome trip, it runs the risk of being 
stolen. 
  If we had responsibility for direct deliveries, I would not 
steal my own products. I would make sure they got to the markets 
fresh so they would be top-quality produce, and so people would 
have the quality they deserve in the products they are buying. 
  [Carrobello] So far we have talked about the virtues of the 
EJT. What are its defects? 
  [Garcia] The young men's complaints are primarily related to 
not getting enough passes. That upsets them because they work 
hard, and there are leadership personnel who are incapable of 
providing adequate answers, arguments they can understand. 
  In general, the food is accepted. They understand the 
existing situation and see the efforts we are making to improve 
it by producing our own food and exchanging products with other 
farms. 
  But we do have difficulties with recreation. There are not 
enough resources and equipment, and the cultural brigades are 
late in getting to the camps. And there are also shortages of 
clothing and shoes for the soldiers. 
  [Carrobello] Prospects, goals? 
  [Garcia] We will increase our sugarcane, citrus, and coffee 
production. But our main goal is to consolidate this new system 
of agricultural work, which demonstrates how much more can be 
accomplished when people are willing and organized.

  [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of 
Haiti has energetically protested the thoughtless statements by 
U.S. Senator Robert Graham on the occasion of his visit to Cite 
Solel on Saturday, 18 May [date as heard]. 
  His statements, the Ministry says, are contrary to all norms 
of international law and can in no way be tolerated by the 
government of the Republic. Mr. Graham's provocation is all the 
more unacceptable in his having taken advantage of the Haitian 
people's hospitality to threaten the sovereignty of this country 
and openly call for its invasion. There is no doubt that Mr. 
Graham's cynical statements lie within the scope of his 
electoral campaign. 
  Following Mr. Graham's unspeakable behavior, the government 
of the Republic of Haiti declares him persona non grata and his 
presence no longer accepted on national territory. 
  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Haiti 
takes this opportunity to invite foreigners to refrain from 
interfering in Haiti's internal affairs. 
  It should be recalled that Florida Democratic Sen. Bob 
Graham, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Port-au-Prince, 
came out in favor of a multinational military intervention in 
Haiti in case of failure of the international sanctions. He 
asserted that President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide was 
favorable to that as a necessary last resort.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The branches of 
U.S. banks Citibank and Bank of Boston in Haiti closed their 
doors today in compliance with a Washington order to broaden 
sanctions against the coupist regime. 
  A Citibank official reported the measure was adopted because 
of the White House decision to freeze the funds of Haitian 
citizens in U.S. banks, without regard to the currency in which 
they are registered. "We are taking necessary steps to obtain 
permission to continue operating, however in a limited 
capacity... that is why we prefer to close our doors today. 
This is not a definitive closing," the source declared. 
  Haiti's Ministry of Finance and Economy warned that if these 
banks do not resume their operations, the government will sue 
them to force them to respect Haitian laws. 
  The closing of the banks (the fourth and fifth largest of 
the 
nine banks operating in the country) caused discontent among 
patrons who are not on the lists of people sanctioned by the 
U.S. Government. 
  Together with the order, which expands on the one issued on 
10 June, the U.S. Treasury Department issued a list containing 
the names of 250 members of Haiti's political and economic 
elite, in addition to the nearly 650 supporters of the coupists. 
  The government of President William Clinton suspended the 
visas and resident status of Haitian senators who appointed 
Emile Jonassaint as de facto president. 
  In response to the U.S. measure, the Interior Ministry 
announced this Thursday that all foreign citizens will require a 
visa to enter the country, for which they will have to pay $50 
upon arriving in Haitian territory. 
  The Interior Ministry added that the foreigners who reside 
in 
the Caribbean country must renew their residence permit at the 
end of the current fiscal period. Foreigners must also prove 
that they have paid their taxes to the Haitian State. 
  Meanwhile, Army Commander General Raoul Cedras, whose 
resignation the U.S. Government demands as a condition to 
lifting the blockade, visited military garrisons in 
Port-au-Prince to "lift the morale of his troops." 
  The blockade against Haiti will be more restrictive as of 
0900 next Saturday, when American, Air Canada, ALM, and COPA 
airlines suspend their services to the Caribbean nation. Only 
Air France will maintain its three weekly flights. 
  As the date approaches, the coupists increase the aggressive 
tone of their speeches against the international community and 
even participate in voodoo ceremonies to invocate the 
"protection of the guardian gods against foreign intervention." 
  According to political analysts, however, the coupists have 
a 
less aggressive position than the one they held last October 
when they opposed the return of deposed President Jean Bertrand 
Aristide although they had signed the Governors Isle Agreement 
accepting Aristide's return. 
  The paramilitary Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front 
(FRAPH) canceled a strike it had announced for this Friday. 
This contrasts with its patrol operations to oblige people to 
respect the strike it decreed last October. 
  This Thursday, the two most important Haitian labor unions 
asked Cedras to resign from his post to ease the return of 
constitutional order and the lifting of the penalties that have 
negatively affected the population.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (AFP) -- This Thursday, the 
provisional government of President Emile Jonassaint (not 
recognized by the international community) established a visa 
requirement for foreign citizens whose countries demand visas 
from Haitian citizens. This measure particularly affects U.S. 
and Canadian citizens, who until now did not need visas to enter 
Haiti. 
  A government communique stated that a $50 tax will also be 
required of foreigners entering Haiti. Foreigners will be able 
to obtain visas at ports and airports in the country.

  [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Haitian "de 
facto" government announced today that it will restrict the 
movement of journalists within the country's interior as part of 
the state of emergency declared more than a week ago. 
  An Information Ministry communique released today indicates 
that media representatives will have to obtain special 
authorization to move outside Port-au-Prince. With this 
decision, the "de facto" government led by Judge Emile 
Jonassaint is attempting to limit the movement of journalists in 
Haiti. 
  On 17 June, the Information Ministry disclosed a decree in 
which it bans the presence of unauthorized people at military 
installations, on the coasts, along the border with the 
Dominican Republic, and other "strategic areas." 
  The "de facto" government also urged the owners of hotels 
nationwide to inform the police within a 24-hour period of the 
identity of foreigners staying at their facilities in order to 
maintain a record of new arrivals to the country in light of a 
possible foreign invasion. 
  The Haitian People Armed Revolutionary Front -- known as the 
Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress until 21 June -- 
suspended the general strike called for tomorrow. The strike 
was called to protest U.S. policy toward Haiti.

  [Text] The Mobilization for National Development, MDN, the 
party of professor Hubert de Ronceray, accuses the UN and the 
OAS of converting themselves into inquisition courts to crucify 
the poorest nation of the American continent. Within the next 
hours or coming days, the giants will add new cruelties to the 
Haitian age-old tragedy, states MDN leader Hubert De Ronceray. 
  [Begin De Ronceray recording] In spite of our 191 years of 
struggle against all the weariness of chronic underdevelopment, 
today, we are more isolated than ever in a hostile, merciless 
world. Our loneliness is aggravated by our noxious sense of 
identity, our indiscipline, our intolerance, and the 
pathological ambitions of our irreconcilable camps. In the 
coming hours or days, the giants will add new cruelties to our 
age-old tragedy to again remind us that human rights, stated in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the Constitution of 
the United States, and in all the world's charters, do not apply 
to the negroes of Haiti. 
  In the name of democracy, Haitians have no right to work, to 
travel, to feed themselves, to use the fruits of their labor, to 
receive medical care, etc. 
  All it takes now is to brandish the word democracy in order 
to assassinate Haiti and its people without impunity, and to 
justify the daily murder of thousands of children and young 
people, victims of an absurd, criminal embargo. 
  The misfortunes that are hitting us today could have been 
avoided if there had been, outside and inside, a minimum of 
respect for a spark of truth. Our fundamental charter forces us 
to resist all partial or total occupation of the national 
territory, to avoid satisfying individual madness linked to some 
brotherhood or hierarchy, but to assert our rights as a 
sovereign people and our determination to choose a democracy 
authentically Haitian, respectful of our laws, of our 
institutions, and of our cultural identity. 
  More hardships are ahead of us. But tomorrow will consist of 
a Haitian political solution that will bring about national and 
international reconciliation. [end recording]

  [Text] The Armed Revolutionary Front of the Haitian People, 
formerly the Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress 
of Haiti [FRAPH], has canceled their call for a strike on 
Friday, 24 June. There are many reasons for this decision, the 
spokesman for the Front stated. The academic year-end exams, the 
deadline for the U.S. sanctions to go into effect, the fact that 
the population might like to get fresh supplies, the fact that 
some people, including both Haitians and foreigners, should 
leave the country before the suspension of the commercial 
flights scheduled for Saturday, 25 June, are among the reasons 
that prompted the Front officials to withdraw their call for a 
strike, according to its spokesman.

response to the continued holding of by-elections in the absence 
of meaningful electoral reforms will not always be intellectual 
and passive. The threat comes from the Party's general 
secretary, Dr. (Percival Broderick). A communique from Dr. 
(Broderick) says the JLP finds Prime Minister Patterson's recent 
statement most unacceptable [words indistinct] the holding of 
eight parish council and constituency by-elections. 
  Dr. (Broderick) also says there has been a chorus of 
pronouncements by the government criticizing the electronic 
voting system, while an official response to the proposal has 
been deferred. Only yesterday, the JLP's two representatives 
walked out of a meeting of the electoral advisory committee. The 
JLP walkout protested a report from the acting director of 
elections that all was ready for the holding of a by-election in 
southern St. Catherine to fill the vacancy created by the 
resignation of Hugh Small.

<F P=106> [Report by Marcela Gutierrez from the "ACIR Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari announced today 
that the president of the National Human Rights Commission, 
Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, will be the new peace and reconciliation 
commissioner for Chiapas starting today. 
  Following a series of speculations as to who would replace 
Manuel Camacho Solis as peace commissioner, Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari appointed the president of the 
National Human Rights Commission, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, the new 
peace and reconciliation commissioner for Chiapas. Shortly 
after 1500, the Mexican president issued a message in which he 
reiterated the Mexican Government's commitment to resolve the 
Chiapas conflict through peaceful means. He added that 
democratic progresses and welfare with justice is not achieved 
through violence. Let us listen to what he said: 
  [Begin Salinas recording] I reaffirm my commitment to 
dialogue and negotiation as a means of attaining peace in 
Chiapas. This is a commitment to the political solution of the 
conflict. We rule out violence and the use of force as methods 
to promote and make social demands. As a demonstration of this 
determination to seek peaceful solutions to the conflict, I have 
invited Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, who has accepted, to resume the 
dialogue and attain the worthy peace demanded by Chiapas. [end 
recording] 
  President Salinas said in the Vicente Guerrero Room of the 
Los Pinos Presidential Palace that his government will make 
additional efforts to find political solutions to the Chiapas 
problem. He also agreed to make progress toward democracy 
together with the political parties and the nongovernmental 
organizations. In a five-point message, the president stated 
his determination to resume the talks and attain peace in 
Chiapas. In Point No. 3, President Salinas said the Mexican 
Army will maintain a unilateral cease-fire declared on 12 
January as long as it is not attacked. He added that patrols at 
the southern border, as well as the operations to prevent 
gunrunning activities in the area, will continue. In Point No. 
4, the president reiterated his commitment to strengthen social 
and economic actions in Chiapas in the areas of agriculture, 
health, and nutrition. Finally President Salinas said he will 
keep the public informed about the progress made in the peace 
process. 
  As the president read the message, Madrazo Cuellar stood to 
the right of the president. Salinas gave him his full support 
so that his mission as peace commissioner may be successful. It 
is expected that the president will immediately ask the Senate 
to approve the Mexican ombudsman's leave and allow him to fully 
dedicate himself to his duties as peace commissioner. 
  We have in our hands Jorge Madrazo Cuellar's resume. I am 
going to be brief. Among his many academic duties and jobs, he 
was secretary of the Technical Council of Humanities of the 
National Autonomous University of Mexico [UNAM] between January 
and September of 1977, academic secretary of the Legal Research 
Institute of the UNAM, member of the Editorial Commission of the 
Legal Research Institute, and member of the Scientific and 
Humanities Information Center of the UNAM between 1981 and 1987. 
  He has also been a member of the Editorial Council of the 
School of Accounting and Management of the UNAM, secretary of 
the Legislation Commission of the University Council, president 
of the UNAM's Editorial Property Advisory Council, member of the 
Special University Council Commission for the Election of the 
Organizing Commission of the University Council, and member of 
the jury for the 1989 National History, Philosophy, and Social 
Sciences Awards. This is quite long. He has been 
constitutional law professor at the UNAM's School of Law. 
  On 6 December 1982, Jorge Madrazo Cuellar was promoted to 
the 
rank of researcher in charge of the Legal Research Institute of 
the UNAM. He has published books and written essays and 
articles in newspapers and various media. He has presided over 
conferences in various national forums, as well as international 
forums in Spain, United States, Argentina, Canada, Guatemala, 
and Costa Rica. He belongs to the Ibero-American Institute of 
Constitutional Law. He is president of the Mexican Committee 
of the International Association of Legal Sciences. We must 
also point out that Jorge Madrazo Cuellar received the Cross of 
Honor from President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos on 
12 July 1993 in recognition for his research in the field of law 
during the celebration of Lawyer's Day. He supports an 
international drive against the death penalty and is the founder 
of an program against the death penalty organized by the 
National Human Rights Commission. He has made a special effort 
to defend women's rights, including efforts within the National 
Human Rights Commission. This is part of Jorge Madrazo 
Cuellar's resume.

<F P=106> [Second of three installments of an interview with </F>
Subcommander Marcos of the Zapatist National Liberation Army by 
Epigmenio Ibarra in the Lacandona Jungle; date not given; first 
three paragraphs are LA JORNADA introduction] 
  [Text] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas, June of 1994 -- 
Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army 
[EZLN] assured that if things stay as they are now, a peaceful 
transition to democracy seems difficult. For Marcos, "when a 
group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and 
possible -- a group mind you; I am not talking about millions of 
people, but people with enough determination or who are mad 
enough to carry out the struggle -- then big and concrete things 
can happen in this country." 
  There is skepticism about the elections in what the 
insurgent 
leader calls "the basement of our country." Those who live in 
this underground world, which pervades the country, "do not see 
an alternative in any of the candidates, or a capability by any 
of the candidates to lead a transition process to democracy." 
The subcommander warns that "they conclude that all is prepared 
for another fraud and what follows, instead of preparing for a 
peaceful transition, which is to prepare for violent change." 
  He adds that "the historic moment is set and it does not 
even 
depend on our own strength." He says the only viable 
alternative is a grand mobilization of society toward the 
so-called National Democratic Convention, as the "point of 
convergence." In this second portion of the interview, the EZLN 
military leader insists that to speak of an imminent general 
uprising is "not a threat but a warning." He also states that 
the EZLN can negotiate "with the government that rises from the 
21 August election or the government that arises from the 
convention." 
  [Ibarra] What can we do about the elections, given the fact 
that there will be nine candidates and there is supposed to be a 
different democratic atmosphere? Are the people motivated? 
  [Marcos] The truth is quite the contrary. If it were not, 
why does an armed option, such as the EZLN, continue to grow 
under a truce? It is negotiating and will presumably surrender, 
and there will soon be an election. Why does a military force 
such as ours continue to gain territory, resources, and 
strength? That is the logic we now face. Everyone tells us 
that the people are more interested in the elections or the 
World Cup Soccer Tournament. If so, we should have been 
forgotten. I think they just followed the eight column 
headlines and full page publications, and never took the 
historic events that were occurring in the country into account. 
  It is not true. In most cases, people are not interested in 
those events. There are many dissatisfied people betting on a 
violent option. If that were not so, it would be impossible for 
an army such as ours to grow, when all the technical and 
military advantages are on the other side, meaning on the side 
of the enemy. 
  We are trying to start this mobilization for the election. 
Many people approach us by many routes. They do not come 
through full-page publications, news articles, or by way of 
demonstrations. They clearly say: 

  -  None of the political 
parties offers an option; 
  -  None of the candidates offers an 
option as president of the republic; 
  -  There will surely be 
electoral fraud. 

  They are very skeptical about participating in the election. 
They do not see any alternative in any of the candidates, or 
the capability on the part of any of the candidates to lead a 
transition process to democracy. They conclude that all is 
prepared for another fraud and what follows, instead of 
preparing for a peaceful transition, which is to prepare for 
violent change. 
  Why does this happen in February, March, April, May, and now 
June, when the Clandestine Committee says no to the government's 
proposals? It is now when the electoral campaign is supposed to 
be growing and the EZLN is supposed to be relegated to second, 
third, fourth, or even fifth priority in the media. The 
electoral campaign is supposed to be the top story. 
  According to the candidates, the debates are supposed to be 
a 
landmark in the country's democratization process. All they are 
showing us is that the countries problems should be resolved by 
unconstitutional means. This only produces more skepticism. It 
produces the same reaction, as the same old show is being staged 
again. 
  Now, however, there is an option; it has been demonstrated 
that armed struggle, violent struggle, is possible. Now the 
people are deciding that armed struggle is necessary. And when 
a group of people decide that armed struggle is necessary and 
even possible -- a group, mind you; I am not talking about 
millions of people, but people with enough determination or who 
are mad enough to carry it out -- then big and concrete things 
can happen in this country. 
  [Ibarra] Can it be said that they are just a bunch of crazy 
people? 
  [Marcos] Yes, the difference between this bunch of crazy 
people in January and the bunch of crazy people in June is that 
now they are scattered throughout the nation. Now there are 
several groups of crazy people. If a group of crazy people was 
able to wreak havoc in January, I ask you: What can several 
groups of crazy people do in several states of the republic? 
  [Ibarra] It would seem as though we are headed toward a war. 
  [Marcos] We are still hopeful of what civilian society can 
do. With the effective end to the siege; with the entrance of 
the caravan of caravans, what in military terms is called a 
penetration maneuver, a collapsing of the lines; and with a 
belligerence within civil society that is very significant -- 
something that is very characteristic of sectors that 
traditionally cannot tolerate one another -- we believe it is 
yet possible to raise the banner of unity in a broadly 
progressive, democratic left-wing sector and permit its 
mobilization before 21 August to seek a transition. In any 
event, an attempt should be made to make another opening in 
which it will be possible to speak of negotiations and to speak 
of peace talks that will not deceive the country, and that will 
not use -- let me see if I can remember the word everyone is 
using -- a padlock, which I believe politicians are using right 
now. 
  Finally, the dialogue and proposals forwarded to the EZLN 
were intended to put a padlock on the armed struggle or the 
EZLN, and this proved to the EZLN that there would be no 
solution. What was being done was the initiation of a period of 
passivity to give other forces time to come into play. This can 
only continue if there is indeed a definitive and clear change 
in August. 
  [Ibarra] Are you not afraid that the influence of whoever 
calls for peace will be more important than whoever calls for 
war or warns of the possibility of war? 
  [Marcos] This is what we have expected since the 
consultation 
process, since the dialogue ended in San Cristobal. If the 
people want peace, why do they recommend that we not give up our 
weapons? Why do social sectors insist on this so much? I am not 
only talking about dispossessed sectors. I am talking about the 
middle class and the business sectors who are sympathetic to our 
movement and view with concern the possibility that we may 
surrender. 
  Why does an armed group of people, faceless people, have so 
much prestige? How can this happen if it is speaking of war, if 
it is clamoring for war, and if it represents war in this 
country? The call for peace or to foresee peace in the face of 
war is contained in the Second Lacandona Jungle Declaration. We 
say it is necessary to make room for mobilization. Peace cannot 
be a declaration or the product of negotiations at a table among 
a group of hooded men who have no names, a commissioner who is 
not a commissioner and who does not represent anyone, and a 
mediator who does not represent the church as an institution. 
  The possibility of peace has to be the product of the 
mobilization of this country, be it through an armed struggle, 
civil struggle, or civil resistance. What we are doing is 
issuing a warning, and we want this to be clear. The problem of 
peace in this country is a problem of liberty, justice, and 
democracy. Any attempt in any other direction is a masquerade 
to deceive the country or to deceive ourselves. 
  One way or another, a 1 January will happen again, but next 
time it will be uncontrollable. We believe this firmly. You 
know how difficult it is to control a military force that is 
conducting actions in a specific territory. The federal 
policemen know it well. They know that during a clash, it is 
difficult to control troops in terms of what they can do and how 
they should react. Consider what numerous armed groups would 
mean for the country. Think of what these military forces, 
acting without any possibility of being controlled by anyone, 
would signify. This is hell. This is not the San Miguel 
checkpoint; this is going to be hell. I think that the military 
will understand what I am saying if they know what a lack of 
control or lack of command in the war signifies. They are going 
to understand that the warning about a civil war is a serious 
warning to all armies in this case, to both armies, the armies 
of the federal government and the EZLN. 
  They can wipe us out, or they can appear to have wiped us 
out. They can close all of the entrances and say: "You no longer 
exist. We have killed you," even if we are alive. They can 
exercise military control over all of the valleys, and they can 
force us take to the mountains. The federal Army has the 
technical and military capability of doing this, but it will 
simply be postponing the problem once again. It could put an 
end to this rebellious group in southeastern Mexico, but other 
groups will emerge elsewhere. The federal Army cannot be 
deceived into thinking that the solution to the problem is a 
military solution. 
  One way or another, history has hit a crossroads. It no 
longer depends on our forces. It depends on the organization of 
this divided or disorganized rebellion that is called civilian 
society. It depends on how it is consolidated and how it is 
organized. We are offering an alternative -- the convention. 
The convention would serve as a meeting point for armed groups 
and civilians to regulate this peaceful transition or to give it 
a little bit of coherence and, in the best of cases, to avoid an 
outbreak of a civil war. 
  [Ibarra] Do you think the convention is indeed a suitable 
path? Can it be? 
  [Marcos] Look, we, as an armed group, do not have many 
options; we do not have other paths. We are facing a military 
siege. We cannot send delegates to speak to other forces 
because they are suspicious about whether these people are 
really Zapatists. 
  As has happened already, there are other forces who claim to 
be our forces for no other reason than to get money. In turn, 
there is a great deal of mistrust in other social sectors if 
someone comes and says: "I am a Zapatist; let us reach some 
agreement." Then, the only possibility left is to call upon all 
sectors to come and speak to us under terms of equality, but not 
to negotiate a surrender; this is what the San Cristobal 
dialogue attempt was. Instead, we need to talk and reach 
agreements on something -- for example, on what we oppose or 
what immediate steps should be taken in order that what we 
oppose does not happen. We have no other alternative, but we 
would welcome other efforts. Nevertheless, we feel there is so 
much skepticism among the people, but the government and the 
political parties still do not understand this. We see no 
alternative. 
  For example, political parties all think the same thing: 
"People are going to forget about the EZLN, and we are going to 
retake the key role bestowed upon us by the calendar." The 
calendar gives them a piece of democracy, a piece of electoral 
change. The opposite, however, would happen -- and understand 
me clearly on this -- because in the period leading up to the 
elections a force that cannot participate in the elections is 
growing, an armed, clandestine force, a force without a face and 
which has a numerical disadvantage. This is not logical. 
Something is happening in this country, and I remind you about 
what I said in the last interview, when I told you: When 
everyone in the world had said "no" to armed struggles because 
of the disappearance of the socialist bloc, because of what 
happened in Nicaragua, because of the negotiations of El 
Salvador, and because the beginning of negotiations in Guatemala 
-- when everyone said "no" to armed struggles, why did we grow 
in 1992 and 1993? Why does an armed movement generate so much 
support in January 1994? 
  Moreover, we are again issuing a warning, because in the 
pre-electoral period this force is growing, and this means that 
something is wrong. Something is still wrong in this country; 
there was no change, and no one believes there has been a 
change. There is a very serious credibility problem in terms of 
the legitimacy of the electoral process. The only way to 
legitimize the electoral process is for the government to step 
aside, for both the government and the government party to step 
aside. This is the alternative; the alternative was outlined in 
January, and it cannot be called the EZLN. It must be called 
something different. But believe me, weapons are going to 
thunder again if change is not produced. This is a warning, not 
a threat. 
  Now they are telling us in the newspapers: "They are making 
threats from a position of force." No. We could surrender the 
weapons, everyone would be happy, and the situation would 
explode on 1 January, but all over the place. [sentence as 
published] Also, there would be no checks and balances, and 
then they would have regrets and repentance would follow. 
  [Ibarra] But your political vision seems a bit too narrow 
because how can negotiations resume if you call for the 
president to resign, and if he resigns, will you put him on 
trial? 
  [Marcos] No. We are not calling for negotiations with the 
government. Our "negative" response and the conclusion of the 
San Cristobal dialogue mean that there is no room or conditions 
for this to happen. I think the government recognizes this, and 
it already has made concessions in this regard. I want to state 
that we are giving up on a dialogue or an attempt at 
negotiations because we establish, in the document, that it is 
inappropriate to speak to a government that does not want to 
change. On the other hand, it is time to speak to the people 
who want to change it. We are saying we could talk and 
negotiate with another government -- perhaps with the government 
elected on 21 August or the government resulting from the 
convention. 
  [Ibarra] Even if the government elected on 21 August is a 
PRI 
[Institutional Revolutionary Party] government presided over by 
Zedillo? 
  [Marcos] We could deceive ourselves once more. We could try 
to speak and talk with such a government, but just look at the 
statements by Zedillo after we said "no." It is clear this 
gentleman has placed no hope in negotiations, and certainly he 
is not the government representative who has become our 
spokesman. With what determination or confidence can we talk to 
this gentleman, a gentleman, who following the dialogue, all the 
procedures, and the cease-fire declared that the negotiations 
failed, that dialogue is a failure? Evidently, this gentleman 
would want to negotiate with weapons; that is, he wants to talk 
to us with bullets. It is clear that he does not want to reach 
an accord and that he is not open to listening to us. 
Evidently, a Zedillo administration that may win the August 
elections would be a very problematic government to talk to, 
especially in terms of conditions and an agenda for such talks. 
  Also, it would raise a question among all armed and unarmed 
Mexicans: Did he really win, or is it once again a sham? The 
sham might be clear -- say, a shameless fraud -- or it might be 
subtle. Nevertheless, even if he wins technically with so many 
votes over his closest opponent, he already faces a credibility 
problem. No one is going to believe this gentleman won the 
presidential elections after his performance. If it wins the 
presidential elections, the PRI's problem will not be the EZLN. 
Instead, its problem will be that of the entire country -- all 
Indian and peasant groups, workers, students, teachers, 
housewives, settlers. If it wins the presidential elections, 
the problem for the PRI will be a civil war; that is what its 
problem will be. 
  [Ibarra] To be direct, there can be no peace with the PRI. 
  [Marcos] No. This is final. Under these conditions, we have 
remained silent about what happens in other cases. People are 
no longer willing to wait for a commitment to behave properly 
and to make changes because the PRI is founded on a false system 
at all levels. The PRI has its own name and image, and it must 
pay its debts to everyone: Indian chiefs in Indian communities, 
municipal presidents, police chiefs, judicial police commanders, 
secretaries and engineers from some governmental office, 
employees, and others. The PRI has a name and a face for the 
people; the PRI can be blamed for anything that happens to 
anyone because it appointed an official somewhere whom it cannot 
remove now. As a political party, the PRI is built on these 
kinds of situations. It is impossible, as we said in our second 
declaration, for the government to comply with the 
San Cristobal agreement because it can do nothing to try to 
comply with it. I repeat: The PRI is built on such situations. 
  Look how the seemingly most rational and logical agreement 
-- 
one that denounces discrimination against Indians and recognizes 
their dignity -- sparks reactions from the true natives of 
San Cristobal de las Casas and from the cattle ranchers who 
maintain that saying Indians are honorable is racism because 
they ask: So what does that make those who are not Indians? 
They even oppose this view. This cannot be. I insist the EZLN 
is not the problem; the whole country is the problem. The 
people are no longer willing to give the PRI another 
opportunity. Let us say the 1 January No more slogan 
has become No more state party by June 1994. I am 
telling you, we are betting on this in light of our analysis of 
the situation. 
  [Ibarra] What we are talking about here is the permanence of 
the state party. 
  [Marcos] Then, it does not make sense. If this system still 
has an opportunity to perpetuate itself, and if it still has the 
strength to rule, then why does a force that disadvantageously 
rebels against this system grow under such conditions? It is 
growing not only in the dispossessed sectors; its acceptance is 
growing in middle class sectors and even in business sectors. 
This force that is demanding change must have something to it. 
What we are saying is this: There seems to be a consensus 
among many sectors -- understand me on this -- and even among 
privileged classes, on the belief that the state party must 
disappear; there are few other alternatives. 
  [Ibarra] What alternatives are left then? 
  [Marcos] What we are proposing is a transition period for a 
transition government to make time for the diverse groups to 
organize themselves and to face whomever there is to face. This 
includes the majority of the population. This is what we are 
saying: If there are many forces that agree the state party must 
disappear, but they are divided on what should replace the 
party, then let us have a transition government to give these 
forces time to properly propose alternatives and see what 
happens. 
  They say: "We lack time, because the elections are so 
close." 
This is how we respond: You lack time because the war is 
already coming. They must understand this. The problem in 
August is not the elections; it is the war. This is why we are 
saying the only possibility of resolving this problem is 
agreeing on appointing someone while the change is being 
organized. This someone must keep things more or less stable 
while we determine what forces are going to influence or head 
what is now being usurped by the state party -- namely, the 
people's resolve.

<F P=106> [Report by Candelaria Rodriguez and Jose Antonio Roman] </F>
  [Text] Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, 20 Jun -- The position 
adopted by the Zapatist National Liberation Army, EZLN, which 
Subcommander Marcos has disclosed, does not affect the federal 
government's intentions and plans to fulfill the pledges it has 
made "because those pledges are totally justified and are 
promises made to the communities," said Hector Hernandez Llamas, 
a member of the government's executive Peace Commission in 
Chiapas. 
  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has imparted 
instructions 
for full execution of the government's 2 March pledges, and 
after the EZLN's refusal to comply eight days ago, the same 
orders were imparted. The reached agreements, as well as 
changes in the judicial system, Hernandez has said, are needed 
by the communities that will benefit from them. 
  Regarding the funds earmarked for the war zone, 1 billion 
pesos, the Peace Commission member has said a large percentage 
of that money is for such services as health and highway 
infrastructure in three areas: jungles, mountains, and border 
regions. Another considerable portion will be used for 
education, although productive projects will not be neglected. 
  The federal government must finalize its programs for 
electricity, a rural telephone system, and potable water for the 
townships by October. Efforts are also being made in the area 
of education. A significant number of elementary school 
children will be included in the school system in September, 
particularly in communities that have irregular school systems. 
  It is expected that production projects will have been 
agreed 
upon and operational by June and July if the federal and state 
governments finalize their plans and clearly prove their desire 
to execute actions which, once and for all, will create a better 
future and a more optimistic outlook on life for the Chiapas 
communities. The government wants a return to peace that will 
foster better living conditions for the communities in that 
state. 
  Hernandez said it is necessary for both sides to yield. We 
will be able to find ways of reaching agreements and working 
together as long as they have the resolve to do so. Hernandez 
concluded that as the elements emerge, "we will solidify in 
time, form, and space the general agreements reached at the 
beginning of March in San Cristobal de las Casas. [no closing

  [Text] Yesterday, the National Human Rights Committee 
(CNDH) circulated a new primer on human rights to increase 
Indians' knowledge about their basic rights. This primer, which 
is the 17th the CNDH has issued since it was founded, is 
directed mainly at the Indians of Los Altos and the Lacandona 
Jungle of Chiapas. 
  In the introduction, the CNDH states that on 28 January 
1992, 
the DIARIO OFICIAL published the decree by which an initial 
paragraph was added to Article No. 4 of the Constitution 
"recognizing the Mexican Indian peoples and stating that their 
existence signifies the basis for the nation's multicultural 
composition." 
  Further on, the primer emphasizes that according to Article 
No. 27 of the Constitution; Article No. 128, Section No. 4, of 
the Federal Code of Penal Procedures; Article No. 269, Section 
No. 4, and Article No. 296 of the Federal District Code of Penal 
Procedures; and Article No. 164 of the Agrarian Law, as well as 
the 1989 Agreement No. 169 of the International Labor Office on 
Indian and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, Indian 
peoples have the following rights, among others: 
  1. Indian peoples deserve special respect for their rights 
and dignity, as well as for their culture and tradition. 
  2. Indian communities have the right to protect their 
languages, cultures, traditions, customs, resources, and 
specific forms of social organization, circumstances that permit 
them to maintain and strengthen their identity, as long as they 
are not incompatible with basic rights as defined by the law or 
with internationally recognized human rights. 
  3. Indian peoples have full fundamental rights, freedoms, 
and privileges, which the law grants without any discrimination. 
  4. Indian communities have the right to the peace that 
permits them to safeguard their members' lives. 
  5. Indian peoples have the right to an economic, 
political, and social development that guarantees a decent life. 
  6. The state must guarantee Indians' effective access to 
justice. 
  7. In federal and local trials involving Indians, their 
legal customs and traditions will be taken into consideration 
during the proceedings and when a final decision is made.

  [Text] President Carlos Salinas says the reformation of 
Article No. 27 puts an end to the great Zapatist revolution. He 
said the struggle for land is over and now the battle is for 
production and democracy. 
  The president distributed common land [ejido] titles and 
confirmed the legality of the documents. Thus far this year, 
600,000 peasants have received land titles, thanks to an 
extensive statistical effort to establish boundaries. 
  In Aguascalientes, dozens of peasants gathered to hear 
President Salinas deliver a message of reconciliation. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] The men and women of the 
countryside no longer want to exhaust themselves in conflicts. 
The struggle for land is over, and the victors are the Mexican 
peasants. [end recording] 
  The president said an effort will be made to prevent 
conflicts from eroding agrarian reform. He told the peasants 
who received titles that their agrarian certificates puts an end 
to the Zapatist revolution. The EZLN's lands are legally 
secure, but that is not enough in one of the most backward 
sectors of the economy. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] A struggle is now being waged for 
the peasants to make their own decisions regarding production, 
organization, democracy, and freedom. [end recording] 
  The president's tour was devoted to land ownership. In 
Matamoros, Tamaulipas, the ceremony was very symbolic. Among 
the people who gathered were 11 peasants who descended from the 
group to whom Lucio Blanco in 1913 presented the first plot of 
land resulting from the Mexican Revolution. Eighty-one years 
later, they have titles for their plots. 
  [Begin Salinas recording] We have fulfilled the pledge of 
the government of the Mexican Revolution. [end recording] 
  In this border city the president confirmed his pledge to 
defend the country's sovereignty and independence.

  [Text] Yesterday, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
reiterated that Mexican Petroleum [PEMEX] will remain state 
owned and that it will continue its active modernization to 
transform its structures, raise its efficiency, and establish a 
more transparent price policy. 
  He added that so far during his administration, the 
state-owned company has reduced its operational costs 30 percent 
and that now, its products represent almost half of its sales. 
[sentence as published] 
  When President Salinas de Gortari delivered the National 
Institute Prize for Public Administration to Benjamin Garcia 
Paez, he said: "The strategic state-owned company is preparing 
for Mexico to face 21st century world challenges. The change 
has resulted in a strengthening of Mexico's presence in the 
world economy." 
  He stressed that the company plans to reach greater 
operational efficiency while simultaneously generating clear 
social benefits. The efficient performance of the company 
translates into a strategic push for the nation's economy. 
  Salinas said: "PEMEX will continue being the property of the 
Mexican people because it is efficient and meets it social 
goals." In this way, he added, equal development is guaranteed, 
social consensus is created, and efforts are joined to 
strengthen the nation.

  [Text] Culiacan, Sinaloa, 29 Jun -- Virgilio de la Fuente 
Ruiz, director of the National Counternarcotics Institute 
(INCD), has reported that an operation involving 41 federal 
agents was implemented today in the mountainous areas of the 
States of Sinaloa, Durango, and Chiahuahua to intensify the 
struggle against drug trafficking. 
  He also said the INCD has eight agents, highly qualified in 
the area of investigation, who will work full-time to determine 
the activities, whereabouts, and money laundering activities of 
Sinaloa's most important drug traffickers and drug producers. 
The official said the 41 federal agents are part of a select 
group of investigators, adding that they were taken in 
helicopters to bases the Attorney General's Office (PGR) has set 
up in mountainous areas. 
  The official stressed that authorities will investigate 
those 
who finance the production of narcotics because the aim is to 
specifically punish those who provide the financial resources, 
not so much drug couriers. The INCD director asserted that 
authorities have detected some marijuana and poppy plantations 
in the mountains dividing Durango, Chihuahua, and Sonora. 
  Meanwhile, Antonio Figueroa Lee, president of the Alberto 
Sanchez Gonzalez Bar Association, affirmed that the PGR must 
improve the process of selecting agents to effectively fight 
drug trafficking.

the "powerful dynamics," oppositions, expectations, and

OECD.

Mexican Consuls (the previous two meetings were held in 1990 and 
1992), the official said the nation is experiencing important, 
transcendental, historic moments, an accelerated transformation, 
and a process of modernization in all sectors. 
  He said that based on joining NAFTA, APEC, and the OECD, the 
country is now poised as a forerunner within the international 
economic system and has linked up with the world's most dynamic 
trend in economic growth as well as trade and technological 
exchange. 
  Tello told the 56 Mexican honorary consuls that 
domestically, 
with the participation of all the political and social forces, a 
consensus has been reached and mechanisms have been established 
so that this year's elections will be legal, open, and credible. 
  He also spotlighted Mexicans' commitment to firm, unyielding 
democracy, saying: "The electoral competition we are witnessing 
proves this commitment overwhelmingly." 
  At the meeting where four display tables were set up for the 
promotion of image, foreign trade, tourism, consular and 
immigration matters, the consuls were supplied with up-to-date 
material to appropriately promote the nation.x President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari received the officials at the presidential 
residence, Los Pinos, at the end of the meeting.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on developments related to the elections scheduled for 
21 August. 
  Ernesto Zedillo, presidential candidate for the 
Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, PRI, presents a 10-point program to combat 
poverty, pledges to continue to implement and decentralize the 
solidarity program, and calls upon all Mexicans to join in the 
fight against poverty. 
  Cuauthemoc Cardenas, presidential candidate for the Party of 
the Democratic Revolution, PRD, finishes a three-day visit to 
Chihuahua State and is criticized by the National Action Party, 
PAN, for his negative comments on PAN Governor Francisco 
Barrios. PAN publicly accuses Cardenas of diverting funds while 
he was governor of Michoacan. 
  National Opposition Union, UNO, candidate Pablo Emilio 
Maderos visits the National Autonomous University of Mexico 
where he pledges to fight unemployment and poverty. 
  Jorge Gonzalez Torres, presidential candidate for the 
Mexican 
Green Ecologist Party, PVEM, visits Oaxaca State, where he says 
the 21 August elections will suffer because of the high level of 
poverty in Mexico. He calls for a peaceful solution to the 
Chiapas conflict because, he says, an armed conflict benefits no 
one. [Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 16 
Jun 94] 
  In Veracruz, Zedillo speaks to thousands of PRI members, 
saying the country's institutional life cannot be negotiated or 
transformed into the political gain of uncompromising 
minorities. He calls upon Mexicans to respect social peace, 
sovereignty, national unity, independence, and freedom. [Mexico 
City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 17 Jun 94 pp 1-5] 
  Rafael Aguilar Talamantes, presidential candidate for the 
Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction, ends his visit to 
several Jalisco municipalities. 
  Labor Party candidate Cecilia Soto holds a news conference 
in 
Reynosa, Tamaulipas State, during which she says that the United 
States should provide Mexico and Colombia with evidence of its 
will to reduce drug use, combat money laundering and arms 
smuggling, and prosecute drug lords in the United States. 
[Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 17 Jun 
94] 
  Cardenist Front candidate Aguilar Talamantes says Peace 
Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis' resignation is good for the 
country and that his party and the Zapatist National Liberation 
Army, EZLN, are both fighting for the same improvements. [Mexico 
City Canal 13 Television Azteca Network in Spanish 1300 GMT 20 
Jun 94] 
  During an interview, PRD candidate Cardenas pledges to 
improve Mexico's education system and says there is still time 
to make electoral reforms. [Mexico City XEW Television Network 
in Spanish 0430 GMT 21 Jun 94] 
  PRI candidate Zedillo admits that problems in the electoral 
process have made would-be voters distrustful. He invites PRI 
businessmen and intellectuals to attend meetings on his behalf 
because such meetings would lend legitimacy to his probable 
victory. [Monterrey EL NORTE (Foreign Edition) in Spanish 21 Jun 
94 p 1A] 
  Zedillo campaigns in Villa Alvaro Obregon, a Mexico City 
low-income neighborhood where he reiterates his pledge to combat 
excessive poverty. In Mexico City, Labor Party candidate Soto 
calls for reforming the power of the president. [Mexico City 
Radio ACIR Network in Spanish 0140 GMT 22 Jun 94] 
  A new group called the Citizen's Network has been created to 
promote peace during the elections. The PRD calls for an 
amendment to the Electoral Law, but the PRI disagrees. Zedillo 
says the people, not the government, own the solidarity program 
because the people pay for it. PAN presidential candidate Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos denies that his campaign has slowed down, 
saying that he stopped visiting small communities only because 
such visits make him lose sight of the larger picture. Labor 
Party candidate Soto proposes a women's secretariat and claims 
that she is the victim of slander on the part of her opponents. 
[Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430 GMT 22 Jun 
94] 
  The Federal Electoral Institute, IFE, reports that foreign 
visitors will be allowed to observe the coming August elections 
as a means of eliminating suspicions of fraud but the visitors 
will be banned from participating in political activities. IFE 
reports that the 48 million ballots required for the coming 
elections have been sent to the states. Zedillo holds a meeting 
at the Change 21 Foundation, where he says it is necessary to 
create a new federalism. In Toluca, Labor Party candidate Soto 
opposes the PRD's proposal to institute the death sentence.

  [Text] Guatemala City, 21 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Guatemalan 
President Ramiro de Leon Carpio today announced a "hardline" 
policy against drug trafficking, terrorism, general violence, 
and the seizure of land, which "discourages" investments. 
  The president said his administration will firmly act to 
dissuade "covert groups" that seek to sow anarchy and unrest in 
the country in order "to subsequently destabilize the 
government." 
  De Leon Carpio said he will not have the national and 
international community believe he heads a weak government that 
is overwhelmed by corruption and infiltrated by drug trafficking. 
  During a visit to the outskirts of the capital, the 
president 
said he will end the country's anarchy, which is reflected by 
high crime rates, kidnappings, and attacks against the 
infrastructure. 
  "We are going to respond with the law in our hands, because 
we have a strong government now. There will be respect for 
freedoms and rights in the fight against various crimes," the 
former human rights ombudsman said. 
  The Guatemalan president reiterated "there are covert 
groups" 
that seek to destabilize his administration by seizing land. "I 
am going to respond to the demands of the Guatemalan people, who 
no longer want violence, bloodbaths, and armed confrontations," 
de Leon said. The president has been in office since 6 June 
1993. The Guatemalan Government and the Guatemalan National 
Revolutionary Unity (URNG) have been negotiating for several 
months to sign a peace agreement that will end the more than 
30-year-old armed conflict. 
  "I am going to punish those responsible for public 
insecurity," the president warned. He has been severely 
criticized by political opponents due to the wave of 
kidnappings, dynamite attacks, threats, and generalized violence 
in the streets. 
  Human Rights Ombudsman Jorge Mario Garcia has said that 
after 
one year in office, de Leon has yet to respond to the general 
clamor for an end to the attacks and violence, which bring 
mourning to the country. Guatemalan Indian leader Rigoberta 
Menchu, who received the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize, has expressed 
her "disillusionment" over the current administration.

  [Text] The first meeting for peace and reconciliation was 
held on 22 June at the Central American Parliament. President 
Ramiro de Leon Carpio attended the ceremony. During his speech, 
the president referred to the importance of the event: 
  [Begin de Leon recording] This meeting clearly exemplifies 
the existence of a general, spontaneous movement to achieve a 
united criteria, links in the chain of progress toward a better 
Guatemala in all aspects. Upon seeing all of you gathered here, 
I am moved to finally see the initial fruits of an action 
favoring the signing of peace. 
  I invite you to do everything within your reach to make this 
first meeting for peace and reconciliation precisely that: the 
first of a series of similar meetings in which a group of 
brothers will seek the best for their fellow human beings and 
for themselves. I ask you not to be deterred by fear in the face 
of a situation to which we are not accustomed, because we have 
been immersed for so long in a fratricidal war. I also ask you 
not to listen to those who do not believe in, disqualify, and 
label as a betrayal the act of participating in this peace 
process in Guatemala. 
  In these meetings, I ask you to face the new Guatemalan 
reality with enthusiasm and dedication. Peace depends on the 
political resolve of the parties that are directly involved. 
That resolve exists with total certainty on the part of the 
government, over which I am honored to preside. That political 
resolve, allow me to say, has been totally confirmed and proven 
in the past months, in the past hours, and in the past minutes 
in Oslo. This has been confirmed not only on the part of the 
friendly countries of the process but, in general, by the entire 
international community. That is why I dare say the government 
is more concerned that that peace, which for us is and should be 
irreversible, should be a lasting peace. That is why we must 
all prepare for it, to fight the causes that might generate new 
outbreaks of groups that are discontent not for ideological 
reasons but, rather, for economic or social reasons. 
  We must attempt to achieve the total and absolute respect of 
Guatemalans' human rights, not just individual rights because we 
are on that path, but also, and especially, economic, social, 
and cultural rights. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel Martinez] </F>
  [Text] Their greatness cannot be diminished, only 
confirmed. Ideas have a face, said Sergio Ramirez at an 
assembly. And ideas are symbols that motivate action. Rebellion 
against the ideas championed by Sergio Ramirez has taken shape 
in the political defeat of the proposals to reform the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front (FSLN). The fact that Sergio was not 
elected to the National Directorate is, symbolically, something 
akin to the expulsion of the archangel Lucifer. That is because 
Sergio Ramirez's great virtue, or the danger he poses, is his 
contribution as the visible head of the current of the 
"Sandinism that would return to the majorities." But the mere 
fact that he shook the foundations of the FSLN, regardless of 
his defeat, as Monica Baltodano correctly stated in a radio 
interview, is a precedent that can only be fully appreciated as 
the FSLN's future unfolds. The first sign of its implications 
will come with the results obtained by the FSLN in the 1996 
elections. 
  Others, more adept than he at allying themselves with those 
who really hold the reins of power, at the last minute jumped on 
board the orthodox, radical boat. They ended up with a high 
number of votes and kept their share of power. They clung to 
power without regard for the political consequences suffered by 
the FSLN. 
  A party that paralyzes itself and loses the momentum of 
renewal places itself on the sidelines of the power game. The 
consequences are not something that can be foreseen with a 
crystal ball, but by analyzing the course of events, it is 
possible to predict the future clearly. And in this case, I 
think the prognosis is delicate and guarded. 
  Sergio Ramirez is one of the most astute thinkers in the 
FSLN, and in this defeat, Sergio Ramirez revealed his true human 
greatness as never before. Not even when he bravely led the 
Group of 12, or during his tireless efforts as vice president of 
the Republic, did he show us the magnitude of his capacity as a 
politician and intellectual. Now, more than ever, he 
demonstrated his ability to bravely take on an inescapable 
proposition from which there was no shirking, and he stood firm 
even though it meant his ouster. 
  His contribution, for example, to the idea that authority 
cannot continue to be vested in a group anointed for historical 
reasons, when that model has been outmoded by our present 
reality, and that the fulcrum of power should rest on 
rank-and-file Sandinists chosen in open elections, had to come 
at a high cost. And he paid that cost in the purge. But like 
everything in life, the seed has been planted, the work has 
begun, and it inevitably will bear fruit.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Francisco Bravo Lacayo] </F>
  [Text] It cannot be denied that our unity was shattered at 
the Sandinist Front Congress. The outcome of the congress was 
logical and foreseeable, given the intense preparatory activity 
carried out by Commander Daniel Ortega and his sympathizers, who 
took advantage of their strategic positions in the party 
apparatus. 
  But does this mean that the front is irredeemably doomed to 
division and failure in the civic battles that lie ahead? 
  We sincerely believe it is not. Everything will depend on 
how 
and in what manner pending issues are dealt with, on how the 
Sandinist comrades led by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado are 
treated, and on how they react. 
  In spite of everything, we believe that the seeds for 
unity in diversity were planted, and the only reason 
more was not accomplished was the lack of time and space. If 
Daniel's deeds match his words, he will find a way to stanch 
possible wounds and to prevent the cracks that threaten to widen 
from irreversibly destroying the unity that is so 
badly needed. 
  It is not a question of approaching the problem of unity 
from 
romantic positions, but of standing firmly on the principles 
that demand viable unity as a sine qua non for 
solving the myriad problems that are assailing most Nicaraguans. 
  We are alarmed by Comrade Monica Baltodano's statement 
threatening to oust Sergio Ramirez as head of the Sandinist 
delegation at the National Assembly, rather than appealing to 
him to try to coordinate the effort. The same is true of 
BARRICADA Editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro. 
  If the threat of removal materializes, it will be a 
demonstration of ayatollah-like intolerance that will have an 
adverse impact on our people's mentality, and as a consequence, 
it will be another nail in the coffin of the Sandinist Front's 
aspirations to return to power. 
  That is why we said yesterday that we must put an end to 
vengeance, that virulent disease that has plagued us Nicaraguans 
and prevented us from reaching a consensus to save our country. 
  It is necessary and positive for all the factions in the 
Front, be they large or small, majority or minority, to avoid 
exaggerating their differences. Each person should do his part 
to contribute to the spirit of brotherhood that should prevail 
in a revolutionary organization. 
  The congress adopted positive resolutions that at least 
challenged the old rhetoric. Sandinists should take heed and 
continue working on this unfinished task.

Baltodano--for related reporting on this issue see 
FBIS-LAT-94-104] 
  [Text] Managua, 24 May 1994 
  Mr. Carlos Fernando Chamorro Editor of BARRICADA Your Office 
  Dear Carlos Fernando: 
  In today's edition of BARRICADA, dated 24 May 1994, was a 
front-page story under the headline "New National Directorate 
Takes Aim at BARRICADA." On the third-page continuation of the 
story, under the headline "Purges Ahead in the Sandinist 
National Liberation Front (FSLN)," are my responses to questions 
asked of me by the press early the morning of Monday, 23 May. 
  To avoid any ambiguity, I would like to make the following 
clarifications: 
  1. At no time did I suggest changes in the executive 
positions at the daily BARRICADA, since that decision is and 
always has been up to the collective of the National Directorate. 
  2. I came out against any vengeful attitude and pointed out 
that if we were not vengeful with the Somoza National Guard, why 
should we be with comrades from our own ranks? I made it clear 
that it is not a question of turning away good will, but of 
attracting more good will. 
  3. I reaffirm my conviction, which I have defended at many 
party assemblies, that BARRICADA's editorial line must undergo 
substantial changes. I think that in saying that I am 
representing the opinion of the FSLN rank and file. But that 
does not necessarily mean that this opinion is shared by the 
bodies elected by the congress. 
  4. At no time have I ever thought, nor do I think now, that 
BARRICADA should become the official organ of the FSLN, much 
less a mere parrot for repeating party slogans or a political 
pamphlet. 
  5. In conclusion, I am totally convinced that BARRICADA will 
be able to defend and promote the political line that can be 
deduced from the desires expressed in the Program, Principles, 
and Bylaws agreed upon at the Special Session of the FSLN 
Congress. This will help strengthen the cohesion and unity of 
the Sandinist rank and file, which is of vital importance in 
confronting our eternal adversaries. 
  Fraternally, 
  Monica Baltodano

  [Excerpt] Toronto, 21 Jun (EFE) -- On 21 June, the Canadian 
and Argentine Governments signed a nuclear cooperation treaty 
that will allow Argentina to broaden its program for the use of 
nuclear power. 
  The document was signed during a special ceremony attended 
by 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Argentine President 
Carlos Menem, who is paying a three-day visit to Canada. 
According to the agreement, Canada may provide special 
technology and cooperation in the nuclear field to Argentina. 
  The agreement will allow Argentina to make better use of its 
nuclear resources for strictly peaceful purposes, especially in 
the energy field, according to official Canadian sources. 
  Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet said during the 
ceremony that the agreement "marks the beginning of a new phase 
of the relationship between the two countries." 
  The minister announced Canada will sell Argentine technology 
and equipment for the installation of a second nuclear plant in 
addition to granting aid for the research being carried out by 
Argentine experts. 
  The agreement was signed after Argentina this week signed 
the 
nuclear nonproliferation treaty in which the signatory countries 
agree to use nuclear power strictly for peaceful purposes.

  [Text] During the second day of his official visit to 
Canada, President Carlos Menem said that while he is president 
the peso will maintain its current exchange parity with the 
dollar. He reiterated that there is no possibility of 
devaluating the peso and confirmed that he will meet with his 
American colleague, Bill Clinton on 24 June in Washington. 
  Contradicting all predictions, the president announced he 
will be in Washington when the Argentine team plays Nigeria. He 
will watch the game on television. Moreover, his advisers 
assure that Menem will return to Buenos Aires on the night of 24 
June. 
  The chief of state granted an interview to the Canadian 
media, breakfasted with leading businessmen and some government 
officials, and signed cooperation agreements with official 
organizations of the Canadian Government. 
  "There is no chance that the peso will be devaluated because 
that would return us to a tragic experience that Argentines have 
already suffered. To return to what we had before would be 
fatal for Argentina," he stressed during a meeting with 
executives. 
  He said Argentina has buried "the culture of speculation as 
the rule, we are now entering an era of work and production." 
  He acknowledged that there is pressure "especially from the 
export sector," adding that to change the parity that has been 
established by the convertibility plan would be "bad for the 
rest of the Argentine community." 
  The president told Canadian officials and businessmen that 
Argentina is ready to join NAFTA -- the free trade zone among 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico. He admitted, however, 
that an invitation has not been received to participate in the 
agreement. Canadian International Trade Minister Roy McLaren 
immediately answered: "If that decision were ours alone to make, 
we would extend it today." The minister added that Argentina 
can rely on "all possible support" from the Canadian Government, 
which is "willing to do so." During a personal meeting with 
Menem on the first day of the visit, Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien expressed this sentiment to the Argentine president. 
  The president and 20 Argentine executives, who are in Canada 
seeking investment and buyers for national products, met with a 
dozen Canadian businessmen, including representatives of 
companies that participated in Argentine privatizations and 
high-ranking Ottawa government officials. 
  Menem confirmed he will meet with President Clinton at the 
White House on 24 June and denied that he would watch the 
Argentina-Nigeria match on 25 June in Boston. 
  It was officially reported that the chief of state will meet 
and play golf with former U.S. President George Bush at his 
residence the state of Maine. The delegation will travel to 
Washington in the official Argentine plane. 
  Menem will arrive in the U.S. capital early on the morning 
of 
24 June for his meeting at the White House with the U.S. 
President, and remain in the city until after the 
Argentina-Nigeria game. He will return that same day to Buenos 
Aires. 
  During his meeting with the media, Menem said he asked the 
Canadian authorities to "stop the dumping" [preceding word in 
English] of 1,400 tons of Canadian wheat in Brazil at prices 
below the international market. This move provoked losses of 
$180 million for Argentina. 
  "We were a closed and statist country but we are now opening 
up. Out of loyalty, we ask the nations that have always had a 
market economy to now act with equality," Menem maintained. He 
insisted that Argentina's regional integration priorities lie 
with the Common Market of the South because "there are good 
prospects for doing excellent business deals." He indicated 
that poverty, which afflicts "40 percent of Latin Americans," 
and unemployment, which "has reached alarming levels despite the 
growing economies," are the two most serious and urgent problems 
afflicting humanity. 
  The president took the opportunity to express his viewpoint 
on the international political map. He said he approves of 
military intervention in Haiti, adding that he has "good" 
personal "relations" with Cuban President Fidel Castro.

<F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Nancy Pazos in Quebec, </F>
Canada] 
  [Text] Carlos Menem already has discovered a finishing 
flourish for his tour of northern North America. At the White 
House on 24 June, the president will announce to his U.S. 
counterpart, Bill Clinton, that Argentina is willing to send men 
to the Dominican Republic to reinforce controls at the Haitian 
border as the Haiti Friends Club proposed in the United Nations. 
  Haiti was the first issue U.S. State Department people 
included on the bilateral agenda for the meeting with Menem. 
The United States is waiting for a definition of the political 
situation of that country. Some people are speculating that if 
the international embargo imposed against the dictatorship of 
Raoul Cedras does not yield any results, the United States would 
be willing to invade Haiti. 
  During the few breaks in their Canadian tour that ended in 
Quebec, a city privileged by nature, Menem and his foreign 
minister, Guido Di Tella, reviewed the stance that Argentina 
will take on various issues. A sentence that echoed frequently 
in the president's ears was: "Within the UN and OAS framework, 
and within this framework alone, we are ready for anything." 
  Argentine joined the Friends Club two weeks ago, already 
made 
up of the United States, France, Canada, and Venezuela and 
coordinated by former UCR [Radical Civic Union] Foreign Minister 
Dante Caputo, representing the OAS. 
  The Friends Club's initial measure involved canceling all 
commercial flights (the only air connection with foreign 
countries is Air France) and freezing the bank accounts the 
Haitians -- and their closest relatives -- who participated in 
the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide have in the 
United States. 
  The Friends Club also fixed its eyes on the 
Haitian-Dominican 
border. It believes the international embargo might be evaded 
through this 300-km-long border. 
  Menem actually does not have to resort to the announcement 
to 
demonstrate his siding with the U.S. stance. Our country 
actually is the only Latin American country that supports the 
maritime trade embargo with a corvette. Nevertheless, the 
president had to make a showy gesture, and he is aware of the 
fact that Haiti represents an obsession for Clinton. 
  In addition to the presidents, U.S. Vice President Al Gore, 
Christopher Warren and Anthony Laker (the two Department of 
State heads)n [name and title as published], U.S. Ambassador to 
Argentina James Cheek, Guido Di Tella, and Raul Granillo Ocampo, 
the Argentine ambassador to the United States, will meet around 
the oval table in the White House. 
  Messages to finalize the details kept coming from the United 
States on 22 June while Menem's entourage hurried to complete 
its extensive tour of Quebec (that included a golf game with 
Governor General Martial Asselin at the local Royal Club) on 
time. 
  The president will arrive at 0930 today at the Sanford 
airport in Maine. There he will be met by his "close" friend 
George Bush (concerning Clinton, Menem on 22 June noted that he 
and Clinton are "from the same continent"); Bush's wife, 
Barbara; and Granillo Ocampo. Menem will travel with daughter 
Zulemita; his personal doctor, Alejandro Tfeli; and his private 
secretary, Ramon Hernandez, aboard a private jet loaned by an 
unknown U.S. businessman who is a friend of Bush. The 
presidential airplane Tango-01 will go on to Washington with the 
rest of Menem's entourage. 
  Today's agenda already has been completed: Menem will play 
tennis in the morning, have lunch, have some photographs taken 
by journalists, and finally play golf. For dinner, before 
leaving, Menem will contribute a selection of Argentine wines. 
  If everything goes the way he has planned, Menem's only 
disappointment might be that he will not make a stopover in 
Boston. Menem decided to watch the Argentina-Nigeria soccer game 
on television from somewhere in the United States. Otherwise, 
Box No. 134, which has been reserved for Menem, will be occupied 
by Bush and Granillo Ocampo.

  [Text] Buenos Aires Stock Exchange President Julio Macchi 
stated on 22 June that the decline in the value of shares and 
government securities "is not worrisome" since it is linked to 
the generalized slump in stock markets worldwide. 
  Macchi said that he wished "our stock market was an 
exception, but it is really impossible to escape from these 
trends once they take place," adding that he is not greatly 
worried about the current situation. 
  Macchi -- speaking on the radio from Canada, where he is 
accompanying President Carlos Menem as part of his retinue -- 
asserted: "It is the rise in the price of commodities that is 
causing a decline in securities that represent capital and -- 
concurrent with this -- a rise in interest rates." 
  He further stated that this situation may act as a brake on 
the inflow of capital into Argentina, but at the same time, "we 
will have a better exchange balance parity as the dollar loses 
against other currencies and the prices of beef, grain, and oil 
go up." 
  With regard to Menem's state visit to Canada, Macchi said: 
"We have met with businessmen and have come to the conclusion 
that Argentina is now considered a more credible country." 
  He also underlined that Argentina "stands out from other 
countries in the so-called emerging markets as it is more 
attractive for the direct investment of capital."

<F P=106> [Special report for NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS by Luis Torres] </F>
  [Text] Buenos Aires, 22 Jun (NA) -- The 1995 presidential 
race is clearly and definitively under way. This has been 
confirmed by Carlos Menem's concern in achieving the quiet 
approval of the constitutional reform, and by Cordoba Governor 
Eduardo Angeloz's concern in gaining an advantage through the 
unification of the upcoming elections. Angeloz will certainly 
be the UCR [Radical Civic Union] presidential candidate. 
  There are three political directions that can be noticed 
during this World Cup month, and which outline the national 
electoral future. First, Angeloz's Radicals are fully engaged 
in playing a leading role to defeat their probable contenders in 
the party's primaries, such as Senator Fernando De la Rua and 
Deputy Federico Storani. Second, Menem's Peronists are moving 
the chess pieces of the upcoming elections with the goal of 
fully polarizing the people's hopes, thus preventing the run-off 
election system that truly represents a "fearsome hell" for 
them. Third, Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez's Grand Front [FG] 
is actively engaged in probing the spirit of other parties, with 
the goal of forming a broad alliance that will allow it to 
challenge the Peronists. Storani and Peronist Senator Jose 
Octavio Bordon have been included in the FG's immediate plans. 
UCR President Raul Ricardo Alfonsin has been included in the 
FG's future plans. 
  Current politics, and the hide-and-seek game played by many 
leaders who are attempting to hide what is obvious, may be 
interpreted based on these three directions. 
<H5>  The Governors' Silence </H5>
  The president has peevishly imposed upon himself the 
painstaking and severe task of making his most cherished dream 
come true as soon as possible: the approval of a constitutional 
reform that will allow him to become a candidate again. This 
task involves preventing any action that could delay or obstruct 
the Constituent Assembly's progress. 
  Therefore, the attempt to include a clause allowing the 
governors to be reelected without the requirement of resorting 
to provincial conventions was quickly scrapped, after the 
proposal created a controversial atmosphere that threatened to 
spread to the entire Constituent Assembly. The proposal was 
shelved, but not dismissed. Menem, as any other politician, is 
aware of the fact that if a weapon is not of any use today, it 
will probably be useful tomorrow. 
  After spirits were calmed with the removal of this proposal, 
it did not take long before the governors demanded increased 
revenue sharing in the federal tax system. 
  The first to scream blue murder was Economy Minister Domingo 
Cavallo, who believed that his adjustment and stability program 
would be seriously jeopardized by the hopes harbored by the 
governors, led by a "hardliner" like La Pampa Governor Ruben 
Marin. Marin was supported by the Radical Rio Negro Governor 
Horacio Massaccesi. 
  Economy Ministry officials secretly and almost stealthily 
contacted prominent Peronist leaders (Alberto Pierri?), asking 
them to intercede with the Peronist governors. 
  Therefore the presence of Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo 
Duhalde at the Federal Revenue Sharing Commission, with the goal 
of talking with the governors, was not a coincidence. 
  Although no one explained the reason for Duhalde's visit 
last 
Tuesday evening, everyone believes that the Buenos Aires 
governor -- undoubtedly, the most powerful Constituent Assembly 
member -- is attempting to prevent the Peronist governors' 
insurgency over the distribution of the tax cake. Duhalde also 
has the official title of national Justicialist Party [PJ] 
president, which allows him to issue some instructions from the 
high command, like the duty of remaining silent so as not to 
stir up the constitutional reform's internal atmosphere. 
  Although a concealment effort is being made, the explicit 
order is as follows: "In order to win the upcoming elections, 
the economic program must not be touched; if the governors keep 
bothering with the tax issue, everything will go to hell..." 
<H5>  The Radicals' Roar </H5>
  Eduardo Angeloz keeps harping on the need to unify the 
presidential elections, without concealing his goal of making 
full use of the advantages that he may receive in the run-off or 
"ballotage" [preceding word in English] system in the upcoming 
elections. 
  Angeloz's equation is simple: With the "star" governors -- 
"winners" [preceding word in English] like Tucuman Governor 
Ramon Ortega, Santa Fe Governor Carlos Reutemann, and Entre Rios 
Governor Mario Moine -- unable to run for reelection, with the 
resulting accumulation of votes it is better to compete under a 
unified system because the "influence" effect will be minimized. 
  Menem believes quite the opposite, even though he has 
remained silent on this issue. 
  As the Cordoba governor has not noticed any sign of 
solidarity from Alfonsin, he has just talked with Alfonsin in an 
attempt to achieve Alfonsin's commitment to pressure the 
government to achieve the unification of the elections. 
  In a nutshell, Alfonsin told Angeloz that the following 
political and technical problems exist for the unification of 
the elections: 

  -  Menem's presidential term of office would 
have to be extended for six months (from July to December), 
which is specifically banned by the current constitution. The 
1853 Constitution states: "The president and vice president 
will discharge their duties for six years..." 
  -  The governors' 
terms of office would have to be reduced. This would involve 
meddling in the autonomous provincial system, paving the way for 
another highly dangerous meddling: the direct reelection of the 
"winners" or "star" governors. 

  It is being said that Alfonsin will "not move a single 
finger" to promote the unification of the elections unless the 
entire UCR leadership specifically asks him to do so through a 
document signed and certified, in order to prevent "poor" 
memories later. 
  Alfonsin is actually attempting to have his party understand 
that it must not spend any effort on these elections, but wait 
for the possibility of achieving alliances or preparing to 
regain power by the turn of the century, in 1999. 
  Thus far, Alfonsin is keeping -- at any price -- the UCR 
presidency, a privileged position for reaching agreements and 
devising future strategies.

  [Text] The Radical Civic Union [UCR] has adhered to the 
Federal March, a mobilization that has been called by labor 
sectors to protest over the official economic policy. It will 
be preceded by four regional marches that will end in Plaza de 
Mayo on 6 July. 
  The decision was announced on 22 June by Cordoba Provincial 
Governor Eduardo Angeloz, who heads the UCR's Political Action 
Commission. 
  The UCR's adhesion, which politically strengthens the labor 
sector's call, was preceded by support from some internal 
sectors of the UCR -- like the Convergence Sector, headed by 
Federico Storani and Juan Manuel Casella; the Centennial 
Athenaeum faction, headed by Jesus Rodriguez; and the Radical 
Youth. 
  The decision announced by Angeloz has the support of UCR 
President Raul Alfonsin, who is represented by Leopoldo Moreau 
on the Political Action Commission. 
  The Cordoba provincial governor explained that the UCR 
"adheres to and calls upon the people" to join the march because 
"there is a legitimate demand by a society that has been crushed 
by the economic debacle." 
  The Grand Front and the Social Unity also adhere to the 
Federal March. The main leaders of these groups participated 
last week in a meeting with the labor leaders that head the 
mobilization: Victor De Genaro of the Congress of Argentine 
Workers (CTA), and Juan Manuel Palacios and Saul Ubaldini of the 
Argentine Workers Movement (MTA). 
  Cordoba (From our bureau) -- The Federal March will 
apparently not have massive support in Cordoba. 
  The caravan coming from the northwest, which has been 
organized by state workers of that region, will pass through 
this city on the night of 4 July. 
  A leader of the Union Liaison Board, which coordinates all 
Cordoba Province labor sectors, told CLARIN that it will 
formally adhere to the march next week. Notwithstanding, the 
degree of commitment to the march by members of the board, which 
was created on the eve of the 10 June general provincial strike, 
fluctuates. 
  The local leaders of the CTA, which is one of the organizers 
of the Federal March, sounded out the possibility of launching 
another general strike on 4 July. Their colleagues from the CGT 
[General Confederation of Labor] Chacabuco faction, especially 
those who belong to the Labor Organization and Action Movement 
(MOAS), refused to go along. The Union Liaison Board on 22 June 
decided to invite other intermediate organizations to join the 
demonstration against the economic policy. 
  The weight of the mobilization will basically fall on the 
Sanitary Works Union, the ATE (State Workers Association), and 
the Printers Union, which are all grouped in the CTA, and on the 
leftist political organizations. Other sectors of the Cordoba 
provincial labor movement, which have an ample majority, will 
only give their formal support.

  [Text] Panama has ordered the freezing of bank accounts and 
properties of the Haitian and Libyan Governments in this country. 
  The decision was adopted in compliance with resolutions the 
UN Security Council has taken against the military officers who 
overthrew Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and against 
Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, who is accused of promoting 
terrorism. 
  The Foreign Ministry decrees enable Attorney General Jorge 
Valdes to "immediately" order the freezing of Libyan and Haitian 
military funds. 
  The Foreign Ministry measure regarding Haiti also prohibits 
the Haitian military from entering Panama and bars exports and 
imports to and from that country. 
  President Guillermo Endara's government has also banned 
Panamanian airplanes from flying to Haiti. 
  These UN measures were adopted in order to restore democracy 
in Haiti and reinstate deposed President Aristide. 
  Concerning Libya, in addition to ordering the freeze on 
funds 
and properties of that Arab government or companies, Panama has 
prohibited the sale of equipment the al-Qadhdhafi regime could 
use for oil exploration.

<F P=106> [Report by Jose Quintero de Leon] </F>
  [Text] Haitian Charge d'Affaires George Barberousse has 
informed LA PRENSA that the policy of Haiti's constitutional 
government is that any arrangement with the ruling Haitian 
military hierarchy must remain within the framework of the 
Governors Island Agreement. 
  Barberousse referred to the exile offer extended by 
President 
Bill Clinton to the regime headed by Lieutenant General Raoul 
Cedras, whereby its leaders would not be victimized or 
prosecuted. 
  The diplomat explained that President Jean-Bernard Aristide 
has agreed to grant political amnesty, but that common crimes 
would not be covered by this. He stressed that common crimes 
must be resolved under common law. 
  With regard to whether or not Haiti's powerful economic 
class 
has offered the military hierarchy bribes to leave the country, 
Barberousse said that although this sector would be interested 
in stabilizing the situation, it is also a fact that they 
sponsored the coup d'etat against Aristide. If they were to 
make such an arrangement, it would be among themselves, he said. 
  Regarding the problem posed by the 150 undocumented Haitians 
who are currently in Panama, and to whom the Directorate of 
Immigration has granted permits to remain in Panama while their 
return to Port-au-Prince is being arranged, Barberousse said the 
embassy has not yet received an official statement from the 
Panamanian Government. 
  Nevertheless, Barberousse expressed concern over the 
situation this group of Haitians will face. They will not be 
allowed to work and will not be provided with the means to 
survive. Under these conditions, he said, they could easily 
become the victims of crime. 
  Barberousse commented on one aspect of the remarks made by 
Immigration Director Antonio Dominguez, who banned the Haitians 
from practicing voodoo. 
  "I believe there is certain evidence of cultural 
insensitivity," said the charge d'affaires, who pointed out that 
all peoples have their own values, idiosyncrasies, cultures, and 
religions, and to deny a people these things is intolerable. 
Barberousse defended the Haitian ancestral religion as one of 
his people's values, just as Catholicism, Buddhism, and other 
religions reflect other values. 
  It is a religion that is also a way of life and deals with 
relations between humans and God; it has positive as well as 
negative aspects, and the former outweigh the latter. 
Barberousse added that the negative aspects have been exploited 
by foreigners who go to Haiti to attempt to resolve their 
problems. 
  Meanwhile, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino 
announced yesterday that his office is trying to make 
arrangements for the 150 undocumented Haitians to return to 
their country on flights coordinated by the national government. 
  Mulino pointed out that since COPA flights will be suspended 
on 26 June, arrangements are being made to schedule two flights 
before that date. 
  "If, for some reason, a group is unable to get seats on the 
scheduled COPA flights, we could do what we have done in the 
past -- in other words, issue permits for one or two more 
flights to return to Haiti those left behind," he said. 
  According to the foreign minister, this procedure would not 
constitute a violation of international laws governing the 
matter. 
  "My interest," Mulino underscored, "is to return these 
people 
to their country of origin, because in Panama we have enough 
unemployment and security problems of our own, and we do not 
have the economic capability to maintain all of them, even 
though their reasons for fleeing their country are justified."

<F P=106> [Article by Daymira Barriga Velarde: "Poverty Is Ours, and </F>
It Is Widespread"; first two paragraphs are editorial 
introduction] 
  [Text] An official report states that somewhat more than 
two thirds of the total population of Bolivia live in poverty. 
  About 37 percent of Bolivian families live in extreme 
poverty, 33 percent under conditions of moderate poverty, 13 
percent are at the threshold of poverty, and barely 17 percent 
have their basic needs satisfied. This is the official picture 
of poverty in Bolivia, described in the "Mapa de la Pobreza" 
[Map of Poverty], prepared by the Unit for the Analysis of 
Social Policies (UDAPSO), the National Institute of Statistics 
(INE), the Population Policy Unit (UPP), and the Unit for the 
Analysis of Economic Policies (UDAPE). 
  Social inequalities in Bolivia are extensive, as extensive 
and dramatic as the poverty in which about 70 percent of the 
people of Bolivia live, or rather more than two thirds of the 
population. Meanwhile, more than one half million, or 640,000 
people, are on the threshold of poverty, and only 17 percent of 
the Bolivian people, somewhat more than one million, are not 
poor. 
  Bolivia is not a country of beggars, as someone once defined 
it in a disparaging way. However, these data prove that the 
majority of the population of Bolivia, or 4.5 million people, 
live at an atrocious level of poverty. This is a high figure for 
this country, whose population was estimated at 6.4 million in 
1992. 
<H5>  Details of These Numbers </H5>
  The "Map of Poverty," prepared by UDAPSO, INE, UPP, and 
UDAPE, illustrates this study on the basis of data from the 
Census of the Population and Housing, which took 1.4 million 
family households as the national total, of which 1.3 million 
live in urban areas and 577,000 live in the countryside. 
  Poverty was measured on the basis of satisfying human needs 
for housing, services and basic needs, education, and health and 
social security. The study stated that the categories of 
housing, services, and basic needs relate to the way in which 
the family carries on its life, while education, health, and 
social security are related to the conditions of physical and 
mental development of persons. 
  The study added: "Levels of poverty in Bolivia are high. In 
1992 a considerable proportion of the population, especially in 
rural areas, did not have its essential needs satisfied, as it 
did not have adequate access to such services and basic needs as 
education, health services, and housing." 
<H5>  Poor As Anyone </H5>
  In 1992, 69.8 percent of the 1.4 million families surveyed 
were poor. This represents 70.5 percent of Bolivia's population, 
that is, 4.5 million out of 6.4 million people. 
  In the rural area, poverty affected 94 percent of all homes, 
or 2.3 million people living in 542,644 families. In the urban 
area poverty affected 51 percent of all homes, or 380,886 
families -- rather more than 1.7 million people. 
  According to these data, poverty was more extensive in 
smaller cities than in departmental capitals and in El Alto. 
  The report said: "Living conditions of the Bolivian people 
are, for the most part, poor, since many of the homes lack or 
are inadequately provided with basic cleanliness, living space, 
education, health, energy resources, and household equipment." 
  It continued: "About 74 percent of the homes do not have 
adequate water and sanitation and/or facilities for the disposal 
of human wastes. About 69 percent of the people live in 
overcrowded conditions. Some 66 percent show signs of 
educational shortcomings in terms of school attendance, years of 
schooling completed, and illiteracy." 
  The report stated: "About 53 percent of the families do not 
take adequate care of their health. Some 53 percent of private 
homes do not have access to electricity and/or an adequate fuel 
to cook with, and 49 percent of the homes are constructed of 
poor quality materials." 
<H5>  Differences Between the Countryside and the Cities </H5>
  The study also brought out that poverty is more extensive 
and 
worse in the countryside, where shortages of facilities, as a 
whole, are significant, although the most immediate needs 
reflect basic standards of cleanliness. 
  About 94 percent of the homes in rural areas do not have 
adequate water and sanitation and/or proper means for the 
disposal of human wastes, as well as access to energy services. 
About 93 percent of the homes do not have access to electricity 
and/or appropriate kind of fuel to cook with. The report, 
entitled, the "Map of Poverty," referred to the fact that some 
84 percent of all rural homes are built with poor quality 
materials. 
  In urban centers the greatest problems involve housing 
space. 
About 68 percent of families live in overcrowded conditions. 
Some 58 percent of homes in urban areas do not have adequate 
provisions for water, sanitation, and/or for the disposal of 
human wastes. About 51 percent of the families show some signs 
of educational deficiency, the report added. 
<H5>  The Census of the Poorest </H5>
  The list of departments in terms of their poverty level is 
headed by Pando, Potosi, and Chuquisaca. Santa Cruz is the 
department with the least poverty, but almost 60 percent of the 
families in that department are poor. 
  The "Map of Poverty" states that in the Department of Pando 
81 percent of the families are poor, compared to 80 percent in 
Potosi, and 77 percent in Beni and Cochabamba. 
  In the rest of the departments about 70 percent of the 
families are poor, with the exception of Santa Cruz, which has 
the lowest incidence of poverty. Some 58 percent of the families 
in that department are poor. 
  Of the four poorest departments three of them -- Chuquisaca, 
Pando, and Potosi -- have a high level of poverty. The report 
adds that poor families in these departments, on the average, 
fail to meet 45 percent of their basic needs in terms of minimum 
living conditions. 
<H5>  Classification of the Poor </H5>
  The social classification of the poor shows that out of all 
Bolivian families -- 1.4 million in all -- about 37 percent live 
under conditions of extreme poverty. About 32 percent of all 
families are destitute, while 5 percent live under conditions of 
marginal poverty. 
  The report prepared by UDAPSO, INE, UDAPE, and UPP said that 
this means that 2.1 million Bolivians live under conditions of 
extreme poverty. Seventy percent of their basic needs are not 
being met in terms of minimum living levels. 
  Furthermore, a large number, or 33 percent of the total 
number of families, live in moderate poverty. That is, something 
more than 1.9 million people, on the average, cover 75 percent 
of their minimum living requirements. 
  On the threshold of poverty are 13 percent of all families, 
or 787,907 people, who satisfy the minimum level of their basic 
needs. Only 17 percent of all families, or 915,593 persons, have 
their basic needs met. These people, on the average, satisfy 55 
percent more than their basic, essential needs. 
<H5>  The Harsh Life in the Countryside </H5>
  The official report states that the majority of families in 
rural areas -- 57 percent in all or 1.4 million people -- live 
under conditions of extreme poverty. About 11 percent, or 
265,118 people, live under marginal conditions. About 26 
percent, or 633,258 people, live under conditions of moderate 
poverty. Only 6 percent, or 118,226 people, are not poor. 
  Within this latter group of people living in rural areas the 
families whose basic needs are met amount to barely 1.9 percent, 
while 4.1 percent of the total number of families are on the 
threshold of poverty. 
  In urban areas the extent of poverty is not as great, the 
study said. 
  About 34 percent of families living in urban areas, or 1.3 
million people, live in moderate poverty. About 28 percent, or 
884,107 people, are in the group whose basic needs are met. Some 
20 percent, or 701,167 persons, live on the threshold of 
poverty. About 13 percent, or 427,970 persons, live in extreme 
poverty. Some 12 percent of the total number of families are 
destitute, and 0.5 percent live on the threshold of being 
destitute.

  [Text] Santiago, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Chilean Foreign 
Ministry has confirmed that the eight Cubans -- six men, one 
woman, and one child -- who had been occupying the Chilean 
Consulate in Havana since 15 June voluntarily left the consulate 
today. 
  This is reported in an official communique disclosed by 
Fernando Reyes Matta, Chilean Foreign Ministry Cultural and 
Information Affairs Department director. 
  The text of the communique states: "Through its Foreign 
Ministry, the Cuban Government has offered guarantees to the 
Chilean Government that these people will not be subjected to 
reprisals because of their illegal entrance into the consulate 
building. It also made assurances that this incident would not 
be used as an aggravating circumstance in any possible pending 
cases that these persons could be prosecuted for." 
  The communique adds: "Before their departure from the 
Chilean 
Consulate, the eight persons handed a declaration to the Chilean 
consul general, Ambassador Patricio Pozo Ruiz, in which they 
state that they are voluntarily leaving the consulate office. 
They also express their gratitude for the treatment they 
received during their stay." 
  The Chilean Government's official declaration concludes by 
stating: "In addition to expressing its satisfaction over the 
resolution of the situation affecting our consular mission and 
the cooperation rendered by Cuban officials, the Foreign 
Ministry wishes to explain that the consulate general offered 
protection exclusively for humanitarian reasons; and therefore 
under no circumstance should this action be interpreted as a 
granting of asylum, which was uncalled for in this case." 
  Chilean President Eduardo Frei and Cuban President Fidel 
Castro had discussed the situation created by the entrance of 
eight Cubans into the Chilean Consulate in Havana during a 
meeting held within the framework of the recent Fourth 
Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena, Colombia. 
  During a news conference, Castro stated that the issue was 
subject to the negotiations undertaken by the foreign ministries 
of the two countries. 
  In Santiago, official Chilean sources had stated that the 
situation could continue because in view of the previous 
occupations of the Belgian and German Embassies, the Cuban 
Government had announced it would not issue exit permits. There 
was hope, however, of finding a solution prior to Cuban Foreign 
Minister Roberto Robaina's visit to Chile, which is scheduled to 
take place in August.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 23 June. 
  The Central Bank's net international reserves increased 
$98.4 
million in May, raising this year's cumulative increase to $728 
million and the total reserve stock to $10.4866 billion. 
(Santiago ESTRATEGIA in Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 10) 
  The Argentine consortiums Techint and Comercial La Plata 
will, along with Lone Star from the United States, participate 
in the construction and operation of a gas pipeline linking 
Mendoza Province, Argentina, with Santiago de Chile through the 
Andean mountain range. The Gasandes company, which is in charge 
of the project, reported that $560 million will be invested in 
the construction of the gas pipeline and assembly of the 
distribution system. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 1720 GMT 22 Jun 94) 
  The Central Bank has reported that the trade balance 
registered a $334.2 million surplus from January through the 
first half of May, the highest such accumulated surplus since 
December 1992, with exports of $3.9001 billion and imports of 
$3.5659 billion. Exports increased 5.6 percent as compared with 
the same period last year, while imports dropped by 1.5 percent. 
The leading exports include $1.5417 billion worth of mining 
products; $720.2 million in agricultural, livestock and sea 
products; and $1.6382 billion in industrial products. (Santiago 
LA TERCERA DE LA HORA in Spanish 8 Jun 94 Economic Section p 1) 
  Miguel Basch, an expert from the University of Chile's 
Economics Department, said that the wealthiest 20 percent of 
Chileans earned 55 percent of the country's total income in 1980 
and 56.9 percent in 1991, while the poorest 20 percent accounted 
for 4.6 percent of national income in 1980, a figure which only 
rose to 4.7 percent in 1991. A poll conducted in 1992 showed 
that the monthly income of the poorest 20 percent was 30,000 
pesos, or $70, in 1987, and 43,500 pesos or $100 in 1992. 
According to official figures over 4 million people are 
considered poor, of which 1.2 million are destitute. (Madrid EFE 
in Spanish 1635 GMT 16 Jun 94)

  [Text] An article published by Miami's EL NUEVO HERALD has 
made accusations in the disturbing case of the narco-cassette 
tapes, according to which drug trafficking groups made donations 
to the campaign of President-elect Ernesto Samper. With the case 
still under investigation, EL NUEVO HERALD added things that 
have not been alleged here in Colombia. 
  In turn, President-elect Ernesto Samper sent the following 
letter to the editors of EL NUEVO HERALD--Messrs. (David 
Lorenz), (Bob Scribford), and (Sandra Keys)--and Roberto Suarez, 
a reporter for THE MIAMI HERALD and EL NUEVO HERALD: 
  Dear Gentlemen: With suprise and indignation I read today 
the report that appeared in EL NUEVO HERALD, according to which 
the U.S. Government has confirmed I received money from the Cali 
Cartel for my electoral campaign. In addition, the report 
presents a totally false story that contains slanderous remarks 
I am not willing to let go unchallenged, not only for the sake 
of my own dignity but for that of all of Colombia. 
  I have never received money from any criminal organization 
to 
fund my political activities, as demonstrated by my campaign 
ledgers. These ledgers show that we carefully monitored the 
origin of campaign funds. 
  As president-elect of all citizens of Colombia, I renounce 
the article published today, and I demand that you correct the 
false information in this report, which damages my honor and the 
honor of my country. 
  [Signed] Yours Truly, Ernesto Samper Pizano

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Paraguay monitored through 23 
June. 
  The National Development Bank, BNF, has reported using an 
Inter-American Development Bank line of financing to grant loans 
to 600 mostly agroindustrial companies. Total loans amounted to 
62.6 billion guaranies. The BNF said that 83 percent of this 
amount was used to finance the purchasing of machinery, 
equipment, and the construction of factory facilities, and that 
17 percent was used as initial operative capital or to implement 
industrial projects. The loans were used to create 90 new 
companies and to enlarge and modernize 510 existing productive 
units. (Asuncion ULTIMA HORA in Spanish 20 Jun 94 pp 12-13) 
  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy announced that the Paraguayan 
Central Bank's net international reserves registered a 
"surprising increase" to $966 million in the first half of June. 
The Central Bank reported that on 13 May total reserves were 
$855.4 million, at the beginning of June reserves climbed to 
$901 million, and that they today stand at $966 million. The 
Central Bank did not explain officially the reasons for the 
sudden increase, but it was reported that some of the causes are 
Brazil's payment of its debt on Itaipu royalties, the entry of 
short- and medium-term foreign capital into the country, and the 
local deposit of Brazilian capital escaping from the uncertain 
electoral climate in Brazil. (Asuncion ABC COLOR in Spanish 21

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with presidential hopeful Javier </F>
Perez de Cuellar by Juan Paredes Castro; in Paris "via 
satellite," date not given] 
  [Text] [Paredes Castro] What is your reaction to the 
numerous statements of support for your candidacy? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] I am deeply grateful to all the national 
Peruvian sectors that have asked me to run for president. In 
addition to being an honor and a distinction, it also 
constitutes a challenge that can only be accepted after a period 
of mature meditation. It is not that I am avoiding this 
political commitment; during my 10 years as UN secretary 
general, I engaged in politics and have witnessed the work of 
eminent politicians. Out of a deep sense of responsibility, I am 
compelled to carefully weigh the pros and cons of this decision. 
Let me assure you, however, that I will inform you very soon 
whether I have decided to run for president. 
  [Paredes Castro] If you run, will it be as an independent or 
for a given party? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] I am, and have always been, a political 
independent. I was a member of the Peruvian diplomatic service 
for nearly 40 years and as such was obliged to be politically 
independent. Being a confirmed democrat, however, I am not 
adverse to political parties. I do not exclude them nor ignore 
them because they have the indispensable duty of guiding the 
people, representing them and defending their interests. 
Political parties are the essence of democracy. Specifically, to 
answer your question, I would choose to be an independent 
candidate. 
  [Paredes Castro] How do you view the country's situation? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] It would take a long time to fully answer 
your question. There have been important improvements in the 
last four years: The country has been reinserted into the 
international economic community, a certain economic stability 
has been achieved, and terrorism has been considerably reduced. 
We are still faced with many serious problems: Increasing 
unemployment, a serious stagnation of our exports, agriculture 
and mining face a difficult situation and, worse still, the 
impoverishment of the majority is increasing. All this 
undermines the success of the current economic model. I wish to 
make it perfectly clear that this is not a question of changing 
our macroeconomic policy which is in line with an almost 
universal trend. I must remind you that while I was the UN 
secretary general in 1990, I helped President Fujimori to 
enforce this policy in Peru. We must avoid becoming fanatical or 
ultra-neoliberal, and especially careful to avoid becoming more 
fanatical than the leaders of the World Bank or the IMF. 
  I believe we must streamline public expenses without 
altering 
the macroeconomic balance; we must increase social spending and 
invest in Peruvian citizens. If we are to safeguard and 
consolidate what has been achieved in economics and in domestic 
security, we must immediately pay heed to our social emergencies. 
  [Paredes Castro] Could you give some examples? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] The first thing that comes to my mind is 
education. To invest in education is to invest in the future. 
Education is the key to sustainable development. Youth should be 
a priority area for upcoming Peruvian administrations: We must 
train for the future, and this starts in schools and 
universities. Preferably we must center our attention on 
teachers. What is the point of building schools if we lack 
teachers? What if the teachers we have available are discouraged 
and poorly paid? Education is, undoubtedly, one of the least 
favored areas in Peru. 
  Decentralization is another concerning issue. The executive 
branch must delegate power at the departmental, provincial, and 
district levels. Mayors elected by the people should have the 
means to undertake the needs of their cities and residents. I 
believe decentralization is the best way to achieve integration. 
  I would also like to mention the need to consolidate basic 
institutions like the judiciary, the Armed Forces, the National 
Police, and the Diplomatic Service, which must adopt their own 
institutional regulations and must refrain from arbitrary 
measures and avoid becoming politicized. 
  [Paredes Castro] How do you assess appeals for a national 
consensus? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] In view of the serious problems affecting 
the country, a national consensus is indispensable. By consensus 
I mean different or opposing national opinions should agree on 
common national objectives. This does not entail a unanimous 
decision or a majority decision. Through negotiations, each 
group should yield something toward a desired general agreement. 
I believe the next president should strive to achieve a 
consensus with Congress and thus solve the serious problems 
affecting the country. The interrelation of the branches of 
government will give Peru lasting stability and the 
governability it needs. Moreover, we should not overlook the 
advantage of consensus among the government, business, and labor. 
  [Paredes Castro] You have mentioned clear electoral rules. 
What do you have in mind? 
  [Perez de Cuellar] We have already reinserted our country in 
international economic circles. We must now reinserted it as a 
democracy at the continental and international level. To achieve 
this we must enforce an impeccable democratic system and an 
irreproachable implementation of human rights. The free 
expression of the will of the people is the basis of democracy. 
If this will is to be undisputed, we must have absolutely clean 
elections with very clear rules of play and absolute guarantees 
of impartiality. This involves the Electoral Court, the Armed 
Forces, and the National Police, which is fulfilling its role of 
safeguarding security through its arduous fight against 
terrorism and drug trafficking. 
  [Paredes Castro] Reports of your candidacy continuously 
appear in the press.... 
  [Perez de Cuellar] Ever since my candidacy was mentioned, I 
have met in Lima and here, in Paris, with numerous fellow 
Peruvians whose ideas and views I have heard with great 
interest. I want to explain, nevertheless, that for the time 
being the only reports and opinions that reflect my thoughts are 
those which I make personally, like in this interview.

  [Excerpt] The Constituent Congress plenum on 15 June 
insisted on its original draft bill that punishes those involved 
in poppy growing with up to 15 years of imprisonment, thus 
minimizing the executive branch proposal for reduced punishment 
for those who own up to one kilogram of poppy seeds. 
  The bill states that those who engage in growing, promoting, 
helping, or financing garden poppy will be punished with 
imprisonment terms no shorter than eight years and no longer 
than 15 years. It adds that if someone is captured with a 
maximum of 100 poppy plants, he will be sentenced to prison for 
no less than two years and no more than eight years. 
  In an effort to justify the bill, Congressman Carlos Ferrero 
Costa (C 90-NM) [Change 90-New Majority] said these details are 
necessary because "one kilogram of garden poppy seeds can 
produce up to 38 kg of poppy." 
  The draft bill adds that those people who are facing trial 
or 
already have been sentenced for this crime will not be granted 
any freedom on bail, parole, probation, redemption of the 
sentence by work or education, remission of the sentence, or 
pardon. 
  Since Congress insisted on its original proposal, the draft 
bill must be promulgated by the Congress president to be 
implemented. [passage omitted]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Peru monitored through 23 June. 
  On 15 June the state obtained $103 million with the auction 
of 38.87 percent of its shares in the Cementos Lima plant. 
Special Privatization Committee President Jesus Zamora termed 
the auction successful, as a good profit was obtained from the 
shares, and because 58.75 percent of the shares went to 
international firms and 41.25 percent to local institutions. 
(Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p A22) 
  The Ministry of Fisheries has obtained a "unprecedented" 
profit of $62 million from its licensing of squid fishing, which 
netted 372,877 metric tons from 1992 to May 1994. A ministry 
source said that the money is being used to build schools and 
health units, to promote a national pacification program, and to 
support the subsistence fishing sector. The ministry awarded the 
squid fishing licenses to Japanese and Korean companies, which 
won the five international bids. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 11 Jun 
94 p A22) 
  The PRC will grant $205 million to Peru, of which $70 
million 
will be invested in oil projects, $16 million will be donated, 
and $20 million will be designed to implement social programs. 
The Bank of China will grant $40 million in financing for 
agricultural projects, and the PRC state corporations $57 
million to implement various projects. This was reported in 
Beijing on 8 June following negotiations between PRC President 
Jiang Zemin and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p A4) 
  On 6 June World Bank expert Juan Quintero reported that the 
bank will grant $400 million during the year to finance various 
projects in Peru. The bank stipulates that one out of three 
projects have to deal with environmental issues, in compliance 
with the principles observed by the bank since 1989. (Lima EL 
COMERCIO in Spanish 7 Jun 94 p A6) 
  The German Government has granted $1.2 million to Peru to 
finance a special program on the preservation, protection, and 
rational use of natural resources within a sustainable 
development scheme. This fund will be earmarked mainly for parks 
and forest reserves located in Madre de Dios, Lambayeque, 
Tumbes, Piura. (Lima LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 16) 
  Democratic Constituent Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama on 
21 Jun held a protocol meeting with Swiss Ambassador to Peru 
Marcus Kaiser. He then reported that his government will grant 
$33 million to Peru to implement social programs for the poorest 
sectors. (Lima Global de Television Network in Spanish 0030 GMT 
22 Jun 94) 
  The trade balance with Argentina has registered a $204.3 
million deficit in 1993, with exports at $18.3 million and 
imports at $222.6 million. Peru exports mining products, which 
have low economic significance, and imports a large quantity of 
agricultural and livestock products. (Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 13 
Jun 94 p A24)

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 23 
June. 
  The automotive industry's export trade grew by 136 percent 
in 
the first quarter of the year as compared with the corresponding 
period in 1993, with earnings totaling $34.3 million. This 
expansion was due mainly to a surge in sales to Argentina of 
cars assembled in Uruguay. There was also an upturn in the 
export figures for the livestock sector, which grew 140 percent 
in the first quarter, with earnings of $29.7 million. The export 
of traditional products, representing 35 percent of the 
country's total exports, recorded the greatest expansion, 
earning $137.1 million. This was due mainly to the upswing in 
the demand for and price of wool. Exports of dirty and 
semiwashed wool grew by 125 percent in volume, reaching 8,670 
metric tons in the first quarter. Exports of meat and meat 
by-products rose by 14 percent, totaling $120 million. Other 
exports, however, which had greatly expanded last year, have so 
far this year recorded a decline. Exports of rice, for example, 
plummeted by 25 percent, while the export of electricity, which 
amounted to $11.3 million in the first quarter of 1993, is 
practically zero due to the drop in Argentine demand. 
(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 9) 
  The Inter-American Development Bank, IDB, announced on 16 
June the approval of a nonreimbursable $1.1 million loan to 
Uruguay for the funding of a program to streamline the General 
Directorate of Taxation, DGI, through the upgrading of its 
administrative information system and the training of its human 
resources. The project seeks to curb tax evasion, improve 
taxpayer services, and boost DGI personnel's productivity. The 
IDB also announced the approval of a $1.05 million loan for the 
National Customs Directorate, to be earmarked for decentralizing 
and reorganizing the administration, training its staff, 
expanding its computerized information service, and updating 
regulations. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 17

  [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Approximately 100 Ecuadoran 
Indians are refusing to leave the cathedral in Riobamba, capital 
of the Andean province of Chimborazo, to protest the state of 
emergency declared in Ecuador on Tuesday. 
  The spokesman for the Curia of Riobamba, a city located 188 
km south of Quito, told EFE that church authorities had allowed 
Indians to spend the night in this church, as well as in others, 
over the past few days. Today, however, the Indians decided to 
formally occupy the cathedral. 
  The spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous, added: "The 
Riobamba Curia supports the Indians, and tomorrow Victor Corral, 
the bishop of the dioceses, will confirm this position upon his 
return from Rome." 
  The Indians began protests on 13 June in most provinces to 
oppose an agrarian law that was sanctioned on that same day, 
calling the law "illegal, racist, and ill-advised." 
  The Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador 
[Conaie] 
and unions grouped under the United Workers Front decided the 
night before to combat the "state of mobilization"jointly, one 
of the elements of the "state of emergency" that was based on 
provisions in the National Security Law. 
  Within this context, the Indians and union members scheduled 
joint marches and demonstrations in the days leading up to a 
general strike called for Tuesday. 
  A Conaie leader said, "We have fallen back to devise new 
strategies," while explaining the virtual nonexistence of 
confrontation with the military, which the state has authorized 
to open roads that have been blocked by the Indians for 10 days.

  [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (AFP) -- The Ecuadoran Court of 
Constitutional Guarantees (TGC) unanimously declared on Thursday 
the unconstitutionality of the controversial Agriculture 
Development Law, which was approved on Monday of last week, 
after which thousands of Indians began blocking roads and 
highways. 
  TGC President Carlos Jaramillo said that on this occasion 
the 
Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court, the first appeals 
court and the definitive court on constitutional matters "will 
not have any pretext to challenge the TGC resolution, because 
this court has six legally appointed members." 
  The leftist Democratic People's Movement (MPD) asked the TGC 
to declare the controversial law unconstitutional. The 
Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie) did 
the same on Tuesday. 
  The resolution is aimed at totally suspending the law, which 
was hastily approved by right-wing deputies, as well as by 
deputies from the ruling party, who control the Ecuadoran 
parliament. The law was finally signed by the rightist head of 
state, Sixto Duran Ballen, who is in his seventies. 
  The resolution was handed over to the MPD and Conaie, as 
well 
as to the president. The case documents were also turned over to 
the Constitutional Court of the Supreme Court so that it may 
issue its final ruling, which cannot be appealed. 
  The Indian protests left a total of at least five peasants 
dead, and beginning early Wednesday morning the Army cleared the 
Andean and Amazon highways of the barricades that had been 
erected there, which had paralyzed the country's transportation 
system for 11 days causing a shortage of food in the cities.

  [Text] Legislator Maria Eugenia Lima has asserted that 
three Ecuadoran Indians were killed in clashes with soldiers who 
were enforcing the state of emergency by clearing the country's 
highways. 
  She said that two of the three people were killed when 
soldiers evicted a group of Indians from a Catholic church in 
Guamote, Chimborazo Province, last night. The Guamote church was 
occupied by approximately 100 Indians early this morning. The 
Indians have the support of Victor Corral, the bishop of the 
diocese. 
  Luis Macas, the president of the Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, said that the third death 
occurred when soldiers forced the Indians to return to their 
communities in Tungurahua Province last night. Conaie reported 
last week that three other Indians had been killed by 
paramilitary personnel who work for land owners in Canar 
Province; however, other reports attribute those deaths to 
merchants who charged that their stores had been looted by 
demonstrators. Conaie also reported the first death of an Indian 
in Tungurahua, who was killed by a driver attempting to evade 
the barricades. These events took place 18 hours after the state 
of emergency was declared. In total, seven people have been 
killed. 
  Meanwhile, the Court of Constitutional Guarantees, TGC, 
declared the law unconstitutional and suspended it. TGC 
President Carlos Jaramillo said the six tribunal members had 
unanimously resolved to suspend the law completely because it 
contained flaws of form and substance. The TGC declared the law 
unconstitutional and suspended it. Carlos Jaramillo said that he 
ordered the resolution to be sent immediately to the Supreme 
Court in order for the law to definitely be suspended. 
  Indians have charged that they have been repressed and 
assert 
that they will not quit until the law is repealed. Conaie and 
Episcopal Conference Indians are trying to start a dialogue to 
resolve the crisis started by the agrarian law. Peasant leaders 
have confirmed that they will not end the revolt until the law 
is repealed. 
  [Begin unidentified peasant leader recording] We know that 
eight comrades received blows and were injured in Chimborazo 
Province. We also know that helicopters are bombing Azuay and 
Guayas Provinces. Those are actions against our comrades [words 
indistinct]. We totally reject the mobilization decree, which 
has exacerbated the conflict instead of resolving it. We know 
Article No. 79 of the Constitution stipulates that national 
mobilization can only be decreed in the event of an 
international conflict. [end recording] 
  The Indians also charged that they have been victims of acts 
of aggression by the military and asked that the TGC repeal the 
mobilization decree issued by President Duran Ballen.

  [Text] Luis Trujillo, president of the Chamber of Commerce, 
has said that the blockade, which ended yesterday after the Army 
stepped in, caused losses to agricultural firms because they 
were unable to take their products to markets. Trujillo said: We 
have asked companies to inventory their losses. We can 
anticipate that the economic losses exceed $200 million. 
  Many cities did not have communications for over one week 
during the strike staged by the Confederation of Indian 
Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, to protest the recent approval 
of the agrarian reforms law. The blockade caused lack of food 
supplies in some cities and it led to clashes between 
demonstrators and residents who were affected by the blockade. 
As a result of these clashes, four people were killed and 10 
were wounded. 
  Trujillo says there is concern among businessmen about the 
losses they have sustained. We want to make sure the country has 
the necessary guarantees to allow the companies to operate, he 
said. 
  President Sixto Duran Ballen, who declared a state of 
military emergency on Tuesday to quell the Indian 
demonstrations, said the Army will stay on the streets. We will 
maintain troop mobilization as long as necessary, Duran Ballen 
told newsmen. Duran Ballen said that the Army reopened highways 
where many people were trapped for several days and that the 
public forces had truly reestablished the flow of vehicles. 
  The president said it is necessary to maintain the state of 
militarization because of the threat by several organizations 
joining the Indian movement. The president said that other 
organizations had announced strikes in support of the Indians. 
  The country's largest labor organization has called for a 
general 24-hour strike this coming Tuesday to support the Indian 
protest movement. The United Workers Front, FUT, called a strike 
to demand that the government meet the demands of the workers, 
the Indians, and peasants. A FUT communique says it demands the 
repeal of the agrarian law, among a list of demands to improve 
the living standards of the people. 
  President Sixto Duran Ballen said the law cannot be 
repealed, 
because it was approved by the executive and legislative 
branches jointly and its elimination would leave all 
agricultural activities without a regulation framework. 
  Conaie President Luis Macas said the Indian organizations 
will continue to protest the new law, which they consider 
harmful to their interests. According to several Indian 
organizations, the new law eliminates agrarian reform 
achievements and authorizes the government to confiscate 
properties currently held by Indian to turn them over to wealthy 
landlords.

  [Text] The Democratic Left party is requesting a sincere 
dialogue between Indians and the government. The Democratic Left 
has criticized the government and the Social Christian Party on 
the agrarian law. The Democratic Left says the country currently 
is in a situation of increasing violence, which leads to a 
delicate security situation. The Democratic Left says that the 
agrarian law should be repealed in order to pave the way for a 
sincere dialogue. 
  [Begin recording of unidentified speaker] I want to say that 
the Democratic Left warned well in advance of the danger of 
imposing on the Indians, who are our fellow countrymen, a bill 
benefiting the traditionally privileged groups, who are 
represented in this case by Agriculture Minister Mariano 
Gonzalez. We think it is time for the government to seriously 
consider the measures it has adopted and to find adequate 
channels for restoring tranquillity in the country. [end 
recording] 
  The Democratic Left has stated its support of the 
Confederation of Indian Nationaliaties of Ecuador. It does not 
agree, however, with the violence and acts of vandalism promoted 
by some Indians in the Ecuadoran mountain provinces.

<F P=106> [Interview with Luis Felipe Duchicela, National Secretary </F>
for Indian Affairs and Ethnic Minorities, in Guayaquil; date not 
given: "Above the Differences"] 
  [Text] Duchicela intends to seek Indian unity. "I have good 
friends within the Indian leadership, such as Luis Macas, 
Bolivar Tapuy, and Ampam Karakras," the new government official 
declared. 
  Guayaquil -- "The fact that we are descendants of royalty 
was 
not the reason the government sought us out," Luis Felipe 
Duchicela Shyri XXVIII, the recently appointed National 
Secretary of Indian Affairs and Ethnic Minorities, told HOY as 
he gave our newspaper a detailed explanation of the policy he 
proposes to follow as head of that secretariat. 
  "I shall carry out a policy that is not linked to any 
political sector, religious or political," he said. "I shall 
seek the welfare of the Indian sector and of the nation in 
general. My policy will be to work hard in behalf of the Indian 
population, and to coordinate projects and efforts with the 
other cabinet ministries and governmental and nongovernmental 
institutions -- such as foundations -- with a view to 
implementing this program in the Indian sector." 
  He emphasized that his secretariat will make certain that 
the 
resources allocated by the government for projects in the Indian 
sector will actually reach those who most need them. 
  "At the same time," he added, "we shall succeed in 
strengthening our nation's credibility in the eyes of the 
international institutions that provide financing for social and 
economic development." 
  The interview was conducted as follows: 
  [HOY] Do you acknowledge that there is disunity in the 
Indian 
sector? 
  [Duchicela] Definitely. That is precisely why the guiding 
principle of the Secretariat will be to avoid politicization or 
capture by this or that political movement, and instead to 
remain above politics and above the doctrines that the various 
religious sects are imposing on the Indian population. 
  [HOY] How can the unity of the Indian sector be achieved? 
  [Duchicela] That will be our principal objective. We shall 
propose the following to the Indian organizations: Let us sit 
down and talk, and let us identify those areas in which we can 
get to work immediately. 
  [HOY] But will some sectors say "no" to you? 
  [Duchicela] It is only natural that a problem as complex as 
the Indian problem will involve some areas in which we shall 
initially be unable to reach an agreement. I believe, however, 
that President Duran Ballen definitely wants to make this 
secretariat function efficiently, and that above all else he is 
seeking unity and positive results. 
  [HOY] Do you believe the government has the political will 
to 
implement these changes that you are proposing? 
  [Duchicela] I believe so. The government has successfully 
established a policy of macroeconomic stabilization, and I 
believe it is prepared at this time to step in with a strong 
plan and program in the social area. 
  [HOY] Why have these concrete measures been taken in the 
Indian sector? 
  [Duchicela] This secretariat was created precisely in order 
to avoid a situation in which some organization or other would 
have to take de facto measures because no one had paid any 
attention to the Indians or listened to them. With the creation 
of this secretariat, we shall have sufficient time to take such 
measures. 
  [HOY] Many have expressed the opinion that you were 
appointed 
to carry out a symbolic social policy for the government. What 
is your opinion in this regard? 
  [Duchicela] I believe these interpretations are not correct. 
  [HOY] There has been speculation concerning the reasons why 
the government chose someone such as yourself who is not 
necessarily active in the Indian sector. What is your response? 
  [Duchicela] Because of the disunity within the Indian 
community, the government had great difficulty finding someone 
who could remain above all this; hence my appointment. 
  [HOY] But why Luis Felipe Duchicela? Why not someone fron a 
tribe, from the Conaie [National Commission for Indian Affairs], 
or from the Cofanes? 
  [Duchicela] The Indian problem cannot be managed efficiently 
at the governmental level by someone who is not equipped with 
the administrative and technical tools used in the areas of 
finance, human resources, and systems. Why is this so? Because a 
secretariat is an executive entity. We will be coordinating 
projects. As we go forward, we will be interested in getting 
results rather than in making speeches. 
  [HOY] But don't we need someone who understands the reality 
of Indian life? 
  [Duchicela] Of course we do. In that connection I believe 
the 
press has not been very accurate, perhaps because they have not 
been informed about my career and do not know about it. 
  [HOY] Haven't some people said that you sought this 
appointment in order to focus attention on your royal ancestry? 
  [Duchicela] Although it is true that we are very proud of 
our 
ancestry, we are prouder of our Indian roots and our culture 
than of being "noble," because we are modern persons. We have 
never proposed that we be conceded anything, or granted 
anything, merely because we are descendants of the ancient 
Shyris. This is because we have earned everything we possess 
through our own efforts. My grandfather was an Indian who 
emigrated from Caccha to Guayaquil -- as hundreds of Indians did 
-- and I had the good fortune to excel intellectually and to 
progress. As a result, I was the first Ecuadoran to be hired as 
an attorney by Chiquita Brands in Ecuador; in its 60 years of 
existence, all of the company's attorneys had been gringos. We 
must give the community something in return for the progress 
that we have made as professionals; that is the way we can show 
how we feel and give something in return. The fact that we are 
descendants of royalty was not the reason the government sought 
us out. 
  [HOY] Some columnists have wondered how this secretariat 
could possibly be entrusted to someone who among other things 
lives in a residential district of Guayaquil such as Urdesa. 
What is your interpretation of this evaluation? 
  [Duchicela] This is one of the mental chains that has to be 
broken. The columnist in question is saying that this post must 
be given to an Indian who was born and raised in the Sierra. But 
what does this mean? Does it mean that we Indians who after one 
or two generations have been able to get an education, rise to 
another level, and excel in the world of the white mestizos have 
ceased to be Indians? This is precisely what we wish to combat. 
  [HOY] Have you encountered any resistance from the Indian 
sector? 
  [Duchicela] No. I do not think so. I have not heard of any. 
What Conaie said was that they opposed the action because the 
secretariat would be just one more bureaucratic jurisdiction and 
would prove to be an obstacle to communication with the 
government. I say that is not what is going to happen. 
  [HOY] Haven't some people said that you are an unknown in 
the 
Indian movement? 
  [Duchicela] Although it is true that I have lived these past 
11 years in Panama, Costa Rica, and Honduras, I have always kept 
in close touch with our community of Caccha in Chimborazo. 
  [HOY] What was your background before the appointment that 
you are pointing to with pride? 
  [Duchicela] During my university years, instead of going to 
parties or soccer matches I went to the Indian communities, 
where I made many friends among the peasant leaders of that 
time. Some of them are top leaders today, such as Luis Macas, 
who has been my friend since we were fellow students at the 
university; Bolivar Tapuy, who is deputy for Napo; Anpam 
Carakras; Sharine Shiguango, who has been named to a post in the 
Ministry of Social Welfare; and others. We worked together with 
them, and in those days I came to know the Indian reality. My 
degree thesis dealt with the reality of the Indian peasants of 
the Sierra and involved a study of the various forms of material 
development in the sector.

  [Text] Quito, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The top 14 executives of 
Banco de los Andes, including its chairman, Rear Admiral 
Guillermo Duenas (retired), and its attorney [procurador], 
Chilean Gonzalo Huidobro, were arrested for alleged ties to the 
"laundering" of properties from drug trafficking. The two were 
jailed a few hours ago, the local news media have reported. 
  Duenas, owner and chairman of the bank board of directors, 
is 
allegedly linked to the "laundering" of properties of more than 
20 members of the Reyes family, Pichincha Police Superintendent 
Boanerges Villagomez confirmed today. 
  According to the police, the so-called group "Three Magi" 
[Los Tres Reyes Magos], headed by wealthy businessman Victor 
Hugo Reyes, who is under arrest, was the only organization with 
the characteristics of a "cartel" in Ecuador and was dismantled 
two years ago. The Reyes family has been facing drug trafficking 
charges since then. 
  At least a dozen people, including certain retired officers 
and executives of a local airline, have been charged with these 
offenses. 
  According to Ecuadoran law, any offense related to 
trafficking or "laundering" of money obtained through the 
illicit drug trade brings with it imprisonment for the accused 
until found innocent. 
  The charges against Duenas are based on a report by a 
special 
congressional commission, the police, and the Bank 
Superintendency, which also ordered the imprisonment of Huidobro. 
  Duenas was arrested a few hours ago in the main building of 
his bank in Quito during a discreet operation that involved 
uniformed and plainclothes policemen. In a statement from the 
Provisional Detention Center, Duenas said that his arrest "is 
illegal and unjustifiable" and that he will give fuller details 
in the coming hours. 
  Bank Superintendent Ricardo Munoz has asked the bank's 
170,000 customers to remain calm, because "neither the bank's 
solvency nor immediate liquidity is adversely affected by the 
arrests." Banco de los Andes has $72.5 million in deposits and a 
portfolio estimated at more than $85 million. "The 
investigations," he said, "are directed at events that occurred 
from 1989 to 1990, and so the bank's current status is not at 
risk." He added "there should not be a run on the country's 
banks, because the Ecuadoran financial system is solid and 
handled with great professionalism and seriousness." 
  According to Munoz, Rear Admiral Duenas had charged 
investigations were not conducted by order of Congress but, 
rather, based on exigencies of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration [DEA] and the U.S. Embassy. News reports have 
stated Duenas also owns at least 52 companies in different 
sectors, magazines, television production companies, advertising 
agencies, and shares in several Ecuadoran newspapers.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] The Chamber of Deputies has agreed to condemn 
unanimously any U.S. military intervention in Haiti. In addition 
to condemning any unilateral or multilateral military 
intervention, through the agreement approved by the Chamber, the 
lawmakers also decided to reject pressure from the United States 
to receive quotas of Haitian refugees. The lawmakers also 
demanded an end to the economic blockade on Haiti because they 
believe it affects the innocent population instead of the 
government. 
  Deputy Herman Monzon, chairman of the Lower Chamber Foreign 
Policy Commission, gives more details about this decision: 
  [Begin Monzon recording, broadcast in progress] ...to 
condemn 
the possibility of an intervention in Haiti by the U.S. An 
intervention of this nature would be a costly operation and it 
would involve the possibility of loss of human lives and 
material losses. 
  I would recommend this money be used to develop Haiti. This 
is an historic juncture. Venezuela must once more assume 
leadership in Latin American to restore legitimacy in Haiti and 
to support the Haitian people. The Haitian people need the help 
of the entire international community. [end recording] 
  In addition, Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas 
reiterated that so far our country has not received an asylum 
request from Haitian refugees. The foreign minister made these 
statements when leaving Congress after a summons by the Foreign 
Policy Commission regarding Haitian refugees. When asked about 
the number of Haitians who would enter the country, the foreign 
minister, who was visibly disturbed, said the following: 
  [Begin Burelli recording] You want me to say no flatly. 
Obviously, a country that received assistance from Haiti at a 
historical moment cannot say no. But we will only receive those 
we deem convenient. The three, four, or five Haitians who will 
help us investigate specific nuclear problems in Haiti will 
come, just like Manigat and his wife did. 
  But for heaven's sake, stop speculating that 150,000 
Haitians 
will come in planeloads or shiploads. Such speculations are 
ill-intended. I said here many times that only 35 Haitians have 
reached the U.S. ships off the coast of Jamaica. Of these, only 
six Haitians qualified for asylum and 29 others were returned. 
Just imagine, we will assess these cases in our embassy in 
Washington, and the ambassador will call here or send us a note 
when a Haitian who wants to go to Venezuela gets to the embassy. 
[end recording] 
  Finally, the foreign minister reiterated that the United 
States has not pressured our country to accept Haitian refugees.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli has strongly 
criticized the Argentine Senate's statement on the legal 
proceedings of the trial of former Venezuelan President Carlos 
Andres Perez. Burelli believes the Argentine parliament has no 
right to interfere in Venezuelan affairs. Vicente Briceno 
reports: 
  [Briceno] As the foreign minister left the special Council 
of 
Ministers meeting at Miraflores Palace, he said the branches of 
the Venezuelan Government have properly handled the case of 
former President Perez. Despite the Argentine Senate's 
statement, he said Venezuela will not break relations with the 
Argentine Government, because the Senate issued that statement, 
not the executive branch. He also said Venezuela will not send a 
protest note to Argentina, because the Venezuelan diplomatic 
delegation in that country handles these types of statements by 
expressing regret over them. 
  [Begin Burelli recording] The government branches have 
seriously and flawlessly handled Perez's case. Congress, in its 
own right, and the judicial branch have intervened in the case, 
thus allowing the former president to enjoy the rights to which 
he is entitled. The process has been so impeccable that Perez's 
own party had expelled him as the judicial branch made a 
decision. The Venezuelan Senate and state would never dare give 
opinions on decisions that foreign governments have made. [end 
recording] 
  [Briceno] Burelli again broached the controversial case of 
the Haitians who will reportedly be granted asylum in Venezuela, 
a case which has triggered opposing opinions in the executive 
cabinet. He has said that only those Haitians whom the 
government has approved will be granted asylum and that our 
embassy will select them. The exact number of these Haitians has 
yet to be determined, however.

<F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast] 
  [Text] Defense Minister General Rafael Montero Revette this 
Thursday rejected rumors of a new coup attempt in the country. 
In this regard, he said the unequivocal task within the military 
organization is to work for Venezuela, adding that that is why 
there is no talk about military rebellion within the Armed 
Forces. Montero also indicated that those implicated in the 4 
February and 27 November 1992 coup attempts were pardoned and 
some of them reinstated in the Armed Forces. 
  Admitting that the country's situation is difficult, General 
Francisco Visconti, one of the leaders of the 27 November 1992 
coup attempt, said that the conditions for a new coup in 
Venezuela do not exist. The high-ranking military officer, whose 
case was dismissed in exchange for his discharge from the Armed 
Forces, was received by President Caldera, whom he thanked for 
the peace process implemented in the military. Wearing the 
typical blue Air Force uniform with his brigadier general rank, 
Visconti asked the president to ensure that the aeronautics 
experience of the high-ranking officers who will retire 5 July 
be used in the most efficient and productive manner for the 
country. 
  Admitting that the country's crisis is deep, the coupist 
military officer asked for a vote of confidence for the 
president, whom he described as a man with the morals and 
professionalism to lead Venezuela. He added that this task 
cannot be carried out by only one person, rather a highly 
qualified human team. 
  [Begin Visconti recording] We have said that this is a very 
difficult task, which requires our cooperation. Consequently, 
the commitment is not to Dr. Caldera but to ourselves, 
Venezuelans, and our fatherland, which must overcome the 
existing crisis. [end recording] 
  Although he thinks that commander Hugo Chavez Frias has the 
right to make proposals, Gen. Visconti said that he will not 
constantly criticize the administration as Chavez has been doing.

<F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>
  [Text] The government does not take responsibility for the 
financial crisis the nation is experiencing, because, according 
to Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, OCI [Central Information Office] 
director, the Executive Branch does not have a major say in 
decisions made by the Banking Superintendency and the Central 
Bank of Venezuela. 
  In his statements, which were motivated by the proposed 
censure vote against Finance Minister Julio Sosa, Alvarez 
Bajares said that the responsibility falls on the Congress, 
because the government's legal actions, which are very well 
defined, exclude it from making such decisions. Regardless of 
whether the parliament approves the appointment, it is the 
president who appoints candidates to head these organizations. 
  In the opinion of the OCI director, government officials are 
not implementing decisions of the Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking Protection Fund], Banking Superintendency, and Central 
Bank of Venezuela. As a result, contradictions appear in each of 
these institutions. He admitted that the situation is difficult 
to manage. Even though the decision to subsidize the banks was 
made at a cabinet meeting and subsequently sent to the Congress 
for its approval, Alvarez Bajares insisted that the problem 
belongs to the political parties that approved the subsidies and 
now criticize the situation. 
  [Begin Alvarez Bajares recording] Except for the [words 
indistinct] management problem it has inherited and its attempts 
to mitigate the resulting social effects, the government has 
little responsibility for management as far as a decisions made 
on specific issues are concerned. The government does not manage 
monetary policy, it does not manage the amount of subsidies 
granted to banks, and it does not manage or control bank 
operations. 
  The OCI minister reiterated that the government does not 
necessarily agree with policies adopted until now; it is just 
the contrary. The government objects to the high interest rates, 
among other things, but this policy is not the responsibility of 
the Finance Ministry, he noted.

<F P=106> [Report by Cecilia Cayone; from the "Union Radio News" </F>
newscast; passages within quotation marks recorded] 
  [Text] Noris Aguirre, president of the Deposit Guarantee 
and Banking Protection Fund [Fogade], has reiterated that 
beginning today, banking institutions such as Bancor [Banco 
Nororiental de Venezuela], La Guaira, and Amazonas will begin 
paying depositors up to 100,000 bolivares upon presentation of 
their bankbook. Here is Cecilia Cayone with a report: 
  [Cayone] Noris Aguirre made this statement after she was 
summoned by the congressional Finance Commission regarding the 
granted financial assistance. Aguirre had said only depositors 
in Caracas will be paid today. 
  [Begin recording] [Aguirre] Only offices in Caracas will 
make 
payments while offices in the interior will begin payments 
tomorrow. Concerning Banco Amazonas, its Caracas offices will 
open at 1400. 
  [Cayone] Will payments be made only upon presentation of a 
bankbook [word indistinct]? 
  [Aguirre] Yes. Payments will only be made in this manner. 
[end recording] 
  [Cayone] Meanwhile, Deputy (Jorge Roy) has said the Radical 
Cause Party will file criminal charges in the coming days 
against the Finance Ministry, the Banks Superintendency, and 
Fogade, because that party believes the granted financial 
assistance violates the General Banking Law. 
  [Begin (Jorge Roy) recording] All financial assistance that 
has been granted in the past days must comply with Article 314 
of the Banking Law, no exceptions. Article 314 clearly 
stipulates that no financial assistance can surpass the total 
amount, whatever it may be, which Fogade collected during the 
previous year or the previous two semesters. Fogade never 
collected more than 100 billion bolivares in 1993; therefore, 
the granted financial assistance should not have surpassed 200 
billion bolivares. 
  We asked Aguirre about this issue today, and she said she 
should have an answer ready by tomorrow, because her lawyers are 
studying the case. We are totally convinced this financial 
assistance is illegal, because it should have never surpassed 
100 billion bolivares. As soon as we have Aguirre's report, we 
will proceed to file the corresponding charges. [end recording]

  [Text] At 1530 on 23 June, all the people who had been 
staying at the Chilean Consulate unconditionally left. Likewise, 
53 of the people who stayed in the Belgian ambassador's 
residence have returned to their homes after ending their 
illegal and irresponsible action. Right now, the German Embassy 
is still occupied by 21 people, and another 72 remain at the 
Belgian Embassy. 
  All of them have this option: Abandon your irresponsible 
plan 
or condemn yourslves to remain for life under a roof which will 
be a voluntary cell. 
  No one will attain, at any time, authorization to emigrate 
through violence and violation of Cuban laws and international 
legislation. Those citizens wishing to leave Cuba for diverse 
reasons which range from family, personal, and economic matters, 
to simple adventure, have been the object of a clumsy political 
manipulation, which is condemned to complete failure like all 
those contrived in over three decades of ravenous efforts 
against the Cuban Revolution. 
  The Cuban authorities, as a goodwill gesture toward the 
nations with which it maintains diplomatic and friendly 
relations, have extended every recourse to the representatives 
of the embassies involved to solve the conflict in which they 
have found themselves entangled. Repeating: Only through work, 
intelligence, serenity, and intransigence can incidents of this 
nature be avoided and discouraged in the future.

  [Text] Havana, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Cuban State security has 
summoned several human rights activists for questioning on their 
alleged cooperation with those individuals inside the residence 
of the Belgian ambassador in Havana, a dissident source said 
today. 
  Among those summoned to "Villa Maristas," which is the 
general headquarters of Cuban State security in Havana, are 
Elizardo Sanchez and Vladimiro Roca, both members of the 
"Democratic Socialist Current," and Jesus Yanes Pelletier of the 
"Cuban Human Rights Committee." 
  The dissident source explained they had been summoned by 
authorities for questioning on their alleged connection with the 
Cubans occupying the Belgian diplomatic mission. The source, 
however, affirmed they do not know those who are inside the 
Belgian diplomatic mission, adding that they could be 
independent human rights activists.

  [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 Jun (EFE) -- The Dominican 
Government warned today it will not allow the presence of 
foreign troops in its territory to reinforce the embargo against 
the Haitian military. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Fabio Herrera Cabral told EFE: "In 
no 
way will we (the Dominican Government) accept foreign troops in 
order to reinforce the border." 
  The high-ranking official referred to Argentine President 
Carlos Menem's possible offer to send Argentine troops to the 
Dominican border with Haiti to reinforce the blockade against 
the military coupists. 
  Menem will present this proposal during a meeting to be held 
tomorrow in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton, 
according to high-ranking diplomatic sources in Buenos Aires 
quoted by the Buenos Aires daily CLARIN. 
  Fifteen days ago, Argentina became part of the "Friends of 
Haiti Club," which also includes the United States, France, 
Canada, and Venezuela. 
  Herrera said the Dominican Foreign Ministry had no knowledge 
of Menem's proposal and explained that what the Dominican 
Government agreed to with the United Nations -- and "the United 
States is aware of this" -- is the presence of "approximately 20 
observers" who would work together with Dominican authorities. 
The deputy minister added that the mission would consist of 
individuals, including military, of various nations, but he said 
five or six military personnel "cannot be considered a troop." 
  He added: "We do not accept any foreign troops in Dominican 
territory to carry out something that corresponds to a bilateral 
matter. We are not at war with Haiti or anyone" and thus cannot 
accept the presence of military troops on Dominican territory. 
  He explained that the Dominican Government is complying with 
the UN provisions and that it will receive the necessary 
reinforcements, but this will be in advisory and logistical 
support. 
  After saying the Argentine Embassy "in no way" had made 
contact with the Foreign Ministry to discuss the Haitian crisis, 
he said his government had not received the logistical support 
which the international organizations has promised. 
  "We are absorbing the economic cost of maintaining the 
Dominican troops on the border with no assistance, up until now, 
from any international organization," said the deputy minister. 
Nevertheless, he said despite the heavy cost the embargo 
represents for the Dominican Government, his country is still 
guarding the border while the international community's 
sanctions prevail against the "de facto" Haitian Government.

  [Text] This evening, President Armando Calderon Sol 
announced that Rodrigo Avila, deputy operations commissioner of 
the National Civilian Police [PNC], has been designated the new 
PNC director. The president said Avila will be sworn into his 
position on 1 July. In addition, the president disclosed a 
national security plan to effectively fight organized crime. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] The decision regarding the 
appointment of the PNC director has already been made. Rodrigo 
Avila will be the new PNC director, and he works at the PNC and 
will assume his position on 1 July. [end recording] 
  Regarding the security plan, Calderon Sol explained it will 
be jointly implemented by members of the National Police, the 
PNC, and the Armed Forces, which will provide logistical 
cooperation. The president said the deputy security minister 
will be tasked with organizing the security plan. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] The two police corps that 
exist during this transition period will be placed under the 
deputy public security minister. These police corps will have a 
single leader. We believe this reorganization will enable us to 
face crime more effectively. [end recording] 
  Calderon Sol said, however, the security plan will not be a 
success without the people's support; in this regard, he added, 
certain mechanisms have been established. 
  [Begin Calderon Sol recording] We are going to implement 
people's security committees in neighborhoods, cantons, and 
villages; we are also going to organize people at the municipal 
level to permit the participation of organized people. [end 
recording] 
  The president made these statements at a ceremony held on 21 
June commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Central Reserve 
Bank.

  [Excerpts] Mexico City, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari today appointed Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, 
president of the National Human Rights Committee (CNDH), the new 
commissioner for peace and reconciliation in the State of 
Chiapas, which is in southeastern Mexico. 
  Madrazo Cuellar will replace Manuel Camacho Solis, who 
resigned 16 June claiming that his work had been criticized by 
Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, presidential candidate of the 
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party. 
  "The government's purpose has been clear: to transform the 
armed conflict into a political dialogue, which will overcome 
differences," Salinas said upon announcing the appointment of 
Madrazo Cuellar, who will ask the Senate for a leave of absence 
to quit the CNDH. [passage omitted] 
  Salinas said the measures adopted by the government, 
including an amnesty law, a cease-fire, and the creation of the 
post of peace commissioner in January, were to "try to resolve 
within the framework of the law" the demands for dialogue in San 
Cristobal, 780 km southeast of the Mexican capital. 
  "It is not through violence that one achieves democratic 
progress, welfare, and justice. We are committed to having 
Mexico grow in peace, with more justice and sovereignty," the 
Mexican president stated. The government is determined to make 
additional efforts to maintain the dialogue and promote a 
political solution to the conflict, he said. He recognized that 
the political parties are committed to the advancement of 
democracy. 
  Camacho Solis was appointed by Salinas on 10 January to find 
political solutions to the Indian insurrection that broke out on 
1 January in Chiapas. Camacho Solis met with the rebels between 
23 February and 3 March in San Cristobal de las Casas to offer 
solutions to their demands. Despite the cease-fire that has 
been in effect since 12 January, the conflict in Chiapas is at 
an impasse after the Zapatist guerrillas turned down the 
government's offer and ended their dialogue with the government.

<F P=106> [Article by Maria O'Donnell from Ottawa] </F>
  [Text] After signing an agreement on nuclear cooperation 
with Canada, President Carlos Menem announced here that next 
week he will send a bill to Congress asking for approval for 
Argentina to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. "This is 
the only step that is lacking so the country can receive credit 
as a trustworthy country in the world," a diplomatic source 
said, and he explained that the president's promptness is due to 
the fact that the treaty is about to be revised and therefore it 
is the appropriate time for Argentina to sign the document, 
having refused to sign it in the 1970's. 
  The president's promptness also is due to the fact that, as 
a 
UN Security Council member, the Argentine Government told the 
United States that it is willing to support that organization if 
economic sanctions are imposed on North Korea for having 
violated the treaty. If Jimmy Carter's mediation with North 
Korea to get the latter to accept routine inspections of its 
nuclear plants fails, then Argentina would find itself in the 
position of sanctioning the Koreans without having signed the 
treaty. 
  In the 1970's the following countries, in addition to 
Argentina, did not sign the treaty: India, Pakistan, Israel, 
Cuba, and Brazil, although Brazil, like Argentina, signed the 
Tlatelolco Treaty, but it was not willing to sign the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. 
  "The countries that do not sign the treaties are saying that 
they reserve the right to develop nuclear technology for 
non-peaceful means. But we already have changed our position, 
and now we do not want to be left out of the meeting that will 
be held in April to decide whether the treaty, which is for 30 
years, should be extended," the diplomat said. 
  The most important local newspaper, the GLOBE AND MAIL, on 
21 
June on page 2 published an article lauding Menem for signing 
the agreement with Canada and the announcement regarding the 
treaty. Greenpeace [preceding word in English] had another 
interpretation: It organized a small demonstration to protest 
the agreement because the organization says the main objective 
is to pave the way for the sale of the Canadian reactor Candu-3 
to Argentina. "Argentina does not need it because it already 
has one, but construction was postponed due to the lack of 
funds," according to Greenpeace [preceding word in English]. 
"It is evident that Canada is interested in selling the Candu 
to Argentina," admitted Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet.

  [Text] Antidrug "Operation Trebol" was conducted on 23 May 
in Santa Cruz. Three international traffickers organizations 
were dismantled, hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets were 
seized, and 23 presumed traffickers were caught. 
  According to the writ issued on 13 June by the lower court 
of 
controlled substances in La Paz, 15 of the 23 individuals 
arrested have been taken to the maximum security prison in 
Chonchocoro. During the operation 84,500 grams of cocaine were 
seized. 
  Judges Victor Lopez Alcala and Renan Moreno Aviles filed 
against Luis Alberto Arteaga Seleme and Iver Daza Suarez, for 
manufacturing, trafficking, and transporting cocaine. They are 
also accused of illegal association to commit crime and are 
being held at the Chonchocoro prison. 
  The judges also filed against Emilio Arce Vidal, Robin 
Rosales Agreda, Horario Arroyo Bonilla, and Ruddy Yassir 
Pedrazas Suarez. They are accused of manufacturing and 
trafficking cocaine, and of illegal association to commit crime. 
  The following, who are at large, are also accused of the 
same 
crime: Juan Carlos Araoz Antelo, Johnny Lara, Clider Matienzo 
Rodriguez, Victor Rosales Agreda, Johnny Rosales Agreda, 
Fernando Cadario Garrido, Carlos Alfonso Gutierrrez, and Freddy 
Eguez. 
  The antidrug judges also began criminal proceedings against 
Juan Rosales Agreda who is accused of murder, cocaine 
trafficking, and association to commit crime, while Luis 
Fernando Bascope Rivera is accused of cocaine trafficking and 
association to commit crime. 
  The following are accused of the same crime: Alcides Bascope 
Chavez, Wilfredo Rosales Agreda, Pedro Fernandez Barrientos, 
Elvio Cespedes Anez, Mario Antonio Artega Seleme, and Medardo 
Vargas Callau. 
  William Rosales Suarez is accused of participating in 
trafficking and manufacturing of cocaine, and association to 
commit crime. 
  The judges issued an arrest warrant against the eight people 
who are still at large. The Ministry of Government, through its 
specialized organizations, is ordered to catch them. 
  The writ of indictment was forwarded to the La Paz Superior 
Court for approval, according to current legal dispositions. 
  Antidrug judge Justino Ugarte expressed satisfaction over 
the 
2d. Court decision and said the Superior Court must ratify the 
measures. 
  "The Superior Criminal Court must approve the indictment 
issued by the antidrug judges who filed the accusation based on 
evidence of involvement," the criminal prosecutor said. 
  Beside dismantling three trafficking organizations, 
"Operation Trebol" allowed the seizure of assets estimated at 
several hundred thousand of dollars. 
  The following properties were seized in Santa Cruz: 
properties on Mutualista Avenue and Paragua Street, at 605 
Cotoca Canal, at Km 12 of the old highway to Cochabamba, on the 
corner of the third beltway and Pedro Rivera Mendez Street, at 
the "Suto" condominium, on San Aurelio Avenue, and on Virgen de 
Cotoca Avenue. 
  According to the seizure records, 38 assorted vehicles were 
seized at two urban properties -- Aurelio and Cotoca. 
  The police seized 22 vehicles at "Cotoca Automobile Sales," 
among them trucks, tractors, automobiles, vans, jeeps, and 
pickups. Likewise, 16 vehicles were seized at "San Aurelio 
Automobile Sales." Nine other automobiles were seized in 
different places.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities monitored through 23 June. 
  The World Bank and the International Development Association 
have granted $860 million to Bolivia over the past few years, of 
which $210 has been repaid, while the remaining $650 million 
will be paid back over the next 40 years. (La Paz HOY in 
Spanish 9 Jun 94 p 17) 
  On 15 June in Rome, the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development and the Bolivian Government signed a 7.6 million 
loan agreement designed to finance a development project for 
llama and alpaca breeders of the Andean Altiplano. The project 
includes 17 provinces in the departments of La Paz, Oruro, and 
Potosi, where 31,700 families are engaged in the breeding of 
llamas and alpacas. (La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p B8) 
  The Central Bank reported that international reserves had 
risen to $448 million by the first half of June, the highest 
level in the past 14 years. Freely available foreign exchange 
reserves now total $434 million. (Santa Cruz EL MUNDO in 
Spanish 18 Jun 94 National Section p 1) 
  Carlos Vilaseca, president of the National Chamber of 
Customs 
Officers, said on 10 June that customs revenues registered a 
$200 million deficit last year as a result of the illegal 
smuggling of merchandise, which amounted to $800 million. 
During the Eighth Congress of Customs Officers, Vilaseca 
charged that customs officials carry out joint operations with 
smugglers, to whom they grant protection. (La Paz LA RAZON in 
Spanish 11 Jun 94 p B4)

  [Text] The Cairns Group has been holding secret meetings. 
Sources attending the meetings told EL OBSERVADOR that some 
members reported that many developed countries are not 
fulfilling their commitments to liberalize trade as agreed at 
the end of the Uruguay round of GATT talks in April. 
  During the meeting members reproached each other for their 
attitude during and after the Uruguay round of talks. 
  The sources added that during the Cairns Group meeting in 
Montevideo on 19 and 20 May, some delegates claimed to have 
reliable information on unfair trade practices, which were 
thought to have been overcome but which are still being used. 
  Representatives of agricultural country agreed that the 
failure to fulfill GATT agreements hurt the agricultural 
countries that do not subsidize their products. Representatives 
agreed on the need to follow developments in order to guarantee 
respect for international agreements. 
  "The clause referring to subsidies for producers must be 
supervised carefully. We must follow its implementation closely 
to prevent its use against our interests," the Brazilian 
delegate said during the secret meeting. 
  He added: "I have very clear information that some countries 
will not fulfill their commitment to the Uruguay round of GATT 
talks because their budgets will be affected. This is very 
dangerous and we must be very careful." 
  Various speakers had similar complaints. They all agreed "to 
follow" developments within the economic policies of other 
blocs, seeking to detect failures to fulfill their agreements in 
the area of agriculture. 
  The Argentine representative said "we must become a thorn in 
the side of Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo; if we do not, the 
Cairns Group could become a bureaucratic mess and disappear. We 
must pack our bags, go there, and needle them." 
  The Uruguayan delegation indicated that "the schedules for 
implementing the commitments of the Marrakech Declaration do not 
coincide with our timetable," warning that "the implementation 
of the Uruguay Round commitments must not be postponed." 
  The private sessions of the Cairn Group ministers meeting 
did 
not run in perfect harmony even though an attempt was made to 
present a united front. 
  Argentina took advantage of the situation to criticize 
members of the group that indulge in the practice of subsidies. 
The innuendo was directed mainly at Brazil and Canada with whom 
Argentina had a controversy regarding the trading of wheat. 
  The meeting's most tense moment came when Australian Trade 
Minister Bob McMullan, who presided the sessions, implicitly 
acknowledged that Australia had individually negotiated 
agricultural matters with the United States and the EU [European 
Union] without informing other Cairns Group members. The 
situation is serious because Australia exercised the Group's 
presidency during the Uruguay Round. 
  An Argentine petition to include in the agenda a common 
strategy regarding a common agricultural policy motivated 
McMullan's acknowledgement. 
  McMullan, notably perturbed, admitted that the document was 
Australia's, but indicated that his country was still 
negotiating with the United States and Europe and did not want 
the Cairns Group to follow it up if the proposal did not have a 
chance of being successful. 
  The topic was not discussed any more during the meeting but 
several South American diplomats later commented that McMullan's 
answer suggested a deceitful form of conduct by Australia and 
highlighted the lack of a total cohesion within the group. 
  During the final secret session, the Australian 
representative recommended that the delegations should exhibit 
an image of internal consensus and imply that the Cairns Group 
obtained concrete achievements during the Uruguay Round.

  [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Three Ecuadoran Indians were 
killed in clashes with military forces, who were enforcing the 
state of emergency and clearing the country's highways, 
Legislator Maria Eugenia Lima has stated. 
  The highways have been blocked since 13 June by Indians 
protesting the recent approval of an agrarian law. The agrarian 
law was declared unconstitutional in the past few hours. 
  Legislator Lima reported today that two of the three people 
were killed last night in the Andean town of Guamote, Chimborazo 
Province, some 180 km south of Quito, when soldiers were 
evicting a group of Indians from a church. 
  Guamote is near the city of Riobamba. The cathedral in the 
city of Riobamba was occupied this morning by 100 Indians who 
are supported by Victor Corral, bishop of the diocese. A church 
spokesperson told EFE that Victor Corral will reiterate his 
support for the Indians upon his return from Rome tomorrow. 
  Luis Macas, Quechua leader and president of the 
Confederation 
of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the third 
Indian was killed last night in the Andean province of 
Tungurahua, some 110 km from Quito, when soldiers were forcing 
Indians to return to their communities. 
  Last week, the Conaie reported that three other Indians were 
killed in Canar Province, which is farther south of Tungurahua 
and Chimborazo. The Conaie said they were "victims of 
paramilitary landlords." Other reports, however, attributed the 
deaths to merchants who claim their stores had been looted by 
demonstrators. 
  The Conaie also reported previously that an Indian was 
killed 
in Tungurahua. According to press reports, he was struck by a 
driver who attempted to evade the barricades. 
  The incidents occurred 48 hours after the state of emergency 
was declared Tuesday by Conservative President Sixto Duran 
Ballen, who is 73 years old. 
  Immediately after the deaths were reported, increasing to 
seven the number of dead since the protests began on Monday of 
last week, the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC) 
suspended the provisions of the agrarian law, declaring it 
unconstitutional. 
  Carlos Jaramillo, TGC president, said the six tribunal 
members decided unanimously "to totally suspend the provisions 
of the law because it was found to have flaws in form and 
substance." 
  "The law was declared unconstitutional and its provisions 
were suspended. I have arranged to send the TGC resolution to 
the Supreme Court immediately so that the law will be 
definitively suspended," Jaramillo added.

<F P=106> [By special correspondent Jose Luiz Longo from Cape Town, </F>
South Africa] 
  [Text] The military issue was at the center of a meeting 
held yesterday by PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luiz 
Inacio Lula da Silva and Minister Jay Naidoo, the coordinator of 
the South African social reform program. Lula voiced concern 
over the redemocratization of the Armed Forces. He said he 
intends to set up rules based on constitutional provisions in 
coordination with military commanders. 
  Lula expressed his concern about redemocratizing the Armed 
Forces when Naidoo alluded to the extreme care with which the 
South African Government is addressing the issue, taking into 
account that security in South Africa continues to remain 
exclusively in the hands of the white minority. 
  Lula acknowledged that the situation in the Brazilian Armed 
Forces is different, because they have fewer resources than the 
South African military, whose budget will have to be streamlined 
to allow the government to increase investments in social areas. 
  Lula said: In our case, our military even have financial 
problems in procuring polish for their boots. Yet we share the 
same concern about democratizing the Armed Forces. 
  Before having dinner with Naidoo -- a former president of 
COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], a trade union 
organization similar to CUT [Sole Workers Center] in Brazil -- 
Lula said he hopes to have the support of trade union 
organizations, especially CUT, to give greater dynamics to 
government-labor-management committees if he is elected 
president. 
  Lula said: Government-labor-management committees are 
important tools in relieving unions from merely channeling wage 
demands to addressing issues such as economic growth goals in 
our talks with the government and employers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Dollar Falls"] </F>
  [Text] The sharp drop of the dollar's foreign exchange rate 
with other international currencies during the past two days has 
been attributed to expectations of rising inflation in the 
United States due to the high price of commodities. The U.S. 
economic recovery has opened the way for possible new 
inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve, or Fed, has been 
anticipating those pressures and increasing its interest rates 
during the year's first six months. 
  The price increase in raw materials is considered an 
indication that interest rates are still not high enough and 
will climb even more. The prospect was enough for the market to 
start dropping capital marked in dollars, expecting to buy them 
back later after an interest rate increase. That reluctance to 
keep dollars produced the drop in the foreign exchange rate. 
  It seems clear that those movements will result in changes, 
perhaps important changes, in the international financial 
scenario. Obviously, it is still early to make any definitive 
assessment, but everything indicates that after the turbulence 
there will be still higher interest rates in the United States. 
  The Federal Reserve's refusal to approve higher interest 
rates, despite the strong market pressure, produced the 
additional speculation that the monetary authority might be 
evaluating the possibility of a more permanent foreign exchange 
rate adjustment. The speculation continued even after U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States was not 
interested in a devaluation, although it is a fact that the drop 
in the dollar price will benefit U.S. exports. If this is the 
case, interest rate increases would be smaller or authorities 
would, at least, take longer to implement them. 
  Brazil will not benefit from an increase in international 
interest rates. Higher foreign interest rates would reduce the 
margin making the national market attractive for foreign 
investors. Besides, high interest rates mean higher costs to 
renegotiate the foreign debt, that is, higher costs for the 
Brazilian Government. 
  The effect of these eventual changes, however, will be slow 
to appear. The record volume of the country's reserves will give 
us a good margin for maneuvering, and the effect of a possible 
increase in the cost of renegotiating the foreign debt will be 
gradual. The impact on the Real Plan will be small, but we might 
have to anticipate future narrower margins in our economic 
policies.

Brasilia] 
  [Text] The Brazilian Government may import medicines from 
the PRC. This was discussed today by Chinese Public Health 
Minister Chen Minzhang and Brazilian Health Ministry officials. 
The Chinese guarantee that the medicines will arrive in Brazil 
at prices below domestic ones. Minister Chen says China 
produces medicines with lower costs because they are produced on 
a large scale and the raw materials are obtained through 
advanced technologies. Health Secretary Adney Moraes said the 
import of Chinese medicines is a way to solve the problem of 
high medicine prices in Brazil. The Brazilian Government will 
examine the feasibility of the Chinese proposal.

  [Text] Brasilia, 22 Jun (EFE) -- The Brazilian Government 
has proposed to the four member countries of the Common Market 
of the South, Mercosur, -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay -- a common external tariff below 20 percent for 
informatics and telecommunications products as of 2001. 
  Brazilian Ambassador Jose Arturo De Medeiros on 22 June told 
EFE that Brazil, which wants to protect its informatics 
industry, is willing to reduce its import tariffs, which 
currently are at 35 percent, to below 20 percent by 2001. 
  De Medeiros, a professional diplomat, is a member of the 
Brazilian delegation negotiating with the other Mercosur member 
countries on the common external tariffs Mercosur will impose on 
imports as of 1 January 1995, when Mercosur becomes a free trade 
zone. 
  The technical negotiations over a common external tariff, 
which should be ready by 15 July when the presidents of the 
Mercosur member countries meet in Buenos Aires, have agreed on 
almost 85 percent of products. The negotiations have, 
nonetheless, been paralyzed over vital subjects like 
petrochemical and especially informatics and telecommunications 
products. 
  With the new proposal presented 17 June during a technical 
meeting in Buenos Aires, Brazil expects the negotiations to make 
considerable progress and finish in three weeks. 
  According to the Brazilian proposal that apparently was 
viewed with interest by the other member countries' 
representatives, Brazil will reduce its import tariffs on 
informatics and telecommunications equipment until reaching a 
rate below 20 percent in 2001, which is the maximum allowed by 
Mercosur. 
  According to the same proposal, Argentina, Paraguay, and 
Uruguay -- which import informatics and telecommunications 
equipment with minimum import tariffs (Argentina imports these 
products with a zero tariff) -- will increase their tariffs 
until meeting the same level of Brazilian tariffs in 2001. 
  The Brazilian proposal, if accepted by its partners, will 
allow the negotiations over the common external tariff to 
conclude on time, but making an exception for capital, 
informatics, and telecommunications products. 
  Free trade and a common external tariff for 90 percent of 
products will be established among the four member countries as 
of 1995 and until 2001, the year when the exceptions will end 
and the common external tariff will be the same for all products 
for the four member countries. 
  Brazilian insistence on protecting its informatics industry 
had forced the Mercosur negotiators to declare that the tariffs 
among the four member countries would be the same only by 2006 
and that it would be very difficult to reach an agreement in the 
informatics and telecommunications field. 
  According to the newspaper GAZETA MERCANTIL, the new 
Brazilian proposal was possible thanks to a concession granted 
by the national industry after a government request. 
  Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay must give an answer to the 
Brazilian proposal next week when the technical negotiators meet 
in Montevideo.

<F P=106> [Article: "Defeat of the Cassandras"; introductory paragraph </F>
in boldface as published] 
  [Text] When polled by EXAME, the business elite 
respond: the real is good, stability is not a dream, and the 
economy is going to grow. 
  Attention, Cassandras: the following report is horrible news 
for you. Because the inescapable conclusion is this: the mania 
for thinking that things are going badly and tending to get even 
worse is out of style. EXAME took the pulse of the elite of the 
business world's elite--the 500 largest firms--on various 
subjects: elections, the economy, and inflation. Out of the 
total number of questionnaires sent out, 126 were returned for 
tabulation. That is a highly representative sample in polls of 
this kind. The results can be expressed in three words: 
optimism, optimism, and optimism (see the table below). The 
answers to the questionnaire sent to businessmen and executives 
of the country's leading companies are a kind of confession of 
faith. Faith in growth. Faith in stabilization. Faith in the 
plan created around former Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso to 
defeat inflation. True, their faith is not all that great when 
the subject is the post-election scenario, but it would be an 
exaggeration to say that they foresee the apocalypse if Lula is 
elected. 
  "The economy will probably continue to grow regardless of 
who 
the next president is," says Stephen Kanitz, EXAME's consultant 
and the man in charge of the poll. "What may happen is that the 
rate of growth will be faster or slower depending on which 
candidate is elected." Kanitz uses a number of main arguments to 
back up that view. The first is that given their low level of 
indebtedness, Brazilian firms are fully capable of maintaining a 
cycle of prolonged growth. His second argument concerns the 
emancipation that the private sector has won from the state. 
"The businessmen have learned to turn around without the state," 
says Kanitz. "They no longer depend so much on Brasilia to make 
their decisions for them." Finally, in the opinion of Kanitz, 
the agreement signed with the bankers and the Real Plan take 
care of two problems whose solution requires that the government 
continue to play a crucial role: the foreign debt and the fight 
against inflation. 
  Repressed demand--That kind of optimism is echoed by several 
businessmen. One of them is Manoel Octavio Pereira Lopes, who is 
a stockholder in and president of Alcatel, the 
telecommunications giant. The firm he heads lost $30 million 
last year. Despite that, its investment program for 1994--on the 
order of $25 million--has continued unchanged. Pereira Lopes is 
among those who feel that the economy will probably grow by 
about 5 percent this year and then continue to expand next year 
"thanks to the economic plan." There are also those who mention 
other reasons in support of their optimism. "There is repressed 
demand in the infrastructure area that has reached its limit," 
says Roberto Muller, president of the ABB [Asea Brown Boveri]. 
"It is inevitable that from now on, business in that area is 
going to recover." In the opinion of Jose Marques, the firm's 
vice president, that prediction has a good chance of coming 
true. Reason: the possibility now opening up for partnerships 
between private capital and the public sector in areas such as 
electricity, which is the ABB's main field. That is also the 
reason why the ABB has not altered its plan to invest $20 
million to modernize its equipment and increase its productivity 
this year. 
  As is natural in an economy as complex as Brazil's, there 
are 
different reactions in some sectors. Businessman Jacks 
Rabinovich, for example, who is one of the owners of the Vicunha 
textile group (and also owns an interest in businesses in the 
world of finance and iron and steel), prefers to be cautious in 
his predictions. Rabinovich believes that GDP [gross domestic 
product] will rise and that the Real Plan will be a success, but 
he detects a temporary cooling which he attributes to the 
introduction of the real. "Store owners are buying with URV's 
[units of real value], but they have to sell in real cruzeiros," 
he says. "That difference in currencies will end up causing a 
harmful gap." In his opinion, the economy today is being pulled 
by a few locomotives. The automobile industry, because of its 
formidable influence on GDP, is chief of among them, he says. 
"But I hope that with the arrival of the real, there will be a 
more homogeneous development of business," he adds. 
Incidentally, there is no lack of support for introduction of 
the new currency. As the poll figures show, nearly 10 out of 10 
businessmen and executives consider the Real Plan superior to 
its predecessors. "At last we have a plan that respects 
contracts, relies on the strength of the market, and dispenses 
with arbitrary packages," says Paulo Ferreira, the Dow Group's 
vice president for chemicals in Latin America.

  Premature departure--After being out of the country for two 
years, Ferreira returned in April after Dow moved its Latin 
American office here from Miami. He liked what he saw. "When I 
left, it was the impeachment period, and people were exuding 
skepticism," he says. "Now it is easy to see that the situation 
has changed for the better and that society has matured a great 
deal." In his opinion, that new maturity is one of the main 
factors justifying optimism about the future. As far as a 
permanent stabilization of the economy is concerned, Ferreira 
warns that there are still some stages to go through. "What has 
been done so far is the equivalent of clearing off the table. 
Now it is necessary to set out the plates and provide the food." 
Among the things that still need to be done, Ferreira draws 
attention to measures making it possible to put the national 
accounts in order. His views on that subject agree with those of 
Rabinovich of Vicunha, Muller of the ABB, and Pereira Lopes of 
Alcatel. The latter three stress that long-term stabilization 
requires changes that must not perfunctory in any way. Chief 
among them is a persevering attack on the state's obesity. That 
plan has ended up being delayed by the fiasco of constitutional 
revision. "No matter who forms the new administration, those 
reforms cannot be postponed," says Pereira Lopes. "Society 
demands it." 
  Because Fernando Henrique has become publicly identified 
with 
that reformist talk, it is easy to understand why, in this poll 
by EXAME, he emerges as the candidate preferred by businessmen. 
"While he was minister, he took stands corresponding to what the 
country needs," says Ferreira. "The success of the economic plan 
will be his best platform." Marques of the ABB adds an argument 
in favor of Fernando Henrique, saying: "He has a solid presence 
in the legislative branch. And the next administration is going 
to need support in Congress to put through the pending reforms." 
The fact that Fernando Henrique is not doing so well in the 
polls does not seem to bother his supporters too much, at least 
for the present. Rabinovich, for example, feels that "a lot of 
water will flow under the bridge" between now and the elections. 
"It is too early to make any predictions now, because 
campaigning has not even started," he says. 
  Although clearly ahead among businessmen, candidate Fernando 
Henrique also stirs some criticism. "He should have stayed on as 
minister to carry out the plan," says Eugenio Staub, president 
of Gradiente. Staub feels that his departure from the ministry 
was premature, created an image of someone merely looking for 
votes, and compromised his credibility. Even worse, Staub feels 
that Fernando Henrique's actions as a candidate are distorting 
his political personality. "The alliance with the PFL [Liberal 
Front Party] is a contradiction with his past, as is his 
participation in pilgrimages in honor of Father Cicero," he 
says. Disappointed by those attitudes in someone he says is a 
personal friend, Staub has declared his neutrality. He even 
confesses to some liking for Lula's message. "Some of the things 
he says are pertinent," he says. "The big problem is not 
ideology but the question of whether Lula's team is competent to 
administer a country like Brazil." 
  Volume of investments--There seems to be unanimous opinion 
on 
one thing, however. Although no one fears a cataclysm, there is 
certainty regarding the impact that a possible victory by Lula 
will have on the volume of investments in our country. Even 
firms saying that they are inclined to make no changes in their 
investment plans--examples being Vicunha, Dow, the ABB, 
Gradiente, and Alcatel--call attention to the negative effects 
that a victory by Lula will have on the inflow of capital from 
abroad. "There are many choices in the international market," 
says Rabinovich, whose group this year will open a plant in 
Natal that absorbed investments totaling $150 million. "It is 
understandable that foreign investors should think twice before 
investing in Brazil if Lula wins." Kanitz agrees. He has no 
doubt that a victory by Fernando Henrique will be much more 
welcome abroad than one by the PT [Workers Party] candidate. 
Even Staub, who is not dying of love for the candidacy supported 
by the alliance between the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy 
Party] and the PFL, is not neglecting a few precautions. At this 
time of the year, Gradiente should be drawing up its three-year 
plan. But that project has been shelved until after the 
elections. Staub justifies the postponement by recourse to 
semantic subtleties. "It is not that we have decided to slam on 
the brakes," he says. "It's just that we have taken our foot off 
the accelerator."

    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 16 
June. 
<H5>  PRODUCTION </H5>
  According to CNI, the National Confederation of Industries, 
Brazilian industrial sales dropped by 15.3 percent in April 1994 
in comparison with the previous month, and by 11.4 percent in 
comparison with April 1993, the greatest such slip recorded by 
CNI since it began operations in 1992. CNI economists believe 
that the strong decline in sales is due to the conversion of the 
economy into real value units, URV's, which has caused much 
uncertainty, and also to the government decision to maintain 
high interest rates, thus inhibiting consumption. As a 
consequence, installed industrial capacity dropped from 76.7 
percent in March to 74.8 percent in April. According to the Rio 
de Janeiro State Federation of Industries, Firjan, industrial 
production in Rio de Janeiro dropped by 6.4 percent during the 
January-May period in comparison with the same period last year. 
(Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 15 Jun 94 p 25) 
  The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, 
has reported that in February industrial production dropped in 
northeastern Brazil by 6.8 percent, while it increased by 5.5 
percent in Sao Paulo and by 1.4 percent in southern Brazil. In 
Sao Paulo, industrial production has increased by 7.8 percent 
since the beginning of the year, and by 12.1 percent in the past 
12 months. This increase in Sao Paulo is due mainly to a 13.6 
percent productivity increase in the metal industry in February, 
10.3 percent in mechanics, 27.6 percent in transportation 
materials, and a 9.4 percent increase in the chemical industry. 
Productivity nonetheless dropped by 14.5 percent in plastics, 
7.4 percent in textiles, and 8.8 percent in the food products 
industries during the same month in Sao Paulo. In northeastern 
Brazil, industrial productivity has dropped by 6.6 percent since 
the beginning of the year, and by 4 percent in the past 12 
months. In February in the northeast, industrial production 
dropped by 17.3 percent in the chemical industry, 7.1 percent in 
the food industry, and 19.8 percent in the cardboard industry. 
Industrial production nonetheless increased by 4.6 percent in 
the metal industry, 2.8 percent in mineral extraction, and 3.7 
percent in the textile industry during the same month. In 
February, industrial production dropped by 21.1 percent in 
Pernambuco, 6.6 percent in Bahia, 0.1 percent in Rio de Janeiro, 
4.5 percent in Santa Catarina, and 1.8 percent in Rio Grande do 
Sul. In comparing the January-February period of this year with 
that of 1993, industrial production increased by 12.4 percent in 
Minas Gerais, by 8.8 percent in Parana, by 7.8 percent in Sao 
Paulo, by 4.9 percent in southern Brazil, by 2.3 percent in Rio 
Grande do Sul, and by 0.5 percent in Santa Catarina. (Sao Paulo 
AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2104 GMT 10 Jun 94) 
  Sales by Rio de Janeiro industries dropped by 18.3 percent 
in 
May in comparison with the same month of last year. They 
nonetheless increased by 0.7 percent in comparison with April. 
These figures were supplied by Firjan, which carried out a 
study among 200 factories from 13 different industries, 
representing nearly 50 percent of employed labor in Rio de 
Janeiro State. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2337 GMT 
14 Jun 94) 
  According to the GAZETA MERCANTIL Information Center, 
textile 
companies have filed for bankruptcy in Sao Paulo and Rio de 
Janeiro courts as follows: 77 in May 1994, 65 in April, 88 in 
March, 52 in February, and 29 in January; and in 1993, 44 in 
December and 69 in November. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in 
Portuguese 9 Jun 94 p 31) 
<H5>  EXPORTS </H5>
  Foreign Trade Secretary Jorge Chami Batista has reported 
that 
Brazilian exports amounted to $3.86 billion in May, which is 
32.35 percent greater than the same month last year. He said 
that in the past five months Brazilian exports have reached a 
total of $16.37 billion, which represents a 7.81 percent 
increase in comparison with the same period in 1993. He 
reported that sales to Argentina increased by 24.1 percent 
during the January-May period in comparison with the same period 
in 1993, while sales to Japan dropped by 14.53 percent during 
the same period. The exports that experienced the greatest 
increase during the January-May period were soybeans, which 
increased by 58.22 percent; green coffee and roasted coffee 
beans, 34.93 percent; orange juice, 48 percent; and spare 
automobile parts, 17.77 percent. For the same period the 
exports experiencing the greatest drops were iron, 0.98 percent; 
tobacco, 38.4 percent; laminated iron and steel sheets, 24.37 
percent; and aluminum ore, 14.28 percent. The main clients of 
Brazil during the January-May period were: the United States, 
which purchased goods worth a total of $3.39 billion; Argentina, 
$1.55 billion; the Netherlands, $1.31 billion; Japan, $883 
million; Germany, $723 million; and Italy, $612 million. (Sao 
Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 1911 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
<H5>  FOREIGN INVESTMENT </H5>
  Druing a seminar on the Argentine capital market and economy 
held on 8 June in Sao Paulo, Argentine National Securities 
Commission, CNV, Vice President Francisco Guilhermo Susmel 
announced that Argentine investment funds have been authorized 
to invest 100 percent of their assets in Brazilian shares. 
Argentine investment funds had previously been authorized to 
invest only 25 percent of their assets in foreign companies. 
Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission, CVM, President 
Thomas Tosta de Sa reported that both the CNV and the CVM are 
working together to unify the rules for Argentine and Brazilian 
investment funds within the framework of the Common Market of 
the South. (Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94 p 
20) 
  The balance of foreign capital invested in Brazil, mainly in 
the stock exchanges, was $826.07 million in May, representing a 
90 percent increase in relation to April. This figure is the 
result of an inflow of $1.53 billion and an outflow of $706.08 
million. During the January-May period foreign capital inflow 
amounted to a total of $8.35 billion while outflow was $5.55 
billion, yielding a positive balance of $2.79 billion. These 
figures were released on 15 June by the CVM, which also reported 
that foreign investments were distributed in the following 
manner in Brazil: 67.91 percent in the stock exchange, 7.67 
percent in by-products, 16.07 percent in bonds, 8.39 percent in 
privatization papers, and 0.05 percent in Financial Investment 
Funds, FAF. By decision of the economic team, foreign investors 
have been forbidden from entering the money market since 
mid-1993. As for the origin of capital, 33.6 percent of the 
investments come from North America, 31 percent from Central 
America, 11.9 percent from South America, 22.2 percent from 
Europe, and 1.3 percent from Asia and Oceania. As for the 
investment institutions, in May 38.8 percent of these were 
banks, 31 percent brokers, 29.7 percent trusts and pension 
funds, and 0.5 percent non-profit financial institutions. 
According to the CVM, the largest net asset administrators are 
the following banks: Chase Manhattan Bank, Garantia, Citibank 
DTVM, Boston, Pactual, Itau, Economico CCVM, Matrix DTVM, and 
Unibanco. Three new investors were registered last month with 
their own funding portfolios, and two others in collective 
portfolios, increasing the number of investors operating in 
Brazil to 221 for those with their own portfolios and 166 for 
those who operate in collective portfolios. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA 
ESTADO in Portuguese 2146 GMT 15 Jun 94) 
<H5>  PRIVATIZATION </H5>
  On 14 June President Itamar Franco signed a provisional 
measure authorizing a loan of $11 million for the Lloyd 
Brazilian State Shipping Company, and providing for the 
implementation of an economic, financial, and operational 
streamlining of the company so that it can again be put up for 
auction in 90 days. Two auctions have already been held, but 
failed due to a lack of interested clients. The loan is meant 
to pay Lloyd's debts abroad, and for the release of two ships 
that are being withheld in the port of London. In the past four 
years the Brazilian Government has released $40 million to 
streamline the Lloyd company. According to the provisional 
measure, Lloyd should immediately sell for cash all the assets 
needed to repay its loans. The government is thus practically 
forcing Lloyd to sell one of its ships. The money collected 
from this sale must be deposited in the BNDES bank to the order 
of the Social and Merchant Navy Fund, where the funds for Lloyd 
were obtained. The two Lloyd ships must be auctioned on 17 
June. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2330 GMT 13 Jun 
94) 
  Ricardo Figueiro, chief of the National Privatization 
Program, has announced auction dates for eight subsidiary 
companies of the Camacari Petrochemical Complex. This means 
that the voting shares owed by Petrobras Chemical Corporation, 
Petroquisa, in the Northeastern Petrochemical Company, Copene, 
which is currently valued at $1.2 billion, will be auctioned 
next 24 August with a base price of $369 million. Petroquisa's 
shares in Acrinor and Coperbo will be the first to be auctioned, 
on 26 July, with a base price of $11 million and $23 million 
respectively. Then it will the turn of Petroquisa's shares in 
Nitrocarbono, with a base price of $23 million, which will be 
auctioned on 28 July; Politeno, with a base price of $40 
million, on 2 August; Ciquine and Polialden, with a base price 
of $21 and $15 million respectively, on 6 August; and EDN, with 
a base price of $9 million, on 11 August. Finally, Figueiro 
said that the Lloyd Brazilian State Shipping Company will be 
auctioned on 29 July. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 
2035 GMT 14 Jun 94) 
<H5>  INFLATION </H5>
  The Getulio Vargas Foundation, FGV, has reported that prices 
in URV's are dropping. The General Price Index in URV's, which 
is called IGP 1-URV, dropped by 1.88 percent in May and by 0.09 
percent in April. The accumulated inflation in IGP 1-URV since 
the beginning of the year is 4.74 percent, and in the past 12 
months 13.94 percent. The Wholesale Price Index in URV's, IPA 
1-URV, dropped by 1.42 percent in April and by 3.73 percent in 
May. The IPA 1-URV has increased 0.81 percent so far this year. 
The Consumer Price Index in URV's, IPC 1-URV, increased by 0.56 
percent in May and 1.65 percent in April. So far this year the 
accumulated IPC 1-URV has increased by 7.67 percent. The 
National Construction Cost Index in URV's, INCC 1-URV, increased 
by 1.21 percent in May and 7.41 percent in April. So far this 
year the accumulated inflation in INCC 1-URV is 19.27 percent. 
(Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2222 GMT 10 Jun 94) 
<H5>  DOMESTIC SUPPLY </H5>
  The expectations created by the implementation of the real 
have led many cattle ranchers to leave their beef cattle in the 
pastures, making beef prices jump by 30.56 percent in 30 days. 
According to the Commodities and Futures Market, the price of 
one 32-pound arroba of beef in Sao Paulo increased from $15.29 
on 13 May to $21.34 on 13 June. The price in butcher shops of 
first and second class beef have increased by 85 and 135 percent 
respectively in the past 30 days. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in 
Portuguese 2246 GMT 13 Jun 94) 
<H5>  IMPORT TAXES </H5>
  The government has passed three provisions reducing the 
import taxes on three products. As of 1 July the import tax on 
all kinds of beef imports will be reduced from 10 percent to 
zero. According to Finance Ministry experts, the measure was 
adopted to safeguard a domestic supply problem and to prevent 
price increases now that the cattle slaughtering season is 
ending. The government also reduced the import tax on paper 
wrappings, craft paper, and cardboard from 10 and 15 percent to 
2 percent to counter recent unjustified price increases in the 
domestic market. The third provision benefits a single company, 
which imports a synthetic polyester fiber sponge to replace the 
domestically used steel sponge; the import tariff dropped from 5 
percent to zero. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2310 
GMT 14 Jun 94) 
<H5>  AGRICULTURAL LOANS </H5>
  The National Bank for Economic and Social Development, 
BNDES, 
has reported that it granted $175 million worth of financing to 
471 farming cooperatives between January 1991 and April 1994. 
Some of the loans granted by the BNDES were meant for: the 
Itambe Program to increase the milk cattle herds of 3,000 
farmers; the modernization of pork farms through the genetic 
improvement of the animals and productivity increases; the 
treatment of liquid wastes in keeping with environmental laws; 
and the installation of a vegetable oil extraction plant with 
the capacity to process 1,200 tonnes of soybeans in Guarapuava, 
Parana. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2202 GMT 10 Jun 
94) 
<H5>  SAO PAULO CONSUMPTION </H5>
  According to the Sao Paulo Commerce Association and the Sao 
Paulo Commerce Federation, the consumption index in Sao Paulo 
dropped in May. Market experts are thus ruling out an explosion 
of consumption with the implementation of the real. According 
to the Sao Paulo Commerce Federation, food consumption dropped 
by 15.48 percent in April. It also reports that the Cost of 
Living Index, ICV, showed that prices, after being converted 
into URV's and reaching a peak increase, then dropped by 2.22 
percent during the 1 March to 15 April period. Jose Silvestre 
Prado de Oliveira, economist from the Inter-Union Department for 
Statistics and Socioeconomic Studies, Dieese, says he does not 
expect people to rush to the supermarkets with the 
implementation of the real, as happened with the Cruzado Plan, 
because, he said, "the minimum salary is currently worth half 
what it was worth in 1986, and purchasing power has thus 
diminished." (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2256 GMT 
13 Jun 94) 
<H5>  SAO PAULO REVENUES </H5>
  Tax collection has shrunk in the state of Sao Paulo, and 
will 
be very difficult to recover. One of the reasons for this is 
that new industries no longer choose to open there because of 
high costs, the fiscal battle among the less industrialized 
states, and changes in the law on Goods and Services Movement 
Tax, ICMS. In 1990 Sao Paulo collected $10.6 billion worth of 
ICMS; this dropped to $7.5 billion in 1993. In 1988 Sao Paulo 
collected 43 percent of the entire country's ICMS; this has 
fallen to 38 percent this year. Sao Paulo Finance Secretary 
adviser Clovis Panzarini said that Sao Paulo will hardly recover 
from the fiscal battle among states. (Sao Paulo GAZETA 
MERCANTIL in Portuguese 9 Jun 94 p 1) 
<H5>  REAL IMPLEMENTATION CAMPAIGN </H5>
  On 15 June Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero will officially 
launch the government campaign to inform the public about the 
implementation of the real currency. One of the measures is the 
implementation of a telephone hotline through which any citizen 
can obtain information on the changes that the new currency will 
make in people's lives, such as in paying bills next month. The 
10 Central Bank branches disseminated throughout the country 
will distribute 16 million leaflets and 1.4 million posters 
describing the main characteristics of the real among all 
commercial bank agencies, lottery houses, bus stations, and 
shopping centers. People will also be able to send free 
telegrams to the Central Bank asking questions about the real. 
The answers will be transmitted by the "Voz do Brasil" program 
on a national radio hookup. The Central Bank is also preparing 
5 million pamphlets with questions and answers about the real, 
which will be distributed on 26 June, and in the main Sunday 
newspaper editions as well. The Central Bank is also preparing 
special leaflets on the real for small businessmen. The campaign 
to explain the implementation of the real also includes 
interviews and programs that will be transmitted daily through 
the "Radiobras" national broadcasting network. (Sao Paulo

  [Text] Regional technocrats are expected to attend a 
meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, to finalize the draft proposal on 
an Association of Caribbean States, ACS. It is an attempt to 
expand Caricom's [Caribbean Community] reach in the region. The 
draft is to be presented to regional leaders at the heads of 
government conference in Barbados next month. The ACS is to 
bring together Caricom member states with non-English speaking 
Caribbean territories and their neighbors on the South and 
Central American mainland. Trinidadian foreign affairs 
officials say there is consensus on the main aims and objectives 
of the ACS, but the Caracas meeting will tackle outstanding 
issues, such as membership and the administrative structure of 
the association. The ACS was one of the recommendations put 
forward by the West Indian Commission. Nicole Huggins tells us 
more: 
  [Begin Huggins recording] The formation of an Association of 
Caribbean States was recommended as a means of expanding the 
trading options of Caricom states, and also as a way of 
inserting Caricom into the evolving hemispheric bloc. Local 
foreign affairs officials seem to believe that the leaders of 
the countries involved have the political will to bring the idea 
to reality. Three meetings have been held this year in Jamaica, 
Dominica, and Mexico. The final meeting on the draft proposal is 
carded for Caracas. 
  There seems to be consensus on the main aims and objectives 
of the ACS: the creation of a larger area for economic 
relations, foreign policy coordination, and technical 
cooperation. But key issues such as the size, structure, and 
location of a secretariat are still to be worked out. A method 
of funding the ACS is yet to be defined, and in a region 
encompassing independent and nonindependent territories, 
membership procedures are still being discussed. 
  One major departure from the Caricom Treaty is for ACS 
members to have greater flexibility in choosing to be part of an 
ACS project. This differs significantly from the Caricom Treaty, 
which requires all member states to agree for almost anything to 
be attempted. 
  If the ACS gets off the ground, it could be the vehicle for 
which Caricom countries have been looking to bring their small 
economies closer to those of their larger Caribbean and Latin 
American neighbors. But with that comes a challenge, according 
to some regional experts, to ensure that Caricom is not 
swallowed up by its own creation. [end recording]

<F P=106> [From the "Evening Information Review" newscast] </F>
  [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina reiterated 
the Cuban Government's position to deny departure permits for 
people who forcibly occupy foreign missions. He also denounced 
foreign encouragement of the actions. 
  The Cuban foreign minister made the statements during a 
meeting with members of the Freedom To Travel group, a U.S. 
group that challenges their country's laws by visiting Havana. 
  Robaina told the visitors that all those who occupied the 
Chilean Consulate had already left and that 21 persons remain at 
the German Embassy and another 73 at the Belgian ambassador's 
residence. The foreign minister said that while some people are 
resorting to actions like this, the U.S. Interest Section has 
denied visas for 40,000 applicants. 
  Robaina told the members of the Freedom To Travel group, 
which is made up of some 190 persons from 25 U.S. states, that 
Cuba has a basic sense of responsibility and that is why it 
insists that diplomatic missions be protected and not trespassed.

  [Text] Havana, 24 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The nearly 100 Cuban 
refugees at the Belgian and German diplomatic missions must 
leave those facilities or "confine themselves for life in what 
will be a voluntary cell," the official newspaper GRANMA warned 
today. "No one will ever obtain authorization to emigrate 
through violence and the violation of Cuban and international 
laws," the newspaper, mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, 
reiterated. 
  This Friday, the official newspaper reported the 
"unconditional" departure of eight persons who entered the 
Chilean Consulate on 15 June and demanded permission to leave 
the island. The eight occupants, six men, one woman, and a 
12-year-old boy, left the mission at 1730 (2130 GMT) on Thursday 
in two official Chilean Consulate vehicles, a source at the 
mission stated. 
  A Chilean consulate source explained that none of the people 
occupying the South American mission in Havana had ever been 
charged with any criminal offense, and their stay in the mission 
took place without incident. 
  GRANMA also pointed out that 53 of the Cubans who decided to 
enter the residence of Belgian Ambassador Paul Vermeirsch on 28 
May had changed their minds about "their illegal and 
irresponsible conduct" and have "returned to their daily lives." 
  An official spokesman said that "21 persons who occupied the 
German Embassy on 13 June remain inside, while 72 Cubans remain 
inside the Belgian mission." Ambassador Vermiersch's home and 
the German mission are two blocks from each other and are 
located in the diplomatic district of Miramar, as is the Chilean 
Consulate. The streets leading to the two diplomatic missions 
remain closed to vehicles and pedestrians, except for neighbors. 
Dozens of uniformed police officers and state security agents 
dressed in civilian clothes provide permanent security 
throughout the area. 
  GRANMA also said that the Cuban Government has given "every 
assurance to representatives of the parties involved to solve 
the problem." "We reiterate: Future incidents of this type can 
be prevented only with energy, intelligence, and serenity," the 
official daily concludes.

  [Text] Russian Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets has 
expressed satisfaction with the progress made to establish the 
international association RosCuba, which consists of Russian and 
Cuban enterprises. During a meeting in Moscow with Leonel Soto, 
vice president of the Council of Ministers, Soskovets praised 
the signing of the statutes of the joint enterprise, which set 
the required legal basis for the operations of the organization. 
  A Cuban delegation spokesman said Soskovets believes that 
the 
creation of the RosCuba association is an important step in the 
opening of solid possibilities of economic and trade cooperation 
between both nations. 
  Lionel Soto described the quest for trade mechanisms beyond 
that of state structures as positive. Soskovets and Soto agreed 
in praising the fulfillment of the accords signed on 24 December 
when both signed the document forming the association. Soskovets 
and Soto also discussed the possibility of completing the 
construction of a nuclear plant in Cienfuegos by creating a 
joint enterprise.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by </F>
correspondent Ruben Pino; place and date not given; first 
paragraph announcer-read introduction -- recorded] 
  [Text] The Association of Caribbean States, ACS, will be 
formed in July. The new, regional, intergovernmental 
organization will unite nations with highly diverse political 
systems and socioeconomic development plans: 
  [Pino] Over 200 million people on 25 island nations, in 
Central and South America, and in 12 Caribbean territories will 
establish diverse ties through the ACS. Could this forum 
eventually represent a convergence of kindred politics and serve 
as the voice of the region on international events? If so, what 
about Cuba's participation? 
  [Robaina] Any integrationist event inevitably can be 
considered a forum for political convergence. In some measure, 
today's economic integration requires assuming certain positions 
and will intensify, above all, the Caribbean voice at important 
international events. It is important for us to join the 
Caribbean, the Caribbean to which we have always belonged and 
from which they have wanted to pretend to tear us. Depending on 
how well we get to know each other better and intensify efforts, 
we will clearly be better prepared to exchange and unite views 
and to have a stronger economic, political, and social voice. 
It will be extremely important to present a much more 
economically, politically, and socially united Caribbean at 
forums like the United Nations. When I speak of politics, I do 
not mean similar politics. Integration means that there is no 
need for identical ideological schemes to join things. We are 
being allowed to take united stands in the international arena. 
This clearly establishes a new voice and opens a period for the 
Caribbean that Cuba modestly asks to join, so that we can learn 
and modestly contribute whatever we can.

  [Text] Omar Morales, a Foreign Ministry specialist, has 
told PRENSA LATINA that plans to form the Association of 
Caribbean States, ACS, reflect the spirit of convergence among 
today's approaches to Latin American integration. Morales said 
this is very healthy for the hemisphere because it opens the way 
to a degree of economic unity that will put the hemisphere in a 
more advantageous position to negotiate with other regional 
groups in the world. 
  The ACS will include three regional blocs: the Caribbean 
Common Market, CARICOM; the Secretariat of Central American 
Economic Integration, SIECA; and the G-3, which includes Mexico, 
Venezuela, and Colombia. Morales also said that heads of state 
of the member countries will meet in the Barbadian capital on 4 
July to establish the ACS, an intergovernmental organization for 
regional teamwork, consultation, and cooperation.

  [Text] In Toronto, the Canadian (Cherris) Company has 
announced that it will create a joint enterprise with Cuban 
Nickel Enterprise for mining nickel and cobalt in Cuba. 
  The new enterprise includes others that will be directly in 
charge of the extraction, refining, and global marketing of 
nickel and cobalt. The Cuban Government has granted the new 
entity a mining claim comprising more than 60 million tons of 
iron oxide ore with nickel, with an 80 percent concentration of 
the reserves tested.
