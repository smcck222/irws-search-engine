  [Text] Cairo, 14 Jun (MENA)--Counselor Tal'at Hamid, press 
adviser to the Arab League secretary general, said the 
confession by Yusuf Sha'ban, member of the Fatah-the 
Revolutionary Council, that he was responsible for the bombing 
of the American plane over Lockerbie in 1988, is not the first 
of its kind that acquits Libya of this crime. 
  Commenting today on Sha'ban's confession, Hamid said there 
is 
another piece of evidence proving that Libya is not involved in 
the bombing: The president of the Swiss company that produced 
the timer used in the bombing retracted his testimony, on the 
basis of which Libya was condemned. 
  Hamid said the Arab League dealt with the Libyan-Western 
crisis objectively and rationally in accordance with the UN and 
Arab League Charters. 
  He said the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan 
suspects be tried by a Scottish panel of judges in the 
International Court of Justice in The Hague was meant as a 
chance for a fair trial based on the legal rule that the suspect 
is innocent until proven guilty. 
  Hamid described the West's solid rejection of any peaceful 
solutions to the crisis as lacking in an objective justification.

<F P=106> [Issued by the IDF Spokesman's Office] </F>
  [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] unequivocally 
denies the assertions made by "Human Rights Watch" in their 
report claiming that IDF personnel use torture in order to 
obtain confessions from Palestinian detainees. 
  Any means of torture or violence against detainees is 
forbidden under Israeli law, and any confession extracted 
against the free will of the detainee is inadmissible as 
evidence. The rules of questioning which apply to military 
detention facilities were approved by the Judge Advocate General 
Corps, and the IDF strictly abides by these rules. 
  Furthermore, there exists a mechanism for the strict 
supervision of military detention facilities by an advisory 
committee to the Chief of the General Staff, headed by the 
President of the Military Appeals Court. 
  These facilities are open to visits by, or are under the 
supervision of, representatives of the Attorney-General, the 
Military Police, lawyers representing the detainees, the Red 
Cross, and other human rights organizations. 
  In addition, every detainee may raise complaints against the 
behavior of IDF personnel carrying out questioning, and the 
manner in which the confession was taken from him, when he is 
brought before a judge in order to extend his detention, or 
during his trial. 
  In cases where complaints have been raised about the methods 
used during IDF questioning procedures, the complaints were 
immediately investigated by the Military Police, and when 
evidence corroborating the complaints was found, the suspects 
were brought to trial. It should be emphasized that the number 
of complaints is minimal.

  [Text] Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head of the 
Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee, says that the joint IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] and Palestinian police headquarters have 
proven themselves a great success. Sami' said the security 
situation in the autonomous areas is satisfactory, and voiced 
optimism concerning the Gaza-Jericho agreement. He added, 
however, that unless the economic situation in the Gaza Strip 
improves, the security situation could deteriorate. Our 
correspondent Geva' Qra'-'Oz reports that Brig. Gen. Sami' 
divulged that in the framework of their preparations for Yasir 
'Arafat's arrival in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinians have 
started preparing a helicopter landing pad in Gaza, despite the 
fact that they are not authorized to do so.

  [Text] Police Minister Moshe Shahal has announced that 
Palestinian women, regardless of age, and youths up to 16 years 
old can enter Israel freely again. The move eased an entry ban 
imposed on Palestinians from the territories following the wave 
of bombings in early April. Shahal said he hoped the move would 
lead to a return of normal life but this would depend on the 
Palestinian side. 
  A Qol Yisra'el reporter adds that despite the closure of the 
territories, police have been arresting several hundred 
Palestinians weekly for illegal entry into Israel.

  [Text] Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] Central Command, says that during the 
Yasir 'Arafat's stay in Jericho, Israeli citizens will not be 
allowed to enter the city. Maj. Gen. Biran added that it is 
clear that many residents of the territories will want to enter 
Jericho during this period and the IDF will not prevent them 
from doing so. It must be realized, however, that the small 
Jericho area cannot contain hundreds of thousands of people. 
Maj. Gen. Biran spoke in a briefing to foreign correspondents. 
Qol Yisra'el English Department correspondent Dick Winter 
reports that according to Maj. Gen. Biran, the Cave of the 
Patriarchs will be reopened in five to six weeks at the earliest.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] The demonstration by several hundred settlers 
outside the Prime Minister's Office is due to turn into a series 
of sit-down strikes, in which thousands of settler families will 
take part for several months. It will involve the voluntary 
evacuation of dozens of settlements for many weeks. The plan's 
guidelines are detailed in a document issued by the operational 
headquarters of the United Command of the Zionist Camp, which 
set up the protest encampment opposite the Prime Minister's 
Office. This document has reached HA'ARETZ. 
  The encampment is currently being operated in a restricted 
form following consultations with the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Prior to 
PLO head Yasir 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho, the camp will be 
expanded sharply for three days and then reduced again. The 
settlements which have so far participated in the restricted 
format are Ma'ale Levona, Yitzhar, Bet Hagay, Qiryat Arba', and 
Bet El. 
  The document, disseminated to the settlements, says among 
other things that "we are not discussing an ordinary Rose Garden 
model demonstration [outside the Knesset], not a representation 
from each settlement, but participation by most inhabitants of 
the settlements, by entire famililies. Those who support 
families will continue going to work, their base being a strike, 
while essential work in the settlement will be left to a 
minority which may not come. 
  "This is an act that requires devotion and endurance. It is 
built not on breaking the law, closing roads, going to jail, 
etc., but on a massive legal demonstration by a very large 
public, prepared to do what is needed to save the nation and the 
state from those who collaborate with the enemy against their 
blood brothers." 
  "Success," the document says, "depends on creating the right 
atmosphere in the settlements, which will reflect the gravity of 
the situation and our national responsibility during these 
difficult times, and which will inspire the entire public to 
stand like a pillar in the face of the government's astonishing 
abandonment of all Jewish, Zionist, security, and existential 
values. We must initiate a sit-down strike, which will last 
several months, outside the Prime Minister's Office until there 
is a shift in the political reality towards the settlements in 
Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. 
  "The message is simple. The minority government's scheming 
-- underpinned by Israel's enemies -- against citizens whom 
successive Israeli Governments sent to inhabit settlements, is 
unbearable. The government broke all the rules. We must 
respond by also breaking the rules," the document says. 
  The paper contains a series of questions and answers which 
present the anticipated vacillation over the plan. Question: 
"Will the government not be pleased by the fact that we will 
abandon settlements?" Answer: "We are not discussing 
abandoning settlements, but a sharp demonstrative act against 
the government's scheming against the settlements, its forsaking 
the security of the settlements, and endangering all the 
citizens of the country...." 
  Question: "Will not basing the strike mainly on settlers 
make the struggle sectarian and will it not play into the hands 
of the left and the government?" 
  Answer: "A sharp demonstrative act by a sector hurt by the 
government is legitimate and acceptable. Beyond that, it 
involves thousands of families taking to the streets and backing 
by thousands of families living in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza 
Strip, who constitute a very large sector of society. All this 
shows that the sectarian issue is secondary in this case. 
Thousands of striking families will be an unbearable phenomenon 
for the government. 
  "Any departure from routine life constitutes a problem for 
the government. When a plant is closed by the government and 
its workers hole up in the closed plant, the government 
negotiates to make sure the workers get what they want. Dozens 
of closed settlements, thousands of citizens permanently in the 
streets, is an unbearable situation for any regime...." 
  Question: "Does such an act not weaken the settlements?" 
  Answer: "The government's plan is demonic, to slowly weaken 
the settlements until the settlers leave freely. The process 
will go on not matter what. Routine life continuing in the 
settlements is in the government's interest. The settlements' 
steadfastness is meant to erode the Palestinian police's 
assistance to attacks by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], 
with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] constituting part of the 
international observer force." 
  The joint command of the right-wing movements plans to hold 
demonstrations today at five main Jerusalem junctions as a sort 
of dress rehearsal to test the public's response prior to 
implementing its plan to take to the streets on the day of 
'Arafat's arrival in Jericho. At the same time, dozens of other 
settler families plan to reinforce the encampment opposite the 
Prime Minister's Office. 
  On the day of 'Arafat's arrival in Jericho, the planners say 
that activity is planned for Jerusalem, when they hope hundreds 
of thousands will participate. If 'Arafat plans to reach 
Jerusalem, these people will be diverted to the Old City. 
  A gathering organized by three bodies was held in Jerusalem 
yesterday: the Rabbis Union for Israel and Eretz Yisra'el, 
headed by Rabbis Avraham Shapira, Sha'ul Yisre'eli, and Moshe 
Tzvi Neriya; the right-wing professors circle; and the "Follow 
Me" forum of senior army officers in the IDF reserves. 
  The officers even announced yesterday that "we will stop 
'Arafat with our bodies" and published "call-up orders" to their 
friends "to be prepared for action so as not to permit mass 
murderer 'Arafat to enter the gates of the country." 
  Rabbi Hayim Druckman, who moderated the gathering, said that 
Israeli nationalists are not prepared to accept the current 
situation. "We will not permit such a situation to take place. 
We will do everything we can to foil it. We are sure that the 
people do not want it to happen," Druckman said. When the 
gathering ended, the participants held a protest march to the 
prime minister's residence.

  [Text] The Israeli delegation to the multilateral talks in 
Morocco has left for Rabat. In the Morocco, the participating 
states will deal with joint tourism, economic, and development 
projects. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: 
  [Begin Segal recording] This round of multilateral economic 
talks being held in Rabat, Morocco will focus on new proposals 
on regional economics in transportation, agriculture, and 
tourism. The Israeli delegation, led by Bank of Israel Governor 
Ya'aqov Frenkel and Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir 
left for Morocco this morning. The delegation will discuss 
implementation of European plans, such as the establishment of a 
joint tourism Riviera between Jordan, Egypt, and Israel on the 
Red Sea. Within that framework, there are plans to open the 
Jordanian-Israeli border to tourism and to linking the 
transportation and electricity infrastructures along the 
coastline. Fourteen Arab states -- including the PLO -- and 25 
states outside the region -- including the United States, Japan 
and the EU -- are participating in the fifth round of economic 
multilaterals. A Foreign Ministry delegation headed by 'Oded 
'Eran, assistant director general in charge of economics, was in 
Morocco last week to prepare the meeting with the Moroccans. 
The Foreign Ministry believes that progress along the bilateral 
track will permit progress in the Rabat talks and along the 
Jordanian track. 
  Other political-economic activity is being conducted by 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres himself, who left for Luxembourg 
this morning to attend a meeting of the European Council of 
Ministers. Peres is trying to persuade the ministers to reword 
the economic accord between Israel and the EU. [end recording]

  [Text] Israel and the Vatican this morning officially 
announced the establishment of full diplomatic relations and the 
setting up of embassies. Under the agreement signed yesterday, 
two joint committees -- one economic and the other judicial -- 
would be set up. 
  Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, in announcing 
diplomatic 
relations with the Vatican, said he believes the idea of 
dividing Jerusalem up into boroughs while maintaining a single 
municipal authority would be raised in the negotiations with the 
Palestinians. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir asked the deputy 
minister if the Vatican responded to Foreign Minister Peres' 
letter to the Norwegian foreign minister on Jerusalem. The 
Likud views it as strengthening the assumption that 
responsibility for the Christian and Muslim holy places in 
Jerusalem would be handed over to the Palestinians. Beilin said 
that the Vatican did not refer to the Peres letter, but asked to 
be a partner to all negotiations on the Jerusalem holy places.

<F P=106> [Report by Moti Bassok] </F>
  [Excerpts] The prime minister's bureau has recently been 
emptying of its senior officials, and the prime minister is not 
taking care to fill the ranks. The last person to leave was 
Jacques Neriya, the prime minister's political adviser. 
  Several days ago Neriya advised Rabin of his intention to 
leave the bureau. He will join the new secretary general of the 
Histadrut labor federation, Hayim Ramon, and will head the 
Histadrut International Affairs Department. [passage omitted] 
  Neriya's resignation was the last in a series of 
resignations 
from Rabin's bureau over the past several weeks. Hayim Asa, who 
was slated to head the national security team at the Prime 
Minister's Office, was recently forced to resign. Asa charged 
that Shim'on Sheves, Prime Minister's Office director general, 
and Eytan Haber, head of Rabin's bureau, the two most senior 
aides to Rabin, were to blame for his resignation. According to 
Asa, the two are preventing other bureau employees, including 
very senior ones, from having access to and contacts with Rabin, 
thus harming the bureau's proper working procedures. The 
officials who left Rabin's bureau over the past six weeks are: 
Cabinet Secretary Elyaqim Rubinstein; Gad Ben-Ari, the prime 
minister's media adviser; Attorney Nira Poran, adviser on 
information and public affairs; and Colonel 'Amos Gil'ad, the 
prime minister's army affairs adviser. 
  Despite this mass desertion in a relatively short period of 
time, none of the evacuated posts has been permanently manned -- 
although the posts are most important and some are very 
sensitive, and despite the fact that candidates who are 
considered to have particularly good backgrounds and potential 
offered themselves for all of the posts. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 13 June 
reports that "Shim'on Sheves, the director general of the Prime 
Minister's Office, denied that Jacques Neriya, the prime 
minister's political adviser intends to resign from his post. 
Sheves confirmed that Hayim Ramon had offered Neriya a senior 
position in the Histadrut labor federation several weeks ago; 
however, Neriya had not given Ramon a positive answer. In an 
interview with Qol Yisra'el, Sheves denied that advisers were 
resigning from the prime minister's bureau en masse, and said 
that everyone leaving was had viable and different reasons."]

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Marcus: "The Eunuchs and the </F>
Castrated"] 
  [Text] Upon being discharged from the hospital Hayim 
Haberfeld expressed his disappointment that the prime minister 
had not inquired about his condition, visited him, or phoned him 
even once. "I have never seen such a thing in all my years in 
politics," said the man who lost four toes to diabetes, as well 
as the Histadrut labor federation elections. Of course, it was 
all Haberfeld's mistake. If instead of lying in the hospital he 
threw a cocktail party and included trendy clothes designers, 
hairdressers, businessmen, industrialists, and several sycophant 
journalists among his guests, not only would he have received a 
phone call, but the royal couple themselves would have honored 
him with their presence. 
  Did we say royal? Well, it is no slip of the pen. We have 
seen all sorts of regimes in this country -- a semi-messianic 
regime, a semi-bolshevik regime, a semi-chaotic regime, a 
full-blown down-to-earth regime, and a full-blown 
pomp-and-circumstance regime a la Ze'ev Jabotinsky -- but we 
have never had any regime as monarchical as Rabin's. However, 
contrary to present-day monarchs who are mostly symbolic figures 
in ornate uniforms, Rabin sees himself as an anointed autocrat, 
like the kings of ancient history. 
  Haberfeld served as secretary general of the Histadrut for 
only 19 months, but paid the cumulative price of the mistakes 
committed by Labor and the government with regard to the Qupat 
Holim sick fund. Primarily, however, he paid the price of 
Rabin's personal failure in the Ramon affair. Only the 
government, which allowed the situation to deteriorate to such a 
point, is to blame for Qupat Holim's woes and the suffering that 
will be inflicted on its three million customers in the next few 
months. Instead of being angry with itself, however, the throne 
is angry with Haberfeld. Had this happened a few centuries ago, 
he would probably have been beheaded in the town square, seeing 
as how in the Byzantine court that surrounds the prime minister 
only one person is right while all the rest are guilty and 
losers. 
  More than one foreign journalist has recently expressed 
surprise that the government's popularity in public opinion 
polls is not soaring in spite of its peace policy. Quite the 
contrary, a feeling of despondency (or "down syndrome," as one 
journalist put it) hovers over the country. Rabin's men 
attribute this to a mid-term crisis (apparently fashioned after 
a mid-life crisis) but I doubt this is a passing mood. This is 
a confidence crisis caused by the gap between the arrogance 
projected by the prime minister's court and the gradual collapse 
of the main elements that instill a sense of confidence in the 
citizens (housing, jobs, health, and pension). We will reap the 
fruits of Gaza-Jericho only in the distant future, if it has a 
follow-up. But, when it comes to the well-being of the 
citizens, the feeling at present is one of hopelessness. 
  Although there is as yet no evidence that the state health 
law will provide the population with better health care, what we 
are witnessing now is a retreat to Qupat Holim's darkest days. 
Pension funds, the bedrock of security for wage-earners in 
their old age, are on the verge of collapsing. In many places, 
the economic hardships are unbearable and the chances of buying 
a house are growing dimmer by the day. Thousands of learned 
analyses about the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will not alter what 
seems to be the real reason for what is happening there: a 
basic lack of faith in the government's promises to improve the 
economy. Shulamit Aloni is right when she says that "Labor is 
in a state of deterioration." Highway overpasses do not build a 
country. 
  The nature of the regime emerging in the second reign of 
Rabin the First is largely to blame. The court consists of two 
types of royal advisers: the eunuchs and the castrated. The 
former are Rabin's closest advisers, who have learned from 
experience that only by being yes-men will they keep their 
positions, seeing that the prime minister absolutely abhors 
anybody giving him advice that conflicts with his own views. 
Although they are mere clerks, his minions intimidate cabinet 
ministers and other elected officials. Neither in the infamous 
days of MAPAI [Israel Workers Party, a Labor precursor] nor in 
the days of Begin, who was regarded as a demigod, was there a 
court so manipulative of the media, so intolerant of criticism, 
and so imperious on the personal and political level. 
  It goes without saying that the castrated are elected 
officials and prominent Labor members who are cabinet ministers. 
It is hard to recall another elected government that was so 
subservient to, so scared of, and so groveling to the prime 
minister as the current one. The nation's leaders are divided 
into several categories: Those to whom Rabin is indebted to but 
does not care about, those he cannot stand, those he does not 
appreciate, thoes he scorns, and those he would gladly fire from 
their jobs if his ability to make decisions was anything like 
his ability to look down on his colleagues in the government. 
What all of them have as a common denominator is that although 
they bear collective responsibility, none of them has the 
foggiest idea of what is going on -- they are not consulted on 
either strategy, tactics, or the considerations deciding the 
fate of the country, except for those occasions when Rabin needs 
a rubber stamp. 
  And so it has come to pass that at this time unto Israel 
there is a king. But where is the leadership?

<F P=106> [Article by Ari'el Sharon: "Why Now?"] </F>
  [Text] Irrational antagonism has been and is an emotion 
shared by the two political blocs. I have observed it both here 
and there. When it rages, falsification, distortions, and 
deception occur. "Heavy guns" are either engaged, or give their 
assistance freely; they range from absent-minded professors down 
to self-anointed orientalists, from a journalist who shot his 
own hand during the war to another who has written one thing and 
its opposite several times over. 
  I do not propose to waste my time on any of these, nor on 
some Knesset activists who have been vigorously demanding my 
ousting from the Likud. For my part, I intend to leave them all 
in and to cooperate with all of them. With each on the merit of 
his talents and capabilities. Because what we need is unity. 
  I believe I represent the Likud stands in the political, 
security, settlement, economic, and social spheres. 
  I owe them no explanation. I do owe one to the many 
thousands of ordinary Likud members who wonder why I have 
spoken up, and why now. 
  The security situation is deteriorating. The government 
argues that this is the much-desired peace, but meanwhile, it is 
sowing seeds of war. Jerusalem is turning into the Palestinian 
state's capital before our very eyes, yet the government is 
doing nothing to prevent it. The danger is right here. And the 
Likud is paralyzed. It is 1994, yet the Likud is still talking 
about the 1977 autonomy. 
  This is what caused my rallying at this time to avert the 
war 
in which the government is liable to entangle us. I want to try 
to unite the large national bloc, which must launch action at 
once. 
  First of all, the political process must be halted, and 
withdrawal should be stopped. No more withdrawal. Terrorism is 
to be tackled seriously and eliminated before it causes war in 
the heart of Israeli cities. We must regain full control of 
Jerusalem and rid it of the incipient "Palestinian government 
complex." We must enhance our hold over the entire city. 
  All national bloc factions must start formulating a 
clear-cut 
political plan at once . 
  "He is a schemer: He plotted against Begin and against 
Shamir, and now he is plotting against me." [Netanyahu's 
remarks about Sharon] No humility whatsoever. The comparison 
to Mr. Begin, even to Mr. Shamir, is pretentious and ludicrous. 
  True, I often argued with Mr. Begin when I served on his 
government. For instance, I totally disagreed with him on the 
matter of autonomy, which will commence the establishment of a 
second Palestinian state. 
  Conversely, I helped him make peace with Egypt, set up 
settlements, make the difficult decision to bomb the nuclear 
reactor in Baghdad, and wage a war on 'Arafat and the PLO in 
Lebanon. Is that scheming? 
  I intensely disagreed with Mr. Shamir, who committed a 
momentous, historical error in consenting to participate in the 
Madrid conference without demanding, as precondition, that the 
arms race be arrested, that terrorist organizations disbanded, 
and the Palestinian refugees problem resolved in countries of 
their current residence. I further disagreed with his 
unwillingness to fight the intifadah with appropriate means, 
with his inuring the nation to the existence of terror victims 
as a matter of fact, and with his allowing the establishment of 
the PLO's government residence in Orient House in Jerusalem. Is 
that scheming? 
  Jewish history will not pardon his two blunders: his failure 
to nip the intifadah in the bud and to prevent the establishment 
of the Palestinian government's residence, both of which 
occurred while he was prime minister, and both of which could 
have been prevented. We may disagree with the prime minister, 
and sometimes it is our duty to do so. 
  "Sharon was unable to obey authority in other 
frameworks, too," Mr. Shamir added. 
  I would like to tell you about the other frameworks, of 
which 
Mr. Shamir is apparently oblivious. 
  In the 1950's, I insisted that successful retaliation 
operations could be staged, and I carried them out. I was one 
of the few generals who insisted, who were absolutely certain 
that we would win the Six-Day War. And it came to pass, and I 
shared in it, and I was successful. 
  In 1973, I insisted that the Suez Canal could be traversed, 
that failure could be turned into victory, and I did it. I 
insisted on driving 'Arafat and his terrorists out of Beirut, 
and they were indeed driven out. 
  At one time, I insisted on establishing the Likud, and 
despite the contempt and derision, I was successful, enabling a 
new regime to rise to power for the first time in Israel's 
history. 
  I insisted that 100,000 apartments could be built and that 
tens of thousands of other apartments could be renovated in a 
short period, in a bid to resolve the housing problems of 
hundreds of thousands of immigrants and homeless Israeli 
families, and I did build them. 
  "He is seeking rehabilitation," they said. 
  I am not the one who should seek rehabilitation. I never 
needed it. Those who brought Palestinian terrorism into Israel 
-- the same people who conducted a hideous, dangerous, unethical 
political campaign during the Peace for Galilee war [Lebanon 
war] -- they are the ones who need rehabilitation. And they 
will never have it. 
  "It is undemocratic; a candidate has already been 
elected," they argue. 
  The new leadership has been granted a whole year of grace, 
not the customary 100 days. I would have been happy had they 
been able to do their job. Unfortunately, this leadership has 
been unable to unite the ranks and launch a genuine political 
struggle against the government's foul-ups. 
  As will be remembered, Likud leaders correctly contended 
only 
weeks after the last elections that although it had been 
democratically elected, this government should be replaced, 
because it did not have a mandate to carry out the drastic 
actions it was attempting. I would like to ask you: Am I to be 
forbidden to demand of my party, the Likud, which I cofounded, 
the same thing the Likud leadership rightfully demanded on a 
national level, namely -- new elections? 
  "Sharon did not participate in votes on no-confidence 
motions, the highest expression of anti government 
struggle," the chairman further cried out. 
  I participated in some, in other instances my absence was 
offset by the other side, and as for the thing in general, it 
has long become a hopeless farce. 
  Only people who have never built a house, planted a 
vineyard, 
plowed a field, or paved a road can think that words are "the 
highest expression" of anything. Action is the supreme 
expression of anti government action, as is the bolstering of 
Jewish settlement throughout Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, 
Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, and the Jordan Rift Valley. 
  More families in settlements, new roads connecting 
settlements, new kindergartens, the absorption of immigrants, 
strengthening Israel's last defense line against withdrawal to 
the 1948 borders. An indefatigable information campaign abroad 
-- this is the main struggle, and this is what preoccupies me. 
  "His move will harm unity and the Likud's prospects of 
returning to power," they add. 
  On the contrary, unity will grow. I have proposed 
establishing a united national bloc, a "superbloc" while 
maintaining the framework of existing parties. The joint 
appearance will give the national bloc an enormous impetus and 
bring it many new supporters. If open primaries are held by 
members of the entire national bloc and its supporters, one 
candidate acceptable to all will be elected. 
  "He brought on the downfall of the previous 
government," they spin their yarn. 
  The responsibility for the Likud government's downfall lies 
with the team that ran the elections, and those people are the 
ones who are spreading false rumors today. They conducted an 
bungling election campaign. They refused to display 
achievements -- and there were many of those -- out of 
"extraneous" internal considerations. Knowingly, they initiated 
the split in the Likud camp already during the preliminary party 
elections. They wanted an "attractive Likud," they sought "to 
restore the Likud's old glory," and they are still pursuing 
their quest today. 
  "In what way are you abler or better?" they ask. 
  The question is not whether I am better or abler, but rather 
whether I am more experienced. 
  What matters today is not the personal fate of one candidate 
or another, what matters is the fate of the country.

  [Text] The Arrow antiballistic missile has been launched 
successfully. In the eighth test of the Arrow system, the 
attacking missile passed close to the target missile. Its 
warhead exploded, fragments hit the target as planned, and for 
the first time ever succeeded in blowing it up. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda reports that 
the launch was conducted from a ship not far from central 
Israel's seashore.

  [Text] The Council of Ministers held a meeting at 1100 
today under Prime Minister Mahmud al-Zu'bi and reviewed the work 
of the services and economic committees. 
  During the session, the Council of Ministers was briefed by 
Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' on current developments in both 
the Arab and international arenas. The foreign minister 
clarified the nature and aims of the pressures being put on 
Syria in order to harm its pan-Arab and national decision, 
stressing that Syria firmly adheres to its positions and trends 
to achieve a just and comprehensive peace and that it will not 
relinquish any national or pan-Arab rights. 
  In this context, the foreign minister also explained that 
the 
aim of the Israelis is to force the peace process from its 
course and its true goals and to push it onto a thorny and 
deadlocked road. He also asserted that the continued Israeli 
intransigence is aimed at weakening current international 
efforts to push the peace process forward, ignoring the 
resolutions of international legitimacy, and blocking the peace 
process. 
  The foreign minister then reviewed the results of the 
meetings that were held in Damascus to promote Syria's 
cooperation with the Russian Federation, the PRC, and India. He 
also touched on the positive results of the meeting of the 
nonaligned foreign ministers in Cairo, stressing the importance 
of the movement's role in protecting the interests of the 
nonaligned countries in the absence of democratic relations in 
the international arena. 
  The Council of Ministers also discussed the draft law on 
implementing a trade agreement with the Vietnamese Government, 
as well as the draft law on amending some articles of the mail 
and parcels law No. 470 of 1957. It also studied issues on its 
agenda, as well as subjects under discussion, and made 
appropriate decisions.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: Yitzhaq Rabin has admitted that there is 
a big gap between the Syrian and Israeli stands vis-a-vis peace 
in the Middle East. Meanwhile, he reiterated that Syria will be 
committing a big mistake if it believes that the United States 
will exert any pressure on Israel. Rabin wanted to say that 
Israeli intransigence will continue and that his government will 
not make any change in its policy rejecting the Security Council 
resolutions. 
  The Israeli stands, which are hostile to the peace process 
and to the spirit and bases of the Madrid conference, have not 
surprised Syria because Israel was established on a policy of 
aggression, usurpation, and expansion. Syria, however, 
participated in the peace process and responded to the U.S. 
initiative, proceeding from definite bases -- namely, exchanging 
land for peace, implementing the Security Council resolutions, 
and achieving a just and comprehensive settlement on all fronts 
of conflict. 
  Syria has worked over the past two and a half years to 
render 
the Washington talks a success, saved the peace process more 
than once from intentional Israeli destruction, and facilitated 
the task of U.S. envoys in the region. Since the United States 
has reiterated -- through President Bill Clinton and Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher -- its commitment to go ahead in the 
peace process in accordance with its bases, Syria has the right 
to ask the United States keep its promise and play the fair role 
of full partner. Syria understands that fairness achieves rights 
and entrenches justice. Syria does not, at all, call on the 
United States to become biased toward Syria; it wants the United 
States to be biased toward the Security Council resolutions and 
the principles of the international laws that ban occupation of 
land by force, any change in the land's cultural, historical, 
and demographic features, and the law of jungle. 
  In view of Israel's history, which is full of wars, 
aggressions, and massacres; in light of the clear maneuvers and 
procrastination it showed in Washington; and given its rejection 
of the requirements of the peace process -- particularly full 
withdrawal from the occupied territory -- Syria will continue to 
ask the United States to fulfill its guarantees and its 
commitment to play a fair role. Syria believes there is no way 
to achieve peace in the Middle East without effective American 
intervention in the interest of the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  All the world hopes will not convince Israel to make one 
single step toward achieving peace if this step is not 
accompanied by the appropriate pressure. The current situation 
should prompt the entire international community to make an 
urgent move to end the present stalemate in the Washington talks. 
  Israel will commit a grave mistake if it believes that Syria 
will, ultimately, succumb to its blackmailing, twisted methods, 
partial settlements and relinquish one single inch of the Golan. 
  The Golan has been Syrian land from the beginning of 
history, 
and Syria will not relinquish one single inch of its land and 
will not bargain over its sovereignty. It neither relinquishes 
Arab rights or bargains over them. If peace is not fair or 
comprehensive, and if it does not end Israeli occupation of all 
occupied territory it will remain a temporary deal that will be 
destroyed by acceleration of events.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today, AL-BA'TH talks about 
Israel's attempts to harm the distinguished Syrian-Lebanese 
relations with the aim of dealing separately with each country 
within the framework of its attempts to impose its hegemony on 
the region and its conditions that serve the Israeli greed and 
interests. 
  AL-BA'TH says Israel is still wagering on the internal 
Lebanese situation. The series of explosions--the latest of 
which took place at Sayyidat al-Najat Church--, the daily 
aggressions against southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and the many 
enticements offered to Lebanon are aimed to sever the bonds 
between two twin states. 
  AL-BA'TH says Israel concentrates on Lebanon, which had been 
viewed as the weakest part of the Arab body, as part of its 
policy of secret deals and partial solutions. 
  AL-BA'TH emphasizes that Lebanon, which astonished the world 
with its national resistance of the Zionist occupation, has 
practiced its legitimate right to defend and liberate its land. 
Hence, it is no longer the weakest part. Furthermore, Lebanon 
plays an important role in the peace process in coordination 
with Syria, and emphasizes that it will not relinquish any of 
its rights. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH says the continuous 
Syrian-Lebanese consultations consolidate fraternal bonds 
between the two sisterly states and the one people, and 
strengthen the Syrian and Lebanese negotiators and enable them 
to confront all Israeli methods. This was emphasized by 
Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi during their summit uesterday 
when they reiterated adherence to a just and comprehensive 
solution.

has reiterated -- through President Bill Clinton and Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher -- its commitment to go ahead in the 
peace process in accordance with its bases, Syria has the right 
to ask the United States keep its promise and play the fair role 
of full partner. Syria understands that fairness achieves rights 
and entrenches justice. Syria does not, at all, call on the 
United States to become biased toward Syria; it wants the United 
States to be biased toward the Security Council resolutions and 
the principles of the international laws that ban occupation of 
land by force, any change in the land's cultural, historical, 
and demographic features, and the law of jungle. 
  In view of Israel's history, which is full of wars, 
aggressions, and massacres; in light of the clear maneuvers and 
procrastination it showed in Washington; and given its rejection 
of the requirements of the peace process -- particularly full 
withdrawal from the occupied territory -- Syria will continue to 
ask the United States to fulfill its guarantees and its 
commitment to play a fair role. Syria believes there is no way 
to achieve peace in the Middle East without effective American 
intervention in the interest of the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  All the world hopes will not convince Israel to make one 
single step toward achieving peace if this step is not 
accompanied by the appropriate pressure. The current situation 
should prompt the entire international community to make an 
urgent move to end the present stalemate in the Washington talks. 
  Israel will commit a grave mistake if it believes that Syria 
will, ultimately, succumb to its blackmailing, twisted methods, 
partial settlements and relinquish one single inch of the Golan. 
  The Golan has been Syrian land from the beginning of 
history, 
and Syria will not relinquish one single inch of its land and 
will not bargain over its sovereignty. It neither relinquishes 
Arab rights or bargains over them. If peace is not fair or 
comprehensive, and if it does not end Israeli occupation of all 
occupied territory it will remain a temporary deal that will be 
destroyed by acceleration of events.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In its editorial today, AL-BA'TH talks about 
Israel's attempts to harm the distinguished Syrian-Lebanese 
relations with the aim of dealing separately with each country 
within the framework of its attempts to impose its hegemony on 
the region and its conditions that serve the Israeli greed and 
interests. 
  AL-BA'TH says Israel is still wagering on the internal 
Lebanese situation. The series of explosions--the latest of 
which took place at Sayyidat al-Najat Church--, the daily 
aggressions against southern Lebanon and al- Biqa', and the many 
enticements offered to Lebanon are aimed to sever the bonds 
between two twin states. 
  AL-BA'TH says Israel concentrates on Lebanon, which had been 
viewed as the weakest part of the Arab body, as part of its 
policy of secret deals and partial solutions. 
  AL-BA'TH emphasizes that Lebanon, which astonished the world 
with its national resistance of the Zionist occupation, has 
practiced its legitimate right to defend and liberate its land. 
Hence, it is no longer the weakest part. Furthermore, Lebanon 
plays an important role in the peace process in coordination 
with Syria, and emphasizes that it will not relinquish any of 
its rights. 
  Concluding its comment, AL-BA'TH says the continuous 
Syrian-Lebanese consultations consolidate fraternal bonds 
between the two sisterly states and the one people, and 
strengthen the Syrian and Lebanese negotiators and enable them 
to confront all Israeli methods. This was emphasized by 
Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi during their summit uesterday 
when they reiterated adherence to a just and comprehensive 
solution.

  [Text] The two-day AICC-I [All India Congress Committee-I] 
session has concluded with a call to find technology which can 
produce quality goods in the small-scale sector. Addressing the 
concluding session this evening in New Delhi, the party 
president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, said this is necessary for 
adopting Gandhian philosophy in the present context and to 
overcome the problem of social costs associated with this 
industry. He called upon the developed countries to join hands 
with developing nations in this campaign and said such programs 
should be innovative and time bound. 
  Making a dig at the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] for its 
demand that India should go nuclear, Mr. Rao reiterated that the 
country would keep its options open. The decision will be based 
on disarmament trends in the world. We cannot play with weapons 
of mass destruction, he observed. Mr. Rao said there can be no 
question of one upmanship in this matter. He charged some 
political parties with misleading the people over the issue. 
Mr. Narasimha Rao underlined the need for strengthening the 
party's setup at the village level in a time bound manner. The 
Congress-I president said that the practice of giving party 
tickets to the relatives of leaders should be stopped as it has 
created resentment among the rank and file.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has reiterated that 
Pakistan intends to highlight the Kashmir issue at the 
international level, but it will keep the doors open for 
bilateral negotiations to resolve the issue. 
  In an interview with the Dubayy daily KHALEEJ TIMES, she 
referred to the changes in the global scenario, saying things 
that seemed impossible in the Middle East, South Africa, 
Cambodia, and Somalia have now become possible. She said 
Pakistan and India cannot remain passive and allow this region 
to be a center of tension. Referring to her efforts to find a 
solution to the issue, she said that by expressing its 
willingness to hold the foreign secretary-level talks that took 
place in Islamabad, Pakistan paved the way for negotiations. 
This demonstrates our determination to solve this problem on a 
bilateral basis. She said, however, that Pakistan does not want 
to make bilateral talks an excuse for crushing the Kashmiris. 
Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan has made several other proposals, 
such as a reduction of forces in Jammu and Kashmir; the 
abrogation of barbaric legislation in the occupied valley; the 
release of the Hurriat Conference leaders; and permission for 
human rights groups, the international mass media, and diplomats 
to visit Kashmir. 
  Answering a question, she said another extremely important 
element of Pakistan's foreign policy is improving its relations 
with the United States through meaningful talks. The prime 
minister said Pakistan does not want these relations to be 
limited to the single aspect of the nuclear issue; we want to 
make these relations multidimensional. Referring to the 
Pressler law, she said Pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon 
and has demonstrated a great deal of perseverance and restraint 
by refraining from detonating a nuclear explosion. Pakistan has 
decided not to exceed the existing limits unless its existence 
is threatened. Thus, from a legal point of view, Pakistan has 
not violated the Pressler law. She said this law has assumed 
the form of a veto that is in India's hands. Benazir Bhutto said 
Pakistan welcomes the Clinton administration's policy of 
controlling, reducing, and eliminating nuclear programs at the 
regional level. On the issue of the F-16 aircraft, she said 
Pakistan should receive these aircraft because it was a 
commercial deal and Pakistan has already paid for them. 
Pakistan should get the F-16's or the money should be refunded.

  [Text] The Iranian-German joint economic commission will 
meet in Germany next fall. This was stated yesterday by Foreign 
Minister Velayati who is in Germany. Velayati also described 
his two-day talks with the German chancellor and other 
high-ranking German officials as useful and constructive. 
Velayati, who was speaking during an interview with the Central 
News Unit correspondent in Bonn last night, referred to the 
noteworthy developments in Tehran-Bonn relations during recent 
years and said: These relations can be used as a good example 
for other European countries concerning bilateral relations with 
the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
  Velayati said that main points of his discussions with 
German 
officials during this visit included the formation of a joint 
economic commission next fall, the continuation of cooperation 
in international forums, Germany's more active participation in 
Iran's Second [Five-Year] Economic Plan, the formation of the 
two countries' cultural assembly, and parliamentary cooperation 
between Tehran and Bonn. 
  The foreign minister said that the regular contacts between 
the Iranian and German heads of state over the past two years 
have constituted an important element in advancing the two 
countries' relations. 
  Commenting on the impact of Iranian-German relations on 
global and regional developments, Velayati said: [Begin 
Velayati recording via telephone] Iranian-German cooperation has 
gone beyond bilateral relations and has assumed regional and 
international dimensions. As the current head of the ECO 
[Economic Cooperation Organization], and as current head of 
united Europe, Germany will hold talks in the future on 
cooperation between these two regional bodies. Europe, with its 
greater experience and vast dimensions of cooperation, and Iran 
-- especially after the expansion of ECO, which is a young 
organization -- can use Europe's experiences, and cooperation 
between the two organizations will be extremely positive and 
constructive. 
  We have agreed to hold a joint session next fall in New York 
with the troika on the foreign ministerial level. The troika is 
actually the presidency of the European Union and consists of 
former, current, and future foreign ministers of countries 
acting as EU presidents. They participate in meetings with 
other countries and actually mold the European Community's 
foreign relations. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says Israel is waiting 
for PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to assume control in Gaza and 
Jericho before it continues negotiations with the PLO. The 
prime minister spoke at a news conference in Haifa last night. 
Sylvia Leaf reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Leaf] Yasir 'Arafat will be allowed to 
enter Gaza and Jericho whenever he wishes, Prime Minister Rabin 
told reporters, but he must also assume responsibility over the 
Palestinian authorities. 
  [Rabin] At this stage, I am focusing to see how the PLO, 
through the Palestinian Authority, succeed to take over and to 
control, in accordance to their commitment to us on the DOP 
[Document of Principles] and the Cairo agreement, to fulfill 
their parts. Before that, I will not pass any judgment. 
  [Leaf] Regarding a peace agreement with Syria, the prime 
minister said the Syrians believe that America can influence 
Israel against her will, and this attitude won't succeed. He 
stressed that solutions can be found only when agreed upon by 
both Israel and Syria. 
  The prime minister said the recent closure of the 
territories 
to Arab workers has resulted in the employment of a further 
25,000 Israelis in the building industry. Justifying his 
authorization of work permits for 25,000 Palestinians from the 
territories, Rabin pointed out that in the past year, no 
terrorist attacks have been carried out in Israel by 
Palestinians permitted to work here. [end recording]

  [Text] The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] president, Mr. L.K. 
Advani, says India should exercise the nuclear option for 
national security and to prevent any attempt of intimidation of 
neighbors and superpowers. Addressing the three-day national 
council meeting of the party in Wadodara this morning, he warned 
of dangers to the country arising out of, what he termed, the 
U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. Mr. Advani also alleged that the 
policies of the Narasimha Rao government will affect both the 
economic and security interest of the nation. The BJP president 
said behind the nonproliferation initiative of the United States 
is the assumption that India must subcontract its national 
security to Washington. He said western influences, particularly 
American interests, shape the debate on nuclear arms and missile 
system. Mr. Advani said his party is opposed to the 
globalization policies of the government. He called for a 
reversal of the priorities and said that foreign trade and 
investment should only be useful supplements to national effort. 
  More than 300 delegates are attending the national council 
session which began this morning. Prominent leaders attending 
the meeting include Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee and Mr. Murli 
Manohar Joshi.

<F P=106> [Article by Nikhil Chakraborty] </F>
  [Text] What are the problems being faced by Narasimha Rao 
at home after his visit to the United States? This is the 
question being raised today. The prime minister's visit to the 
United States is a matter of honor to the ruling and the 
opposition parties. 
  The opposition parties had raised questions in the 
parliament 
with the apprehensions that the Narasimha Rao government would 
probably succumb to the American pressure on the stalemate on 
signing Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, human rights, and the 
Kashmir issue. Their voices in the parliament convinced the 
prime minister that he should clearly apprise the Clinton 
administration of the Indian stance on these issues and should 
return home without succumbing to any pressure. Besides, being 
a prime minister with a slight majority in the parliament, 
Narasimha Rao was in a suicidal situation, if he would bow down 
to any such pressures. It is a matter of gratification that 
Narasimha Rao was firm on very important issues and clarified 
India's points in his address at the American Congress. 
  Now nobody can find fault with the prime minister and say 
that he failed in putting forward national issues. Another 
significant feature is that the prime minister made his position 
amply clear. Does this mean that the differences with the 
United States have been completely overcome? No. We have 
presented our contradicting views in a slightly different manner 
at the talks held with the U.S. President. In other words, we 
have made it clear that we will be by and large friendly even 
though differences of opinion persist. 
  At the Indo-U.S. summit-level talks, differences existed, 
especially on Pakistan and the nuclear weapons issue. President 
Clinton's statement confirmed that he endorses Islamabad's views 
and Benazir Bhutto's statements that Pakistan does not supply 
arms to the extremists to help the secessionist forces in 
Kashmir. At the same time, the United States did not accept 
Pakistan's contention that India does not have any right in 
Kashmir, as the extremists have an upper hand there. It has 
supported the view that Pakistan and India should hold bilateral 
talks under the Simla agreement. This indicates the United 
States position that it wants to support neither Pakistan nor 
India in this matter. 
  Besides saying that Kashmir does not belong to India, U.S. 
Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel also spoke about human 
rights abuses in Kashmir. Islamabad has also been voicing the 
same concern. However, now the issue of human rights abuses 
rears its head in Washington infrequently. Washington does not 
want to have too much discussion with India on the human rights 
issue. Now, the United States has retraced its steps from 
criticizing India on the human rights issue. This shift in 
stance was noticed earlier at the UN Human Rights Commision 
conference in Geneva. There, the U.S. representative did not 
support Pakistan's resolution against India, and he kept quiet. 
Thus, the United States' behavior of changing its stance 
whimsically on the issue of human rights abuses is not a 
surprising thing nor something new. Earlier, there was strong 
criticism against the Chinese Government for cracking down on 
innocent students at Tiananmen Square in 1989. However, when it 
was the question of commercial cooperation, the United States 
did not hesitate to grant Most Favored Nation status to China. 
  On the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] issue, the gap 
between New Delhi and Washington has not been bridged. This 
issue was not included at the Washington talks as India has been 
saying that the NPT was discriminatory. It clearly shows that 
both countries have different perceptions on this issue. 
However, the United States wants to resolve the nuclear 
nonproliferation issue through talks at the regional level. 
This implies the United States' position that Pakistan and 
India can hold talks on the issue. However, India is of the 
view that this issue should be discussed nor resolved at global 
level. In other words, India's stand is that nuclear 
nonproliferation cannot be achieved by the reduction of nuclear 
weapons by some countries through regional-level or bilateral 
talks. 
  Therefore, although differences persist between them, the 
United States and India have come to the conclusion that the 
issue should be resolved through continuous bilateral talks. 
Nuclear nonproliferation is the most significant element of the 
Clinton administration's foreign policy. However, the behavior 
and activities of the corporate bodies in the United States have 
a say in the final decision of the Clinton administration. 
  That is why the United States had to play a dubious role and 
devise its policies in China's matter. As far as India is 
concerned, in the joint statement issued by President Clinton 
and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, both countries expressed their 
willingness to strike a "new partnership". This term has not 
been used with any member of the Atlantic family. [sentence as 
published] It can be construed that the interest evinced by 
American megacompanies to grab India's colossal markets and 
encourage investment there is the cause for issuing this term. 
  Keeping this in mind, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao called on 
the directors of megacompanies in New York, Houston, and 
Washington during his visit. This approach has never been used 
by any other prime minister of India. These meetings were 
arranged as a prelude to the meetings in coming years, maybe 
within a few months. 
  American companies are making efforts to grab the 
opportunities available in India before the companies from the 
European Community or Japan take the initiative and seize the 
markets. 
  Following the mega American companies, nonresident Indians 
are showing keen interest to invest in their motherland in this 
regard. 
  After great calculations, Indian authorities speculate that 
the nonresident Indians will also invest in a big way, if 
American companies start investing in Indian markets. That is 
why, in various states, local affinity is getting stronger. The 
tendency to invest according to the origin of the investors such 
as Bengalis, Gujarathis, Punjabis, and Maharashtrians, is 
becoming conspicuous now. 
  With a view to bring American capital to the country, the 
prime minister has extended an invitation to the nonresident 
Indians to invest in India. This has been viewed as an act of 
gambling. Any outside intervention is a matter of great anxiety 
to the Indians. When the gigantic American companies like Ford, 
General Motors, or Exxon establish their sway in India and if, 
out of a sheer sense of patriotism, there is a call for 
sponsoring only indigenous goods in the country, it cannot be 
easily rejected. Because, when economic forces join political 
forces to gain influence and if politicians back it, it will be 
a challenge to the honor of the country. Under these 
circumstances, corruption at higher levels will assume alarming 
proportions and will bury the system of democracy itself.

  [Text] Parliament has approved two bills providing for 
deterrent punishment to hijackers. The Lok Sabha adopted the 
bills yesterday which were approved by the Rajya Sabha earlier. 
The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, said the new 
legislation provides for the setting up of designated courts for 
speedy trial of hijacking and other related offences. Bail will 
not be granted without hearing the prosecution. Another salient 
feature is that the burden of proof will be that of the accused 
in cases where arms and explosives used for hijacking are 
recovered. The center can now delegate the investigative powers 
to any of its agencies instead of the local police. 
  The Lok Sabha has also passed the Human Organs 
Transplantation Bill seeking to regulate removal and 
transplantation of human organs. Already passed by the Rajya 
Sabha, the bill received support from all sections of the house 
and was adopted with certain official amendments in line with 
some of the recommendations of the select committee of the 
house. Replying to the debate, the deputy minister for health, 
Mr. Pawan Singh Ghatewal, said with the passage of the bill 
other states would follow suit to enact their own laws. He said 
such provisions are now available in the states of Maharashtra, 
Goa, and Himachal Pradesh. Participating in the discussion, 
members welcomed the measure but cautioned the government to 
ensure that the provisions of the bill should not be misused by 
unscrupulous elements for illegal trading in human organs. 
  The house also passed the New Delhi Municipal Council Bill 
yesterday along with some amendments. The proposed council will 
have 11 members besides a chairperson. The council includes 
three MLAs [Members of Legislative Assembly] and the MP 
representing the New Delhi area. 
  Later, the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die. The house sat 
late last night to pass six bills. The special session which 
was summoned to consider the electoral reform bills ended ahead 
of schedule as the government did not introduce the Constitution 
Amendment Bill regarding electoral reforms.

<F P=106> [Report by Artlette Khuri: "Paris Conference Concludes </F>
Meetings With Call for Transitional Government for Accord and 
Liberation"] 
  [Excerpts] Paris -- The "Lebanese National Conference" 
[LNC] yesterday concluded its meetings in Paris with a number of 
resolutions providing for the formation of a Constituent 
Committee to draw up the conference's bylaws, a Board of 
Trustees to replace that committee as soon as the board is 
formed, and a National Assembly to act as the legislative body. 
It also recommended the formation of a transitional government. 
  The resolutions, which were drafted after a series of 
contacts on the sidelines of the conference and in close 
consultation with former prime minister General Michel 'Awn who 
kept on introducing amendments to the draft resolutions until 
late at night the day before yesterday, stated that the LNC "is 
a comprehensive united establishment embodying the patriotic 
trend working for Lebanon's freedom, independence, and full 
sovereignty over all its territory with its historical and 
internationally recognized borders." [passage omitted] 
  The conference defined its "struggle priorities" by setting 
a 
number of targets including "liberation" through "expansion of 
the struggle work at Lebanese and international levels by 
mobilizing Lebanese resources in Lebanon and the diaspora." It 
also called for the mobilization [tajyish] of the Lebanese 
world's resources "in order to influence public opinion and the 
decisionmakers on Lebanese fateful issues, particularly the five 
permanent members of the Security Council, especially the United 
States, and also the Arab states which have no interest in 
sacrificing Lebanon's freedom, sovereignty, and independence." 
  The conference assigned to the Board of Trustees the task of 
pursuing dialogue and constitutional studies with prominent 
Lebanese and international experts to perceive and offer 
alternative options to the sectarian regime to pave the way for 
a political secular regime that would transfer power from the 
sects to the state and promulgate laws that would define the 
basic rights of the Lebanese citizen and offer a concept of a 
new structure for the state ensuring the executive independence 
of every authority as well as independent judicial control for 
every authority. 
  The conference asserted that the Arab-Israeli peace plan "is 
the most important diplomatic framework as far as Lebanon's fate 
is concerned and it would constitute a definite threat to 
Lebanon's sovereignty and independence if Lebanon went to the 
negotiations represented by a government whose decisions have 
been mortgaged and confiscated, a government which lacks 
legitimacy and public mandate." It renewed the call for 
"tripartite negotiations by Israel, Syria, and Lebanon." 
  It urged work for "solid and comprehensive Lebanese accord 
embracing the Lebanese leaderships which accept a negotiation 
plan for the full and absolute liberation of Lebanon, in the 
framework of a transitional government representing all parties 
which accept the principle of peace and work for it." The 
conference suggested that "the transitional government should, 
after completing the peace process and liberating Lebanon from 
every direct and indirect military and semimilitary presence, 
pass a new electoral law on which free parliamentary elections 
would be held under UN supervision, giving the right of voting 
and candidacy to all the Lebanese people at home and abroad."

  [Text] Sanaa, 15 Jun (INA)--The Saudi regime has mobilized 
military units near its common borders with Yemen, and placed 
them on high alert as part of its efforts to support the 
secessionists in Yemen. 
  Political sources in Sanaa revealed yesterday that the Saudi 
regime has mobilized 150 tanks in the Maydi area bordering Yemen 
[as received]. 
  The sources added that the Saudi regime, which has 
intensified its blatant interference in Yemeni domestic affairs 
by supplying the secessionists with military hardware, which is 
reaching them over land, by sea, and by air, has recently 
recruited large groups of mercenaries to support the 
secessionists besieged in Aden and al-Mukalla. 
  The Saudi regime is practicing repression against the 
Yemenis 
hailing from southern and eastern Yemeni governorates to make 
them join training camps launched to prepare them for fighting 
on the side of the secessionists in Yemen. 
  Political and diplomatic sources in the Yemeni capital, 
Sanaa, said that Saudi Arabia has earmarked large amounts of 
money for supporting the secessionists and tearing Yemeni unity 
apart. Saudi Arabia believes that it can, through arms deals 
and unlimited support for the secessionists, influence the 
course of the fighting and settle it in favor of the 
secessionists. 
  It is to be recalled that the Yemeni people believe that 
Yemeni unity is a sacred accomplishment, because it was achieved 
by their own free will. The Constitution of the Republic of 
Yemen was endorsed by the Yemenis in a public referendum on 16 
May 1990. This Constitution deems unity an eternal right for 
the Yemeni people. 
  The history of the Yemeni-Saudi conflict dates back to 70 
years ago, when the ruling Saudi family imposed the current 
borders on the al-Mutawakkilite kingdom, which ruled Yemen then. 
  The Saudi regime's concern for thwarting Yemeni unity has 
prompted it to launch an office managed and supervised by Saudi 
Defense Minister Sultan Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz. This office was 
launched to carry out acts of sabotage in Yemen and tear its 
unity asunder. Several billions of dollars have been earmarked 
for this office. 
  The Yemeni political sources noted that the Yemeni political 
crisis was engineered by the Saudis. This took place when 'Ai 
Salim al-Bid, leader of the secessionists, visited Saudi Arabia 
months after the realization of unity, and met with [King] Fahd, 
the leader of the Saudi regime. During that visit, al-Bid 
secretly promised Fahd to renege on unity in return for 
financial and economic support. 
  The Saudi regime is using this plan to put pressure on the 
Yemeni leadership, which has rejected the Saudi conditions for 
demarcating the common borders. The Saudis want the current 
borders to be the final borders. 
  Since 1934, Saudi Arabia has occupied three oil-rich Yemeni 
areas; namely, Jizan, 'Asir, and Najran, the area of which 
exceeds 300,000 square kilometers. Saudi Arabia has refused to 
return these Yemeni territories to Yemen.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, today received the ambassadors of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] member states to our country. 
The president asked the ambassadors to convey messages to his 
brothers the leaders of these states on developments in our 
country and issues concerning relations between our country and 
each of their states. 
  In his messages, the brother president stressed that what is 
going on in Yemen is an internal affair in which no party should 
interfere in order to ensure that the conflict will not be 
prolonged and to spare further Yemeni blood. The brother 
president urged his brothers the leaders of the GCC member 
states to do whatever is needed to preserve the Yemeni unity and 
stability in Yemen which will be in the interest of the Yemeni 
people and strengthen security and stability in the region. He 
stressed that the Yemeni unity is an important and basic element 
for stability in Yemen and the region and embodies the Arab 
nation's national objectives and supreme interests. He also 
stressed that preserving this unity is a pan- Arab 
responsibility as much as a Yemeni responsibility. 
  The brother leader noted the Republic of Yemen's eagerness 
to 
improve its strong brotherly ties with its sisterly GCC member 
states on the basis of mutual respect, good neighborliness, 
noninterference in internal affairs, and the positive 
cooperation that embodies the common aspirations of the Yemeni 
people and their brothers in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf.

  [Excerpt] The House of Representatives held an ordinary 
session this morning under Brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud, 
member of the House's Speakership Office. 
  At the outset of the session, the people's deputies reviewed 
and ratified the minutes of the previous session after urging 
and appealing to the government agencies to transport and 
distribute the basic food commodities available in large 
quantities at ports, mills, warehouses, and silos. These 
commodities, the House stressed, must be distributed to citizens 
in all governorates of the Republic of Yemen, and merchants and 
the public and private food suppliers must sell the commodities 
hoarded in their houses to the citizens at the official prices. 
The agencies charged with monitoring prices must fulfill their 
tasks in this and other fields, continuously and without showing 
any leniency. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with south Yemen "Defense Minister" Staff </F>
Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir by Lutfi Shatarah; place 
and date not given] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shatarah] You have on 
numerous occasions raised the question of Iraqi, Sudanese, 
Jordanian, and Eritrean involvement in the ongoing war between 
northern and southern forces. Is there irrefutable evidence of 
this involvement, given that Iraq says that the prisoners are 
teachers? 
  [Tahir] I can -- regrettably -- confirm to you that Iraq is 
implicated and a partner in this war against our people. Iraq 
is involved directly through its military experts and soldiers 
who are fighting alongside northern forces. A number of them 
have been captured, and Iraq could not deny this. The war is -- 
beyond any doubt -- basically run by Iraqi experts, and 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih considers himself a new Saddam, or as brother 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid described him, "a little Saddam." 
  We have irrefutable evidence of Jordan's implication in the 
war alongside 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and against our people in the 
Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. Sudan too is participating 
directly or indirectly in this war, proceeding from the close 
relations between Sudan and North Yemen, where parties, 
fundamentalist groups, and influential military leaders are in 
control of power. 
  And you know that Afghan jihad elements are fighting 
alongside northern forces on a number of fronts. 
  As for the Iraqi prisoners issue, it merits interest and a 
pause for consideration. Let us explain the scenario and the 
contradictory statements made by both North Yemen and Iraq. 
Initially, Sanaa and Baghdad categorically denied Iraq's 
participation in the war. When Iraqi prisoners, who were 
captured on the Shabwah-Hadhramaut military axis, appeared on 
television, Sanaa claimed that they were nurses who had been 
arrested at al-Hutah hospital in Lahij Governorate to be used as 
prisoners. As not even children or madmen would believe this 
story, Baghdad had to admit the presence of Iraqi military 
personnel contracted privately to join the Yemeni Army. So one 
of them bore witness to that. 
  [Shatarah] The northern Air Force's resumption of activities 
in the fighting has probably dashed your hopes that the early 
southern air strikes neutralized the northern Air Force. 
  [Tahir] Actually the northern Air Force's role has been 
limited, not completely paralyzed. Not only because of the 
crushing air strikes our Air Force launched against military 
airports in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz -- which destroyed a 
large number of aircraft as well as these airports, and thus 
paralyzed the effectiveness of the northern Air Force -- but 
also because the combat preparedness of the northern Air Force 
was very limited. 
  But it was the Iraqi and Jordanian aid and expertise which 
-- 
to some extent -- have restored the effectiveness of the 
northern Air Force recently. Nevertheless, all the air raids 
launched by the aircraft of the military regime in Sanaa have so 
far failed to inflict any damage on military targets, that is 
with the exception of the damage to the fuel tanks in the Aden 
refinery and the damage to a part of the electrothermal station, 
water tanks, and the homes of peaceful citizens. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shatarah] The northern leadership accused you of signing 
an arms deal with North Korea which includes tanks, artillery, 
and Sukhoy aircraft. What truth is there in this? 
  [Tahir] That accusation is absolutely baseless. And you can 
refer to the statement made by the official spokesman for the 
North Korean Foreign Ministry, who categorically denied that 
accusation. 
  All the accusations Sanaa is leveling at us are designed for 
the media and to divert attention from the military aid and arms 
deals it has obtained and is obtaining from a number of states, 
including Iraq and Iran. 
  [Shatarah] How did northern forces manage to reach the 
approaches of Aden? And do you expect the city to be captured 
by the northerners? 
  [Tahir] First, I repeat that the military regime in Sanaa 
prepared and planned for this war very early, while we were not 
prepared. Nor did we expect such an all-out war. 
  Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to 
occupy all the south. His forces attacked all border areas 
between the two parts [of Yemen]. He had thought that the 
situation would be settled within two or three days at the most. 
You remember the various statements he and his ministers made 
about settling the situation within 24, 48, or 72 hours. But 
the hours, days, and weeks have elapsed and nothing has happened. 
  It means that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces reached the 
approaches of Aden on after they suffered huge losses in both 
lives and equipment. But the military strategic aims of the war 
have failed completely. They have been broken on the rock of 
the steadfastness of our forces, which are defending bravely and 
steadfastly. The attack on Aden has failed, and northern forces 
have failed to advance as a result of our forces' steadfastness 
and death defiance. 
  In search of another shelter, the military regime in Sanaa 
is 
haphazardly and barbarously bombarding residential areas in Aden 
Governorates and vital economic installations by artillery, 
rockets, and aircraft. [passage omitted] 
  [Shatarah] You said in a local newspaper that there is 
internal treason. Can you specify it? And why did it happen? 
  [Tahir] It is very natural for infiltrations to happen here 
and there, as everyone considered themselves people of one 
state, and they dealt with one another innocently. Besides, 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has been pursuing the divide-and-rule 
principle. He has earnestly tried to create and fuel further 
splits and disputes in a bid to influence the internal front. 
  At any rate, those who joined the ranks of the military 
regime in Sanaa can be counted on the fingers of one hand and 
they have had no serious effect on the combat position of our 
forces, who have very bravely fought a brutal aggression in an 
all-out war which was planned and prepared for long ago. 
  [Shatarah] In your capacity as DRY defense minister, what 
are your priorities at the moment? 
  [Tahir] We are still engaged in the war imposed on us by the 
military regime in Sanaa. When victory has been achieved, God 
willing, we will begin our first tasks, first and foremost 
rebuilding and reorganizing our Armed Forces on modern 
scientific foundations so as to fulfill the requirements of the 
defense of our country and its national sovereignty. [passage 
omitted] 
  [Shatarah] Why is the south insisting on bringing 
international observers to supervise the cease-fire? 
  [Tahir] We have bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and his military regime with regard to promises, treaties, and 
agreements. 
  We signed more than 100 agreements with him, none of which 
has been implemented. The most recent is the Pledge and Accord 
Document signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 20 February. 
It was circumvented on the day it was signed. The regime in 
Sanaa suffers from a split personality with regard to words and 
actions. So we cannot rely on any agreement with 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, because he has lost all credibility and respects no 
pledge or agreement. 
  There is another reason: we are now an independent state and 
the war is between two states, and it is natural for us to refer 
our issue to the international organization. 
  [Shatarah] What measures will you take if Sanaa continues to 
attack vital installations in Aden or if it storms the city and 
rejects international initiatives? 
  [Tahir] Sanaa is still attacking vital economic 
installations in Aden and residential areas, just as it attacked 
villages and cities during its occupation. 
  We will not be able to stand with our hands tied if it 
continues its actions, which contravene the rules of war and 
human rights. As for storming Aden, it is impossible. And if 
Sanaa continues to rejects all international initiative, it is 
going to pay a very high price.

  [Text] A responsible source in the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen [DRY] has issued a statement to the ADEN NEWS AGENCY, in 
which he reported that the forces of the Sanaa rulers today 
continued their savage, iniquitous aggression against our people 
and Republic, the DRY. The source stressed that the aggression 
against our country and people, and its constant escalation, 
represented a naked violation of international legitimacy. The 
source also stressed that the Sanaa rulers were ignoring all 
appeals calling for an immediate cease-fire put out by worldwide 
well-wishers, who are anxious to see an end to bloodshed and the 
restoration of security and stability in Yemen, and in the 
region.

  [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the 
Presidential Council and secretary general of the Central 
Committee of the Yemeni Socialist Party, yesterday evening met a 
number of representatives of the tribes of al-Awatifah, and the 
al [clan] ba Wazir, al (Jayd), and al al-Haddad from Hadhramaut 
Governorate, who expressed their support for the establishment 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] as the latest victory 
for the national movement for building a modern state of law and 
order. [passage omitted] 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid hailed those present, and 
expressed 
his congratulations on the occasion of the Islamic New Year. 
[passage omitted] 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said that the declaration of the 
establishment of the Republic was made three weeks after the 
beginning of the war, and the northern insistence on effecting 
an occupation, so that citizens had to defend their Republic and 
its sovereignty. 
  He said: It was they who imposed the war, but they cannot 
impose surrender on us, because they lack the capacity to do so. 
He stressed the need to hail the resistance, reject the 
occupation, have faith in victory, defend the Republic, reject 
silence in the face of injustice, and defend the solidarity of 
the front, because we have right on our side. He stressed that 
the Yemeni Socialist Party did not envisage ruling on its own, 
because it believed in pluralism, with the participation of the 
various parties, all personalities in society, all individuals 
of goodwill, patriotic shaykhs, and all who love this Republic 
and struggle for its sake. The brother chairman of the 
Presidential Council said: We are now experiencing another 
stage imposed on us after 25 [number as heard] years since 
independence and now, once again, we are struggling for our 
independence. 
  We are struggling to stop the influence of this gang from 
penetrating these regions, because they are committing crimes, 
abominations, and pillage. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid lauded the 
heroic steadfastness of the citizens of Aden, the citizens in 
general, and the Armed Forces and security forces on the various 
battlefronts. He noted that the comprehensive recognition of 
the establishment of the Republic would accrue from this 
steadfastness and determination, because our forces spring from 
our people. [passage omitted] 
  He stressed that we Yemenis will not agree to be fourth 
class 
citizens, because we are fighters who created a democratic Yemen 
by making sacrifices. [passage omitted] 
  Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid called on the sons of Hadhramaut 
Governorate to step up their mobilization and strengthen their 
ranks, in order to fight this invasion. He noted that 
historically, in the 17th century, such resistance prevailed in 
Hadhramaut when invaders reached Dhofar during the reign of Imam 
al-Mutawakkil ala'Allah Isma'il. Then they withdrew from Dhofar 
to the sea, and were never able to return. He said: Today you 
will also drive out these invaders from Hadhramaut. We shall 
not permit ourselves to be governed by the al-Ahmar family and 
the fundamentalists. Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid said: We in our 
country know our history and our past, and we take pride in our 
history. We shall work together with all our brothers in the DRY 
to protect the Republic and its capital, Aden. We shall improve 
our situation and build ourselves up to be better than we were. 
We shall open our windows and our relations with all the people 
of the world, in the peninsula, and in the gulf. 
  The meeting was attended by Brother Awad 'Abdallah Murshidi, 
secretary of Hadhramaut Governorate.

  [Excerpt] The Council of Ministers held its periodic 
meeting this morning under the chairmanship of Acting Prime 
Minister Dr. Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar. The council discussed 
several issues listed on its en TMF1 including the supply issue. 
After reviewing ideas on how to deal with supply problems in a 
radical and successful way, the council decided to task the 
Economic Council with working out ways to deal with the issue in 
an accurate manner after assessing all [word indistinct]. 
  The Council of Ministers has recently noticed that a number 
of merchants are tampering with prices and exploiting the 
current situation in the country to tamper with citizens' food. 
Therefore, the government appeals to every one to shoulder his 
responsibility under the country's current circumstances imposed 
by the [word indistinct] homeland. 
  The government, at same time, warns against raising or 
tampering with prices, and considers such behavior an economic 
crime, the most serious of which is involvement in hoarding

and Trade, the Ministry of Interior, the public prosecutor, the 
security forces, and all competent authorities to take deterrent 
measures against tamperers. 
  The council also expects the brother citizens to cooperate

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman, last night received brother 
Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali. 
Talks dealt with several issues related to the fact-finding 
mission of the UN secretary general's envoy in implementation of 
Security Council Resolution 924. Brother Lakhdar Brahimi 
briefed the brother president on the results of his contacts 
within the framework of the mission entrusted to him by the UN 
secretary general. 
  The brother Presidential Council chairman emphasized anew 
our 
country's commitment to Security Council Resolution 924. He 
also noted the Yemeni Government's cease-fire initiatives since 
the resolution was adopted in order to give those who rebelled 
against legitimacy the chance to stop fighting and spare Yemeni 
blood. However, they foiled all these initiatives and did not 
respond to the calls made by brothers and friends to cease fire. 
They violated the cease-fire and did not commit themselves to 
the Security Council resolution with the aim of prolonging the 
conflict and internationalizing the Yemeni crisis. 
  He stressed our country's readiness for an open-minded 
dialogue to activate the entire joint military committee, which 
comprises the Yemeni side and a military team from the Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan, the Sultanate of Oman, and the U.S. and 
French military attaches to our country, to supervise adherence 
to the cease-fire. This dialogue can take place in any of the 
following Arab capitals: Damascus, Riyadh, Cairo, or Rabat, 
within the framework of commitment to the principles that 
maintain unity, democracy, constitutional legitimacy, and 
sovereignty and independence of the one Yemen. 
  He emphasized our country's appreciation for Lakhdar 
Brahimi's efforts and its desire to extend all possible support 
to render his mission successful in a manner that realizes 
security, stability, and peace for Yemen. 
  The meeting was attended by brother Muhammad Salim 
Basindwah, 
foreign minister, and 'Awni al-'Ani, UN Bureau representative in 
our country. 
  Following his meeting with brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, Presidential Council chairman, brother Lakhdar Brahimi 
replied to questions posed by [Yemeni] television by saying that 
he has been acquainted with the Yemeni views as well as the 
views of others in the region, and he will complete this task 
within the next two days in a way that will enable him to carry 
out his basic mission--the submission of a report to the UN 
secretary general. 
  He added: I think I held useful talks on two basic points at 
this stage. These are ceasing fire to stop the bloodshed and 
starting dialogue. 
  Brother Lakhdar Brahmi left Sanaa last night at the end of a 
short visit to our country.

  [Statement by "responsible source at the Defense Ministry of 
the Democratic Republic of Yemen" issued to the ADEN NEWS 
AGENCY; place and date not given] 

    [Excerpt] The ruling military regime in Sanaa has 
continued its blatant, adventurist defiance to the will of the 
international community, and all Arab and international efforts 
aimed at ending the shedding of Yemeni blood and the 
comprehensive war launched by the ruling military regime in 
Sanaa, over a month and half ago, in a desperate and [words 
indistinct] move in our country. Since this morning, the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa has continued its aggressive offensive 
attempts on all fronts, and in the course of its hostile 
operations this evening launched ground-to-ground missiles on 
the peaceful, calm city of Aden, intensifying its random 
shelling of residential areas. This evening the peaceful 
inhabitants of Aden were taken by surprise by three missiles 
fired toward the capital. Our air defenses intercepted them and 
shot one down, while the other two fell into the sea. One of 
the residential areas was hit by shellfire. A number of 
long-range artillery rockets did serious damage to the homes of 
innocent citizens. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 16 (AFP)--Northern shelling killed 
at least 18 people early Thursday in a suburb of the southern 
stronghold of Aden, hospital officials said. 
  The shelling also set fire to several homes in the Shaykh 
'Uthman suburb, just to the north of the city, and sent 
residents fleeing to safer areas. 
  The wounded were still being taken to the Al-Jumhuriyah 
hospital three hours after the dawn attack, officials at the 
hospital added. 
  Shaykh 'Uthman is about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the 
front lines to the north where southern and northern forces have 
been fighting artillery duels almost daily. 
  The war in Yemen broke out on May 5.

  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 16 (AFP)--Northern Yemeni 
warplanes dodged southern anti-aircraft fire to bomb Aden 
airport on Thursday, damaging hangers there, an AFP 
correspondent reported. 
  A huge plume of smoke rose above the airport in the southern 
stronghold as ambulances raced to the scene, following the air 
raid late morning. 
  There were no immediate details of casualties or the extent 
of the damage. 
  Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
besieging the key port city of Aden for three weeks, have 
targeted the airport several times to stop southern jet planes 
from taking off there. 
  Meanwhile, northern artillery units continued to fire shells 
sporadically at Aden following a dawn attack on the northern 
suburb of Shaykh 'Uthman which hospital officials said killed at 
least 18 civilians and wounded several more.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has approved a 
15-million shekel aid package to Jordan Valley settlements. The 
aid will be given as a loan for five years. Our correspondent 
Gil Litman reports that 3-million shekels of this sum will be 
transferred to the settlers of Na'ama, who chained themselves to 
the border fence earlier this week to protest the fact that the 
government is not aiding them. The demands of the Jordan Valley 
settlers have now been fully met. The head of the Jordan Valley 
Regional Council thanked the prime minister, adding this aid 
proves that Rabin supports the strengthening the Jordan Valley 
settlements.

Ben] 
  [Excerpts] "Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO 
chairman Yasir 'Arafat agreed in their meeting in Bucharest two 
weeks before the Cairo agreement was signed that 'Arafat would 
visit Temple Mount," Palestinian sources said yesterday. 
  According to these sources, the agreement was preceded by 
exhausting negotiations in which 'Arafat repeatedly raised his 
request to visit Jerusalem escorted by armed Palestinian 
policemen. The Israelis initially refused his request, but 
finally agreed to allow 'Arafat to hold a ceremonial visit to 
Temple Mount, perhaps even accompanied by flag-bearing 
Palestinian policemen. 
  Peres stated yesterday that Israel had not received a 
request 
from 'Arafat to visit Jerusalem. "We do not rush to give 
answers to unasked questions," said Peres, who is currently 
visiting Ukraine. Sources in his entourage noted that to the 
best of their knowledge the reports about an agreement reached 
between Peres and 'Arafat during their meeting in Bucharest 
concerning the PLO chairman visiting Jerusalem escorted by 
flag-bearing Palestinian policemen are not true. [passage 
omitted] 
  Security sources noted yesterday that Jibril al-Rujub, head 
of the Palestinian secret service in the territories whose 
activities have been confined to the Jericho area, visited East 
Jerusalem and the Old City on several occasions over the past 
few weeks. The sources expressed their concern about this 
occurrence, noting that these visits might cause security 
damage. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Israel will not be able to prevent murderers of 
Jews from serving in the Palestinian police. This emerges from 
a letter sent by the Information Department of the Prime 
Minister's Office which was obtained by our political 
correspondent Gadi Sukenik. A resident of the settlement of 
Teqoa' in the territories wrote a letter to the prime minister 
asking whether the murderers of Jews, including the man who 
murdered his neighbor and was released, will be allowed to serve 
in the Palestinian police, or will Israel prevent this. 
  The letter of reply from the Prime Minister's Office says, 
among other things, that the Israeli Government will continue 
fighting terrorism and hunt down those sabotaging peace, but 
will not be able to determine who can serve in the Palestinian 
police.

  [Text] Just about one month since the withdrawal from Gaza 
and Jericho, Israel's coordinator in the territories described 
the transition as smooth, but said the problem for the 
Palestinians remains that of lack of funds. Major General Dani 
Rothschild, in a briefing to reporters, said the Palestinian 
Authority needs startup funds for salaries and operating costs. 
In a meeting in Paris last week, donor countries gave $42 
million for operating costs. But the Palestinian budget is 
three to four time that of what had been under Israeli 
administration. Rothschild said the increase comes from having 
to finance the police force. Previously security needs had been 
supplied mostly by the Israel Army. Those costs came from a 
separate budget. Rothschild also said Israel is continuing to 
provide basic services, including electricity, water, and 
telephones to the Palestinians in the autonomous areas, but the 
Palestinians will recompense Israel when they can. 
  [Begin Rothschild recording] We didn't leave a paradise 
there. With a population as big as in Gaza, with a poor 
infrastructure, with lack of jobs, and with a very high birth 
rate, it's almost impossible to create a paradise. Having said 
that, we ensured that everyone who needs the basic service will 
get it. Now, here and there we hear about people who didn't get 
the services, and we are dealing every day with exceptions, but 
at the end of the day those are exceptions, because the Israeli 
Government has the responsibility to finance all those services 
which I just mentioned until the Palestinian Authority will have 
sufficient resources to finance itself. The answer is no, the 
Israeli Government will not finance those services, but having 
said that, the Israeli Government will ensure that those 
services are going to be given to the Palestinian Authority and 
in the meantime Israel will pay for it, and in the future Israel 
and the Palestinian Authority, in a joint economic committee 
which was decided upon in Paris, will sit and will arrange all 
those bills, so eventually the Palestinian Authority will have 
to pay. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Dudi Goldman] </F>
  [Text] Several Israeli institutions recently purchased 
sophisticated American computers with a capacity equivalent to 
that of a supercomputer, which the U.S. Defense Department has 
banned from being exported to Israel. 
  The United States restricts exports of fast supercomputers 
to 
many countries, especially those who have not signed the Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty. But a new development by the U.S. firm 
Mips [as transliterated] and the Japanese firm Toshiba enhances 
the performance of medium-size computers, which can be exported 
to Israel, to the level of a very fast supercomputer, which 
cannot be exported to Israel. 
  The new development provides the computer with a processing 
capacity of 300 million instructions per second. In fact, it is 
a flexible computer which can operate on one array of chips, 
which does not require a special export license, but to which an 
additional array of chips can be added. A computer with three 
arrays of chips requires a special license since it attains the 
processing power of a supercomputer. In principle, even five 
such arrays of chips can be added to the computer.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yo'el Bin-Nun: "In The Old Middle East"] </F>
  [Text] There is nothing new in the Middle East. They say 
that after Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir died, his successor Anwar 
al-Sadat was riding the presidential limousine. When he arrived 
at a junction in the center of Cairo, the driver asked: Where 
should we turn here? Where did the late president use to turn? 
al-Sadat asked. The driver said: Left, of course! (the 
Nasirist socialism). Well, then, al-Sadat said, signal to the 
left, but turn right. 
  Israel has become part of the Middle East thanks to the two 
governments of the late Menahem Begin who signed the Camp David 
agreements. Agreements that included an autonomy for the 
Palestinians, an Israeli withdrawal, and a strong Palestinian 
police force. At the time, everyone realized this was merely a 
fig leaf for Egypt allowing it to sign a separate agreement with 
Israel. Everyone also understood that Begin gave up on the 
entire Sinai to save Judaea and Samaria. 
  With one hand, Ari'el Sharon promoted the construction of 
strongholds in the Yamit Strip but, in a careless phone call, 
gave Begin his approval for the full withdrawal from the entire 
Sinai, and destroyed Yamit to the ground himself. 
  Even the faithful of Eretz Yisra'el were part of the Middle 
East then. The struggle conducted over the rooftops of Yamit 
was, in fact, not over Yamit. It was an attempt to deter 
possible negotiations over the fate of Judaea and Samaria. 
  We can say today that the struggle fulfilled its purpose 
perfectly. When asked how come there was no bitter struggle 
over Jericho, we answer that this struggle was conducted in 
Yamit, and the result of that struggle is the fact that in the 
current agreement, signed by a leftist government, the 
settlements remain in place and the Palestinians were forced to 
agree. 
  Now the struggle over Judaea and Samaria, and Jerusalem 
begins; or to be more precise: the struggle over Judaea and 
Samaria for Jerusalem, and over Jerusalem as the heart of Judaea 
and Samaria. The whole truth is not always said in the Middle 
East. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres is now leading us to new 
levels in the Middle East. Last week he explained that he 
denied the letter on Jerusalem because: A. it was not released 
in Cairo; B. it was not sent to 'Arafat; C. it was not 
considered a commitment in the negotiations. 
  Here, Peres picked a noble example. If someone asked 
Ben-Gurion whether he met someone at 5 o'clock when the meeting 
was at 6, he would simply say no. No one asked him about a 6 
o'clock meeting, therefore he did not answer. Peres calls this 
"an absolute truth." 
  True, the open agreements contain clauses far graver than 
this letter, and its exposure allows us to, perhaps, close some 
of the loopholes regarding Jerusalem. But, what about the norms 
of "our ministers'" conduct? 
  Now I understand what the foreign minister meant when he 
said 
that the PLO has not been involved in terror acts since the Oslo 
agreement was signed. He made the remark when objective sources 
reported that 35 acts of terror were perpetrated by Fatah groups 
between the signing of the Oslo agreement and the Cairo 
agreement. Peres was simply referring to PLO-Tunis diplomats who 
were busy with the negotiations. 
  The time has come to examine Peres' economic vision for the 
Middle East. Naturally, he was not misleading us when he spoke 
of flourishing growth if the agreements succeed. He used the 
"absolute truth" method. The Palestinians will flourish and 
experience growth, Israel is supposed to shrink. 
  When Peres stood on the Knesset podium and spoke about the 
Israeli agriculture, about making the desserts blossom and 
glorifying Zionism, he knew he was delivering an eulogy. He 
knew that Palestinian farming is about to inherit Israeli 
farming; that every Palestinian well drilled in the Janin area 
will dry up a Zionist well in the Yizre'el Valley; that there is 
not enough water for two farming systems that make the desert 
flourish. He also knew that the prices of the Palestinian 
produce will eliminate the Israeli agriculture. 
  How do I know that he knew? Because, shortly after the Oslo 
agreement was signed, I obtained the forecasts of "Israel Toward 
the Year 2025," prepared by professional teams associated with 
the foreign minister. 
  They clearly forecasted that Israeli agriculture, along with 
other economic branches that require plenty of manual labor, 
will collapse. They forecast that Israel will be crowded, with 
people living in high-rises, and that housing prices will soar 
seriously. They realized that the growth we have been 
experiencing since the Six-Days War will be replaced by a 
Palestinian growth. 
  They also knew that the only chance the Israeli economy has 
to flourish depends on the level of our incorporation in "joint 
projects" with the Palestinians. This is precisely why 
Abu-Hulala [name as published], in charge of Palestinian 
development, has announced that Israeli entrepreneurs will not 
be incorporated in any of the projects. 
  Palestinians flourishing at our expense may not be critical, 
but this will not convince the Tel Aviv stock exchange. There, 
they have begun to understand this is the "absolute truth." 
  Does this have to happen? No! Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
can still come to his senses and retaliate for the dozens of 
Palestinian violations of the agreements: A. He can send the 
Palestinian national institutions to Jericho, with all due 
respect. B. He can renew construction, if only in the Israeli 
settlement strip in the western Samaria and Binyamin Districts, 
where there is a clear Jewish majority even today. 
  In doing so, Rabin will be securing Israeli control over the 
mountain aquifer, the Dan District water reservoir. He will 
prevent the elimination of the Israeli agriculture in the Sharon 
region, and will ease the pressure and distress in housing 
construction. 
  By resuming construction work in the greater Dan District, 
we 
could signal a direction for Israel to thrive, before any 
Palestinian growth. The Palestinians will gain, but not at our 
expense. 
  It does not matter whether this is the third or the fourth 
path. It is certain that the people will back it, no matter who 
leads it.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Jun (INA) -- Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
'Aziz received PRC Assistant Foreign Minister Wang Changyi and 
the delegation accompanying him today. 
  During the meeting, the deputy prime minister gave a 
detailed 
explanation on the development of the relationship between Iraq 
and the UN Security Council, and Iraq's intensive efforts to end 
the unjust embargo that was imposed on it even after it has 
implemented the obligations that were asked of it. 'Aziz said 
that now that Iraq has fulfilled its obligations, the UN 
Security Council should also fulfill its obligations toward 
Iraq. Tariq 'Aziz praised the PRC's positive role in this 
respect. 
  Tariq 'Aziz stressed the need for the PRC, as a UN Security 
Council permanent member, to exercise an effective role by

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Milorad Unkovic, federal 
minister for foreign economic relations, arrived in Baghdad this 
morning. He is heading a Yugoslav delegation during its 
official visit to Iraq at the invitation of the Iraqi 
Government. In the course of his visit, scheduled to end on 
Monday, Unkovic will meet a number of high-ranking Iraqi 
officials. 
  He is expected to discuss bilateral relations and 
particularly economic problems and outstanding debts owed to 
Yugoslav companies which have for years been involved in 
construction projects. The projects and the payments for them 
were suspended after Iraqi troops entered Kuwait in August 1991.

  [Text] Baghdad, 15 Jun (INA)--Dr. Hans Sterchen has 
emphasized that the Arabs and other parties in the region are 
responsible for lifting the siege imposed on Iraq without 
waiting for a resolution by the United Nations and Washington. 
  In an interview published in ALIF BA' magazine, published 
today, Sterchen, who is the chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee at the German Parliament, said the free German 
parliamentarians want to see the siege on Iraqi children lifted 
and to assist sick Iraqis by providing them with necessary 
medicines that are in short supply in Iraq due to the 
continuation of the siege. 
  The German parliamentarian criticized the attempts by some 
parties, inside and outside the region, to interfere in Iraq's 
international affairs. He stressed that Iraq should play its 
role in the region's security and stability. 
  He referred to the credibility of the Iraqi steps that 
contribute to the setting up a new order in the Arab arena that 
depends on coexistence and stability based on the rule of law in 
the internal and foreign sectors. He said he was impressed by 
the democratic experiment and pluralism that was approved by the 
Iraqi National Assembly. 
  Sterchen urged those concerned with humanitarian activities 
to directly and actively contribute to, and assume their 
international role in ending the suffering of Iraq. He 
denounced the campaign against his noble humanitarian efforts to 
assist Iraq's children and other social sectors. 
  Concluding his statement, Dr. Sterchen, the free German 
parliamentarian, said: I will concentrate my efforts with the 
United Nations to provide more assistance to Iraq, and I will do 
all I can with the Humanitarian Assistance Committee and the 
Foreign Relations Committee to use the frozen Iraqi funds in 
Germany to extend humanitarian and food assistance to the Iraqi 
people.

food for the citizens at symbolic prices amounts to 99.7 percent

the ration card. 
  The minister added: The official price of the foodstuffs 
that are given to every individual under the ration card is 
3.085 dinars, while their market price is 1,015 dinars. Thus 
the state pays the difference of 1,012 dinars for every 
individual. The official price of milk and the other materials 
such as soaps and washing powders given to children below one 
year is 3.400 dinars, while the market price is 700 dinars. 
Thus, the state pays a difference in price of 697 dinars.

  [Text] The Ministry of Industry and Minerals has emphasized 
that its technical and engineering cadres specialized in the 
electrical sector are doing their best to ensure that electrical 
current reaches all parts of the country. 
  Subhi Nijm al-'Ani, director general of the Electricity 
Department said that ensuring constant electrical current 
depends on citizens' cooperation with the technical organs 
through rationing consumption of electrical power and avoiding 
unnecessary consumption or unjustified extravagance. 
  He said such intentional extravagance in electricity 
consumption includes switching on a large number of lights in 
gardens and houses, which wastes a great deal of energy and 
encroaches on the rights of others. 
  He said the best type of light for rationing electricity is 
the neon light because it consumes less energy and gives more 
light.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Mua'yyad 'Abd-al-Zahrah: "The Three </F>
Islands and These Iranian Statements"] 
  [Text] For Iran to refuse returning the occupied islands to 
Arab sovereignty and to insist on carving up, confiscating, and 
Persianizing these islands; and in fact escalating its 
aggressive threats every time their subject is brought up here 
or there is not new. That regime is accustomed to making such 
threats through its officials from time to time, which clearly 
reveals Iran's greed and ambitions for expansion and occupation. 
This tendency has always characterized its policy with the 
neighboring countries. 
  Although the Iranian regime has tried several times to show 
moderation, flexibility, and a desire to establish relations of 
good neighborliness with the countries of the region, those 
attempts were, at best, no more than a bridge to cross, expand, 
and interfere in the internal affairs of those countries and to 
fulfill its sickening dreams and delusions to dominate the 
region and its affairs. 
  Perhaps Rafsanjani's recent statements to maintain the 
occupation of Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa Islands and 
his declaration that any attempt to regain those islands will 
have to be through a sea of blood, truly express the Iranian 
regime's arrogant mentality and policy of belligerency and 
piracy. But the responsibility for this Iranian belligerency 
and piracy is born by the UAE and most of the other Gulf states 
for appeasing that regime and keeping silent about its 
interferences and terrorist acts. That unprincipled, 
compromising has contributed to Iranian expansionism and 
encouraged the Tehran regime to maintain its occupation of the 
three islands. 
  By returning to the language of threats anew at a time when 
Tehran and other Iranian cities are witnessing protests, 
strikes, resistance operations, and deteriorating social, 
economic, and political conditions, the Iranian regime is trying 
to divert the Iranian people's attention from their worsening 
internal conditions. This is an old game which Iran also used 
during its aggression against Iraq. It is still playing this 
game in order to prolong the life of its crippled regime. By 
renewing its impudent threats and affirming its adherence to the 
tendencies of aggression and expansion and the same old dreams, 
the Iranian regime wants to hint that it can instill itself and 
its existence on the region. Yet, the reality confirms that 
regime's hollow claims, bankruptcy, and imminent collapse.

<F P=106> [Report by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish: "In Message From His </F>
Prison to Zeroual, Belhadj Says: Salvation Front Willing To 
Engage in Dialogue Openly, Not Behind Scenes"] 
  [Excerpt] Paris -- Cheikh Ali Belhadj has denied that the 
Algerian [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] pledged to stop the 
violence following the release of its leadership members Ali 
Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham. He stressed that he told 
Algerian President Liamine Zeroual when Zeroual was defense 
minister that what is happening is not terrorism, but the 
people's right to fight the usurpers of power in accordance with 
the Shari'ah and the law. This came in a message Belhadj sent to 
President Zeroual from prison on 7 April, which was distributed 
yesterday evening by the FIS Executive Committee abroad. 
  In the message Belhadj replies to a recent statement by the 
presidency, which says that FIS leaders pledged to stop violence 
and on that basis Djeddi and Boukhamkham were released, but they 
have not fulfilled their pledge. 
  In his statement Belhadj criticized the presidency's 
statement, describing it as "a lie and a slander." He said: 
"That false statement weakens the president's chances of 
solving the political problem, thus complicating, rather than 
solving it. What makes things even worse is that there have 
been several observations since his appointment as president 
which deserve to be announced. They include the duality in the 
rhetoric and the positions, and the hesitation, as though the 
real field solution is the security solution." 
  Belhadj attributes the duality in the regime's rhetoric to 
three points: 
  1. The predominance and influence of the clique of evil. 
  2. Fear of the influence of the ideological minorities. 
  3. Enjoyment of power, on the basis that the president's 
seat changes the mentality of those who sit there. 
  Belhadj urged President Zeroual to allow the FIS to reply to 
the presidency's statement through television and radio. He 
added: "We said that we are willing to discuss the problem 
afflicting Algeria not behind the scenes, but openly on 
television." 
  The message reflects the impasse the political dialogue has 
reached in Algeria. The delay in distributing the message 
reflects the strict control imposed on imprisoned FIS leaders 
and the difficulty of contacting them. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Algerian-U.S.-French Contacts To </F>
Find Coalition Formula Including Salvation Front"] 
  [Text] Algiers -- AL-HAYAH has learned that contacts at 
the highest level are under way between the Algerian 
authorities, the Islamists, the Americans, and the French to 
find a coalition formula acceptable to the various parties 
before the end of summer. 
  Western diplomatic sources have told AL-HAYAH that the 
Americans believe that the "lost time" was not in the interests 
of the ruling authorities in Algeria and that a solution could 
only be found through dialogue and national reconciliation. 
  Observers expect surprises in the Army if the dialogue fails 
or if the Algerian authorities do not urgently seek a solution 
within the next three months. They believe that the French, 
after President Bill Clinton's visit to Paris, are now convinced 
of the need to help in paving the way for a solution "that would 
be acceptable to the Islamists and that would be seen by 
Washington as an alternative to what happened in Iran." 
  Sources close to the leadership of the Islamic Salvation 
Front [FIS] say that it is not unlikely "that a secret agreement 
has been reached between some FIS leaderships and the U.S. 
Administration on a concept for the transitional period, or what 
the Americans call a national coalition government." 
  The sources speak of "U.S. guarantees given to these 
leaderships of a shift from military rule to civilian rule 
without bloodshed, with the U.S. interests in Algeria 
safeguarded." 
  In addition to that agreement, some European states and the 
United States have been holding intensive contacts with Hocine 
Ait-Ahmed, leader of the Socialist Forces Front, who has visited 
Washington and discussed with the U.S. Administration issues of 
human rights, revival of democracy in Algeria, and how the three 
major forces could contribute to that along with some 
independent forces. 
  Meanwhile, Abdelhamid Mehri, secretary general of the 
National Liberation Front [FLN], wrote the editorial of the 
first edition of YOUMIYAT EL HEWAR ["dialogue diary"] saying 
that "YOUMIYAT EL HEWAR is issued at this particular time under 
the pressure of political need." He reaffirmed the FLN's 
insistence on dialogue as the solution to the crisis. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, some patriotic figures 
have 
recently submitted a proposal to President Liamine Zeroual 
calling for the release of the FIS leaders on the occasion of 
the 32d anniversary of national independence which falls on 5 
July. 
  Observers believe that the only losers from the "coalition 
formula" and the participation of the three fronts [FLN, FIS, 
and the Socialist Forces Front] would be the horses France has 
been backing since the suspension of the election process to 
this day, thinking that they would be the alternative to the FLN 
and FIS. These horses are the secular group and the Francophiles 
led by Saeed Saadi. 
  Reliable sources have told AL-HAYAH that the investigations 
regarding the Israeli arms found in the possession of Saadi's 
supporters did not rule out the possibility of a link between 
him and some of the armed groups which recently assassinated 
figures loyal to the Islamic Groups and the Islamic trend, 
especially the lawyers. 
  In another development, sources close to the Algerian 
Interior Ministry say that a committee has been formed to draft 
"legislation" under which the publication of any reports on 
terrorism would be prohibited and papers and journalists doing 
so would be prosecuted. 
  AL-HAYAH has learned that at dawn yesterday the "special 
rapid deployment forces" stormed the home of Algerian writer 
Khalid Omar Kekah, editor of the weekly EL CHOROUK EL ARABI 
["Arab Dawn"], the biggest publication in Algeria with a 
circulation of 350,000, which also has a twin weekly publication 
called EL CHOROUK EL THAKAFI ["Cultural Dawn"].

  [Text] Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa left Tunis this morning 
for Malta on a three-day official visit after participating in 
the African summit meetings. In a predeparture statement, he 
said that President Mubarak's participation in the African 
summit and his inaugural speech played an extremely important 
role in advancing efforts toward resolving African problems. 
These efforts were in completion of Egypt's tasks during its 
chairmanship of the OAU. He said that Egypt presented proposals 
and held consultations that were welcomed and appreciated by all 
delegations. They contributed significantly towards resolving 
problems discussed during the summit, particularly the issues of 
development and debts. 
  Musa said that his visit to Malta is within the framework of 
cooperation among the Mediterranean countries and preparation 
for a meeting among a number of those countries' foreign 
ministers to study the situation in the region and coordinate 
policies. He noted he will also discuss ways of bolstering ties 
between Egypt and Malta in all fields.

  [Text] Cairo, 15 Jun (MENA)--The Central Cairo Prosecution 
Office will issue a decision tomorrow morning, Thursday, 
concerning the continued detention of 33 lawyers, including two 
members of the Bar Association's board. The lawyers are held in 
custody in connection with investigations concerning the 
demonstration that took place at the Bar Association on 17 May. 
In another development, Higher State Security Public Attorney 
'Abd-al-Sami' Sharaf today decided to remand Ahmad Nasir, a 
former member of the Bar Association's board, and four other 
lawyers for 15 days pending investigations. The attorney 
accused the defendants of distributing leaflets hostile to the 
regime and urging lawyers to demonstrate and disturb public 
order. The lawyers were arrested after distributing leaflets at 
South Cairo court during the questioning by Central Cairo 
Prosecution investigators of some of the lawyers detained in 
connection with the demonstration at the Bar Association on 17 
May. 
  [Paris AFP in English at 1900 GMT on 15 June in a 
Cairo-datelined item adds the following: 
  ["Egyptian security services have arrested five lawyers just 
hours after the prosecutor's office refused to release 33 others 
being held on public order charges, a human rights body said 
Wednesday. 
  ["The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights said the five 
were arrested overnight and condemned the measure, saying it 
could only aggravate the tension between the government and the 
bar association. 
  ["Earlier the prosecutor retained in custody 33 lawyers 
arrested during a rally organised by the bar association to 
protest the death in custody of colleague 'Abd-al-Harith Madani, 
a legal source said. 
  ["Most of the 38 now being held belong to the outlawed but 
tolerated Moslem Brotherhood. 
  ["The human rights group said the lawyers had been accused 
of 
"disturbing public order, inciting demonstrations and holding 
leaflets they intended to distribute. 
  ["In a statement it condemned the fact that such acts were 
banned although they "form part of the right to non-violent 
expression. 
  ["The group also called on the government to release its 
findings into Madani's death. Lawyers have charged Madani was 
tortured to death in April, but the prosecutor's office has said 
he suffered an asthma attack."]

  [Text] Tehran, June 15, IRNA -- Deputy foreign minister for 
Euro-American affairs Mahmud Va'ezi here Wednesday brushed aside 
the view that there was rivalry between Iran and Turkey in the 
region. 
  Va'ezi, who was speaking to Turkish Foreign Ministry 
Director 
General for Caucasus and Balkans affairs, (Omer Ersun), said 
Tehran has always welcomed cooperation with Ankara in the 
Caucasus and Central Asia. 
  He saw adoption of comprehensive measures and cooperation 
among all regional countries as key factors for peace and 
regretted that efforts made so far to peacefully settle crises 
have proved futile. 
  Va'ezi welcomed consultations between Iranian and Turkish 
officials on issues concerning the Cacasus and Central Asia and 
said Tehran and Ankara could help restore peace and stability in 
the region especially in the Caucasus in view of their common 
stands. He warned that continuation of crisis in the region 
would lead to escalation of tension, and underscored joint 
efforts by regional states to end the ongoing crisis. 
  (Ersun) in return referred to "bright" prospects of 
Tehran-Ankara political cooperation, and hoped that it would 
help restore peace and stability in the region.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Besharati's Visit to Turkey"] </F>
  [Text] Interior Minister 'Ali Besharati-Jahromi is in 
Ankara on a three-day official visit. His objective is to hold 
talks on regional and international developments and political 
and security matters between Iran and Turkey. In a statement 
after his meeting with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, 'Ali 
Besharati-Jahromi recalled the favorable relations between the 
two countries and stressed that neither a security nor a 
political problem exists between Iran and Turkey. He also 
described the cooperation between the two countries on the 
struggle against terrorism as a positive outcome of the 
uninterrupted contacts between the officials in Tehran and 
Ankara and outlined Iran's uneasiness over the activities of 
certain anti-Iran elements in Turkey. 
  The situation in northern Iraq and the bearing it has on 
security in the region was a focus of the talks 'Ali 
Besharati-Jahromi had with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin. 
  Iran and Turkey have established strong relations because of 
their historic, religious, and cultural ties as two neighboring 
countries. The cooperation between the two countries within the 
framework of the Economic Cooperation Organization is a factor 
that enhances their relations. Meanwhile, the meetings of the 
Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee in Tehran and Ankara 
constitute one of the results of the important agreements the 
two countries have reached to promote their cooperation on 
security matters. Iran's approach is based on the principle of 
non-interference in the internal affairs of foreign countries. 
  'Ali Besharati-Jahromi stressed that the friendly relations 
between Iran and Turkey are motivated by the concept of 
good-neighborly relations and noted that Turkey's enemies have 
no place in Iran. He also stressed that Tehran is well aware of 
Turkey's problems and regards Turkey's foes as its own enemies. 
  The Iranian and Turkish officials had discussed the question 
of peace and security on the common border between Iran and 
Turkey and the developments in northern Iraq several times in 
the past. Tehran and Ankara support the maintenance of Iraq's 
territorial integrity. In view of that, the two sides call for 
an urgent solution to the problems in northern Iraq. The 
continuation of the clashes will further complicate the 
situation and create instability in that region. A tripartite 
meeting will be held on the matter in Damascus between Iran, 
Turkey, and Syria. The outcome of the assessment of the 
developments in Iraq will be very important. 
  Meanwhile, matters concerning relations between Iran and 
Turkey will be discussed once again when President Suleyman 
Demirel visits Tehran in July. The two countries are expected 
to draw up an effective plan to strengthen their bilateral 
cooperation in the near future.

  [Text] 'Ali Mohammad Besharati, the interior minister of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, heading a high-ranking delegation, 
arrived in Ankara yesterday for a two-day official visit. Mr. 
Besharati announced the agenda of the talks as being the 
expansion of security, military, political, and parliamentary 
cooperation between the two countries. 
  The interior minister's visit to Turkey is within the 
framework of the visits that have taken place during the recent 
decade of ties between the two countries. The heads of the two 
countries' executive authorities exchange visits to Tehran and 
Ankara regularly in order to study the possibilities for 
expanding political and economic relations. The last such visit 
was First Vice President Hasan Habibi's trip to Ankara in 
December of 1993, and President Suleyman Demirel is to visit 
Tehran in the near future. 
  Iran and Turkey are the founding members of the Economic 
Cooperation Organization, ECO, and are regarded as active 
members of the Islamic Conference Organization vis-a-vis the 
Bosnia-Herzegovina issue. Tehran and Ankara cooperate in 
technical, economic, and transportation fields as well as on 
regional issues. The volume of trade between the two countries 
was about $600 million last year, and the amount of goods 
transported from Turkish ports to Iran reached a figure of 
200,000 tonnes. At the same time, security and military 
cooperation to establish order and tranquility along the borders 
is considered one of the important aspects of the two countries' 
relations. 
  Iran and Turkey share a common border of 511 km. Two years 
ago, a joint security committee was set up to prevent 
infiltration of elements that threaten the two countries' 
security. On the basis of the agreements reached, the two 
countries will not permit any illegal activity on their 
territory that threatens the other country's security. At 
present, the interior ministers of Iran and Turkey; officials of 
the security cooperation committee; the border provinces' 
governors general; and the governors, military, and security 
officers stationed along the two countries' borders are in 
direct contact. These initiatives on the whole and the existing 
mutual goodwill is assisting the two countries in their war 
against terrorism and drug trafficking. It is hoped that in the 
wake of Mr. Besharati's visit to Ankara, further steps will be 
taken to continue and expand cooperation.

  [Text] Tehran, June 15 (AFP) -- A visit by an Iranian 
delegation to Iraq, which was due to take place on June 11, has 
been indefinitely postponed, a reliable source said Wednesday. 
  The source did not say which side had postponed the visit or 
why it had been delayed, but added that it was not caused by 
political problems but by timetabling difficulties. 
  The delegation had been expected in Baghdad on Saturday to 
prepare a visit in July by 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who would be the 
first Iranian top official to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf war. 
  The sources said the delegation was to leave for Iraq "in 
the 
near future," but did not give a specific date. 
  The decision to postpone the visit appears to have been 
taken 
at the last minutes as Velayati confirmed his visit to Iraq last 
Friday and the daily Kayhan International said Sunday that the 
delegation had already left for Baghdad. 
  The last visit by an Iraqi delegation to Iran was also 
postponed from November to February, following a "decision by 
Baghdad." 
  Last October, Iran and Iraq resumed talks, broken after the 
Gulf war, to normalise ties, five years after the end of 
1980-1988 war. 
  However, little headway has been made as Tehran and Baghdad 
are sharply divided over a number of issues, mainly the fate of 
thousands of prisoners of war from both countries. 
  Velayati, who met his Iraqi counterpart Sa'id al-Sahhaf on 
the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement conference in Cairo 
earlier this month, has warned that "more time is needed to 
restore confidence." 
  President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani has for his part 
urged caution over any chances of success from Velayati's visit. 
  "There are too many subjects to be discussed," he said last 
week. "If the results of negotiations are acceptable, they could 
open way towards improving ties."

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Officials of the Islamic Republic have repeatedly 
commented on the insecurity of the regime and have said that 
security should continue to be a major issue. Where does the 
regime's concern come from and what plans are officials 
preparing to establish security? 
  Obviously the Islamic Republic is under intense pressure 
both 
at home and abroad. At home the people's dissatisfaction with 
the regime is increasing more each day. The outcome of the 
policy for economic adjustment and some minimal economic steps 
have only led to more bottlenecks in the lives and livelihood of 
millions of Iranians. The policy of economic adjustment that 
the regime has adopted has led to the dismissal and unemployment 
of tens of thousands of civil servants, workers, and teachers 
and more and more people are without jobs in our country. Thus, 
the lives of the poor and the destitute are becoming more 
difficult each day. 
  At a time when inflation is soaring, undoubtedly the 
disgruntled people will not sit idle but will demand work, 
bread, health and hygiene, education, and other needs. This is 
one of the main roots of the insecurity that the regime speaks 
of. But the regime, which is unable to ensure either the 
people's livelihood or work, is preparing to fill the empty 
stomachs and protesting throats of these people with [word 
indistinct]. 
  Meanwhile, the regime's failure to confront the so-called 
cultural onslaught by the West is yet another issue that has 
increased its concern and feeling of insecurity. However, the 
regime's officials have not only not learned a lesson from their 
defeats but they want to continue their blind opposition to the 
civilized world and its achievements. 
  The rulers of Qom and Tehran have also realized that the 
preservation and safeguarding of an ideological regime like that 
of the Islamic Republic cannot be possible without crushing 
freedom and democracy, violating human rights, and interfering 
in the people's private lives. They also know that the people 
oppose this policy of the regime and will fight it. 
  The clerical regime, which is politically, culturally, and 
philosophically unable to satisfy the people, will undoubtedly 
resort to suppression, the gallows, torture, and arrests to 
advance its policies and to crush the people's freedom-seeking 
ideas. Thus, the regime's inability to meet the people's daily 
needs, the deepening of the economic crisis, the fall of 
cultural policy into an impasse, the isolation on an 
international level, and the pressures of public opinion have 
all helped to instill these feelings of concern and insecurity. 
Because of all these elements, the regime has deployed all of 
the country's potential to ensure its security and to preserve 
itself. 
  The most important part of this security plan is the 
centralization of the suppressive organs, the strengthening of 
the (?ties) among them, and the elevation of the combat ability 
of its forces. It is not without reason that the regime has 
assigned Besharati the responsibility of heading the Islamic 
Republic's [Supreme National] Security Council in addition to 
his position as interior minister. Also, the organizing of its 
suppressive forces and of its war machinery is another part of 
the regime's security plan. The regime now intends to further 
organize its suppressive forces and to increase their strength 
in crushing operations. 
  Seyfollahi, commander of the Islamic Republic's 
law-enforcement forces, says that he needs 300,000 fresh forces 
to remove the existing problems. In addition, among the 
regime's other steps are the return to the scene of the 
Resistance Basij and the formation of another body known as 
executive officers for judicial affairs to help in the 
implementation of the policy of doing good and shunning evil in 
a bid to safeguard the security of the Islamic Republic. 
  In addition to all these, the regime has also issued orders 
on the formation of a rapid deployment force to further crush 
Kordestan. Efforts to weaken the opposition's activities also 
form another part of the regime's policy. The signing of joint 
accords with Turkey, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to plot against 
the Kordestan movement and the Baluchi combatants is the most 
convincing proof of this. 
  In addition to all of this, the Islamic Republic is also 
trying to limit the sphere of activities of the [Iranian] 
opposition in Europe. To achieve this, it inflicts pressures on 
it on the one hand and grants concessions to it on the other. 
[sentence as heard] Clearly, the assassination of regime 
opponents is the most outstanding aspect of the regime's 
security policy abroad. 
  In short, the regime continues to pursue the policy of 
suppression and violence to safeguard its security. But the 
question is: Can this policy have a favorable outcome for the 
regime? We think not because the methods that the Islamic 
Republic has adopted and tested throughout its existence have 
all been futile and have not borne any favorable results. Now 
that the regime is facing an impasse because of its clerical 
policies, thoughts, and culture the only thing that it can use 
is suppression and violence. Since it does not know any other 
language but that of suppression and arms, naturally we should 
expect it to speak in this language. However, sooner or later it 
will be proven that the regime's suppressive machinery will not 
always be useful vis-a-vis the people's determination and 
uprisings and that finally it will have to kneel down in front 
of the people and of justice.

  [Text] Tax relief for 60 percent of the country's economic 
activities will be cancelled in the second five-year economic 
development plan. 
  According to Economics and Finance Minister Morteza 
Mohammad-Khan the above mentioned activities currently include 
water, electricity, gas, communications, oil, and other sectors 
currently tax exempt. All such tax exemptions are to be scrapped 
according to the second development plan. 
  Mohammad-Khan stated that oil revenue constitutes the 
country's highest source of income. He said: Tax incomes are 
very low in comparison; during the past five years the country's 
economy has moved from a disorderly and irregular situation to a 
disciplined, steady, and structured economy.

  [Excerpt] Baroda 10 June. Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] 
President L.K. Advani has said that India should develop nuclear 
weapons and should not come under pressure from the United 
States or world public opinion for the sake of the country's 
unity, security, and integrity. 
  Addressing the three-day convention of the party's National 
Council, Advani said that the United States speaks about nuclear 
nonproliferation with the aim of having India subcontract its 
national security to it and getting unhindered access to Indian 
markets. 
  About 3,000 delegates from throughout the country are 
attending the BJP National Council convention. 
  Advani said that Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao has come 
under U.S. pressure. The national interests are being 
compromised to please the United States. Commenting on the 
government's statement in parliament on `Prithvi' and `Agni' 
missiles, he said our self-prestige has come down to the extent 
that we rush into apologizing at each hint of any U.S. 
displeasure. He asked: "Whether India should surrender its 
security interest to attract foreign investments?" 
  He spoke about the threats posed to India by the increasing 
U.S. tilt toward Pakistan. He also cautioned the country 
against the compromising stand of the Narasimha Rao government, 
which is affecting national socioeconomic interests. He called 
for the Rao government to be toppled. He said that the 
Narasimha Rao government is ignoring the U.S. steps favoring 
Pakistan's nuclear efforts and according the Most Favored Nation 
status to China. It is a result of the government's wrong 
policies that Pakistan through the Inter-Services Intelligence's 
inspired terrorist violence and bomb explosions is waging a 
proxy war. He added that these Pakistan efforts are part of 
other wider designs, which can be much more dangerous, 
especially if the government's response remains weak. 
  Advani said that foreign investment and world opinion have 
importance, but to base decisions alone on them is tantamount to 
abandoning the national interests. Nobody could imagine that 
this country of 900 million would go begging in front of others. 
He said India should act courageously and go nuclear. China 
and Pakistan are already nuclear powers. In view of this, India 
should not hesitate to acquire this capability. This will also 
change the outlook of other countries toward India and we will 
get our due place in the world. 
  Referring to Rao's recent visit to the United States, Advani 
said he had abandoned national interests to please the United 
States. Even the `Prithvi' missile tests had been postponed and 
the prime minister had not felt even slightly embarrassed while 
announcing this decision. Advani said that the most important 
issue at this time is to acquire a respectable status for India 
in the comity of nations, but the Narasimha Rao government is so 
keen to weaken the country that any country is able to damn it. 
  Advani said the present government has not only failed to 
deal with the international situation, it has also not resolved 
domestic issues. The Kashmir situation is progressively 
deteriorating. There is no let up in acts of terrorism and even 
Jammu has become their target. He said that, due to the lack of 
right policies and a unified command, the government has failed 
to deal with terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. 
  In his speech, Advani mainly targeted the prime minister and 
his three-years of administration. He said he himself felt 
embarrassed, recalling that he had once compared Narasimha Rao 
to the late Lalbahadur Shastri. 
  Advani described it as very unfortunate that, by raising a 
bogey of isolation, the government on the one hand is ruining 
the country's economy, and on the other its zeal for increasing 
foreign investment is even endangering national security. The 
indiscriminate entry of multinationals in the name of 
liberalization has threatened the very existence of the domestic 
industry. Violence, criminality, and corruption have touched 
extreme limits and scandal is synonymous with this government. 
Advani said the government is bringing forward the so-called 
electoral reforms bill to clip the wings of Chief Election 
Commissioner T.N. Seshan, who is trying to root out corruption, 
and to halt the growing strength of the Bharatiya Janata Party. 
The party will oppose it at every stage. He said attempts made 
to convert Rao's minority government into a majority one are not 
hidden from anyone. Rao first divided Janata Dal, Telugu 
Desam, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, and Shiv Sena and later admitted 
the dissident groups into the Congress-I by paying an 
`appropriate price'. Advani said Rao even unsuccessfully tried 
to divide the Congress-I ally Anna-Dravida Munnetra Kazagham. 
  The BJP president said that, as well as encouraging 
defections, the present government also ranks first in 
corruption. This government, which created all sorts of 
obstacles for a probe into the Bofors gun deal, has also not 
taken action against those involved in the securities scam. 
  He said he considers Narasimha Rao and the Congress-I 
responsible for the current round of ethnic war and anarchy in 
Uttar Pradesh following the assumption of power by the Bahujan 
Samaj Party-Samajwadi Party coalition in the state; because of 
the Congress-I support the state government has been formed 
there. 
  Referring to the [Temple-Mosque] Ayodhya issue, the BJP 
president said the construction of a Ram temple at the 
birthplace of Lord Ram has become inevitable. This has been 
accepted even by those who earlier opposed it. No one now talks 
about reconstructing the Babri Mosque. Impressions have been 
created for the last few months that the temple will be 
constructed by a government trust and not by the Ramjanambhoomi 
trust, but the people will never allow this to happen. [passage

  [Text] Baroda -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has 
reaffirmed that the swadeshi [national] approach to development 
is the bedrock of its economic policy, rejecting what the party 
has called the Rao-Manmohan Singh model. 
  The economic resolution adopted by BJP's national council on 
Saturday demanded that the present economic policy be replaced 
with a swadeshi model based on Mahatma Gandhi's Ram Rajya and 
Deen Dayal Upadhya's Integral Humanism. 
  The resolution was moved by Satish Agarwal, former Union 
Minister of State for Finance and a member of BJP's economic 
cell, and seconded by the party general secretary M. Venkaia 
Naidu. 
  Concerned over the sugar muddle which hit the country 
recently, BJP demanded the resignation of Union Minister of 
State for Food Kalpanath Rai and expeditious completion of the 
enquiry by Public Accounts Committee into the scandal. 
  At Baroda, BJP took special care to see that the confusion 
prevailing inside and outside the party over the swadeshi 
approach was clarified once and for all to set at rest all 
speculation about the party being divided on the GATT versus 
swadeshi issue. The party had failed to put these issues in the 
right perspective at the Hyderabad national executive less than 
three months ago. 
  Party leaders had no hesitation in admitting that their 
failure to clarify the concept of swadeshi had led to confusion 
among the rank and file. That was sought to be corrected as BJP 
president L. K. Advani put it in his speech. 
  Swadeshi is not merely an issue of goods produced in India 
versus foreign goods. It was an all-embracing philosophy which 
has "civilisational, political and economic dimensions, " he 
said. 
  The economic policy pursued by Congress which was contrary 
to 
the spirit of swadeshi in effect meant "wholesale and shameless 
capitulation before foreign vested interests, the lowest point 
of which was the signing of the GATT treaty at Marrakesh," the 
economic resolution noted. 
  The Rao-Manmohan Singh model of development was based on 
three legs: Fiscal stabilisation, economic re-structuring, 
foreign investment and globalisation. BJP felt the government 
had placed "misplaced faith" in foreign investment and 
globalisation as a "panacea for all our ills." 
  BJP accused the government of subserving the needs of 
foreign 
vested interests in order to attract foreign investment. The 
government had made "shoddy compromises" affecting economic 
sovereignty and security interests of the country in relentless 
pursuit of globalisation. 
  The resolution clarified that the BJP was not against the 
entry of foreign capital and technology in hi-tech areas. But 
it cautioned that even here it should not be to the exclusion of 
Indian companies. 
  The net result of Rao Government's economic policy was that 
prices of essential commodities had risen by 50 per cent in the 
last three years, unemployment was on the rise, there was 
stagnation in agriculture and recession in industrial growth, 
the country had fallen into a debt trap and corruption and 
scandals had become the order of the day. 
  The resolution said the performance of the government on the 
economic front was "dismal".

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Agonising After the Event"] </F>
  [Text] The moaning and groaning over the GATT agreement is 
now kept going, not so much by the political parties opposed to 
it as by the spokespersons of the Government which is the 
signatory of the Final Act. The Commerce Minister, Mr. Pranab 
Mukherjee, who had been in the forefront of doughty defenders 
and did much to put heart into doubters, is himself raising 
questions which ought to have been thought through before the 
event, rather than being debated after it. Inaugurating a 
workshop in New Delhi on `Impact of GATT Accord on Indian 
Economy', Mr. Mukherjee has called for an extensive debate on 
several issues going into the very heart of the matter. The 
questions he listed were: whether there would be efficient 
reallocation of world resources as a result of the pact; whether 
a rule-based multilateral trading system like the World Trade 
Organisation (WTO) would really provide a level playing field 
for all the countries to compete on fair ground: whether the 
10-year transitional period should be rolled over or rolled 
back; whether the agreement would expose the Indian small-scale 
sector to unfair or uneven competition; and whether the new 
trade blocs such as the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA) would in any way affect the multilateral trading system. 
  It would be readily seen that each and every issue that Mr. 
Mukherjee has posed has a vital bearing on the entire rationale 
and relevance of the Uruguay Round, and indeed on the very 
justifiability or otherwise of India's participation in it. As 
such, one would have presumed that extensive studies would have 
been undertaken by the Government on all the aspects now brought 
up by Mr. Mukherjee and the official negotiators would have 
fully armed themselves with the necessary conclusions to enable 
them to protect India's interests in the course of the Round. 
It is really puzzling that Mr. Mukherjee should wring his hands 
and pass the buck at this belated stage to the general public to 
debate these issues and thus take himself off the hook. 
Assuming that (but perish the thought), the debate he seeks 
shows the Government's decision to subscribe to the Final Act in 
a damaging light, it would only mean that instead of doing its 
homework while there was still time, the Government is casting 
about for excuses for locking the stables after the horses have 
been stolen. 
  Equally inexplicably, Mr. Mukherjee throws the onus on the 
public to debate and advise what legislative changes are needed 
for incorporating the GATT requirements and provisions within 
the Indian legislative framework. Specifically, he wants to 
know whether a law on plant breeders' rights should take the 
route of extending the patents or of a sui generis system or of 
both. As regards the lines along which India's laws should be 
brought in conformity with the Final Act, whether by fresh 
enactments or by amendments, one would have thought that the 
whole leviathan of a Law Ministry would have put Mr. Mukherjee 
wise by this time. And as for plant breeders' rights, Mr. 
Mukherjee's poser is yet another sad reminder of the 
Government's policy of preferring the bliss of ignorance to the 
folly of being wise about what happens right under its nose. 
  As long ago as March 1990, the Standing Policy Planning 
Committee of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research had 
gone in great depth into the nature and scope of safeguards for 
gene patenting and plant breeders' rights and after a 
comparative analysis of laws in other countries, made detailed 
recommendations for a sui generis system. In January 1994, 
following a wide-ranging, four-day, interdisciplinary dialogue, 
the Dr. M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation at Madras, had 
forwarded a comprehensive sui generis draft of a Plant Varieties 
Recognition and Protection Act. Mr. Mukherjee's colleague in 
the Central Cabinet, Mr. Balram Jakhar, had heartily welcomed 
the contribution of the dialogue towards formulating an 
effective sui generis system. Thus, Mr. Mykherjee already has 
all the answers on this specific question. All he needs is to 
ensure that the right hand of the Government knows what the left 
hand is doing. 
  The one major policy issue that is still remaining, 
unresolved is the one whereby the US in particular, is insistent 
on linking trade with social issues such as labour standards, 
environment, human rights and the like. Mr. Mukherjee is right 
in warning that this will lead to needless discussion and 
confusion, and distract the WTO from substantive trade issues 
which should be its prime concern, especially at a stage when 
the foundation of a new world trade order is being laid. Ways 
of preparing an enduring design and architecture of that 
edifice, rather than frills like the colour of the ink making up 
the drawings, should consume all its attention.

<F P=106> [Article by Avinash Singh: "It's sleek, but punch is </F>
deadly"] 
  [Text] New Delhi, June 4 
  A bolt from the blue, sleek and deadly; 

    It knows no friends, only enemies; 

    A weapon of today; it shall remain, 

    The weapon of tomorrow 
  India's Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme 
(IGMDP), aimed at the country emerging as a missile power not 
dependent on outside technology, got a major boost today when 
the third generation surface-to-surface medium-range Bharal 
Dynamics Limited (Hyderabad) product Prithvi hit its 
pre-determined target at Wheelers Island 75 km from the point of 
its take-off at Chandipur-on-sea in Orissa. 
  This was the 12th successful trial in 13 attempts since the 
first silver-white 40-250 km range missile was test-fired from 
Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh in February 1988. The weekend's 
achievement is a watershed as it was the first user's trial, to 
be followed by another on Monday and more under battlefield 
conditions in land firing ranges in other parts of the country 
soon. 
  While Saturday's glitch-free launch from a movable-launcher 
established India's credentials as a missile power that can 
deliver a range of such weapons of tomorrow anytime. The trial 
should also set the speculation at rest that India was bowing to 
any pressure to abandon its missile programme under any external 
pressure. 
  Early this year India had accomplished its "mission" as far 
as perfecting its capability in the Intermediate Range Ballistic 
Missile (IRBM) was concerned by successful test-launching of 
1,200-2,500 km range Agni. 
  Prithvi's trial came close on the heels of the announcement 
that low-level quick reaction Trishul and medium-range 
high-altitude Akash missile are ready for induction in the Army 
after their user's trials are through. The `fire and forget' 
anti-tank missile Nag has already made its prowess known to many. 
  If Agni was the first Indian missile in the true ballistic 
class, Prithvi, one of the most advanced projectiles, is India's 
own version of Scud. While Scud follows ballistic trajectory, 
Prithvi's flight throughout is controlled by an on board 
computer. The last Prithvi trial was conducted on May 30 1993. 
  Prithvi definitely gives India a better option to attack 
static targets, important defence installations, air defence 
sites, ordnance factories and large army maintenance areas which 
should fall in it range. 
  Earlier, in two Indo-Pak wars these installations were 
attacked by Indian Air Force bombers. In today's advanced world 
of early airborne warning system (AWACS), and improved radar 
systems, it is easy to detect an enemy plane and neutralise it. 
  However, in case of theatre ballistic missile, that Prithvi 
is, it is difficult to detect it on radar and also find out its 
trajectory and impact point because of its supersonic speed and 
limited flight time. 
  Covering of 75 kms in four minutes time today was a pointer 
to the fact that very few weapons could be effectively used 
against an astra like this. It certainly is an offensive weapon 
with clinical. [sentence as published] 
  To quote an Indian expert: "Prithvi is extremely accurate 
(its circular error probability -- CEP -- is lower than most 
missiles of its class) and four of them can devastate front of 
an attacking army effectively blunting an enemy attack on the 
ground." 
  As per some of the international defence journals, Prithvi 
can carry several types of warhead like high explosive, 
prefragmented, cluster munitions and fuel air explosives (FAE). 
The last mentioned can cause four time the damage done by an 
ordinary nuclear bomb. These journals insist that Prithvi has 
the capability to carry nuclear and chemical warheads too, a 
factor on which Indian scientists are tight-lipped. 
  Prof Abdul Kalam, who along with Maj. Gen. V.J. Sundram, is 
the brain behind the Prithvi project has, however, said more 
than once that this missile can carry five types of conventional 
warheads only. 
  Prithvi, which is being projected as the biggest threat to 
Pakistan's security and the one that could disturb the arms 
balance in the Indian sub-continent according to Americans, 
interestingly has most of its components locally made. Only 
five to ten per cent of its parts like precision sensors 
microprocessors and special alloy used for its silver-white 
exterior are imported. 
  Among the munitions developed for Prithvi are the deadly 
cluster bomblets, which are released while the missile is still 
in the air. Each of these bomblets is designed to piece armour 
or shower lethal mental fragments, a capability that is proving 
to be Pakistan's anethema. 
  The 1.1 m diameter battlefield tactical missile can come in 
two versions -- the 250 km range type with 500 kg payload and 
150 km range projectile with 1,000 kg payload. The target 
shooting range could be increased or decreased by altering the 
angles. 
  The only failure in 13 trials so far has been when the 
missile was commanded to do a 15 degree roll. Perfection has 
since been in this category too.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 4 -- The man behind the success of 
Prithvi is 62-year-old Dr Avul Pakir Jainalaben Abdul Kalam who 
believes that India should acquire deadly missiles that will put 
the fear of God into its enemies. 
  Towards that goal he has been working relentlessly for the 
past 15 years. According to his friends, Dr Kalam's only dream 
is to make India a respected, if not feared, world power by the 
end of this century. 
  Dr Kalam, an aeronautical engineer and bachelor, has been 
the 
architect of India's integrated guided missile development 
programme and the most important achievement of the programme is 
that it is the first successful endeavour in the country to 
harness indigenous talent to design and develop state-of-the-art 
tactical and strategic missiles. 
  Of the five families of missiles that he committed himself 
to 
develop and deliver four surface-to-surface missile Prithvi, 
medium range ground-to-air Akash, short-range quick reaction SAM 
[surface-to-air missile] Trishul and the Anti-tank guided 
missile Nag are close to production stage. 
  His most ambitious project, Agni, the intermediate range 
ballistic missile, has already completed three tests. For him 
Agni is truly like a child. The bachelor Tamilian in his poem, 
"Ancestors' desire" tells about his parents, now dead, wanted 
him to marry and have the children and how he could not satisfy 
their desire. 
  But after Agni was successfully launched, Dr Kalam wrote: 
"My parents appeared in my subconscious mind. 

    Smiles on their faces, tear filled eyes, blessing me 
with grace 

    For their grandson `Agni', the symbol of strength 

    And a continuity of their name." 
  In another poem "From Tipu's rockets to Agni," Dr Kalam said 
"I was walking on the historical shores (of Cauvery) in 
Srirangapatnam where two battles took place in the 18th century. 
India made the world's first war rocket. These rockets are in 
the British War Museum. Small tube with gun powder, tiny nozzle 
and warhead. The use of these rockets defeated the Britishers. 
History repeats." 
  Dr Kalam was born in the temple town of Rameshwaram six 
decades ago. Memories of doting family and a secure childhood 
explain the serenity on his face. Perhaps the only unpleasant 
event of his childhood he can remember was when he was separated 
from his brahmin friend by a new teacher who had his own ideas 
about social harmony. Dr Kalam who always sat on the front bench 
with his friend, was ordered to sit in the back row of the 
classroom. 
  "Even today, I am living with the image imprinted on my 
subconscious mind, of Ramaswamy crying in the class when I 
changed my seat to the rear row", writes Dr Kalam in his 
annotation to his book of poems "My journey". 
  Dr Kalam, the Agni man, says the benefits of defence 
research 
should also be used for humanitarian work, particularly in the 
field of medicine. He has founded a society for biomedical 
technology for this purpose. 
  After studies, Dr Kalam got his first job as an aeronautical 
engineer with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Kanpur. He 
then joined with Satellite Launch Vehicle Programme, and led the 
team that made Rohini and Menaka, those tiny rockets which 
aroused scepticism even derision. But the two rockets instilled 
pride -- and passion -- in Dr Kalam. No longer did Indian 
payloads need to ride on the French-built Centaur rockets. The 
success convinced him that with will and even without money, 
Indian science and technology could attain dizzy heights.

<F P=106> [Commentary by T.V. Venkatachalam] </F>
  [Text] India's policy of developing nuclear energy for 
purely peaceful purposes remains without any change. When the 
prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, in his address at the 
All-India Congress Committee [AICC] session a few days ago ruled 
out India unilaterally giving up the nuclear option, he was only 
restating the existing policy. The reiteration of the policy, 
however, is important because of pressures coming from two 
contrary directions. 
  On the one hand, the weapon-possessing members of the 
Nuclear 
Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT], particularly the United States, 
want India to join the NPT, renouncing the right to make the 
nuclear weapons forever. Their conception of a strange club in 
which the haves and have-nots ever remain separate is, of 
course, not acceptable to India. The NPT is due to come up for 
review next year. If and when the review takes place, India's 
attempt will be to make the treaty a nondiscriminatory 
instrument to promote global nuclear disarmament. 
  The other source of pressure on our nuclear policy is from 
developments in the neighborhood. Pakistan has not made a 
secret of its efforts to acquire the nuclear weapon. In fact, 
this development is made use of by the United States as an 
argument to persuade India into giving up its option to use 
nuclear energy for defense purposes. By coincidence, about the 
time of the AICC session came also the news of China having 
carried out another nuclear test. The NPT does not come in the 
way of the five weapon haves, who are permanent members of the 
UN Security Council, from adding to their nuclear arsenals. It 
is not surprising that the disturbing international environment 
should persuade even sections within the country to demand a 
change of the policy of purely peaceful use of nuclear energy. 
  The prime minister's statement indicated that the government 
will not give in to such demands. The prime minister underlined 
the fact that the country has been having a consistent policy on 
the nuclear issue. The first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, 
and defense minister, Mr. V.K. Krishnamenon, had clearly stated 
this policy at a Congress session in 1953, much before India 
carried out the implosion experiments. This policy remains 
valid. 
  The prime minister made it clear that the government would 
watch the trends and developments on global disarmament in 
exercising its options. He said, quote: We have the choice of 
making or not making the bomb. I do not want to leave that 
option. Unquote. In this connection, it should be noted that 
the nuclear situation today is complex. While some countries 
are in possession of the nuclear bomb, some others are in the 
process of acquiring it. But a large number of countries do not 
have any nuclear capability at all. The developing global trend 
has to be watched. To those who advocate the manufacture of the 
nuclear weapon, Mr. Rao aptly replied that if we make the bomb 
and the world tomorrow decides in favor of total disarmament, 
then what will we do? 
  The thrust of India's international policy is to promote 
disarmament and outlaw the use of nuclear weapons by all 
nations. India had put forward concrete suggestions for nuclear 
disarmament at the special session of the United Nations General 
Assembly in 1988. The stage-by-stage disarmament proposal 
presented to the UN by Rajiv Gandhi called for the conclusion of 
a new global treaty, eliminating all nuclear weapons by the year 
2010 to replace the NPT. Even by the end of the first stage in 
1994, much more was expected of the nuclear weapon powers in the 
sphere of disarmament than what has been achieved so far. 
  Mr. Narasimha Rao had followed it up with the demand for 
urgent measures to spread nuclear nonproliferation at the 
Security Council summit held in 1992. The conference of 
Nonaligned foreign ministers at their meeting in Cairo recently, 
acting on a proposal made by India, called for a special session 
of the UN General Assembly for a comprehensive assessment on the 
progress toward disarmament. The directions of India's policies 
are clear. We are for peace and we cannot accept nuclear 
subservience.

  [Text] It has been officially announced in Rabat that 
Morocco has again rejected any OAU participation in carrying out 
the self-determination referendum in the Western Sahara, which 
the United Nations has set for the end of 1994. 
  This confirmation came after the Moroccan Government 
received 
a message from the UN secretary general in which he informed 
Morocco of the appointment of two OAU representatives charged 
with the task of monitoring the work of the voter identification 
commission for the people invited to participate in the 
elections.

  [Text] Rabat, 16 Jun (MAP)--The permanent military court of 
the Royal Armed Forces in Rabat has passed jail sentences 
ranging from five to 20 years on eight defendants, six of whom 
are Moroccans and the other two Algerians, who were all charged 
with "violating laws on weapons and ammunition." 
  After six hours of deliberation, the court sentenced the 
defendant Ighiri Hassan to 20 years imprisonment and a 2,000 
dirham fine and Abdelouahed Najm to 18 years and a 1,500-dirham 
fine. The two Algerian defendants, Hamaz Sa'id and Omar 
Cheblal, both received a 15-year jail sentence and a 
1,000-dirham fine. Houcine Mouaden was sentenced to 12 years in 
prison and a 1,000-dirham fine, and both Kassou Ouali and 
Abdelkader Benjilali received a 10-year jail sentence and were 
ordered to pay a 1,000-dirham fine. Abdelkader Labsir was 
sentenced to five years imprisonment and a 1,000-dirham fine. 
  The court also ruled in favor of the confiscation of the 
weapons, ammunition, equipment, and foreign currency recovered 
and the restitution of the other equipment seized, namely a car 
and a video camera, to their rightful owners. 
  In the trial that began on 6 June, the main charges brought 
against the defendants included the possession of automatic 
weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment. The weapons 
and equipment found aboard a French-registered Mercedes car that 
had been driven through a number of European countries, all the 
way to Spain, and then to Morocco, were destined for individuals 
abroad.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: There is no doubt that any Arab meeting 
in which Syria participates must, by all criteria, be considered 
a source of strength for the Arabs in light of the current 
circumstances and challenges. By reaffirming the importance of 
Arab coordination and the need for consultations among the Arabs 
and by sticking to the constant Arab rights, Syria asserts that 
it will not be anything other than the conscience of the Arabs, 
the holder of the pan-Arab banner, and the defender of our 
nation's just causes. Nor will it allow the enemies of the Arab 
nation to impose their conditions and diktats or to harm the 
Arab will to protect and regain their rights. 
  Hence, the pressure being brought to bear on Syria will 
certainly be doomed to failure because Syria is sincere and 
serious in its endeavors to achieve a just and comprehensive 
peace. Syria also has no doubt that its battle to make true 
peace will be strenuous and difficult, particularly since the 
Israeli Government is trying to block and abort peace process 
and force it from its true path. 
  The summit meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and 
President Ilyas al-Hirawi came to show that any attempts to 
distance Lebanon from Syria will inevitably be doomed to 
complete failure. This has been proven by the facts and the 
deep-rooted, strong relations between Lebanon and Syria. It has 
also been proven by brotherly relations and constructive and 
positive cooperation maintained by both countries in the 
interest of the one people in Syria and Lebanon. 
  The challenges to which the two countries, Syria and 
Lebanon, 
are being exposed are the same in light of current events, 
developments, and interaction. Here, there is no doubt that the 
joint vision, the unified position, and the strong will between 
the two countries will enable them to deal with the current 
issues in a comprehensive manner and, consequently, to confront 
the resulting challenges and missions. 
  The peace process was a key issue in the summit talks 
between 
President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi in 
Damascus, particularly since the outcome of this process 
requires, as both presidents asserted, continued cooperation and 
coordination between the two countries and efforts to achieve a 
just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the approved 
bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  All evidence shows that the strong relationship between 
Syria 
and Lebanon stems from their true brotherhood. The Brotherhood 
and Cooperation Treaty between the two countries came to explain 
to every one trying to penetrate this relationship that ties 
between Syria and Lebanon are stronger and bigger than all 
attempts and that these ties will remain impregnable to all 
plots of treachery and any carrot and stick policy. Even if 
Israel recruits all it means, policies, and tools, it will not 
be able to harm Syria's support for Lebanon in its battle to 
liberate its land and implement Resolution No. 425, which 
stipulates the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from 
southern Lebanon immediately and unconditionally. 
  Syria, while stressing its full support for Lebanon to 
regain 
its territories, will never accept less than the return of the 
entire of the Golan Heights to the motherland, Syria. These 
Syrian Arab assertions stem from its strong desire to make the 
peace process successful and achieve its goals, as defined by 
the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  Israel is completely mistaken if it believes it can peddle 
its designs and pretexts. Syria had the last word when it 
declared that there would be no peace with occupation and that 
true peace is based on total withdrawal in return for 
comprehensive peace.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Syria Does Not Succumb to 
Pressures," AL-BA'TH says in its editorial: Once again 
pressures on Syria increase as a result of its firm patriotic 
and pan-Arab position in face of the intensive Israeli attempts 
to empty the peace process of its contents and derail it from 
its track and objective of just and comprehensive peace in the 
region. 
  The newspaper adds: This is not the first time Syria is 
subjected to pressures. Before the peace process, the pressure 
campaigns had been at their peak to draw Syria into something it 
did not want and did not approve regarding Arab land and rights. 
During the peace talks, pressures increased and took various 
forms, such as accusations, lies, and warnings all aimed at 
undermining Syria's decision which is primarily based on not 
relinquishing the national and pan-Arab rights. 
  AL-BA'TH says Syria has overcome these pressures and has not 
yielded to intimidations and maneuvers. It has been proven that 
peace for Syria is a strategic option, not a negotiations game 
or casual position for the sake of diplomatic gains. Peace is a 
principle that was presented by Syria when President Hafiz 
al-Asad called for full withdrawal in return for full peace. 
  The newspaper emphasizes: We in Syria have always been with 
the peace process. We have cooperated, and are ready to 
cooperate to render it successful, but we do not accept anything 
less than the principles set for this process. 
  Concluding its editorial, AL-BA'TH says: Syria is 
experienced in resisting and confronting pressures, and no one 
can force it to change its firm positions that represent the 
national and pan-Arab interests of its people and Arab nation. 
Syria acts in harmony with its principles and those of the 
international legitimacy in the efforts to achieve a just and 
comprehensive solution that secures the restoration of rights to 
their owners, and realizes solid peace, security, and stability 
for all parties in the region.

has been made allowing Palestinian National Authority Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat to visit Jerusalem and pray at al-Aqsa Mosque 
after he enters the self-rule areas, reportedly at the end of 
next week. 
  Notwithstanding the Israeli media campaign against president 
'Arafat's announcements during the past few weeks that he will 
definitely visit Jerusalem, the sources--who are closely 
watching the developments of the PLO-Israeli relationship--say 
that during their recent meeting in Cairo 'Arafat and Rabin 
signed a secret agreement by which Israel will allow the 
Palestinian president to visit Jerusalem and pray at al-Aqsa 
Mosque one week after he 
arrives.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 15 (AFP) -- A 
Palestinian police officer shot dead near the Jewish settlement 
of Netzarim in the autonomous Gaza Strip was killed accidentally 
by a colleague, a senior police officer told AFP Wednesday. 
  Palestinian sources said Monday the policeman had been 
killed 
by unidentified gunmen as he patrolled close to Netzarim. 
  "From the inquiry we carried out, it appears that Khalil 
Abu-Hamzah, 23, was killed immediately by a bullet fired 
accidentally by one of his colleagues," the police chief said. 
  On Tuesday the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad accused Israeli 
settlers of having killed the officer. 
  It is the first accidental shooting of a police officer by 
his colleagues since Israeli troops redeployed in the Gaza Strip 
to hand over to the Palestinian police, following the 
Israeli-PLO self-rule accord signed on May 4. 
  Two police officers died in a car accident shortly after 
they 
arrived on the Gaza Strip on May 18.

<F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the </F>
Palestinian National Authority, by 'Umar Zaydani; place and date 
not given; from the "With The Midday Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Zaydani] It has been reported recently that there 
is tension between the judicial apparatus, led by you, and the 
Palestinian police, or police officers? 
  [Abu-Middayn] I really do not know what the source of this 
information could be. In fact, cooperation between us is at its 
utmost. We hold meetings with the brothers in the security 
forces every night, particularly with brother Nasr Yusuf and the 
rest of the security officials. In fact, there is full and 
comprehensive cooperation because we are approaching a stage in 
which law should prevail and the Palestinians must be well 
protected. 
  [Zaydani] There are reports that Tunis and 'Arafat are not 
satisfied with Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf Nasr and that they will 
be replaced? 
  [Abu-Middayn] I do not know how consultations are understood 
as differences. This happens throughout the world. Some people 
might have interpretations that are different from others' 
interpretations. There is full compliance with the instructions 
President 'Arafat gave to the army, which is estimated at 
approximately 3,500-4,000 individuals. There are no major 
differences. Those who came here are soldiers who carry out the 
full orders of the leadership. I am not aware of major 
differences, but people would term consultations as differences. 
This is new logic and a new understanding of matters. 
Thousands of kilometers separate us from the leadership, 
therefore there should be consultations, especially since Israel 
is monitoring telephones and faxes. Therefore, the leadership 
summons all its commanders, or most of the decisionmakers, every 
30 days. This is quite natural. 
  [Zaydani] Does the departure of Ziyad al-Atrash and Yusuf 
Nasr for Tunis fall within these consultation? 
  [Abu-Middayn] I believe so. Even if there are different 
interpretations on the ground, President 'Arafat wants to be in 
the picture 24 hours a day. So, things cannot always be 
discussed over the telephone or in written instructions. 
Therefore, it is no more than consultation. 
  [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, your answers show that 
there are differences. 
  [Abu-Middayn] There are different interpretations, not 
differences. The interpretation of the liaison committee was 
different from that of the brothers in Tunis regarding the issue 
of prisoners and releasing them in Jericho, as well as other 
things. Such things should be solved directly between the 
president and his soldiers. I believe there is nothing more 
than this. All issues are minor things, and I hope they will 
always remain so. 
  [Zaydani] We heard that Yasir 'Arafat is mad at Ziyad 
al-Atrash concerning the transfer of prisoners to Jericho? 
  [Abu-Middayn] It is not anger. 'Arafat had another opinion. 
We do not want Jericho to turn into another Marj-al-Zuhur. This 
is the main thing. Israel wants to implicate us in this issue 
by force. These are not mistakes committed by Ziyad al-Atrash 
or others. There are things in the agreements that are still 
unclear. We are assessing these issues and trying to explain 
them together with the Israeli side each day and each hour. We 
will reach solution to these issues, God willing. 
  [Zaydani] What is the task of 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya who 
arrived in Gaza a few days ago? 
  [Abu-Middayn] 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya participated in the 
Cairo talks and he, more than others, is well versed in the 
security agreement in particular. Brother al-Yahya arrived to 
translate this agreement on the ground with the right formula. 
Not everything written on paper was clear. Therefore, brother 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al- Yahya understands the spirit of the agreement 
more than anybody else. This the task for which he came to 
Gaza. It is an important and delicate task. 
  [Zaydani] The last question, Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, deals 
with those who collaborated with the [Israeli] authorities. In 
your capacity as the official in charge of the judicial 
apparatus in the self-rule areas, are there any instructions to 
the Palestinian police regarding those people? 
  [Abu-Middayn] Regarding this issue, those who continue to 
collaborate will find no mercy on our part. There are very 
clear orders to arrest and interrogate any person suspected of 
collaborating. We will not be lenient in this regard and it 
will not be an issue for bargaining with the Israelis, as Mr. 
Rabin said: If they pursue the collaborators we will delay the 
prisoners. You cannot compare an honest fighter with a 
collaborator. Those who were collaborators is a different 
issue, but those who continued their collaboration will be 
arrested and stand trial. There is no lenience in this regard. 
Israel recently activated some cells that it recruited in the 
past. This is the nature of Israel. It has espionage 
activities in America and Pollard was sentenced to 25 years 
imprisonment in America. We will not allow this. We have 
military and economic institutions, as well as other 
institutions. We will not be lenient toward their security in 
any way. Therefore, we say to the Israelis: Keep your hands 
off those collaborators. They are your victims. We cannot be 
lenient toward this issue and toward those who continue their 
collaboration. If they caused heavy damages or the death of a 
Palestinian they will receive severe punishment, including a 
death sentence. This should be understood by the Israeli side. 
We will not be blackmailed on this issue and we will not 
succumb to Rabin's instructions. Rabin acts with the brain of a 
general, a bone breaker. He should stop this and know that this 
is a peace process. He should enjoy good performance and good 
intention. 
  [Zaydani] Will you pardon those who collaborated with the 
authorities in the past and stopped it now? 
  [Abu-Middayn] We are thinking seriously of those who stopped 
collaboration and even those who were killed. We will 
rehabilitate the children and sons of those who were killed. 
There is a plan to absorb the families of those killed into the 
society again. We consider them victims. Therefore, it is easy 
to resolve the issue of those who stopped their collaboration. 
However, we cannot be lenient toward those who continue their 
collaboration. We ask the ones who collaborated with the 
authorities in the past to report to the security centers and we 
will give them guarantees, provided that they stop any 
collaboration with the Israeli intelligence organ. 
  [Zaydani] Mr. Furayh Abu-Middayn, member of the Palestinian 
Authority, thank you very much. 
  [Abu-Middayn] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Ilyas Frayj, Bethlehem mayor and member of </F>
the Palestinian National Authority, in Bethlehem, by Fawzi 
al-Jundi, in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From 
Afar" program--recorded] 
  [Text] [al-Jundi] As a member of the Palestinian National 
Authority, can you tell us about the current situation, 
particularly in the fields of economics and services in the 
self-rule areas? Can you brief us on the efforts currently 
being made in preparation for starting the work of the 
Palestinian National Authority? 
  [Frayj] In fact, the economic situation in Jericho, Gaza, 
and 
the occupied West bank is very bad. The economic structure is 
largely crippled. Unemployment is high and exceeds 40 percent. 
The volume of monetary liquidity is limited. Despite this, we 
are making the necessary preparations to establish Palestinian 
Authority and offer the necessary services to all sons of our 
people. The people are looking forward eagerly to brother 
president 'Arafat's arrival in Palestine. As members of the 
Palestinian National Authority we will take the oath of loyalty 
to Palestine and to do our national duty. 
  [Al-Jundi] What is the proposed date for taking the oath and 
for president 'Arafat's arrival in the self-rule area? 
  [Frayj] We expect president 'Arafat to arrive before the end 
of June. We are awaiting his arrival impatiently. Naturally, 
after his arrival the oath of loyalty will be taken. 
  [Al-Jundi] Several statements were made in Israel recently 
on 
the issues of Jerusalem and the possibility of president 'Arafat 
visiting East Jerusalem. Obviously, there is Israeli opposition 
to this visit. 
  [Frayj] Israel consistently declares on all the media that 
it 
ensures freedom of worship and of visiting the holy places for 
prayer. This applies to Jerusalem and to the Christian and 
Islamic holy places there. Brother president Yasir 'Arafat has 
a right to say prayer in al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem and to 
visit Christian holy places in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Israel 
declares that it ensures freedom of worship, so this should 
apply to all believers in the three holy religions. Brother 
Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is a Palestinian Arab and a Muslim 
believer. 
  [Al-Jundi] Regarding the Palestinian establishments in 
Jerusalem, they will continue their activities in the coming 
phase. However, the Palestinian Authority clearly intends to 
establish others in Jerusalem operating in coordination with the 
Palestinian Authority in the self-rule areas. Can you brief us 
on the situation? 
  [Frayj] The Palestinian Arab establishments operating in 
occupied Arab Jerusalem will continue their duties and offer 
services normally. Israel has warned against setting up 
political establishments in East Jerusalem. The Arab 
establishments in Jerusalem deal with services and studies and 
draw up plans to serve the citizens. 
  [Al-Jundi] Will the establishments in Jerusalem be annexed 
to 
the Palestinian National Authority? 
  [Frayj] I believe that these establishments should continue 
their work. When we assume our duties as Palestinian National 
Authority contacts will continue between us and the Palestinian 
establishments wherever they may be, inside or outside the West 
bank. 
  [Al-Jundi] After the meeting held in Paris recently by the 
international committee that is coordinating aid to the 
Palestinians, approximately $42 million will be granted to the 
Palestinian National Authority to begin its work. Do you 
believe this sum is sufficient for a start, or have you received 
specific promises for additional funds? 
  [Frayj] First, we thank all countries that offered aid, 
particularly Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. 
The $42 million has been earmarked to be paid as salaries and 
costs for police and employees in Gaza and Jericho, who number 
over 12,000. Another meeting will be held in July to reconsider 
the aid. We hope that this meeting will result in funding of 
more than $100 million. We are in dire need of financial 
support to begin our work as the Palestinian National Authority. 
  [Al-Jundi] Has the Palestinian National Authority specified 
the sums needed in the coming phase within the framework of an 
overall plan for reconstruction and development in Gaza and 
Jericho? 
  [Frayj] We have plans and assessments that we submitted to 
the World Bank, the European Common Market, Japan, and other 
donor nations. We need considerable financial support to 
establish an effective National Authority and create jobs for 
the unemployed and improve medical, educational, and municipal 
services. 
  [Al-Jundi] We thank you and welcome you over the waves of 
the 
Voice of the Arabs Radio. 
  [Frayj] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Basim Abu-Sumayyah in "the occupied territories"] </F>
  [Excerpt] Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, a Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] official in Gaza, has stated that Israeli officials' 
statements that the Hamas movement receives funds from Saudi 
Arabia are groundless slander to bring pressure to bear on Saudi 
Arabia. In reply to a question by Radio Monte Carlo, al-Zahhar 
said that Saudi Arabia, as a government, has not offered any 
financial assistance to the Hamas Movement. Al-Zahhar said that 
Saudi Arabia is committed to the Arab stand of supporting the 
PLO. 
  Al-Zahhar explained that Hamas receives donations from 
private persons as Zakat [alms tax] funds, which are collected 
from Muslims and offered to the mujahidin in all parts of the 
world. These also include donations to the poor, and to the 
families of martyrs and detainees. He said that these donations 
are received from many countries, not just from Saudi Arabia and 
are not government funds. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Gaza correspondent 'Amira Hess] </F>
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Hasan 'Asfur, a leader of the 
Palestinian People's Party (formerly the Communist Party) and a 
senior participant in the negotiations for the Declaration of 
Principles and the Cairo agreement, was expelled from the 
party's ranks in a special session of the central committee held 
in the West Bank earlier this week. According to party members, 
the decision came "due to 'Asfur's role in the negotiations that 
led to the Cairo agreement on 4 May, an agreement repudiated by 
the party." 
  'Asfur's membership in the central committee had been frozen 
in the past few months due to his participation in the Cairo 
talks. Upon returning to the Gaza Strip after a 26-year absence, 
'Asfur, a resident of 'Abasan, was appointed as supervisor of 
the civilian and military talks. 
  The communique issued by the central committee reiterates 
the 
party's opposition to take part in the self-government. 
Following the signing of the Cairo agreement, senior party 
members in the Gaza Strip had been pushing to join the 
Palestinian Authority institutions "in order to promote 
democratization," although "this runs counter to the Palestinian 
People's Party's official line, whereby we should not 
participate in any official institution of the self-rule 
authority." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Mr. 'Ala'eddin Borujerdi, deputy foreign minister of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran who has recently come to Kabul, in 
an interview with a Bakhtar Information Agency correspondent, 
said: We have no specific plan for the solution of 
Afghanistan's current problems. As a result of meetings and 
talks, however, we learned that all sides reject fighting, and 
this is a point that raises hope for the future. 
  Borujerdi said he met with esteemed Professor Borhanoddin 
Rabbani, president of Afghanistan; esteemed Ahmad Shah Masud 
[chairman of the Kabul City Security Commission]; esteemed Dr. 
Najibollah Lafra'i, minister of state for foreign affairs; and 
esteemed Hekmatyar. He said he conducted useful talks with them 
on the current changes in the country. 
  The deputy foreign minister of the Islamic Republic of Iran 
also said his visit to Kabul has taken place on the basis of 
good neighborliness. He said: On my suggestion, Hekmatyar 
agreed to give electricity to Kabul for four hours a day. He 
expressed the hope that a solution could also be found for 
getting food to Kabul. 
  Answering another question, Mr. Borujerdi said: The economic 
cooperation agreements signed by both countries are being 
implemented, and cooperation is being carried out in the secured 
areas of the country. In response to another question, 
Borujerdi said: Afghanistan's Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami can resolve 
its internal problems itself. I did meet with Mr. Mazari and 
Mr. Akbari. The problems of Hezb-e Wahdat Eslami, however, are 
this party's own problems. I am confident it will find [words 
indistinct] to resolve them. We are ready to help to resolve 
their problems [words indistinct].

  [Text] Colombo, June 15 (AFP) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger 
guerrillas have dropped their key demand for a ceasefire and 
offered to resume talks aimed at ending the island's ethnic 
bloodshed, a Tamil tiger spokeman said Wednesday. 
  The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) spokesman in the 
northern Jaffna peninsula, said the group was willing to open 
political dialogue with the President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga's 
government without pre-conditions. 
  Quoted by a BBC correspondent who travelled to the isolated 
area, LTTE idealogue Anton Balasingam said the group no longer 
insisted on a ceasefire and the lifting of an economic embargo 
on their Jaffna stronghold as a prerequisite to opening talks. 
  Balasingam called for a political initiative from the 
Colombo 
government, but at the same time accused it of preparing for war 
in the north of the country, where the Tigers run a parallel 
administration. 
  In February last year, the LTTE offered to compromise on its 
main demand for a seperate state called Eelam, and said it was 
willing to accept a federal constitution that would give 
minority Tamils greater autonomy. 
  However, the government remained skeptical and described the 
LTTE overtures as a ploy to head off a military onslaught 
against the rebels who have waged a protracted guerrilla 
campaign since 1972. 
  Government security forces in the LTTE-dominated north are 
confined to a handful of heavily defended military camps while 
the administration is carried out through civil servants of the 
minority Tamil community. 
  Fourteen months of direct talks between the LTTE and Colombo 
collapsed in June 1990, leading to a revenewed round of 
bloodletting that continues to add to the daily death toll in 
the island's northern and eastern regions. 
  The government for its part has insisted LTTE supremo 
Velupillai Prabhakaran must be directly involved in any future 
negotiations and that the Tigers must declare their "intent" to 
lay down arms and recognise other Tamil groups.

[position as heard], about the use of helicopter gunships 
against the Kashmiri people in the occupied territories. The 
spokesman said that it might escalate to a dangerous level the 
Indian campaign of atrocities in occupied Kashmir. He said that 
India should not forget what happened in Afghanistan.

  [Text] Pakistan has deeply regretted the kidnapping of two 
British nationals from occupied Kashmir and has called for their 
immediate and unconditional release. A Foreign Office spokesman 
briefing newsmen in Islamabad said Pakistan has always condemned 
the acts of terrorism regardless of their motivation. He said 
consistent with our policy, the Government of Pakistan strongly 
urges that the British nationals should be released forthwith 
without any conditions. The spokesman also urged India to end 
its repression of Kashmiri people and called for the release of 
detained Kashmiri leaders, freedom fighters and journalists for 
expressing true aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir. 
The British nationals Kim Housego and David Mackie were 
kidnapped from the held-Kashmir on Tuesday by a group which has 
demanded release three of its comrades in exchange. 
  Replying to a question about the involvement of Pakistanis 
or 
members of some Pakistan-based organizations in the incident, 
the spokesman said we have no information which would 
corroborate or confirm this report. He said there are also 
rumors in New Delhi that the incident has, in fact, been 
organized by the Government of India or some of its agencies. 
  Replying to another question regarding the test of medium 
range surface-to-surface Prithvi missile by India, the spokesman 
said it is a clear rebuff of U.S. position and approaches which 
it had been trying to promote in South Asia. He said, however, 
U.S. reaction to Prithvi missile has been tepid. He said the 
United States had approached Pakistan and India last year 
offering a proposal of South Asia missile nonproliferation 
regime. He said Pakistan had responded positively to this 
proposal and suggested the concept of zero missile zone in South 
Asia. However, Indian reaction was inconclusive. The spokesman 
said we believe in equity and nondiscrimination on nuclear 
nonproliferation in South Asia and will not accept any 
unilateral approach that threatens the security of Pakistan.

  [Text] Islamabad -- Leader of the opposition, Mian Nawaz 
Sharif has said that the budget presented by the Benazir 
government has put the poor people in a fix. At the same time 
he criticised the government for nominal increase in the defence 
budget. 
  "Indians are building missiles and our government is 
oblivious of the country's defence needs", he said while 
commenting on the federal budget Thursday in his chamber. He 
said he would make a substantive comment on the budget in his 
speech in the National Assembly. "However my initial impression 
is that the budget has broken the back of poor people." he said. 
  He said he did not find a single word for the poor in the 
finance minister's budget speech. He said that increase in the 
gas prices would result in increase of prices of every commodity. 
  About the 35 per cent increase in the salary of government 
servants, he said that it was good. But added that what would 
happen to the ordinary labourer and to the people who were not 
government servants. He said government had proposed no 
programme for their well-being. 
  Nawaz Sharif lamented that the new budget offered no relief 
to the poor. He said that after going through the budget, his 
initial reaction was that the government had no economic agenda 
of its own. "They are carrying on the policies of my 
government", he said. 
  He said there was no substantive increase in the defence 
budget despite the fact that Indian missile programme posed a 
serious threat to country's security, demanding more vigilance 
and military hardware for defence. 
  He said unfortunately Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in her 
speech to the nation Wednesday said that the armed forces had 
agreed to the proposal of no increase in the defence budget. He 
said that the government should have voluntarily increased the 
defence budget. "Our armed forces are not of such character that 
they would come to Benazir Bhutto and would bet for increase in 
the defence budget". He lamented that the government was 
oblivious to the defence needs of the country. He said that the 
prime minister should have realised the need for increase in the 
defence budget. 
  He said that he would make a substantive comment on the 
budget in his forthcoming speech. 
  However, the secretary general of PML (N) [Pakistan Muslim 
League -- Nawaz], Sartaj Aziz said that the budget contained a 
very heavy dose of taxation. He said that the taxation is of 
indirect nature, burden of which would be borne by the common 
people. 
  APP adds: Sartaj AZiz said that there was no "new 
initiative" by the government in the budget. He said tax net 
had been extremely widened that would adversely affect the 
common man. 
  He said there had been increase in inflation, the budget 
deficit had been brought down marginally as compared to last 
year budget and there was no development programme. He said 
bulk of the new taxation was on common man. "Never in the 
history of the country poors were burdened with such a heavy 
taxation." he added.

  [Text] Opposition leader Mohammad Nawaz Sharif has again 
alleged that the [word indistinct] Razi Farm, which President 
Farooq Ahmad Khan had sold to six residents of Karachi, is on 
barren land. He was addressing a rally near Choti Zerin in Dera 
Ghazi Khan yesterday. He was accompanied by several leaders of 
the Pakistan Muslim League and local and foreign journalists. 
  APP reports that the opposition leader's car was pelted with 
stones when he and and his procession reached Muzaffargarh. 
Police used tear gas to disperse the mob and control the 
situation. Black banners were put up at several places in 
Jampur town, on which was written: Do not turn the sale of 
personal property into a political issue. 
  The news agency reports that officials of the Revenue 
Department present at the venue provided all the necessary 
information to Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and the journalists 
accompanying him. They told newsmen that the land which the 
president has sold is a fertile and expensive agricultural farm 
called Razi Farm. Officials and people who gathered at the 
venue also explained that it is cultivable land; and wheat, 
cotton, and sugar cane are harvested in spring and fall every 
year. They said that the sale of the land to six residents of 
Karachi is legal and no forgery has been committed in this 
regard.

Wednesday [15 June] to maintain the organization's production 
ceiling unchanged at 24.52 million barrels a day (MBD), Libya's

organization's secretariat. 
  Subroto said that OPEC members had respected their quotas in 
May to a "satisfactory" extent, and that prouction for the month 
averaged 24.922 million barrels.

  [Text] Following the decision by OPEC oil ministers to 
maintain OPEC's output at the current level for the rest of the 
current Christian year, the price of oil rose on international 
markets. Our correspondent in Bonn interviewed Iranian Oil 
Minister Gholam Reza Aqazadeh on the outcome of the current OPEC 
session and its effect on international oil markets, to which we 
draw your attention. 
  [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, 
please tell us the outcome of the OPEC conference. 
  [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful. Of course, we only managed to reach a final decision 
on one of the issues on the session's agenda, and it was the 
most important item on the agenda. It was determining the 
production ceiling for the next six months. 
  The announcement of the decision that OPEC will not raise 
its 
current output for the next six months was very important for 
the market, particularly since OPEC also announced that its next 
session was cancelled. It is very important for consumers to be 
sure that OPEC does not intend to raise its output for the rest 
of the year, considering the fact that it is predicted that 
there is demand for OPEC's oil stocks of about 26.5 million 
barrels for the fourth quarter of the current Christian year. 
Therefore, the decision made yesterday was important and had an 
immediate effect on the market. 
  [Correspondent] We heard that the price of Brent oil and 
U.S. 
oil has gone up. What do you know about that? 
  [Aqazadeh] Yes, that is right. From the start of the 
session, the positive attitude of the OPEC members strengthened 
the market. We even heard that U.S. oil had risen to $20. North 
Sea oil will also show a reaction today; it rose to $17 last 
night. [end recording]

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 10 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islam issues. 
<H5>  Contents: </H5>
1. Writer Berates Government Approach to Dialogue, Sets Terms 
  2. Writer Sees Muslim Brotherhood History as Commendable 
  3. Appeal To Mubarak to Use Dialogue With Islamists 
  4. Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Denies Disagreement With

<H5>  WRITER BERATES GOVERNMENT APPROACH TO DIALOGUE, SETS TERMS </H5>
  In his 3,500-word article on page 5, Labor Party Secretary 
General 'Adil Husayn criticizes the government's approach to the 
proposed national dialogue which, he believes, would be useless 
if it were not an instrument of change and exhaustive reform. 
Stating that "national dialogue must start with political 
reform, or the right to change the ruler," he says that all 
signs indicate that the government wants one thing but the 
people want another. "We want it to be a triumph for the 
approach of democratic change, while they want it to be a 
tyrannical, terrorist setback that further establishes the 
present regime, with all its incompetence and corruption," he 
says. 
  Husayn notes that nothing in the public policy or the ruling 
approach has changed since the call for dialogue was made. "The 
most fateful laws are still being passed in a hurry without 
serious discussion," he says, pointing out that instead of 
recognizing the role of the opposition, the government has 
tightened the noose around it by taking its free writers to 
military courts and harassing the Muslim Brothers. He affirms, 
however, that "we will not boycott the dialogue, unless it is 
proven beyond a doubt and before all that they are determined to 
conspire and hatch evil plots." 
  Registering his party's objection to the formation of the 
committee in charge of preparing the national dialogue, Husayn 
sums up the terms of "collective national powers and parties." 
  He emphasizes the need for a balanced representation of 
people from various intellectual inclinations in the proposed 
general congress for the national dialogue. For this purpose he 
suggests that the total number of representatives be limited to 
"200 members for example" to ensure a balanced exchange of 
views. He stresses that National Democratic Party members 
should not be favored over other parties, that representatives 
of major parties should be increased, that no major trade or 
professional union should be excluded, that universities should 
be represented, and that the Islamic current should be 
represented compatibly with its intellectual and political 
weight in the society. 
  Moving on to the agenda of the national dialogue, he sums up 
the three self-evident principles by the following: To 
guarantee man's basic right to protect his body, dignity, honor, 
and money; to work out ways to put an end to election rigging; 
and to agree on collective objection to the use of armed force 
in political conflicts, or what he terms "the so-called civilian 
terrorism." 
  "The general congress must openly announce from the first 
moment that it will not culminate in binding resolutions, apart 
from the three self-evident principles. If you wish to expand 
the scope of discussion and exchange of views, it is alright 
with us, so long as the world will follow what is going on via 
the central mass media," Husayn concludes. 
<H5>  APPEAL TO MUBARAK TO USE DIALOGUE WITH ISLAMISTS </H5>
  In the 500-word "Quiet Message to President Mubarak" on page 
9, Muhammad Isma'il says to Mubarak that the evil retinue around 
him has put an invincible wall between him and the people, as is 
evident from the wedge driven between the president and 
Islamists in general. 
  "Some have harbored evil intentions toward Islam and 
Muslims; 
they were brought up and weaned on disbelief and infidelity. An 
opportunity was offered to them on a silver platter to release 
their suppressed poisons in the face of the Islamic revival, 
which we unfortunately failed to exploit. They used the 
country's ordeal to win your favor with their false slogans and 
insincere words," he writes. 
  "Whoever told you, Mr. President, that Islamists have 
ambition to rule or to take your chair is a liar and an 
unethical hypocrite," he states. 
  Explaining that emergency laws, arrests on suspicion, and 
scaring and framing the people have not succeeded in stopping 
terrorism, he pleads with the president "to try, even for once, 
the approach of dialogue and good counselling; use love rather 
than hatred, tolerance rather than spite, and sincerity rather 
than ill will." He proposes to the president to give scholars 
the chance to talk to Islamists first in jail and then outside 
of jail, and to give orders to stop torturing prisoners and 
improve their living conditions. He affirms that accepting 
dialogue or mediation with our sons will strengthen rather than 
weaken the government. 
<H5>  WRITER SEES MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD HISTORY AS COMMENDABLE </H5>
  A 400-word article by Ahmad 'Izz-al-Din on page 7 comments 
on 
"the security and media clampdown on the Muslim Brotherhood" and 
the repeated use of the term "secret organization" to refer to 
the organization. 
  Referring to a report in the 3 June issue of the weekly 
magazine AL-MUSAWWAR, filed as NC1106202194 and add, he says 
that what the magazine terms secret documents of the Muslim 
Brotherhood were based on "a confidential memorandum written by 
Brigadier General M.R. of the State Security, hoping to present 
the Muslim Brothers as an easy prey to the regime to exterminate 
them." 
  'Izz-al-Din emphasizes that even if the information revealed 
in the magazine report was true, the Muslim Brothers' quest to 
impose themselves on the political map and their wish to avoid 
provoking the security apparatus could not be described as a 
secret action or as terrorism. 
  "AL-MUSAWWAR's security report has unmasked some positive 
aspects in the secret group that are lacking in the public 
ruling party and other overt political powers. Among these is 
the fact that the elections of the secret organization are being 
done by free and secret balloting and that everyone will have an 
equal opportunity to run for the leading positions," 'Izz-al-Din 
says. 
  The writer adds that it is alright to uncover more hidden 
facts about that secret organization, because "what the 
government sees as criticism we see as praise and what it sees 
as a vice we see as a virtue." 
  He concludes: "If the government keeps up its current 
course, the Muslim Brothers will gain more prominence and 
popular support. They will even walk the streets and call: This 
is the secret organization; who wants to join?" 
<H5>  MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD SPOKESMAN DENIES DISAGREEMENT WITH LABOR </H5>
PARTY 
  An unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says that Ma'mun 
al-Hudaybi, official spokesman of the Muslim Brotherhood, denied 
a report published in the "last" issue of the AL-'ARABI 
newspaper, which quoted him as saying that "the Labor Party does 
not represent the Muslim Brotherhood and we disagree with 
Ibrahim Shukri." 
  Al-Hudaybi explains that the newspaper distorted his words 
and that he did not say that there was a disagreement between 
the Muslim Brotherhood and the Labor Party. He affirmed that 
what he said was: "With all due respect to Ibrahim Shukri and 
the Labor Party leaders, the party--as stated by its leader 
Ibrahim Shukri--does not represent the Muslim Brotherhood on the 
committee in charge of preparing for national dialogue." 
<H5>  REPORT SAYS SECURITY FORCES `LIQUIDATED' ISLAMISTS </H5>
  A 120-word report by 'Adil al-Bahnasawi on pages 1 and 7 
says 
that security forces used armored cars to bulldoze the house in 
which four members of the Islamic Group were hiding in Tama, 
when these forces failed to arrest them. The four were 
"liquidated" after the house was bulldozed completely. 
  The report adds that the security forces, in a separate 
incident, took four Islamists from jails in Asyut and three 
students in a police car to a cemetery in Tahta, where they were 
tied-up and shot dead. 
<H5>  LAWYERS ASSOCIATION DETERMINED TO UNCOVER LAWYER'S KILLERS </H5>
  An 800-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi and Khalid Yunus on 
pages 1 and 7 cites Ahmad Sayf-al-Islam Hasan al-Banna, 
secretary general of the Lawyers Association, as he affirms at a 
press conference that the association's crisis is "purely 
professional" and that the association was only acting upon its 
established principle to protest the violation of the rights of 
one of its members to live. In the report, al-Banna affirms that 
the association will keep up its efforts until the names of the 
officers who were responsible for the death of Lawyer 
'Abd-al-Harith Madani are publicized. 
  "Unless the government takes the necessary legal measures, 
we 
will lodge a complaint with the UN Human Rights Commission to 
launch an investigation," al-Banna said. He added that an 
official in the American Middle East Watch Human Rights 
Organization will meet with the Association members to discuss 
the case. 
  Al-Banna stressed that the government cannot dissolve the 
association's council and that a court ruling in al-Sadat's time 
emphasized that it is unconstitutional to dissolve the council.

<F P=106> [Report by Salah Sabir] </F>
  [Text] The Research Center for International and Political 
Development has organized a seminar on the points of agreement 
and difference between three major currents within the Islamic 
movement. These currents are the Muslim Brotherhood, the radical 
Islamic groups (al-Jihad current), and al-Azhar. 
  The differences between these three currents were pinpointed 
regarding their stands on the Copts, the class distinctions 
between the leaders and cadres in these three currents, the 
state and social institutions, relations with the outside world, 
and the organizational peculiarities of each of these currents. 
  Regarding the differences, some of those who took part in 
the 
discussions were of the opinion that there are no differences 
between the Muslim Brotherhood and other extremist Muslim 
currents and that what the Muslim Brotherhood is currently 
claiming--that it rejects violence and accepts pluralism and 
democracy--is a tactical stand. This stand is based on the 
principle of dissimulation [al-taqiyah] which they adopted from 
the Shiite doctrine. Those who expressed this viewpoint were 
Dr. Majdi 'Allam, secretary of the National Democratic Party's 
youth branch in al-Jizah, and Major General Fu'ad 'Allam, who 
noted that the idea of accusing society of being blasphemous is 
being copied from what the Brotherhood's youth wing did in 1946. 
Shaykh al-Banna did not reject it, although he did point out 
that it is not in their interest to revive these ideas at this 
point in time, before the Muslim Brotherhood has taken control 
of the state, and he said that they should not provoke conflicts 
with the state while they are weak. These same ideas were 
revived by Sayyid Qutub during the early sixties. He leaked 
them from prison and they reached the Guidance Bureau. Qutub's 
stand was the same as that of the former imam. Therefore, there 
are no differences among the various groups, nor between them 
and the Muslim Brotherhood. The apparent differences are 
personal ones over leadership, or because one group indulges in 
infighting with another, or for reasons dealing with the 
weakness or strength of some group or the availability or 
absence of funding for it. 
  Others believe that a distinction should be made between two 
things: The political approach and the actual behavior of the 
Islamic groups, with all their differences. Regarding the 
Brotherhood's political approach, we find that much of it is 
blasphemous. As for their current behavior, we find that they 
have moved away from violence. The Brotherhood and al-Azhar 
agree with the other groups with respect to their political 
lines, but differences remain in their actual behavior. Those 
holding this opinion were Dr. Jihad 'Awdah, head of the Research 
Center for International and Political Development; Dr. 'Ali 
Fahmi; and Alain Rousion [last two names as transliterated], 
head of the Sidage Center. 
  On the other hand, the points of agreement between the 
Islamic movement's three currents were spotlighted, such as 
their stand on implementing the Islamic shari'ah, the rule of 
non-Muslims, assessing the West's political approach and 
economic dealings, and on general social and cultural factors. 
The three currents agree on implementing the shari'ah, setting 
up an Islamic caliphate, disdaining Muslim rule over 
non-Muslims, and being hostile to the West (by using hostile 
slogans), and on having economic dealings with the West as long 
as it is in the interest of the Muslims. The seminar concluded 
by proposing many ideas. The most important of these were: 
  -- Finding a link between the growth of the Islamic 
movements 
in the Islamic world and funding coming from the oil-producing 
countries. This explains the reason why there is a similarity 
between the Islamic groups' thinking and the Pakistani and 
Wahabi ideas. 
  -- By dealing with religious violence solely through 
oppression without looking into the social and economic issues, 
the state encourages increased religious extremism. Ambassador 
Tahsin Bashir supported this idea. 
  -- Al-Azhar does not disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood 
and 
the Islamic groups on the level of jurisprudence, only on the 
mechanism for relations with others. 
  -- The concept of al-shari'ah is vague and general. There is 
no such thing as al-shari'ah, but there is jurisprudence. 
Whoever talks about al-shari'ah is talking about a defined and 
strict regime that incorporates some ideas of jurisprudence and 
ignores others. It uses the former to govern with. This leads 
to the establishment of a theocracy which, according to 
jurisprudence itself, is contrary to true Islam. This notion 
was confirmed by Dr. 'Ali Fahmi.

  [Text] [Announcer] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the 
regent, today received Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN 
secretary general to Yemen. The latest Yemeni developments and 
efforts to resolve the conflict were discussed during the 
meeting. Brahimi arrived in Amman at dawn today. 
  Speaking to reporters on his meeting with His Highness Crown 
Prince Hasan, Brahimi said: 
  [Brahimi] First of all, I was very pleased to meet with 
his royal highness and to listen to what he said on the subject 
of Yemen because Jordan played a role in trying to bring views 
closer. We greatly benefited from his information and views. I 
thanked him and asked him to convey my greetings and best wishes 
to his majesty the king. I hope we will continue to be in 
contact with Jordan as is the case with other parties in order 
to follow up the issues we are undertaking. 
  [Announcer] On the outcome of his meetings in Yemen, Brahimi 
said: 
  [Brahimi] Regarding the outcome of our meetings, 
contacts and talks with the parties are continuing. 
  [Announcer] Asked about the nature of his mission in Yemen 
and the conflicting parties' cooperation with the international 
efforts, Brahimi said: 
  [Brahimi] We are doing two things. We are collecting 
fact-finding information for a report to the secretary general. 
In the meantime, and because we are working in a region to 
which we belong, we are trying to bring closer the views of 
brothers with whom we are linked by old ties. Sometimes, we 
make progress and sometimes we do not; but we are continuing 
talks. I told you two things. There is preparation for a 
report and this is very easy, but in the meantime we try not to 
be satisfied with this. We try to achieve the two basic points 
on which the whole world is unanimous and the Yemeni brothers do 
not object to them. These are the need to stop fighting and 
entrench the cease-fire and to start dialogue between them. We 
are considering the possibility of entrenching the cease-fire 
and opening the door for dialogue among brothers.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday sent PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat a letter in which he replies to the three 
messages sent by the PLO chairman over recent days. The Rabin 
response was sent to 'Arafat through a Palestinian mediator. 
Earlier this week the prime minister said 'Arafat's letters 
dealt with issues relating to the autonomy agreements and 
problems that have arisen in the territories. Qol Yisra'el's 
diplomatic correspondent says it appears the issues include the 
closure on the territories, and clashes in Hebron between 
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and civilians.

<F P=106> [Report by political affairs correspondent Salim 'Ali Dhiyab] </F>
  [Excerpts] In a meeting with His Highness Prince Hasan, the 
regent, Lakhdar Brahimi reviewed UN efforts on Yemen and his 
contacts with the parties to the conflict. His highness the 
crown prince reiterated Jordan's position -- that it supports 
the unity of Yemen and a cessation of hostilities. 
  Speaking to reporters, Brahimi praised Jordan's clear stand 
on and efforts for the sake of Yemen. [passage omitted] 
  Brahimi had earlier called on acting Prime Minister Dhuqan 
al-Hindawi, who told him Jordan supports his efforts as a 
special UN envoy to Yemen to heal the rift and bring the ongoing 
hostilities there to a halt. 
  Mr. Brahimi arrived in Amman last night, and said at the 
airport that it is the UN's and his own role in Yemen to gather 
information and act as a conduit between the parties to the 
conflict. 
  [Begin recording] [Brahimi] We must build on the fact that 
the two sides have accepted the UN Security Council cease-fire 
resolution and that both are amenable to the principle of 
dialogue, although specifics like what, how, and when are yet to 
be agreed on. Now there is talk about a mechanism to be devised 
by the Yemenis to solidify the cease-fire. Each of the two 
sides has put forward ideas of its own. God willing, these will 
take shape on the ground. Now the brothers in the Republic of 
Yemen in Sanaa are talking about a joint committee with members 
other than Yemenis sitting on it. However, it remains for them 
to agree on specifics such as who is to be represented on it and 
how it is going to work. That is all there is for the time 
being. 
  [Dhiyab] Will Jordan and Oman, both of which were on the 
committee, still be there? 
  [Brahimi] I do not think either of the two Yemeni sides will 
object to that. Nor will they mind the presence of the 
Americans, the French, and the Russians. Whether there will be 
other parties may be a bone of contention. [end recording] 
  Lakhdar Brahimi has now left Amman. Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, 
minister of state for foreign affairs; and the UN representative 
in Jordan were on hand to bid him farewell.

<F P=106> [Speech by Crown Prince Hasan, regent, at Third Arab Youth </F>
Forum conference in Amman on 15 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] I do not want here to start 
replying to certain accusations leveled at your Jordanian 
homeland. Some of these accusations may be made with good 
intentions, but most of the time they are made with bad 
intentions. Over the past 70 years, we have heard here and 
there descriptions of Jordan's role, the tasks it was entrusted 
to carry out when it was established, and how its role is 
threatened. We have been listening to analyses that some 
believe are convincing and with which they themselves are 
convinced. 
  Brothers and sisters, Jordan has always replied to all this 
and more with its achievements and the pursuance of its course, 
believing that homelands are not shaken by injustices and that 
their marches are not affected by doubts and skepticism. 
  Here we are pursuing the march of good that was started by 
the great Jordanian Arab people early in this century, united, 
and in response to the program of the late founder grandfather 
-- may God's mercy be upon him -- confident in the soundness of 
our beliefs, and believing in the role we have to play. We have 
not changed and we will not alter our stand. We have adopted a 
centrist stand in economy and politics and we thank God that the 
memory of the Arab citizen records and remembers. It remembers 
that Jordan is committed to what it believes, and knows that the 
means it uses are in line with the results. Jordan has never 
made any secret step, and has proven to all those who watch it 
that it is the homeland that continues to abide by what is right 
and which continues to respond to the nation's aspirations. 
  The leader of this homeland, the head of the Al-Hashim 
family, King Husayn, has raised over the past few years a slogan 
embodying the revival of unity among us, the slogan of descents 
and origins. He has also raised the following slogan: Those who 
tamper with national unity are my foes until the day of 
reckoning. 
  Brothers, some whisper or explicitly say that Jordan is for 
the Jordanians. Some prepare studies from time to time about 
statistics on who is Jordanian and who is not, and who is from a 
non-Jordanian origin. 
  I find in your conference an opportunity to sincerely 
clarify 
this point to you, and to ask: Actually, who is a Jordanian? 
Does Jordan, in the geographic sense of the word, extend only 
from al-Ramthah at al-'Aqabah? Is raising the fabricated 
contradiction between the Jordanian in the east and the 
Palestinian in the west as innocent as it appears and without 
ulterior motives? Is there a feeling of dual citizenship that 
the state has not succeeded in tackling? [passage omitted] 
  Brothers and sisters, we are a sovereign homeland that seeks 
to attain its interests without fear. We deal with developments 
frankly and sincerely. We inform all the citizens of what takes 
place around us. We participated in the peace conference with a 
popular consensus that was achieved through the national 
congress. We act with the interest of our country and nation at 
heart without hesitation, and by scientifically studying every 
step we make. We do not disparage our national capabilities but 
work to enhance them. We also do not try to assume more than we 
can. Homelands are not forged with adventures and slogans. 
[applause] 
  Brothers, this is a homeland that is realistic and one that 
can do all that is needed to further enhance its status. 
[passage omitted]

  [Text] Leader President Saddam Husayn, may God protect him, 
has presided over a cabinet meeting, the fifth since his 
excellency the president assumed the premiership on 30 May. 
  During its fifth meeting, the cabinet continued its 
discussion of some economic issues that were debated during the 
previous meetings. 
  When the issue of economic inflation was raised, the leader 
president made some remarks, saying: The Iraqi performance in 
terms of production and reconstruction, despite this artificial 
and transient inflation in the Iraqi economy, has been promoted 
over the past few years, thanks to the Iraqis' minds, as well as 
their role in building the future. 
  The leader president added: As you are well aware, the 
reconstruction drive has been carried out thanks to legendary 
efforts made in a legendary time period, and at low cost. This 
is especially true if such a drive were to be conducted by 
foreign companies. Many times the time spent and cost sustained 
would have to be made available to such companies if the results 
achieved by the Iraqi national endeavor were to be attained. 
Additionally, Iraq's wealth has remained intact. It is still 
underground. None of it has been disbursed. It has not fallen 
under the domination of foreign colonialist powers. Nor has it 
been plundered by these powers. Moreover, oil installations 
have been rebuilt. Oil is ready to be exported once the embargo 
is lifted. 
  His excellency the president went on to say: He who makes a 
naive comparison between the exchange rate of the dinar and that 
of the dollar is gravely mistaken. For can a man live on two 
dollars in the United States, or even on 10 dollars, and still 
eat meat? 
  The leader president said: So, this is not the real value of 
the Iraqi dinar. For, the Iraqi dinar is supported by a broad 
and extensive base of work, activities, and accomplishments, not 
to mention the ration card, free education, health services, and 
other services. It is true that the price of 10 dollars is too 
much if these dollars were to be exchanged for dinars. But, as 
a matter of fact, Iraqis can, by paying an equivalent of 100 
dollars, buy more commodities and services than those Americans 
can buy by paying 100 dollars. The exception to this concerns 
the prices of certain imported commodities. 
  The Council then discussed red tape at state departments and 
its side effects. His excellency the president addressed the 
cabinet ministers: The disequilibrium in public offices has not 
emerged overnight. Likewise, we realize that it is impossible 
to correct it in a single day. Nonetheless, the level of your 
hard work at present is being felt by all citizens, who feel 
that their state has become more active and vibrant. To correct 
mistakes in administrative functions, we need to focus on some 
aspects concerning citizens' affairs and transactions in order 
to simplify them. In the same vein, we need to work 
energetically and actively to correct the mistakes and 
deviations rapidly and firmly, because this is required by the 
phase we are experiencing. If we do so, this will deter those 
who make mistakes and hearten correctors. Consequently, the 
determination will grow further. We want your resolve to be at 
a high level on the first day. We want you to demonstrate 
greater vigor until the day the remedial action is completed. 
This is because any weakness in resolve will bring about new 
deviations. So, what is required now is determination, 
increased determination, and stronger determination. 
  The leader president said: The emergence of some deviations 
in our country causes us harm. It also harms the march, which 
you and your people seek to safeguard. Hence, we must work to 
make the deviant constantly feel that he will not go unpunished 
regardless of how long this might take. Your handling of red 
tape should not be guided by conventional methods. The minister 
himself must personally examine all transactions that concern 
citizens step by step. He must delve into details, cut back on 
the required procedures, paperwork, and references as much as he 
can. He must set a time limit for this, and submit proposals if 
necessary to amend regulations or laws. Likewise, he must 
submit a copy of the measures he thinks can reduce red tape to 
the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers so we may discuss 
them at our cabinet meetings.

  [Text] President leader Saddam Husayn, may God protect 
him, has chaired a meeting for a number of ministers and experts 
in trade and industrial affairs. 
  The conferees discussed several economic and trade issues, 
including the issuance of legislation punishing those who sell 
foreign currency outside the officially-licensed offices. These 
traders are regarded as thieves liable to the stipulations of 
Decree No. 59 issued by the Revolution Command Council on 4 June 
1994. Also liable to punishment are farmers who deliberately 
fail to deliver grains to the marketing centers. This includes 
merchants who stockpile items listed in the ration cards with 
the aim of monopoly and tampering with prices in a departure 
from the fixed price. This also includes the profit margin, 
which should be reconsidered in order to encourage merchants to 
trade in these items, and to put prices within a reasonable 
framework for the citizen who purchases them in addition to his 
share provided by the state through the ration card. The 
conferees agreed that the profit margin for wholesalers and 
retail merchants be declared regarding these items. 
  During the meeting, specific ideas were raised to give the 
state a positive role in stabilizing the Iraqi dinar's exchange 
rate against the dollar, and not accepting the common idea that 
the state's selling and purchasing ability is dependent upon the 
exchange rates of the dollar and dinar, which vary according to 
speculators and profiteers in the black market, who tamper with 
their exchange rates. 
  The conferees agreed on the importance of pursuing violators 
after announcing the set restrictions based on the new 
legislations. They also agreed on implementing these 
legislations with due firmness because the blockade is a form of 
war, and will remain so until it ends in decisive victory, God 
willing, through the resolve of the dedicated Iraqis and the 
glorious Iraqi women after having relied on Almighty God. 
  The conferees also agreed on the importance of deepening the 
discussions and highlighting what is agreed in a later expanded 
meeting in order to entrench it in the form of laws and specific 
regulations, so each concerned party precisely knows the limits 
of its rights and duties, and so all will work with 
determination to bring Iraq to safe shores, God willing, where 
the homeland will be cherished, lofty, and in good shape at a 
time when Iraq's people and victorious march, as well as all the 
good people, will enjoy inevitable pride which God will choose 
for them and which God will turn into a decisive victory and a 
steadfastness with an early end that promises both good and 
prosperity.

  [Text] The trial of Layada Abdelhak [member of the Armed 
Islamic Group -- GIA] began at Algiers special court today. The 
trial was due to start yesterday but had to be postponed until 
today at the request of the defense lawyers to enable them to 
examine the bill of indictment. The request was granted by the 
presiding judge who gave the defense 24 hours to examine the 
file. Over to Bachir Hedibel who attended the opening of the 
trial: 
  [Hedibel] The prosecutor general has just required the 
maximum sentence, namely the death penalty, for the defendant 
Layada Abdelhak who is appearing before the Algiers special 
judicial court. The trial of Layada Abdelhak began this morning 
after it was postponed for 24 hours at the request of his four 
lawyers. The presiding judge opened the session by reading the 
bill of indictment. The main charges brought against the 
defendant include harming the integrity of the national 
territory and the security of the state with a view to 
overthrowing the regime, leading armed groups, carrying out acts 
of sabotage against public interests, stealing weapons and 
ammunition, using violence, and committing premeditated murders 
and aggravated thefts. 
  The bill of indictment includes 21 crimes. The defendant has 
confessed to all the crimes, according to the bill of 
indictment. He also knew about the other crimes committed at the 
time he belonged to the Armed [Islamic] Group and before he went 
to Morocco on 23 September 1993. He denied all this before the 
court today repeating every time that he was only the personal 
driver of Moh Leveilley [alias for Mohamed Allal, GIA member 
killed in clash with security forces in September 1992 in 
Tamezguida] and that he never took part in any assassination 
operation against members of the national security forces. He 
added that if operations were carried out when he was the 
driver, he had no prior knowledge of these operations. He 
further said that his orders were to drive the armed groups in 
his capacity as a driver. 
  The defense lawyers concentrated on the bill of indictment 
which they regarded as being to the advantage of their client 
since there was no mention of Layada being commander [emir] of 
the group. Using this line of defense, the lawyers asked for a 
lighter sentence, especially as Layada did not deny his 
affiliation to the group. 
  The trial is continuing at this very moment and given the 
long list of charges brought against the defendant and the 
numerous cases and names mentioned during the session, we will 
limit ourselves to this for the time being and promise our 
listeners further details in later reports.

  [Text] Bonn, June 15, IRNA -- Iran's Foreign Minister 'Ali 
Akbar Velayati said in Frankfurt today that Iran will continue 
its efforts to consolidate peace and stability in the region. 
  Velayati who is here on an official visit said at a press 
conference here today that Iran will also follow its policy to 
resolve the current crises in the world through boosting 
regional and international cooperation. 
  Asked about Gaza-Jericho compromise accord, Velayati said, 
"We believe that the current peace process was not in the 
interest of Palestinian nation and peace and security in the 
region. Palestine belongs to all the Palestinians on that land 
and an individual or a certain group can not impose their views 
upon the Palestinian people." 
  Despite the declared Palestinian control" over Gaza and 
Jericho, the problems of Palestine still remain to be solved, he 
said. 
  More than 200 Jewish townships exist in the region, the 
problem of Qods [Jerusalem], Palestinian refugees and Golan 
Heights remain unresolved and the southern Lebanon is still 
under zionist occupation, he said. 
  On the date of his upcoming visit to Baghdad, Velayati said 
that an expert delegation will go to Baghdad and will designate 
the date for the visit of the two countries' foreign ministers. 
  He described the United Nations Resolution 598 as the ground 
for consolidation of Tehran-Baghdad relations and said that the 
implementation of the United Nations resolution positive steps 
[as received] would be taken to strengthen bilateral relations. 
  Asked about Iran's view on the developments in Yemen, 
Velayati said that Iran's policy favors unity and territorial 
integrity of Yemen. "We believe that the crisis in Yemen can be 
resolved through peaceful means," velayati Said. 
  On Iran's support for Bosnian Muslims, he said that despite 
some claims, Iran has not dispatched forces to interfere in 
Bosnian affairs directly. Instead it has repeatedly announced 
its readiness to dispatch 10,000-strong peacekeeping force to 
Bosnia under the banner of the Nia Oionsxmh [as received]. 
Answering a question on the export of the revolution, Velayati 
said that Iran was against the so called forcible export of the 
revolution, calling the allegation that Iran is using force to 
promote its revolution as "the fabrication of the western 
propaganda machine." 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran regards strengthening of 
regional cooperation as an important principle and makes efforts 
to expand activities of the Economic Cooperation Organization 
(ECO) and the organization of the Caspian Sea Littoral States to 
stregthen ties among neighbouring states, he said. 
  Velayati described his talks with German officials as 
positive and said that the talks opened a new chapter in 
bilateral relations in the framework of ECO and the European 
Union (EU).

  [Text] Srinagar, India, June 16 (AFP) -- Outnumbered, 
outgunned and plagued by bloody factional feuding, Kashmiri 
Moslem militant groups are nonetheless planning to intensify 
their armed struggle against Indian rule. 
  Dismissing claims by the Indian army that they are on the 
run, a top Moslem militant commander warned that the guerrilla 
movement could enter a new phase if the eight million Kashmiris 
are not allowed to decide their own fate. 
  "The militancy begun in Kashmir will engulf all of India 
soon 
if it does not accede to our demands," said Majid Jehangir, the 
deputy commander of the Hezbul Mojahedin, the most powerful 
Kashmiri Moslem militant outfit. 
  "In Punjab, the Sikh militants will rise again," said the 
33- 
year-old Jehangir, who also goes by the name Khalidul-Islam, as 
he touched a well-oiled AK-47 rifle at his feet. "They are 
reassembling and reorganizing." 
  "We will take the struggle out of the Kashmir Valley in 
stages," the burly, bearded guerrilla said at a hideout 
surrounded by gun-toting youths. "We have started the struggle 
in the Jammu region (of southern Kashmir) and we will be taking 
it to Ladakh (in the north-east) and then outside the state. 
  "The question now is how long can India hold on to Kashmir," 
said Jehangir, whose Hezbul Mojahedin favors merging India's 
only Moslem-majority state with Islamic Pakistan. "The 
expenditure on Kashmir is likely to ruin India." 
  Jehangir claimed that his group had obtained U.S.-made 
Stinger surface-to-air missiles, hundreds of which were supplied 
to the Afghan mujahedeen during their war against the 
Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, and many of which today remain 
unaccounted for. 
  "We have got three Stinger missiles," he said, "and more are 
coming." 
  He refused to disclose the source of the missiles but a 
number of former Afghan mujahedeen have made their way to 
Kashmir to fight alongside local Moslems in what they consider a 
"jihad," or holy war. 
  "Militants from 46 Moslem countries have come to Kashmir to 
help us ... There is no problem in recruiting boys these days," 
said Jehangir, who figures near the top of the army's 
most-wanted list and who served three years in prison for 
secessionist activities before rising to the number two post in 
the Hezbul Mojahedin. 
  There are dozens of militant organizations operating in the 
Moslem-majority Kashmir Valley but they are split between those 
favoring independence and those seeking a merger with Pakistan. 
  Clashes between factions are common and have left nearly 400 
people dead during the past three years, according to the Indian 
authorities. 
  Yasin Malik, leader of the pro-independence Jammu and 
Kashmir 
Liberation Front, the Hezbul Mojahedin's chief rival for 
popularity, has accused the pro-Pakistan group of targeting him 
on two occasions this month. 
  Jehangir denied the charge, and played down the importance 
of 
rifts between the groups. "This is guerrilla warfare and the 
more outfits there are, the more attacks there will be against 
the enemy," he said. 
  He said his organization was open to a proposal by Malik to 
merge the various outfits into two major groups -- those 
favouring independence and those favoring a merger with Pakistan. 
  "If other militant groups agree to his proposal than we will 
also accept it," he said. 
  India has poured tens of thousands of troops into Kashmir in 
a bid to crush the Moslem insurgency, which it charges is fueled 
by arms supplied by Pakistan. 
  It has consistently rejected Kashmiri Moslem demands to hold 
a plebiscite to decide whether to remain part of India or to 
join neighbouring Pakistan, which also claims the Himalayan 
territory. 
  Nearly 10,000 people have lost their lives in Kashmir since 
1989, and the violence has left its tourism-driven economy in 
ruins.

  [Text] Jeddah, June 15 (MAP) -- Morocco will maintain its 
boycott of the meetings of the Organisation of African Unity 
(OAU) as long as the `Polisario' [Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] continues to seat 
[as received] there, said Ahmed Bensouda, adviser to King Hassan 
II of Morocco. 
  In a statement published Tuesday by Saudi daily `UKAZ', 
Bensouda said Morocco did not attend any OAU meeting since the 
admission of the 'Polisario' and is still upholding its stands. 
The so-called Polisario is bustling to hamper the holding of 
the referendum in the Moroccan Sahara and wants a referendum 
that fits its interests, said Bensouda recalling that several 
members of the `Polisario' had joined Morocco, for they know 
that the Sahara is Moroccan. 
  On Morocco's relations with Arab countries, Ahmed Bensouda 
said King Hassan II is endeavoring along with Arab heads of 
state to clear up the Arab atmosphere and preserve Arab 
resources and capacities.

  [Text] Tunis, AL-ANWAR--Arab diplomatic sources close to 
the Palestinian-U.S. meetings--Yasir 'Arafat's meetings with 
Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Middle 
Eastern affairs, last month and with U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia 
John McCarthy the day before yesterday--disclosed that 'Arafat 
raised several issues with Pelletreau and again with Ambassador 
McCarthy. 
  Those issues include the slowdown in the receipt of funds 
necessary to run the self-rule mechanism and the fate of the 
Palestinian residents in Lebanon and Syria, since they are not 
allowed to return under the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which closes 
the door to the return of the refugees from 1948. Most 
Palestinians residing in Syria and Lebanon are refugees from 
1948. 
  According to close diplomatic sources, 'Arafat expressed a 
wish for the Palestinians in Lebanon to be granted citizenship 
and permanent resettlement there. 'Arafat said to Pelletreau: 
Do you have any other option? The U.S. official was silent 
before saying: "It is a proposal worthy of consideration."

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Europe correspondent Nitzan Horowitz] </F>
  [Text] Madrid -- Representatives of the EU and Japan, who 
yesterday opened the multilateral conference on economic affairs 
in Rabat, reported about contacts with Syria regarding proposals 
for projects initiated in the multilateral working group. 
Syria, which boycotts the multilateral talks, has evinced 
interest in the various proposals being discussed by experts in 
workshops and in regional meetings. 
  A senior Israeli source said that Syria's interest in the 
economic aspect of the multilateral talks is very great. He 
said the Syrians have evinced great interest in the proceedings 
of the work groups and are interested in being updated on this 
issue. The source assessed that "the economic sphere could be 
Syria's entrance gate into the multilateral process." 
  All the participants in the Rabat conference expressed the 
hope that Syria and Lebanon will join the economic work group. 
Some even said there is a feeling that a development in that 
direction may take place soon. It is assessed that Syria has 
reached the conclusion that the economic forum is the most 
practical forum in the multilateral process and that it could 
lead to rather tempting infrastructure and development projects. 
Consequently, as the Israeli source said, "the Syrians do not 
want to miss the train." 
  Economic sources claim that Syria is very well aware of the 
fact that the projects being discussed in the conference have 
far-reaching economic significance and harbor great potential 
for large-scale international financing and investments which 
Syria stands no chance of obtaining otherwise. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 0400 GMT on 16 June 
carries a recorded interview with Professor Ya'aqov Frenkel, the 
Bank of Israel Governor who co-heads the Israeli delegation to 
Rabat, in which Frenkel is asked about the Syrian interest in 
the proceedings. Frenkel is recorded as saying: "Today we have 
heard some reports by some delegations indicating that indeed 
from their impression of their bilateral dealings with the 
Syrians they gained the impression that indeed there might be 
some growing interest and a somewhat more positive attitude 
toward the committee. But I would emphasize very strongly that 
this was not part of any formal report, nor is there hard 
evidence. One talks about nuances and feelings, and that's 
basically where we are."] 
  [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 16 June carries 
an interview with Uri Savir, director general of the Foreign 
Ministry and the other co-head of the Israeli delegation to 
Rabat, in which, referring to the same issue, Savir is recorded 
as saying: "Based on various reports by the EU and Japan, it 
looks as though Syria is evincing some interest in this 
conference. Visits were paid to Syria by various elements, 
especially the EC, which has organized this conference. Syria 
is showing interest in the regional economic cooperation talks, 
which is perhaps the most significant work group in the 
multilateral talks. At this point, however, Syria has made no 
commitment to join the talks; this is reserved for a later 
stage." 
  [Asked about progress on the Israeli-Syrian track, Savir 
says: "It is hard for me to say, because it is difficult to 
guess exactly what stands behind this Syrian curiosity. Perhaps 
they believe that progress will be achieved in their bilateral 
talks with us, a thing they consider as a condition for joining 
the multilateral talks. It is also possible that there is 
something else here, namely, the more projects are being planned 
between us and the Arab countries the more difficult it becomes 
for any country to be left out of the picture." Savir adds: "I 
assume Syria realizes that joining this framework will not 
contribute to the peace process only, but to the Syrian economy 
as well."]

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has appealed to the 
religious scholars and believers in different schools of thought 
to maintain utmost discipline and caution and foil the nefarious 
designs of inimical forces by observing Muharramul Haram [holy 
month of Muharram] in a peaceful and orderly manner. 
  She was addressing the 14th annual Hussainia Conference in 
Islambad today. The prime minister said the government has 
undeniable proof of a conspiracy hatched by an inimical 
neighboring country to inject or hire citizens or some saboteurs 
so as to create law and order problems by airing harsh sectarian 
feelings [sentence as heard]. The government is alive and alert 
to its duties and would take firm measures to maintaining smooth 
law and order. She said the chief ministers of the provinces 
have already been directed to adopt stringent steps in this 
regard. In its bid to cow down Pakistan to desist from venting 
a principled moral and diplomatic support to the consensus 
Kashmir cause [as heard], the neighboring country has hatched 
conspiracies one after the other to create internal problems for 
Pakistan. The prime minister said with the help and support of 
the people and by making use of all machinery at its command the 
government would frustrate such nefarious designs.

<F P=106> [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Belhadj Attacks Zeroual and </F>
Accuses Him of `Falsifying and Distorting Facts'"] 
  [Excerpts] London -- The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] has 
distributed the text of a letter sent by Cheikh Ali Belhadj from 
his prison in Blida to President Liamine Zeroual accusing him of 
breaking an agreement and of "distortion of facts, 
falsification, and fabrication." He was replying to a statement 
made by Zeroual over two months ago charging that FIS did not 
honor its promise to stop the violence. [passage omitted] 
  An informed Algerian source has told AL-HAYAH that the 
Algerian crisis "has reached a security and political climax," 
and that the number of people killed in the ranks of the 
Islamists and government forces "has reached 100 daily, and the 
poor channels of contact and dialogue which raised some hopes 
over the past six months have been closed." 
  The same source spoke of a meeting held between a former 
Algerian official, Islamist leaderships interested in Algerian 
affairs, and the FIS leadership abroad. He said that the 
meeting concluded that "the invisible [Algerian] leadership 
which toppled President Bendjedid and revoked the elections won 
by the FIS is the very same leadership which brought Zeroual to 
power, and that the escalation of violence against FIS 
supporters is done with the knowledge of that leadership and in 
accordance with its plans." The Algerian official disclosed to 
the FIS leadership "details of armed groups manipulated by 
security organs headed by Major General Mohamed Lemari who is 
continuing his work despite the recent changes in the Algerian 
Army." The source downplayed the French role which he described 
as "existent but not serious. Algeria is not Gabon and many 
things take place without Paris' approval." He emphasized that 
the all-out confrontation, the large-scale security operations, 
the summary executions, and reprisals against families of the 
mujahidin "all take place in accordance with a decision by the 
real command within the Army." [passage omitted] 
  Sources close to the FIS say that it is currently trying to 
unite its military ranks and intensify its political campaign. 
At the beginning of the current month it announced the 
formation of the Military Committee for the West [al-lajnah 
al-'askariyah lilgharb] and described that move as a 
"structuring of the FIS' military wing." This is the first time 
FIS has admitted the existence of its military wing. "It seems 
to be trying to block the way for the independent groups, 
especially the armed Islamic groups trying to inherit FIS' 
leading position in Algeria on the grounds that the FIS is a 
political party and has no military activity." [passage omitted]

  [Text] Ankara, June 14 (AFP) -- The Patriotic Union of 
Kurdistan (PUK) blamed rival Kurd leaders for the "massacre" of 
mourners at a slain rival's funeral in northern Iraq, in a 
statement received by AFP here on Thursday. 
  The rival Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had said PUK 
gunmen shot dead 51 people and wounded 40 more at the funeral of 
'Uthman Qadir Munawwar, a KDP leader, in the town of 
al-Sulaymaniyeh on Monday. 
  But the PUK charged Thursday that the KDP was to blame for 
the slaughter, saying it had been "determined to exploit the 
funeral to destabilise the situation in the town." 
  The PUK statement said two grenades were thrown in the 
direction of PUK fighters and mourners at Munawwar's funeral, 
provoking an exchange of gunfire between the rival factions 
which killed 14 people and wounded 46 more. 
  An initial toll from a UN source Monday had said seven 
people 
were killed and 47 wounded. 
  Munawwar was killed near the Iranian border during fighting 
between the KDP and the PUK, which have been locked in a violent 
power struggle since early last month. 
  The KDP said in a statement Tuesday that PUK fighters shot 
"without any warning," and that women and children were among 
the victims. 
  It said it was "shocked by this appalling massacre" in al- 
Sulaymaniyeh, a PUK stronghold. 
  The PUK called for "the immediate launch of an independent 
inquiry into this tragedy to bring those responsible to justice." 
  The shooting took place on the same day as the rival KDP and 
PUK leaders, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani respectively, met 
in the Turkish border town of Silopi to discuss ways to end the 
fighting. 
  About 100 people have been killed in the PUK-KDP showdown in 
northern Iraq, which is controlled by Kurds with the backing of 
a US-lead coalition and in defiance of Baghdad, according to 
independent sources. 
  The Iraqi opposition has said the fighting claimed more than 
600 lives.

  [Text] Baghdad, 16 Jun (TANJUG) -- Iraq and Yugoslavia 
today expressed their commitment -- during the hardships 
currently faced by both countries -- to finding mutually useful 
solutions for problems in their current cooperation and its 
development, when the conditions for it are ripe. 
  This is a brief summary of the talks held in Baghdad this 
afternoon between Milorad Unkovic, minister of the Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia for economic relations with foreign 
countries and Iraqi Trade Minister Muhammad Mahdi Salih. This 
meeting opened a several-day-long session of a joint 
Yugoslav-Iraqi committee for economic and technical development. 
  The aim of the session is to review the cooperation so far 
and establish the total outstanding claims of Yugoslav companies 
in Iraq. 
  In addition to the federal Yugoslav minister, the talks are 
being attended by FRY Deputy Foreign Minister Radoslav Bulajic, 
and Jovan Kostic, the charge d'affaires of the FRY Embassy in 
Baghdad, as well as a group of directors of large Yugoslav 
companies whose firms have carried out work in Iraq. 
  The Yugoslav delegation is expected to hold talks with 
senior 
Iraqi economic and state leaders over the next few days.

  [Text] Baghdad, 17 Jun (INA)--An Iraqi newspaper has 
asserted that the new Saudi military buildup on the Yemeni 
border is no surprise for those who have been following the 
Saudi regime's policy and planned roles, which basically aim to 
destroy all constituents of the Arab nation's strength and unity. 
  In an article today, AL-THAWRAH adds: This buildup is 
another link in an aggressive conspiratorial chain. Saudi 
Arabia has already implemented links in this chain by expelling 
more than half a million Yemeni workers from Saudi Arabia. It 
was also behind most of the assassinations and disturbances that 
took place in Yemen following Yemeni unity. Moreover, the Fahd 
regime refrained from addressing the border problem with Yemen. 
Afterward, the most obvious link became clear with the arms and 
financial support that Saudi Arabia provided to the 
secessionists, in addition to the Saudi political and diplomatic 
moves in this regard. 
  AL-THAWRAH points out that the Saudi policy against Yemen is 
part of an imperialist-Zionist conspiracy designed to fragment 
the Arab homeland. This policy complements the 30-state 
aggression on Iraq, exploiting the regional and international 
situation created as a result of this aggression. 
  The paper wonders: Would the agent Fahd's regime dare to 
undermine Yemen's unity and harm the Yemeni people if the Arab 
situation were different, a situation that resulted from the 
wounds the Arabs caused to Iraq and from their unjust embargo 
imposed on it? 
  The paper also wonders: Would this regime be able to do what 
it pleases and rally the positions of the traitors, agents, 
hirelings, and renegades against Yemen's unity if there were 
sound logic governing the concept of Arab solidarity? It adds: 
The policy of agentry, treason, and aggression, which has 
blindfolded the Saudi rulers, must eventually lead them to a 
terrible end. This is because the power they are relying on is 
not their intrinsic power in the first place; they are only 
implementing an imperialist scheme. One who relies on a 
foreigner cannot be safe in the long run. 
  AL-THAWRAH adds: The political opportunity that has pushed 
the Fahd regime toward both recklessness and brandishing force 
against all that is a genuine Arab is actually a transient 
opportunity. The Saudi rulers should learn a lesson from Iraq's 
steadfastness and from Yemeni unity, knowing that the need for 
this unity was unanimously emphasized by the Yemeni people. 
These rulers should also learn from what is taking place inside 
Saudi Arabia itself where decay, scandals, and collapse are 
spreading.

<F P=106> [Article by Abu-Sirhan: "In The Name Of God, The Merciful, </F>
The Compassionate. As to the Thief, Male or Female, Cut Off His 
or Her Hands, a Punishment by Way of Example, From God, for 
Their Crime." (part of a Koranic verse)] 
  [Text] Revolution Command Council Decree No. 59 of 4 June 
1994 is a sound one. Theft cannot be deemed an ordinary crime 
when people are suffering under the circumstances of the 
embargo, where people labor endlessly to make ends meet and 
ensure themselves a decent livelihood. Under such 
circumstances, when one loses some of his material possessions, 
his budget is monstrously undermined. 
  This decree is directly connected with the principle of 
imposing the rule of law. I previously wrote an article, hoping 
that the decree we had to revoke prior to the onset of the 
30-state aggression due to Western pressure over the issue of 
human rights would be rehabilitated. This decree gave men the 
right to kill their sisters, wives, etc., if they commit 
adultery, or any other crimes of passion. The basic reasons for 
cutting off thieves' hands are also found in the injunction that 
calls for killing adulteresses. 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. "The 
woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication, flog each 
of them with a hundred stripes: Let not compassion move you in 
their case, in a matter prescribed by God, if ye believe in God 
and the Last Day." [Part of a Koranic verse] 
  This decree concerning adultery reflected our age-old Iraqi 
family traditions, which make us as Iraqis stand out among our 
brethren in the remaining Arab states. 
  In my opinion, the important thing is to see the competent 
agencies stringently implement the decree pertaining to thieves. 
This is necessary if that decree is to achieve its purposes and 
sublime objectives. This is because the failure to do so will 
cause immense damage and harm. 
  In the past, a decree providing for the execution of brothel 
madams was issued. This decree was one of the greatest and most 
profound ones, although it is hard to use the superlative case 
in such situations. 
  Nonetheless, I would like to address the following question 
to the competent agencies: How many brothel madams have been 
executed so far? 
  We, as journalists and informed people, have not heard that 
any single brothel madam has been executed, although there are 
many of them around.

<F P=106> [Unsigned article in the "Above the Red Line" column: </F>
"Wahhabism--Call of the Devil"] 
  [Text] Mr. 'Udayy Saddam Husayn has received a letter from 
the citizen T.S.D. [as published] explaining the threat posed by 
the appearance in the country of the Wahhabist movement, which 
receives direct support from the Saudi regime. In view of this 
important issue, we publish the contents of the letter: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. 
  Esteemed Mr. 'Udayy Saddam Husayn, may God's blessings and 
peace be upon you. Greetings of pride and appreciation. 
  You can readily imagine, dear sir, our predicament because 
of 
the problem which is facing our youth and even the elderly--a 
problem which is represented by the Wahhabist movement and its 
revival by the so-called Muhammad Nasir-al-Din al-Albani. We 
have known the real nature of the Wahhabist movement since we 
were children. This knowledge has been confirmed in our mind by 
articles and television reports and by the agent Saudi regime's 
position toward Iraq and the Iraqi people and leader. Indeed we 
were not deceived by this regime's attempts to befriend our 
revolution during the Iranian aggression against our struggling 
country. We are well aware of the reasons and naturally you are 
more capable of knowing them. Our apprehensions toward this 
dangerous movement cannot escape a brilliant person of your 
caliber. Following are the reasons for our apprehensions: 
  1. The Wahhabist-Albanian movement in its flagrant present 
form began with the 30-state war of aggression against Iraq. 
  2. The movement gives money to its members, most of them 
idle, and they are squandering the money left and right. 
  3. All the elements of the agent al-Da'wah [Islamic Call] 
Party and their sympathizers have become basic pillars of this 
movement, which is forming an unbelievable focus of attraction 
to them. Is it possible, dear sir, to see an individual with 
Persian origin and beliefs, renouncing the religious tenets 
which he has long held to be very sacred in order to become an 
extremist Wahhabi overnight? 
  4. Writings of the so-called Muhammad Nasir-al-Din al-Albani 
are widespread in Iraq. The revivalist of the Wahhabi movement 
is donning the clothes of a man of religion but he belongs in 
the category of the founders of the Kadianism [Ahmadiyah sect], 
Babism, Bahaism, and other destructive religious movements which 
endeavor to realize their aim by employing weird methods and 
attacking Islamic figures such as our prophet and lord Muhammad, 
God's blessings and peace upon him. 
  5. They are trying to instigate seditions, confusion and 
disturbances in mosques in defense of their aims and to promote 
their heresies, and are active in theological colleges in 
general. 
  6. Most religious scientists do not dare to confront them 
for fear of their reprisals which could end in killing. Some 
are bribed to remain silent under the guise of assistance. This 
helps their movement expand and influence increase. 
  7. They are mingling with naive youths in a suspicious 
manner and nobody is confronting them. 
  8. They are surprisingly identical in their apparel as well 
as in their movements at prayer and their beliefs. They are 
carbon copies of one another. How could they realize such 
harmony and how could they reach this unity in conduct, 
behavior, and belief? Is this merely a religious belief? We 
have been praying and worshipping for hundreds of years but we 
belong to different sects. Does not this show that their center 
of guidance is one? This proves that all the instructions are 
received from a guidance center of a political movement abroad. 
It is no use saying that this is a chance agreement, that all 
of them reached a correct course of worship. We have never 
experienced this in Iraqi mosques or in other mosques in any 
Arab country. 
  9. They have a common grudge against Iraq and are happy for 
the blockade and harm done against it. Your excellency is aware 
of the reasons. One such reason is that because of the blockade 
circumstances, a 100-dollar note can be changed into thousands 
of dinars. This is part of the assistance they are getting. We 
have heard of this assistance but did not see it although it is 
very logical and reasonable. They also hate the revolutionary 
regime in Iraq and that is why they smile and express happiness 
when they hear that the blockade has been extended or that the 
al-Rashid Hotel for instance has been bombed. 
  We do not want to take a long time explaining but these are 
only some of the legitimate questions that we would like to ask. 
We think that the party and security organs do not seem to be 
aware of this Wahhabist-Albanian activities. This also applies 
to the official and religious organs. Does this mean consent? 
If this is so then let the issue come into the open and let us 
all join this movement whose Albanian founder chose Jordan to be 
his headquarters and to facilitate his contacts with Iraq and to 
influence the Iraqis. If the opposite is true--and we are 
certain that this is so because we believe in God and in the 
principles of the Ba'thists and the intelligent Iraqi 
people--then let us put things in order and prevent this cancer 
from spreading before it is too late. 
  Sir, we have asked your help. Our only interest is our love 
for Iraq, the care for Islam, and allegiance to the Ba'th and 
Iraq. We are certain that the other offices of the state lack 
the daring, youthful, and revolutionary vision; that they rely 
on red tape, nepotism, and personal and tribal factors; and that 
at best the issue would be delegated to a committee and we do 
not know when the result would emerge. We are putting these 
questions before you and we are confident that your 
responsibility toward the youth and the Iraqis, in view of your 
high position in addition to the revolutionary characteristics 
that we know you possess, make us hopeful of getting decisive 
answers. We would like to remind your excellency that many 
sincere people frequent the mosques and we hope that others will 
not be punished for the sins committed by some. 
  May God grant you success in the service of the great Iraq 
and its people. May God's peace and blessings be upon you. 
  Observation: We have information on the centers and places 
where the Wahhabist are staying. If the security organs so 
require, we can supply the necessary information.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu </F>
by Hayim Zissowitz; place not given -- live] 
  [Excerpt] [Zissowitz] We called you this morning to 
discuss the possible establishment of a coalition by the Likud 
and Hayim Ramon's faction in the Histadrut labor federation, but 
we obviously cannot ignore the news of your meeting with 
Jordan's Crown Prince Hasan in London in May. 
  [Netanyahu] Why not? We definitely can. I have nothing to 
say about that. 
  [Zissowitz] Did you meet? 
  [Netanyahu] To repeat, I have no intention of getting into a 
discussion of this issue. I thought you called me to ask me 
about other things. 
  [Zissowitz] I began by saying that we wanted to discuss 
other matters with you, but that we could not ignore this piece 
of news which was first reported last night. I believe you have 
not categorically denied it. 
  [Netanyahu] I can only tell you one thing: I think the 
attempt made by certain elements in the last two years to 
portray the Likud as the enemy of peace -- as opposed to the 
supporters of peace -- has been futile. After all, it was the 
Likud that brought about the two big steps: the Camp David 
accords with Egypt and the Madrid conference on direct peace 
talks with all our neighbors. The Likud adheres to its concept 
that the attainment of a genuine peace must be based on security 
and our ability to protect this peace with arrangements that 
will prevent its disintegration and its deterioration into a new 
war. The Likud proved this ability and continues to adhere to 
this concept, whether it is in the government or in the 
opposition, and will continue to do so when I am once again in 
the government. 
  [Zissowitz] Not everybody in the Likud sees eye to eye with 
you on this issue. Last time when you voiced your support for 
contacts with Jordan and Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meeting 
with King Husayn, former Prime Minister Yitzhaq Shamir lashed 
out at you and asked you on what basis you were making such 
declarations. 
  [Netanyahu] I will not comment on such speculations and 
utterances. I can only tell you that Yitzhaq Shamir, just like 
many other members of the Likud -- its overwhelming majority, if 
not all of it -- firmly and clearly support the attainment of a 
peace agreement with Jordan. I have always said this would be 
one of our objectives. That is why we went to the Madrid 
conference and why the Likud government conducted negotiations 
with Jordan. This was and remains our objective. 
  [Zissowitz] Do you still adhere to your declaration about 
Jordan -- East Palestine [previous three words in English]? 
  [Netanyahu] I have always said and continue to say today 
that the solution of the question of Eretz Yisra'el and the 
status of the Palestinian Arabs between us and the Arabs will be 
found through two, not three, countries. Such a solution will 
be attained by the Jewish state in western Eretz Yisra'el -- the 
State of Israel -- and the Arab country with a Palestinian 
majority located on the eastern part of Mandatory Palestine -- 
the state of Jordan. We could reach a stable arrangement in 
negotiations with Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs; not the 
arrangement which is now disintegrating before our very eyes in 
Gaza and Jericho, but a different one. Negotiations with these 
two elements -- the state of Jordan and the Palestinian Arabs -- 
would enable us to arrive at an autonomy arrangement rather than 
at a state. 
  [Zissowitz] I suppose you were asked by your interlocutors 
-- or your interlocutor, if the reported meeting indeed took 
place -- whether as part of the understandings with Jordan you 
would be prepared to arrive at a territorial compromise with it, 
not with the Palestinian Arabs. 
  [Netanyahu] I suggest you do not make any suppositions. To 
repeat, I will not comment on those reports. I suggest that we 
stick to what I have just said. 
  [Zissowitz] But would you be prepared in principle? 
  [Netanyahu] I reiterate: It is our position that the 
territory west of the Jordan River should remain under Israel's 
sovereignty and our security domination. However, contrary to 
the situation that has existed since the Six-Day War, we aspire 
to revert from a military regime to a civilian government, to 
autonomy for the Arabs and security for the Jews. This concept 
has not changed. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Over the past six months, Israel has been involved 
in solving local crises in foreign countries. Israelis are 
currently in a CIS country on a mediation mission. Several 
months ago, Israelis were engaged in a similar mission in 
another country. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen 
reports on this new Israeli involvement: 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen] In Jerusalem today, the widow of 
late Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst was given the 
peace award. Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, the man who 
conceived the Oslo track, today discussed a new reputation 
Israel has been gaining: selling peace. 
  [Beilin] Two countries approached us after the Oslo 
agreement and asked if we at the Foreign Ministry would be 
willing to help them handle problems within their boundaries 
involving disputes between the government and a violent 
opposition element. In both cases, we were willing to offer our 
good services. We were even glad to do it. 
  [Rosen] Beilin would not name the countries in question. 
This activity is taking place under a thick veil of secrecy, 
and even the Prime Minister's Office is not familiar with all 
the details. We have learned that one of the countries is in 
Latin America. The other is in Europe, where these very days 
Israelis are shuttling back and forth in an attempt to mediate 
between two rival camps engaged in a bloody and violent 
struggle. So, after having been engaged in selling arms, are we 
now selling peace? 
  [Beilin] First, I am not certain that the gains are 
comparable. These services are given voluntarily. I certainly 
hope that in the future, Israel will be able to really help 
other places in the world that are involved in conflicts. 
  [Rosen] The deputy foreign minister also said today that he 
would support the participation of Israeli soldiers in UN 
peacekeeping forces. 
  [Beilin] I would not rule out the possibility that one day 
-- certainly after peace prevails here -- while we would still 
want to have a strong army of a considerable size, we could have 
units of volunteers who would be willing to serve in 
peacekeeping forces. [end recording]

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has notified PLO 
Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that the dialogue between them will go on 
in order to continue the implementation of the agreements 
between Israel and the PLO. Our political correspondent Gadi 
Sukenik has learned from sources in the PLO that this remark was 
made in a personal letter Rabin sent to 'Arafat yesterday 
morning. The letter was taken to Tunis by Jamil al-Tarifi. 
  The letter is warmly worded and in it, Rabin expresses his 
commitment to the peace process and to cooperation with 'Arafat. 
In the letter, Mr. Rabin also expresses a commitment to help 
the autonomy settle in, but it does not contain any financial 
commitment.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpts] Two days ago, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
instructed Major General Ilan Biran, commander of the Central 
Command, to reinforce the presence of IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] troops in the Jordan Valley, particularly in the 
vicinity of Jericho, in order to step up the security of the 
settlements in the area. [passage omitted] 
  A government source said that at Rabin's instructions the 
soldiers will help guard the settlements and prevent 
infiltrations. "If it is necessary, the soldiers will also give 
chase to infiltrators," the source added. [passage omitted] 
  There were several incidents in the territories yesterday. 
Two Palestinians were hit by rubber bullets in clashes with IDF 
troops in Hebron and Ramallah. Palestinian sources reported 
that shots were directed at an IDF base in the Ramallah area and 
that a firebomb was thrown at a police outpost in the city. The 
policemen opened fire at the perpetrator, but he escaped. 
Searches were launched in the area. Another firebomb was 
thrown in Nabulus, but no casualties or damages were caused in 
this incident either. 
  Palestinian sources in Dayr al-Balah reported several 
incidents of stone-throwing at Border Police and settlers' cars. 
Stone- throwing incidents also occurred in the Qatif Bloc and 
the vicinity of Kfar Darom. 
  A military source noted yesterday that wanted men persist in 
their efforts to hide in the autonomous areas of Gaza and 
Jericho. The IDF has reinforced its patrols along the main roads 
in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. 
  An evaluation report about the first month of activity of 
the 
joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols was issued yesterday. The 
report notes that no extraordinary events were registered during 
this period, except for a few shooting incidents. [passage 
omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Amnon Barzilay] </F>
  [Text] "Intelligence evaluation elements neutralized me in 
order to distance me from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. One of 
the methods they used was leaking a series of stories to the 
media while creating the impression in the prime minister's 
office that I was the source of those leaks." 
  These remarks were made last night by Dr. Jacques Neriya, 
prime minister's political adviser, who filed his resignation 
letter at the beginning of this week. Neriya further claimed 
that he knows who the senior source is behind the leak that he 
told the prime minister, in the presence of others, that Yasir 
'Arafat is crazy. 
  Neriya further said that the source's identity, protected by 
the censorship, said the following: "...unlike Neriya, who 
thinks that 'Arafat is crazy. Neriya should have read 'Arafat's 
psychological profile, written over a year ago, and should have 
realized that he is not crazy." 
  Neriya added: "The prime minister was fair enough not make 
any charges against me, but after I have been charged with so 
many affairs, I felt that he was keeping his distance, that he 
is reserved. They said that I am the current source of leaks 
from the prime minister's office." 
  Neriya said yesterday that he had never made the remarks 
attributed to him regarding the PLO head. On the contrary, he 
was in charge of drafting the psychological opinion prepared in 
the past about the PLO head. Dr. Neriya added that he decided 
to resign after 20 months of work when he realized that his 
skills as political adviser are not being properly used by the 
prime minister's bureau. 
  The fact that his status as political adviser was ignored 
has 
caused damage to the public image of the government and the 
prime minister over the past several weeks. Neriya claimed that 
the storm regarding Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' letter to 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst could have been 
prevented had he been consulted on this. 
  Neriya revealed that Police Minister Moshe Shahal, who has 
been acting as a liaison between the government and the Knesset 
since Hayim Ramon resigned, has systematically avoided using his 
services, for reasons unknown to Neriya. 
  "All the information regarding Peres' letter to Holst was 
presented to me. Had Shahal shown any interest and asked me 
about the letters to 'Arafat, I would have told him that 'Arafat 
had received a letter regarding the location of the Palestinian 
institutions in East Jerusalem. He could have then discussed 
the issue with the prime minister." 
  [Barzilay] Why did you not bring it to Shahal's attention? 
  [Neriya] Since Shahal was appointed liaison between the 
Knesset and the prime minister, he sent his aide to me once. 
Should I be running after Shahal? This is not my job. Ramon 
used to call me and come to my office whenever he needed 
information. [end Neriya] 
  Neriya claimed that the restrictions imposed on him, in his 
status as political adviser, grew gradually. "In the 
negotiations with the PLO, I was supposed to be an assistant to 
Major General Amnon Shahaq, the deputy chief of staff, as the 
representative of the prime minister. In fact, I was left out 
of the circle of consultations. I stayed on as a trouble 
shooter." 
  The next stage of his reclassification was when classified 
material stopped arriving at his desk, he said. "I felt like I 
was an outsider at the prime minister's bureau. They stopped 
passing information to me. How could I help forming political 
opinions?" 
  [Barzilay] Why did they neutralize you? 
  [Neriya] National evaluation elements were angry over the 
fact that the prime minister has a political, civilian arm that 
could draft political evaluations independently of them. [end 
Neriya] 
  In the coming days, Neriya will meet Hayim Ramon to work out 
the definition of his position as the person in charge of the 
Histadrut labor federation's international relations. Neriya 
claimed that he has never spoken to Ramon about his political 
plans or about getting him into the Knesset. 
  [Barzilay] Do you claim you were pushed aside in the bureau? 
  [Neriya] This is probably a matter of style. 
  [Barzilay] Were you the scapegoat of the system? 
  [Neriya] I was the lonely link. I have no organization. My 
only source of support was Director General Shim'on Sheves, and 
the prime minister's confidence in me. 
  [Barzilay] Do you believe the security branches are 
isolating the prime minister? 
  [Neriya] The thing is that they are almost the only element 
that controls information. 
  [Barzilay] Perhaps the prime minister is held captive by the 
system? 
  [Neriya] You are using the wrong word. The prime minister 
works vis-a-vis establishments -- the chief of staff, his 
deputy, the Mosad, the Shin Bet. I was an irregularity in that 
context. 
  [Barzilay] Would they not allow a civilian to work with the 
prime minister? 
  [Neriya] Yes, and in a place like this, if you have no 
information, you have no power. Preventing me from receiving 
information was aimed at neutralizing my influence on the prime 
minister. 
  [Barzilay] Did they harm the prime minister's ability to 
receive evaluations from you? 
  [Neriya] They first and foremost wanted to harm my 
functioning and allow the Army to have an exclusive status. How 
long can you fight? 
  [Barzilay] How do you feel about the prime minister? 
  [Neriya] I love him, I appreciate him, I admire him. I 
think he is a role model of integrity, openness, and dedication. 
I learned a lot from him. I was faithful to him. I believed in 
his path. I have no doubts about the things he did. 
  The problem is that I constantly had to fight for my square 
foot under the sun, to remind everyone that I exist, that I am 
here. I found I was an outsider. How long can you be an 
outsider? [end Neriya]

<F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "No Change in Main Portfolios; </F>
Jordan: Al-Majali's Cabinet Includes 10 Deputies"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman -- The cabinet of Prime Mininster 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali was reshuffled yesterday. Its political 
base was enlarged with the inclusion of 10 deputies from the 
main parliamentary blocs with the exception of the Islamic 
Action Front bloc. The main cabinet portfolios were not 
affected. 
  Official information shows that al-Majali kept the defense 
and foreign portfolios, and the ministers of finance, 
information, and industry kept their posts, which confirms 
continuation of the economic team with the exception of planning 
Minister Ziyad Fariz who has been replaced. 
  It was clear that there would be no change in the 
government's policy on the peace process, as the prime minister 
kept the foreign portfolio and Minister of State for Foreign 
Affairs Talal al-Hasan retained his. The appointment of Dhuqan 
al-Hindawi as deputy prime minister replacing Deputy Prime 
Ministers Ma'n Abu-Nuwar and Sa'id al-Tall indicates that 
al-Majali wants to entrust the internal affairs to al-Hindawi so 
that he could devote himself to the peace process which has 
witnessed some activity on the Jordanian-Israeli track in the 
past few days. 
  The cabinet reshuffle came one day after the announcement in 
Washington that some progress had been made in the 
Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on issues pertaining to the 
occupied Jordanian territory, the demarcation of international 
borders, water quotas, and economic cooperation, in addition to 
the announcement of a joint decision to move the negotiations on 
these topics to "the region" in July. 
  Observers see the cabinet reshuffle as a bid to rescue 
al-Majali's government which was heavily burdened with the 
increasing parliamentary opposition and criticism of its 
domestic and foreign policies. 
  Political circles are unanimous that the reshuffle will 
facilitate the work of the government which will be tackling the 
results of moving the negotiations to the region and the 
reactions and effects that will have on the Jordanian and 
Palestinian public opinions. 
  According to independent political sources, the reshuffle 
"reassures the Jordanian and Palestinian people" that there will 
be no change in the government's policy of commitment to 
proceeding with the peace negotiations in a way that would 
parallel the progress made on the Palestinian track. It should 
be noted that the appointment of Talal 'Urayqat, Crown Prince 
Hasan's private secretary, as energy minister has been seen as 
an example of that trend. 'Urayqat comes from the village of 
Abu-Days in the suburbs of Jerusalem, the same place which 
Palestinian official Sa'ib 'Urayqat and negotiator Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-al-'Ala') hail from. [passage omitted]

  [Text] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the regent, has 
stressed that we are facing a new challenge in the peace 
process. In a speech he delivered at the Royal War College, his 
highness added that peace in the Middle East figures high on the 
international agenda. He said Jordan has always been a peace 
advocate, and that Jordan's peace theory is not just theoretical 
propaganda, but an essential practical reality. 
  In his the lecture, his highness reviewed the challenges 
facing the Arab nation under changing world circumstances. His 
highness said the world's interests have become intertwined. 
Therefore, small states have lost a great degree of their 
freedom, and their decisions are affected by the international 
axis more than by regional and domestic axes. He indicated that 
the continued Arab-Israeli conflict threatens cruel 
international disputes. 
  [Begin Hasan recording] We want a peace that preserves our 
historical and religious rights in the holy land and holy 
Jerusalem. Peace should not be a bargain of material profits at 
the expense of moral and spiritual sublimeness. Any peace that 
does not secure our rights cannot be a durable peace. For peace 
not to be fragile, we want peace for all Arab parties. Peace is 
indivisible. A just peace is a comprehensive peace on all 
fronts. We are not raising this as a slogan, but as a message 
that this is the only possible peace whose hopes and pains we 
can cope with. For us in Jordan, the requirements of peace are 
unchangeable. They will require us to face the burdens of peace 
with internal cohesion, comprehensive security, building a 
production base, and resolving the shortage in basic supplies, 
such as water, energy, and food. [end recording] 
  Present to listen to the lecture were Acting Prime Minister 
Dhuqan al-Hindawi, advisers to his majesty the king, the 
information minister, his highness the prince's special adviser, 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the chief of staff of the 
Royal Ground Forces, aides to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, and senior Armed Forces officers.

<F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Syria Criticizes Washington </F>
for Supplying Israel With Arms"] 
  [Text] Damascus, Cairo, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed 
Arab sources in Cairo have said that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher intends to send Ambassador Dennis Ross, U.S. 
general coordinator of the bilateral negotiations, to the Middle 
East before the end of the month to make shuttle trips between 
Damascus and Tel Aviv before Christopher's new tour, which is 
expected to begin in July. 
  The sources said that Dennis Ross will carry with him new 
Israeli proposals regarding the negotiations on the 
Syrian-Israeli track and an amendment to the Israeli plan on 
withdrawal from "Majdal Shams First" so as to include in the 
first phase a withdrawal from five villages on the Golan 
Heights, then diplomatic relations would be established between 
Syria and Tel Aviv. 
  The sources said that Syria has told the U.S. Administration 
that the guarantees offered to it so far under the Israeli plan 
are insufficient and conflict with the basic principles of the 
bilateral negotiations and the need for Israel's commitment to a 
full withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the implementation of 
the land for peace principle, and that security guarantees 
concern not only Israel, but all the parties concerned. 
  The sources pointed out that the U.S. administration is 
seeking to get Syria to agree to resume bilateral negotiations 
on the Syrian-Israeli track, especially after Jordan's agreement 
to resume negotiations on the Jordanian-Israeli track. 
  In the context of a new tour of the region for U.S. 
Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher in a new bid to revive peace 
opportunities between Syria and Israel, Syria has expressed its 
indignation at the Israeli position and the Rabin government's 
continued refusal to withdraw, which, in the Syrian officials' 
view, freezes the peace process and keeps it at a standstill. 
  A Syrian official told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday that what 
Rabin said, namely that there has been nothing new with regard 
to the talks with Syria and the existence of huge gaps between 
the Syrian and Israeli positions on the peace process, is 
attributable to the fact that the Rabin government continues to 
deal with the basis of the peace process from the angle of 
retaining the Golan and not withdrawing fully from the occupied 
Arab territories, thus exposing itself as a party that has no 
desire for a just and comprehensive peace. Meanwhile the Syrian 
position is fully responsive to the requirements of peace and to 
all the political efforts being made to achieve it on the basis 
of just and comprehensive foundations. Syria proceeds from its 
eagerness to achieve a secure and lasting peace that cannot be 
shaken by storms. 
  The Syrian official said that, if Israel is really and 
seriously seeking peace, all it has to do is to withdraw fully 
from the Arab territories, implement the resolutions of 
international legitimacy in order to achieve peace in the 
region, and stop -- it and its leader -- swimming against the 
tide. 
  Meanwhile a Syrian military official has told AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT that Israeli armament is a threat to the region's 
security and stability. And that Israeli military thinking -- 
regardless of the costs -- is working to make Israel a military 
state. It is not interested in peace. It is interested in war 
and in expanding the aggression. The source said that Israel is 
in the forefront of the states receiving arms, and it is the 
most prominent with regard to the purchase of various types of 
military equipment, despite what is being said about control of 
the arms race in the region. 
  The military official criticized states that supply Israel 
with arms while they continue to talk about peace endeavors and 
efforts. He said that when the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which 
the United States believes is within the framework of peace, was 
being signed, Israel was supplied -- by airlift -- with 24 
Apaches. They were supplied under U.S. military aid. These 
helicopters are among the best in the world. A squadron of 
these helicopters took part recently in shelling Lebanese 
resistance positions in Lebanon, causing great devastation. 
  Israel has also a group of pilotless planes like Harvey 
Searcher Falcon, Eagle-eye, Kurns-2000, and modified Hunter 
"Binar" [names as transliterated]. There is information 
confirming Israel's possession of a group of Patriot missiles, 
which were supplied to the Israeli Army during the Gulf war. 
  The Syrian military official added that the quantity and 
quality of the arms in Israel's possession and those which it is 
seeking to possess is not in line with the peace proposals and 
confirm that Israel does not want peace, but, rather, is 
preparing for war, as Washington continues to officially declare 
its eagerness to maintain Israel's military superiority over 
neighboring Arab states, safeguarding this superiority within 
the equations of military strategic balance and confronting the 
advanced weapons owned by some Arab states with weapons that are 
superior. 
  The official pointed out that this military superiority 
represents a real threat to peace in the region, and no peace 
can last where the military balances of power are disrupted.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In a commentary today, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH 
discusses the regional tour U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher will make soon in order to activate and promote the 
peace process since it has been stalled by Israel's intransigent 
policy. 
  AL-THAWRAH says: No doubt, the success of Christopher's new 
tour depends on the new things he carries. In other words, his 
tour depends on effecting the required change in the Israeli 
position on the peace process in a way that makes this position 
fully serious and committed to promoting this process and 
securing its objective in terms of a just and comprehensive 
peace. 
  The paper notes that the peace process is now facing a 
difficult impasse due to Israel's insistence on rejecting peace 
according to the bases set for it in both the Madrid formula and 
its international terms of reference, and also due to Israel's 
attempt to replace the principle of a comprehensive solution 
with separate deals and partial solutions that would enable 
Israel to perpetuate its occupation of the Arab territories. 
  AL-THAWRAH also notes the four regional tours that 
Christopher has made in one and a half years. None of these 
tours achieved its objective in terms of promoting the peace 
process and realizing the required breakthrough. The paper 
adds: The failure of the U.S. efforts is entirely due to Israel 
and its policy which rejects peace. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Thus, the pressing task for the 
U.S. secretary during his next tour is to address Israel with 
new language that is primarily based on tangible political and 
material pressures in a way that will force Israel comply with 
international legitimacy, respond to the U.S. efforts, and meet 
the peace requirements without delay or hesitation. 
  In another commentary on the same topic, AL-THAWRAH says: 
The success of the efforts by the head of U.S. diplomacy during 
his new mission depends primarily on the ideas and proposals 
that Secretary Christopher will carry and whether they promote 
the peace process and rectify its course according to the bases 
and terms of reference of the Madrid conference. Christopher's 
mission also depends on the possibility of changing the Israeli 
position, which is still far from the requirements and 
conditions of a just peace. 
  AL-THAWRAH urges the U.S. Administration to compel Israel, 
by 
all means of pressure, to comply with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and acknowledge the Arab territories 
and rights because this is only the road to peace.

  [Text] This morning, comrade 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, assistant 
secretary general of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, received 
Steven Day, chairman of the Council for the Advancement of 
Arab-British Understanding [CAABU], now visiting the Syrian Arab 
Republic at the invitation of the party's National Command. The 
two reviewed CAABU's activities in Britain in relation to Arab 
causes. Mr. Day stressed CAABU's support for the Arab demand 
that Israeli occupation of Arab territory be removed and 
legitimate Arab rights be recognized to promote a comprehensive 
and fair peace predicated on international legitimacy and UN 
resolutions. 
  The sides reviewed the state of coordination between CAABU 
and political organizations active in Arab states. 
  Comrade al-Ahmar laid out Arab issues and Israel's 
aggressive 
and terrorist practices against Arabs in the occupied 
territories and the obstacles it places in the path of the peace 
process in order to abort it. 
  Comrade al-Ahmar also reviewed Arab and world developments 
and the peace process, which, he emphasized, continues to 
flounder thanks to Israel's intransigence. He stressed that 
Syria is working for a fair and comprehensive peace settlement 
providing for the restitution of occupied territories and Arab 
rights. 
  Comrade al-Ahmar pointed to the role expected of Europe to 
make peace a reality. 
  For his part, Mr. Day paid tribute to the Syrian position on 
the peace process, indicating Syria's manifest international 
standing. He wished the Syrian people increased advancement and 
prosperity.

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 14 (AFP) -- King Birendra of Nepal 
has called for parliament to open its seventh session on June 29 
during which the future of Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala 
is likely to be decided. 
  In what observers said Tuesday is likely to be a stormy 
session, the ruling Nepali Congress (NC) will have to decide its 
differences, with the pro- and anti-Koirala camps still at 
loggerheads. 
  The prime minister is also expected to push for a change in 
party rules to allow him to hold two posts -- prime minister and 
party president -- which would give him control, they said. 
  Internal problems aside, the government also faces a renewed 
threat of public protests from the opposition Nepal Communist 
Party-ULited Marxist and Leninist. 
  Rebel NC MPs are also threatening to vote against an 
important financial bill unless Koirala resigns.

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 16 (AFP) -- Nepal's second largest 
parliamentary opposition party, the United Peoples Front (UPF), 
has split into two factions after a party official was expelled 
from a UPF committee, a party source said Thursday. 
  Six of the party's MPs pushed out UPF convenor Baburam 
Bhattarai from the committee he headed for using the party for 
personal gain, the source said. 
  The two new UPF factions have filed petitions to the Chief 
Election Commission Office seeking exclusive recognition for the 
next general elections in 1996.

  [Text] Kathmandu, June 8 (AFP) -- Nepal has announced new 
visa regulations with lower fees and longer periods of validity 
aimed at boosting the tourism industry with effect from July 16, 
an official source said Wednesday. 
  Under the new visa regulations, foreigners investing in 
Nepalese business and industry will be given five-year multiple 
entry visas. 
  The cost of ordinary tourist visas will drop to 15 dollars 
from the current rate of 20 dollars for a 15-day stay, which can 
be extended to 35 days for another 25 dollars, the official said. 
  Tourist group leaders and foreigners staying in Nepal for up 
to six months to conduct feasibility studies in industrial and 
trade activities will be given non-tourist visas, the official 
added. 
  Tourists arrivals to Nepal dropped to 293,567 in 1993 from 
334,353 the previous year. Tourist receipts fell to 61.09 
million dollars in 1993 from 72.10 million dollars.

  [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 17 (AFP) -- Clashes between 
Iranian-backed Hizballah guerrillas and allied Israeli 
militiamen killed a civilian woman and wounded four people in 
south Lebanon on Friday, police said. 
  The fighting broke out after Hizballah attacked an SLA 
outpost on the edge of Israel's self-declared "security zone" in 
south Lebanon with machine guns and B-7 rocket-propelled 
grenades, police in the southern port of Tyre said. 
  A group of guerrillas advanced close to the South Lebanese 
Army (SLA) outpost at al-Qantarah at mid-morning firing and as 
they pulled back the position came under a hail of mortar fire. 
  The SLA retaliated with a heavy artillery barrage on 
villages 
just north of the security zone, sending several shells crashing 
into civilian homes and killing a 50-year-old woman and wounding 
four other people, police added. 
  They fired more than 20 shells on the villages of Qabrikha, 
Tulin and Wadi al-Saluqi which face the al-Qantarah outpost and 
fires were reported in the region. 
  Two Israeli Cobra helicopters gunships also went into 
action, 
strafing a ravine used by the guerrillas to attack the security 
zone, police said. 
  On Thursday Israeli warplanes blasted a Hizballah base in 
the 
Iqlim al-Tuffah hills in south Lebanon. Two planes fired a 
missile at Mlita without causing any casualties. 
  Up to 45 guerrillas were killed on June 2 in an Israeli 
helicopter raid on a Hizballah training camp in the 
Syrian-controlled eastern Ba'labakk region. 
  Since then Israel has flown daily sorties over Lebanon 
searching to wipe out Hizballah resistance fighters.

  [Text] Beirut, 16 Jun (MENA)--Lebanese Foreign Minister 
Faris Buwayz revealed that the United States has conveyed to 
Lebanon the U.S. "clarifications" about what is happening on the 
Jordanian-Israeli track in which it stressed that Washington 
does not regard this action as a deviation from Madrid's Middle 
East peace conference mechanism but sees it as an aspect of it. 
He said that these clarifications emphasized that no agreement 
has been signed between the Jordanian and Israeli sides. 
  In a report he submitted to the Lebanese cabinet last night, 
Buwayz said that U.S. Ambassador in Lebanon Mark Hambley brought 
him these clarifications yesterday to have them conveyed to the 
Lebanese Government. 
  The Lebanese foreign minister expressed his belief that the 
Jordanians' objective from this action is to lift the U.S. siege 
on the Gulf of al-'Aqabah and to obtain an economic and 
financial share in the economic agreement between the PLO and 
Israel which is required by the Gaza-Jericho agreement on 
Palestinian self-rule. 
  President Ilyas al-Hirawi briefed the cabinet last night on 
the outcome of the Lebanese-Syrian summit talks that he held 
with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus the day before 
yesterday. 
  Informed sources said that al-Hirawi unveiled a 
Syrian-Lebanese agreement to draw up a joint action plan to face 
the U.S. pressure that the two countries are expecting to be 
exerted on them in the next few weeks following the recent 
developments in the Jordanian-Israeli track. 
  The sources added that al-Hirawi conveyed to al-Asad 
Lebanon's fears following reports that Syria and Israel might 
reach an agreement, leaving Lebanon to face Israel's political, 
security, and military pressures alone. They said that the 
Syrian president stressed to al-Hirawi that his country would 
not agree to peace and to withdrawal from the Golan before the 
fate of Lebanon's south and western al-Biqa' are decided. 
  Al-Hirawi also told the cabinet that al-Asad stressed to him 
Syria's readiness to approve the mechanism for the Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan within a period not to exceed six 
months after security and peace are achieved.

  [Text] According to new information on the attack on the 
Lebanese Consulate in Australia, unidentified persons threw 
gasoline and set fires around the consulate and at the entrance 
of the building. Australian firemen managed to extinguish the 
fire before it reached the inside of the building. Only the 
garage and the consul's car were damaged. 
  Diplomatic sources in Sidney said the consul had refused to 
sign forged documents which two fugitive suspects in the al-Zuq 
Church bombing and assassination of engineer Dany Sham'un, Tony 
'Ubayd and Jean Shahin tried to obtain. 
  The investigation links the fire to the indictment in 
connection with the two cases.

  [Text] House of Representatives Speaker Brother Shaykh 
'Abdallah al-Ahmar has reiterated that the approach the 
political leadership, the government, and the legislative 
council in the Republic of Yemen adopt to settle the current 
crisis is that of the Yemeni people. This approach is embodied 
in the fact that Yemeni unity is the fate and lot of the people, 
and that this unity should not be harmed and is not subject to 
bargaining. He said the state welcomes and does not reject 
dialogue with any party, if this dialogue deals with Yemeni 
unity, the establishment of this unity, and with legitimacy, 
democracy, and political pluralism. Those who reject this are 
infidels. 
  This came at a news conference by the brother House of 
Representatives speaker today and attended by local, Arab, and 
foreign correspondents in Sanaa. 
  House of Representatives Speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah 
Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar emphasized that the Armed Forces, the forces 
of unity and legitimacy are confronting the forces of apostasy 
and secession, and that the Yemeni people from all walks of life 
support their Armed Forces. He explained that the forces of 
apostasy and secession have imposed war on our people, something 
our people do not want. He said the secessionists cannot have 
some of their illusions realized because Yemeni unity is a fact, 
the fruit of the struggle of the Yemeni people, their response 
to the Yemeni revolution's objectives, and the nucleus of 
comprehensive Arab unity.

  [Text] Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, the deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council, this morning inspected the 
air force and air defense headquarters, where he was briefed on 
the battle operations and the role of the pilots in implementing 
their responsibilities of defending the homeland and its 
achievements, and of foiling the plans of the enemy on the 
various fronts. The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential 
Council praised the pilots' efforts to protect democratic 
Yemen's airspace, and to prevent the enemy forces from achieving 
their military aims. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri also visited the families of 
victims of the barbarous indiscriminate shelling suffered by a 
number of residential districts in the capital, Aden, which came 
from the forces of the military regime in Sanaa and resulted in 
the deaths and wounding of 30 women, children, elderly persons, 
and peaceful civilians. Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the 
deputy chairman of the Presidential Council, expressed his 
sorrow and condolences at these horrible massacres perpetrated 
against the peaceful residents of the capital, Aden. The 
brother chairman of the Presidential Council then visited the 
naval command, saw for himself the fighting morale of the naval 
officers and enlisted men, and observed their intrepid role in 
supporting their brothers in the Armed Forces in repulsing and 
defeating the invading forces.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, today visited the al-Yarmuk Forces camp. He 
was welcomed upon arrival by the brother officers, NCO's, and 
enlisted personnel. The brother leader met with them. They 
briefed him on their situation. He was also acquainted with the 
progress of the training, qualification, and instruction under 
way at the camp. 
  The army personnel affiliated with the al-Yarmuk Forces 
expressed their happiness with this visit by the brother leader 
president, which embodies his care for the Armed Forces 
personnel. This visit shows that he is interested in knowing 
about their concerns, and also that he loves them, the al-Yarmuk 
Forces personnel added. This concern by the brother president, 
they noted, will strengthen their resolve to perform their 
sacred nationalist duties. They reiterated their constant 
readiness to make dear sacrifices to vindicate the people's wish 
of safeguarding unity, defending the homeland's sovereignty and 
independence in the face of all challenges and dangers [words 
indistinct] along the path of faith in God, the homeland, the 
revolution, and unity, trust in [words indistinct] unity, and 
safeguarding all the gains and accomplishments the Yemeni people 
have achieved since the inception of the Yemeni revolutions of 
26 September and 14 October. 
  In their meeting with the brother leader, the al-Yarmuk 
Forces personnel reaffirmed that they will continue to do their 
utmost to realize the wishes of our people. They also said that 
they will continue their efforts to vindicate right and the 
homeland, unafraid of death and unreluctant to perform their 
duty under all circumstances, and regardless of the challenges 
entailed. They indicated that unity is the fate and destiny of 
our Yemeni people. They added that they will not abandon it 
regardless of the price and sacrifices entailed, because there 
can be no future for the Yemeni homeland without unity. They 
noted that the Armed Forces, which have always been in the 
forefront of the patriotic elements that vindicated the people's 
wishes with regard to the revolution and liberation from the 
[words indistinct], theocratic rule and colonial rule, are 
currently the hardened tool that is firmly confronting the 
conspiratorial schemes targeting Yemen and its unity, and 
aborting this secessionist plan engineered by the rebellious and 
separatist forces, which fuelled fighting and war in the 
homeland and sought to tear national unity apart and destroy the 
homeland in order to realize their selfish interests. 
  For his part, brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
addressed 
the officers, NCO's, and enlisted personnel of the al-Yarmuk 
Forces, hailing the heroic feats forged by our valiant Armed 
Forces in the battle to vindicate the people's wishes of 
safeguarding unity and democracy. He commended the [words 
indistinct] demonstrated by the al-Yarmuk Forces, who forged 
splendid feats of sacrifice. He indicated that our Armed 
Forces' performance has been irreproachable in their 
confrontation of the challenges the renegades rebelling against 
the homeland attempted to force on us with the aim of tearing 
the homeland apart. He added: But, thanks to God's will, the 
steadfastness of our people and their rallying around their 
Armed Forces, these criminal schemes targeting the homeland and 
its unity have been resisted. He noted the rebellious gang's 
criminal practices against our people in the valiant city of 
Aden, where various forms of torture and oppression are being 
perpetrated against citizens. Children and women are being 
forcibly extricated from their houses and made to bear arms 
[words indistinct] innocent citizens are being sent to the war 
fronts and used as human shields. He affirmed that these 
criminals will not go unpunished. They will receive the legal 
punishment they deserve for the crimes they are committing 
against the homeland and the people. He asserted that our Armed 
Forces have always been, and will always remain the homeland's 
impregnable shield that protects the homeland from all 
challenges and dangers. They are the conscientious guardians 
who will confront any tamperers who seek to sabotage the 
homeland's accomplishments, security, and stability. 
  In his speech, the brother president also reviewed the 
overall current developments on the national scene. He noted 
our country's reiteration of its commitment to UN Security 
Council Resolution 924. He also mentioned the various 
cease-fire gestures it made toward the rebels to halt Yemeni 
bloodshed, saying that five cease-fire initiatives were made. 
Nonetheless, the rebels violated the cease-fire every time, and 
continued their attacks against our Armed Forces, thus violating 
and disregarding the UN Security Council resolution in defiance 
of the wishes of the Yemeni people and the international 
community, as well. 
  President Salih reiterated that, by so doing, the criminal 
rebels seek to internationalize the Yemeni crisis, which is a 
domestic Yemeni affair. He added that the current fighting is a 
battle raging between the entire Yemeni people and a misled and 
isolated minority rebelling against constitutional legitimacy 
and the Yemeni people's will, which was expressed when the 
Republic of Yemen was proclaimed on 22 May 1990, when a public 
referendum endorsed the Constitution, and also when free and 
direct parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 1993. 
  The brother president added: Yemeni unity is embedded within 
the consciences of all Yemeni people. It is our fate and 
destiny, and our way to achieve a prosperous (?independence). 
Unity was achieved through a peaceful and democratic dialogue 
that went on for many long years. It was not achieved by force. 
It is the embodiment of the will of all Yemenis throughout the 
homeland. Our people have waged protracted struggles, and made 
dear and great sacrifices to achieve their unity on 22 May. He 
affirmed that there can be no going back on unity, and that 
fragmentation, regardless of any form or shape it might take, 
has become a thing of the past. Our people's struggle for unity 
has been baptized with blood and dear sacrifices. They will not 
agree to relive the tragedies, calamities, and nightmares of 
fragmentation once again. The close- knit Yemeni people have 
been brought together. The river of unity has overflown, 
producing abundance, affection, and prosperity for all sons of 
the Yemeni homeland. Those opposed to unity and the will of the 
people must flee this homeland, which will not accept within its 
ranks and under its skies any people other than unity- 
orientated people, who have faith in God, the homeland, the 
revolution, and unity; who support their people and homeland; 
who are loyal to their causes; and who reject all temptations 
that seek to undermine the homeland, its unity, its gains, and 
its accomplishments. 
  The brother leader president concluded by invoking God's 
mercy on the souls of the righteous martyrs of our people and 
their valiant Armed Forces, who have shed their blood to 
vindicate the homeland and allow the banners of unity to flutter 
in the skies of the entire Yemeni homeland. He indicated that 
their dear sacrifices will allow our people to build a more 
prosperous future for the homeland under the banners of unity 
and democracy.

<F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab: "Brahimi Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: </F>
Three Steps To Resolve Yemeni Crisis; They Begin With 
Cease-Fire"] 
  [Text] Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, 
has emphasized that the situation in Yemen is not easy. 
However, he said that both sides are aware that the situation 
is very serious and that the Yemenis could lose control of the 
situation if matters continue as they stand and if the war is 
not brought to an end quickly. 
  Brahimi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in Amman 
that the reality of the past four years has created very 
difficult conditions, and that the failure of the attempts to 
secure a solution over these years has made matters more 
difficult. 
  The international envoy defined three phases for his current 
mission: 
  First, the two parties must be convinced that the fighting 
will lead to nothing but ruin and destruction, and that its 
continuation would cause the Yemenis to lose control of the 
situation. 
  Second, after everyone reaches this conviction, they must be 
convinced that the solution lies in dialogue and that reaching 
an understanding through dialogue is the only way to resolve the 
Yemeni crisis. 
  Third, if the first two steps are achieved and the two sides 
sit at the negotiating table, certainly every party is going to 
bring its conditions with it...and we will talk about it then.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah, Hani Naqshabandi, Salih Qallab, </F>
and Hanan al-Badri: "Sanaa: Aden Is a Must, Even If the War 
Continues"] 
  [Excerpts] While Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN 
secretary general, continues to race against time to avert what 
he described as a big tragedy that would afflict Yemen if the 
fighting between northern and southern forces is not halted, 
Yemeni Defense Minister Colonel 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi has stated that 
Sanaa is determined to enter Aden. He also stressed that the 
leadership in the north is discussing how to storm the city 
without harming its residents. [passage omitted] 
  'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, member of the General People's 
Congress General Committee, has revealed that Sanaa has made 
contacts with Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders whom it 
described as moderate both before and after the war broke out. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-'Anasi listed the 
names of some of these leaders. They include Salim Salih 
Muhammad, the No. 2 in the YSP, and Dr. Yasir Sa'id Nu'man, 
chairman of the Central Committee secretariat. 
  Al-'Anasi said that Sanaa is offering concessions "from a 
strong position and for the sake of sparing Yemeni blood." He 
stressed that Sanaa's basic conditions still stand, especially 
with regard to incriminating the 16 people who declared and have 
perpetuated the secession, including YSP leader 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid and Prime Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas. 
  But 'Ali Salih 'Abbad Muqbil, member of the YSP Political 
Bureau and member of the Yemeni parliament speakership, has 
stressed that Sanaa knows that there are concessions it is going 
to make regarding these people. However, he ruled out the YSP's 
backtracking on the decision to secede. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Muqbil said that the 
appointment of northerners in the new Aden government confirms 
that the YSP does not rule out the possibility of returning to 
unity once again. 
  He said that the state proclaimed in the south is a 
preparation for a new state under unity. 
  He stressed that Sanaa tacitly agrees to the presence of 
international observers, but it fears that that might perpetuate 
the secession. [passage omitted]

  [Text] An official source has asserted that the rebellious 
and traitorous gang no longer has influence on foreign public 
opinion apart from its false wailing and spreading of fabricated 
reports on indiscriminate artillery and missile bombardment of 
residential areas in the valiant city of Aden. This gang also 
talks about victims among the innocent citizens after having 
used up its lies about the shelling of vital and economic 
installations. 
  The precise details of the situation are now known in Aden, 
whether regarding the acts of repression, killings, and 
persecution carried out by the rebellious gang and those who 
encroached upon legitimacy against innocent citizens in all 
areas and neighborhoods, or regarding the involvement of 
children and girls in acts from which men, soldiers, and 
officers, who are mortgaged and linked to the rebels, have fled 
after finding out the truth and having been overwhelmed by 
immense despair. 
  Likewise, the citizens' position is known toward these 
gangs, 
which are obsessed with blood and with creating catastrophes in 
order to terrorize and humiliate the citizens. Meanwhile, these 
gangs transferred their entire families from Aden by sea despite 
the will of the ships that arrived in the port of Aden to 
transfer foreigners from Aden. This fact is also well known by 
the steadfast and enduring citizens in Aden. 
  The source found it strange that some Arab media carried 
these reports along with old pictures and other repeated 
pictures that were not taken in Aden. These media were so 
hostile and reckless that they carried televised clips showing 
the dead and wounded from Sanaa, al-Rahidah, Zinjibar, and other 
cities as a result of the Scud missiles fired by the rebellious 
criminals. These media, however, claimed that these clips 
showed victims of the alleged indiscriminate shelling of 
residential areas in Aden. 
  Concluding his statement, the source asserted that this worn 
out card, which depends on lies and fabrication, will 
undoubtedly catch fire and turn into ashes, exactly like other 
cards. No doubt, lies are short-lived, he added.

  [Text] Statement and warning issued by the Aden Axis 
Command to the brother citizens in the city of Aden: 
  In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate. The 
Aden Axis Command warns and draws the attention of the brother 
citizens in Aden to avoid the following areas: Aden airport, 
Badr Camp, the naval forces berth, the radio and television 
buildings, the operations center in al-Sawwahi in the so-called 
Defense Ministry, the [Yemeni Socialist Party] Central Committee 
headquarters, al-Ma'ashiq area, and all the camps inside Aden, 
out of concern for the safety of all citizens and their precious 
lives. The forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy will 
have to deal with these positions and camps because the gang of 
rebellion against the constitutional legitimacy is not abiding 
by the cease-fire and continues to attack the positions and 
camps of the forces of unity and legitimacy. 
  The Aden Axis Command is confident that all honorable 
brother 
citizens in Aden will heed this appeal and warning and keep away 
from these positions and camps.

  [Text] Sanaa, 17 Jun (INA)--The Yemeni security forces have 
arrested a saboteur whom the Saudi authorities sent to carry out 
acts of sabotage in Yemen as part of the Saudi conspiracy 
against Yemeni unity and the Saudi support for the secessionists 
in southern Yemen. 
  An informed Yemeni security source told an Iraqi News Agency 
correspondent in Sanaa today that the security forces last night 
arrested one of the Saudi regime's agents after he blew up a 
house in the area of Bajil, approximately 50 km east of the 
eastern al-Hudaydah Governorate. 
  The source explained that the explosion killed one citizen 
and wounded seven others. He also revealed that the security 
authorities arrested three other saboteurs who confessed they 
were recruited by the Saudi authorities to carry out bombings in 
Yemen. They were arrested after their recent arrival from Saudi 
Arabia, he added.

  [Text] Vienna, June 16 (AFP) -- OPEC ministers failed to 
agree here Thursday [16 June] on the choice of a successor to 
OPEC Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia, delegates said. 
  Winding up a two-day meeting here, they agreed Libya's oil 
minister, 'Abdallah Salim al-Badri, should oversee the 
activities of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
secretariat until the next ministerial meeting in November, 
Saudi Arabia's oil minister Hisham Nazir said.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 16, IRNA -- Demands for oil across the 
world are expected to rise to 79 million barrels per day by the 
year 2010 from 65 million BPD at present, Iranian Ambassador to 
Japan Hosein Kazempur-Ardabili said Thursday [16 June]. 
  The member states of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries could meet more than 53 percent of the world's oil 
demands, he told IRNA. 
  The ambassador urged OPEC member states not to let political 
differences have adverse effect on their economic interests. 
  Kazempur, who has been nominated by Iran for the post of 
OPEC 
secretary general, said it would be regrettable to make any 
concession to buyers and let them buy this God-given gift at the 
lowest price just because of political differences. 
  He said the most important role that OPEC can play now was 
to 
prevent political differences among its members from having any 
adverse effects on their economic interests. 
  Kazempur felt confidence that by setting an oil output 
ceiling and taking into consideration the growing demands for 
oil, OPEC would soon witness considerable increase in the prices 
of oil provided that its members refrain from overproducing. 
  OPEC members are now meeting in Vienna to determine an oil 
production ceiling and elect OPEC's new secretary general.

  [Text] Bucharest, 16 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
has affirmed that using force to preserve the unity of Yemen 
will not succeed. 
  In an interview with Romanian television last night, 
President Mubarak expressed regret over what is happening in 
Yemen. 
  Answering a question on his attempt to mediate in the 
current 
conflict in Yemen, President Mubarak said: I tried to mediate 
and exchange viewpoints with the Yemeni president, but he told 
me one thing and did another. 
  In his interview with the Romanian television, President 
Mubarak added: I feel sorry about what is happening in Yemen. 
I discussed this subject with the Yemeni president many times. 
He insists on keeping his country united. But unity cannot be 
realized through force. The use of force to preserve unity will 
not succeed. 
  He said they are currently trying to impose unity on the 
south, but they will not succeed because there will be a great 
deal of bloodshed and many victims, which is a terrible thing. 
He noted that this does not guarantee any kind of unity; unity 
is based on the agreement and blessings of the two peoples. The 
will of the people must triumph, not the will of bombs, weapons, 
and bloodshed. Such situations do absolutely nothing to create 
unity. 
  On peace in the Middle East between Israel--an economically 
strong country--and the fledgling Palestinian state--which is 
practically starting from scratch--President Mubarak said that 
despite the fact that there are two countries with different 
growth rates, they are cooperating without any problems. In 
addition, the region is bursting with potential. 
  He added that there are many possibilities, but it is too 
soon to discuss these issues. We are currently concentrating on 
the peace process and the Palestinian, Syrian, Jordanian, and 
Lebanese issues. 
  He pointed out that when agreement with these countries is 
reached and applied, we will then think about and study ways and 
means of cooperation in the region. It is only natural for us 
to expect difficulties in the beginning; however, we cannot sit 
back and say that Israel is a strong country and the others are 
not. It is not right to succumb to this factor. 
  Answering a question about his view of the other aspects of 
the peace process, President Mubarak said in his interview that, 
on the whole, Jordan is not the one causing complications in the 
process. He said: I believe that Jordan is currently 
negotiating with Israel. I hope they will reach some agreement 
in the near future. 
  He added that with respect to Syria: I have repeatedly said 
that without the return of the Golan Heights to the Syrians, it 
is very difficult to think of the possibility of concluding a 
bilateral agreement. I have heard statements by Israeli 
officials to the effect that they will not budge an inch on the 
Golan Heights. True, such statements have not been made by 
Yitzhaq Rabin himself, but there are other officials who are 
making such statements. 
  Mubarak clarified that the problem between the Syrians and 
Israelis lies in the absence of mutual trust. I hope these 
obstacles will be overcome this year, he said. I also hope that 
some understanding can be reached over the Golan Heights. 
  In response to a question regarding his optimism about 
Syrian-Israeli negotiations, President Mubarak said: I am 
optimistic because there is no other alternative. We will help 
the Syrians any time they ask for help; we will spare no efforts 
in this respect. 
  Asked whether instability in the Middle East basically 
results from extremist Islamic movements, President Mubarak said 
that there is no problem in Egypt because it has deep roots and 
several religions have survived in Egypt for thousands of years. 
We are capable of overcoming any crisis. We have encountered 
crises before; this one poses no problems for Egypt. He said: 
There are several problems in certain Middle Eastern countries; 
but I do not believe that the extremists are successful, because 
most people are against the extremists. We will overcome this 
problem, although it may take some time. 
  When asked about his views on the real danger to world peace 
at present, President Mubarak said that the Americans and French 
may have more specific views regarding the international 
situation. As for Europe, he said that the situation in 
Yugoslavia and Bosnia poses an extremely serious problem, noting 
that a solution to the Bosnian problem is imminent. He said 
that at one time there was a plan to isolate the Muslims of 
Bosnia, which would be an extremely serious matter. He stated 
that it is very serious to isolate the Muslims even though they 
have long been allowed to coexist with other peoples of 
different religions. He noted that if the Muslims find 
themselves isolated, it may plant a time bomb in the heart of 
Europe. He noted that the French and British share this view, 
adding: I think they have avoided this danger and efforts are 
under way to find a solution. I hope they will find one. 
  On the situation in Rwanda, President Mubarak said that two 
tribes are fighting each other there and one of them has accused 
Egypt of supplying arms to the other one. He stressed that 
Egypt is not supplying arms to either side. He noted that we 
had a contract last year and it was fulfilled before the crisis 
erupted. Another contract was signed before the crisis, but 
Egypt froze it when the fighting broke out. 
  On the long-standing Romanian-Egyptian relations, 
particularly in the wake of the political developments in 
Romania during the past four years, President Mubarak said: We 
were concerned at first about the situation in Romania. He 
said: We have always maintained good ties with Romania and we 
were concerned that the situation there might deteriorate 
seriously, but it transpired that the situation has changed for 
the better, which is very important. He said: We have 
traditionally had good relations with the Romanian people. I am 
very happy that the Romanians are proceeding along the right 
path. He stressed that Egyptian-Romanian ties are currently 
extremely good, as they have always been, and he noted that the 
recent slowdown in relations was not prompted by Egypt but by 
the changes that occurred in Romania. He said he wished to 
visit Bucharest soon, noting that his last visit to Romania was 
a long time ago.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR 
denounces Yemeni leaders for continuing to ignore the reality of 
what they are doing, not only to their homeland but also to the 
Arab and Islamic world. These leaders continue to tamper with 
the future of coming generations, who will never forgive them 
for the innocent blood they shed and the installations and 
utilities they destroyed, which belong to all the Yemeni people. 
  In an editorial today, AL-AKHBAR states that Egypt and its 
leader Husni Mubarak advised Yemeni leaders to use dialogue to 
settle the Yemeni crisis and has repeatedly warned against 
resorting to arms, particularly between brothers. It points out 
that the fate of a homeland and people must not be decided by 
officials who are controlled by arrogance and personal whims. 
It says that a leader who is not concerned about the interests 
of his homeland and people is unworthy of his post and he had 
better look for another job in the interest of his people.

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The Egyptian Central Bank's 
latest report emphasizes that the annual service of Egypt's 
foreign debts totalled 2.5 billion dollars at the end of March 
1993. This sum amounts to 12 percent of the revenue of foreign 
currencies, part of which is used to service foreign debts. In 
a statement to AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM newspaper, Dr. Yusuf Butrus 
Ghali, minister of state for international cooperation, pointed 
out that the safe limit regarding the service of foreign debt 
must not exceed 24 percent, noting that there is a surplus of 
approximately 9 percent as an additional margin to the safe 
limit. 
  Dr. Ghali pointed out that the volume of serving Egypt's 
foreign debts in 1987 reached 52 percent of the revenue of 
foreign currency. He expected that the service of Egypt's 
foreign debts in the next five years will drop to 6 percent of 
the revenue of foreign currency if the size of foreign debts 
maintains its ratio and if the current rate of borrowing remains 
unchanged.

  [Text] Marwan Kanafani, adviser to the Palestinian 
president, has said that reports on 'Arafat's visit to Gaza and 
Jericho are untrue. He said the Palestinian president will 
announce his final return to embrace his people day and night 
after he and the Palestinian leadership have completed the 
necessary organizational, administrative, and financial measures 
for a final return and for beginning the construction of the 
homeland, as he put it. 
  Earlier, Palestinian and diplomatic sources said that 
'Arafat 
would pay a short visit to the autonomous areas over the next 
seven days. However, Kanafani did not decisively rule out the 
idea that 'Arafat might visit the autonomous areas before his 
final return.

  [Text] Another 80 Palestinian prisoners who are members of 
the rejectionist organizations were released from prison today 
and sent to their homes in the territories. Our correspondent 
Moti Amir reports that these prisoners agreed to sign a 
declaration vowing not to act against the peace agreement. 
Another 570 prisoners who were scheduled to be released in 
accordance with the Cairo agreement refused to sign the 
declaration. 
  Sa'ib 'Urayqat accused Israel of violating the Cairo 
agreement with regard to the Palestinian prisoners. In a news 
conference in Jericho, 'Urayqat said that according to the 
agreement all the political prisoners, as he put it, must be 
released unconditionally. He noted that Israel's demand that the 
prisoners sign any document constitutes blackmail. In his 
opinion, the fact that the prisoners are taken to Jericho also 
represents a violation of the agreement because Israel must 
allow them to return to their homes. 
  'Urayqat also criticized the roadblocks erected by Israel on 
the highways leading to the autonomous area, saying they prevent 
tourists from entering the self-rule areas.

<F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>
  [Text] [Correspondent Moti Amir] The IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] and the Prisons Service today released the last 
Palestinian prisoner according to the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement. Today, 170 Palestinian prisoners were released and 
sent to their homes in the territories; another 160 criminals 
are being transferred from Israeli prisons to the central prison 
in Gaza; while 650 prisoners belonging to Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] and the Islamic Jihad were not released 
because they refused to sign a statement declaring that they 
will not resort to violence against the Gaza and Jericho 
agreement and will remain within the boundaries of the autonomy 
in Gaza and Jericho. 
  Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head of the joint security 
committee, said today: We have thus fulfilled our commitment 
under the Cairo agreement, as all those who refused to sign the 
declaration today are on the list of those who were to be 
released. 
  [Sami'] Therefore, in general, if we add up all the 
figures I mentioned, we arrive at more than 4,900 prisoners who 
were released or listed as slated for release. Hence, the 
security committee declares unequivocally, with the agreement of 
the two parties, that Israel has thus fulfilled the Cairo 
agreement, which stipulated the release of some 5,000 
prisoners. 
  [Amir] Incidentally, the fate of more than 900 prisoners who 
were not released because of their refusal to sign the 
declaration will be discussed in the next round of negotiations 
on the release of prisoners. Gen. Sami' made it clear today 
that several categories of released prisoners have been agreed 
on with the Palestinians. Only a small group of prisoners who 
had been given short terms were allowed to return to their homes. 
  [Sami'] Prisoners belonging to one of the categories 
on which the two parties agreed, based on the signed agreement, 
will be returned to the area of the autonomy; that is, Gaza 
residents will be sent to the Gaza Strip, and residents of 
Judaea and Samaria will be sent to Jericho. This agreement 
remains valid. We renewed the validity of this agreement last 
Monday and once again today, just to be sure. None of the 
parties questions this agreement. 
  [Amir] Samir al-Siqsiq, alias Abu-Hamis, the Palestinian 
representative at the joint security committee, says that Israel 
did everything it could to implement the agreement on the 
prisoner release: 
  [Al-Siqsiq, in English] Had these 650 people from the 
Islamic groups signed, they would have been released today. We 
had all the arrangements ready for them. I think, in all 
fairness, the Israeli side has tried to see that the agreement 
be fulfilled. 
  [Amir] No released prisoners will be brought to Jericho 
today 
because none of the candidates to go there signed the 
declaration, which is a prerequisite for their release.

  [Text] Gaza City, Gaza Strip, June 16 (AFP) -- Israel 
released the deputy leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement 
HAMAS on Thursday among several hundred Palestinians set free, 
Palestinian sources said. 
  Sa'id Abu-Musamih, 47, one of the co-founders of the Moslem 
fundamentalist group, was serving life for his activities. 
  When Israel arrested HAMAS chief Shaykh Ahmad Yasin in 1989, 
Abu-Musamih took over as head of the movement before he was 
imprisoned the following year. 
  Yasin, sentenced to life in 1991 for murder and incitement 
to 
violence, remains in jail having refused an offer of freedom 
conditional on a pledge to renounce terrorism.

  [Text] Gaza, from Jamal al-Halabi and Nidal 
al-Mughrabi--Dr. Nabil Sha'th has stated that the detainees have 
the right to be fully liberated, regardless of their places of 
residence or their political affiliations. He stressed that the 
basic conditions we have accepted are: 
  1. That the prisoner abide by the PLO commitments. 
  2. That those convicted of civil crimes be handed over to 
the Palestinian authority so as to continue their imprisonment 
or to keep them under the Palestinian authority's supervision. 
  He added: Anything other than this would be an Israeli 
violation of the agreement and we will struggle to rectify it. 
  Reacting to reports about the formation of a new security 
liaison committee and the changing of the security liaison 
committee that signed the Gaza agreement on the detainees, Dr. 
Sha'th said: Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya will head 
the Palestinian side in the higher "Palestinian-Israeli" 
security committee because he had the same job in the 
Gaza-Jericho negotiations and knows all the agreement's details. 
Brig. Gen. Ziyad al-Atrash is a Palestinian military and 
security asset and we need him in all the security positions. 
  He added: There is a problem with the Israeli side on 
whether the West Bank prisoners will go to their houses or will 
be confined within the Palestinian authority's areas after their 
liberation. We do not want hundreds of people to feel that they 
are in Jericho which cannot provide houses. We refuse to 
deprive the released detainees from returning to their families. 
We are struggling to solve this problem. 
  Dr. Nabil Sha'th said: Anyone who carries the Gaza-Jericho 
identity card has the right to enter the West Bank. Any person 
who carries the West Bank identity card has the right to enter 
Gaza and Jericho. Banning any person from doing so would be an 
Israeli security violation of the spirit of the agreement. 
Israel has the right to grant its citizens entry visas to the 
Palestinian authority's areas and we have the right to grant 
entry visas to Israel and the West Bank. 
  The Palestinian official went on to say that programs for 
the 
infrastructure and public utilities have been drawn up and that 
around half of the international aid will be allocated to 
housing. There are plans for tourist, agricultural, and 
industrial projects. Palestinian investors will be the source of 
Palestinian economic growth. They will bring tourist and 
commercial projects that will earn profits but will also benefit 
the homeland. Our role is to provide the necessary facilities 
for them. 
  He added: There is talk about a comprehensive project for 
cleaning Gaza after one month and that will employ around 15,000 
workers for three months. All the aftereffects of the 
occupation and the piles of garbage will be removed during that 
period. I am seeking to collect aid to finance this project, 
which will be similar to the one in Rafah which is financed by 
the EC. He said: An international airport will be built. The 
first flights from it are agreed on and will not need permits: 
Gaza-Jericho and Gaza-Cairo. Other routes need permits. 
  Dr. Sha'th denied reports that the Palestinian president 
will 
be coming today. He said that the Palestinian authority will be 
informed of his date of arrival at least three days before that 
date.

  [Text] Gaza, 16 Jun (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, minister of 
planning and international cooperation in the Palestinian 
National Authority, has affirmed that he has returned to his 
homeland, Palestine, from his second homeland, Egypt. And 
despite all the difficulty in leaving Egypt after more than 40 
years, he has returned to stay and to plan a new life. He has 
returned to live in his homeland. 
  In an interview with Basimah Nafadi, MENA correspondent in 
Gaza, Sha'th said that he has resigned from all his other jobs 
and has returned to his homeland. He said: "We have all 
struggled to return to our homeland. There should be no 
hesitation on the part of anyone to return to Palestine to build 
this homeland for whose liberation and independence we have 
struggled. The time has now come to struggle to build it." 
  Sha'th admitted that the current situation in the Gaza Strip 
and Jericho is difficult. But he added that hope, anticipation, 
defiance, and aspirations fill the hearts of all Palestinians. 
He noted that among the problems that must be tackled are the 
thousands of detainees, wounded, and handicapped and the need to 
rehabilitate them. This is in addition to the problems of 
unemployment, building the Palestinian economy, and establishing 
a state. This, he said, requires an effective, clean, fair, 
capable, and modern government. 
  Sha'th said that just as we have established the Palestinian 
police who regained the people's confidence after 27 years of 
occupation, an effective Palestinian government administration 
will win the confidence of the donor countries to begin 
providing the necessary funds for infrastructure projects. 
Palestinian and Arab investors will also begin establishing 
projects to build a strong Palestinian economy. 
  Sha'th said that infrastructure and public utility programs 
have already been prepared. About half of the international aid 
will be allocated for housing. There are also plans for 
tourism, agricultural, and industrial projects. Palestinian 
investors, he said, will greatly contribute to the development 
of the Palestinian economy, noting that he has met with many of 
them since he arrived in Gaza. 
  Regarding the Paris meeting of donor countries, Sha'th said 
that this meeting has created a new relationship with the 
Palestinian National Authority. He noted that the problem of 
Palestinian police salaries is being resolved and that their 
salaries for the months of April and May have been paid. 
  He said that he met last night and until 0300 today with 
Palestinian police and security commanders and discussed their 
needs and resolved their problems. He said that efforts are 
currently being made to solve the problems of more than 50,000 
members of the families of 7,000 Palestinian policemen. He 
admitted that this is a big problem, as there is need to provide 
housing for these families under difficult conditions that exist 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
  Sha'th said that he was able to see first-hand the enormous 
economic problems facing the Palestinian people. Workers are 
prevented from returning to their jobs in Israel, and only about 
5,000 of the 150,000 workers have been allowed to return. The 
Israeli authorities have also not given permits to car and truck 
drivers to travel to Jericho or even to enter the West Bank. 
This is in addition to problems of unemployment and problems 
that people arriving through the Rafah crossing point are facing 
from the Israelis.

<F P=106> [Report by Sami 'Abudi and Samiyah Nakhkhul: "PLO Dismisses </F>
Officials Who Exceeded Their Authority"] 
  [Excerpt] Jerusalem, Cairo -- A Palestinian official said 
Tuesday that the PLO has dismissed officials who signed an 
interim agreement with Israel confining the movement of 
Palestinian prisoners released by Israel to the autonomy area of 
Jericho. He added that these officials, who were members of the 
[Joint] Liaison Committee with Israel which observes security in 
the autonomy areas of Jericho and the Gaza Strip, were not 
authorized to sign. After seven tense hours, 287 prisoners were 
handed over to the Palestinian police in Jericho last week. 
Israel says that the Cairo agreement on autonomy allows it to 
insist that the prisoners handed over to the Palestinians should 
remain in the autonomy areas. Faysal al-Husayni, the most 
senior PLO official in the West Bank, has stated that the person 
who signed the agreement had no authority to sign, and that is 
why a decision was issued to replace the Palestinian Security 
Committee with another committee. 
  Al-Husayni left for Jordan yesterday, Tuesday, and is 
expected to travel to Tunis for a meeting with 'Arafat.

  [Text] Tehran, June 16, IRNA -- 'Abu Hamdan, chief of the 
Tehran bureau of the Palestinian Islamic movement, Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] said here Thursday that PLO leader 
Yasir 'Arafat in a bid to discourage Hamas from continuing its 
armed struggle had offered it to take part in Gaza-Jericho plan. 
  According to Arafat's proposal, Hamas has been offered to 
share the administration of Gaza and Jericho with al-Fatah, the 
PLO's mainstream organization, 'Abu Hamdan said. 
  He told IRNA that Hamas leaders had turned down the proposal 
and instead called on the PLO chairman to rejoin the Palestinian 
nation and continue the armed struggle to liberate Palestine. 
  He refuted some western press allegations that Hamas was 
conditionally ready to participate in Gaza-Jericho self-rule 
plan and said, "We believe that Gaza-Jericho has not been 
liberated but rather the area which covers only two percent of 
whole Palestinian territory, has turned into a protectorate of 
the Zionist regime." 
  'Abu Hamdan said that Hamas will never accept the plan, 
because it is a Satanic plot aimed at guaranteeing security of 
the Zionists and occupying the region economically. 
  Asked about an alternative formula acceptable to Hamas, he 
said that based on the past experiences territories taken by 
force should be recaptured by force and that negotiations with 
the Zionists meant selling out the rights of Palestinian nation 
to them.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of </F>
the Palestinian National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi; place and 
date not given; from the "With the Midday Events" program -- 
recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi: You and your FIDA 
[Palestinian Democratic Federation Party] colleague, Yasir 
'Abd-Rabbuh, are threatening to resign from the Palestinian 
National Authority [PNA]. Why? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] It is not a threat, but an expression of our 
party's stand on the preparations under way by the PNA. We have 
serious observations about the PNA's procrastination in the 
adoption of sufficient and necessary measures to seriously and 
directly assume its role, so that an authority vacuum does not 
occur in the territories from which the Israeli authority has 
withdrawn. 
  [Mu'addi] What are these reservations, doctor? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] First, brother Yasir 'Arafat and the essential 
PLO leading cadre should quickly return to the territories. 
This particularly applies to the group that followed up the 
negotiations with Israel on the Cairo agreement. Now that 
brothers Nabil Sha'th and 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya have returned, 
it is necessary that other brothers who took part in the 
formulation on this agreement return so they can directly 
supervise its immediate implementation. Administrative and 
financial issues should be completed so this authority can 
assume its role. So far, we still feel there is procrastination 
and that the question is not taken seriously. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, is this stand by you perhaps because of 
the marginalization of the FIDA status in the PNA? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] This is irrelevant, for FIDA has willingly 
selected its two portfolios. Brother Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh has 
selected the culture and arts portfolio. I selected the youth 
care and sports portfolios. In fact, all those involved have 
selected their portfolios with complete freedom. So far, we 
cannot say that serious work has started in either of these two 
fields, or any other field. When we have made some observations 
public, they were intended to be addressed to all fields of 
Palestinian authority rather than those two fields only. I 
believe the vacuum resulting from the PNA's failure so far to 
assume its role seriously damages more than only FIDA and its 
representatives on the PNA. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi, a last question: Have contacts been 
held with the PLO leadership, particularly Yasir 'Arafat in this 
regard? 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] The FIDA representatives in Tunis are 
authorized to raise this issue with brother Yasir 'Arafat. I 
believe a special session was held in Tunis yesterday to discuss 
these issues, including the FIDA observations about the 
preparations so far. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, member of the PNA, thank 
you 
very much. 
  [Al-Shu'aybi] Not at all.

<F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein] </F>
  [Text] The two problems most worrying Palestinians in the 
territories is unemployment and the worsening of their living 
standards and economic situation. This was stated by 86.2 
percent of 1,974 respondents who participated in a public 
opinion poll conducted on 31 May by the Nabulus-based Center for 
Palestine Research and Studies. The poll shows that more than 
half of the respondents view the Gaza-Jericho agreement 
favorably and points to an increase in support for Fatah and a 
decrease in support for Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]. 
  The Nabulus research center began conducting public opinion 
polls after the signing of the Declaration of Principles in 
September 1993, with the current poll being its ninth. 
  This poll was conducted after the IDF [Israel Defense 
Forces] 
withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, the arrival of the Palestinian 
police force, the release of hundreds of prisoners from jail, 
the appointment of the members of the Palestinian Authority, and 
the implementation of the first steps to strengthen the 
Palestinian self-rule in the autonomy. 
  According to the poll, fear of chaos and of the inability of 
the Palestinian Authority to enforce law and order ranks second, 
with 66.7 percent saying they considered it the toughest problem. 
  Fear of the suppression of opposition groups by the 
Palestinian Authority and police ranks third, with 54.8 percent 
saying this is the issue most troubling them, and only 44.7 
percent saying they are worried about rivalry between 
Palestinians in the territories and abroad. 
  The poll shows that more than half of the population (57.3 
percent) views the Gaza-Jericho agreement favorably, with 39.6 
percent saying the agreement is excellent and 17.7 percent 
saying it is fair. Some 39.2 percent said the agreement is 
unsatisfactory or bad. Gaza Strip and Jericho residents were 
more prone to take a positive view of the agreement than 
residents of the West Bank. 
  The residents of the territories seem to take a sympathetic 
view of the Palestinian police and security troops, with 50.6 
percent believing they will treat all people equally and 16.8 
percent believing they will suppress Palestinian opposition. 
  A change was registered on this issue among Hamas supporters 
in the Gaza Strip. In the poll conducted in December 1993, 53 
percent of them believed the police would suppress the 
opposition, whereas only 12.3 percent of them held the same view 
in the current poll. 
  The pollsters note that most policemen in Gaza have 
relatives 
in the area and that this fact -- in addition to the warm 
reception accorded them by the local population -- made Hamas 
supporters change their mind. 
  As for the balance of power between the political 
organizations in the territories, support for Fatah increased 
6.6 percent compared with the poll in April 1994, whereas 
support for Hamas declined 4.3 percent, particularly in the Gaza 
Strip. In the last months of 1993, polls had been showing a 
constant drop in support for Fatah. 
  The current poll shows support for Fatah was highest in the 
Gaza Strip (an average of 53.6 percent) and in Jericho (50 
percent). Support for Hamas, the second largest political body 
in the territories, was highest -- when compared with other 
areas -- in Jericho (20 percent) and in Hebron (17.7 percent). 
  Nevertheless, a considerable number of respondents supported 
"independents" who are not identified with any political bodies 
but are believed to be pro-national or pro-Islamic. Support for 
these "independents" was more evident in the West Bank than in 
the Gaza Strip: 28.5 percent in East Jerusalem, 25.1 percent in 
Hebron, and 23.3 percent in Ramallah. 
  Asked how they would vote if general elections to the 
Palestinian council were held on the day of the poll, 44.4 
percent said they would vote for Fatah, 12.3 percent for Hamas, 
10.8 percent for pro- national independents, 4.7 percent for 
pro-Islamic independents, and 6.6 percent for the PFLP [Popular 
Front for the Liberation of Palestine]. 
  Support for all other organizations ranged from 1 to 3 
percent. The total of people who would vote for the main 
opposition organizations (Hamas, Islamic Jihad, PFLP, and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine) came to 23.7 
percent.

  [Text] After his visit to Switzerland, Foreign Minister 
Velayati attended a discussion with Bonn's representative of the 
Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran, where he spoke 
about the duties of the World Forum and its significance. 
Velayati said: During the past few years, this forum has held 
annual sessions in Crans Montana in Switzerland and has gained 
great significance in the world. The objective of this forum is 
to develop political-economic possibilities and to create the 
grounds and facilities for exchanges of views among 
personalities from all the countries of the world. 
  Referring to the significant and strategic regional role of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran in relation to important issues 
such as the Central Asian countries and the crisis in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Velayati said: By clarifying the Islamic 
Republic's stances on the situation in the northern republics 
and the steps that Iran has taken to help preserve their 
independence, to mitigate and to overcome ethnic clashes, and to 
increase cooperation with these countries within the framework 
of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and the Organization 
of the Caspian Sea Littoral countries, we have played a pivotal 
and major role in past sessions. Thus, this year--thanks to 
efforts that have been made--explaining the economic-political 
position of the Islamic Republic of Iran at home and in the 
region became one of the most important and major programs of 
the World Forum and the first day of this year's session was 
devoted to Iran. 
  Continuing, Velayati referred to the comprehensive program 
prepared for the day devoted to the Islamic Republic of Iran at 
the forum and said: In this program, President 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani participated in a direct satellite link at 
the request of the organizers of the session--unprecedented at 
World Forum sessions--and answered questions put to him by 
participants in the forum. 
  In conclusion, Velayati referred to the participation of our 
country's commercial, economic, and banking officials at the 
session and the briefing of about 600 political and economic 
personalities from more than 40 countries of the world about 
Iran's economic, commercial, and industrial plans, and expressed 
hopes that the grounds for the growth and the further expansion 
of economic, commercial, and industrial cooperation between Iran 
and the other countries of the world will be paved.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Iran-Iraq Ties"] </F>
  [Text] An Iranian delegation left yesterday for Baghdad to 
prepare a visit next month by Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar 
Velayati, the first high-ranking official to visit Iraq since 
the 1991 Iraq-Kuwait conflict. 
  Nearly six years after the bloody Iraq-Iran war which ended 
in a humiliating defeat for Saddam Husayn's forces, the two 
neighbors are yet to reach a settlement on a number of issues, 
particularly the fate of POWs and those missing in action, and 
applying U.N. resolution 598 to pay war reparations to Iran. 
  Islamic Iran has emerged as a powerful country in the 
region. 
And Iraq, despite being militarily dismantled after its invasion 
of Kuwait, and its economy left in a shambles following the U.N. 
trade embargo, has rebuilt its infrastructure at a stupendous 
pace. It is said that 90 percent of its transport and 
communication links have been restored. Iraq's starving 
children are only useful media images to buttress its campaign 
against the U.N. sanctions. Saddam Husayn stands out as a 
challenge to the West again. 
  Middle East observers say that Washington perceives Iraq, 
rather than Iran, as the main security threat in the region. 
However, given the fact that the United States is determined to 
pursue the so-called policy of 'dual containment' of both Iran 
and Iraq, improvement of bilateral ties would be of mutual 
benefit to the two neighbors. 
  Moreover, Iraq has learned its lessons well with respect to 
Iran. Baghdad knows that it can't beat Tehran. Externally, 
Baghdad is isolated. Internally, Saddam has formidable problems 
to contend with, besides a shattered economy. Some of his own 
people are rebelling against his leadership. Besides, he has 
not been able to crush the Shiite and Kurdish uprisings. Thus, 
Baghdad is aware that it is in its own interests to cooperate 
with the Iranian government rather than confront it. 
  For Iran too, it would be useful to have good relations with 
Iraq. Iraq is not just another Arab country; it has enough 
skilled and talented people. It was these same people who 
restored their country's infrastructure without any outside 
help, evoking a certain degree of admiration. 
  The two sides will have a lot of important issues to 
discuss. 
Another area of importance is trade. Once the U.N. sanctions 
are lifted, Iran can be a major supplier of goods to Iraq. 
  The current talks will, no doubt, be focussed on removing 
the 
obstacles to improving relations, rather than rapid 
normalization of ties, which can't be foreseen in the immediate 
future. 
  The onus rests on Iraq, to help clear the way for restoring 
Iran's confidence in Baghdad, for its was Saddam Husayn who was 
responsible for creating the divide between the two nations. 
  Tehran's mistrust and lack of faith in the Baghdad regime is 
not without reason. Baghdad has been supporting the outlawed 
Mojahedin-e Kahlq outfit, which is launching cross border 
attacks from inside Iraq. Extraditing its leader Mas'ud Rajavi 
will remove doubts that Baghdad is supporting the terrorist 
organization's activities, and may set the right note to tackle 
more important issues.

<F P=106> [Report by Udo Ulfkotte: "Iran Wants To Send 10,000 </F>
Soldiers to Bosnia"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt, 15 June -- Iran is prepared to place 
10,000 Iranians at the disposal of the United Nations for 
employment in Bosnia, Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati 
mentioned this to this newspaper. "Not a single other state of 
the world" is "willing to send such a large number of soldiers 
to Bosnia," Velayati said. He said that U.S. assertions that 
Iranians are already fighting on the side of the Bosnian Muslims 
"cannot be proven." So far, Iran has "only" provided 
"humanitarian" help to the Bosnian Government. President 
Rafsanjani has called on Iranian youth to prepare for the 
mission in Bosnia. However, they must be dispatched in 
agreement with the United Nations. So far, an answer to the 
Iranian offer has not yet been received from the United Nations, 
he said. 
  One day after the official announcement of the pardon for 
German mechanical engineer Szimkus, who was sentenced to death 
in Iran for espionage for Iraq, Velayati said: "The release of 
the German depends on agreements that we still have to make with 
German institutions." Minister of State Schmidbauer, who is 
reponsible for the coordination of the intelligence services in 
the Chancellor's Office, said on Tuesday [14 June]: "I proceed 
on the assumption that Szimkus might be on German territory 
within four weeks." Velayati rejected speculations that, in 
connection with the pardon for the German, clear concessions had 
been made to the Iranians accused in the Berlin Mykonos lawsuit. 
"We are only calling for a just sentence in the Mykonos 
lawsuit," the foreign minister said. At the same time, he denied 
Iran's intention to transfer ownership of the Island of Kish in 
the Persian Gulf, together with the luxurious recreational 
facilities that had been built under the Shah, to the FRG, in 
order to repay Iran's high debts to German enterprises. Radio 
Tehran had reported relevant considerations on 31 May. With 
outstanding accounts of 4.2 billion German marks, Germany is 
Iran's biggest creditor. In the same radio report, President 
Rafsanjani said: "Iran's capital investments in Germany are 
higher than the amount that Iran owes to Germany." Velayati 
said: "Nobody has the authority to give an Iranian island away." 
  According to Velayati, in the Israeli-Arab conflict, Iran 
wants to continue its support for the fundamentalist Hamas 
movement despite the peace process. Support, which he called 
"humanitarian and moral," is necessary because the difficulties 
have not yet been solved. Pediatrician Velyati, who has been 
Iranian foreign miniser since 1981, said: "We do not expect the 
Israeli-Arab peace process to change the situation. The 
so-called peace process will fail." There are still more than 
200 Jewish settlements in the territories occupied by Israel and 
4 million Palestinians are still living in the refugee camps in 
Israel's neighboring states. An agreement has neither been 
achieved on the future of the Golan Heights nor on the Israeli 
occupation of a 10-km-wide border strip in Lebanon. "Mr. 
'Arafat" will "only be the mayor of Gaza and Jericho," but 
otherwise "nothing has changed." Therefore, support for the 
radical pro- Iranian Hamas will be continued. Meanwhile, the 
Israeli Finance Ministry reported on Wednesday that, if the 
financial means promised to the PLO by European states do not 
immediately arrive in the autonomous territories, Hamas, which 
is supported by Iran, will "infiltrate $20 to 30 million" and 
try to undermine the PLO's policy in this way. 
  An important prerequisite for the reestablishment of 
diplomatic relations with Iraq is Baghdad's preparedness to deny 
residence to the People's Mojahedin, who are operating from 
Iraqi territory. On the Iraqi side of the border, the People's 
Mojahedin maintain several bases northeast of Baghdad, from 
which they mount attacks in Iran. There are "indications that" 
an agreement can be achieved on it with Iraq," said Velayati, 
who will travel again to Baghdad in July for the first time 
since the beginning of the Iraqi-Iranian war in 1980. Next 
week, an Iranian delegation will prepare Velayati's visit to 
Baghdad. The Iranian foreign minister will discuss the fate of 
25,000 missing Iranians from the first Gulf war and closer 
regional cooperation. He is prepared to also discuss the Iraqi 
aircraft that had been taken to Iran before the war for Kuwait's 
liberation. However, they can only be returned after a relevant 
UN decision has been made, Velayati said. The Iranian foreign 
minister, whose government repeatedly called for Saddam Husayn's 
overthrow in the past and is still granting asylum and support 
to leading members of the Iraqi opposition in Tehran, now said 
that the Iraqi people have to decide for themselves whether 
Saddam Husayn will continue to be in power. In 1987 Velayati 
still offered "new security guarantees" to the United Arab 
Emirates [UAE] in the event of Saddam's overthrow. Now he said 
that Iran will "not interfere in the internal affairs of Iraq." 
  The Iranian foreign minister warned the six member states of 
the Gulf Cooperation Council (Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Kuwait, 
Qatar, Bahrain) against a military intervention in the Yemeni 
war and said: "This would be a big mistake in the region." Iran 
supports Yemen's unity. Velayati rejected assertions that 
Tehran is supporting the north Yemeni leadership with weapons.

<F P=106> [Report by Daryush Sajjadi] </F>
  [Text] Tehran--"Bosnia is the greatest shame for Western 
civilization," said Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Minister Irfan 
Ljubijankic. 
  Irfan denounced Britain saying London had adopted the 
dirtiest policy for the destruction of Bosnia. 
  The foreign minister arrived here on Friday [10 June] at the 
invitation of Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati for talks 
with Iranian officials on Balkan problems. 
  In an exclusive interview with the TEHRAN TIMES, Irfan 
denied 
the British allegation that the Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo 
circulated a letter in which London was blamed for the 
deteriorating situation in Bosnia. 
  "Not Iran, but we, Bosnians, circulated that letter which 
mentioned simple facts," Irfan said. 
  British policy on Bosnia is transparent and no document is 
needed to prove that London has adopted the disgusting course 
against Bosnian Muslims, Irfan said. 
  He scoffed at the logic of Britain, France and Russia who 
claim that the arms embargo has been imposed on former 
Yugoslavia to curb bloodshed in that war-torn country. 
  "This assumption is wrong," he said. "Bloodshed could have 
been restricted if there would have been a balance of weapons 
between the Muslims and Serbs," he said. 
  "The continuation of the arms embargo is one of the reasons 
we consider Russia, Britain and France partners in the crimes of 
the Serbs," Irfan said. 
  "Bosnia is not situated in Latin America or Africa, it is 
sitting in the heart of Europe, that claims to be the most 
civilized," Irfan said, adding that what is going on in Bosnia 
is the most shameful issue for the West. 
  He disputed with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias 
who 
in a recent statement from Tehran said that the Bosnian issue 
belongs to Europe and the fact is Europe does not want an 
Islamic state in that continent. 
  However, he said, there are a great number of open-minded 
people in Europe who accept Muslims and Islam and they denounce 
the feelings of apprehension for Islam. 
  "We are a peaceful nation and do not want to bother others," 
Irfan said.

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>
  [Text] Oil ministers from the 12 OPEC member countries have 
gathered since yesterday in Vienna to assess, within the 96th 
session of the organization, the issues concerning OPEC. 
  Establishing the level of oil production ceiling in the 
third 
quarter of the current Christian year in view of market 
conditions, electing a new secretary general, and deciding to 
change the location of the OPEC secretariat are among the main 
topics of the discussions of OPEC's 96th session. 
  It should be mentioned that in the last session of the oil 
ministers which was held in the month of Farvardin [March-April] 
of the current year the level of OPEC production was established 
at 24.520 million barrels per day. In the past two month, as a 
result of the commitment shown by the members to the fixed 
quotas and of the emergence of signs of improvement in the world 
economy, a new round was created to increase the price of oil. 
It was thus that the OPEC oil marker price reached $16. 
  Although the price sought by OPEC for its marker price was 
determined at $21 per barrel and the organization still has a 
long way to go to reach its target, the existing climate at 
OPEC's 96th session manifests the willingness of all the members 
to maintain the present production ceiling. Despite the fact 
that the demand for oil has overtaken its supply and despite the 
increasing prices, OPEC's still aims to control the level of 
production. 
  In the viewpoint of economic experts, the fluctuations in 
the 
oil prices have a very important effect on the development plans 
of the members of OPEC. These countries are mainly dependent on 
oil income and even a dollar reduction in the oil price will 
reduce the income of the member countries by $9 billion. 
  Therefore, under the present situation, where it seems that 
members of OPEC are united in their view in protecting the 
production ceiling despite the oil demand and economic problems 
of the member countries, this hope will be created that once 
again OPEC, which has passed through three decades of 
experiences and ups and downs, will find its true position and 
authority in the international economic arena. 
  In the opinion of experts on oil issues, protecting the 
production ceiling of 24.5 million barrels per day, taking into 
account this prediction that demand will reach 26 million 
barrels per day during the 3rd and 4th quarter of the current 
Christian year, facilitates the process of achieving higher 
prices. However, the Islamic Republic of Iran, which has always 
strived to establish a just price for oil, supports any action 
that will lead to an increase in the oil price and gives 
authority to OPEC and believes that protecting the regular flow 
of oil supply to the world economy depends on stable prices. 
Such an aim will guarantee the interests of producers and 
consumers alike.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The President's Press Conference"] </F>
  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's free and frank talk 
with the world press is always a source of pride and comfort. 
Firstly, it pours cold water on those who still insist there is 
no freedom of expression in the Islamic Republic. Secondly, it 
boosts the morale of Iranians and their foreign friends when 
gloom and disillusionment get the better of them. Finally, it 
reminds world public opinion about the confidence and elegance 
of the elected president of Iran. 
  In our part of the world you cannot find even a few heads of 
states or government who hold, what is now generally come to be 
termed as, `open' press conferences. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani deserves congratulations for doing so, 
though the gaps between one press meeting and another have been 
widening. This may be rightly attributed to the chief 
executive's tight schedules, but his aides should ensure that 
the country's president receives journalists and commentators at 
regular intervals. It helps in boosting the nation's image. 
  On Tuesday more than 100 journalists were at the 
presidential 
bureau shooting queries on everything from the dress code for 
women to alleged nuclear cooperation with North Korea. Local 
and foreign scribes shot a volley of questions, sometimes 
irresponsibly and outside acceptable norms of protocol. The 
president fielded them in his usual sophisticated manner. 
  Our president's candor and self-confidence is envied in 
camps 
unwilling to accept Iranian realities. Irrespective of the fact 
that on several counts (mostly on the conduct of the economy) 
the president's point of view was not very convincing, of 
cardinal importance is the fact that Hashemi-Rafsanjani is a man 
who believes in what he is doing and sees no reason to conceal 
his thoughts. 
  There was also a barrage of questions on Islamic Iran's 
foreign policy. In short, clear and simple language the 
president made it known that his administration is keen on 
building normal relations with the international community. The 
universal truth that knowledge often fosters tolerance and 
understanding was amply clear between the lines. 
  Censuring the British Government for its misdeeds plus 
bugging Iran's diplomatic mission in London, the president said. 
"This wrong deed by the British has created an atmosphere of 
insecurity and mistrust in relations, which will have negative 
consequences." However, he added immediately that "we do not 
wish to see the existence of such an atmosphere among countries." 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani is now in his second, and probably last 
term of office. Opinion about his administration is mixed at 
home and abroad, depending on one's knowledge about pre- and 
post-revolutionary Iran. 
  For the second time this week President Hashemi-Rafsanjani 
chronicled the achievements made under his rule and insisted 
that Iran's economic condition is not as bad as some would like 
to publicize. Millions of Iranians saw and heard their 
president say this on TV. Many must have exchanged glances in 
disbelief. Mind you they, like millions across our Islamic 
nation, are people who want the president to succeed. On this 
count however, they could not help but disagree with him.

    The following additions complete the excerpted item 
headlined "Hashemi-Rafsanjani Holds News Conference," published 
in the 10 June Near East &amp; South Asia DAILY REPORT, pages 
44-58: 
  Page 44, column one, paragraph one make processing indicator 
read: [Text]. 
  Page 45, column one, paragraph six, from end of last 
sentence 
make read: ...policy? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] About the privatization policy, this 
policy began during the first five-year plan. It will continue 
in the second plan. We are carrying out the task gradually 
within the framework of the Constitution. That is, anything that 
the Constitution permits to be transferred to the private 
sector, will be privatized. The stock exchange has become more 
active recently, in recent months. The stock exchange will open 
branches in various cities and towns. The system was 
computerized to speed up the work. 
  About foreign investment... 
  Page 47, column one, paragraph six, from end of last 
sentence 
make read: ...economic readjustment policy. If today someone 
finds time to go around Iran, he will see for himself that in 
each corner of Iran an industrial township has been created and 
a large number of new industries are engaged in activities -- 
either they are being built or they have become operational. 
The readjustment policy allowed us to reach this stage. 
Otherwise -- we had a sum of oil money and used it to import 
goods and sell them cheap to people -- the old situation would 
have been repeated and nothing would have happened. 
  [Indian correspondent (?Sukimra)]... 
  Page 47, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last 
sentence make read: ...reached so far. 
  [RESALAT correspondent 'Abbas Tavangar] In the name of God, 
the compassionate, the merciful. Is the government planning to 
curtail economic growth so as to provide a greater degree of 
support for the deprived, the oppressed, and the salary earners 
in line with the growing inflation rate? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] There is no need to curtail economic 
growth, for we have performed some tasks in the first five-year 
plan which have paved the grounds for giving greater support to 
the deprived and the oppressed. First, more attention is paid 
to the deprived and war-stricken areas, which absorbed a large 
chunk of the first plan's budget. Second, we are currently 
preparing some programs to provide social welfare and national 
health insurance for the entire country. The government is 
currently debating these programs and you will be made aware of 
these programs when they are presented to the Majles. These 
programs plan to provide welfare and national insurance to 
everyone whose income is below a certain rational level, or to 
the unemployed. We hope to be able to solve this problem 
completely by the end of the second plan, without having to 
curtain economic growth. 
  [RESALAT correspondent] If... 
  Page 48, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last 
sentence make read: ...the court verdict. 
  [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] Mr. President. Please explain 
the latest decisions of the Council of the Economy on prices of 
services and goods. Will we have more price rises? And when 
will the price rises come into effect? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have typically approved all that was 
necessary concerning services and goods. We have apparently 
nothing remaining for the future. As far as I see the 
directives of the Council of the Economy every month, there is 
nothing in it for the future. Whatever that was there before 
has been carried out. 
  [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] This question was... 
(supplying 
passage omitted and correcting correspondent's first name from 
"Farid" to "Sa'id") 
  Page 51, column two, first partial paragraph, from the end 
of 
the last sentence make read: ...to see this. 
  [Unidentified person in hall reminds Rafsanjani to answer 
AFP 
correspondent's second question] 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani continues] The visit by... 
  Page 52, column one, paragraph two, from end of last 
sentence 
make read: ...The Islamic instructions. That means if we apply 
Islamic ideas to work, to extravagance, to justice, to obtaining 
the rights of the weak from the strong. If we could do all 
that, in our view, many problems that exist in many other places 
would not exist in such an atmosphere; or problems which the 
west is facing now because of moral issues, because of its 
promiscuity. We know what sort of problems families without 
breadwinners, orphaned children, widowed women and others have 
there. Such things would not exist in an Islamic atmosphere. 
And many other things. The philosophy cannot be applied 
partially and prejudicially. It is a combination and it should 
be applied as a whole. 
  [SALAM correspondent Nuri-Shemirani]... 
  Page 52, column one, paragraph four, from end of last 
sentence make read: ...and so on. We determine the price of 
some general goods through the guilds. The [Consumer] Protection 
Organization gets together with the unions and considering an 
appropriate profit for wholesalers, producers, and small 
businesses, they decide on three sets of prices that must be 
implemented. They ensure a fair profit and the customer can see 
and choose. This has nothing against trade and throughout the 
world, in countries which are more advanced in freedom of trade, 
such a method is used. 
  We believe that... 
  Page 53, column one, paragraph three, from end of last 
sentence make read: ...and income supplements. I believe that 
that they [those receiving benefits] have a good answer to your 
question. If you compare that, for instance, what they received 
five years ago under the sickness benefit coverage and what they 
get today then the answer to the question can be extracted. 
  [Fazel] Many thanks. My second question is about issuing 
coupons for laborers. Could you tell us whether such payments 
are given in the Second Plan as well, or not? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] During the First Plan we owed the 
laborers and the government had an undertaking dating back to 
the previous government which had not been paid out. And other 
undertakings were added to that in the First Plan. Some of that 
debt is still outstanding. We have said that the debt should be 
considered in the budget every year. I think that several years 
still remain for [complete payment of] that debt and it will be 
paid gradually, at the same level that we are paying this year. 
  [Fazel] I have... 
  Page 53, column one, paragraph eight, from end of last 
sentence make read: ...statement on that? The Egyptian 
government, Mr. Husni Mubarak's government believes that Iran is 
responsible for Islamic unrest in that country. Could you 
express your view on those allegations. 
  Second question: What... 
  Page 54, column one, paragraph five, from end of last 
sentence make read: ...would be convicted. 
  [Qotbi] My final question is about some apparent violations 
that have taken place regarding imports during 1370-1371 -- 
whether through the Free Trade Zones or the normal channels. 
For example some agreements which were granted in principle to 
some firms or individuals for founding vehicle production 
plants. They were such that a ceiling of up to 2,000 vehicles 
could be imported. I would like to ask in particular [about the 
fact] that more than that figure have been imported -- I mean 
one of those firms imported between 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles. 
Will such violations be confronted and how? 
  [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] If they have acted in violation they 
will definitely be confronted. We have no intention of letting 
any violation pass. Whenever we come to one or someone makes a 
claim we get it investigated. We refer it to the relevant 
courts. The system will really not make any concessions to 
anyone who seeks to commit violations... 
  Page 55, column two, paragraph five, sentence one make read: 
...[Correspondent Hajibabakhan, in Azeri with superimposed 
translation into Persian by interpreter] As a result...(deleting 
[passage omitted] editorial notation, clarifying that question 
in Azeri is faded out and Persian translation is superimposed).

  [Text] Sentiments expressed at the Jimmy Carter-Kim il-Song 
meeting in Pyongyang and President Clinton's immediate response 
have given rise to a glimmer of hope that the international 
community would retrieve itself from the precipice of a 
catastrophe. The former U.S. President Mr. Jimmy Carter at the 
outset appeals for friendship, understanding, and trade, and 
full diplomatic relations in return for total nuclear 
inspections and a verifiable nonweapons production guarantee by 
North Korea. 
  President Kim il-Song's reponse that it was suspicion and 
lack of trust which led to the crisis. His call for direct 
talks with Washington coupled with continued access to 
international inspectors to monitor the Yongbyong nuclear 
facility has brought good response from the United States. 
  President Clinton remarked that if North Korea means that it 
is willing to freeze its nuclear program while talks take place, 
this could be a promising step. Though an offer for nuclear 
freeze made by President Kim il-Song in return for diplomatic 
recognition and economic cooperation was spurned by President 
Clinton, Jimmy Carter in his second round of talks today would 
secure greater and convincing steps to guarantee that North 
Korea is prepared to give up its nuclear intentions. President 
Clinton's response comes at a time when China has firmly stated 
that it will maintain its defense arrangement with North Korea 
and it is against the sanctions. Russians also opposed it, 
though on non-consultation and non- consideration of its 
proposal of an international conference on the issue. With the 
Security Council resolution on sanctions not materializing, 
President Clinton would be left with the option to go it alone 
with his allies Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, and 
Britain. Without the powers to prevent merchant ships and 
freight aircraft from reaching North Korea, the United States 
would not be in a position to stop many nations and private 
businessmen in its alliance countries from trading with 
Pyongyang. Any move to prevent such trade could provoke North 
Korea. Even if shunned by many countries, it has immense powers 
to remain isolated and pursue its (?past). Beijing's support in 
the face of American moves would also vitalize its strength. 
Therefore, a more promising way out is constructive engagement 
through direct negotiations between the United States and North 
Korea. The second meeting between Jimmy Carter and President 
Kim il-Song moving in that direction is promising. The two 
could continue it in open negotiations or secret meetings. 
China and Russia could then relent on a milder Security Council 
resolution with more time for negotiations.

  [Text] New Delhi, June 11--Seven crude bombs were found 
yesterday at Talkatora Stadium, a couple of hours before the All 
India Congress Committee (AICC) session was to commence. The 
bombs were found near the main dais from where Prime Minister 
Narasimha Rao was to address the delegates and then remain 
seated there for some time. 
  Sources said the bombs were made of `sutli' (rope) and some 
explosive powder. However, these devices were meant to scare the 
security agencies and drive home the point that the elaborate 
network was pierced. The bombs did not have any time device or 
detonator. 
  These devices were found during the security drill two or 
three hours before the session was to commence. The bomb 
disposal experts detected the devices near the dais and took 
them away for analysis. Sources reiterated that the devices were 
placed by miscreants or terrorists to make their presence felt. 
They, apparently, did not want to explode bombs there. 
  Intelligence agencies were now making efforts to trace the 
loophole. They were alarmed about this breach in tight security. 
A massive security operation was launched three days before the 
session was to commence. Experts of the National Security Guards 
(NSG) bomb disposal squad, the Special Protection Group (SPG) 
were assisting the Delhi Police to ensure security. The main 
dais was handed over to the SPG 48 hours before the session was 
to commence. The bombs were found yesterday morning. 
  Two Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCP), nine Assistant 
Commissioners (ACP), ten inspectors, 50 sub-inspectors, 130 head 
constables and 600 constables of the Delhi Police were 
responsible for the security along with the SPG and other 
agencies. Separate parking lots were earmarked for the VlPs and 
only those cars with special parking labels were allowed to 
enter. 
  Security was tightened around the State guest houses where 
the VIPs including Chief Ministers were staying. Entry was 
restricted to the Talkatora Stadium and metal detectors were 
installed at all the entrances. 
  The hedges and thick foliage around the stadium were trimmed 
as a precaution and personnel of the para-military forces were 
stationed there. Trained `spotters' from the Intelligence Bureau 
(IB), the Delhi Police and other agencies fanned out in various 
places of the city to keep tabs on hide-outs of terrorists.

  [Text] OAU leaders and member governments yesterday 
unanimously called for the lifting of the unjust measures 
imposed on the Great Jamahiriyah. Moreover, they expressed 
their appreciation for the positive initiatives presented by the 
Jamahiriyah with a view to solving its crisis with western 
states. 
  At the end of OAU's 30th summit held in Tunis, African 
leaders adopted a resolution, issued by the Arab League, which 
called for the two suspects in the Lockerbie affair to be put on 
trial at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice. 
The African leaders stressed that this proposal was the 
suitable solution to this crisis and appealed in their 
resolution to the concerned western states to respond to 
initiatives calling for dialogue and negotiations to reach a 
settlement of the crisis, according to the sixth chapter of the 
UN charter which calls for the conflicts to be solved via 
negotiations and legal settlement.

  [Excerpts] JANA's local affairs editor has said that the 
African consensus expressed by the OAU was a clear and frank 
support to the Great Jamahiriyah from 53 African countries. 
[passage omitted] 
  These stances could then be considered as a consensus of the 
majority of world countries in support of the Great 
Jamahiriyah's position regarding a solution to its crisis with 
Western states. These stances express the real will of the 
international community and expose Western countries' stance 
which use their domination of the UN Security Council to [word 
indistinct] international resolutions and claim they express the 
will of the international community. 
  The editor said that this international consensus, in 
support 
of the great Jamahiriyah and which calls for the lifting of the 
unjust measures imposed on it by Western countries in the name 
of the UN Security Council, once again exposed the truth of this 
council and revealed the isolation in which these countries now 
find themselves against the voices of the world's countries, 
people, organizations, as well as political, cultural, and 
prominent social figures who expressed their true stances in 
support of the Great Jamahiriyah, not the stances fabricated in 
their names in the so-called Security Council under threats and 
blackmail from Western countries which dominate this Council. 
  Furthermore, the international community, embodied in these 
countries and organizations, demand that the UN Security Council 
acts with respect to the crisis between the Great Jamahiriyah 
and Western countries, according to the provisions of the sixth 
chapter of the UN Charter, because this is the right direction 
toward finding a solution to this crisis and toward an end to be 
put to the fallacy and the dilemma in which the council had 
fallen when it acted according to Article 7 of the UN Charter, 
an act that was a breach of this charter and an insult to the 
conscience and values of the international community and a 
falsification of its will.

  [Text] The brother leader of the revolution [Colonel 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi] hosted a dinner banquet last night in 
honor of Presidents Blaise Campaore, president of Burkina Faso, 
Alpha Oumar Konare, president of the Republic of Mali, and 
Mahamane Ousmane, president of the Republic of Niger, and the 
delegations accompanying them. The banquet was also attended by 
the secretary and members of the secretariat of the General 
People's Congress, the secretary and members of the General 
People's Committee, in addition to the heads of the diplomatic 
missions accredited to the Great Jamahiriyah and a number of 
army officers. 
  The brother leader of the revolution delivered a speech at 
the banquet and began by welcoming the leaders of these Islamic 
African states, Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso. The leader said 
that the Libyan people welcome and appreciate the solidarity of 
their African brethren and this solidarity reinforces the 
position of the Libyan people in confronting the conspiracy led 
by the three colonial western states. 
  The leader added: The triumph of the will of the peoples of 
Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso strengthens freedom and democracy. 
He also warned that the colonial western states are still 
involved in creating problems and hardship for those countries 
where the nationalist movements were victorious. He pointed out 
that it has become clear that the colonial western states which 
were accusing Libya of being behind the destabilization of the 
African continent were in fact themselves working hard to 
destabilize the situation in the African continent and prevent 
the latter from building itself. 
  The leader further said: The peoples of the Third World, 
whom 
the colonial western states are trying to force to surrender, 
have decided to resist and the West must understand this. He 
added: The West is now using the United Nations, after it tore 
up its Charter and trampled on its laws, as a neocolonialist 
means in the same way it used the League of Nations in the past 
to impose its mandate on the peoples of the Third World. 
  The brother leader warned: This trend which the western 
states are entrenching is a dangerous trend for the peoples of 
the world, will turn the world into a jungle, and will be 
responsible for its collapse.

  [Text] Nihad al-'Umari, wife of former Libyan Foreign 
Minister Mansur al-Kikhya left for the Libyan capital of Tripoli 
this morning after receiving an invitation from Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi following her repeated appeals to locate her 
missing husband. 
  Our correspondent in Paris, Rula al-Zayn, met al-'Umari and 
had this conversation with her before she left for the Libyan 
capital. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] Two weeks ago, I received and 
accepted an invitation after talking to the French lawyer Michel 
Juber, who advised me to accept the invitation. Mr. 
al-Qadhdhafi will do his best, he promised me in his recent 
letters, to look for my husband, who is a Libyan citizen. 
  [Al-Zayn] Have the Egyptian authorities answered your 
questions on the circumstances of the abduction? 
  [Al-'Umari] The Egyptian authorities initially acknowledged 
that Mansur was abducted, which is a known fact because he was 
attending an official conference. Afterward, they never talked 
about the incident. On the contrary, President Mubarak tried, 
as they say, to absolve himself of responsibility. From the 
legal point of view, since he was abducted from Cairo, Egypt is 
the prime responsible party to me and to the world. 
  I wrote to ministers and French President Mitterrand and 
received a reply from Foreign minister Alain Juppe. A week ago, 
I received another message from Alain Juppe and President 
Clinton. In his message, President Clinton told me that they 
will not fail to pressure Egypt to discover the obscure facts.

  [Text] Algiers, June 16 (MAP)--Algerian Foreign Minister 
Mohamed Salah Dembri confirmed Wednesday that his latest remarks 
about the Sahara issue were not "personal". 
  Dembri had told Moroccan daily "L'OPINION" that a "political 
solution" to the Sahara issue within a Moroccan framework was 
possible without the referendum. 
  In a clarification statement to Algerian "EL MOUDJAHID" 
governmental daily, Dembri said the idea was not his and it was 
among the ideas raised in 1983 by "top Moroccan political 
personalities" and namely "the stamp and flag" formula. 
  "What was valid earlier can be accepted today", said head of 
the Algerian diplomacy, adding that several proposals were made 
including the idea of an international conference proposed again 
by Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organisation of 
African Unity at the OAU summit of Tunis. 
  After recalling the difficulties facing the referendum, 
Dembri said it is possible that the referendum will confirm 
after all a political accord and stressed the need to give way 
to politic and diplomatic initiatives to get out of the impasse. 
  For Moroccan daily "L'OPINION", mouthpiece of the Istiqlal 
party, said Wednesday Algeria speaks a double language and 
wondered what Algeria really wants in the Sahara issue a 
"political solution" or the referendum.

  [Excerpts] Tyrant Saddam's authorities have declared a 
state of emergency in the (?west) of al-Nasiriyah Governorate in 
southern Iraq following an attack by one the Islamic resistance 
forces mujahidin on the command headquarters of [words 
indistinct] on 3 June. Scores of officers and men of the 
tyrant's forces were killed and wounded and [words indistinct]. 
  Reporting this from southern Iraq, our sources said the 
authorities intensified the presence of their forces in 
al-Nasiriyah and nearby cities and villages in the marshlands in 
an attempt to isolate the city center from surrounding areas. 
The sources added that the authorities imposed a three-day 
curfew on the city center and main streets where the regime's 
departments and [word indistinct] and security agencies are 
located. [passage omitted] 
  The sources said the security and intelligence agencies, the 
ruling party services, and emergency forces launched an 
extensive campaign of arrests in which a large number of 
citizens in al-Nasiriyah and its suburbs were arrested. 
[passage omitted] 
  In a later report from southern Iraq, our sources affirmed 
that security conditions in al-Nasiriyah Governorate have 
worsened. They said residents of that rebellious governorate 
are defying the regime's measures and that many incidents 
occurred during which clashes happened between angry citizens 
and the regime forces resulting in deaths and injuries on both 
sides. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Discussion between anchor Hayim Yavin and party affairs </F>
correspondent Menashe Raz in the Tel Aviv studio -- live] 
  [Text] [Yavin] Several weeks ago, Likud Chairman Binyamin 
Netanyahu met with Jordanian Crown Prince Hasan in London. What 
were the circumstances of the meeting? Who initiated it? 
  [Raz] In fact, the meeting was initiated by both sides. It 
took place following several meetings and discussions, which 
culminated in the idea of getting Likud Chairman Netanyahu and 
Prince Hasan together. 
  [Yavin] Where was the meeting held? 
  [Raz] It took place at a private residence in London in 
early May. Netanyahu left Israel and returned on the same day. 
The meeting lasted several hours. In the meeting, Netanyahu 
made it clear to Prince Hasan that the Likud supports the 
government's policy regarding a peace agreement with Jordan. 
The Likud has no problem with a peace arrangement between 
Israel and Jordan. After he returned to Israel, Netanyahu 
briefed Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on the meeting. 
  [Yavin] Has Netanyahu confirmed the report? 
  [Raz] No. He refused to discuss the issue and, in fact, has 
neither denied nor confirmed the report. 
  [Yavin] Nonetheless, by holding the meeting and making it 
public, Netanyahu is making a statement, is he not? 
  [Raz] Yes. I would say that Netanyahu is seeking to 
somewhat improve his image. On the local political map, he is 
considered a hawkish rightist. He hopes to convey the message: 
If and when I become Israeli prime minister, I will work more 
along the central lines of the Israeli political map. Netanyahu 
is also trying to deliver a message on the domestic level. He 
wants to appear as if he is representing the state. To date, he 
has been an outspoken critic of the government's peace policy. 
Quite a few of his associates have told him that he should seek 
some way to somehow support some component of the peace process. 
At the time, they discussed possible Likud support for the 
agreement on Gaza; however, as will be recalled, after the Oslo 
agreement was signed, Netanyahu attacked the entire agreement. 
Therefore, I assume that one of the main motivations for this 
meeting was an attempt to show his domestic audience that he is 
acting like a statesman. 
  [Yavin] You said that Netanyahu briefed the prime minister. 
Did he also brief the Likud members? 
  [Raz] The only ones in the Likud who know of it are the very 
few who were involved in the contacts prior to the meeting, as 
well as several to whom he reported about it.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jordan Will Not Participate in </F>
Military Committee; It Is Willing To Mediate in Yemen at an Arab 
Request"] 
  [Excerpt] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior Jordanian 
official yesterday ruled out Jordan's willingness to participate 
in a military committee to settle the dispute in Yemen, as 
proposed by Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, 
during his talks with Jordanian officials yesterday. 
  The Jordanian official, who asked to remain anonymous, said 
that Jordan participated with the Sultanate of Oman in a 
military mission which worked -- after the signing of the Pledge 
and Accord Document and until the fighting broke out -- to spare 
blood and disengage the military sectors which were the source 
of tension. He added, "regrettably, recent developments and the 
large-scale explosion of the situation have in practice ended 
the military committee's role and led to the withdrawal of 
Jordanian and Omani officers." 
  The Jordanian official pointed out that Prime Minister Dr. 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali has on several occasions said that 
Jordan will not resume mediation efforts except with the 
unanimous approval of all the parties to the dispute, and it 
will not respond to the request of just one party. 
  He said that Jordan intervened to resolve the Yemeni crisis 
and tried to defuse the situation early at an official request 
from the legislative and executive authorities. But we now 
prefer to wait until Lakhdar Brahimi completes his noble 
mission, as he is expected to submit his report to the UN 
secretary general and the UN Security Council. The fate of 
regional and international mediations will be determined in the 
light of that. 
  The Jordanian official did not rule out Jordan's 
participation in any mediation efforts, provided they are at an 
official request from the parties to the dispute or an Arab 
request. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article by 'Imad Fawzi Shu'aybi: "An Open Letter to </F>
Christopher: Seizing the Opportunity Before It Is Too Late and 
Referring to al-Asad's Political Encyclopedia"] 
  [Text] It seems to me that the U.S. policy has not fallen 
into such a great contradiction between its private interests 
and personal dispositions on the one hand and its decisions, 
measures, and political approach on the other, as it has with 
Syria. This is clearly and blatantly apparent in the nature of 
the U.S. approach to the Syrian track and the measures America 
is taking regarding Syria. 
  We know that it was President Clinton's serious reading of 
the State Department's reports that prompted him to hold the 
Geneva summit and led him to say objectively that he had heard a 
lot about President al-Asad. However, he was surprised to find 
that reality was far richer than what was said or written, that 
President al-Asad was surely a leader of peace, and that he 
learned a lot from him. This seems to indicate that it was that 
stand which subjected the United States of America, represented 
by its president, to a major campaign from within. Prior to the 
Geneva summit we warned that America and Syria would come under 
enormous pressure. We showed the conflicts raging among the 
U.S. establishments, primarily the Defense Department and the 
decision-making organs, to break free of the cold war mentality 
that predominates in the Pentagon and to counter the influence 
of the Zionist lobby, which uses rumors to exert pressure. 
  Although Syria has succeeded in surviving this game and 
understanding its dimensions, it seems that the U.S. 
Administration was only able to curb the pressures on it by 
taking two steps backward and turning Warren Christopher's visit 
to the region into a mere postman's task. 
  Serious studies by U.S. political advisers at the highest 
levels, like that conducted by Anthony Lake, the U.S. 
President's adviser for national security, underline Syria's 
importance. Lake emphasized the importance of reaching a 
comprehensive solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, 
particularly between Syria and Israel, in order to consolidate 
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement and strengthen the moderates 
in the Middle East. He said that Syria plays a crucial role in 
the regional peace process and that its past alliance with Iran 
and its support for (rejectionists) have given the powers of 
(extremism) a vital foundation in the Middle East. [parentheses 
as published] Washington, therefore, insists that peace should 
be real, safe, and comprehensive. 
  Without going into an argument about what Lake terms 
"extremism," we can say that the U.S. Administration has 
realized Syria's importance. However, due to electoral 
considerations, it has little influence in the face of Israeli 
pressures. Hence, we address our words to U.S. Secretary 
Christopher and to whom it may concern in the U.S. 
Administration. You are favoring the direct over the indirect 
[not further specified]. The U.S. secretary must refer to the 
ABC's of politics to understand how to deal simultaneously with 
Israel and Syria. If the sources of the State Department and 
think tanks are incapable of giving the U.S. secretary true 
advice in politics, we will provide these lessons: 
  1. The American and Israeli electoral game is approaching. 
The keys to this game are in Damascus. Unless they hurry up 
and make some progress with the peace process, President Clinton 
in particular will be in trouble. Moreover, the [Israeli] Labor 
Party will not find the necessary assets to run in the coming 
elections. Syria alone can frustrate all that has been achieved 
so far in the peace process. In other words, each side has only 
six months to bolster its position if Syria's lawful demands in 
the peace process are met. 
  2. To understand the Syrian policy fully, it should be 
realized that it does not play around, that it is capable of 
making its own choices, and that it can considerably upset the 
balance of the negotiating powers with its rational silence and 
relentless action. Nothing proves that better than the fact that 
the Russian giant has found no other gateway but Syria to enter 
the region, force itself on the world once again, and reshape 
its new image at the NATO negotiations. 
  When this giant writes off 90 percent of the debts Syria 
owes to the former Soviet Union and conducts several trips to 
Syria--three visits in one and a half months--it is enough for 
everyone to realize that Syria's weight is far greater than they 
imagined. 
  Israel's unserious approach to its proposals, which makes 
the 
U.S. secretary of state no better than a postman, must end 
quickly; otherwise the wasted time will not be in the interest 
of the United States and Israel. 
  3. The U.S. secretary must carefully read his department's 
files and specialized books about President al-Asad, because on 
this depends the U.S. policy's ability to find sound measures to 
facilitate the negotiating process so that no one, including the 
United States itself, will miss the opportunity. 
  Hence, we say that Syria is not negotiating from a weak 
position; it is known that President al-Asad does not negotiate 
from weak positions. When he negotiates from a strong position, 
he does not back down and he has the nerve and the political 
strength to play out the negotiations down to the last quarter 
hour. His briefing papers are not shown to anyone and he is 
able to create unexpected situations and stands. When he is in 
the right, he does not bargain; this is not a slogan for media 
hype. It is a fact, the bitterness of which has been tasted by 
many, such as the Israelis in several places, the Americans in 
Lebanon, [former Lebanese army general] 'Awn in his political 
vainglory--the list is endless. 
  Therefore, wasting time in what some imagine is a political 
bazaar might undermine the entire peace process, because rights 
are not subject to political haggling. Had al-Asad been the 
type who engages in political haggling over rights, he would 
have taken back the whole Golan over 20 years ago. But he 
negotiates only what should be negotiated; this means that 
President al-Asad does not negotiate over themes and substantive 
issues, only over procedures. It also means that the frantic 
political bazaar won't find attentive ears in Damascus except on 
procedural details. 
  Hafiz al-Asad sells but doesn't buy, listens but doesn't 
bargain. He doesn't buy the words of those who negotiate with 
him, because what al-Asad has means he does not need what the 
others might give. He fully realizes that time is on his side 
and that Rabin's latest proposals are indicative of this because 
it was Rabin who flinched first in this game of chicken. He 
initiated the campaign, so he should stay until the end. 
Al-Asad also realizes that stalling might--or rather will--turn 
the tables on the others. 
  Al-Asad is willing to negotiate endlessly without 
relinquishing his rights; and he knows pretty well that nothing 
will happen in the region without his approval. 
  Peace is not merely a matter of trivial accords like those 
some people have accepted. Peace in the region passes only 
through Syria. All regional cooperation is geographically 
dependent on Syria and every accord on water can only pass 
through Syria. As for an agreement on nonproliferation of 
weapons of mass destruction, its key lies in Damascus. 
  No matter how events shape up, everyone has to refer to 
Syria 
and to President al-Asad himself. Hence, any delay or 
maneuvering will only benefit Syria. Perhaps it would be useful 
for Mr. Christopher to refer to President al-Asad's biography to 
realize who he is negotiating with. 
  He alone stands out among leaders of the Arab region and the 
Third Word as one who constitutes a departure [mufaraqah] from 
U.S. policy. He is rejected because he is an opposer, he is 
acceptable because he is a skilled politician, he is 
unacceptable because he does not agree with others' policies, 
and he is acceptable because he is a man of politics not 
adventures. He stands out alone among other leaders as being 
both an adversary and an arbiter and also someone for whom they 
are compelled to announce their respect. 
  Thus, in a clever and shrewd move, President al-Asad was 
able to establish a political reference for his archenemies and 
his fiercest foes. He is the only one who plays the game of 
"political options," does not put all his eggs in one basket, 
and does not give in to whatever the political circumstances 
impose on him. He believes in creating options and forcing 
static conditions to move by singing the same tune, but in a 
tempo he himself dictates. 
  Turning your back on existing realities means presenting 
your 
back to others as a target, while accepting existing realities 
means submitting to whatever happens so that you end up as 
fertilizer for the history of others. Hafiz al-Asad was able to 
recognize the existing realities, but he did not surrender to 
them. He continued his efforts to make energize the static 
conditions, and he has tried to use these fluid conditions to 
promote his policies. Through their movement he was able to 
seize suitable opportunities to rearrange matters and to change 
these conditions. 
  No man has witnessed such great changes in his time as 
President al-Asad has. He has been a man of war and a man of 
peace; a man of the cold war and a man of the new world order. 
The man soon adapted to the changing circumstances, planned his 
policy carefully, and made himself felt on the world stage at a 
time when everyone else was shaking their heads and accepting 
whatever came their way. 
  He contends with bad circumstances, but is not overbearing. 
He influences them, but is not influenced by them. Everyone 
has recognized his shrewdness. Kissinger wished he could become 
his foreign minister. On the eve of the departure of the 
American forces from Lebanon in the mid-80's, a senior 
correspondent said that the one who resides in the White House, 
governs the biggest power in the world, but he cannot deter the 
resident of al- Muhajirin, who governs a country with a small 
population and few resources; he does not deserve his position, 
for al-Asad's position is in the White House. James Baker 
emerged from a diplomatic shuttle before the Madrid Conference 
amazed at the Steel-nerved man he had met. Last but not least, 
Clinton's remarks about al-Asad's capabilities, the need for him 
to assume a basic leading role in the Middle East peace process, 
and his recognition that Syria is the key to a solution was not 
flattery. His remarks were in the nature of things, in view of 
al-Asad's political importance. As the saying goes, what is 
correct will ultimately make itself known. 
  President al-Asad is known to be a master in discriminating 
between strategy and tactics. He is skillful in the only thing 
that determines who is a professional and who is an amateur 
politician-- the art of choosing the appropriate moment. He 
knows how to ride the waves, and by the time the waves start to 
recede he has already left the beach for good. He is a man of 
nerves of the first degree. He takes the one with whom he is 
negotiating to the bottom of the pit, and at the appropriate 
moment he emerges with a secure position while the nerves of 
everyone else have broken down. Therefore, everyone must 
realize that they are negotiating with the eleventh- hour man, 
who does not hasten anything nor beg for anything, but lets time 
takes its course. He is persistent and is never tired of 
details. He discusses in depth every minor or major point. 
This man is now dealing with Rabin over the history of the 
Labor Party and Labor Party's chances remaining in control of 
the government. Realizing that everyone awaits his decision, he 
is able to take from them what he did not take from others and 
what they could not take from him. Therefore, Rabin will get 
tired, but al-Asad will not. 
  What everyone who has an interest in peace must realize is 
that President al-Asad will not be trapped by their schemes, for 
he knows how to make hard choices and how to go to the brink of 
danger then withdraw quietly, leaving everybody in wonder. 
Accordingly, he has mastered the art of attack and retreat, and 
combines political and military actions. When he senses the 
dangers of direct military action he is the first, and perhaps 
the last, to resort to indirect military action--or what is 
known as acting by remote control--which enables him to exercise 
military command in a unique and effective way. He does not 
resort to outmoded methods of military action, for he supports 
institutions and organizations that have national legitimacy and 
rights recognized under international law. Thus, he wagers on 
peace, but he does not rule out the chances of war. In the 
welter of political negotiations, his military arsenal abounds 
with extra resources that make war an extension of politics and 
deterrence effective and a first-class negotiating card. He is 
a cautious negotiator who arms himself quietly without indulging 
in small-time showing off. 
  He will exhaust many people, who stand no chance of 
obtaining 
from him anything that he has not already made up his mind to 
give. His negotiating skill features an enormous capability for 
endurance and an ideological encyclopedia about rights 
throughout history. It is also known that al-Asad links his 
personal dignity to the national dignity. As precious as 
personal and national dignity are in the East, the legacy of the 
relationship with the land is equally rich. For Easterners in 
general and Arabs in particular, land is honor. For al-Asad, 
negotiations means "either all one's rights or nothing." Either 
full rights or let the conflict continue for hundreds of years, 
for history does not belong to one individual. Therefore, by 
demanding all his rights he is defending history. He is a man 
whose buttress, like the Great Wall of China, cannot be 
penetrated. But if some people want to advance negotiations 
with him, they have to come up with serious initiatives from the 
start. 
  At any rate, it is no secret that he is agreeable to 
obtaining full rights in stages, but only in installments that 
suit him and that may not necessarily suit others. Accordingly, 
President al- Asad accepts a timetable for withdrawal from the 
Golan, but he does not accept a phased and unspecified 
withdrawal. Thus, we can reiterate here that what is acceptable 
regarding the Golan is "all or nothing." Therefore, if the 
Israelis like to play for time, let them try it, and we promise 
them a sure loss against President Hafiz al-Asad. Likewise, if 
some Americans try to manipulate the two sides of the U.S. 
Administration--meaning the State Department led by Warren 
Christopher and President Clinton personally--they will lose and 
put the future of U.S. relations in the region in great 
jeopardy, for all the keys are in the hands of Damascus. It is 
high time the Americans realized where their interests lie and 
learned not to sacrifice them at the altars of old and inherited 
policies that time has passed by. 
  Until the eleventh hour comes, we tell everybody: Seize the 
opportunity before you start to pay for not grasping it. 
Political reason dictates that you say a positive word in a 
world that is changing. Syria is the gateway to the Middle 
East. Syria has paid dearly for a policy that has lasted for 50 
years, during which it has become the region's axis. Some 
people have attempted to marginalize Syria's policy but they 
lost, as did the region and the world. Thus, admitting Syria's 
pivotal and premier weight in the entire Middle East is the only 
key to lasting stability in the region. We believe that it is 
high time that the U.S. Administration realizes that Israel's 
weight cannot be equated with Syria's regional weight.

<F P=106> [Reports by Kamal Hamid in Khartoum and Nizar Daww-al-Na'im </F>
in London: "Garang Announces Formation of Executive Council To 
Run the `Liberated Areas'; Al-Bashir: Washington Deals With Us 
Positively for the First Time"] 
  [Excerpts] Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
Special Envoy Melissa Wells' visit to Sudan, Sudanese President 
'Umar al-Bashir said that "for the first time, the White House 
is dealing with Sudan directly and positively." 
  Meanwhile, Colonel John Garang, leader of the Sudanese 
People's Liberation Movement [SPLM], has announced the formation 
of a "National Executive Council" which has 27 members and has 
the task of running the areas under SPLM control in the south of 
the country. 
  Al-Bashir described Wells' visit, which was concluded 
yesterday, as "evidence of U.S. President Bill Clinton's special 
interest in what happens in Sudan." He added in press 
statements during his weekly meeting with the media that 
"Washington is dealing with Khartoum positively for the first 
time." [passage omitted] 
  Minister of State for Presidential Affairs Dr. Ghazi 
Salah-al-Din has told AL-HAYAH that "Wells explained her mission 
of boosting the peace efforts and ensuring relief for the 
victims of the civil war, but she did not broach relations 
between the two countries." But Salah-al-Din, who held a long 
meeting with the U.S. envoy, said that "some other points over 
which the United States had been critical of the government" 
were also raised. 
  He saw the visit as "a new development in relations between 
the two countries replacing the policy of attack, accusation, 
and pursuit we felt in the past." 
  Meanwhile, SPLM sources have stated that the new 27-member 
"National Executive Council" has been entrusted with "the role 
of actual civilian authority in the areas under SPLM control." 
They added that the announcement of the council marked the 
beginning of changes "which are fundamental in the context of 
the New Sudan" declared by the SPLM's first conference last 
March. 
  They added that the Council will administer "the liberated 
areas." Garang kept the defense portfolio for himself in 
addition to the chairmanship of the council. Commander Silva 
Kir, his deputy, got the foreign and interior portfolios, Deng 
Alore the state's affairs portfolio, Dr. Justin Yak the health 
portfolio, Commander Yusuf Kuwa the affairs of Kurdufan 
(district), Daniel Kudi environment and tourism affairs, 
Laurence Wall education affairs, Arthur Queen human affairs, and 
Dr. Peter Nute Cole legal affairs [names as transliterated]. 
Five governors were also appointed for the provinces of 
Kurdufan, Upper Nile, Equatoria, Bahr al-Ghazal, and Blue Nile.

  [Text] Many tense observers of the Yemeni war do not want 
to consider reality. They are ignoring the objective facts that 
put this war in its correct perspective and uncover the culprits 
who led Yemen to this disaster. 
  Cards and whims have been confused and the only tune that is 
heard is the tune of secession fed by those who urge a halt to 
the fighting in order to entrench a dreadful reality as though 
the only way to salvage Yemen is to slay and dismember it. 
  The claim that there is a war between the north and the 
south 
is not supported by the facts on the ground. On the contrary, 
the fasts point out that Yemen, south and north, is waging war 
against a misguided group that does not represent the south but 
is controlling its fate and imposing on its children a stand 
that does not conform to their interests and convictions. A 
glance at the names of the military commanders who are leading 
the forces that are advancing to defeat the secession confirms 
that the vast majority of the south rejects the adventure, or 
rather the plot, of secession which seeks to cancel the idea of 
unity and obliterate the last hope of restoring factors of Arab 
existence in the face of a bigger plot that aims to usurp Arab 
land, resources, identity, and history from Arab sovereignty. 
  In a field count of the southern military commanders who are 
waging the battle of defending the honor of belonging to a 
unified Yemen, we read the following names: Defense Minister 
Brigadier General 'Abd-Rabbuh Hadi Mansur, central axis 
commander Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, eastern front 
commander Colonel Ahmad Musa'id Husayn, Colonel 'Abdallah 
Mansur, Colonel Salim 'Ali Qutun, Colonel Muhammad Tumays, 
Colonel Salih Ahmad al-Harithi, Colonel Ahmad 'Ali Muhsin, and 
Colonel Ahmad al-'Akrub. All of these are from the southern 
governorates, joined by tribal men from Shabwah and Abyan 
governorates. Indeed, some of the military forces that were 
fighting within the southern ranks joined the northern forces 
when the Socialist Party revealed its intentions and declared 
secession. 
  Does not all this reveal the facts of the Yemeni events and 
uncover the falseness of the secession which fell at home before 
reinforcements came from abroad?

  [Text] Vienna, June 16 (AFP) -- OPEC ministers struggled 
here Thursday [16 June] to break a political deadlock over the 
choice of a successor to outgoing OPEC Secretary General Subroto 
of Indonesia. 
  The front-running candidate for the office is former 
Venezuelan oil minister Alirio Parra, said to have the support 
of most of the 12 member countries of the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). 
  But Iran has proposed its current ambassador in Tokyo, 
Hoseyn 
Kazempur-Ardabili, a veteran OPEC delegate. 
  Iran's oil minister, Gholam Reza Aqazadeh-Kho'i, made it 
clear Wednesday he was maintaining Kazempor's candidacy, 
blocking a consensus in favour of Parra, and told reporters 
early Thursday he had "not changed" his position. 
  According to OPEC's statutes, the organization's top 
executive officer is appointed by unanimous decision of the OPEC 
conference for a period of three years that can be renewed only 
once. 
  Subroto, aged 66, a veteran Indonesian official who served 
for 10 years as Indonesia's mining and energy minister until he 
was named head of the OPEC secretariat in 1988, will be 
completing his second term by the end of June. 
  Some delegations were said to favour extending his 
appointment for six months as an interim solution, to give OPEC 
members time to sort out the problem by the time of their 
year-end conference scheduled to open here on November 16. 
  Another provisional solution mooted would provide for the 
current OPEC President, Libya's Oil Minister 'Abdallah Salim 
al-Badri to "supervise" the operations of the Vienna-based 
secretariat in cooperation with OPEC's Iraqi Deputy Secretary 
General, Ramzi Salman. 
  However, Kuwait made it clear at one point Thursday it would 
suspend any relations with OPEC if day-to-day operations at OPEC 
headquarters were left in the hands of an Iraqi national. 
  Conference sources meanwhile claimed Aqazadeh had been 
rebuffed by key members, including Saudi Arabia, when reportedly 
seeking guarantees that an Iranian would be appointed three 
years from now if Iran withdrew its present candidate to make 
way for Parra. 
  Under the statutes, the secretary general may be picked "on 
a 
rotational basis" for a two-year term, if a unanimous decision 
cannot be obtained. This happened frequently in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s, but then resulted in a stalemate because of the 
Iran- Iraq war. 
  When Marc Nan Nguema of Gabon left office in mid-1983, an 
Iranian was next in line, but his appointment was blocked by 
Iraq and its Arab neighbours. 
  As a consequence, then Deputy Secretary General Fadhil al- 
Chalabi, who happened to be an Iraqi, was left in charge of the 
secretariat until Subroto's appointment in June, 1988. 
  The choice of a new OPEC chief executive officer was the 
final point on the agenda of the ministers' mid-year meeting 
which opened here Wednesday. 
  They cleared their main business late Wednesday by agreeing 
to leave OPEC's overall oil production ceiling unchanged to 
year-end and to avoid any ministerial meetings before the next 
regular conference set for November 16. 
  The ministers reckon that this will encourage the recent 
uptrend in oil prices, since demand is expected to firm up 
towards the end of the year as economic recovery gains ground in 
industrial nations. 
  "Doing nothing may sometimes do the trick," a delegate 
commented. 
  Oil futures soared in New York after the ministers' decision 
late Wednesday, hitting a 12-month high of 19.86 dollars a 
barrel for the American benchmark light crude, WTI. But 
analysts here said this was mainly due to factors which had no 
bearing on the outcome of the OPEC talks. 
  In London, North Sea Brent prices at two months broke up 
through the 17-dollar mark early Thursday afternoon, as crude 
for August delivery briefly reached 17.04 dollars a barrel 
before stabilizing at 17.02, compared with 16.94 dollars at the 
Wednesday close.

  [Text] Tunis, June 16 (AFP) -- PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
will make his long-awaited visit to Gaza and Jericho within the 
next week, but it will only be for a short stay, Palestinian and 
diplomatic sources said Thursday. 
  'Arafat will visit the newly-autonomous areas for three days 
but will spend every night in Amman according to the plans being 
laid, the sources said. No precise date is yet known. 
  Contradictory rumours have been circulating for weeks about 
when the PLO chief intends to make his triumphant entry into 
Jericho. But preparations have been going on nonetheless to 
hand over control of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to the new 
Palestinian Authority. 
  'Arafat is due to return for good to Jericho, but has said 
he 
did not want to make the trip until donor countries had 
fulfilled pledges to help fund Palestinian self-rule. 
  Israeli and Palestinian leaders have been issuing various 
dates for his return for months. On Sunday the PLO's former 
negotiator Nabil Sha'th said 'Arafat would arrive within two 
weeks. Sha'th himself entered the Gaza Strip on Tuesday after 
spending most of his life in exile. 
  PLO officials said Sha'th would prepare for 'Arafat's 
arrival 
either later this month or in early July.

  [Text] President Hashemi-Rafsanjani participated in a TV 
satellite interview with participants of the Swiss-based 
International Crans Montana Forum at 1630 GMT Thursday. 
  In the direct satellite link, held at the request of forum 
participants and broadcast simultaneously to 35 countries and 
translated into five languages: English, French, Spanish, German 
and Italian, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani spoke about economics, 
politics, Iranian foreign relations, and other general issues of 
interest. 
  He referred to Iranian policy regarding its neighbors as a 
peaceful and friendly policy. With respect to events in 
northern Iraq, responding to a question by former French Foreign 
Minister Dumas, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: we respect Iraq's 
territorial integrity and see the Kurds living in Turkey and 
Iraq as members of these countries whose interests should be 
noted. 
  Advising Russia not to interfere in the newly independent 
Central Asian countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: Unfortunately, 
differences have arisen in these countries. Our policy is to 
solve these differences. 
  Referring to the tragic state of affairs in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and emphasizing that the present condition 
must change, the president said: The hands of the majority of 
the people of this country have been tied but a minority allowed 
to commit aggression. 
  Addressing the participants, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: If you 
and others feel unable to end the war in Bosnia you should allow 
the innocent Muslims to have defense capabilities. 
  The president added: Iran is prepared to dispatch its peace 
keeping forces to Bosnia within the context of the United 
Nations. 
  In another part of the interview, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said 
the 
expansion of Franco-Iranian depends on policies of Paris. He 
added: If our friends in France try to free themselves from the 
effects of fabricated propaganda bilateral relations will expand 
easily. 
  Commenting on events in Algeria, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred 
to the victory of Muslims in the elections and said: The vote of 
the majority was not respected. We are surprised that the 
supporters and champions of human rights fail to take note. 
  Hashemi-Rafsanjani emphasized: The Islamic Republic of Iran 
has been blamed regarding events in Algeria only because it has 
spoken its views without hindrance.

  [Excerpt] Foreign Affairs Minister Velayati addressed a 
session of the international seminar of the Forum Foundation in 
Switzerland. Today was designated as the Islamic Republic of 
Iran Day. He spoke on recent progress in the Islamic Republic 
of Iran during the past 15 years and its future development 
plans. He said: Unfortunately malicious propaganda has 
prevented world public opinion to fully understand the realities 
about the Iranian society and the position of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's system and the long strides it has taken to 
revive democracy in the country and establish stability and 
security in the region. 
  Velayati referred to the special geographical and political 
position of Iran and its active role in the establishment of 
regional security and stability and its assistance to resolve 
regional and international crises. He said: The great 
self-sacrifice of the Iranian nation in that regard, 
particularly in accepting 4 million refugees from various 
countries, has been ignored by the world community. 
  He elaborated on the Islamic Republic of Iran's stances on 
regional and international political issues and said such 
stances were adopted to reduce the arms race and safeguard the 
soundness and security of oil exports and create mutual trust 
among regional states. 
  Velayati also expressed the readiness of our country for the 
active participation of our country in a comprehensive 
initiative to reduce the production and transfer of weapons to 
the Middle East. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Baroda, June 1, The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] 
today countered the Prime Ministers "posture" on the issue of 
nuclear option and asserted that India ought to declare itself 
as a "nuclear weapon state". 
  BJP president L.K. Advani as well as senior leader A.B. 
Vajpayee said that while the BJP was all for de-nuclearisation 
and disarmament the most question was whether this was happening 
anywhere. 
  "China", Mr Vajpayee said, "has just tested another nuclear 
device" Iran is on the threshold of the bomb while Pakistan is 
widely believed to have already made the bomb. 
  "So, where is the de nuclearisation?" Mr Vajpayee said and 
added: "We can also destroy the bomb. But first we have to make 
one. We should declare that we are a nuclear weapon state. That 
declaration itself would suffice." 
  Mr Advani, while talking to news men, said he for one was 
amused by the Prime Minister's reported remark that the BJP was 
resorting to one-upmanship on the nuclear option issue. "I would 
say that it is the Prime Minister who is indulging in 
one-upmanship by saying that his Government has kept the nuclear 
option open." 
  The BJP, Mr Advani said, ha been a consistent advocate of 
India going nuclear. An additional argument in support of this 
view now stemmed from the sort of attitude being adopted by the 
US after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its emergence as 
the only superpower. 
  Mr Vajpayee, touching upon the PM's remarks while delivering 
his own valedictory address at the BJP session, said it would 
not suffice for the Prime Minister to say that the nuclear 
option has been kept open. "You have to move further," he said. 
  Indiscipline flayed: Mr Vajpayee highlighted the need for 
the 
party to take all sections alone in its onward march. He also 
called upon partymen to live up to the party's image by making a 
break with factionalism and indiscipline. 
  In his customary session-end address, Mr Vajpayee told the 
National Council members that the contagion of factionalism and 
indiscipline widely prevalent in the other political parties was 
threatening the BJP as well. It was for partymen to see this 
danger. 
  Mr Vajpayee also spoke of the need for the Party to rise to 
the aspirations of Dalits. "In fact, the Dalits have started 
rallying behind the BJP in a big way. It is a good development 
but we are not even aware of it," he said, and called for Dalit 
conventions in the various States. 
  Mr Vajpayee came down heavily on anti-party activities being 
resorted to by some. The party should not condone this. No 
leniency should be showed to those who defy party discipline. 
  He also came down heavily on partymen jostling for position 
and power.

  [Excerpts] Concerning the international efforts to support 
the Middle East peace process, the proceedings of the fifth 
session of the multilateral working group, which has been 
charged within the framework of the Arab-Israeli conference with 
developing the countries of the Middle East region, continued 
this morning in Rabat. Like the previous proceedings, this 
session was held behind closed doors and lasted for more than 
five hours. [passage omitted] 
  The Palestinian delegation taking part in this session held 
a 
news conference today in which it gave an initial evaluation of 
the meeting, which is expected to conclude its proceedings this 
evening. Concerning the subjects discussed in this morning's 
meeting, (Muhammad Shitiyah), a member of the Palestinian 
delegation, said: 
  [Begin (Shitiyah) recording] We have listened to numerous 
reports dealing with different issues submitted by the 
sponsoring countries. In particular, we have listened to a 
report by the Spanish Government on the agricultural issue, from 
Japan on tourism in the region, a summary study from Germany on 
the issue of trade in the Middle East and its international 
ramifications, and also a report from the United States on the 
issue of training. We have also listened to a report from the 
Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, a committee for coordinating aid to 
the Palestinian people, which convened in Paris last week. 
There were also numerous interventions from the different 
sides. There was a proposal presented by the European 
Community. Basically, it requested that more weight be given to 
the Middle East region in determining its priorities, as we said 
yesterday. The proposal has been modified many times, and the 
international dimension was retained. [end recording]

  [Text] Tunis, Jun 16--The brother secretary of the General 
People's Committee for Foreign Liaison and International 
Cooperation has stressed the Great Jamahiriyah's appreciation 
for the great support it received from the heads of African 
states participating in the proceedings of the 30th OAU summit 
that ended in Tunis yesterday. 
  He referred to the two resolutions of the 60th session of 
the 
African states' foreign ministers and the 30th session of heads 
of African states, which both supported the Great Jamahiriyah's 
position in its crisis with the Western states. 
  The brother secretary said that the explicit support that we 
have received from this conference has made this crisis an 
African crisis, and he stressed the importance of the 
resolutions of the African summit, which represents the will of 
35 African states who are UN members. 
  He praised the efforts of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine 
Ben Ali and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, and their foreign 
ministers, in crystallizing the African stance on the crisis 
between the Great Jamahiriyah and the Western states. He called 
for work to continue to implement the resolution issued by the 
African summit in this regard. 
  The brother secretary of the General People's Committee for 
Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation stressed that the 
border problem between the Great Jamahiriyah and Chad had been 
solved once and for all, culminating in the signing of a pact of 
good neighborliness and cooperation between the two countries. 
  He explained that Libya was a country that respected the law 
and international laws, pointing out that the Great Jamahiriyah 
had undertaken to implement the ruling of the International 
Court of Justice regarding the Aouzou strip and to resolve its 
border problem with Chad. 
  He said that the Great Jamahiriyah had implemented a ruling 
of the International Court of Justice for the third time, which 
confirmed that Libya abided by the laws issued by the 
International Court of Justice. He pointed out that it was the 
great powers who refused to implement the decisions issued by 
such courts, observing that some of these states had broken 
international laws in the past and had failed to implement laws 
issued by the international body [words indistinct] that Libya 
knows who is above the law and who actually respects the law.

  [Text] Gaza, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the 
Palestinian delegation to the Palestinian-Israeli Liaison 
Committee, has announced that it has agreed in principle to 
begin negotiations on the establishment of autonomy over the 
remainder of the West Bank on Monday, 27 June. 
  After meeting for two hours today with Major General Amnon 
Shahaq, head of the Israeli delegation to the Liaison Committee, 
Sha'th said that they agreed to hold the meetings alternately in 
Gaza and Jerusalem. 
  Sha'th pointed out that the date of each of these meetings 
will be set after consultation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq. 
  Sha'th added that he and Shahaq also discussed problems 
connected to the application of autonomy such as travel permits 
for the Palestinians and resuming the talks about Palestinian 
detainees in Israeli jails. He explained that Israel has so far 
released only 1,200 detainees out of a total of 5,000 who should 
have been released in line with the agreement between the two 
sides. He said negotiations over the release of the others will 
be conducted during the next meeting with Shahaq. 
  Sha'th said he will meet in the near future with Israeli 
Police Affairs Minister Moshe Shahal to discuss the conditions 
of the detainees who have not yet been released. 
  The Palestinian official reported that Israel has approved 
the entry of the families of the Palestinian police, totaling 
50,000 people, and also approved the return of 72 other 
Palestinian families who until now have been residing in Rafah's 
Egyptian sector. They will move to the village of Tall 
al-Sultan in the Gaza Strip. 
  Amnon Shahaq announced that Dr. Sha'th does not intend to 
visit Jerusalem tomorrow because he will be occupied elsewhere. 
  Sha'th has asked that the number of Palestinian workers who 
work inside Israel be increased. Israel formerly suspended the 
work permits of approximately 130,000 workers, except 10,000 
workers from Gaza.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] In their discussions on the 
interim agreement for the West Bank, Israel and the PLO will 
discuss determining the municipal boundaries of Jerusalem, which 
will be outside the autonomy. Israel is demanding that the 
current municipal boundaries, determined in 1967, be maintained. 
In recent discussions in government forums, a proposal was made 
to ease the restrictions imposed on the entry of Palestinians 
from the West Bank into the city in return for a PLO agreement 
to make changes in the municipal boundaries in order to reduce 
friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem. 
  In a previous discussion on Jerusalem, held on 26 May, Prime 
Minister Rabin decided to prevent the establishment of new 
Palestinian political bodies and ban their policing activity in 
the city. 
  The prime minister instructed the Israel Police and the Shin 
Bet to closely monitor Orient House, the seat of the Palestinian 
delegation in East Jerusalem, and to immediately put an end to 
any illegal activity uncovered there. Over the past several 
days, security elements have reported that the preventive 
activity undertaken by the police and the Shin Bet regarding 
Orient House has led the Palestinians to "lower their profile" 
and curbed illegal activity in the building. [passage omitted] 
  In recent discussions between Police Minister Moshe Shahal 
and Faysal al-Husayni, the minister proposed that the parties 
draft a joint list of Palestinian institutions operating in East 
Jerusalem to serve as a basis for maintaining the status quo in 
the city, as promised by Israel in Foreign Minister Shim'on 
Peres' letter of 11 October 1993. Israel promised to protect 
the functioning of all the Palestinian institutions in the city.

  [Text] Israel's ambassador to the United States, Itamar 
Rabinovich, has warned Syria that the U.S. Administration will 
not in the future be as involved in the Middle East peace 
process as it is now. In an interview with Qol Yisra'el, 
Rabinovich -- who is also Israel's chief negotiator with 
Damascus -- urged Syria to seize the moment because the 
Americans will not continue to be interested in the process for 
an unlimited period of time. Rabinovich says he believes U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come again to the 
region in the coming weeks. 
  With regard to peace talks between Israel and Jordan, 
Rabinovich said he does not expect a breakthrough as a result of 
King Husayn's visit to Washington. 
  The next round of talks with Jordan is due to get under way 
at the beginning of July. This, according to government sources 
in Jerusalem quoted by the ITIM news agency.

<F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Eytan Rabin] </F>
  [Excerpt] Government elements have recently started 
drafting a detailed offer for an interim arrangement with 
Lebanon. The arrangement aims at attaining calm on the northern 
border, pulling the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] out of the 
security zone, and establishing security arrangements as a first 
stage toward signing a peace arrangement and normalizing the 
relations with Lebanon. 
  The offered arrangement will be based on the principles 
Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has set for the negotiations with 
Lebanon. Israel will demand that the military capability of 
Hizballah and other rejectionist fronts operating against it 
from Lebanon be disassembled; that the Lebanese Army be deployed 
in south Lebanon; and that its ability to impose order be tested 
over a period of six months, after which the IDF will withdraw 
from Lebanese territory. Security and coordination arrangements 
between the IDF and the Lebanese Army will also be introduced. 
Israel will also demand that Lebanon make a commitment to 
maintain the well-being of SLA [South Lebanese Army] men and 
other Lebanese who collaborated with Israel. 
  The offer formalized at this time includes an outline of the 
security arrangements that will prevail along the border and of 
the apparatuses that will supervise the agreement. Apparently, 
a UNIFIL [UN Interim Force in Lebanon] unit will remain in the 
area. Senior Israeli officials have said that making an interim 
agreement with Lebanon will only be possible if progress is made 
in the negotiations with Syria. Lebanon has rejected an Israeli 
offer to launch security talks at the level of army officers 
because Syria was opposed. 
  Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the 
United States and head of the delegation for talks with Syria, 
arrived in Israel over the weekend for his daughter's wedding. 
Last night he met with the prime minister and briefed him on 
the progress of the talks with Syria. 
  Discreet negotiations were held over the past several weeks 
between Rabinovich and the Syrian Ambassador in Washington Walid 
al-Mu'allim. Dennis Ross, head of the U.S. peace team, mediated 
by meeting each of the ambassadors separately. In the past, 
Rabinovich and al-Mu'allim held a series of secret meeting, but 
Israeli sources claim that they have not met for several weeks 
and only held indirect talks through the Americans. 
  A member of the U.S. peace team last week told WASHINGTON 
JEWISH WEEK that, despite the negative statements from Jerusalem 
and Damascus, constant progress is being made in the secret 
channel between them, and that it is possible that a joint 
declaration of principles toward peace will be signed by the end 
of this year. 
  Israeli officials confirmed the remarks, but said that the 
talks make "positive but insufficient progress." Rabinovich and 
al-Mu'allim are trying to bridge the gaps between the Israeli 
and Syrian stands and prepare for a visit here by U.S. Secretary 
of State Warren Christopher, but have not yet begun dealing with 
a detailed draft of a declaration of principles. Israeli 
sources said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad has not allowed 
al-Mu'allim to make much progress. According to them, the 
progress on the Jordanian track made the Syrians very angry and, 
over the past two weeks, they prevented progress. [passage

  [Text] Rabat, June 16 (MAP) -- The regional economic 
development working group stemming from the multilateral Middle 
East peace negotiations started the proceedings of its 5th 
session here Wednesday [15 June] in the presence of 46 
delegations. 
  The meeting, held for the first time in an Arab country, 
consecrates Morocco's active role in the promotion of peace in 
the Middle East. The previous meetings were held in Brussels, 
Rome, Copenhagen and Paris. 
  The Rabat meeting agenda highlights activities taken under 
the umbrella of the Copenhagen action plan which sets a work 
program in the short and medium term. 
  The meeting will examine the activities undertaken in 
several 
sectors since the last session and explore means of making 
further progress, said head of the delegation of the European 
Union which is chairing the 5th session Constantin Prevedorakis 
(Greece) in an opening statement. 
  He added that the session will also look into proposals for 
the monitoring of the action plan by the regional parties so 
that effective follow-up be assured and discuss guidelines for 
future activities in regional economic cooperation. 
  "The challenge we face is to lay a firm basis for the 
promotion of prosperity through regional cooperation in the 
Middle East", he said recalling that since its first session in 
1992, the group has made substantial progress in pursuing its 
principal immediate goals: Transforming ideas and initiatives 
into practical proposals, establishing priorities, creating a 
framework for regional economic cooperation and building 
confidence among the people of the region. 
  The Copenhagen action plan deals with 35 development 
projects 
mainly in the sectors of transport, communications, energy, 
tourism, agriculture, financial markets and investment, trade, 
electricity. The carrying out of each project is entrusted to a 
country or a financial institution such as the World Bank. 
  The head of the US delegation Daniel Kurtzer whose country 
is 
co- sponsoring along with Russia the negotiations process said 
the Copenhagen action plan proved to be an important milestone 
in the progression from a stage of planning and discussion to 
one of implementation. 
  However, in spite of these positive steps, we must assess 
our 
work to see if we are doing all that we can at this time to 
advance prospects for regional economic development and 
cooperation, the US delegate said. 
  He also called for further efforts to include Syria and 
Lebanon in this important work. The two Arab countries have 
been boycotting the group since its inception arguing that no 
progress can be made in the multilateral negotiations before a 
noteworthy progress in the Israeli-Arab bilateral negotiations. 
  The US delegate pointed out further that the group should 
examine how to address the needs of the private sector and take 
advantage of their energy to advance regional economic 
development. He also stressed the importance of the projected 
establishment of a comprehensive database for the working group 
as it will offer linkages to the academic community, research 
institutes and the private sector. 
  The participants in the meeting, he said, should consider 
what sort of organizational structure for the group will be 
required to develop these goals and priorities. "The regional 
parties will certainly have to play a major role in directing 
the process", he said adding that the US plans to announce a new 
initiative related to air transportation. 
  The head of the Japanese delegation echoed the US delegate 
stressing the need to involve the private sector wherever 
possible. Economic development is not only the greatest reward 
of peace but also most effectively strengthens peace, he said. 
  The Japanese delegate also stressed the importance of the 
participation of Syria and Lebanon saying this participation "is 
essential if regional cooperation is to be fully promoted on a 
regional scale". 
  The Jordanian delegate on his part stressed the need to 
consider financing requirements of priority projects and renewed 
the idea to establish a regional bank or fund to bankroll these 
projects. 
  "Another requirement to enhance regional cooperation is to 
resolve the debt problem facing some of the regional parties", 
he said. 
  The Chinese delegate pointed out that economic development 
in 
the region must be sustainable and steady and should benefit 
all. "It is therefore important to formulate long-term and 
phased development programs", he said before calling for 
increasing assistance to the areas under the Palestinian 
self-government and other territories still under occupation 
through bilateral or multilateral channels to enable an earlier 
start of the reconstruction of Palestine. 
  He equally stressed the need to establish as soon as 
possible 
a regional research body of economic experts to work out medium 
and long-term plans for regional economic cooperation and 
identify priority projects.

  [Excerpts] Concerning the international efforts to support 
the Middle East peace process, the proceedings of the fifth 
session of the multilateral working group, which has been 
charged within the framework of the Arab-Israeli conference with 
developing the countries of the Middle East region, continued 
this morning in Rabat. Like the previous proceedings, this 
session was held behind closed doors and lasted for more than 
five hours. [passage omitted] 
  The Palestinian delegation taking part in this session held 
a 
news conference today in which it gave an initial evaluation of 
the meeting, which is expected to conclude its proceedings this 
evening. Concerning the subjects discussed in this morning's 
meeting, Muhammad Ishtayyah, a member of the Palestinian 
delegation, said: 
  [Begin Ishtayyah recording] We have listened to numerous 
reports dealing with different issues submitted by the 
sponsoring countries. In particular, we have listened to a 
report by the Spanish Government on the agricultural issue, from 
Japan on tourism in the region, a summary study from Germany on 
the issue of trade in the Middle East and its international 
ramifications, and also a report from the United States on the 
issue of training. We have also listened to a report from the 
Ad Hoc Liaison Committee, a committee for coordinating aid to 
the Palestinian people, which convened in Paris last week. 
There were also numerous interventions from the different 
sides. There was a proposal presented by the European 
Community. Basically, it requested that more weight be given to 
the Middle East region in determining its priorities, as we said 
yesterday. The proposal has been modified many times, and the 
international dimension was retained. [end recording]

  [Text] The proceedings of the fifth session of the Middle 
East cooperation and economic development committee, which 
emanated from the multilateral talks, concluded today in Rabat. 
  Among the most important results of this session was the 
creation of a local committee at the regional level for 
coordination and follow up in the sphere of economic development. 
  [Begin recording] [Ra'uf Sa'id, member of Egyptian 
delegation] Among the most important results achieved in this 
meetings was that a decision was made for the first time on 
giving a principal role to the countries of the region, to the 
countries of the Middle East itself, to decide among themselves 
and by themselves the priorities which concern them on 
cooperation in the region, the ways for coordinating between 
these activities which take place in these spheres, and at the 
same ensuring the complete support of the international 
community. 
  Among the important results which have also been achieved is 
that there are important projects which would come closer to the 
implementation phases, i.e., transport projects in the Middle 
East, be it by road, railway, sea, or air. [end recording] 
  The Palestinian delegation expressed its satisfaction at the 
European proposal in a news conference which called for the 
creation of local committee at the regional level for 
coordination and cooperation in the development and economic 
sphere in the region. 
  [Begin recording] [Samir Halili, member of Palestinian 
delegation] All sides were determined to make this meeting 
successful, and determination for the existence and continuation 
of the international support for the Middle East peace process, 
and for the regional cooperation process. Everyone had the 
intention and determination to find a mechanism to support the 
multilateral talks and make it a vital and practical feature as 
soon as possible. 
  Morocco has had for a long time a principal role in the 
mediation and contacting between Israel, on the one hand, and 
the other Arab parties, on the other, especially Morocco's 
principal role in the issue of the Jerusalem committee, and also 
Morocco's principal role at the Arab Maghreb level. 
  In my view, the holding of the economic talks for the first 
time in the Arab World here in Morocco has great significance. 
According to what we have heard and according to our 
assessment, there would be a greater role for Morocco in the 
next phase in forming the peace process in the region, and in 
forming regional cooperation in the region. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Ahmad 'Ismat </F>
'Abd-al-Majid by Gudrun Harrer in Vienna; date not given: "`The 
War in Yemen Is Homemade'"] 
  [Text] [Harrer] In Vienna you signed an agreement between 
the Arab League and UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development 
Organization) on industrial cooperation. Is the Arab League now 
limiting its ambitions to the economic sphere after the 
permanent setbacks in the political sphere -- the Gulf War, the 
civil wars in Yemen, Sudan, and Somalia? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Our organization is, after all, an 
association of individual sovereign states, and we must not 
reduce this sovereignty in any way. Yes, there are joint 
political interests of the Arab states but, unfortunately, time 
and again there are also differing positions. Still, politics 
remains our main cause. 
  Yemen is certainly an example of misguided cooperation 
within 
the country. In my opinion certain elements have caused this 
fighting, for personal reasons and because of problems between 
individual parties. 
  [Harrer] Are you also thinking of groups outside Yemen, 
individual countries of the Arab League, to be more precisely -- 
such as Saudi Arabia, for whose interests Yemeni unity is 
running counter? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] No, in my opinion the war in Yemen is 
homemade. There was no need of outside intervention. Just 
think of the ideological differences between the Marxist south 
and the conservative north. Unity, which was concluded in 1990, 
was incomplete, there has never been just one army or a single 
currency. What unity is that? Not even a military or an 
economic one. 
  [Harrer] When all other Arab countries support Yemeni unity, 
why then has the Gulf Cooperation Council, which is actually 
nothing more than a regional cooperation forum within the 
League, in a statement de facto accepted the breaking off of 
South Yemen? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] No, that statement is not that clear. It 
was only meant to say that unity cannot be forced upon one 
partner, which is also my opinion. 
  [Harrer] So no war by proxy? Media reported that Iraqis 
were fighting on the side of North Yemen, whereas Saudi Arabia 
has old resentments against North Yemen not least from the time 
of the Gulf War. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I know nothing of Iraqis in North Yemen. 
No, this is certainly not the right approach to the Yemeni 
problem: First one has to stop fighting and then seek ways and 
means for reconciliation. 
  [Harrer] You have also repeatedly appealed for Arab-Arab 
reconciliation with Iraq. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I have never been under the illusion that 
the problems with Iraq could be solved overnight. What I wanted 
to say was that we finally have to face these problems and that 
we must learn from past mistakes. This also implies to admit to 
faults and responsibility. 
  I said very clearly that in the case of Iraq, the fault was 
its aggression against Kuwait. This now means: Implementing the 
UN resolutions, recognizing borders, compensation for victims. 
Iraq is about to fulfill the resolutions, but not all of them 
yet. 
  [Harrer] Is it justified to maintain the UN sanctions? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] I have personally repeatedly demanded to end 
the suffering of the Iraqi people, not for political but for 
humanitarian reasons. The quicker Iraq fulfills all the 
conditions, the quicker the sanctions will be lifted. 
  [Harrer] What is the Arab League's position on the progress 
in the Palestinian-Israeli agreements? Do you feel left out? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] One thing people tend to forget is that in 
September 1991 -- even before the Madrid conference, which was 
held in October, the Foreign Ministers' Council of the Arab 
League adopted a resolution with only two out of 21 votes 
against, that welcomed the peace process. As I said, that was 
before the Madrid Conference, which proves the will for peace on 
the part of the Arab countries. Yet, Israel can, of course, not 
have the cake and eat it: This means, peace for occupied 
territories. 
  [Harrer] One subject, which, among others, also applies to 
your home country, is radical Islamism. 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Islam does not tolerate violence and 
terrorism. Thus, Islamism must be seen as a social, political, 
and economic phenomenon, and radicalism of this sort exists in 
non-Islamic countries, too. In Egypt, the situation is 
meanwhile under control. 
  [Harrer] Is there no alternative to the very violent way in 
which the cause of Islamism is waged -- I am thinking of the 
many death sentences? 
  ['Abd-al-Majid] Each country has its own way of dealing with 
terrorism. Yet, why should we accept the killing of innocent 
people while the criminals then claim human rights for 
themselves? We must first of all think of the victims.

  [Text] Officials in south Yemen have asked the Arab League 
to keep up efforts on all levels to implement the League's 7 May 
resolution on the Yemeni crisis by enforcing an immediate 
cease-fire and starting a dialogue between the two sides. This 
came in a message the League received today. It was delivered 
by Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, member of the political bureau of 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP]. 
  Assistant Arab League Secretary General 'Adnan 'Imran told 
our correspondent that the League also received a copy of the 
message YSP Leader 'Ali Slaim al-Bid sent to UN Secretary 
General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, urging him to work toward an 
immediate cease-fire in implementation of UN Security Council 
Resolution 924. 
  'Imran added that the League is keeping up its good offices 
with the various Yemeni parties in the north and south, as well 
as with fraternal Arab states and the international community, 
to bring about a cease-fire. The League also wants to bring the 
two sides to the negotiating table to initiate a dialogue rather 
than fight. 
  He reiterated the League's stand on the Yemeni crisis and 
its 
call to end the fighting as soon as possible in order to enhance 
security and stability in Yemen.

  [Text] Nabil Sha'th has explained that his meeting with 
members of the Palestinian Authority [PA] scheduled for tomorrow 
at Orient House in East Jerusalem will be a reception and not a 
working session or an official meeting. He told our 
correspondent Moti Amir that he will confer with the PA members 
in Jericho this afternoon to brief them about his meeting with 
Major General Amnon Shahaq, during which he will discuss the 
continuation of the negotiations on the implementation of the 
autonomy agreements. Dr. Sha'th said that a reception, and not 
an official meeting, will be held for him at Orient House. He 
added that he will pray at al-Aqsa Mosque and visit churches in 
East Jerusalem tomorrow. 
  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert has called on the prime minister 
to take immediate action to thwart Sha'th's plans to visit 
Jerusalem. He told our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky that such a 
visit would constitute a violation of the autonomy agreements. 
  The National Religious Party [NRP] and Moledet have joined 
the call to prevent the PA from holding a meeting in East 
Jerusalem. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht quotes NRP leader 
Zvulun Hammer as saying: Giving the PA a foothold in Jerusalem 
is tantamount to letting it trample on the State of Israel's 
honor. Moledet leader Rehav'am Ze'evi said the Palestinians are 
making a mockery of the State of Israel, and that is why Rabin 
must prevent the meeting in Jerusalem.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, PLO Executive </F>
Committee member and official in charge of financial affairs for 
the Palestinian National Authority, by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jericho 
on 19 May; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, 
official in charge of financial affairs for the Palestinian 
Authority: Today you arrived in Jericho. What would you like 
to say after a very long absence? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] I would like to say that this is one of the 
happiest days in my life. I extend greetings to our great 
people, who waited for our return and with whom we have waited 
to meet. This day will prompt me to do all that I can to fulfill 
my duty in a manner that satisfies my people, my consciousness, 
and my God. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the priorities in the economic field? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] Priorities in the economic field include 
rebuilding the infrastructure. There is of course an emergency 
reconstruction program, prepared through an agreement among the 
World Bank, the donors commission, and the PLO, particularly the 
Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction. 
This program is called the emergency program. According to that 
program, there are issues related to roads, transportation, 
water, solid waste treatment, agriculture, industry, tourism, 
education, and health. In my view, the private sector has to 
take responsibility in housing, tourism, agriculture, industry, 
and energy. 
  [Mu'addi] Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, you have not taken 
part in the economic talks [between Israel and the PLO]. Do you 
accept and approve of this [economic] agreement? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] No. 
  [Mu'addi] What are your reservations? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] That agreement was not based on my 
legitimate right to build a Palestinian national economy based 
on my national right to self-determination. Regrettably, that 
agreement considered Israel's interests at the expense of the 
Palestinian Arab people, who want to establish an independent 
economy based on the economic charter of peoples and states that 
gave all peoples the right to establish their national economy 
away from any foreign intervention. Accordingly, I think we have 
a legitimate right to establish this economy without having 
obstacles and restrictions imposed on us and this point should 
have been considered by the Israeli negotiators. 
  [Mu'addi] One final question. There are reports that Yasir 
'Arafat is making his arrival here conditional on the financial 
assistance from the donor states? 
  [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat has not made any such 
statements. The only condition he has set for his arrival is 
that he must be convinced that his mission will be successful. 
When conditions are appropriate, he will come here. Difficult 
financial conditions are one of the problems we are all facing. 
  [Mu'addi] Mr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, official in 
charge of financial affairs in the Palestinian Authority, thank 
you very much. 
  [Al-Nashashibi] Thank you.

the autonomy elections. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0800 GMT on 20 June 
adds: "A senior security source told our correspondent Moti Amir 
that nobody is preventing Samir Ghawshah from entering the 
autonomy area. The source denied the Palestinian sources' claims 
that Israel is preventing Dr. Ghawshah from entering the 
autonomy." 
  ["Dr. Ghawshah told our correspondent that the PLO has 
submitted a list of names of approximately 500 PLO members who 
are slated to arrive in the autonomy, including approximately 
one-third of the Fatah Central Committee members in Tunis. So 
far, Israel has not agreed to their request to enter the 
autonomy."]

  [Text] Cairo, 30 Jun (MENA) -- Zuhdi al-Qidrah, Palestinian 
ambassador to Cairo and representative of the Fatah Movement, 
has said that Palestinian-Israeli talks will resume next week. 
The talks, he said, will address various topics not discussed 
in previous talks as well as the early transfer of authority to 
Palestinians in the West Bank and the deployment of Palestinian 
police and security forces in various West Bank towns and 
villages. 
  Speaking to MENA following his return from a brief visit to 
Gaza, al-Qidrah said that the Palestinians will move into Rafah 
checkpoint offices in the next few days and that visa procedures 
for visitors to Rafah have been coordinated with various 
Palestinian Authority departments. The first such visas will be 
issued in the first week of July, he stated. 
  Al-Qidrah said that he presented a detailed report to 
Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat about the visit he and Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th paid to Gaza. Al-Qidrah added that he briefed 
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmi on the situation 
in Gaza and on a number of points in the Cairo agreement with 
which Israel has failed to comply. 
  The Palestinian ambassador said that, during his visit to 
Gaza, he called on Israeli officials to fulfill the 
Palestinian-Israeli agreement in its entirety and release all 
detainees immediately.

Accusations of Torturing Detainees in Strip's Prisons"] 
  [Excerpt] London, Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- A senior 
Palestinian police official in the Gaza Strip has denied that 
detainees are tortured. The official said that these are 
unreliable allegations which have nothing to do with reality. 
The official was answering a question about statements made by 
Mu'tazz Hakim, whom the police arrested on 6 June at his 
residence in al-Nasr district -- Block 60, Gaza City. 
  The official said that this person was not subjected to 
torture or any other violations. Proof of this is that the 
human rights association visited him during his detention. 
  But Kahil, who joined the police service recently to work in 
the criminal investigation section in al-Rimal station, spoke 
about the circumstances of his arrest and the torture he was 
subjected to during four days of detention. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Hanan 'Ashrawi by Thomas Datt; place and </F>
date not given: "The Arabs Are Not Incapable of Democracy"] 
  [Excerpt] [Datt] How does your commission [Palestinian 
Independent Commission for Civil Rights] work? 
  ['Ashrawi] It combines the work of the ombudsman with that 
of state control. We want to ensure that there is a legal 
system and that it is applied in a uniform way. Basic rights 
and freedoms have to be protected. We supervise, of course, the 
work of the authorities, in order to prevent the abuse of power 
and the embezzlement of public funds. 
  [Datt] On what legal basis? 
  ['Ashrawi] First of all, the decree that was signed by 
'Arafat and obliges the authorities to respect the work of the 
commission is our basis. We have drafted our own statutes and 
the legal basis that is to be included in the Palestinian basic 
law. Afterward, we will not be subject to the executive and, in 
contrast to nongovernmental organizations, we have the 
opportunity to intervene. 
  [Datt] How do you want to cooperate with the opposition? 
  ['Ashrawi] Our commission serves everyone in the same way. 
And I think that we will be respected by all people. 
  [Datt] But Hamas does not respect anyone at present. 
  ['Ashrawi] We should be able to solve this problem, because 
we will protect the right to be clearly different. This 
guarantees the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech, the 
freedom to belong to different political parties -- provided 
that this is done within the framework of the laws in force. 
  [Datt] You say that the relations between Israelis and 
Palestinians are "fatally close" and propose a separation, so 
that they can meet again later as equals. 
  ['Ashrawi] Both sides suffered from the situation of 
dominance and oppression for many years. Of course, the victims 
are saying that it is far, far more painful to be a victim. 
However, the distortion of the system and the psyche of the 
oppressor is certainly not desirable. I neither want to be the 
victim nor the oppressor. Accordingly, we have to put an end to 
these abnormal relations, in order to be able to meet again as 
equals, because this is the only way in which the main reasons 
for the conflict can be eliminated. The Israelis still want 
hegemony over the Palestinians, but it only brings all the 
destructive elements of occupation to this new stage, too. 
  [Datt] I see the Palestinians in a dilemma here: They have 
to put an end to their dependence on Israel, but they also have 
orientate themselves by its model if they want to push through 
democracy. In the Arab world, democracy models are not very 
common. 
  ['Ashrawi] I do not know why we, as Palestinians, should not 
develop a democratic system of our own and nevertheless be part 
of the Arab world. The Arabs are not incapable of democracy. 
In many countries, an evolutionary process is taking place. 
And I think that we can be the vanguard there. This is what 
Palestinians have always been. The people here never feared 
challenges and they have tried new things. 
  [Datt] Is there something that you would take over from 
Israel? 
  ['Ashrawi] As a result of the forced relations, many 
Palestinians know Israel better than the Arab world. We know 
the oppressor from his best and his worst side. In our part of 
the world, Israel is the country from whose experience in the 
development of the state we can learn. Moreover, freedom would 
have to be mentioned, although it has only been implemented in a 
selective way, for example, the freedom of speech. However, we 
need the Arab world not only for economic or historical reasons, 
but also for political ones. There should be natural solidarity. 
  [Datt] And what do you expect from abroad? 
  ['Ashrawi] We have so many needs. First of all, there is 
the comprehensive economic development program. We start from 
such an unfavorable position that the transition period will 
fail if we do not get massive allowances and relief programs. 
  [Datt] Are you satisfied with Bonn's support? 
  ['Ashrawi] Frankly speaking: So far, I have not been 
satisfied with any kind of support, while, according to my 
experience, the people recognize the Palestinian people far more 
quickly than the governments and help them. Governments are 
always the last to react. [passage omitted]

  [Excerpt] Gaza, 17 Jun (MENA) -- Amidst the joy, ululation, 
and chants of the Palestinian people, who still cannot believe 
that they have started their first steps toward liberation from 
the 27-year colonization, yesterday evening Israel released 368 
Palestinian prisoners from a total of more than 1,000 who are 
supposed to be set free under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. 
  Hasan 'Asfur, a member of the Palestinian delegation to the 
peace talks who returned to Gaza over a month ago to join the 
members of the Palestinian National Authority in the Gaza Strip, 
said in a statement to MENA that most of the released prisoners 
are members of the Islamic Resistance Movement-Hamas and the 
Islamic Jihad. Foremost of these released prisoners are two of 
the leaders of the movement, Shaykh Sayyid Abu-Musamih and 'Imad 
al-Faluji. 
  This is the first time that Israel has released Hamas and 
Islamic Jihad members. 
  'Asfur adds that they were officially informed by the 
Israeli 
authorities of the release of this number of prisoners, 
including 160 convicts. 
  Contradictory figures were quoted yesterday and today 
regarding the correct number of the released prisoners. These 
figures varied between 200 and 400 prisoners. Some people even 
claimed that the released prisoners did not exceed 130 men. 
'Asfur said that all those released signed a "document of 
pledge." 
  This document contained -- after it was drafted three times, 
according to Palestinian sources here -- the following: 
  "I declare that I realize that this signature is a basic 
condition for releasing me. I also understand that this measure 
is being executed within the framework of the peace agreement 
signed between Israel and the PLO on 4 May 1994. Therefore, I 
promise to abandon all acts of terrorism and violence and to 
respect the law." 
  This is the first time that Hamas detainees have signed a 
document of pledge to release them after they received orders to 
do so from their leadership. However, more than 600 Palestinian 
detainees from various factions refused to sign the document and 
the Israeli authorities refused to release them. 
  Shaykh Abu-Musamih -- who had been convicted to nine years 
in 
prison, three of which he had already served, and who became one 
of the Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip after its leader, Shaykh 
Ahmad Yasin, was arrested -- affirmed that, despite the fact 
that his movement will not participate in any of the self-rule 
authority's activities, it does have a red line that it will not 
cross. This line is not to allow internecine fighting in the 
Palestinian arena. 
  Shaykh Abu-Musamih mentioned that his movement does not 
object to participating in any institution or sector that serves 
the Palestinian people. 
  Shaykh Abu-Musamih said that the movement will not be turned 
into a political party, but it is studying the possibility of 
establishing a political wing. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Gaza, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, 
professor at Gaza's Islamic University and a Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] sympathizer, has explained the rules that 
will govern the movement's actions in the coming stage, that is 
when the National Palestinian Authority assumes power in Gaza 
and Jericho. 
  Al-Zahhar, a leader of the former Palestinian deportees in 
Marj al-Zuhur in south Lebanon, said that the rules pertain 
first to Hamas' relationship with the Palestinian Authority and 
secondly with the Israeli occupation the status of which, as he 
put it, "has not changed." 
  In remarks to MENA's correspondent in Gaza, al-Zahhar said 
relations with the new Palestinian Authority are governed by 
several rules. First of all, there will be no infighting, but 
Hamas opposes curtailing the privileges of any Palestinian 
faction, especially those who made the intifadah bear fruit 
through their efforts, blood, and years in jail or exile. 
  Al-Zahhar continued: "We are not seeking power. I do not 
expect Hamas to vie for power because if it had really wanted 
power, it would have joined the plan from the beginning and 
acquired a respectable number of posts." 
  Asked whether Hamas will participate in the coming 
Palestinian elections, Dr. al-Zahhar said: "We will not 
participate in the Autonomy Authority at all. As we have always 
done, our participation will be through student councils, local 
councils, and professional associations. This will be our 
natural service to the Palestinian citizens." 
  Al-Zahhar concluded his remarks by declaring that Hamas will 
not lay down its arms until all Palestinian soil [kamil al-turab 
al-filastini] is liberated from the occupation and, as he put 
it, from the occupation's supporters.

  [Excerpt] The Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [PFLP] and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine [DFLP] have called for electing a new political 
leadership for the Palestinian people, rebuilding the Unified 
National Leadership of the Intifadah on new foundations, as well 
as holding an Islamic-Christian conference to defend the Arabism 
of Jerusalem. 
  This is part of a draft plan for national salvation which is 
being debated by the cadres of the two fronts as a prelude to 
endorsing it within the framework of their unionist plan. This 
constitutes a step along the road of unity between the 
Palestinian left and its democratic and revolutionary forces. 
The program asserts that the two fronts are willing to set up 
an alliance under this program with all forces in the 
Palestinian arena. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [By Maryam M. Shahin] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- The Israeli government has approved the 
entry of up to 600 Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) 
personnel including all members of the Palestine Central Council 
(PCC) in preparation for the expected entry of PLO Chairman 
Yasir 'Arafat to the Palestinian autonomous territories, PLO 
sources said Friday [17 June]. 
  The Israeli-approved list, which includes PLO activists from 
Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, is the first to include members of the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the 
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). Both 
groups reject the peace process. 
  Up to 400 names of PLO activists including members of 
women's 
organisations and medical organisations and administrative 
officials were approved Thursday and up to 100 more were passed 
through Gaza-based PLO officials to Tunis on Friday. 
  The PLO had submitted large lists to the Israelis and now 
they are flowing back to Tunis. Most members of the PCC were 
also given clearance by the Israeli authorities by Friday. 
  There was, however, a "B list" and "C list," according to 
PLO 
sources in Amman. These were still subject to further security 
checks by Israelis and in the case of "list C" -- which 
contained the names of those who were refused entry. "The PLO 
sources in Amman did not have the names of the people refused 
entry. [quotation marks as published] 
  The names included in the list of 600 are both from Gaza and 
the West Bank and include several hundred Fatah-affiliated 
activists, independents, about 25 FIDA members, 19 members of 
the PFLP and a handful of DFLP members. 
  Former militant activists and political prisoners expelled 
by 
Israel are among those whose names were approved. 
  The timing of the approval is in synchronisation with the 
expected entry of Mr. 'Arafat and an effort to make the 
Palestinian National Authority operational within the next few 
weeks. 
  The timing of Mr. 'Arafat's entry, initially tipped to have 
been on June 5, is still uncertain. Many PLO officials now say 
that it will not be until after the July 6 ceremony in Paris in 
which the PLO Chairman and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
will receive a special U.N. prize for their role in the Middle 
East peace process. 
  International funding is among the points of contention said 
to have delayed the PLO chairman's entry into Jericho and Gaza. 
World Bank officials were in Tunis to discuss the channelling 
of funds. 
  Mr. 'Arafat is said to be angered by the World Bank's 
insistence that the funding be given directly to government 
agencies or projects.

<F P=106> [Report by Yoram Kohen] </F>
  [Excerpts] Mass demonstrations against the peace agreement 
were held today in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The 
demonstrators also called for the release of all Palestinian 
prisoners. Violent clashes between Hebron residents and 
soldiers took place today against the background of the growing 
tension surrounding the prisoner release. Our correspondent 
Yoram Kohen reports: 
  What may have looked like just another demonstration for the 
release of all the Palestinian prisoners was actually more than 
that. Today's demonstrations in Jericho were really a protest 
against the peace process. This afternoon, over 2,000 
supporters of the rejectionist organizations, mostly from George 
Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], 
gathered to protest the Gaza-Jericho First agreement while 
demanding the immediate release of all Palestinian prisoners. 
The demonstration marched uninterrupted down the town's main 
streets. Palestinian policemen were prepared for the event but 
did not intervene. 
  Earlier, after Friday prayers, hundreds of Hamas [Islamic 
Resistance Movement] supporters demonstrated in the town for the 
same reasons. The Hamas activists, however, had a different 
slogan. They shouted that Islam is the solution. [passage 
omitted] 
  Residents of the Gaza Strip also demonstrated today over the 
prisoner issue. The demonstrations have been held every day for 
a week now. The rally was organized by the PFLP. The residents 
are furious with the Palestinian leadership and claim it 
capitulated to Israel on this issue. 
  Nabil Sha'th said today that the negotiations on the release 
of those prisoners who still remain in jail will start at the 
beginning of next week. Up till now, approximately 1,300 
prisoners have refused to sign a commitment to stop terrorist 
activity. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Speech given by Malian President Alpha Omar Konare at </F>
banquet given by Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi in Tripoli 
on 16 June--recorded] 
  [Excerpt] Dear brothers and friends. The presence of 
Blaise Compaore, Mahamane Ousmane, and I around our brother host 
Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi this evening is not a mere coincidence. 
It is in the name of common history and our preoccupations now 
and in the future, a future we want to build together. We all 
reject the current misfortune of our continent. We all refuse 
to believe that our continent is a continent of hatred and 
violence. What is happening in Rwanda and elsewhere does not 
reflect the reality of our continent. This misery and hatred 
are not a fatality, and we have the means to end them. Our 
presence here also expresses this loud and clear. 
  Dear friend al-Qadhdhafi, we have come here to express our 
solidarity to you and to your people. [applause] The journey 
here will never be too long or too uncomfortable. What we are 
doing this evening has already been done by the 53 African 
states in Tunis. This was already done by the Nonaligned 
Movement, by the Arab League, and by the Islamic Conference last 
year and this year. We hope that our voice will be heard. We 
will do everything so the message gets through in every scene 
tomorrow. We have the obligation to do so. The future of the 
Libyan people concerns us. It is important that conditions be 
created today to continue the march. 
  It is important that justice should be done today. We stand 
by your side in this struggle, dear brother. You are aware of 
our problems and the difficulties we are going through at the 
moment. We will have to do everything in our power to prevent 
our countries from sliding toward ethnic, racial, regional, and 
religious conflicts. We cannot fight the battle for democracy 
and nationalism on ethnic, racial, regional, and religious 
basis. Our continent needs social justice and solidarity today. 
It is with solidarity, hard work, and commitment that we will 
be able to face this challenge. We need solidarity, and we 
should move rapidly towards strong integration of our countries. 
Regional integration should not be an empty word or a mere 
slogan, otherwise, we condemn our continent to bankruptcy by the 
end of the century. Regional integration is a must. We believe 
in it, and we will work for it. If we fail to do so, we and our 
children will be doomed. [passage omitted] [end recording]

<F P=106> [Address by Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi at a </F>
banquet held in honor of the visiting presidents of Mali, 
Burkina Faso, and Niger in Tripoli on 16 June -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] In the name of God. I warmly welcome our 
brothers and neighbors, the leaders of the African-Muslim 
countries: Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso in the same manner as 
we welcomed our friend Museveni, the Ugandan president, and 
before him our brother Deby, the president of Chad. 
  The Libyan people welcome and appreciate such solidarity 
from 
their brothers because it will consolidate the Libyan people's 
position in its confrontation with the conspiracy led by three 
colonialist-Western countries. [passage omitted] 
  The Libyan people feels comfortable after the effort it 
extended to the neighboring fraternal peoples and deems that the 
patriots have assumed power in these countries and the agents 
have fallen. 
  The Libyan people has undertaken numerous responsibilities 
toward these peoples. The victory of the will of the peoples of 
Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Chad, and the consolidation of 
freedom and democracy....[pauses] On the other hand, from the 
viewpoint of the Western imperialist countries, what the Libyan 
people were doing was considered support for international 
terrorism, and considered the training camps for those leaders 
and peoples, who were carrying out a liberation war, as 
terrorist camps. This pretext has now been exposed, and this 
Western propaganda, which they used so frequently in the 
aggression against Libya, has fallen. But, it seems that the 
colonialists will not let the Third World achieve stability and 
build itself in order to progress. 
  After these national movements won in these countries, we 
see 
that the colonialist countries work toward creating trouble and 
problems for them. The material evidence that condemn the 
countries of Western colonialism are obvious. They accuse us of 
all untrue accusations and refuse to be confronted with the 
facts that condemn them. Regrettably, this will not lead to an 
understanding between us. 
  We all know that these peoples now, in Niger, Burkina Faso, 
and Mali, who aspire for stability and construction, are today 
the target of a new plot. The role of the old type of 
colonialism has been concretely confirmed. This implicit and 
flagrant interference in the domestic affairs of these peoples 
contradicts the statements and declarations made by these 
countries. 
  In the past they accused Libya of being behind the 
destabilization of African states. Yet, it transpired that 
Libya was behind the cause of liberation and people's democracy. 
Now, the very states who used to accuse Libya are the ones who 
are trying fervently to destabilize the African continent. 
  These are inhuman ethics and a flagrant injustice. The 
Western states are constantly pursuing these states; they are 
trying to sow instability in them; they deny them a chance to 
prove themselves. Psychologically speaking, we feel as if we are 
facing groups who are enemies of humanity. We are facing a 
mentality used to arrogance and the enslavement of others. This 
is not an accusation, but a reality. 
  Who on earth can belittle a person who happens to have a 
black skin? Who in the world introduced the words racial 
discrimination to the dictionary? They are the Western 
colonialist states. 
  Regrettably, we are facing peoples who are defying the whole 
of mankind. We are in confrontation against arrogant states, 
who impose their wrath against us; they use a veto against our 
future. When we raise our voice and resist, they accuse us of 
being warmongers, and against peace. 
  What kind of peace are they talking about? They are talking 
about surrender and that Third World people should surrender 
without making a stand. We have decided, nonetheless, to 
resist. A fact that they must understand. 
  Africa should not be destined to face poverty and misery 
until doomsday merely because of its skin, which was God's 
creation. They have begun a new flagrant interference. 
Regrettably they have meddled with the United Nations, which 
used to be the refuge of peoples seeking peace and protection. 
They have torn up the UN Charter. They had no right to tear up 
a charter that was written by the people. 
  They have trodden on international law; they have no right 
to 
do so. It is an international law and not an internal one. 
They have been using the United Nations for a purpose 
completely different from the one that was intended for it. 
They are using the United Nations as a vehicle for 
neo-colonialism. 
  Before, they used the League of Nations to impose their 
protectorate on the colonized Third World countries. As soon as 
they fiddled with it the League of Nations fell. 
  Today, the Western powers are accused of working seriously 
for the fall of the United Nations. The best proof is the fact 
that they have been using the United Nations for their 
manipulation; they have transformed it into an instrument in 
their hands. They have trodden on its charter. 
  Today, they are carrying out their own work in the name of 
the United Nations. They are using the United Nations outside 
its Charter. Thus, they have decided to kill the United 
Nations. This attitude is a serious one that can be very 
harmful to people of the world. This means that we will face a 
new form of chaos. The world will be transformed into a jungle; 
and the Western states will be responsible for the outcome. 
  What is happening these days in a number of Third World 
countries is clear proof of what I have just said. They believe 
that the Third World is made up of children and duped people; 
this is in addition to their inferior attitude toward Africa; 
they think that the African people are mere gorillas living in a 
jungle; they do not believe that the inhabitants of Africa are 
human beings. Even Dr. Barnard, the heart surgeon who succeeded 
in performing the first heart transplant operation used to hold 
this way of thinking; i.e., black people are not human beings, 
consequently, one should carry out tests on them unreservedly. 
Consequently, he carried out numerous tests on black people, 
like the test performed in the West on mice and rabbits. 
  After having killed a large number of people and destroyed 
their hearts, he succeeded in perfecting the right heart 
transplant technique. All this stems from their attitude of 
inferiority toward the black race. They think that we do not 
understand this. 
  Their behavior is aimed at undermining our will, our desire 
to live, and our right to our land. Now, they are interfering 
in the internal affairs of every state; they believe that we are 
children and duped to the extent that they create problems, then 
they claim that they have to send military forces to solve these 
problems. 
  We are aware that they are the ones who created these 
problems so that they have a pretext to intervene and solve 
them; they think that we are naive and ignorant and imbeciles to 
be fooled by this game. Their mentality is still that of Vasco 
de Gama; they think that Africa still resembles the one 
discovered by Vasco de Gama when he gave Africans shells and 
beads and took raw material and land in return. All Western 
states are like Vasco de Gama; they share the same mentality as 
that of Vasco de Gama; they still perceive and consider us as 
the same people who were discovered by Vasco de Gama. These are 
the matters that incite revolution, and force us to accept the 
challenge. Why do they not leave Mali alone, and stop their 
interference? They should let this poor country rebuild itself 
and live. Why do they not leave Niger and Chad alone? All the 
suffering of these countries is due to this policy. 
  They must understand that while we meet at this level we are 
fully aware of their conspiracies. It is our right to fight and 
we have decided to fight so that they respect us and recognize 
that we are people like them, at least like them, even if we 
believe that we are better than them because we do not commit 
the acts they are committing. Therefore, our mentality is more 
noble than theirs. We do not have the mentality of absurdity, 
human disdain, race, and color segregation. They take pleasure 
in the suffering of the African peoples and laugh at the 
backwardness of the African that they imposed on them in the 
first place. 
  They consider Africa as a jungle, a place for hunting, a 
source for raw materials, and a garden where you can pick 
fruits, but they consider its inhabitants as gorillas. Thus is 
the Western culture that led to colonialism, and world wars, and 
it is the one we are facing nowadays under various names. 
  In Libya, they confronted us in the Gulf of Sirte. When the 
world condemned them and this problem was over, they invented a 
problem called al-Rabitah. When it became clear that al-Rabitah 
was a pharmaceutical plant, and the world condemned them and 
showed solidarity with Libya, they created the so-called 
Lockerbie issue. 
  In this context, the Libyan people hails your stance during 
the OAU [Organization of African Unity] summit meeting. The 
Libyan people hails its brothers and neighbors, as well as all 
the African leaders who stood with the Libyan people. 
  The world condemned them in the Gulf of Sirte and al-Rabitah 
cases, and is now condemning them in the Lockerbie case. 
Despite all this, we hear astonishing things. They say that 
Libya is defying the international community. Who is defying 
the international community? 
  For them, the international community means the Western 
colonialist countries. As for the others, they are not at the 
level of the international community. 
  The conspiratorial memorandum handed by the United States, 
France, and Britain to the United Nations was considered as the 
will of the international community. They ignore the will of 
Africa. 
  What do they have to say about the OAU summit meeting held 
yesterday in Tunis that expressed support to Libya and the 
proposals it made. Are the African countries considered out of 
the international community? 
  The Nonaligned Movement expressed support for Libya, the ICO 
[Islamic Conference Organization] expressed support for Libya. 
The Arab League expressed support for Libya. The OAU adopted 
the Arab League resolution, in addition to the peoples, groups, 
parties, and organizations throughout the whole world. Despite 
all this, should we listen to them tomorrow, we will hear the 
same broken record: Libya is defying the will of the 
international community. In fact, they are the ones who are 
isolated. They are the ones who are isolated by the will of the 
international community. This will is now on the Libyan side. 
The international community is now expressing full support and 
sympathy for Libya, and condemns the three Western countries. 
  Despite all this, we can still hear insolent statements full 
of disdain to the international community. This is the stubborn 
mentality that we are facing. 
  We recently heard that a Palestinian person admitted 
responsibility for causing the explosion of the Pan Am aircraft. 
He made this confession before a court. The day after, the 
West denied this confession. The world was shocked. How could 
this happen? Yesterday, we were looking for whoever was behind 
the Pan Am explosion. 
  We say to the world: Do not be surprised, for the reason is 
very simple. This Palestinian is poor. He does not have 
millions to compensate the families of the victims. Therefore, 
how could one charge him for this act? Libya, however, is rich. 
It can pay damages. So, one must accuse it. 
  This is the reason the world has been laughing at this: How 
can one admit [responsibility for this act] only to hear the 
West tell him: No, no, it is not you. 
  As long as the issue is one of compensation, and so that 
Libya rids the world of this problem and prevents respectable 
presidents coming all the way from their countries to Libya on 
foot [as heard], because of this unjust resolution....[pauses] 
  The world is tired of all the fuss made about Libya. The 
embargo on Libya has ruined many countries and even the West has 
lost out because it is stupid. In order to rid the world of 
this problem, since the issue is about compensation, Libya does 
not object to the creation of a compensation fund, for this 
would be a humanitarian action. This fund would be used to 
compensate the victims' families, including those of Lockerbie, 
just for the sake of the world and in order to rid the world of 
this tension. There are families of Libyan victims who were 
killed by America and Britain. However, the Libyans are perhaps 
rich and may not need any compensation. There are also Iranian 
families whose relatives were killed by America when the U.S. 
Navy shot down the civilian aircraft aboard which they were 
flying. It could be that Iran is rich and would not want any 
compensation. 
  There are also the victims of the Italian airliner shot down 
by the U.S. fleet over Ustica. There are the Lockerbie victims 
and maybe the Americans and the British are poor and would like 
damages. We do not object to the creation of a compensation 
fund; and let us erase the confessions of that Palestinian and 
let us tell him: Keep quiet, we know that you carried out the 
Pan Am operation but you have not got any money. This is a good 
solution. 
  The Libyan people are once again, I believe, doubly happy. 
Once because their efforts with the neighboring and sister 
states would not have been wasted. Nationalist regimes were 
established in Egypt [as heard], Sudan, Chad, Niger, Mali, and 
Tunisia. Nationalist regimes and popular regimes dear to Libya 
were established in these countries. These efforts were 
considered as aimed at destabilizing Africa and were regarded as 
terrorism, but the result was the triumph of the nationalist 
regimes. 
  When we were working against the lackey regimes they told 
us: 
You were destabilizing Africa. Now we have united with 
nationalist regimes they tell us: This is unity, you have 
imperial ambitions. They have been stubbornly against us in both 
cases. [passage omitted] 
  I have one remark to make before I conclude my speech, it is 
about our sisterly Rwanda. I would like to draw your attention 
to the fact that this is not the first catastrophe that has 
shaken Rwanda. We still remember with sadness and bitterness 
the tragic massacres of 1959 and 1973. Today we are witnessing 
fresh massacres. I am afraid that such ugly massacres will be 
repeated. We should, therefore, accept the bad in order to avoid 
the worse. 
  We are aware that the Tutsi tribes immigrated to this region 
hundreds of years ago. They might have come from Arab 
countries. Problems began to emerge between the original people 
and those coming from outside. Like between Palestinians and 
Israelis and whites and blacks in South Africa. The situation 
in Rwanda is, however, a particular one and should not be taken 
as an example for other countries. 
  Regrettably, the solution I am about to propose is a bad 
one, 
but it is better than the worse. If we want to stop the 
massacres and prevent their recurrence forever, we must separate 
the two races, the Tutsi and the Hutu. 
  What is now called the National Front is in fact the 
frontier 
of the Tutsis, and the so-called government is for the Hutus. 
International forces should now separate the two sides. The 
separation should be final between them. In fact, this is the 
only solution to prevent these tragedies from recurring. 
  Dear brothers, I thank you for this visit and this meeting 
that provided us with an opportunity to talk about these 
important issues, which we discussed today and yesterday. 
  I once more welcome you in your country and among your 
kinsfolk. We are your natural ally, and you can rely on this 
ally which will never disappoint you. The struggle continues.

  [Text] A press statement was issued today in Tripoli, 
Bamako, Niamey, and Ouagadougou, following the visit of 
Presidents Blaise Campaore of Burkina Faso, Alpha Oumar Konare 
of Mali, and Mahamane Ousmane of Niger to the Great Jamahiriyah. 
Here follows the text of the statement: 
  In the framework of the fraternal relations linking the 
Great 
Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah [RSPLJ] with Burkina 
Faso, the Republic of Niger, and the Republic of Mali, and 
proceeding from the principles and objectives of the OAU, and in 
eagerness to strengthen the relations of brotherhood and good 
neighborliness between their countries, Presidents Blaise 
Campaore of Burkina Faso, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, and Alpha 
Oumar Konare of Mali paid a business and fraternal visit to the 
RSPLJ from 15 to 18 June. 
  Brother Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great 
al-Fatih revolution, had metings with the guest presidents, and 
intensive talks were held between them on relations between 
their countries in the political and economic spheress, and on 
regional, African, and international issues of common interest. 
The leaders expressed satisfaction at the tangible development 
of relations and cooperation between them, and they stressed the 
importance of relations between their countries in the 
political, economic, and security-related domains, and the 
founding of the appropriate organs toward this end. 
  The leaders expressed their great concern over the situation 
in Rwanda. They condemn the massacres being repeatedly 
perpetrated against civilians in Rwanda. In this respect, they 
stressed the importance of an immediate cease-fire between the 
parties to the conflict, and the need to find a radical solution 
that would bring security and stability to Rwanda. 
  With the aim of bolstering collective relations between 
their 
states, the leaders underscored the importance of activating the 
group of states bordering the Sahara, and of promoting 
cooperation between them in order to secure stability and 
security, and to resolve the problems in the region, which would 
become an element toward a linkage and not separation between 
the north and south of the Sahara, and in order to secure 
collective cooperation between them in harmony with the 
historic, social, and cultural ties between their peoples. 
  The leaders reviewed the efforts being made to carry out the 
national charter in the Republic of Mali, and the talks underway 
in order to put an end to the armed rebellion in northern Niger. 
They stressed the importance of finding a final solution to 
these questions out of their commitment to preserving security 
throughout the region. Therefore, the leaders agreed that a 
meeting be held by the foreign ministers of the concerned states 
in the Republic of Mali in order to prepare for the convening of 
a summit in the RSPLJ. Toward this end, the foreign ministers 
have been assigned the task of intensifying contacts and 
meetings and exchanging information. 
  The leaders also reiterated their solidarity and that of 
their peoples with the people of the RSPLJ in facing up to the 
measures imposed on the Arab Libyan people. They expressed 
their support for the Arab, African, and international efforts 
being made in order to find a just, honest, and rapid solution 
so as to put an end to these measures, which affect all the 
peoples of the region. 
  At the conclusion of the visit, the presidents expressed 
their thanks and gratitude to brother leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi, the leader of the great al-Fatih revolution, and 
the Arab Libyan people, for the warm welcome and hospitality 
offered to them. 
  Signed in Tripoli on 9 Muharram, corresponding to 18 June 
1994.

<F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Libya: The United States </F>
Will Not Succeed in Imposing Oil Sanctions"] 
  [Text] Cairo -- In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo, a 
Libyan official criticized the "U.S. Administration's threat to 
escalate the sanctions against his country to include oil 
exports." He ruled out "the possibility of a Security Council 
resolution to that effect because the interests of several 
Security Council member states are linked to Libyan oil." 
  He pointed out that "the U.S. insistence on esclation could 
shut the door in the face of the attempts to resolve the 
Lockerbie crisis." He stressed that closing the door to a 
solution "would never change Libya's position or make it forfeit 
its sovereignty and break its laws." He said that "the Libyan 
people can live without the oil." 
  'Izz-al-Din al-Hinshiri, Libyan secretary of the General 
People's Committee for Communications (communications minister), 
left Cairo yesterday for his country via Tunisia after a visit 
to Egypt lasting several days. 
  Early in the week, he survived a road accident on his way 
from Libya to Cairo in the al-Dab'ah area near al-'Alamayn.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA) -- Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN 
secretary general's envoy investigating the Yemeni crisis, has 
said that the southern and northern Yemeni delegations told him 
that they are committed to the cease-fire and are aware of the 
importance of creating a mechanism to supervise it. 
  Speaking following separate meetings with a delegation of 
the 
Republic of Yemen, led by 'Ali Mansur Rashid, and a delegation 
of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, which recently proclaimed 
independence, Ibrahimi said that the aim of his talks with the 
two delegations was to establish a cease-fire in Yemen and 
devise a mechanism to monitor it. 
  Ibrahimi said that he will submit a full report on his 
mission to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali, who will in 
his turn present a report to the UN Security Council proposing a 
course of action on the crisis. [passage indistinct] 
  The UN secretary general's envoy said that he will continue 
to seek a stable cease-fire in Yemen, reiterating that both 
sides are aware that continued shelling is against their 
interests. 
  Ibrahimi said that continued fighting is neither acceptable 
or sensible, expressing hope that the cease-fire will be upheld 
as soon as possible. 
  Meanwhile, 'Abdallah Muhsin al-'Ikwah, spokesman for the 
northern Yemeni delegation, described as good the delegation's 
talks with Ibrahimi, which focused on ways to stabilize the 
cease-fire. Al-'Ikwah told journalists that the delegation is 
in Cairo "to meet with the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist 
Party, our partners in the coalition." Asked about the creation 
of borders splitting the countries in half, al-'Ikwah said that 
this is an inappropriate development. 
  For his part, Muhsin Bin-Farid, head of the southern Yemeni 
delegation, said that the delegation seeks the implementation of 
Resolution 924 as a first step that could lead to the discussion 
of other matters. 
  Concerning the need for a peace-keeping force to support the 
resolution, Bin-Farid said that such a force is needed; 
otherwise, UN resolutions will not be respected by any side. 
  Bin-Farid said that the southern delegation conveyed to 
Ibrahimi a call on the UN Security Council to take deterrent 
action against any side violating its resolutions.

  [Excerpts] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary 
General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid and UN envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi 
today reviewed the outcome of recent consultations between 
Ibrahimi and Yemeni officials concerning the Yemeni crisis. 
[passage omitted] 
  Asked about the nature of the problem facing a possible 
direct meeting between southern and northern Yemeni delegations, 
Ibrahimi said: I cannot speak in behalf of Yemeni sides. The 
two parties have agreed to accept the cease-fire and a mechanism 
should be created to stabilize that cease-fire. 
  This mechanism, Ibrahimi stated, consists of observers 
monitoring the cease-fire on the battle lines. He pointed out 
that the northerners want to revive the military committee but 
the southerners reject the idea, pointing to the committee's 
failure to end the fighting in the past. 
  The UN envoy said that a compromise solution must be found 
and that a new formula for this mechanism should be found that 
is acceptable to both parties. 
  Answering a question on whether he will hold other meetings 
with the Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said that 
he will not hold further meetings for the time being, but will 
fly to New York to report on his mission to the UN Secretary 
General. The UN envoy said that he will, however, remain in 
touch with the concerned parties and with the Arab League in an 
effort to resolve what he described as a difficult problem. 
  Asked to comment on Sanaa's refusal to deal with Aden as a 
state, Ibrahimi said that there are real problems involved but 
the solution should begin with effecting a cease-fire. He said: 
If someone wants to establish a state or preserve unity, why 
does he wage military operations? 
  Commenting on reports about the internationalization of the 
crisis, Ibrahimi said that the United States is a superpower 
that has international concerns and it is worried about the 
situation in Yemen. Washington, he emphasized, supports UN 
efforts to end the fighting and initiate dialogue. Third 
parties have the right to worry, he remarked. 
  For his part, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: The Arab League 
Council is still in open session with regard to the Yemeni 
crisis. 'Abd-al-Majid welcomed every effort exerted to resolve 
the Yemeni crisis. He said that he backs Ibrahimi's call for an 
end to the fighting in Yemen, saying that the devastation and 
bloodshed are detrimental to everything that the Yemenis have 
achieved in the past.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA) -- Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today met with Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's 
envoy to Yemen, who is currently visiting Cairo. 
  Ibrahimi stated after the meeting that he is continuing the 
dialogue with the brothers in Egypt in view of Egypt's role in 
the area and its interest in what is happening in Yemen. He 
said that he briefed Musa on the outcome of his talks with the 
Yemeni parties in Cairo, adding that they discussed the future 
prospects in Yemen. 
  Ibrahimi said that his talks with the two Yemeni parties 
last 
night confirmed that a cease-fire is an urgent matter. He 
expressed his deep regret that no cease-fire was achieved in 
Yemen despite the fact that the two sides have accepted and 
recognized its importance. 
  The UN envoy said that the two Yemeni sides recognize the 
importance of the existence of a mechanism to supervise and 
consolidate a cease-fire in Yemen. He noted that no agreement 
has been reached yet on the formation of such a mechanism to 
undertake such a duty. He expressed the hope that all the 
parties will continue their contacts with the brothers in Yemen 
to urge them to quickly agree on the establishment of this 
mechanism to enable it to carry out its role. He reiterated 
that a cease-fire is the basis for achieving any progress in 
solving the Yemeni crisis. The UN envoy wondered how fighting 
among brothers can continue like this, stressing that no one 
approves of the war there. 
  Ibrahimi said that he will leave Cairo tomorrow to submit a 
report to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali. 
  Asked about the possibility of a meeting between the two 
Yemeni delegations in Cairo today, Ibrahimi said he does not 
think that such a meeting will be held. 
  He emphasized that Egypt and the United Nations fully agree 
that a cease-fire must take place and the fighting must stop in 
Yemen.

  [Text] Douglas Hogg, British minister of state at the 
Foreign Office, has reiterated that Britain only recognizes one 
Yemen, the united Yemen established on constitutional bases. He 
noted that Britain has its own definite bases and rules to 
recognize independent states, adding that what is taking place 
in Yemen is not in harmony with these bases. 
  In a statement to the London-based AL-HAYAH published 
yesterday, Hogg said that Britain welcomed the UN initiative and 
supported the UN secretary general in his move to dispatch 
Lakhdar Ibrahimi to Yemen to end the fighting and resolve the 
crisis. He said: We are waiting, with concern, for his final 
report on this mediation. 
  Asked whether the UN envoy would fail in his mission and 
about his view regarding the imposition of international 
sanctions or military intervention, Douglas Hogg said there will 
be no Western or Arab military interference. He said: Nobody 
wants to compete with another on sending troops to Yemen, 
because such initiatives would be unwelcomed by this country. 
He said: The issue of military intervention or economic 
sanctions is out of question. He stressed that such methods 
would not stop the Yemeni war that has been raging among the 
sons of one homeland. 
  The British minister of state noted that the Arabs and the 
United Nations can only find a tool or method to end the war 
through dialogue and mediation to restore peace to Yemen. 
  Asked by AL-HAYAH about the size and kind of danger 
resulting 
from the events in Yemen, Hogg said there is no particular 
danger posed to the Gulf states, Saudi Arabia, or Oman from the 
war in Yemen, but it is difficult in this case to be fully 
certain of this. He said: However, I reiterate that the Yemeni 
war will remain confined within the Yemeni territory.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council and supreme commander of 
the Armed Forces, yesterday afternoon presided over a meeting of 
the Higher Defense Council. Several brother ministers and 
officials attended. 
  After reviewing the decisions it made during its previous 
session, as well as the extent of their implementation, the 
Council discussed the topics listed on its agenda. The 
conferees also debated the discussions held between brother 
Presidential Council Chairman Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and 
Lakhdar Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general who was sent 
to Yemen on a fact-finding mission. The brother president 
briefed the conferees on the talks he had held with the speaker 
of the House of Representatives, staff members of the House 
Speakership Office, members of parliamentary blocs, the acting 
prime minister, cabinet ministers, the leaders of various 
political parties and organizations, the leaders of popular 
organizations, as well as social, intellectual, and political 
figures in the homeland. 
  The conferees laid special emphasis on the efforts under way 
to implement UN Security Council Resolution 924, which concerns 
the situation in our country, in light of the government's 
appreciation of the aforementioned resolution and its declared 
commitment to handle it in a positive spirit, and to implement 
it in an integrated manner -- commitment that reflected the 
eagerness of the Republic of Yemen to achieve security and 
stability throughout its territory --, heedful that the UN 
Charter guarantees all members of the world body inalienable 
legitimate rights. 
  The conferees also debated the recent gesture made by the 
political leadership to reactivate the work of the Joint 
Military Committee so it may establish a cease-fire. 
  The Council discussed several important reports pertaining 
to 
developments in our country in the military, political, 
economic, and social fields. It also debated the executive 
programs endorsed to address the impact of the rebellion and 
violation of constitutional legitimacy, which have caused untold 
hardships in the country. For the country is currently 
experiencing a military mutiny and a bloody national sedition 
that have been courageously, heroically, and firmly confronted 
by our people and their valiant Armed Forces. 
  The Council has made several decisions and issued various 
directives to promote the victories achieved to safeguard unity 
and constitutional legitimacy, and nurture the solidarity and 
cohesion existing between the people and official agencies, 
which must be manifested through supporting the Armed Forces and 
security troops in their efforts to carry out their sacred 
national duties. These decisions and directives also addressed 
the connection between political action and the national 
objectives of our Yemeni people, the objectives of shielding the 
unity of their homeland, protecting democracy, and safeguarding 
all the national and constitutional gains made by the Republic 
of Yemen.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Fathi al-Qatta' in Sanaa] </F>
  [Text] Early this week, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry 
stopped financial remittances through the Yemeni Central Bank to 
some of its diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Those 
include the embassies in Washington, New Delhi, Rome, Havana, 
Cairo, Muscat, Tehran, and Nairobi. The measure was adopted 
because the majority of the staff of those embassies supports 
the secessionist step declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid on 21 May. 
  Last week, Najib al-Haddi, a leader of the Yemeni Reform 
Grouping [YRG] and brother-in-law of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid 
al-Zindani, member of the Presidential Council, was killed in 
the battlefield. Muqbil al-Fil, a member of the Yemeni House of 
Representatives and a leader of the YRG, was also killed. 
  Official and semiofficial Yemeni newspapers, as well as some 
parties that support unity, have launched fierce media campaigns 
against Saudi Arabia after its involvement in the Yemeni crisis 
and support for the secessionists diplomatically and militarily. 
  During President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to the two 
newly created camps of Zafar and al-Fatah in Dhamar last week, 
it was noticed for the first time that there were tanks having a 
different color of soil and desert. It was learned that these 
tanks were sent by Saudi Arabia to the secessionist forces 
through the Sharurah region, under Saudi occupation, near 
Hadhramaut. The forces of legitimacy seized those tanks but did 
not announce this. 
  There have been some changes in the military leaders. Some 
commanders who are close to President Salih were dismissed. 
Those included Colonel Ahmad Faraj, commander of the Khalid 
Bin-al-Walid Camp, and Colonel 'Abdallah al-Qadi, commander of 
the Infantry Brigade. The two camps are in Ta'izz. The 
commanders were dismissed because of the losses sustained by the 
forces of the two camps on the fronts. 
  It is also rumored in Sanaa that there has been a recent 
dispute between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Brigadier 
General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the defense minister, because 
the latter refused to storm Aden justifying this by the great 
losses that the forces will incur, as well as the civilian 
losses. Hadi thinks what should be done is only to tighten the 
siege around Aden for some time and consequently bring about a 
change within the leadership and the military command of the 
Yemeni Socialist Party. 
  Sanaa restored direct contacts with the outside world 
yesterday.

  [Text] In a telephone contact with MBC a short time ago, 
'Abd-al-Salam al-'Ansi, the second-ranking man in Sanaa, set 
Sanaa's conditions for holding a dialogue with the southern 
Yemenis. He stressed that this dialogue will not be held 
outside the framework of the tripartite coalition that ruled 
Yemen before the war. 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Ansi] We have, in fact, expressed our 
willingness to go to Cairo, on condition that the meeting 
involves the ruling tripartite coalition in the Republic of 
Yemen and that it will not be a meeting between two governments 
or parties. If this condition for the meeting is met, then we 
will agree to it; but if it is to be held on the basis of talks 
between the so-called secessionist government and the legitimate 
one, then we reject it. 
  [Ahmad Manjunah] Mr. al-'Ansi, have you told UN envoy 
Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi with this position? 
  [Al-'Ansi] He will be informed of this appropriate reply if 
the consultations continue. [end recording]

news agencies that the Government of the Republic of Yemen has 
agreed on the participation of Arab and foreign countries in the 
committee that will be in charge of consolidating a cease-fire. 
Brother Muhammad Salim Basindwah said: It should be clear that

Government of the Republic of Yemen agrees on activating the 
joint military committee, which includes Yemeni military 
officials and representatives from Jordan and the Sultanate 
Oman. He added that the Yemeni Government agreed on adding 
representatives from Syria and the Kingdom of Morocco, for the 
Arab side, in addition to the U.S. and French military attaches 
from the non-Arab side.

<F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of </F>
planning and development, by Ahmad Birru in Sanaa; date not 
given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemen's 
planning minister: Lakhdar Ibrahimi has been on a tour of 
regional capitals and held talks with the constitutional 
authorities in Sanaa and the Socialist Party leaders, who 
declared secession, in al-Mukalla. Has this led to any change 
in Sanaa's conditions for the dialogue and what are the 
practical results of this tour so far? 
  [Al-Iryani] The conditions set by Sanaa to conduct a 
political dialogue to end the crisis have not changed. Sanaa 
insists that such a dialogue must be held under the canopy of 
constitutional legitimacy and the Republic of Yemen's 
Constitution, and based on recognizing the outcome of the 27 
April [1993] elections, the unity of the Armed Forces, and 
dismissing from the dialogue those against whom the public 
prosecutor has issued arrest warrants. 
  [Birru] The Arab League secretary general has announced that 
the Arab League's failure will lead to requesting the UN 
Security Council to take deterrent measures against the party 
that does not abide by the cease-fire. 
  [Al-Iryani] That statement, which was made by an Arab League 
assistant secretary general and not the secretary general, came 
as a shock to us in Sanaa. The Arab League is playing a role 
that it is not accustomed to and is using language that we have 
never heard before. But the statements were made by an 
assistant secretary general. His words may have failed to 
express what the Arab League means exactly. But the principle 
in itself was strange. The Arab League has never addressed any 
Arab issue through threats to seek help from the world community. 
  [Birru] What is the outcome of Sanaa's moves on the 
international level to explain the Yemeni Government's views and 
the tour by 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-Ghani in the capitals of the 
super powers. Has that tour resulted in bringing about any 
change in the positions of these states? 
  [Al-Iryani] Undoubtedly, the tour by Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 
'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, resulted first in 
the drafting of the UN Security Council resolution. The initial 
draft that was proposed by Prince Bandar [Bin-Sultan, Saudi 
ambassador in Washington] referred to Yemen as the Arab Republic 
of Yemen, and not the Republic of Yemen. It also included 
several sentences which implied hidden intentions. The activity 
of Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani in this regard was 
positive. He also met with officials in the United States, 
France, and China. The main objective of that tour was to 
stress Yemen's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 924 
and its categorical rejection of any new intervention in Yemeni 
domestic affairs. 
  [Birru] The telephone call between President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the United Arab 
Emirates President: Was that the result of efforts by Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, and what was discussed in that phone call? 
  [Al-Iryani] The efforts of Lakhdar Ibrahimi are clear and 
specified by the UN Security Council resolution. But contacts 
between the brother president and His Highness Shaykh Zayid 
have, in fact, never ceased. These contacts have continued over 
these past weeks after the military situation was ignited by the 
secessionists. This was not the first contact between the 
president and Shaykh Zayid. 
  [Birru] What was the subject of the phone call? 
  [Al-Iryani] The subject was the topic of the hour; that is, 
establishing the cease-fire, annulling the secession, ending the 
conflict with the secessionists through peaceful means, and 
expressing the desire that the United Arab Emirates play a role 
in this regard. 
  [Birru] The multi-faceted dialogue: What happened to it, 
and what are the topics under discussion now? 
  [Al-Iryani] In fact the dialogue is, practically, governed 
by a UN resolution now. Lakhdar Ibrahimi stresses that his 
report will mention the fact that Paragraph 4 of Resolution 924 
can be implemented. Let us say that the warring parties now 
accept the dialogue and we have stressed to Brother Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi that we feel this dialogue should be held within the 
framework of the three parties of the government coalition. The 
Socialist Party is the direct party in this crisis, the party 
that declare secession, and the party that led the rebellion. 
We are prepared to hold dialogue with the Socialist Party 
leadership according to the conditions I mentioned before. 
  [Birru] What about the joint committee, the presence of 
observers, and Sanaa's approval of the presence of non-Yemeni 
observers? 
  [Al-Iryani] The joint military committee was established 
during the military tensions and before the military situation 
exploded. It had representatives from Oman and Jordan, as well 
as the U.S. and French military attaches. What Sanaa proposed 
is to revive this committee to supervise the cease-fire and seek 
help from the military commanders from both sides. We 
understood from brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi that there is a desire 
to include other states in this committee. We proposed that 
Syria and Morocco should be included. This proposal was 
conveyed by Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi to the secessionists in 
Jeddah and we are still expecting an answer. 
  [Birru] What is the status of the talks with the unionists 
in the Socialist Party; with whom and where are these talks 
being conducted? 
  [Al-Iryani] Such efforts were exerted before UN Security 
Council Resolution 924 was issued. Now that the resolution has 
been issued, I do not think there are any attempts to open new 
channels for dialogue. It is not useful to open several 
channels. Since there is a channel recommended by the UN 
Security Council, this should be the only channel. 
  [Birru] Will you agree to let the Socialist Party resume the 
same role it played and hold the same share of power it held 
before secession? 
  [Al-Iryani] We have stressed to Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi and 
others, as well as to several states, that we adhere to the 
outcome of the 27 April elections. This means that the 
privileges, given to the Socialist Party in order to avoid the 
situation we are in now, cannot be given to it again. As for 
the size of its share in power in light of the outcome of these 
elections, we will stick to that. 
  [Birru] What are the most significant reforms that will be 
introduced after the end of the war, whether on the level of the 
Army and the government institutions or the administrative 
powers, such as centralism and other issues? 
  [Al-Iryani] The issue of the decentralized self rule, or the 
so-called local government, was a principal point during the 
dialogue. We thought that an agreement over this point would 
also help us avoid the situation we are in today. However, this 
issue will be more pressing than before the military battles. 
This means that the financial and administrative 
decentralization and the local government will become, in my 
opinion, more important and urgent than they were before these 
military battles. 
  [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, how do you see the 
future: the future of the war, the future of unity, the future 
of relations between Yemen and the Gulf states, and the future 
of Yemen in general? 
  [Al-Iryani] First, we beseech God that the war will have no 
future, and that those who seek war will fail. As regards the 
relations between Yemen and its neighbors, I can stress that the 
efforts exerted before this war broke out to improve the 
relations between Yemeni and its neighbors were unprecedented in 
more than 60 years. But regrettably, these efforts clashed with 
the military explosion. I can stress that these efforts that 
were exerted still survive and the hands will continue to be 
extended. If we exerted unprecedented efforts in the history of 
relations with the neighbors, then these efforts should continue 
after this situation is over. As for the future of Yemen, I 
think that you, as a journalist who can tour all parts of the 
country, will not find any exaggerations in my statement when I 
say that the future of the united Yemen is a historic 
inevitability and that those who are seeking to challenge 
history have to reconsider their position 
  [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, thank you. 
  [Al-Iryani] Thank you.

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Muhammad Mayy] </F>
  [Text] Sanaa -- Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, deputy prime 
minister and planning minister in the Republic of Yemen, has 
disclosed that his government agrees to negotiate with the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] leaders who had announced the 
establishment of a state in the southern and eastern 
governorates of the Republic of Yemen. 
  In a statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Iryani specifically said: 
We are ready to negotiate with any of the YSP leaders within 
the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 924, which 
invites those concerned from the Yemeni parties to search for 
peaceful solutions to the Yemeni problem. He said that the word 
"concerned" includes leaders from the YSP. 
  Al-Iryani said that the delegation which will leave for 
Cairo 
to seek a solution to the current crisis comprises an equal 
number of members from the three parties which participate in 
the coalition government: the General People's Congress, the 
Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the YSP. 
  Al-Iryani, who was preparing to leave for New York to pursue 
the search for a solution to the his country's crisis, said : I 
am going to New York to see what the Americans and the Saudis 
have in their quiver. 
  The Yemeni minister, who is close to President 'Ali 
'Abdallah 
Salih, did not elaborate on what other steps he believes the UN 
Security Council could adopt on the Yemeni crisis. However, he 
voiced extreme anger toward Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's recent statement warning that the UN 
Security Council will impose sanctions on the Republic of Yemen 
if the cease- fire is not respected. Al-Iryani said that by 
making such a statement, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has exceeded 
his authority as Arab League secretary general. The Yemeni 
minister said: I am surprised that the Arab League secretary 
general steps forward to condemn an Arab League member. He 
added: The only time we heard similar language was during the 
second Gulf War. Al-Iryani called on Arab League officials to 
act within the Arab League's framework. Addressing the Arab 
League secretary general, al-Iryani said: 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid 
does not have the right, nor is it his duty to act as an agent 
for issuing UN resolutions against the Republic of Yemen or any 
other Arab state. 
  The Yemeni planning minister said that his government wishes 
to reach a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni problem to avoid 
further losses resulting from the war against the YSP. He 
added: However, we will continue to resort to force if the YSP 
leaders adhere to their intransigent stands against the Republic 
of Yemen's constitutional legitimacy. He announced that the 
Yemeni forces will enter Aden and al-Mukalla by force if no 
peaceful settlement is attained. He added: I do not know of any 
country in the world which, faced with this situation, would not 
resort to force. He condemned those who try to impose a veto on 
the Yemeni forces entering Aden. He said: Those who impose a 
veto should submit a political alternative. He said: We act on 
the territory of the Republic of Yemen and we totally reject 
that they tell us not to do so. 
  The Yemeni planning minister seemed confident of military 
victory and restoring the rule of legitimacy to the entire 
Republic of Yemen territory.

  [Text] House of representatives delegations left Sanaa 
this morning for visits to fraternal Arab states. 
  A delegation led by brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab, member of 
the 
House Speakership Council, and includes brothers Ahmad Muhammad 
Sufan, Mansur Ahmad Sayf, and 'Abdallah al-Mukaybili travelled 
to the Arab Maghreb. 
  Another delegation, led by brother Yahya Mansur Abu-Isba', 
chairman of the Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee in 
the House, and including Deputies brothers Dr. 'Abdallah 'Ali 
al-Maqalih and Mahdi Abu-Bakr al-Hamid, headed for Egypt, Libya, 
Sudan, and Djibouti. A third delegation left for Syria and 
Lebanon. It is led by Deputy brother Sultan al-Barakani and 
includes brothers 'Abbas 'Ali al-Mu'ayyad and Ahmad al-Hayyan. 
A fourth team left for Iraq and Jordan. It is headed by 
brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kidsi and includes brothers 
Muhammad Naji 'Allaw and 'Abduh Muhammad al-Kanabi. 
  The delegations are going abroad to supplement Yemeni 
diplomacy and convey a true picture of developments in Yemen to 
fraternal Arab parliaments, with a view to securing sustained 
support for Yemeni unity as a pan-Arab gain, as well as a 
national Yemeni achievement. The aim is also to make it clear 
that there are separatist elements out to impose secession by 
force of arms. 
  In a predeparture statement to the Yemeni News Agency, 
SABA', 
brother Dr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Mahmud explained the mission assigned 
to the delegations sent out by the House to the Arab states. 
They are carrying messages from the brother speaker to his Arab 
counterparts spelling out our country's stance on current 
developments in Yemen and the dimensions of the anti-unity 
conspiracy. These contacts are necessitated by bonds of Arab 
brotherhood, since Yemeni unity is not an exclusively Yemeni 
concern, but a brick in the edifice of Arab unity. As such, 
Yemeni unity is as much an Arab concern as it is an affair 
relevant to Arab masses and states, he added. 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab said he hoped these delegations will 
accomplish their task.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, "vice </F>
chairman of the Presidential Council"; place and date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The refusal by the Sanaa regime 
to accept all the resolutions and appeals of the world has been 
accompanied by moves on the battlefronts to launch successive 
attacks on our brave forces who are defending Aden, its vital 
installations, and the civilians from among the sons of our 
people in a foolish and amazing insistence they [Sanaa regime] 
continue to attempt impossible advances aiming to occupy the 
steadfast city. 
  As I announce this to the world I would like to stress that 
the government of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has been 
asking for the necessity of convening an urgent meeting of the 
UN Security Council so that steps may be taken to put an end to 
the Sanaa regime's defiance of the resolutions of the Security 
Council and the appeals of the international community. 
  I also appeal to the fraternal Arab and Muslim countries and 
the friendly countries, as well as the five permanent members of 
the Security Council, to take decisive measures with regard to 
the Sanaa regime which is rejecting everything and insisting on 
the logic of force, particularly after this has been 
demonstrated to everyone. [passage omitted]

reviewed the moves of Yemeni political delegations at all 
levels, Arab and international, regarding the war against the

  [Excerpts] Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, deputy 
chairman of the Presidential Council, yesterday made inspection 
visits to several residential areas in the capital, Aden, which 
had been subjected to the random barbarous bombardment by the 
forces of the Sanaa regime. [passage omitted] 
  The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council also 
inspected one of the mosques damaged by the destructive and 
barbarous bombardment. Addressing citizens who had gathered in 
the area, he expressed astonishment at the fatwa issued by the 
Sanaa regime's ulema in contradiction with our pure Islamic 
faith in that it divides the Yemenis into the house of Islam and 
the house of polytheism [dar al-islam wa dar al-shirk]. [passage 
omitted] 
  Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri, the deputy chairman of 
the Presidential Council, went on in his address to the 
citizens, to deal with the foreign political stance. He said 
the political leadership had responded positively to the 
initiative of Mr. Lakhdar Ibrahimi, the UN envoy, regarding the 
cease-fire and a delegation from the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen had accordingly left for Cairo for discussions on this 
matter as a positive response to the initiative.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali al-'Amudi] </F>
  [Text] In the first southern reaction to Sanaa's denial of 
accepting the cease-fire proposed by the southern leadership 
through the UN envoy to Yemen, 'Abdallah 'Abd-al-Majid al-Asnaj, 
deputy prime minister and foreign minister in the government of 
President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has said that Sanaa's denial is not 
new. He said: We are used to Sanaa's going back on its 
approval of previous initiatives. He added: There is no going 
back on the decision to separate Democratic Yemen. Al-Asnaj 
described the presence of northern forces in the South as 
occupation. 
  Al-Asnaj revealed some aspects of the initiative proposed by 
the southern leadership to resolve the Yemeni crisis. In an 
exclusive statement to AL-ITTIHAD AL-USBU'I, al-Asnaj said: The 
southern initiative was an integrated plan that came in harmony 
with Security Council Resolution 924. The plan, he added, took 
into consideration the idea of setting up a military committee 
in which the two sides are represented, in addition to the 
parties that were represented in the previous military committee 
before the outbreak of the military operations such as the 
Sultanate of Oman and Jordan, as well as the U.S. and French 
military attaches. He said that the Russian Federation also 
asked to participate in this committee, adding that the southern 
plan called for expanding international participation to include 
the rest of the permanent members of the Security Council. 
  Al-Asnaj said the southern party also proposed expanding the 
work of the committee to guarantee its success in entrenching a 
cease-fire by adding some sisterly Arab countries and 
representatives of the Arab League and some Asian and African 
countries to monitor cease-fire violations and the party that 
causes these violations, to ensure the arrival of humanitarian 
aid, and to achieve disengagement between the forces in light of 
the military situation, which is completely different from the 
picture drawn by news agencies. 
  Al-Asnaj said he considered the presences of northern forces 
in the south an occupation, noting that the removal of these 
forces is only a matter of time. 
  The deputy prime minister and foreign minister of Aden 
government stressed that there will be no retreat from the 
declaration on the establishment of the Democratic Republic of 
Yemen following the southerner's suffering from, and contempt 
for, a unity that was based on hegemony, tyranny, and 
annexation. He said the assessment of unity in the future must 
be left for the future generations after people recover from 
this painful experience to realize a more stable and untroubled 
unity that agrees with Yemeni realities. 
  Al-Asnaj revealed why the meeting between President 'Ali 
Salim al-Bid and UN Envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi was delayed. He 
said: When we were in al-Mukalla, President al-Bid insisted we 
all must go to Aden so that the UN envoy can see for himself the 
extent of damage in the city and the deteriorating health and 
human conditions there. Ibrahimi, however, said he could not 
make the trip because UN regulations forbid its envoys from 
going into war zones and putting their lives in danger. 
  Al-Asnaj expected the UN secretary general to receive the 
report of his envoy soon and to present the report, after 
completing it, to the UN Security Council to take the necessary 
steps to implement Resolution 924. 
  Al-Asnaj explained that the southerners will call for an 
emergency UN Security Council session to discuss the northern 
violations that prevented the implementation of the UN 
resolution. The southern foreign minister underlined his 
accusations that foreign hands are prolonging the Yemeni war by 
providing military and political support to Northern Yemen, 
referring, particularly, to Iraq, Jordan, Sudan, and Iran. He 
said the prolongation of this war will have serious consequences 
on security and stability in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, 
especially in view of the important world interests in this 
region.

<F P=106> [Report by Lutfi Shatarah: "Al-Asnaj Tells AL-SHARQ </F>
AL-AWSAT: Urgent Contacts With Ghali To Urge New International 
Move"] 
  [Text] London -- South Yemen Foreign Minister 'Abdallah 
al-Asnaj has stressed that the southern leadership is going to 
seek urgent contacts with UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali 
over the latest military developments. 
  In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT al-Asnaj said that the 
south will urge the UN secretary general to make a move in the 
framework of the UN Security Council resolution, which 
authorizes him to brief the Security Council on developments in 
the situation in Yemen and to discuss the means capable of 
deterring the regime from violating international legitimacy and 
putting it in its place as an enemy of humanity and peace in the 
regime. The southern foreign minister accused President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih of working to thwart the efforts being made by 
the UN secretary general and his special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi to establish peace in Yemen. 
  He said that the continuation of the war declared by 
President Salih against the Yemeni people in the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen confirms his aggressive tendency and the 
untruthfulness of what he says, namely that he has accepted UN 
Security Council Resolution 924, which calls for an immediate 
cease-fire in Yemen. Al-Asnaj stressed that President's Salih 
forces, which are besieging Aden, have over the past two days 
shelled mosques, schools, and residential areas. And that they 
have fired more than seven rockets on the city, killing many 
children, women, and men in various parts of Lahij and Aden 
Governorates. 
  He also said that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is living under a big 
delusion, namely that he is still president of what used to be 
called the Republic of Yemen. He said that his attack on Aden 
and his haphazard bombardment of it have provoked feelings of 
anger in Arab, Islamic, and many other states. 
  The Yemeni minister, who is expected to arrive in Washington 
within the next 24 hours in the framework of southern diplomatic 
moves designed to rally political support for the new republic, 
added that the international community is tired of the northern 
leadership's attitudes after the confirmation of its 
noncompliance with the UN Security Council resolution, violation 
of the principles of the Islamic Shari'ah, and persistence in 
committing further war crimes. Al-Asnaj said that Sanaa's 
continuation of the war confirms its involvement in expansionist 
schemes of states outside Yemen designed to disrupt security and 
undermine stability in the region.

  [Text] Damascus, 18 Jun (MENA) -- Former South Yemeni 
President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad has denied that his supporters in 
the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] or the General People's 
Congress are involved in the current tragic events in Yemen. 
  In statements he made to the MENA correspondent in Damascus, 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad stressed that his supporters are the victims 
of this bloody conflict between the sons of the Yemeni people. 
He said that he is very pained by the reports by press agencies 
and international and humanitarian organizations on the tragic 
situation in Aden. 
  President 'Ali Nasir was commenting on a recent newspaper 
report that former leaders from South Yemen are involved in the 
fighting against the YSP so as to rehabiliate themselves and 
avenge the incidents of January 1986 that led to his ousting 
from his position. 
  The former south Yemeni president held some parties in the 
Yemeni leadership, which he did not name, responsible for the 
political and military conflict in Yemen. 
  He stressed that there must be a return to dialogue and a 
cease-fire, that the Yemeni leaders have to abide by the spirit 
of the Pledge and Accord Document, and that they have to deal 
flexibly and realistically with the UN envoy's endeavors. 
  He reiterated that he will not assume any responsibility in 
Yemen while there is fighting or secession, adding that the 
problem is a political one, not a military one.

  [Text] A responsible source has stated the following: In 
a desperate and treacherous criminal act, aircraft belonging to 
the traitorous rebels carried out an aggressive raid on the 
power generating station in the city of Mocha at 1415 today. 
This raid is part of a series of criminal actions carried out 
by this traitorous gang against economic and civilian 
installations and targets in our country that began with the 
firing of Scud missiles at defenseless civilians in Sanaa, 
Ta'izz, al-Hudaydah, Zinjibar, and (al-Rahidah), and includes 
the shelling of vital installations in Aden, led by the Aden 
refinery and the power generating station in al-Hiswah. These

the homeland and implement the scheme designed to fragment its

  The source added that these hideous criminal acts committed 
by the rebellious gang against economic targets and

when many vital installations and targets in Aden, where this 
criminal gang is entrenched, lie within the range of our valiant 
Armed Forces' artillery. Our Armed Forces, however, are 
extremely eager to preserve and protect these installations from 
this traitorous clique because they are the property of the

  [Text] We have just received this news report. A 
responsible source at the Ministry of Defense of the Democratic 
Republic of Yemen has categorically denied the report carried by 
the news media of the ruling military regime in Sanaa this 
evening that our military aircraft raided the city of 
al-Hudaydah and bombed the electricity-generating station at 
Mocha. The source confirmed that this report has absolutely no 
truth and is part of the cheap misleading information for which 
the stooges of the ruling military regime in Sanaa and their 
other news media have become famous for. This is known to 
everyone in the two parts of Yemen and, indeed, in the Arab 
homeland and the entire world. 
  The responsible source warned that this media report carried 
by the Sanaa media could be a new pretext to continue the 
shelling of the economic installations as well as the peaceful 
residential quarters in the Aden Governorate. The ruling 
military regime has grown accustomed to this recently after 
failing to achieve the strategic and military objectives of the 
war. This is a matter on which we cannot remain silent and it 
will be confronted with force.

  [Text] Aden, 18 Jun (KUNA) -- Seventeen people have been 
wounded in fierce fighting at the fronts surrounding Aden. The 
fighting continued until the early hours of 18 June. 
  The northern forces managed last night -- for the second 
consecutive day -- to advance a personnel carrier mounted with 
Katyusha rockets in order to shell the port of Aden; however, 
the rockets fell on some residential areas close to the port. 
Other rockets fell on the area surrounding Aden airport, 
injuring 17 people. 
  Last Thursday, a northern Katyusha vehicle managed to 
penetrate southern defense lines in the Bi'r Ahmad area, some 30 
km northwest of Aden, where it fired its rockets and hit a 
shipyard in the port area. Another vehicle managed at dawn 
yesterday to penetrate several kilometers inside the Sabr front, 
situated 30 km north of Aden, and fired its rockets, which hit a 
military camp near the area of Aden airport.

  [Text] A responsible source has said that Cairo radio 
quoted a so-called responsible source in Aden as saying that a 
military vehicle affiliated with the forces of unity and 
legitimacy carrying katyusha rockets apparently infiltrated the 
ranks of the rebellious and illegitimate forces and fired 
rockets on the Port of Aden. The radio said some shells fell on 
residential districts in the al-Tawwadi area in Aden. 
  At a time when we stress our categorical denial of the 
infiltration of any vehicle affiliated with our Armed Forces, 
and the impossibility of such an infiltration from the military 
point of view, we would like to say that this news report proves 
with categorical evidence that residential districts in Aden are 
being shelled from the military positions controlled by the 
forces of rebellion and secession inside Aden. This is with the 
aim of fastening the charge on the forces of unity and 
legitimacy and showing pictures of the victims of this criminal 
aggression, which is being carried out by the criminal 
secessionist gang against innocent civilians in valiant Aden. 
This is part of a failed attempt to draw world public sympathy. 
  The source stressed that the criminal, secessionist gang has 
not hesitated to commit the ugliest crimes against the homeland 
and the people. Through its repressive agencies and its 
militiamen, that gang is now exercising all types of pressure 
and torture against citizens in Aden. They take children, 
women, and elderly out of their homes by force, compel them to 
carry weapons, and push them into the combat lines and the 
crematorium of death.

  [Text] Sanaa, June 18 (INA) -- The Yemen has utterly denied 
the eruption of battles in the oil-rich Shabwah Province. 
  A Yemeni official source said that reports circulated by the 
secessionists on the killing of 50 military men during the past 
48 hours were groundless. 
  The source confirmed that Shabwah Province was now under 
control of the legitimate forces.

  [Text] In a telephone call with MBC, oil minister of the 
self-declared government in Aden, Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, 
announced that the southern forces today repulsed an attack by 
the northerners from the area of (Raml al-Sab'atayn) toward Wadi 
Hadhramaut in an attempt to capture the city of Saywun. He 
added that the southern forces repulsed the northerners at a 
location 130 km west of Saywun, taking 28 northern soldiers 
prisoner. We have the following report from [MBC correspondent] 
in Shabwah Tawfiq Jazulit: 
  [Begin recording] [Jazulit] The Governorate of Shabwah in 
south Yemen is characterized by its harsh desert topography. It 
consists of valleys, plains, and barren areas. It is about 100 
km wide and from the coast to the Saudi borders it is over 300 
km long. Shabwah is considered one of the most difficult and 
dangerous fronts, especially since travelling from one area to 
another is very difficult, if not virtually impossible in some 
places. Shabwah's strategic importance is that it is oil-rich. 
Because of its large size, the southern forces are very spread 
out. 
  [Unidentified soldier] This force is merely the rear guard; 
the rest of our forces have advanced close to the capital of the 
governorate. Our closest positions to the capital are 10-15 km 
away. 
  [Jazulit] The governor of Shabwah and commander of its 
front, Ahmad al-Fayiz Sarimah, says his forces control some 
parts of the vast area of Shabwah. 
  [Sarimah] In Shabwah, we now control 95 percent of the 
region. We welcome you now, if you have the time, to travel with 
us to (Qirdan), Wadi Armah, al-Sa'id, al-Musayni'ah, Nisab, 
'Azzan, and Mayfa'ah, except for the city of 'Ataq, which is no 
more than 5 square kilometers. 
  [Jazulit] With the respect to Shabwah's oil, the region's 
governor does not have any objections to allowing all Yemeni 
sides to use it so long as this is arranged through dialogue. 
  [Sarimah] If this is done through consent, negotiations, and 
Arab generosity, we do not mind sharing it with our brothers. 
This is a characteristic of the Arabs. 
  [Jazulit] The city of 'Ataq, which is about 50 km away from 
where we are now, is not considered by the military command to 
be a position of vital strategic importance like the oil wells 
that could play a decisive role in terminating the fighting 
between Aden and Sanaa. And the war goes on. [end recording]

  [Text] Early this morning some of the peaceful populated 
suburbs of Aden were subjected to barbarous and random attacks 
by artillery and rockets from the forces of the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa. The shelling was accompanied by desperate 
attacking attempts from the same forces to advance on all 
fronts. However, our brave armed forces intercepted these 
forces, and inflicted crushing blows on them. They also 
inflicted heavy human and material losses on them, and forced

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source in the Democratic </F>

  [Excerpts] At a time when the DRY [Democratic Republic of 
Yemen] announces its agreement to arrangements for an urgent 
meeting between the two sides, the southern and northern sides, 
in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in order that an agreement may 
be reached on a machinery to supervise the task of the 
cease-fire, and to establish it in accordance with the UN 
Security Council Resolution No. 924 observing any violation of 
it; and at a time when the DRY has informed Mr. Lakhdar 
Ibrahimi, the envoy of the UN secretary general, on the evening 
of 16 July about this, [passage omitted] the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa continued its flagrant challenge to the will of 
the Arab and international community. It embarked, since early 
this morning, on random and barbarous attacks with rockets and 
heavy, long-distance artillery against the peaceful residential 
areas in the suburbs of the city of Aden as well as against 
vital economic installations. This has resulted in the martyrdom 
of more than 20 persons, most of them children, women and the 
elderly, as well as a number of injuries. 
  This was accompanied by attempts to advance on all fronts 
towards the capital, Aden, a matter which compelled our 
defensive Armed Forces to repulse decisively this new aggression 
of the forces belonging to the ruling military regime in Sanaa. 
They stopped them from advancing. Battles were still 
continuing while this communique was being prepared. [passage 
omitted]

Ministry in the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] The city of Aden was subjected this evening to a 
surface to surface missile attack. The forces of the military 
regime ruling in Sanaa launched three surface to surface 
missiles toward the capital city of Aden. Our air defense 
systems confronted them and shot down two of them in mid-air 
while the third missile fell into the sea. 
  This failed savage missiles attack on the city of Aden falls 
within the framework of the flagrant defiance of the Arab and 
international will by the military savage regime in Sanaa. 
  The Defense Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen, 
while still exercising self-restraint, will not stand with hands 
tied amid the killing and destruction inflicted on our people by 
the adventurous gang of Al al-Ahmar.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F>
Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Yemen"; place and date 
not given] 
  [Text] The ruling military regime in Sanaa has continued to 
defy and ignore all the positive Arab and international efforts 
to bring about a cease-fire in Yemen. The latest of these were 
intensive efforts by Egypt and its president, Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak, to arrange a meeting between representatives of the two 
parts of Yemen in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, which should have 
been held today. 
  However, since early this morning the forces of the ruling 
military regime in Sanaa have resumed their random shelling and 
rocketing of peaceful residential areas in the city of Aden to 
kill civilians -- women, children and the elderly -- and destroy 
their homes. This follows the failure on the part of these 
forces to realize their strategic military ambitions of 
occupying our territory and forcing our people in democratic 
Yemen to submit to the adventurist authority of Sanaa by force 
of arms. 
  Also since this morning the forces of the ruling military 
regime have continued their attempts to advance towards Aden, 
but our defending Armed Forces repulsed them and prevented any 
advance by these enemy invading forces. Battles are continuing 
on all fronts following the refusal by the ruling military 
regime in Sanaa to listen to the voice of good sense and logic. 
Instead, it chooses to press on with its adventurist hostile 
operations against our people.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] What is being planned for the Yemen of unity and 
democracy, and what are the stands of its sons? We can 
ascertain that the conspiratorial plans against the Yemeni 
people and their unity are formidable. However, the united 
Yemeni people know very well that the objective is not only to 
fragment their unity but to ensure that the present and future 
generations remain preoccupied with fighting and disputes to 
keep Yemen engaged in futile conflicts. 
  One understands from the Arab and international moves on the 
current events in our country that there is more to the 
situation than meets the eye. There are those who support our 
unity and our people's aspirations. There are those who, 
surprisingly, adopt ambiguous stands. What is amazing, however, 
are the underhanded stands adopted by some sides. In spite of 
all this, our confidence in Almighty God will enable us to 
settle what is taking place in our country. Our asset and 
source of sustenance are our faith and our our people's abidance 
by unity and their eagerness to defend constitutional 
legitimacy. We also stress that our cause is purely a domestic 
affair, something which the brothers and friends should 
understand. Our acceptance of the proposals made by others is 
not an acceptance of interferences which conflict with the UN 
Charter and international laws, or harm our right to sovereignty 
and independence. 
  From this premise, we say that the gang of rebellion and 
treason, which has sold itself to the devil and sought to 
destroy the homeland and people's means, and undermine their 
unity will not succeed in attaining its designs and will not be 
able to salvage its base goals. Irrespective of the magnitude 
of the conspiracies and means available to the conspirators, our 
people will not yield. It goes without saying that thanks to 
our faith in our unity and respect for constitutional 
legitimacy, which embodies our will and our insistence to defend 
it, we will be capable of foiling all the attempts by those who 
conspire against our unity and who wager on the dirty 
secessionist clique which was discarded by the entire Yemeni 
people. 
  It should be understood that our respect for the endeavors 
that are made by international legitimacy comes from our belief 
that they stem from sympathy for our causes. This is because we 
are certain that the entire international community supports 
Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy. There is no excuse 
for any member of the international community to act otherwise 
because the entire world, under the new world order, should 
stand together to support peoples unity and democracy, and 
protect human rights and freedom. We believe that the entire 
international community supports Yemeni unity in line with the 
stands of the UN Security Council permanent members which 
support Yemeni unity, our democractic course, and our country's 
approach to a free market economy. 
  While emphasizing the importance for the members of the 
international community to support Yemeni unity and 
constitutional legitimacy, we must also remind of the need to 
respect the bases on which the new international order is being 
established. We should all work to entrench its concepts and 
enhance its traditions, far from motives stemming from interests 
or hegemony. 
  There is no doubt that the international community members, 
including the brothers, understand that what is taking place in 
the Republic of Yemen, the internationally recognized united 
political entity, is a domestic affair, and that the 
constitutional legitimacy government acts in a reasonable manner 
and in accordance with what its duties dictate and its sovereign 
rights, which authorize it to combat rebellion and the 
secessionist course of a treacherous and agent clique led by the 
so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who will be arrested and brought to 
trial soon, God willing, so that he and his clique will receive 
severe punishment for their crimes against the people and 
homeland. God supports our people's decision and will make them 
triumph in their struggle to protect their unity and safeguard 
their dignity, democracy, and rights.

  [Excerpts] His Excellency President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed 
Taya today received Mr. Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of 
civil service and administrative reform in the sisterly Republic 
of Yemen, who is also the special envoy of Yemeni President 'Ali 
'Abdallah Salih. [passage omitted] 
  After the meeting, the Yemeni minister made the following 
statement to our colleague Zaidan: 
  [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I am very happy with and 
honored 
by the reception by his excellency, the president. I was able 
to convey the message from Lieutenant-General 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, the president of the Republic of Yemen. 
  As you know, the bilateral Yemeni-Mauritanian relations -- 
which go back to historical times -- and the brotherly ties 
between the two presidents, the people, and the two governments, 
are given special importance by this continuity. Also, it 
should be mentioned that because of the current Yemeni situation 
to defend Yemeni unity, and what is going on in the Yemeni 
sphere, it was necessary to put the brother president in the 
picture and to brief him on the outcome of dialogue resulting 
from Arab and United Nations efforts. 
  We believe that the cause of Yemeni unity -- which is the 
cause of all Arabs -- has the support and enthusiasm of the 
president, as confirmed during our meeting. This support is to 
consolidate Yemeni unity and democracy in Yemen. This is not 
only to strengthen Yemen and secure victory in the cause of 
unity, but to consolidate it with this satisfactory start on the 
Arab front. [sentence as heard] 
  I cannot but express my thanks and gratitude in the name of 
Yemen, its government, people, and leadership on this occasion 
for the sentiments we received from the Mauritanian president, 
people, and government. Thank you very much. [end recording]

  [Text] Algiers, June 18 (AFP) -- The president of the 
Algerian Human Rights League (LADH), Youcef Fathallah, was shot 
and killed in his Algiers office Saturday, security officials 
said. 
  The officials gave no further details but witnesses said 
Fathallah, 64, was shot by a group of men who stormed into his 
office on Emir Abdelkader Square in central Algiers. 
  The president of the Algerian League for the Defence of 
Human 
Rights (LADDH), Abdennour Ali-Yahia, later appealed for an end 
to months of bloodletting in the north African state. 
  Ali-Yahia told AFP he had enjoyed "very good" relations with 
Fathallah, a lawyer and a member of the commission set up to 
investigate the June 1992 assassination of then-president 
Mohamed Boudiaf. 
  As a member of the commission, Fathallah had called for the 
closure of special internment camps set up in the Sahara desert 
for Islamic fundamentalists. He had headed the human rights 
league since 1991. 
  Fathallah was the fourth prominent Algerian killed this 
month 
following the assassinations by suspected fundamentalist 
militants of the rector of Bab Ezzouar University, Salah 
Djebaili, the chief of the government customs service Abdallah 
Moussouni, and journalist Ferhat Cherkit. 
  Nobody had claimed responsibility for the killing by 
mid-Saturday afternoon. 
  "The guns must fall silent, the blood must flow no more," 
Ali- Yahia said, adding that could only happen through dialogue 
between the authorities, the Islamic movement and political 
parties which received strong representation in the December 
1991 election. 
  Such parties would include former sole ruling party the 
National Liberation Front (FLN) and the Socialist Forces Front 
(FFS), he said.

  [Text] A delegation of European experts ended its official 
visit to Algeria today. It will be conveying to the European 
Council Algeria's strong wish to build partnership relations 
that would bolster the existing cooperation between Algeria and 
the European Union [EU] and open several opportunities for 
exchanges awaiting the establishment of a free-trade zone, as is 
the case with Morocco and Tunisia. Here are more details from 
our reporter: 
  [Correspondent] The delegation of European experts today 
ended its three-day tour in Algeria. The delegation held 
several working sessions with senior Algerian officials, the 
first of which took place yesterday at the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, where the delegation was received by Mohamed Salah 
Dembri, the minister of foreign affairs, and held a meeting with 
a delegation of Algerian experts led by the secretary general of 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Algerian delegation 
included representatives of vital sectors: industry, energy, 
trade, and agriculture. The meeting was aimed at reaching a 
partnership agreement between Algeria and the EU in various 
sectors prior to the establishment of a free-trade zone similar 
to those that the EU currently has with Algeria's neighbors, 
Tunisia and Morocco. 
  These talks, which are considered exploratory in nature, 
were 
followed yesterday evening by meetings that included the finance 
minister, the minister of small- and medium-sized enterprises, 
as well as the governor of the Algerian Central Bank. The head 
of the delegation of European experts stressed that the EU gives 
Algeria all opportunities on an equal basis with its neighbors 
and the states of eastern Europe. He also said that the 
partnership agreement that the two sides are working on would 
allow for exchanges in various economic spheres. 
  It is to be recalled that this round of talks will be 
followed by another round next autumn to finalize the 
partnership agreement that Algeria is seeking with the EU.

  [Text] The 30th OAU summit took place in Tunisia a few days 
ago. Algeria played a role in the treatment of two fundamental 
issues during the summit: Arab-African cooperation, and the 
Western Sahara issue. Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri 
made the following statement to television on these two issues. 
  [Begin Dembri recording] Arab-African cooperation is an 
issue 
requiring mutual analysis. The ministerial committee has not 
held a meeting about this for quite a few years. Algeria has 
played an important role in reviving this committee, and we 
asked for the next meeting to be held in Algeria as soon as 
possible. Africa has indeed contributed to several Arab issues, 
including the Palestinian issue. Today it seems to some 
Africans that the Arabs have no intention of encouraging 
Arab-African dialogue. That is why we are playing this leading 
role to strongly adopt the idea a new African-Arab meeting. 
  Regarding the Western Sahara issue, the UN plan details a 
number of conditions about the way the parties to the conflict, 
Morocco and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El 
Hamra and Rio de Oro [Polisario], should achieve rapprochement 
and reach an agreement regarding the pending issues, including 
determining the number of those entitled to vote, identifying 
them, organizing the election campaign, etc. There is also the 
issue of where the Moroccan administration and the Moroccan 
troops should be based during the referendum? Then there is the 
issue of the guarantees which should be provided after the 
referendum. The UN plan does not treat or solve all these 
points. In fact, the plan itself stipulates a direct dialogue 
between the two parties and final talks on these points. So far 
this has not taken place. 
  We have alerted the African countries -- and, thereby, world 
public opinion -- to the need to treat these points before the 
referendum. [end recording]

  [Text] There is great hope that the foundations of concord 
will be established during the coming months now that the 
institutions of the transitional phase have been put in place, 
especially in that dialogue is continuing with all 
sides--including those who continue to refuse to take part in 
the aforementioned institutions. 
  This was stated by Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salah

  [Excerpt] President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has ordered an 
increase in the number of Tunisian troops to the UN forces in 
Rwanda. This took place when the president received Defense 
Minister Abdelaziz Ben Dhia this morning in Carthage Palace. 
This decision gives substance to the determination of our 
country shown during the OAU [Organization of African Unity] 
summit in Tunis of assuming its responsibility in settling 
conflicts in Africa. President Ben Ali, the current chairman of 
the OAU, stressed that this initiative is a response to the need 
shown in the African summit for an effective contribution by 
African countries to the settlement of hot conflicts in the 
continent, within the framework of cooperation between the OAU 
and the United Nations. [passage omitted]

of the Republic of Namibia starting 16 June at the invitation of 
President Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali. The statement said: 
  On this occasion the two state presidents, in an amicable 
atmosphere, held a series of talks which allowed them to look 
into bilateral relations and means to strengthen them and to 
exchange views on current affairs on both the African and world 
arenas. They both expressed their satisfaction at the ideal 
ties that link their two brotherly countries and their strong 
commitment to African solidarity and human values and their firm 
determination to bolster democracy and human rights. [passage 
omitted] 
  The two leaders reviewed current affairs at the regional and 
international levels; they recorded with satisfaction their 
agreement over the various issues discussed. In this context, 
they reiterated their commitment to the principles and goals of 
the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity [OAU] 
and decided to intensify consultations between officials from 
the two countries during bilateral meetings and international 
and regional conferences. [passage omitted] 
  The two presidents stressed the importance of the 
resolutions 
issued by the OAU Tunisian summit and which are to bolster peace 
and cooperation in Africa and promote Africa's role on the world 
arena. 
  Regarding the situation in Africa, presidents Ben Ali and 
Nujoma expressed their satisfaction at the efforts made towards 
a peaceful settlement of all the conflicts in the continent in 
order to create a suitable atmosphere for peace, security, and 
development. They also expressed their satisfaction at the 
success of the democratic process in South Africa, an event 
which would give the African continent a positive impetus at the 
political and economic levels. The two presidents discussed the 
Rwandan crisis and expressed satisfaction at the indications of 
detente, manifested in the agreement of the two parties to halt 
hostilities, and expressed their wish that dialogue would help 
achieve national reconciliation in this African country. 
  Regarding the situation in the Middle East, the Namibian and 
Tunisian presidents hailed the brave struggle fought by the 
Palestinian people to establish its independent state on its 
land and expressed satisfaction at the positive and encouraging 
progress in the Middle East peace process according to UN 
resolutions.

  [Text] Kabul, June 18 (AFP) -- Afghan Prime Minister 
Golboddin Hekmatyar has called for preliminary peace talks, to 
coincide with a ceasefire and the reopening of blockaded 
national highways, a government official said Saturday. 
  Shams, the deputy foreign minister, said Hekmatyar had 
agreed 
Friday to attend a special conference to decide the future 
leadership of Afghanistan, but had called for a preliminary 
peace meeting first. 
  According to last year's Islamabad and Jalalabad peace 
accords, the terms of office of both Hekmatyar and his rival 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani expire on June 28. 
  "We need to do something before this date in order to avoid 
a 
power vacuum," Shams noted. 
  A senior pro-Rabbani commander, Ismael Khan, the governor of 
Herat Province, met with Hekmatyar outside Kabul on Thursday and 
invited the prime minister to attend a leaders' conference in 
Herat to explore ways of ending the ongoing power struggle, 
which has provoked steady fighting in Kabul since January 1. 
  "The preliminary meeting is to decide among other things 
about this venue, but Hekmatyar has no objection to Herat," 
Shams told AFP, adding that he was to meet Hekmatyar later 
Saturday to finalise details of the proposed preliminary meeting. 
  But with time running out fast, and with no announcement by 
Rabbani that he will step down at he end of the month, observers 
here said the odds were against either Hekmatyar's "preliminary" 
meeting or the proposed leaders' conference taking place. 
  Meanwhile, Kabul was quiet Saturday after heavy fighting 
late 
Friday in the south and west of the capital. 
  Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction guerrillas based in south 
Kabul's Darulaman Palace said they were observing a ceasefire 
from Saturday but reported heavy fighting Friday night between 
Hezb and the Shiite Harakat-e Eslami faction, which is allied to 
Rabbani. 
  To the west, near the now deserted Kabul University, the 
other Shiite faction, Hezb-e Wahdat, which is nominally allied 
to Hekmatyar, fought with pro-Rabbani troops overnight, 
according to residents. 
  Heavy weapons' fire was traded for more than eight hours, 
but 
there were no immediate reports of casualties.

  [Text] Islamabad, June 18, IRNA -- A spokesman for 
Golboddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami (Islamic Party) of 
Afghanistan Ghariburrahman Saeed [name as received] here 
Saturday [18 June] rejected Herat Governor Esmail Khan's 
proposal on Friday concerning convention of a session in Herat 
attended by Afghan party leaders. 
  Talking to IRNA in Peshawar Saturday Saeed said that 
convening of any seminar and participation in it would be 
"useless" and the sole way out of the current crisis is Afghan 
President Borhanoddin Rabbani's stepping down from power. 
  He called on Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to end the 
ongoing crisis in Afghanistan by forcing Rabbani to abide by 
Islamabad agreement and quit power. 
  Based on the agreement, signed by Afghan Mojahedin groups 
here on March 8, 1993 in presence of representatives of Iran, 
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Rabbani should abandon the 
presidential post by June 28 or would be compelled to do so by 
the said countries. 
  Esmail Khan along with governors of 15 other Afghan 
provinces 
had launched efforts from early last week to find a solution to 
put an end to the differences between Afghan Mojahedin groups. 
  He had in his proposal called on Afghan belligerent parties 
to participate in a conference in Herat to explore a peace 
formula.

  [Text] A spokesman for Afghanistan's president announced in 
Kabul on Sunday [19 June] that Mr. Rabbani is neither thinking 
of continuing to work as the president, nor he is thinking of 
resigning. He is rather thinking that a legal authority would 
be found to take a decision on the future presidency of 
Afghanistan. The term of office of Borhaboddin Rabbani, as the 
president, and Golboddin Hekmatyar, as the prime minister, 
should end in less than 10 days' time, on the basis of decisions 
made by the Islamabad and Jalalabad meetings. 
  At the same time a member of the mediation team from the 
southwestern sector of Afghanistan, Dr. Shams, whose objective 
is to resolve the country's crisis through peaceful means, said 
today that this team has carried out the second round of its 
mediatory talks with Rabbani and Hekmatyar on Saturday and 
Sunday, and it has been agreed the two sides' representatives 
should begin direct talks from Monday. He expressed the hope 
that during the first round of talks between the representatives 
of Afghanistan's president and prime minister, the time of 
cease-fire and the time of opening the routes leading to Kabul 
would be determined and declared. 
  Dr. Shams said: Almost all the leaders of Afghanistan's 
jihad 
groups have announced that they will take part at the 
consultative and decision-taking session of Herat; and it is 
very much hoped that peace would be established in Afghanistan.

  [Text] Khartoum, 17 June (SUNA) -- U.S. President Bill 
Clinton's envoy, Melissa Wells, will head for Washington to 
submit her report to the U.S. Administration on the talks she 
held with President Lieutenant General al-Bashir and the heads 
of the four Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and 
Development states, which concentrated on the issue of peace and 
humanitarian affairs. 
  The U.S. envoy left Sudan on 15 June for Nairobi to meet 
with 
rebel leaders, thereby completing her report, which will embrace 
the different viewpoints on the issues of relief and peace. 
  This was stated in Sudan by Mityang Malwal, the director of 
the peace department in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
speaking in today's edition of AL INQADH AL-WATANI. 
  He said the U.S. envoy's program included another mission on 
the issue of relief, which would take her to Geneva to hold 
talks with international donor agencies. His excellency the 
ambassador said that he accompanied the U.S. envoy to Kadugli in 
southern Kurdufan state, and to Wau in the western state of Bahr 
al-Ghazal, where they toured refugee camps and learned about 
different relief organizations' activities. His excellency said 
the situation was stable, and that relief work and services to 
refugees were continuing. 
  He said the envoy listened to a report from the Catholic 
archbishop in Wau, workers from the Islamic Call organization, 
and the Muwaffaq Charitable Organization, which he said 
confirmed that there was a great degree of peaceful coexistence 
between Muslims and Christians. 
  Mr. Mityang reiterated the government's commitment to the 
passage of relief supplies, agreements on humanitarian 
activities, and the provision of food to all war victims in the 
south. 
  His excellency said the government delegation was prepared 
for the forthcoming round of negotiations in Nairobi, and denied 
reports carried by western media that hopes had dimmed over 
Sudan's participation in the forthcoming negotiations, 
especially if the government recaptured Nimule. He said Sudan 
would participate in the negotiations even if all Sudanese 
territory was liberated, because peace is the principal pillar 
upon which stability and development rest.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "President Reagan Thought Sudan Was </F>
an Asian State Neighboring India; Explosive Dialogues Between 
al-Turabi and U.S. Envoys to Khartoum"] 
  [Text] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- Melissa Wells, the 
special U.S. envoy to Sudan, yesterday left Khartoum for 
Washington concluding a three-day visit to the Sudanese capital 
during which she met with a number of Sudanese officials 
including [President] Lieutenant General 'Umar al-Bashir, to 
whom she delivered a message, and Muhammad al-Amin Khalifah, 
speaker of the Transitional National Assembly (parliament). 
  The visit coincided with significant military victories for 
the government forces against the rebels in southern Sudan, in 
which the government forces recaptured the city of Kajo Kaji and 
12 other cities and villages. 
  It has been reported that the U.S. officials who now visit 
Sudan have begun to change their old threatening tone and talk 
about improvement of relations. 
  A highly placed Sudanese source has told AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI 
that the change of tone came after heated and explosive 
dialogues between these envoys, including Assistant Secretary of 
State Pelletreau, and President al-Bashir and Dr. Hasan 
al-Turabi, the well-known Islamic figure and secretary general 
of the Arab and Islamic People's Congress. 
  The source said that in one of these dialogues Dr. al-Turabi 
told a U.S. envoy that by pursuing a course hostile to Sudan and 
its Islamic government and by criticizing the application of the 
Shari'ah [Islamic law], the United States is moving into 
quicksands dangerous to it and its interests. 
  Dr. al-Turabi made that remark after the U.S. envoys 
expressed concern about Christian human rights in Sudan and 
about violation of human rights and implementation of the 
Shari'ah. 
  The source added that Dr. al-Turabi told one of the U.S. 
envoys that Sudan is concerned about the violation of black 
rights in the United States and about the persecution of 
American Muslims; and that he reminded him that the white 
Americans had killed all Indian males and taken their women 
prisoners, and that what Sudan is doing now to preserve its 
territorial integrity was what George Washington did when he 
liberated the United States and safeguarded its territorial 
integrity. 
  Dr. al-Turabi told the envoy that some U.S. officials did 
not 
even know what Sudan was, so why this hostile attitude toward it? 
  He added that when he was foreign minister he once met 
President Ronald Reagan during President Numayri's visit to the 
United States, and he made great efforts to explain Sudan's 
location to President Reagan who thought it was adjacent to 
India. 
  The highly placed source said that Dr. al-Turabi protested 
strongly when President Bill Clinton received the British author 
Salman Rushdie, who is of Indian origin. He said that receiving 
a writer who offended the Islamic faith and the prophet was a 
provocation to the entire Islamic nation confirming a 
deep-seated grudge against Muslims. 
  The U.S. Government had addressed a strongly worded 
ultimatum 
to the Khartoum government accusing it of terrorism and of 
opening training bases for extremist organizations. President 
'Umar al-Bashir's reply to that ultimatum was that he told the 
U.S. ambassador in Khartoum that Sudan would defend itself 
against any U.S. interference and that what the Americans faced 
in Somalia and before that in Vietnam would be a "picnic" 
compared with what they would face in Sudan. 
  AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI has learned that Washington's recent 
change 
of tone came after it became certain that threatening language 
is futile with Sudanese officials. 
  It seems that the Sudanese Government has begun to react 
positively to the new U.S. line. President al-Bashir told U.S. 
Envoy Wells that his government is committed to any U.S. move to 
settle the dispute in southern Sudan peacefully. He also said 
that threats of blockade against Sudan would not help but would 
complicate the problem.

<F P=106> [Reports by Muhammad 'Allam in Cairo and Kamal Hamid and </F>
'Umar Muhammad al-Hasan in Khartoum: "Egyptian-Sudanese 
Contacts To End the Escalation"] 
  [Excerpts] AL-HAYAH has learned that unannounced 
Egyptian-Sudanese contacts are currently under way as an air of 
optimism prevails among diplomats concerned with the dossier of 
relations between the two countries that a relaxation in these 
relations is imminent in the form of mutual steps to end the 
escalation and ease the tension between the two countries, at a 
time when the Sudanese authorities seem to be considering 
reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in Cairo. 
  According to informed sources in Cairo, extensive contacts 
are currently in progress between Cairo and Khartoum on points 
of disagreement, with an interest in keeping news of these 
contacts out of the media. [passage omitted] 
  A Sudanese diplomat in Cairo has told AL-HAYAH that the 
question of the presence of Egyptian forces in Hala'ib or in 
'Arakiyin south of the 22nd parallel has not gone beyond 
informing the authorities concerned that there has been some 
transgression. He reaffirmed that his government cares about 
its relations with Egypt. [passage omitted] 
  The Sudanese diplomat said that his government's position 
"is 
that all issues without exception can be settled through 
numerous bilateral channels." 
  Meanwhile, AL-HAYAH has learned that the Sudanese 
authorities 
are considering reducing the number of Sudanese diplomats in 
Cairo in view of the tense relations between the two countries. 
  A high-ranking Sudanese official questioned by AL-HAYAH 
about 
these reports said that the government "is indeed leaning 
towards reducing the size of its diplomatic missions in the 
states where the size of representation is greater than the 
level of their relations with Sudan." He said that the 
"emphasis will be on the states with which we have vast links." 
He added that the government was about to introduce major 
changes in the Foreign Ministry's structures and organs in 
implementation of that policy. But he refused to discuss 
diplomatic missions in any particular state. 
  In another development, informed sources say that police 
forces in the Sudanese capital launched a major campaign the day 
before yesterday to assemble the homeless in Khartoum and then 
send them to military training camps before sending to the south 
to participate in the fighting there. The sources added that 10 
million Sudanese pounds have been allocated for that task.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shim'on Schiffer] </F>
  [Excerpt] The United States has informed Israel of its 
intention to open an office of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development [USAID] in East Jerusalem to oversee financial aid 
to the Palestinian Autonomy in Jericho. 
  Senior political sources in Jerusalem view the U.S. plan 
with 
concern, and the matter has been transferred to Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin to decide how Israel will respond to the U.S. 
initiative. 
  The U.S. Administration has undertaken to grant $500 million 
to the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho in the coming 
five years. USAID Director Brian Atwood is due to arrive here 
in the coming days for talks with policymakers in Jerusalem and 
with the Palestinian Authority on the establishment of an office 
in Jerusalem and ways to oversee the distribution of funds. 
  The political sources expressed concern yesterday that the 
U.S. office, which may be set up in East Jerusalem, would be 
seen as a basis for possible future recognition of East 
Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian state. 
  U.S. Ambassador Djerejian informed the Foreign Ministry in 
Jerusalem of the intention to set up the office inside the U.S. 
Consulate in the city. 
  Another item on Jerusalem: The Foreign Ministry has informed 
foreign embassies here of Israel's negative view of the 
intention to set up interests offices in Jericho to work with 
the Palestinian Authority there. It should be noted that an 
"interests office" is diplomatic jargon signifying one stage in 
official recognition between two independent entities. [passage

  [Text] Having received the blessing of senior government 
elements, Knesset House Committee Chairman Yehoshu'a Matza has 
submitted a bill prohibiting the existence of Palestinian 
institutions and societies in East Jerusalem in violation of the 
relevant basic law. The new bill says that Palestinian 
institutions inherently reject the existence of the State of 
Israel. 
  Knesset Member Matza told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that 
the officials with whom he coordinated his bill were frustrated 
by the fact that a similar bill initiated by the prime minister 
had fallen through.

  [Text] At the conclusion of his meeting with Nabil Sha'th 
at the Erez checkpoint a short while ago, Major General Amnon 
Shahaq said that Sha'th would apparently not visit Jerusalem 
tomorrow due to changes in his schedule. 
  Our correspondent Ron Nesi'el reports that Maj. Gen. Shahaq 
said that Nabil Sha'th had asked him to increase the number of 
entry permits for Palestinian workers from the autonomous areas. 
Shahaq, for his part, raised the issue of the collaborators who 
have been arrested in the autonomous areas. The two men agreed 
that this matter, as well as the issue of the Palestinian 
prisoners, would be discussed at their meeting next week. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1300 GMT on 19 June 
reports that "Maj. Gen. Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th this afternoon 
agreed that Israel and the PLO will next week launch 
negotiations on the beginning of the next stage: The gradual 
transfer of powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinian 
authorities." The report notes that "next week, the two men 
will also discuss the full implementation of the Gaza-Jericho 
First agreement and the release of all the Palestinian 
prisoners, including those who were transferred to Jericho. 
Nabil Sha'th asserted that he intended to visit Jerusalem 
tomorrow; however, this also depended on how busy he would be in 
the Gaza Strip. At any rate, Sha'th said, his intention was to 
hold a private visit and to people he described as friends, such 
as Faysal al-Husayni, visit the churches, and pray at al-Aqsa 
mosque." The report adds that "Nabil Sha'th and Maj. Gen. 
Shahaq today agreed that at the beginning of next week, 30,000 
permits to work inside Israel would be issued to the residents 
of the Gaza Strip. It was also agreed that the families of the 
Palestinian policemen would immediately be allowed to enter 
Israel. The Army will also ease the policy regarding entry and 
departure from the autonomous areas."] 
  Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that Nabil 
Sha'th's planned visit to Jerusalem and the intention to convene 
the autonomy council at the Orient House building were raised 
today at the weekly cabinet session. The speakers at the 
meeting expressed doubts as to whether the autonomy council 
would really be convened in Jerusalem. The cabinet was told 
that in general, the territories were more quiet, although the 
autonomy authorities had failed to meet the timetable for 
assuming responsibility over the residents' daily affairs. 
  The cabinet revoked the ban against signing contracts with 
South Africa following the Security Council's decision to end 
the military embargo and other restrictions against South Africa. 
  The cabinet also issued another 10,000 work permits for 
laborers from the territories. Approximately 55,000 work 
permits for Palestinians from the territories have been issued 
so far.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shagray] </F>
  [Text] Aharon Domb, a member of the Council of Jewish 
Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza sent a personal letter 
to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a few weeks ago warning him of 
plans by "the extreme and fringe right-wing" to carry out "a 
political assassination." Answering HA'ARETZ's question, Domb 
said he had no information about a specific plan, but "recently 
I have been hearing too much talk too often about despair and 
political assassinations with regard to Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin, Minister Shulamit Aloni, or other ministers." 
  Domb emphasized that he had sent his letter to Rabin as a 
private citizen, not as a council member or spokesman. Among 
other things, Domb wrote the prime minister: "Such an 
assassination, God forbid, would be very serious in all respects 
and we must do our very best to prevent it. For our part, we 
are making every possible effort, but I nevertheless see fit to 
apprise you of it." 
  In his letter Domb analyzed the feelings of despair that 
bring people to such thoughts. "As far as many Israelis are 
concerned, the lack of solidarity on your part and on that of 
most other Israeli cabinet ministers with the suffering of Jews 
in Ashdod, 'Afula, Hadera, Jerusalem, Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza 
creates a horrible sense of alienation. Many of them have 
translated this alienation into despair, and in some of them 
this despair might degenerate into extreme acts of despair with 
the potential to rock Israel's very foundations." 
  Yehi'el Leiter, director general of the council's foreign 
desk, recently published an article abroad entitled "To Avert 
the Worst." Leiter asks "Is a political assassination possible 
in Israel today?" and his answer is no. "I wish my `no' could 
be more categorical. However, we can no longer ignore the 
possibility of a lunatic political assassination attempt by a 
Jewish extremist," Leiter wrote. 
  "In the two months before the massacre in Hebron," Leiter 
recalls, "the assessments indulged in by political commentators 
were not about the likelihood of a massacre, but of the 
resurgence of a Jewish underground. What happened in the field 
totally differed from the predictions. Today, in the wake of 
the Hebron events, those same commentators are anxious about a 
second Hebron. However, this time, too, events may very well 
differ from predictions. What is at stake now is so fateful 
that a political assassination -- the most abominable and 
cowardly form of political opposition -- has become a real 
possibility, albeit appalling. A political assassination by a 
Jewish extremist," Leiter warns in his article, "deserves to be 
deplored not just on moral grounds. It will most probably spell 
an end to the entire settlement endeavor. 
  "If anybody thought the attack at the Cave of the Patriarchs 
would be so dramatic and radical as to bring about the 
suspension of the talks with the PLO, he has in the meantime 
found the exact opposite to be true: the settlers bore the 
blame, while 'Arafat reaped the fruit. If a Jew tries to hurt a 
cabinet minister, the government will have an easier time 
holding all its political opponents collectively responsible, 
and there is no doubt that it will do that. 
  "Such an event could also be used as an excuse to abolish 
the 
interim phase of the agreement, which is now being described by 
some as impractical, and proceed immediately to implement the 
final phase, or as the mayor of Hebron recently put it, `the 
final solution.'" In his article Leiter proposes that the 
government realize that the path it has adopted is leading to a 
horrible and dangerous split in the population. Addressing 
himself to the right wing, Leiter proposes to it to channel its 
wrath and anxiety into a violent civil uprising.

<F P=106> [Report by Yerah Tal] </F>
  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin intends to summon 
Minister Mikha Harish when the latter returns from abroad in 
order to demand that Harish explain his complaints to Israeli 
correspondents in the United States about the prime minister's 
ostensibly rude and insulting attitude to his ministers. 
  Officials close to the prime minister claimed that Rabin was 
furious at Harish, less over the content of his remarks then 
about the fact that he made them while on an official trip 
abroad. "The amazing thing is that Harish, who holds many 
private meetings with Rabin, never expressed any such grievances 
to the prime minister," one of Rabin's close associates said. 
  Several ministers justified Harish's criticism of Rabin, but 
insisted that their statements be kept off the record. One of 
the ministers said that Harish was not the only one who had been 
offended by boorish remarks from Rabin. 
  Ministers expressed the assessment that Harish's statements 
came in the wake of an incident between him and the prime 
minister that took place at a recent cabinet session. When 
Harish started to leave the meeting, which had gone on for a 
long time, Rabin asked him where he was going. Harish replied 
that people were just "chattering away" at the meeting while he 
had work to do. Rabin got very angry and ordered Harish to 
stay. "Listen to the idle chatter and do your work later 
tonight," Rabin told the minister who was forced to stay until 
the cabinet session was over. 
  In another instance, Rabin questioned the need for a trip 
abroad by Harish, which greatly annoyed the industry and trade 
minister. 
  Labor party sources noted that if Harish criticizes the 
prime 
minister in such an open and blunt fashion, then Rabin's 
position as Labor party chairman is indeed very shaky. On the 
other hand, a minister who supports Rabin said that Harish's 
remarks should be viewed in the context of the "future 
primaries" in the Labor party.

  [Text] At the Labor party's Central Committee [CC] meeting 
today, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin criticized both Histadrut 
trade federation officials and central committee members. He 
said that the responsibility for the party's failure in the 
recent Histadrut elections lay with the Histadrut members. 
Rabin expressed disappointment with the party's central 
committee and complained that half of its members had been 
appointed through various party machinations. However, the 
prime minister asserted, elections to change the current 
composition of the central committee would be held prior to the 
next Knesset elections. 
  Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that throughout the 
speech, the hostility between Rabin and the Labor Central 
Committee members was evident, and the prime minister's speech 
was constantly interrupted by catcalls. Yitzhaq Rabin warned 
the central committee members that if the new Histadrut 
secretary general was not nominated by August, it would mean a 
death sentence for the Histradrut sick fund. He attacked those 
who violated the party bureau's decisions with regard to 
establishing a coalition with the Ramon-Meretz Histadrut list, 
and said that there was no room in the party for people who 
broke agreements. Our correspondent adds that when Gershon 
Gelman, the secretary general of the Tel Aviv workers council, 
stepped up to the podium, Yitzhaq Rabin stood up and stormed out 
of the hall, sparking an uproar. Many participants yelled that 
because of Gelman, the Labor party had lost 40 worker council 
branches.

<F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister </F>
Peres by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen, following the 
meeting of Labor's Central Committee on 19 June; place not given 
-- recorded] 
  [Text] The crisis in the ruling party is worsening. Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin today found it difficult to have his say 
at the meeting of Labor's Central Committee due to catcalls 
directed against him by Labor members. At the same time, our 
correspondent has learned that on 21 June, Shim'on Peres will 
convene about 40 of his main supporters for a meeting the kind 
of which has not taken place in Labor for a long time. 
Relations between Rabin and Peres may be growing tense again, 
so let us hear their reactions. 
  [Begin recording] [Rosen, addressing Peres] Knesset members 
[MK's] say there is no master in Labor today. 
  [Peres] I am not an commentator on MK's. 
  [Rosen] Has the prime minister lost control over Labor? 
  [Peres] I am a cabinet member. I do not intend to criticize 
the prime minister. 
  [Rosen] If you were Labor's chairman, what would you have 
done to rehabilitate the party? 
  [Peres] When I was Labor chairman I did what I needed to do. 
Take a look at what I did. 
  [Rosen] You know that it is said now that the Peres camp is 
revived. 
  [Peres] Look, I am not prepared to deal with rumors. Let 
people speak. 
  [Rosen] Is there no truth to this? 
  [Peres] To the best of my knowledge, there are no camps in 
the party today, nor is it necessary to revive them. 
  [Rosen] Do you intend to take part in the negotiations over 
the Histadrut coalition so as to help finalize matters? 
  [Peres] If I am requested to do so, I will. I will not 
initiate this however. 
  [Rosen, addressing Rabin] The Central Committee was not so 
sympathetic to you, if I am not mistaken. 
  [Rabin] I have already said on several occasions, in better 
times too, that if I were up for election in this committee I 
would not have been elected. I was elected through primaries. 
  [Rosen] Do you believe this committee will be replaced in 
the next elections? 
  [Rabin] I assume that before the next elections we will have 
a party convention and institutions will be elected there. I 
hope these elections will be democratic. 
  [Rosen] How does one emerge from the muddle in Labor? 
  [Rabin] I am not worried. My problem is to emerge from the 
Histadrut muddle. 
  [Rosen] Do you feel there is some problem or tension between 
you and the foreign minister? 
  [Rabin] I think we have a correct work relationship. There 
is unpleasant past experience, but we are also united about the 
future. 
  [Rosen] What is the situation today then? 
  [Rabin] The situation is alright. 
  [Rosen] Do you think your attitude toward the ministers is 
usually correct? 
  [Rabin] I hope so. 
  [Rosen] Do you not hear complaints from them sometimes? 
  [Rabin] Look, I am a prime minister. I have supreme 
responsibility. When the right wing demonstrates against 
something, they demonstrate against me, not the ministers. 
Responsibility also means authority. [end recording]

said this evening that the postponement of Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's visit does not point to a deadlock in 
negotiations with Syria. Christopher wants a little more 
progress to be achieved before the visit, and he apparently 
decided to wait a little while longer, Peres said.

<F P=106> [From the "I Saw, I Heard" column by Amnon Barzilay: "This </F>
Is Christopher, Not Kissinger"] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Relations between the Israeli 
and the U.S. Governments have never been better. This is the 
gist of a document drafted by the Foreign Ministry's Policy 
Planning Division on relations between the two countries. The 
threat of U.S. pressure has always hovered over Israel's head; 
however, according to the document, which is classified as 
secret, this threat has been withdrawn because of the 
breakthrough in the peace talks. Washington considers Israel an 
ally. 
  The most important piece of news regards the annual U.S. 
aid, 
to the tune of $3 billion. Until about a year ago, there was 
talk of a certain gradual reduction in U.S. foreign aid. The 
Policy Planning Division believes that the United States has no 
intention of cutting foreign aid to Israel. The division even 
goes as far as stating that "there is a promise that if Israel 
becomes more vulnerable, the United States will agree to give 
(Israel) more aid and more access to technology." It may be 
assumed, therefore, that the scope of the foreign aid Israel 
receives will only be changed in one of two instances: If the 
Israeli Government halts the political process, the aid will be 
cut. If, on the other hand, it should decide to "take 
additional risks" -- a euphemism for a withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights -- the United States may increase the aid. 
  And yet, one aspect of the Foreign Ministry document casts a 
shadow on Israeli-U.S. relations. It has to do with the U.S. 
secretary of state's determination to promote the peace talks 
with Syria. These remarks, worded very vaguely, caused a slight 
shock in Jerusalem and in the Israeli Embassy in Washington. 
The embassy decided to react, because Itamar Rabinovich is not 
only the ambassador but he also heads the Israeli team on the 
talks with Syria. 
  A week ago, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres received a 
classified telegram from Rabinovich, written after a 
consultation was held at the embassy. Some of the senior 
embassy political staff claimed that the Planning Division 
document was politically inspired by Foreign Ministry officials. 
The embassy agrees that the U.S. Administration does not 
attribute the same degree of importance to foreign policy as did 
previous administrations. The debate is about whether 
Christopher is doing enough. The document makes one feel that 
Planning Division personnel are not convinced that the Americans 
can be trusted to use the momentum in order to bring about a 
breakthrough in the negotiations with Syria. 
  The Washington embassy discussion ended with different 
conclusions. It is true that the negotiations with Syria are 
stuck and that things will move slower than expected, but the 
embassy does not believe that this delay poses a threat to the 
entire process. 
  The ambassador's report to his political staff indicates 
that 
there never was a situation in which the American peace team was 
not attentive or ready to take action to promote peace. Embassy 
staffers claim that the ball is indeed in the Syrian court. 
This is the stage at which al-Asad is called upon to come up 
with better answers for Israel. Therefore, there is nothing 
wrong with the secretary of state delaying his visit as long as 
al-Asad is not delivering the goods. 
  Washington has discerned signals of distress in Syria -- for 
example, in the Syrian media attacks on Israel last week. Syria 
is concerned about the progress in the process with the 
Palestinians and the developments between Israel and Jordan. 
Christopher's delayed Middle East visit made al-Asad feel 
pressured. If Israel also pushes Christopher, the embassy said, 
it will be asking for pressure in return. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Article signed DF: "Mr. Shim'on Peres on the Middle East </F>
-- More a Philosopher Than a Politician"] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  "Let Us Not Build the Future on Yesterday's </H5>
Ramparts" 
  As a guest of Mr. Armand Clesse and the Institute for 
European and International Studies [IEEI], Mr. Shim'on Peres 
captivated a large and attentive audience at noon yesterday [14 
June] in the European Center's amphitheater. 
  The initiator of the Gaza and Jericho agreements and a 
tireless champion of peace in the Middle East, Israel's foreign 
minister did not disappoint his audience. Quite the opposite! 
His philosophy of life, his analysis of the region's future, 
his views on the past are a splendid lesson in political dignity 
and human warmth. 
  After the session was declared open by Armand Clesse, 
[Luxembourg] Foreign Minister and long-time friend Jacques Poos 
introduced Shim'on Peres to the assembly. He praised his 
Israeli counterpart, a pioneer of the State of Israel, a man who 
studied with David Ben-Gurion, an activist and official in 
Israel's Socialist Party, a military expert, a former prime 
minister, and the mastermind of Operation Jonathan which freed 
Jews held hostage on Entebbe Airport in 1984. 
  But Shim'on Peres is much more than all this, as Jacques 
Poos 
did not fail to point out. Above all, as key negotiator with 
the PLO, it was he who brought about the historic agreement 
signed in Washington, he who made it possible for one of the 
ideas he holds dearest to his heart to come true: the process 
toward Palestinian self-determination and the surrender of the 
occupied territories. The Gaza-Jericho agreement is a crowning 
achievement for this visionary and genuine champion of peace. A 
man, as Jacques Poos pointed out, who understood that economic 
interdependence is peace's strongest bulwark, much stronger than 
any diplomatic or military treaty. 
  "The Luxembourg Government and myself wish you good luck for 
the future," the Luxembourg foreign minister concluded. 
<H5>  The Lesson of Communism's Failure </H5>
  "I am neither as good as you believe nor as bad as you say." 
Such was Mr. Peres' humorous opening remark. Everything that 
happened in the Soviet Union was unexpected. Experts are always 
more adept with the past than the future. The Communist regime 
suddenly collapsed in the USSR without external intervention. 
In South Africa, or earlier in Argentina, change occurred in 
the same way. From the inside, because the time was ripe. 
  Mr. Peres noted that communism's failure has caused a series 
of changes which have left us bewildered, in a way. Our 
traditional foes and the dangers they represented do not exist 
any more and at the same time our traditional landmarks have 
disappeared and we lack ready-made recipes for solving new 
problems. It used to be easy for a U.S. president to get 
Congress to allocate the money needed to fight Communism. But 
convincing Congress to mobilize against nuclear perils is a 
different matter. 
<H5>  What Did Communism's Failure Bring? </H5>
  The fall of communism showed that a modern power and economy 
have nothing whatsoever to do with a philosophy, and that there 
is no relationship between a country's geographical dimension 
and its intelligence. Of course, Shim'on Peres added with a 
smile, the gap between the intelligence of the Russian people 
and the lack of intelligence of Communist leaders was never more 
conspicuous than in the former Soviet Union. 
  From the moment that size loses its value, the importance of 
armies and wars becomes very small. Indeed, one cannot conquer 
intelligence. As a result, we are on the verge of a new age and 
attitude. Notions of borders, sovereignty, political regimes 
become fuzzy. One has to admit that there are much more 
important factors, such as science, economics, information, 
habits, clean air. 
<H5>  The Impact of Information </H5>
  The most significant revolution we have known in the second 
half of this century is the information revolution. Any 
dictatorship loses power as soon as it becomes impossible to 
conceal its reality. And information flows through borders, it 
brings up questions we must answer. No one can stop it, says 
Shim'on Peres, and we had better look at new thinkers rather 
than old enemies. This is true for the Middle East as for the 
rest of the world. 
  To think rather than to remember, this is what matters. 
Because memory, according to Mr. Peres, is very flexible. 
<H5>  A Peaceful Region </H5>
  Thus the agreements entered into with Egypt or the 
Palestinians -- bilateral agreements -- already belong to the 
past, as it were. The contention between Israel and the 
Palestinians was not all that serious, he said. And yet it 
turned into one of the most complicated problems of the second 
half of the twentieth century. However, he added, we shall have 
no peace as long as the Middle East as a whole has not become a 
peaceful region, since peace cannot stop at borders either. And 
missiles overtake it easily. As an example, Mr. Peres refered 
to a missile launched in Moscow which can hit Washington six 
minutes later. 
  The solution is obvious: A regional arrangement is needed. 
This requires economic development. And a modern economy 
cannot be based on the past, be it only because competition 
takes over domination. Therefore what is needed is technology 
and the ability to innovate. To win, Mr. Peres said, one must 
create. Because economics can also generate trouble. For 
instance, Israel would be seriously mistaken to believe it 
exists in a vacuum and forget about what is happening around it. 
<H5>  A Common Market </H5>
  What the Middle East needs is a common market, Mr. Peres 
explained. "Marshall Plans" are no longer appropriate. Such a 
plan would be a waste of money. On the contrary, what is needed 
is money to fuel the economy. 
  He reminded his audience that in the Middle East, $1 
trillion 
is spent on weaponry. Half of this colossal amount would have 
been enough to save all the countries in the region. 
  How can a common market be created? By remembering the 
origins of the EEC, and by gradually building common structures. 
  Mr. Peres advocated a step-by-step approach, the first two 
steps being tourism development and a solution to the irrigation 
problem. 
  Developing tourism is relatively easy, he said. This is a 
light industry and the Middle East's architectural heritage is a 
major asset. For instance, one could think of a tour including 
Egypt's pyramids, the Petra Palaces in Jordan, and Jerusalem. 
This would be a tangible approach to regional development. "If 
I must choose between 10,000 blue berets and 10,000 tourists," 
he said subsequently, "I would obviously choose the tourists." 
  As for irrigation, he points out that the region's 
population 
doubles every 14 years. And 89 percent of the region is already 
in a state of desertification. Turning this space into fertile 
land would be a major progress. Mr. Peres indicated that in 25 
years, Israel has managed to increase its soil 12-fold. 
  Water is not an insoluble problem, Shim'on Peres said. This 
is the only way to guarantee a new future for the next 
generations. 
<H5>  Europe Can Help </H5>
  Politically, a CSCM [Conference on Security and Cooperation 
in the Mediterranean] should be created based on a three-pronged 
foundation: security, economy, and human rights. Europe must 
play a role in this, it must take part in the construction of 
the Middle East. If it made use of its over-productivity which 
creates unemployment, if firms -- and many of them have enough 
money for this -- came and invested in the region, [Europe 
would] succeed in ridding itself of its excessive productivity 
while helping the Middle East, Mr. Peres stressed. And he 
suggested combining two investment types: public and private. 
He considered this a worthwhile approach for the future. 
  Mr. Peres concluded by saying that we are nearing the end of 
the century. Its first half was difficult, plagued with war, 
and the Holocaust. Its second half could prove more auspicious 
if we succeed in changing our behavior before it is too late, 
and if we surrender our urge to build the future on yesterday's 
ramparts.

  [Text] Na'im Asher, Israeli ambassador to the ROK, 
expressed worry over the fact that North Korea is selling 
long-range Scud missiles to Middle East countries, such as 
Syria, Iran, and Libya. 
  In an interview with an Israeli radio station, Ambassador 
Asher expressed worry by saying that Israel has had a bad 
experience with North Korea, which is selling dangerous Scud 
missiles to Middle East countries. 
  Ambassador Asher pointed out that in the past Israel 
contacted North Korea to stop its export of weapons to the 
Middle East region, but realized Israel lacked the capability to 
persuade North Korea. He said that U.S. efforts to apply 
sanctions against the North take Israel's interests into account.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Gadi Sukenik] </F>
  [Text] Only a handful of top political officials in Israel 
were party to the secret, but even they were surprised when 
(Tengku Abdullah), also known as Sultan Abdullah, landed in 
Israel on 12 June. Abdullah is the brother of the Malaysian 
king. He is a member of parliament and is very close to Prime 
Minister Mahathir. This was quite a surprise, considering that 
with the exception of Iran, Malaysia is -- or at least was -- 
one of the toughest nuts for Israel to crack. 
  Malaysia is a Muslim country with a population of 
approximately 20 million. There is no Jewish community. The 
capital is Kuala Lumpur. The supreme ruler is King Muhibbuddin. 
Longstanding Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamed, who is second 
in command, is the country's real strongman. 
  The Israeli Foreign Ministry's semiofficial representative 
was expelled from Malaysia back in 1966. Since then, there has 
been no contact whatsoever between the two countries, and 
Malaysia's leadership has adopted a vehemently hostile 
anti-Israeli and overtly anti-Semitic line. Malaysia's rulers 
recognized the State of Palestine back in the 1980's and 
established close relations with Iran. They declared that 
Malaysia would never make peace with Israel, even if the Arabs 
did. When former President Herzog visited neighboring 
Singapore, Malaysia recalled its ambassador from that country 
and almost severed diplomatic relations with it. Even the movie 
Schindler's List, which is about the Holocaust, was banned as 
Jewish propaganda. 
  The brother of the Malaysian ruler arrived in Israel 
accompanied by a Jewish businessman, who served as a mediator. 
There is no doubt that Sultan Abdullah's visit was undertaken 
with the knowledge and approval of the Malaysian leadership. On 
Sunday, the Malaysian official met with the foreign minister 
before Mr. Peres flew abroad. On 14 June, the Malaysian official 
met with Prime Minister Rabin. He left Israel yesterday after 
touring the country between meetings. Despite the veil of total 
secrecy surrounding the matter, we have learned that Malaysia is 
already expressing readiness in principle to establish business 
and economic ties with Israel. Once sufficient progress is made 
in the peace process, diplomatic ties will follow. 
  This is one of the most succulent pieces of fruit Israel has 
reaped from the agreement with the Palestinians so far, along 
with the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Vatican. 
There is significant economic potential here, which goes far 
beyond the breaching of yet another fanatical Muslim wall of 
hostility. Although Malaysia has sacrificed democracy and civil 
rights in exchange for political stability, it has achieved an 
incredible level of economic prosperity. Its economy is growing 
at a tremendous rate with no unemployment, and its natural 
resources guarantee a rosy future. It goes without saying that 
when asked, all the Israeli officials who played a role in this 
affair refused to make any comment.

  [Text] Israeli warplanes attacked the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
region in the south at 1125 today, targeting Mlita and 
al-Luwayzah with two successive raids. Israeli warplanes 
continue to fly over the area. 
  Israeli warplanes fired four air-to-surface missiles on 
Mlita 
Hill at 1110. The Lebanese Army opened fire on the planes. The 
Israeli air raids were accompanied and preceded by intensive air 
activity over al-Nabatiyah and Iqlim al-Tuffah. 
  At 1105 the warplanes fired two rockets on Jabal Safi in 
Iqlim al-Tuffah. 
  The air raids have caused an atmosphere of fear and panic 
among the citizens, who have remained in their homes. There are 
no reports of casualties yet. Only material damage has been 
done.

  [Text] Lebanese Army units continue to be deployed in 
specific areas in [Jabal Lubnan]. Military sources told the 
NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY that the deployment process will continue 
for three days. They said that approximately 8,000 officers and 
personnel from the 3d, 6th, 10th, and 11th brigades and the 3d 
intervention regiment have been deployed in several villages 
beginning from Qabb Ilyas. 
  The Lebanese Army Guidance Directorate issued the following 
statement: 
  Within the framework of implementing the council of 
ministers' resolutions relating to consolidating security, 
extending the state authority, and returning displaced people to 
their homes and villages, at dawn today the Lebanese Army began 
the final deployment operations in Jabal Lubnan from the 
al-Awwali river in the south and the Upper al-Matn area in the 
north. The objectives and tasks of this operation are to create 
a suitable and permanently secure atmosphere and a return to a 
normal life for the return of the displaced people to their 
homes, and to strengthen national coexistence, which is one of 
the main components of accord. 
  On this occasion, the army command calls on the citizens, 
both returnees and residents, to contribute to this historic 
event, bring about family reunions, renounce past grudges, and 
aspire to a prosperous future for themselves and their sons 
under the umbrella of security, law, and justice.

<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Lebanese Army Guidance Directorate </F>
on 18 June; place not given] 
  [Text] Lebanese Army units have carried out the first phase 
of the deployment process in Jabal Luban areas to secure the 
return of the displaced people to their homes. The second and 
third phases will be completed by tomorrow evening. Army 
Commander General Emile Lahhud this morning inspected the forces 
and units taking part in the deployment and gave them directives 
to take care of the affairs of the citizens, both returnees and 
residents, to facilitate their affairs, and to create the 
necessary security atmosphere conducive to the safe return and 
brotherhood among the people. 
  The army's step in deploying in Jabal Lubnan and al-Shuf 
today was met with great satisfaction by officials and citizens, 
who commended the role of the army, its commander, and the units 
that have been deployed to towns and villages since morning. 
These units continue to deploy to specific areas in the Jabal 
Lubnan and al-Shuf areas. 
  Military sources told the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY that the 
deployment process will continue for three days, today, 
tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. They said that 
approximately 8,000 officers and soldiers from the 3d, 6th, 
10th, 11th brigades, and the 3d intervention regiment have been 
deployed to several villages since dawn today. They noted that 
the towns and villages where the army deployed and will be 
deployed are: 'Ammatur, Niha, 'Ayn Zhalta, Nab' al-Safa, 
Ba'lshmayh, al-Baruk, al-Knaysah, Binwati, Wadi al-Dayr, (Wadi 
Dayr Durit), (Wadi Bnahlayh), al-Na'imah, al- Damur, Ra's 
al-Harf, 'Alayh, Bhamdun, Tarshish, Bmaryam, Salima, Arsun, Kafr 
Him, Ra's al-Matn, Ma'asir al-Shuf, Ma'sir Bayt al-Din, Mazra'at 
al-Dahr, al-Jahiliyah, Brih, Batlun, al-Mtullah, Furn 
al-Shubbak, al-Shiyah, 'Ayn al-Rummanah, Tahwitat al-Nahr, and 
Hammana. 
  These sources said that there are two main objectives in the 
army's mission: First to ensure the return of the displaced 
people to the aforesaid towns and villages under normal 
circumstances, and to guarantee their safety, establish 
security, bring about reassurance, and prevent unlawful acts and 
encroachment on property. Second, to offer assistance and social 
services to the returnees and station detachments from the 
engineering and signal corps and conscripts to accompany the 
returnees and contribute to their security and resumption of 
normal life.

<F P=106> [Interview with Housing Affairs Minister Walid Junblatt by </F>
unidentified correspondent on 19 June; place not given -- 
recorded] 
  [Excerpt] [Junblatt] I have already explained that the Army 
has been present in the mountains. In agreement and 
coordination with Army Commander General Emile Lahhud, the Army 
has been reinforced. However, the Lebanese media have described 
the matter as if the Army has entered a forbidden area. This is 
wrong. The Army and the internal security forces have been 
there. The refugees began to return last year. They will 
continue to return where they can with the help of the ministry 
and the Army. 
  [Correspondent] Do you consider what happened yesterday and 
today a reinforcement of the Army's presence? 
  [Junblatt] This is a new security plan. I have personally 
asked for some action to give assurances [to the returnees]. 
There are steps that have been taken by the Army for reasons 
only known to it. We do not deal in the Army's military 
affairs. However, the Army has been there. What is the reason 
for all this drum beating and trumpeting as if the Army has 
entered the Israeli- occupied south? [passage omitted]

indictment in the two cases have been issued. 
  Meanwhile, Lebanon is seeking the extradition of Ghassan 
Tuma, head of the Lebanese Forces' Intelligence Department, from 
the United States. Ghassan Tuma is accused of assassinating 
Sham'un and therefore is an important link in revealing all the 
implications of the case.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Baghdad Offers Tehran Alliance </F>
Against `Common Enemies'"] 
  [Text] London, Tehran, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraq has 
hinted at the possibility of making an offer to Iran regarding 
"a strategic alliance" against what it termed "common enemies." 
  The Iraqi offer is expected to be discussed in detail on the 
occasion of a visit to Iraq by a high-level Iranian delegation 
early next month. The delegation will prepare for a visit by 
Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, who will be the 
first Iranian minister to visit Iraq since 1978. 
  Trade and political contacts between Iran and Iraq have 
rapidly increased over the past 18 months following the two 
neighboring states' adoption of positive rapprochement when 
dealing with another. And it seems that Tehran is now convinced 
that a change in Iraq's leadership in current conditions would 
not serve Iran's long-term interests. 
  This is why Tehran is expressing its willingness to help 
Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to improve his position at least 
for the time being. 
  The two sides are working on a number of issues of "common 
interest," including the reopening of the Shatt al-'Arab 
waterway, which will enable the Iraqi port of al-Basrah and the 
Iranian port of Khorramshahr to resume their activities fully. 
  Both Tehran and Baghdad are aspiring to secure "a legal 
framework" for the border trade which is rapidly growing between 
them and whose volume is estimated at about $1.2 billion a year. 
This trade is conducted mostly by smugglers, and it supplies the 
Iraqi market with a wide range of commodities, including food 
and consumer durables. 
  The two sides are agreed in their determination to prevent 
the establishment of a separate Kurdish entity in northeast Iraq. 
  Iranian sources say that tightening the noose around the 
Kurdish "safe area" in north Iraq has become one of Tehran's 
priorities. And French oil companies are putting pressure on 
Iraq to normalize its relations with Iran so that work can begin 
in rich oilfields like the Majnun islands and Nahr 'Umar. 
  Costs of developing these oilfields are expected to reach 
about $12 billion over six years. Two giant French oil 
companies, namely Elf-Aquitaine and Total, have reached "initial 
agreements" with Iraq to develop these fields. Iraq must assure 
investors that the state of conflict with Iran has ended in 
order to secure the huge capital needed for this project, as 
most of the main Iraqi oil wells are situated near the border 
with Iran. 
  A project currently under study is expected to export Iraqi 
oil via the Iranian province of Khuzestan, thus avoiding Turkish 
territory and Syria, which Iraq regards as an archenemy. 
Besides, exporting Iraqi oil via Iranian territory makes it 
difficult for the United States and its allies to cut off Iraqi 
oil exports as a means of putting pressure on Baghdad. 
  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati announced 
yesterday that an Iranian Foreign Ministry delegation will visit 
Iraq "within the coming two weeks" to continue the discussions 
over normalizing relations between Baghdad and Tehran. 
  Velayati stressed that he is still hoping to go to Baghdad 
in 
July despite the delay in the Iranian mission's preparations for 
his visit.

  [Text] As announced during the news bulletin, the second 
round of Tajik peace talks began today in Tehran with a speech 
by Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati. We draw your attention to 
our correspondent's report on this. 
  [Correspondent] During the inaugural session that was held 
with the participation of an envoy of the United Nations 
secretary general, Mr. Velayati -- stressing the Islamic 
Republic of Iran's efforts to establish a just peace in 
Tajikistan -- considered the existence of common cultural, 
historical, religious, and linguistic bonds between the two 
nations to be an indication of their ancient ties. 
  Referring to the regretful crisis in Tajikistan, he stressed 
the need for establishing stability in the Central Asian states 
and said: The establishment of peace and stability in that 
region is one of the priorities of Iran's foreign policy with 
regard to the expansion of cooperation with the Central Asian 
states. Mr. Velayati added: We believe the resolution of the 
Tajik crisis to be the bright spot of regional cooperation for 
peaceful coexistence with regional states. 
  In conclusion, our country's foreign minister called for a 
more active participation by the world states in offering 
economic assistance after the establishment of peace in 
Tajikistan. 
  During the course of the session, Mr. Ramero Piriz Ballon, 
the UN secretary general's envoy at the Tajikistan peace talks, 
called for a more active role by international organizations, 
stressing the need to end the crisis in Tajikistan. He said: 
The realization of peace in Tajikistan will not be achieved 
without taking into consideration the wishes of all the parties. 
  Expressing his pleasure over the fact that the two sides 
have 
now realized that the only way to achieve peace is through the 
continuation of talks and by finding peaceful means, Mr. Ballon 
said: The establishment of grounds for mutual trust is one of 
the factors that can play a role in the promotion of the talks. 
  Mr. Gyurov, representative of the Tajik Government, the 
third 
speaker at the session, stressing Iran's good intentions in its 
past efforts in realizing peace in Tajikistan, said: We good 
progenies of Ferdosi and Khayyam [famous Iranian poets] and 
other great Farsi speakers are prepared to achieve fundamental 
solutions for the Tajik crisis through peaceful means in our 
ancestral homeland. He added: The Tajik nation is in need of 
stability and tranquillity today, and we hope to attain a 
definite result in these talks. 
  The last speaker at today's session was Mr. Latifi, the 
opposition group representative. Stressing that various 
dimensions of the Tajik catastrophe are still hidden, he said: 
International forums have only uncovered a sad corner of this 
regrettable tragedy. Stressing that opposition groups do not 
seek bloodshed, he said: We stress the territorial integrity of 
Tajikistan and hope the talks will bear results as soon as 
possible and that the Muslim people of Tajikistan will be 
liberated from this disaster. 
  Finally, the representative of the opposition forces at the 
peace talks thanked Iran for its pivotal role in realizing peace 
in Tajikistan. 
  Present at the second round of Tajikistan peace talks in 
Tehran were representative of Iran, Russia, Afghanistan, 
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, the CSCE, and the 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as heads of the 
diplomatic missions of foreign countries residing in Tehran. 
  At the end of the inaugural session, Mr. Velayati and the UN 
secretary general's envoy participated in a joint news 
conference. At that news conference, the secretary general's 
envoy--stressing the need for the return of stability to 
Tajikistan--said: We intend to create the necessary conditions 
for free elections by creating grounds conducive for them. He 
expressed the hope that the establishment of peace in Tajikistan 
will have positive effects on Afghan issues. 
  Mr. Velayati, answering a question on whether Iran will send 
a peacekeeping force to Tajikistan, stressed Iran's continued 
impartial policy regarding the Tajik crisis and said: If the 
United Nations makes a request to Iran, there is no obstacle in 
the way of sending forces to Tajikistan.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati by </F>
unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] What is the major problem in the way 
of peace in Tajikistan? 
  [Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the 
merciful [preceding phrase in Arabic]. The main problem is the 
lack of mutual understanding, which has been available since the 
very beginning of negotiations. But this problem needs time to 
be solved. I mean, if we want to solve this problem we need 
more time. If you take a look at the result of the talks that 
they had in Moscow and also the preliminary statement that they 
had in ceremonial session, you will see that may be there are 
some progress. As I said in my interview, at the beginning they 
were not ready to talk together. And both of them used to be 
very angry against another one. Now the nature of their 
presence is a positive step which has been taken by them. So we 
can say that cautiously we are optimistic and we do hope that 
after few days of talks they can reach some more positive 
points. This is the national desire of the people of 
Tajikistan. They want to put an end to these internal conflict 
because they have lost many lives and they are facing, the 
people of Tajikistan are facing a national disaster. They have 
difficulties even for providing the raw material for their very 
simple life. Lack of sanitation, lack of food, lack of 
transportation, continuation of killing and slaughters and 
assassination have made the people of Tajikistan frustrated. 
People are very disappointed. That is the national desire that 
now the time is ripe for a national reconciliation. 
  [Correspondent] It seems no specific plan for restoring 
peace 
in Tajikistan has been offered. Do you think a clear peace plan 
will come under discussion in the current round of negotiations 
in Tehran? 
  [Velayati] Of course, this is the task of the special envoy 
of the secretary general of the United Nations. But as far as 
we could understand of what he has said he has tried to make a 
cease-fire at the beginning as a fist step; because the 
establishment of the cease-fire will give opportunity to both 
sides for continuation of talks and decreasing of tension; while 
the continuation of assassination and killing and slaughters 
will increase tension. And if tension is increased or is being 
increased they cannot stop the hostility. So, the cease-fire is 
the first step that should be established unconditionally, 
without any precondition. That's what we could understand from 
the special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations.

  [Text] Tehran, June 18, IRNA -- A representative of Tajik 
opposition groups to Iranian-sponsored peace talks in Tehran 
said on Saturday [18 June] that the crisis in Tajikistan should 
be solved through negotiations. 
  Speaking to IRNA, Ata Khan Latifi [name as received] said 
that at present all factions involved in the crisis in 
Tajikistan have reached the conclusion that their problems 
should be solved through dialogue and negotiations. 
  Latifi said that people representing all Tajik opposition 
groups in the peace talks in Tehran would do their best to reach 
an agreement with Tajikistan's government representatives in

Tajik refugees to their home and the administrative structure of 
future Tajik government.

solution to the crisis.

  [Text] Tehran, June 18 (AFP) -- Foreign television programs 
received by satellite have been jammed in Iran since Friday [17 
June], viewers said here Saturday. 
  However the jamming of some 30 European, American and Asian 
channels has not been publicly announced. 
  Viewers said programs received via the Asia-Sat and Arab-Sat 
satellites had been garbled more or less depending on the 
district, with parallel lines appearing on TV screens. 
  The jamming follows debate in Iran on whether or not to ban 
satellite dishes, which have mushroomed on rooftops in Tehran 
and other cities allowing up to two million people to view 
foreign broadcasts. 
  Under pressure from Islamic conservatives and hardliners, 
parliament is soon to debate the issue as part of moves to check 
Western cultural influence. 
  The jamming also came after Iranian state television 
announced it would broadcast the World Cup live from the United 
States in a bid to compete with the increasingly popular 
satellite programs. 
  A newspaper reported here Thursday that in a crackdown on 
"social corruption," authorities in Iran had seized 1,965 
television satellite dishes destined for Iranian consumers.

  [Text] London--Tujan al-Faysal, member of the Jordanian 
House of Representatives, has assailed the unilateral tendency 
in the negotiations with Israel. 
  In an interview with the London-based Lebanese newspaper 
AL-HAYAH, published today, she emphasized that Jordan's interest 
lies in coordination with Syria and Lebanon. 
  Answering a question on whether Jordan is heading for a 
final 
agreement with Israel apart from Syria and Lebanon, she said: 
What I understood from the details of the closed parliamentary 
session-- in which these issues were discussed and from which I 
was absent--is that the Jordanian Government is showing 
reservations about the subject of comprehensive coordination, 
and of course I am opposed to this position. 
  She asked: Where is reason, logic, and interest when we opt 
for coordination with Israel and the Palestinian entity and 
ignore coordination with Syria and Lebanon?

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Information Minister Jawad </F>
al-'Anani, in Washington, by Muhammad al-Aswad, in Cairo; date 
not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Al-Aswad] Dr. Jawad, welcome to the Voice of the 
Arabs. 
  [Al-'Anani] Thank you. 
  [Al-Aswad] Let us begin with His Majesty King Husayn's visit 
to Washington. What will be the main topics of his discussions 
with the American officials? 
  [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn came to the United 
States 
for the medical checkup he undergoes every six months. Thank 
God, the results of the checkup were excellent. It is customary 
for his majesty to meet with senior U.S. officials during these 
medical visits. The current visit comes after reaching an 
agreement with the Israelis on border demarcation and fair water 
sharing. In light of these recent developments on the 
Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track, the visit acquires 
particular importance. 
  [Al-Aswad] There have recently been intensive 
Jordanian-Israeli contacts in Washington. As you said, the 
talks resulted in the signing of an economic agreement involving 
several projects. How far have you gone in the subject of 
border demarcation? 
  [Al-'Anani] The agreement reached two weeks ago provided for 
the formation of specialized technical subcommittees within a 
higher committee of technicians that will work in the field to 
demarcate the border, divide the water, and work out security 
measures. This will begin in July. 
  [Al-Aswad] So, the news about an agreement on the 
demarcation 
of the Jordanian-Israeli border is true. Is this a departure 
from the known Jordanian principles concerning the peace process? 
  [Al-'Anani] Not at all. We are still committed to the joint 
agenda signed on 14 September 1993. We have never departed from 
that agenda. Moreover, we have not reached a final agreement. 
We have agreed to start border demarcation and water sharing. 
This does not mean the issue is over. We have only started 
actual field work, and we still have some way to go to reach an 
agreement on border demarcation. Technical field work must be 
done before we can say that we have reached an agreement. 
  [Al-Aswad] Dr. Jawad, how do you view the future of the 
peace 
process on the Jordanian-Israeli track and on the other 
negotiating tracks? 
  [Al-'Anani] Our position is clear. We want coordination with 
all the Arab sides and we would like to see progress on all 
tracks. His majesty will stress the need for progress on all 
tracks because we believe that partial peace is unstable peace; 
it is not lasting, comprehensive, or just. This is the point we 
are going to stress here in the United States. 
  [Al-Aswad] But is the border demarcation agreement progress 
that leaves the Syrian-Israeli track behind? 
  [Al-'Anani] No. As you remember, in all the meetings of the 
Arab cordon states in Beirut, Amman, Cairo, and Damascus it was 
stressed that it is possible for one track to move faster that 
the others, but there should be coordination and all sides must 
agree to the final results. In fact, as you know, all tracks 
are mobile; no track is fully dormant, neither the Palestinian 
nor the Syrian. But the results depend on the subjects being 
discussed. If progress is made on any of the tracks, especially 
the Jordanian track, we believe it will positively affect 
progress on other tracks. This is especially true since the 
Jordanians obtained an Israeli recognition that the cease-fire 
border is not the permanent one. The exchange of land for peace 
is the deal sought by all the Arab parties, especially since 
they all proceed from Security Council Resolution 242, which 
calls for the return of the land in exchange for peace. 
  [Al-Aswad] Can we say that an agreement on a peace treaty 
with Israel is now imminent or expected in the foreseeable 
future? 
  [Al-'Anani] I do not think so. I believe that we made a step 
toward that development, but we still have a long way to go 
before achieving it, especially if we read the items on the 
joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The discussions of some 
subjects have not started yet. 
  [Al-Aswad] What are these subjects, Dr. Jawad? 
  [Al-'Anani] For example, the refugees and the achievement of 
comprehensive agreements on all tracks. 
  [Al-Aswad] Thank you, Dr. Jawad. 
  [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has said 
His Majesty King Husayn will concentrate during the summit 
meeting he will have with U.S. President Bill Clinton next 
Wednesday on the peace process and its future in the Middle 
East, and recognition of the importance of the Jordanian role in 
this process. 
  In a statement today, he said his majesty will also discuss 
issues that contribute to enabling Jordan to carry out its role 
in the peace process in a manner that guarantees just and 
comprehensive peace on all fronts. 
  He said the Jordanian side has carried out several 
preparatory meetings with U.S. officials, and that it is clear 
that there is great recognition of Jordan's importance and its 
role in the region. He added that the Jordanian officials want 
His Majesty King Husayn's current visit to be of clear 
importance in terms of its results on the direct relations 
between the two countries, and on bolstering the peace process, 
especially since next month will witness the beginning of the 
Jordanian-Israeli technical meetings in the region on the 
demarcation of borders, water sharing of the Jordan and al- 
Yarmuk Rivers in accordance with the just shares of the parties, 
and the agreement on security measures. 
  Dr. al-'Anani said that, in his news conference next 
Tuesday, 
His Majesty King Husayn will explain the latest developments in 
the peace process and the Jordanian position on this process, 
especially that progress on the Jordanian track is in the 
interest of the peace process on all tracks.

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--A delegation of the Yemeni 
House of Representatives headed by Deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah 
al-Kibsi arrived in Baghdad today on an official visit of 
several days to Iraq. 
  In a statement to INA, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi said that 
he will meet with the National Assembly speaker, as well as the 
leaders of professional and popular organizations and parties to 
explain to them the serious implications of the violation of 
constitutional legitimacy in Yemen by the secessionists. He 
will also explain to these Iraqi officials, he noted, the 
secessionists' efforts to abort unity, for which the Yemeni 
people have made great sacrifices. 
  Al-Kibsi added: Our visit to fraternal Iraq comes in 
implementation of a decision the Yemeni House of Representatives 
has made in this regard. The objective of this decision, he 
said, is to enlighten the Arab and Muslim nation, chief among 
which are the Iraqi kinfolk and leadership represented by His 
Excellency President Saddam Husayn, the epitome of the nation's 
heroism, about the true state of affairs in Yemen. The Iraqis, 
he went on to say, are the most concerned to safeguard unity and 
democracy, and the people endowed with the best experience in 
resisting injustice and aggression, thanks to the Mother of 
Battles they have waged to deter the sinful aggressors and 
traitorous rulers, who are subservient to foreigners. 
  The Yemeni parliamentarian noted the crimes the Yemeni 
secessionists are committing against the country's unity, 
security, and safety. He added: The war is not only one 
between rebels and legitimacy forces. It is also a war aimed 
against the Arab nation to humiliate it so that the enemies may 
achieve their goals and realize their ambitions in this part of 
the Arab homeland. 
  The Yemeni official concluded by saying that the Yemeni 
government and people take pride in the pan-Arab positions of 
Iraq under His Excellency President Saddam Husayn. He also 
commended the leader president's heroic role in defending the 
causes of the Arab and Muslim nation against all forces of 
injustice, evil, and aggression that have targeted the present 
and future of this nation.

  [Text] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan has received a Yemeni parliamentary delegation led by 
Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, a member of the Yemeni House of 
Representatives. During the meeting, Taha Yasin Ramadan 
reiterated Iraq's unchanging stand on the recent events in 
Yemen. He said Iraq supports Yemeni unity and legitimacy. He 
said the enemies are working to partition united countries into 
several parts to facilitate the achievement of their colonialist 
ambitions, to control them, and to interfere in their internal 
affairs. 
  He said the unity of Yemeni territory and people is a source 
of strength for the Arab nation, and that the support extended 
to the separatists by some Arab rulers provides another piece of 
evidence that those agents' are conspiring against the Arab 
nation in a bid to dismember it, on orders from colonialist 
powers. 
  The Yemeni parliamentary delegation leader expressed high 
appreciation and great pride in the heroic stand of President 
Saddam Husayn and the great Iraqi people. He said the Iraqi 
people have become an example and a model for steadfastness and 
sacrifices, through which they have scored great victories and 
thwarted conspiracies and aggressions. He indicated that the 
Yemeni people will fight in defense of the one homeland and the 
one people, and that they will thwart this chapter of conspiracy 
against Yemen and the Arab nation. 
  Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan also received Pascal 
Jacquino [name as transliterated], head of the diplomatic and 
strategic institute in France and head of the higher school for 
the press, and his delegation. The vice president stressed that 
many states are suffering economic and security problems as a 
result of the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the continued 
blockade imposed on its people. He indicated that continued 
U.S. hegemony and efforts to implement U.S. ambitions and 
colonialist policies will jeopardize world peace and security. 
He said America's allies have lost their independent 
decisionmaking ability and their sovereignty. 
  He indicated that the disagreement of most UN Security 
Council member states with the U.S. Administration is considered 
a defeat for America and a victory for Iraq, because Iraq has 
managed to thwart all America's conspiratorial, aggressive, and 
misleading tactics on the military, economic, political, and 
propagandist fronts. 
  Taha Yasin Ramadan stressed that Iraq will remain as it has 
always been throughout history -- with a united land and people, 
Arabs and Kurds, rallying around their leader and symbol, Saddam 
Husayn and his wise and brave leadership, which has made the 
Iraqi people a model for emulation by countries that adhere to 
their principles, defend their objectives, and reject 
humiliation and subservience. 
  Pascal Jacquino expressed confidence in Iraq's prosperous 
future in view of its rich human and material potential and the 
progress that it has achieved in the march of reconstruction. 
He stressed the importance of promoting Iraqi-French relations 
in the service of the two countries' common interests.

  [Excerpts] Baghdad, 18 Jun (INA)--Muhammad 'Abdallah 
al-Kibsi, head of the Yemeni House of Representatives delegation 
[visiting Iraq], has stressed that those who are conspiring 
against the unity and independence of the Yemeni people are the 
same who are conspiring against the unity and independence of 
the people of fraternal Iraq. 
  Addressing a news conference attended by Arab and foreign 
press and television correspondents, as well as an INA 
correspondent, al-Kibsi said the Yemeni people and the 
legitimate and constitutional government today face a 
manifestation of the secessionists' opposition to the will of 
the Yemeni people, with their various segments and political and 
social forces. It is a manifestation of their rejection of the 
democratic option Yemen has chosen since the realization of 
immortal unity. [passage omitted] 
  He stressed that in the recent battles, the legitimate and 
constitutional forces achieved successive victories against the 
remnants of the separatists, who have been forced to retreat 
into Aden. He said those victories have provided new pieces of 
evidence that prove conspiratorial and treasonous coordination 
between the secessionists and Saudi Arabia and other Gulf 
states. He said the legitimate and constitutional forces have 
seized sophisticated weapons and military hardware, comprising a 
squadron of Sukhoi-22 planes, a battalion of T-72 tanks, in 
addition to 18 heavy guns, each worth over $5 million. He said 
the secessionists do not have money to purchase such weapons, 
adding that these weapons, which have been seized by the 
legitimate and constitutional forces, are categorical proof of 
the subordination of that secessionist gang to the powers that 
do not want Yemeni unity to last. [passage omitted] 
  Asked by INA about Yemen's concept regarding the Arab stand 
on Yemeni events, the stand of the legitimate and constitutional 
Yemeni leadership regarding formulas to end the war completely, 
and the military developments on the battlefield, al-Kibsi said: 
When fraternal Iraq was exposed to American aggression and to 
the blockade that is still imposed on its people, the Arabs took 
positions ranging from those who understood the Iraqi position 
and were opposed to the aggression and the blockade, to those 
who adopted the opportunistic and reactionary position of a 
lackey who did not want the Arab nation to rise via the rise of 
the Iraqis. The latter stood by the aggression on Iraq and 
mobilized all their political, material, and military resources 
against Iraq. They are repeating this stand now against the 
constitutional Yemeni government and people because they do not 
want the nation to unite. Moreover, they took this stand because 
Yemen stood by its Arab brothers in Iraq during the unjust 
aggression, despite the fact that the Yemeni events are an 
internal issue and not a dispute or war between Yemen and 
another external power. 
  Al-Kibsi said Iraq's position on the current Yemeni events 
is 
an honorable national and pan-Arab position and has had a great 
effect on the morale of the united Yemeni people. 
  Al-Kibsi said Yemen rejects any kind of interference in its 
internal affairs, including interference in the recent events, 
because what is happening in Yemen today is that secessionist 
forces are standing against the nationalist and constitutional 
forces of legitimacy, something that should be rejected by all 
patriotic, noble, and zealous Arabs. 
  Al-Kibsi said: While we are tightening the grip militarily 
on the besieged secessionists in Aden, we also support peace 
from a position of military and political capability. We are 
ready for a peaceful solution to save our people in southern 
Yemen from the perils of bloodshed. This is because the 
renegade secessionist al-Bid compels innocent citizens to 
withdraw along with him whenever there is military pressure by 
the forces of constitutional legitimacy. These forces are now 
no more than 25 km from Aden, the secessionists' major 
stronghold. 
  He said a constitutional and legitimate Yemeni dialogue 
should be held with the unionist and nationalist elements in the 
Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and not with its renegade 
secessionist elements. He pointed out that many nationalist and 
unionist socialists are now fighting alongside the forces of 
constitutional legitimacy against the secessionist gang on 
various combat fronts. Others in Aden are facing pressures by 
the intelligence elements and henchmen of the renegade 
secessionist al-Bid. 
  Al-Kibsi explained that the secessionists declared a 
government that no one recognized and that is rejected by the 
nationalists and unionists in the YSP itself. Some elements in 
this party were sentenced to death by the YSP itself. He 
pointed out that the secessionist group, which claims that it is 
the government in southern Yemen, is actually an agent of Saudi 
Arabia and it only consists of those who were in Saudi Arabia. 
No one has recognized or will recognize this group because the 
whole world, including the United Nations and the Arab League, 
recognize only the Republic of Yemen. 
  The head of the Yemeni House of Representatives delegation 
said each Yemeni citizen throughout the Yemeni homeland has much 
love and appreciation for Iraq and its leader and people for 
their sincere and honorable nationalist positions. He explained 
that his visit to Baghdad, along with the accompanying 
delegation, is part of parliamentary efforts designed to clarify 
facts about what is taking place in Yemen.

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by 'Adil Sa'd: "The Saudi Regime and </F>
Plotting Against Yemeni Unity"] 
  [Text] It is not strange for the Saudi regime to create 
false justifications in order to plot against Yemeni unity and 
to obtain regional and international supporters for the renegade 
separatists in Aden. 
  This regime, which is known for its agentry, plotting, and 
hiring of mercenaries and for its background as the outcome of a 
well-known imperialist deal, cannot but shun any Arab unionist 
trend and exploit every geographical and political factor in 
order to foster factionalism and fighting so as to protect its 
political entity first and also because such a course enables it 
to indulge in its treasonous policy. 
  What the Saudi regime has done to Yemen is known and proven 
by events and facts. It has continued to openly plot against 
Yemen from the moment the Yemenis opted for the republican 
political system. The Saudis dispatched large numbers of 
mercenaries and agents with the aim of returning Yemen to the 
era of misguidance, backwardness, and decadence. They used 
border wars, assassinations, disturbances, and economic siege. 
They expelled more than one million Yemeni workers from Saudi 
Arabia and deprived them of their properties and financial 
rights during the U.S.-Zionist aggression against Iraq. They 
also plotted against the Document of Pledge and Accord, which 
the Yemenis signed in February this year, when they received the 
renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid in order to spite Yemeni 
constitutional legitimacy and to throw a wrench into the accord 
and thus bring it to standstill. This development encouraged 
al-Bid to disavow the document and to harp once more on the tune 
of separatism. 
  The insistence of agent Fahd's regime on pushing matters in 
Yemen toward internationalization is contrary to the Arab League 
and UN charters. What has happened so far in the Security 
Council concerning Yemen also constitutes blatant interference 
in Yemen's internal affairs. 
  Real concern for Yemen calls for preserving its 
constitutional legitimacy, which has come as a result of the 
Yemeni people's democratic choice. The logic of protecting 
Yemen and preserving its security and the safety of its people 
and stemming the present copious flow of blood calls for 
safeguarding the unity of this noble Arab country, not 
encouraging separatism.

<F P=106> [Article: "This `Bandar' Is Like That `Fahd' and Both Are </F>
Soaked in Agentry" -- signed "AL-THAWRAH"] 
  [Text] If "Uncle" Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz's conspiratorial 
stands against the nation and its aspirations for unity and 
awakening are exposed and known to have been plotted by the 
United States, which brought his family to power in 
implementation of a spiteful plan against all the Arabs, the 
stands of the nephew, Bandar Bin-Sultan, are similar to the 
dirty stands of the uncle, and they are all directed against 
will of the Arab nation. 
  The moment you mention Bandar, Arabs and non-Arabs will 
immediately tell you that he is a protege of the U.S. 
administration and the carrier of the purse of bribes, which he 
uses to buy the consciences of government departments and 
institutions that influence U.S. decisionmaking and harm the 
Arabs and their interests. It is well-known that Bandar was the 
link between his uncle's policy and Bush's move to create the 
atmosphere that paved the way for the 30-state aggression 
against our people. Whoever did not submit to the pressure of 
the U.S. administration received his share from the purse of the 
illicit funds that were set aside for such instigation and evil 
purposes and killing the honorable sons of the Arab nation. 
  Bandar was behind all the arms deals that Saudi Arabia had 
to 
make, although it had no practical or real defense need for 
them. He is an active commission agent who managed to clinch 
those very costly arms deals, which depleted the Saudi treasury 
for no reason other than showing loyalty to his overlords by 
paying off the bills of the aggression against Iraq. 
  Whoever follows Bandar's moves will discover that he is an 
obedient servant who has personally volunteered to call for the 
normalization of relations with the Zionist entity and to 
publicize the idea of ending the Arab boycott of Western states 
that deal with that racist regime at a time when scores of 
martyrs from the sons of our Palestinian people continue to 
sacrifice their pure blood in defense of their Palestinian soil. 
  In harmony with the conspiratorial role assumed by the 
regime 
of his uncle, who is known for his grudge against everything 
that represents goodness on the Arab land, Bandar is presently 
working hard on a new conspiratorial move. This one is against 
Yemeni unity by seeking justifications for the UN Security 
Council interference in Yemen's internal affairs in favor of the 
separatist clique led by the renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid and in 
continuation of Saudi Arabia's policy which, since the 
establishment of Yemeni unity, has been backing the separatists 
and providing them with funds and arms bought from Washington in 
fulfillment of a conspiratorial aim against the aspirations of 
the Yemeni people, who adhere to legitimacy and unity and its 
great achievements and to the democratic experiment that was 
strengthened under unity. 
  By his new cheap conspiratorial moves, Bandar only reveals 
his true mettle. For, he is not only following in the footsteps 
of his uncle and father, but also in the footsteps of those who 
run Washington's brothels. For he is known to be the man of its 
red nights, as was his "Uncle" Fahd before that when he was its 
captive and was being prepared for today's tasks. 
  Whoever is soaked in agentry cannot but drip vileness, 
meanness, and grudge and stand in the rank of the enemies of the 
nation. This "Bandar" is like that "Fahd."

  [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The UN secretary general's 
envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, arrived in Cairo this evening 
for a visit as part of his consultations and efforts to stop the 
fighting in Yemen. 
  President Husni Mubarak is scheduled to receive the UN envoy 
to discuss the latest developments of the Yemeni crisis and the 
tense situation there. 
  Brahimi will also meet Arab League Secretary General Dr. 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to follow up his consultations on the 
crisis. 
  In an arrival statement, Brahimi voiced his profound regret 
at the continuation of fighting in Yemen and at not 
consolidating Security Council Resolution 924 with a cease-fire 
between the rival parties. He confirmed that his efforts are 
continuing to achieve this goal. 
  He said that he submitted a proposal to the brothers in 
north 
and south Yemen yesterday and today that each side appoint its 
representatives to discuss setting up a mechanism to consolidate 
and supervise a cease-fire accord and that a meeting be held 
between these parties in Cairo if they agree. 
  He explained that the proposal was the result of various 
talks and counterproposals from the two sides during which they 
accepted the idea of setting up this mechanism and agreed that 
the meeting be held in one of the Arab capitals, including 
Cairo. The mechanism, he added, should begin with a joint 
military committee made up of representatives from Arab and 
other countries. 
  He noted that the two parties' stances are still far apart 
and that we are trying to establish an efficient groundwork to 
start direct talks. He said his mission took 15 days because 
the two sides engaged in proposals and counterproposals. He 
added: We must sit and explore the possibility of reconciling 
the two sides and reaching an agreement that might not be 
implemented. 
  The UN envoy expressed his hope that firing will stop 
immediately if the brothers in Yemen agree on this idea. He 
said that if an agreement is not reached or if the brothers in 
Yemen feel that such a meeting is not suitable at present, he 
will move on to New York after completing his consultations in 
Cairo. 
  Brahimi concluded his statement by saying that the brothers 
in south Yemen informed him of their consent to the proposal and 
that he is awaiting a response from the brothers in north Yemen, 
which he expects to receive tonight or tomorrow morning, 
Saturday.

  [Text] Cairo, 18 Jun (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak today received Lakhdar Brahimi, the special envoy of the 
UN secretary general who is investigating the Yemeni crisis. 
Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa attended the session. 
  Following the meeting, Minister Musa said that Egypt's 
position, as has been stated by President Mubarak, is that an 
immediate cease-fire should be observed in Yemen, because 
continued fighting is detrimental to that country and its unity. 
  Minister Musa said that a cease-fire would give dialogue a 
chance to begin and a solution to be found. The longer the 
fighting continues, the slimmer the chances of preserving 
Yemen's unity and interests. It is in the interest of all Arabs 
to see an end to the fighting in Yemen. This is a message that 
has been relayed to all the warring parties and expressed 
repeatedly by President Mubarak, Minister Musa stated. 
  For his part, Brahimi said that he was honored by his 
meeting 
with President Mubarak, noting that the meeting is part of the 
consultations he is holding with various Arab officials 
concerning the Yemeni crisis. He added that his visit to Egypt 
is the last stop on a tour that took him to a number of Gulf 
countries. 
  The UN envoy said he appreciates the time President Mubarak 
spent with him discussing the Yemeni crisis. Brahimi said that 
President Mubarak told him Egypt takes an interest in the crisis 
out of concern for regional stability. 
  Brahimi said that President Mubarak expressed a view shared 
by many Arabs and Yemenis, namely, that the fighting in Yemen 
should stop and that disputes should be worked out through 
dialogue rather than violent means. This is all I can say for 
now, Brahimi noted.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met 
today with a group of senior south Yemeni officials led by 
'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign minister of the self-declared 
government in Aden. 
  Brahimi said the meeting is part of the efforts being made 
to 
establish a cease-fire and set up the necessary mechanism for 
its verification. 
  Al-Asnaj said that Egypt's position is continuing to be that 
of a big brother concerned about the stability of the Arab 
region and eager to protect pan-Arab security. He noted that 
President Husni Mubarak has repeatedly tried to achieve peace 
and end the fighting in Yemen. 
  Al-Asnaj said: We are responding, but Sanaa is not, to the 
voice of reason and the virtuous call made by President Mubarak, 
underlined by Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan of the United Arab 
Emirates, and expressed by the Saudi Government. 
  He added: If a delegation from Sanaa comes here committed to 
the requirements of peace, Security Council Resolution 924, and 
the call of conscience that prohibits a Muslim from killing his 
Muslim brother, it will find a full response from us. 
  Al-Asnaj expressed hope that the Sanaa delegation will 
arrive 
and be able to make a decision that will be binding on officials 
in Sanaa. 
  He said that the Aden delegation will maintain its contacts 
with Brahimi. We are anxious to assist his mission and make it 
successful, he said. 
  He said the "Democratic Republic of Yemen" will remain in 
constant touch with the envoy of the UN secretary general to 
advise him on developments. He added: It was natural for us to 
come to Cairo to continue the talks to restore peace in Yemen 
and to observe Security Council Resolution 924, which calls on 
the concerned parties to stop firing immediately. We have 
expressed readiness to implement the resolution as soon as 
possible, but the government in Sanaa keeps evading the 
resolution and refrains from complying with it. 
  Al-Asnaj said Sanaa has to abide by the requirements of the 
Security Council resolution, respond to the world community's 
will, and end the ongoing aggression against defenseless Yemenis. 
  He noted that more than a month ago Sanaa said that it was a 
few kilometers away from Aden and that it would enter the city. 
He said that Sanaa will find in Aden strong resistance, 
valiance, and steadfastness because the entire south rejects 
invasion and occupation and views Sanaa troops as an occupation 
force that lacks any legitimate justification for its genocidal 
war. 
  He said that Aden's separation announcement reflected the 
people's right to self-determination. If Arab political 
recognition has not yet been announced, he said, it is because 
the fraternal countries are evaluating the situation. I do not 
think this will take long, he said. 
  Meanwhile, Lakhdar Brahimi said that if a delegation from 
Sanaa arrives in Cairo today, he will meet with it separately. 
A meeting between the northern and southern delegations, he 
said, will depend on the results of the talks with each side 
individually.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Anis Hasan Yahya, speaker of 
the provisional parliament recently established in Aden, today 
commended the efforts that Egypt, under President Husni 
Mubarak's leadership, is making to resolve the Yemeni crisis. 
He said that during his meeting with Egyptian officials he felt 
that they were anxious for a cease-fire in Yemen to safeguard 
the country's future. 
  He remarked that the war has created new, undeniable facts 
influencing Yemeni unity and tragic conditions that do not serve 
the country's interests. 
  The south Yemeni official added: Nevertheless, we are still 
taking the Yemeni people's united interests into account. We 
are advocating a different form of unity and will leave its 
discussion to the negotiators. 
  Yahya continued: At any rate, we are seeking to prevent 
further destruction in Yemen. 
  He affirmed that the problems that will surface after the 
war 
ends will be bigger than the war itself. Noting the adverse 
effects that the war has had on the south Yemenis' normally calm 
disposition, he said it is necessary to restore that disposition.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
today received a visiting south Yemen delegation led by Salim 
Salih Muhammad, member of the Yemeni Presidential Council and 
assistant secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party. 
Muhammad said that during the meeting they discussed 
implementation of Security Council Resolution 924 and Egypt's 
role, particularly before the crisis erupted and during the 
fighting, and all of President Mubarak's appeals and stances. 
  He noted that they also reviewed the efforts being made by 
Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, especially 
his meeting today with a south Yemen representative on the 
committee that will discuss a cease-fire. He said: We agreed 
on this proposal, which the representative of the UN secretary 
general has submitted and we are ready for this meeting. He 
noted that a delegation representing the other party is expected 
in Cairo from Sanaa. He said that the representative of the UN 
secretary general is exerting efforts to bring about a 
cease-fire, noting that this is the most urgent issue at 
present. He pointed out that if a cease-fire is reached, the 
discussion between the two parties will focus on forming a 
delegation to debate the other issues. He said that a meeting 
between the southern and northern delegations hinges on a 
cease-fire and Sanaa's compliance with Security Council 
Resolution 924. He said that Sanaa is trying to circumvent the 
issue and mark time. He said: We will turn to the Security 
Council to pass a new resolution deterring any party from 
violating Resolution 924, adding that right now this is what is 
required. Muhammad said that we will decide whether or not to 
go the Security Council in light of the contacts being made by 
UN Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi. 
  Muhammad said that fierce fighting continues and is focusing 
on encircling the Aden Governorate, and on finding loopholes to 
make the public feel that Aden is coming under an offensive. He 
noted that courageous resistance is confronting the attackers 
and things are beginning to change, particularly in the 
governorates of Shabwah and Lahij. He said that popular 
resistance has begun in these governorates. He noted that Aden 
has a cause adding: We are a recognized entity and are facing 
an invasion and occupation and our homes are being destroyed. 
He said: We have a right to request aid to defend our lives 
and future. He pointed out that the countries that supply south 
Yemen with arms are countries that support right and respect 
neighborliness, peace, and stability in the region. He said 
that these are Arab and friendly countries. He stressed that 
the war will yield other results and that negotiations will 
determine the Yemeni future, noting that the future will not be 
the same as it was before the war. He emphasized that unity 
cannot be imposed by force, noting that when we established 
unity it was agreed upon voluntarily. He said that regrettably 
this unity was destroyed from within by forces that do not want 
unity and who believe that unity is blood and violating the 
rights of others. He said that a unity that is not based on 
sound and principled foundations cannot survive because rockets 
and guns have destroyed this fragile unity.

  [Text] Cairo, 19 Jun (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa 
said after his meeting with the Yemeni delegation that Lakhdar 
Brahimi, special representative of the UN secretary general, is 
currently making contacts with the parties involved in the 
Yemeni dispute and that these contacts will continue all day. 
  He added that today's meeting was held to exchange views and 
listen to the Yemenis' viewpoint. He pointed out that the 
Egyptian contacts are independent of those being made by Brahimi 
and that they aim to spare Yemen the misfortunes of a continued 
war and help establish a cease-fire and begin a dialogue. 
  Musa said that a north Yemeni delegation will arrive in 
Cairo 
today. 
  Touching on his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton's 
envoy, he said that it concerned the envoy's special mission in 
Sudan. He added that views were exchanged on the situation 
there. 
  Musa explained that Egypt's stance is clear and that it 
emphasizes the need to preserve Sudan's territorial integrity, 
despite our political differences with that country. However, 
preserving Sudan's territorial integrity is an important matter 
that is part of mutual respect and safeguarding the rights of 
all the Sudanese people, he added.

'Ali Mansur Rashid, member of the standing committee of the 
General People's Congress, arrived in Cairo from Sanaa this 
afternoon. In his arrival statement, the Yemeni official said 
that this visit is within the framework of efforts to implement 
Security Council Resolution 924. He said: We are happy to 
visit Cairo, which is the haven of all Arabs. He noted that he 
is carrying a message from the Yemeni Government to Lakhdar 
Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to Yemen, who is 
currently in Cairo. Rashid pointed out that the situation is 
creating optimism and that they have come as representatives of 
two sides of the coalition parties in the Republic of Yemen, in 
addition to the Yemeni Socialist Party. [as received] 
  Rashid said that the delegations will discuss reviving and 
forming a military committee to monitor the cease-fire, noting 
that the delay in forming the committee is due to the south's 
intransigence. Concerning the possibility of requesting Arab 
forces to help monitor the cease-fire, he said that the 
situation has not yet reached that point and that it is still 
confined to the framework of the Yemeni state. He added that it 
has not ruled out the possibility of the parties' seeking the 
help of Arab forces.

  [Text] Cairo, June 20 (AFP)--A UN special envoy on Monday 
[20 June] announced the end of his mediation effort here between 
the warring Yemeni sides after failing to broker a ceasefire in 
their civil war. 
  Former Algerian foreign minister Lakhdar Brahimi told AFP 
"there will be no meetings today with the Yemeni parties" after 
a fruitless day of discussions on Sunday. 
  Brahimi said he would meet Arab League secretary general 
'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid before leaving on Tuesday for New York, 
when he will report back to UN Secretary General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali. 
  He had met separately with the northern and southern 
delegations on Sunday, but they refused to hold a joint session 
and there was no agreement on how to set up a ceasefire 
mechanism. 
  The southerners later announced that they were pulling out 
of 
the talks because Brahimi's meeting with their rivals had failed 
to produce results. 
  The southerners also charged that the northern team had no 
mandate to agree to a ceasefire. 
  Seventy-nine people had been killed and 248 wounded by late 
Sunday in a four-day barrage of the southern bastion of Aden by 
northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. 
  Brahimi was sent on a fact-finding mission in line with a UN 
Security Council resolution adopted on June 1 calling for an 
immediate ceasefire. 
  The north has insisted that a joint military commission 
should be set up to oversee a truce in the war which broke out 
on May 5. 
  But the south has accused Sanaa of playing for time in the 
hope of continuing its assault on Aden, capital of a breakaway 
state declared by southern leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 21.

  [Text] Cairo, 20 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak said 
that all the African leaders have praised Egypt's relations with 
all the countries of the world and the international 
organizations that helped to calm the situation in some areas 
and to begin a new era in relations through dialogue and 
understanding. 
  In statements to the weekly newspaper MAYU today, President 
Mubarak added that these African leaders with whom he met in 
Tunis during the recent African summit also praised the decision 
to establish a mechanism to examine conflicts by peaceful means 
and the efforts to reduce African debts. 
  He said that Egypt's status among the African states has 
greatly been enhanced, noting that all the African states with 
whom he met in Tunis thanked Egypt for the large role and 
sincere effort it undertook to solve the problems of the 
continent during Egypt's chairmanship of the OAU in the past 
year. 
  President Mubarak added that all the African leaders have 
felt the genuineness of the efforts Egypt has made to resolve 
the continent's political and economic problems, particularly 
border problems, existing tensions, and internal problems in 
some states. 
  Regarding the Nile water and the danger threatening it as a 
result of the corpses dumped in it from the Rwandan war, 
President Mubarak reassured the people of Egypt that there is no 
danger at all, noting that the Victoria Lake water represents no 
more than 10 percent of the water that reaches Egypt. He said 
that the water is purified and cleaned by natural and 
geographical factors in the course of its long journey. He 
affirmed that Egypt is keen to safeguard its people's health, 
and that this issue is being carefully monitored by the 
pertinent departments.

<F P=106> [By Fathi al-Barqawi in Tunis] </F>
  [Text] The Fatah Central Committee was scheduled to hold a 
meeting yesterday to discuss recent developments, especially the 
situation in the autonomous areas in the Gaza Strip and the West 
Bank after the Palestinians took charge. PLO quarters here, 
however, were surprised by the convening of a meeting for the 
Revolutionary Council. The Palestinian leaders who are still in 
the Tunisian capital, the headquarters of the Palestinian 
leadership, took part in the meeting. 
  AKHIR KHABAR has learned from sources in Fatah that 
President 
Yasir 'Arafat told the attendees, only 30 members, that he had 
met yesterday afternoon with a delegation from the World Bank. 
He said the delegation offered $10 million out of $42 million 
that were originally agreed upon at a meeting in Paris last 
week. 'Arafat said he turned down the offer. 
  'Arafat also asked the members of the National Authority 
Council to return to the homeland as soon as possible, stressing 
the need for the leaders to be among the masses. He praised 
Council member Furayh Abu-Middayn, saying Abu-Middayn was quick 
and positive in settling some important issues. 'Arafat 
stressed that the Fatah movement should remain united so that it 
can correct anything that could obstruct the activity of the 
National Authority agencies. He, however, emphasized the need 
to practice democracy as much as possible under pluralism. 
  Talking about other factions within the PLO, the Palestinian 
president said some of these factions have started to abandon 
their hard-line approach that opposes the peace process and are 
asking to participate in the National Authority Council. 
  According to some quarters within the largest PLO faction, 
'Arafat had asked that the committees formed by the 
Revolutionary Council in its recent session begin working. 
Three committees will indeed begin working as of today, 
Saturday, in his presence personally. These committees are 
concerned with standardizing organizational principles, choosing 
qualified personnel, and popular committees.

  [Text] Tunis, June 18 (AFP) -- PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat 
has asked the United States and Europe for more funds to help 
set up the new Palestinian authority in the autonomous Jericho 
area and Gaza Strip. 
  While delaying his trip to Jericho because of his 
organization's financial difficulties, 'Arafat also asked for 
speeding up the transfer of 42 million dollars promised in 
emergency aid, the PLO news agency WAFA said Saturday [18 June]. 
  'Arafat made the requests in separate talks Friday and 
Saturday with ambassadors John McCarthy of the United States and 
Jean-Noel de Bouillane de Lacoste of France as well as with 
envoys from Greece, Germany and Belgium. 
  The international community has already promised 2.5 billion 
dollars to help launch Palestinian autonomy, including more than 
600 million dollars for this year, but the PLO has complained 
that donors are hesitant. 
  A Palestinian official said 'Arafat is angry at the slowness 
in disbursing the 42 million dollars which international donors 
promised on June 11 in Paris to cover a deficit in the operating 
budget of the new authority. 
  Self-rule was launched on May 4. 
  A representative of the World Bank involved in the transfer 
of the sum is in Tunis, but only "for consultation" and "not for 
handing over the money," the official said. 
  A new meeting of donor nations is planned for July 10-11 in 
Paris, where the PLO leader is expected on July 6 to receive a 
prize from UNESCO. 
  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said he told 
'Arafat 
here last Saturday that the PLO leader should be patient while 
ways are found to make sure the money is not wasted.

Ibrahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to Yemen. 
  During the meeting, brother Salim Salih Muhammad was 
briefed on the results of the contacts conducted by the envoy of 
the UN secretary general, and highly praised the efforts exerted 
by Ibrahimi for implementing the Security Council's Resolution 
No. 924. 
  Brother Salim Salih Muhammad stressed the importance of 
ceasing the hostilities immediately and stopping the random 
bombardment of the civilian residential quarters and areas in 
the capital, Aden as a result of which hundreds of innocent 
citizens, including children, women and old people, have fallen 
victim, and halting the continued destruction process of public 
services by the ruling military regime in Sanaa. 
  Brother Salim Salih Muhammad highlighted the current 
suffering of the inhabitants of the city of Aden as a result of 
the siege and the random shelling, and pointed out the heroic 
steadfastness in confronting this destructive war in defense of 
honor and safeguarding the lives of the innocent. He stressed 
the need to condemn and stop this aggression by all people, 
Arab, international organizations, and other bodies to prevent 
the dangerous repercussions which increase day by day.

  [Text] Kabul, June 19 (AFP) -- Afghan President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani will not resign at the end of June but is prepared to 
transfer his authority to a legitimate national assembly, an 
official spokesman declared Sunday [19 June]. 
  "The president is waiting for an authorised assembly to be 
established, to which he will deliver his authority," said 
presidential spokesman Abdul Aziz Morad. 
  Morad rejected demands of rival faction leader Prime 
Minister 
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that Rabbani must resign at the end of June, 
saying the president's legitimacy rested on the Kabul grand 
national assembly held in December 1992. 
  The establishment of a transitional government to settle the 
two-year-long Afghan factional power struggle, which has been 
proposed by a peace commission based in the western provincial 
capital of Herat, had Rabbani's support, Morad said. 
  However, he said there was no contradiction between the 
power 
of the president and the power of the proposed Supreme Council 
to be set up in Herat. 
  "The president's authority is totally separate from the 
authority of the Supreme Council," stated Morad. 
  The proposed Supreme Council would set up an interim 
government which, within nine months, would pave the way for 
convocation of a grand assembly, itself responsible for drafting 
a constitution and deciding on the future leadership of 
Afghanistan. 
  It is to this grand assembly that Rabbani is most likely to 
transfer his authority, should it ever be convened, but as 
Hekmatyar has threatened more military action if Rabbani does 
not resign by June 28 the chances of the peace process working 
appear slim. 
  Neither Hekmatyar nor Rabbani have announced their intention 
of attending the Herat conference yet. The prime minister wants 
a "preliminary" meeting in Kabul first while the president would 
go "if the necessity existed." 
  Kakojan Niazi, a spokesman for the Herat-based peace 
commission, said it was hoped a meeting between Rabbani and 
Hekmatyar representatives would take place in Kabul, in order to 
thrash out details of the proposed Herat peace conference. 
  In the capital Sunday -- a public holiday in observance of 
the Muslim religious anniversary of Ashura -- there was little 
military activity, although locals reported continued fighting 
between the Shi'ite Harakat-e Eslami faction and Hekmatyar's 
Hezb-e Eslami in south Kabul.

  [Excerpt] In his reply to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that Israel has significantly 
eased the closure on the territories but will not lift it 
totally. 'Arafat was given data showing that 45,000 permits for 
work in Israel have already been given to residents of the 
territories and that the entry of women and of youths up to the 
age of 15 is no longer restricted. 
  'Arafat had called on Rabin to ease the plight of the 
residents of the territories, lift the closure and the 
restrictions on work in Israel, open the roadblocks at the 
entrances to Jerusalem, and immediately transfer to the 
Palestinian Authority funds from taxes and customs Israel has 
imposed on the Palestinians. This amount comes to approximately 
6 million shekels, and Israel is holding on to the funds until 
accounts are settled with the Palestinian Authority. 
  Rabin informed 'Arafat that Israel will meet its commitments 
but will not be able to go beyond that. Israel will also not 
lift the roadblocks at the entrances to Jerusalem. [passage

  [Text] Tehran, June 18 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Ali Akbar 
Velayati said Saturday that an Iranian delegation would visit 
Iraq in two weeks to prepare for his forthcoming visit, the 
first by a senior Iranian official since 1991. 
  The delegation had been due in Baghdad on June 11, but the 
trip was postponed at the last minute for unspecified reasons. 
  Velayati told AFP that the delay had been mutually agreed by 
upon the two countries. 
  But a senior Iranian official told AFP the visit had been 
postponed "at the request of Iraqi authorities." 
  The minister said he still expected to visit Baghdad in 
July, 
in the first visit to Iraq by a top Iranian official since the 
1991 Gulf war. 
  The visit is aimed at continuing discussions to normalise 
ties five years after the end of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. 
Talks resumed last October after they were broken in the wake 
of the Gulf war. 
  Tehran and Baghdad are sharply divided over a number of 
issues, mainly the fate of thousands of prisoners of war from 
both countries.

majesty the king's summit with U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
Washington on Wednesday [22 June] will focus on the Middle East 
process and its future. The king begins talks with U.S. 
officials in Washington tomorrow ahead of his summit with the 
American President. 
  Murid Hammad in Washington asked Jordan's Ambassador Dr. 
Fayiz al-Tarawinah about the king's talks: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-Tarawinah] It is a continuation of the 
bilateral considerations, and also of course to exchange views 
and consultations on the regional developments, and in 
particular the peace process, and basically the recent 
developments in the Jordanian track, and also the 
Palestinian-Israeli track, and the accord that was signed 
therein. And of course we have, as you know, announced the 
formation of the joint political and economic bilateral 
commission. And hopefully, that there will be a first meeting 
of this commission, will be launched this week. 
  [Hammad] What is the nature of the commission? What kind of 
topics and issues would it tackle? 
  [Al-Tarawinah] It's purely bilateral, and political and 
economic considerations. And it is purely a bilateral 
commission. And the objective basically is to enhance the 
bilateral relations that are improved tremendously as compared 
to what three years ago. Of course, there will be always a 
linkage with the developments in our region, but the American 
participation in the peace process as a cosponsor in the 
bilaterals, the multilaterals...they are full participants in 
the trilateral economic committee that we had, but this is a 
purely bilateral commission that takes into consideration the 
political and economic matters with the objective of improving 
and enhancing these relations. [end recording]

Yesterday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr. 'Ali 
Akbar Nateq-Nuri, and the deputies from the cities of Tarqobeh 
and Chenaran, Molayer, Mian-e Doab, Samirom, and Urmia gave 
speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which 
he condemned the shameful signing of the Gaza-Jericho Treaty 
between the PLO and Israel and offered congratulations on the 
triumph of the blacks in South Africa. Then the Majles went into 
consultation, and we direct the attention of our esteemed

<H5>  Ahmad Moradi, Deputy From Tarqobeh And Chenaran </H5>
  The government organizations and the Economic Council raise 
the prices of goods and services at every opportunity on the 
pretext of economic adjustment. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Moradi, deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran. He 
commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari, 
Teacher Week, and Workers Day. He discussed the disgraceful 
performance of the United Nations and the international 
organizations with regard to the slaughter of the Muslim people 
of Gorazdeh by the bloodthirsty Serbs. He said: The world's 
oppressed and tormented nations must realize that the only road 
to liberation is the return to self and reliance on God and 
unity. 
  The speaker discussed the importance of the agricultural 
sector and the nation's steadfastness towards crises and 
economic and political embargoes. He said: Unfortunately certain 
decisions, one made this past year by the Economic Council to 
increase the prices of fertilizer and pesticides, have weakened 
this sector, and if it does not receive serious attention we 
will witness the loss of the efforts made by the Ministry of 
Agriculture and the national investment. We will even need to 
import wheat and major agricultural crops. 
  Moradi discussed the severe cold in the orchards in the 
province of Khorasan, and the serious damage to the agricultural 
crops. He said: The government must provide long-term credits 
for the current years and it must also insure the orchards in 
the years to come. 
  The deputy from Tarqobeh and Chenaran also discussed the 
one-sided and monopolistic performance of most sugar cube 
factories last year and this year. He said: This has not only 
irreparably damaged the nation's sugar cube industries, it has 
caused an unreasonable rise in the price of sugar cubes and 
sugar in the country and has hurt the general public. It is 
necessary that the government deal with this matter seriously. 
  The speaker discussed the one-sided and unjust way in which 
the sugar cube factories have dealt with farmers. Then he 
discussed the shortage of cash in the nation's factories. He 
said: Unfortunately the Ministry of Economic and Financial 
Affairs and the Central Bank have regularly obstructed exports 
and the import of raw materials, and the result has been factory 
closures, unemployment, reduced production, and, ultimately, it 
has unleashed inflation, which has caused emotional pain for the 
exalted leader and the oppressed nation. 
  Continuing, Moradi added: Controlling prices and preventing 
inflation is not something that can be solved with speeches, 
memos, and guidelines. Only production and sound competition can 
give the consumer the right to choose. 
  Continuing, he said: The government organizations and the 
Economic Council raise the prices of goods and services at every 
opportunity on the pretext of economic adjustment and helping 
the vulnerable classes, ignoring the fact that there has been no 
benefit to these people other than damage, harm, and inflation, 
even though there may be long-term benefits. 
  Continuing, he criticized some unnecessary classes in the 
universities. Elsewhere in his speech he thanked the president 
of the republic, the delegation sent and the office of the 
governor-general of Khorasan, who made efforts to solve the 
problems in his electoral district. He said: Unfortunately, 
although a year has gone by since the written order was issued 
by the Ministry of Petroleum to provide gas service to the 
district of Tarqobeh via Mashhad, nothing has yet been done. 
  The speaker thanked Engineer Gharazi, minister of post, for 
ordering that telephones be assigned to the public for 
installment payments in the municipality of Chenaran. In 
conclusion he issued memos concerning his electoral district. 
<H5>  'Abdollah Nowruzi, Deputy From Molayer </H5>
  The next speaker was Nowruzi, deputy from Molayer. During 
his 
speech he discussed the issue of privatization. He said: If 
privatization is to take place, it must occur with Iranian 
thinking, with the nation's makeup and culture and in our 
various circumstances. It must not be something conceived at the 
College of Economic and Financial Affairs or by a council from 
the World Bank, some of whom are American. 
  He added: Unfortunately there is a foundation there called 
the Rockefeller and Ford Foundation giving special seminars on 
privatization, providing guidance and giving direction to our 
activities, yet we ourselves should be doing the privatization. 
  The speaker added: Their third seminar is to take place on 
the 20th and the 21st. Their leader is Mr. David Ellerman [as 
published], an American, and according to many of them, a CIA 
agent who is officially supported by it. They have utterly 
destroyed Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, and El Salvador. 
  Continuing, the speaker said: Although some of what is in 
the 
Second Five-Year Plan is good, in some places it has impure 
strains, and if careful attention is not given to those, it will 
face great dangers. 
  In conclusion, the speaker discussed the fact that in the 
Plan and Budget Organization there is a group of valuable and 
perceptive experts. He said: There are also some who think in 
terms of sectors and sometimes in terms of their own positions 
and their home cities. This situation definitely exists in the 
management of the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of 
Defense Affairs, the Administrative Affairs Organization and the 
Plan and Budget Organization, and we must design the Second 
Five-Year Plan based on the realities and needs of society. 
<H5>  Jalal Rasuli, Deputy From Mian-e Doab </H5>
  The Economic Council must be controlled with understanding 
and expertise. 
  The next speaker was Rasuli, deputy from Mian-e Doab. During 
his speech he commemorated the memory of Martyr Motahari. He 
said: Unfortunately our Ministry of Education has weak 
management and this has meant that there is now a bipolar 
educational system in our society. Those who have more money and 
resources attend the nonprofit schools. Taking private classes, 
they enjoy more instruction, training, and education. 
  The deprived classes in society, however, have lower quality 
education and have been beset by dropouts. 
  He added: People are now even selling their carpets and 
refrigerators so they can pay the costs at the nonprofit schools 
and send their own to centers where they will receive good 
education and training. 
  He discussed the Majles project to control prices. He said: 
The Economic Council must be controlled with care, attention, 
understanding, and expertise so that the result will be 
limitations on services and also so that it will not cause long 
lines and a black market for goods marketed through government 
investments. 
  Continuing, Rasuli then cited the failure to invest in the 
conversion industries as a factor in the reduced capability of 
fruitful farms. He said: West Azarbaijan, especially my 
electoral precinct, has green pastures and potential resources 
for animal husbandry and agriculture, but due to the lack of 
conversion industries and the inability of the people to invest 
in these areas, it is faced with a serious problem. This is 
especially true in the area of beet growing, which could free 
the nation from the need to import beets. Unfortunately, 
however, a worn-out factory built in that area about 50 years 
ago is absolutely unable to answer the production needs of the 
people. 
  He added: The only crop in the area whose cultivation is 
mechanized is beets, but because the factory does not have the 
necessary equipment and capacity, they have problems marketing 
their crop. The people grow crops to meet the factory's 
capacity, but unfortunately the people's crops rot in their 
hands, while we import sugar from abroad. 
  He explained: The issue of privatization has meant that now 
the Plan and Budget Organization and the Central Bank have 
stopped this project to build beet factories in these areas. 
They emphasize that investment should be made by the private 
sector, although it is confirmed that in deprived areas such as 
Mian-e Doab the private sector does not have the ability to 
build factories. 
  Continuing, the speaker discussed the rising waters of Lake 
Urmia. He said: This has swallowed up thousands of hectares of 
land and not that much attention has been given to it. 
  It would be appropriate for the government to compensate the 
losses of farmers, especially the several rural areas that have 
been engulfed in water. 
<H5>  Mahmud 'Attarzadeh, Deputy From Samirom </H5>
  Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the government 
organizations will not only create inflation, it will also 
encourage corruption. 
  The next speaker was 'Attarzadeh, deputy from Samirom. He 
commemorated the memory and the name of Martyr Motahari, the 
sacrifices made by the nation's teachers. He commemorated World 
Worker Day and said: Today more than at any other time, world 
imperialism is seeking to create and put pressure on the 
community of Islamic nations and especially the revolution 
nation of Iran. 
  He discussed the fact that the policy of economic adjustment 
designed for growth and development must not only be balanced 
and proportional, but it must also have real and executive 
coordination that is appropriate for the social structure and 
for the cultural, social, and economic requirements of the time. 
He said: In the policy of economic adjustment a general strategy 
is pursued to eliminate subsidies, adjust manpower, reduce 
currency in circulation, deregulate trade, unify the foreign 
exchange rate and strengthen the private sector. In view of the 
social and economic consequences of this policy for society, 
especially the oppressed and vulnerable classes, attention must 
be given to the following issues: 
  1 - The government and the executive officials must take the 
initiative in enduring the pressures resulting from 
implementation of the policy of economic adjustment, and they 
must endure some of the pressures imposed on the people by 
cutting expenses. 
  2 - In implementing the policy of economic adjustment 
planning must be done and solutions must be found for the 
problem of bringing the cost of living and the incomes of the 
people into line with each other, yet presently there is no 
correspondence between incomes and costs. 
  3 - Careful and logical policies must be made regarding 
exports and imports, especially to alleviate the obstacles and 
restraining factors at the various stages of executive activity 
in export affairs. 
  4 - Real and more serious attention must be given to 
productive economic activities with reliance on domestic 
resources and priority to agriculture. 
  5 - Meeting import needs appropriate for a revolution 
society 
and designing suitable procedures and models for imports. 
  6 - The consumer models are not in conformity with the 
sacred 
goals of the revolution, and they severely exacerbate 
formalities and ceremony. The government and the officials must 
therefore take the initiative themselves and learn to economize 
and make do. 
  7 - Financially, the self-sufficiency program of the 
government organizations not only creates inflation and imposes 
pressures of life on the people, it also encourages corruption 
and undermines the public spirit of participation and 
forbearance. 
  In conclusion, he issued memos to the Ministry of 
Agriculture 
concerning concern for marketing and exporting Samirom's apples, 
to the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade concerning 
allocating more credits and banking facilities for the Regional 
Tribal Housing Project and attention to the small rural 
industries, to the Ministry of Energy concerning expediting dam 
construction in the region and trapping the region's water, to 
the Ministry of Roads and Transportation concerning expediting 
road reconstruction from Samirom to Shahr-e Reza, and to the 
Ministry of Education and Training about the creation of 
semicentralized rural schools and their services due to the 
scattered disposition of the rural areas. 
<H5>  Beytollah Ja'fari, Deputy From Urmia </H5>
  The workers are the most valuable and profitable group in 
our 
society, and the nation's production is in their powerful hands. 
  Beytollah Ja'fari, deputy from Urmia, was the final 
preagenda 
speaker. He said: The workers are the most valuable and 
profitable group in our society, and the nation's productive 
life is in their powerful hands. I hope that one day we will be 
able to cap the oil wells and build the nation's economy on 
nonoil resources. 
  He read a selection of poetry concerning the position of the 
teacher and discussed the problems and difficulties in his 
electoral district. He said: Lake Urmia, with an area of 4,868 
square kilometers, is considered the largest permanent 
water-collecting basin in Western Asia. It is 1,067 meters above 
sea level, and recently, with the rise in the water level, it 
has created numerous problems for those residing on its shores. 
The Council of Ministers must attend to this problem with 
special diligence, because about 7,000 hectares [ha] of useful 
pasture and 3,000 ha of farm land have been completely 
destroyed. Because the lake's water is salt water, in 15 more 
years these lands will be useless, and the government must find 
a basic solution for the farmers who have suffered. 
  At the present time, 30 rural areas are threatened by the 
water. It is highly likely that they will have to evacuate and 
move to another place. 
  He added: The facilities at Bandar-e Golmankhaneh are in 
danger. Damage is being caused, whose preliminary figure is 11 
billion rials [R]. The solution is not for the officials to sit 
waiting and then after all this damage has been done undertake 
to compensate for the damage. The essential solution is to put 
large reservoir dams on the rivers that flow into Lake Urmia 
from West Azarbaijan. The precipitation provided by the 
Creator's mercy is wasted due to the lack of planning and the 
failure to deal with infrastructure in our region, and every 
year this damages the strategic agriculture sector. Despite the 
cries from the region's Majles deputies, attention is not given 
to these matters as it can and should be given. Nothing would be 
better than to invest in these provinces that have the ability 
to become Iran's great agricultural centers, along with the 
desert reclamation projects and the construction of multilane 
freeways in the middle of the country. 
  I ask the nation's media, especially the Voice and Vision 
organization, to portray in a clear and comprehensive way the 
suffering and disarray of the rural people who have been hurt by 
flooding and the rising salt waters. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the Islamic Guidance and Art 
Commission concerning the Motion To Inquire About Article 1 of 
the Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government Institutions and 
Companies From Printing and Publishing Nonessential 
Publications, enacted 7/29/1365 [21 October 1986], of which 
Article 1 was approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: "The Law Prohibiting Ministries and Government 
Institutions and Companies From Printing and Publishing 
Nonessential Publications also includes the nation's 
municipalities." 
  It is worth mentioning that the publication of any kind of 
book, newspaper, magazine, similar publication, any kind of 
promotional paper or sheet, pamphlet, tract, poster or other 
item by government organizations was prohibited by the 
aforementioned law. 
  One of the important points in this motion to inquire was 
that the Guidance Commission agreed to exempt the municipalities 
from this law, but the Majles rejected that. 
  Concerning this motion, Mr. Movahedi-Saveji said: If the 
municipalities come and make huge expenditures on cards for 
invitations, congratulations, condolences in the Majles and 
other things, this is clearly against the interest of the 
people. The people are very unhappy about this money being spent 
on these things. 
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Housing 
and Urban Construction Commission concerning the bill on the 
Amended Bilateral Transportation and Shipping Protocol for 
Moving Goods by Road, between the Government of the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and the Government of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan, which was approved by the deputies. 
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the Plan and 
Budget Commission concerning the rejection of the proposed 
amendment to Paragraph A, Note 47 of the 1364 [21 March 1985-20 
March 1986] National Budget Law, the principle of which was 
approved by the deputies. 
  Article 1: The official in charge of the provincial Islamic 
propaganda organization is added to the members of the province 
planning committee mentioned in Note 47 of the 1364 National 
Budget Law. 
  One of the reasons the commission rejected the 
aforementioned 
motion is the "executive point of view" of the work of the 
province planning committees, rather than cultural work. 
  The commission expert also said: If specific cultural 
problems arise in the planning committee, the provinciale 
general manager of guidance, who is on the committee, will solve 
them. Supporters of the motion argued that with the official in 
charge of the province propaganda organization on the committee, 
it would have a stronger cultural dimension. Just as there are 
many managers of economic organizations on the province planning 
committee, in addition to the general manager of guidance, the 
committee should also have as a cultural official the official 
in charge of the province propaganda organization 
  The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the 
Accounting Court Commission concerning the Proposed Law on 
Procedures for Spending Current and Development Credits for the 
Year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] at Payam-e Nur 
University (returned from the Guardian Council). 
  According to Article 1, Payam-e Nur University is 
authorized, 
due to the special procedures in the educational system, to 
spend a maximum of 65 percent of its current expense and 
allocated credits and also 25 percent of its development credits 
based on the Law on Procedures for Carrying out Financial and 
Trade Affairs at Universities and Institutions of Higher 
Learning and Research, without observing the government's other 
general regulations. 
  The final item on the agenda was the report from the second 
consultation of the Agricultural Commission concerning the 
Motion To Form the Supreme Agriculture and Rural Development 
Council, continued consideration of which was deferred to the 
next session. 
<H5>  Measures Taken by Majles Commissions </H5>
<H5>  Ministry of Intelligence Employment Bill </H5>
  According to Article 21 of the aforementioned bill, to 
procure and train the technical and specialist cadres it needs, 
the Ministry of Intelligence may establish colleges or 
institutions of higher learning in fields not taught in the 
nation's universities, based on lawful regulations and 
requirements. This bill has been approved in the Joint Councils 
and National Domestic Affairs and Administrative and Employment 
Affairs Commission. 
<H5>  Bill Indexing Nongovernment Public Bodies and Institutions </H5>
  Based on the above bill, the municipalities and affiliated 
units, as long as 50 percent of their shares and capital belongs 
to the municipalities, the Foundation for the Oppressed, the Red 
Cross, the Imam's Aid Committee, the Martyr Foundation, the 
Housing Foundation, the Iran National Olympic Committee, the 15 
Khordad [5 June] Foundation, the Islamic Propaganda Organization 
and the Social Security Organization are included in the note 
for Article 5 of the Public Accounting Law enacted in 1366 [21 
March 1987-20 March 1988]. 
<H5>  Motion To Determine Recording Fees at Official Documents </H5>
Offices 
  This motion states that in order to obtain the funds 
necessary to implement Articles 10, 11, 57, and 68 of the 
administrative laws for official documents. Every month these 
offices are required to pay 10 percent of the recording fees 
collected into the account for insurance, retirement, 
disability, and welfare, and treatment affairs for office heads 
and assistant office heads in the official documents offices and 
their dependents. 
  This motion was approved in the Judicial Affairs Commission, 
which was acting as the main commission. 
<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  New Foreign Exchange Policy </H5>
  Engineer Khamushi, deputy from Tehran, discussed the new 
foreign exchange policies. He said: If the new foreign exchange 
policies are properly implemented as announced, it will be 
constructive. That is, the banking system must act on requests 
to open credit accounts from the factories out of foreign 
exchange obtained from exports. In this case the foreign 
exchange market will cool down. The procedure recently announced 
is the same one implemented several months ago by the banks, 
which produced results controlling demand on the foreign 
exchange market. 
<H5>  Supreme Agricultural Council </H5>
  One of the motions presented at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the motion to form the Supreme Agricultural Council. 
In this regard Engineer Jalali, chief of the Agriculture 
Commission, told our correspondent: To reach its goals, the 
agricultural sector needs extraordinary support to solve its 
problems, and it needs the necessary coordination between the 
relevant organizations. Exports of agricultural crops was one of 
the successful sectors under the First Five-Year Plan, and more 
than 120 percent of the designated goal was achieved. 
  Continuing, he said: With the formation of the Supreme 
Agricultural Council, supervision of planning in this sector, 
setting and designing guaranteed prices for agricultural crops, 
creating coordination between organizations, supervision of the 
procurement and training of manpower, policymaking to create 
conversion industries, support for the export of products from 
this sector, and supervision of the timely procurement of 
credits and banking facilities for the agricultural sector will 
be properly carried out. 
  He discussed the members of the Supreme Agricultural 
Council. 
He said: The president of the republic will serve as chief of 
the council and the minister of agriculture, the minister of the 
reconstruction crusade, the minister of energyr, the minister of 
economic and financial affairs, the minister of the interior, 
the chief of the Plan and Budget Organization, and the chief of 
the Environmental Protection Organization will serve as the main 
members. Two members of the Majles Agriculture Commission will 
attend meetings as observers. 
<H5>  Membership of Officials of the Islamic Propaganda </H5>
Organization in Province Planning Committees 
  Following the approval of membership of officials from the 
Islamic Propaganda Organization in the province planning 
committees, Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammadi Eraqi told 
our correspondent: To distribute development credits and 
engender coordination between the organizations, province 
planning committees will be formed, with the participation of 17 
executive officials and under the supervision of the 
governor-general. Despite the necessities that are felt with 
regard to cultural issues, so far the propaganda organization 
has not had members on these committees, and with Majles 
approval this will be done. 
  He added: Despite the fact that the propaganda organization 
does not have development credits approved by the Majles, so far 
it has carried out 250 development projects, some of which are 
half-complete. This organization's projects include the 
construction of 50 Koranic societies in the deprived areas. With 
the membership of representatives from this organization on the 
province planning committees, henceforth it will be possible to 
use local credits to complete the propaganda organization's 
half-complete projects.

CSO 

  [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The 
Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Mr. 'Ali Akbar 
Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of Bandar-e 
Mahshahr, Dorud and Azna, Miyaneh, and Rudbar spoke as preagenda 
speakers. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a short speech in 
which he offered condolences to all Shiites on the martyrdom of 
Mohammad Taqi (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its 
agenda, and we direct the attention of our respected readers to 
the detailed proceedings. 
<H5>  Kemal Daneshyar, Deputy From Bandar-e Mahshahr </H5>
  The roots of inflation and high prices include the failure 
to 
control the prices of goods and the failure to deal decisively 
with violators. 
  The first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles 
session was Daneshyar, deputy from Bandar-e Mahshahr. During his 
speech he said: The most important economic problem is inflation 
and high prices. Most of that was unavoidable and inevitable, 
but unfortunately, contradictory and extremist economic policies 
and extremism and excesses have had their effects in this 
matter. An example worth mentioning is the previous government's 
severe and extreme approach to the imposition of price controls, 
compared to the policy of deregulation and releasing prices to 
float in the current government. 
  Continuing, he said: Supervision, monitoring, price setting, 
and dealing with violators, people selling at high prices, and 
hoarders must be done as soon as possible in a decisive and 
calculated way. 
  The speaker then discussed uprooting inflation and high 
prices. He said: The failure to control the prices of goods; the 
failure to deal decisively with violators; people selling at 
high prices and godless hoarders; ostentation; useless 
expenditures by officials; working too little; promoting the 
culture of too much consumption; weak management on the part of 
some executive officials, especially the failure to supervise 
quality control of the goods produced by domestic industries; 
the enormous expenses from the imposed war; military 
reconstruction and preparation in view of the malicious, Satanic 
qualities of the enemies of Islam; the rapid population increase 
to double the size of the last decade, along with the rapid 
increase in the consumer market; the failure to increase the 
gross national [product] to match the population increase and 
demand; the destructive effects of the wrong policies of the 
wretched monarchy's one-product economy; continued economic, 
military, and political plots by the enemy, especially the 
reduction in the price of oil and the economic embargo against 
Iran; are among the factors and roots of inflation and high 
prices. In this same regard Daneshyar said: It is a very 
difficult task to determine the percentages of the above 
factors, inflation and high prices. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Mahshahr said: In view of the 
destructive and corrupting effects of using Western television 
programming and using satellite antennas, since in practice no 
technical or practical procedure has yet been recognized to 
intercept it, solutions proposed, including prohibiting the use 
of satellite antennas or strengthening and promoting the spirit 
of faith among the individuals in society to keep them from 
watching these destructive programs, definitely will not serve 
as the final solution. 
  In this same regard, the speaker then added: The Foreign 
Ministry has proposed via the United Nations and with the help 
of friendly countries, as a means of protecting the innocence 
and morality of human beings to prevent the destructive and 
corrupting effects of television programs broadcast from Western 
transmitters, to provide and implement restrictions, 
prohibitions and penalties against those who broadcast this type 
of vulgar programming. 
  Daneshyar also called upon the Shiite and Sunni clergy and 
the clergy of other religions of the book, especially the 
Christian clergy, to act jointly to confront this destructive 
cultural invasion. 
  The deputy from Mahshahr then discussed the consolidation of 
the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade and the Ministry of 
Agriculture. He said: In view of the fact that this proposal has 
weakened the performance of these two ministries, I propose, 
since most of the deputies are opposed to the motion to 
consolidate the two ministries, that this matter be taken off 
the agendas of the commissions and the Majles as soon as 
possible and that these debates be put to an end. 
  Continuing, the speaker discussed the problems in his 
electoral district. He said: In view of the reduced 
precipitation and the drought in the region, I ask the officials 
and especially the minister of agriculture and the chief of the 
Agriculture Bank to help the farmers and to allocate banking 
resources. Likewise, the important roads in the municipality of 
Mahshahr, including the freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Ahvaz, the 
freeway from Bandar-e Emam to Mahshahr, and the road from 
Omidiyeh to Ahvaz are causing problems because of their poor 
quality, and I ask the minister of roads and transportation to 
deal with the matter. 
  In conclusion, the deputy from Mahshahr asked Mr. Karbasian, 
chief of the Social Security Organization, to expedite 
construction of the Omidiyeh Hospital, which was planned under 
the First Five-Year Plan and is proceeding slowly. 
<H5>  Jahanshah Sadiq, Deputy From Dorud And Azna </H5>
  In designing the Second Five-Year Plan the Majles must keep 
society's low-income classes in mind. 
  The next speaker was Sadiq, deputy from Dorud and Azna. He 
offered condolences on the occasion of the martyrdom anniversary 
of His Holiness Emam Javad (peace be upon him) and discussed the 
Second Five-Year Plan. He said: In this regard, friend and foe 
are watching the Majles and are waiting for the results of the 
Majles studies. 
  Fortunately, in this regard the Majles has lighting its way 
the guidance from the exalted leader as an important element of 
support. Naturally, it must keep the affairs of the oppressed 
and low-income classes of society in mind at every stage. In 
addition to that it must strive in every way possible to reduce 
dependence on oil revenues in the Second Five-Year Plan, which 
has become an implement in the hands of the enemies of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran as a destructive political item. This 
cannot be done without increasing nonoil exports, and 
comprehensive government and Majles support must be given to 
domestic products, especially the production of crops and 
products that can definitely be produced in the country but that 
are imported with excessive foreign exchange expenditures. 
  He added: A fundamental question today is, are we going to 
repeat the same mistake that was made under the First Five-Year 
Plan, which is giving excessive support to industry while 
remaining indifferent to investment in the agricultural sector? 
  There is no doubt that investment to a reasonable extent in 
the industrial sector is both necessary and inevitable, but 
which industry? 
  He added: Isn't it true that nonoil exports from the 
agricultural sector were 123 percent of the target set in the 
First Five-Year Plan, and yet exports in the other industries, 
especially in the industrial sector, did not even reach 50 
percent of expectations? If, despite all the unkindness towards 
the agricultural sector, this sector was able to achieve all the 
goals set for it in the First Five-Year Plan, it is because 
today we have the message from the agricultural sector that 
investment in this sector is the most reasonable step to which 
we must give attention. 
  Continuing his remarks, Sadiq said: Unlike industry, 
agriculture is instantly obedient to the nation's executive 
system. The production line can be changed any instant. It can 
be planned in accordance with the nation's needs, while to 
change the production line in industrial factories requires 
changing many of the systems prevailing in the factory and the 
expenditure of huge sums. 
  To give attention to the agricultural sector is to apply the 
guidance from the late Imam about making efforts to achieve the 
nation's self-sufficiency and obeying the guidance from the 
leader of the revolution about giving attention to agriculture, 
and nothing other than this is expected from the Majles. 
  He then discussed the decisions made concerning this 
province 
by the president of the republic and the exalted leader during 
their recent trip. He said: The people of Lorestan are joyous 
about the attention from the exalted leader and the president of 
the republic in the framework of the success implementing the 
projects and programs to save the province from deprivation. 
However, making the successes, which have been achieved, 
requires effort, persistence, and expeditious measures by the 
respected ministers and the relevant executive organizations, 
and the people continue to watch them expectantly. We have said 
repeatedly that the petrochemical and refinery complexes were to 
have been built in Lorestan, but unfortunately the justification 
is not clear for moving this project to Arak, when it could have 
solved many of the problems of the province of Lorestan. 
  The deputy from Dorud and Azna asked officials to provide 
gas 
service to Lorestan, and he discussed the efforts by the 
minister of the interior to elevate Azna to a municipality and 
the president of the republic's agreement. He said: The lands 
given to staff employees and educators have remained in their 
hands due to the preparation project. They have sold much of 
their furniture and resources to pay the fees to prepare the 
land, yet they are still unable to do the preparation work. 
<H5>  Seyyed Hoseyn Hashemi, Deputy From Miyaneh </H5>
  The Second Five-Year Plan must clearly specify the goals of 
privatization. 
  The third preagenda speaker was Hashemi, deputy from 
Miyaneh. 
In his speech he discussed the aggression against Muslims in the 
world. He said: The imperialist world has made a serious 
decision in different ways to weaken the Muslim world, and to 
prevent in any way possible the expansion of the ideas of 
revolutionary Islam and the Islam of Muhammad (peace be upon 
him). On the other hand, despite all the imperialistic effort, 
every day we see more harmony in the Islamic nation and the 
expansion of this great Islamic thinking everywhere in the world. 
  He condemned the PLO treaty with Israel and discussed the 
Second Five-Year Plan. He said: Although we had good successes 
implementing the First Five-Year Plan in the agricultural, 
industrial and mining sectors, these successes reduced our need 
for imports in many areas. A more desirable process must be 
implemented in studying these experiences and careful expert 
work in the Second Five-Year Plan. 
  He added: An example is the policies in the system for 
alleviating deprivation in the nation's deprived and 
underdeveloped areas, which is being done to implement social 
justice. It is appropriate to give special attention to this in 
the Second Five-Year Plan, taking inspiration from the views of 
the exalted leader. We can guide capital into these areas by 
making appropriate policies such as special tax and insurance 
exemptions and special allocations for service lines, water 
prices, consumer electrical power, and providing banking 
facilities on easier terms and at lower fees. 
  Concerning the matter of privatization, he noted: The 
transfer of government units in the current way, mostly by 
organizations, bodies, banks and other entities, each of which 
is a part of the nation's public system, will not bring us to 
our goal in this regard. Therefore, the Second Five-Year Plan 
must clearly specify the goal of privatization. Is it to 
eliminate private sector currency in circulation, or to start up 
new units and transfer existing government units? He discussed 
the use of existing capacities, completing half-complete units 
and rebuilding government and private units and building them 
anew. He said: These units must have a specific policy 
throughout the Second Five-Year Plan, one of which must be 
regarding exports as the main key to solving the production 
problem, and that needs a special policy to support exports in 
the Second Five-Year Plan. Especially with the unification of 
the foreign exchange rate, a good process has been set in 
motion, but it is not enough. We have had little success in the 
area of manufactured industrial goods such as capital and 
intermediate goods. 
  Continuing, the deputy from Miyaneh discussed the 
consolidation of the industrial ministries. He said: I do not 
consider the current effort to consolidate as being appropriate. 
I recommend that in the first phase the Ministry of Industries 
and the Ministry of Heavy Industries be consolidated and that 
the Ministry of Mines and Metals operate independently for a 
time so it can find its place in the nation's economy, 
especially in the area of nonoil exports. 
<H5>  Jamshid Qanbarian, Deputy From Miyaneh </H5>
  It is hoped that with the activation of the Azerbaijan Steel 
Complex Project the problem of employment in the area will be 
solved. 
  Another preagenda speaker was Qanbarian, deputy from 
Miyaneh. 
He expressed thanks for the appointment of Mr. Hamedi as Friday 
Imam of Miyaneh and offered congratulations on the arrival of 
Teacher Day. He said: One of the region's main problems is 
absolute unemployment and intense emigration. Unfortunately 
every year several villages are emptied of their residents 
because of this same emigration, in such a way that this region 
now has negative population growth. 
  He added: The only solution is to create employment in the 
area, and it is hoped that with the activation of the Azarbaijan 
Steel Complex project this social problem will be solved in the 
area. In the same regard I give the utmost thanks to the exalted 
leader for his comprehensive support for solving the executive 
problems in this project. 
  He thanked the Ministry of Petroleum for its success 
implementing the project to deliver gas service to Miyaneh, he 
thanked the minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning 
the unstinting activities of the ministry's officials in the 
region to meet telephone communications needs and the president 
of the republic's Deprived Regions Office for granting 
recognition as deprived regions to the villages in the warm 
southern region. 
  He then said: Due to the lack of an active police presence 
throughout the roads and freeways, the drivers of 
tractor-trailer rigs and heavy trucks have destroyed driving 
security without police monitoring. Every day tens of innocent 
people lose their lives on these roads, and the minister of the 
interior is expected to pay special attention to this matter. 
<H5>  Faramarz Golshani, Deputy From Rudbar </H5>
  What makes the earthquake victims happy is having officials 
in their midst. 
  The final preagenda speaker was Golshani, deputy from 
Rudbar. 
He discussed the passage of four years since the Rudbar 
earthquake and the approaching anniversary for this disaster. He 
said: The only thing that makes the people happy is having 
national officials in their midst. Last year the speaker of the 
Majles and deputies and officials came, and this year we are 
also to have the honor of their presence. They will see the 
great reconstruction that has begun at the government's capable 
hands and to help alleviate the shortages. 
  The speaker discussed the president of the republic's 
impending trip to Rudbar. Continuing, he discussed the shortages 
in this earthquake-stricken municipality. 
  1. There are still 65 schools that were destroyed by the 
earthquake and have not yet been rebuilt, and the students from 
these schools are studying in Suleh and in inappropriate places. 
  2. Sixtyy-six of the municipality's rural areas lack 
electrical power, 96 rural areas lack sanitary drinking water, 
and 200 kilometers of rural roads are also in need of asphalt. 
  3. Fifty percent of the credits to build 84 mosques, 31 of 
which are under construction, is needed. 
  4. The financial situation of the people is such that there 
is no possibility of meeting the expenses of municipal 
government through normal revenues. Therefore, urban development 
needs reinforcement of the tax base. 
  5. Continuing, he added: Inadequate allocations of loans and 
materials for home construction and other problems have caused 
most housing units for earthquake victims to be abandoned after 
70 to 80 percent completion. Therefore, loans of at least 200 
million rials for each urban and rural family would complete 
half-complete homes. 
  6. The people of the municipality are from the low-income 
classes, and in view of the extensive losses the earthquake has 
brought to them, they are unable to repay pre-earthquake housing 
and business loans. 
  Mr. Golshani asked for loan forgiveness and also for the 
extension of repayment periods on postearthquake loans until the 
end of the year 1373 [20 March 1975]. 
  Continuing, the speaker added: The 100-bed Rudbar hospital 
was destroyed by the earthquake, and the current hospital has 
been created in Suleh. It does not have the appropriate quality 
and is in need of credit procurement. The cities of Rudbar, 
Rostamabad, Manjil, and Lushan lack a suitable drinking water 
network, and the cities within the municipality's boundaries do 
not have a sewage system. Credits need to be obtained to fight 
pestilence, irrigate date trees and plant rice in the area and 
to rebuild the cities. 
  The speaker continued: Before the earthquake about 1 million 
loans existed in the municipality, and this number has decreased 
to one-quarter of that figure. Livestock keepers are in need of 
serious support. Despite the fact that the minister of petroleum 
has broken ground for the project, construction work on 
providing gas service to the cities of Rudbar, Rostamabad and 
Tut-e Kabon has yet to begin. 
  At the end of his speech he said: I ask that when the 
president of the republic comes to the area these projects be 
supported and receive financial assistance. 
<H5>  Legislation </H5>
  The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles 
session was the report from the first consultation of the 
Agriculture Commission on the motion to create the Supreme 
Agriculture and Rural Development Council, the general form of 
which was not approved and was rejected. 
  It is worth mentioning that in the aforementioned motion, 
the 
duties of the Supreme Agriculture Council were described as 
follows: "Dealing with executive problems in the programs 
pertaining to the agricultural sector, supervision of the 
performance of programs in the agricultural sector, supervision 
of the procurement and organization of statistics and 
information having to do with the agricultural sector's needs 
and supervision of their precise implementation, policy making 
to create conversion industries and installations to store 
agricultural crops, supervision of the timely procurement of 
credits and facilities for the agricultural sector, and other 
things." 
  One of the reasons used by those opposing this proposal is 
that there is no reason to put the various sectors in the hands 
of a council. What good have the existing councils done for the 
people? Therefore, the councils do not solve any problems, they 
create problems. 
  Likewise, the supporters claim that it is necessary to have 
a 
council led by the president of the republic to support 
agriculture, in order to solve these problems that exist. 
  The second item on the agenda was the report from the 
Supreme 
Education Council concerning the Bill To Amend Article 2 of the 
Law on Procedures for Procuring Faculty Needed at the Nation's 
Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning, enacted in 
1365 [21 March 1986-20 March 1987], the general form of which 
was put to a vote and approved. 
  Article 1 of the bill states: "The phrase `and animal 
husbandry' is added after the phrase `medical group fields' in 
the text of Article 2 of the Law on Procedures for Procuring 
Faculty Needed at the Nation's Universities and Institutions of 
Higher Learning, enacted 3/1/1365 [22 May 1986]." 
  It is also worth mentioning that professors in the animal 
husbandry fields may, as in the medical group fields, make use 
of the facilities and benefits in this law, and this will have a 
striking effect in raising the level of quality in this field. 
  The next item on the agenda was the report from the Commerce 
Commission concerning the Bill To Amend Note 1, Article 5, of 
the Law Amending the Guild System Law Enacted 2/31/1368 [21 May 
1989]. 
  The amendment to this bill says: "Within one year of the 
date 
this law's enforcement becomes obligatory, all the companies 
subject to the Guild System Law are required to obtain business 
licenses from the relevant union. Newly established companies 
are required within one year of their registration to obtain a 
business from the relevant union in order to begin operations." 
  The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the First 
Consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission 
Concerning the Motion To Suspend the Period of Obligatory 
Service for Graduates from the Judicial Affairs Colleges in the 
Nation's Public Prosecutor's Offices and Judicial Courts, 
continued consideration of which was postponed to the next 
session. 
  The aforementioned motion states: "Under this law, graduates 
from the judicial affairs colleges affiliated with the Ministry 
of Justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran who have not 
performed their service as soldiers, upon the recommendation of 
the judicial power and with the agreement of the General Armed 
Forces Staff, provided they commit to at least five years of 
service in the judicial power, are exempt from service under the 
flag in peacetime after the completion of the commitment." 
<H5>  Arrival Announced of Question From a Number of Deputies </H5>
Concerning the Reason for Increasing Telephone Rates 
  Arrival was announced of the question from a number of 
deputies, including Sharifi, deputy from Arak; Tavakoli, deputy 
from Khomeyn; Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel and Fars; Majidi, 
deputy from Fasa; and Noruzi, deputy from Molayer; to the 
minister of post, telegraph and telephone concerning the reason 
for the collection from telephone service subscribers of 
telephone tariffs in excess of the amount approved by the Majles.

<H5>  Majles Notes </H5>
<H5>  Presentation of the Question to the Minister of Mines and </H5>
Metals Concerning the Performance of the Mobarakeh Steel Complex 
  Next week the question from the deputy from Hamadan to the 
minister of mines and metals concerning the Mobarakeh Steel 
Complex and its affiliated complexes will be on the open Majles 
agenda. 
  In this regard Mr. Habibian told our parliamentary 
correspondent: I submitted three questions for the Majles to the 
minister of mines and metals. The first question asks about the 
level of steel production and to what extent it conforms to the 
goals in the First Five-Year Plan. In this regard there are 
indications that performance was not in accordance with the 
First Five-Year Plan. In the commission the respected minister 
of mines and metals was also asked to provide information about 
this sector, but so far, about a month later, the necessary 
information has not been made available to us. 
  The second question is about the procedure for selling 
steel, 
and the question is, have the domestic markets been saturated, 
that steel is now being exported? 
  The third question, which is more important and worries us 
more, is the question of steel shipments. In recent months these 
shipments have gone to parts of the world such as China to be 
sold and have then returned to the country after a time, and in 
this regard large sums have been paid for demurrage (reparations 
paid for losses caused by shipping delays). 
<H5>  Majles Oversight of Nonessential Foreign Trips </H5>
  Concerning Majles oversight of nonessential foreign trips, 
which will be done based on Note 13 of the 1373 [21 March 
1994-20 March 1995] National Budget Law, Mr. Beytollah Ja'fari, 
deputy from Urmia, told our correspondent: The motivation for 
Majles oversight is that we want to be able to study and make 
decisions concerning the number of people going and whether or 
not the trip will have positive effects for the country in terms 
of its essential purpose. 
  According to the general evaluation that was made, the 
number 
of delegations sent abroad was in excess of the number necessary 
and in most cases ancillary tasks were undertaken beyond the 
main goals of the trip, and this has caused the imposition of 
millions of dollars in nonessential expenditures on the nation's 
budget.
