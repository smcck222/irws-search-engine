  [Text] Competent security organs have revealed that 
elements from the "Lebanese Forces" [LF] were behind an 
unspecified number of crimes that took place in Lebanon, the 
most important being the explosion in Tripoli's vegetable market 
in 1988. This explosion came after the failure to sabotage the 
gathering held in the city to mark the first anniversary of the 
assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid Karami and the 
explosion of vehicles in west Beirut. 
  Judge Joseph Mi'mari, assistant government representative to 
the military court, charged 12 LF members with the following 
crimes: carrying out terrorist actions; detonating booby trapped 
vehicles in various parts of Lebanon; contacting the Israeli 
enemy and undergoing military training in its territories; and 
killing many people. The charges were made in accordance with 
Articles 5 and 6 of the 11/1/1948 Law, Articles 549/201, 278, 
and 463 of the Penal Code, and 72 weapons. [sentence as 
published] Most of these charges are punishable by the death 
sentence. 
  Judge Mi'mari referred the following arrested defendants to 
the military investigation judge: Pierre Rizq, alias Akram; 
Samir Abu- Yunus, George Lawun, Tony Khuri, Hasan Fawwaz, Michel 
Istifan, Hadi Mas'ad, George Makhluf, Hadi Sham'un, 'Azar 
Mukhawwal, Ghayth Zaydan, and Joseph 'Antar. 
  AL-SAFIR has learned that "Akram" was charged with ordering 
the liquidation of detained supporters of Minister Ilyas 
Hubayqah and throwing of their bodies on the main roads between 
Nahr Ibrahim, Juniyah, and Beirut. "Akram", an official in the 
LF security service, put those tasked with liquidating six of 
Hubayqah's supporters during the 27 September 1987 operation 
under observation to ensure that they would not hesitate in 
carrying out the order and hence prove their loyalty to LF 
leader Samir Ja'ja'. 
  Michel Istifan was charged with planting a device in Tripoli 
on the first anniversary of the assassination of Rashid Karami. 
When the device did not explode, he changed the detonator "so 
as not to waste it," as he said, and planted the device in the 
city's vegetable market. Many traders and pedestrians were 
killed in the explosion. 
  The others were charged with "liquidating" Lore al-Hashim 
and 
her husband when they tried to blackmail her after detonating a 
vehicle in the western sector of Beirut during the war.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Nun: "Senior Syrian Official Tells AL-HAYAH: </F>
`We See No Solution With Israel Under Any Kind of Pressure'"] 
  [Text] Damascus -- A senior Syrian official expects U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to return to the region in 
August. He emphasized that Syria "did not ask Christopher not 
to come to the region" and that it was Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhaq Rabin who did that. 
  The same official told AL-HAYAH that "there is not a single 
Syrian who would accept, would be able, or would be authorized 
to forfeit even a single grain of the homeland's soil. 
President Hafiz al-Asad said that, and it applies to all times, 
conditions, and circumstances." 
  He reaffirmed that "there is a big gap between the positions 
of Syria and Israel" and that last time Secretary Christopher 
came to Damascus he did not bring "a satisfactory Israeli reply" 
to Syria. He emphasized that "no power on earth can force Syria 
to accept what it does not want.... We take a long view and we 
known that a conflict like the Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be 
settled justly and comprehensively under the pressure of any 
time element or any other element." 
  The same source said that "the right thing in the peace 
process on the Syrian track would be for Israel to accept the 
essence of the peace process, namely land for peace -- the 
occupied territory in return for Arab peace for Israel. When 
Christopher last came to Damascus it was clear that Israel 
wanted to discuss details and secondary issues before beginning 
to lay down the foundations of peace on the basis of the 
principles agreed between the United States and the parties to 
the peace process. If the occupied territory -- all the 
territory occupied during the 1967 aggression -- is not 
returned, there can be no real and true initiation of the 
establishment of peace in the region or on the Syrian-Israeli 
track." 
  He said that "Israel did not give the United States its 
acceptance of the land-for-peace principle but played around 
with phrases and words to mislead world public opinion. Rabin 
spoke of withdrawal from the Golan and he also spoke 
demonstratively saying that he would opt for the dismantling of 
the settlements in the Golan if he had to choose between peace 
with Syria or the settlements in the Golan. It was clear that 
Rabin was working more for misinformation than for real peace in 
the region." 
  In reply to a question, he said that what Syria "wanted and 
still wants is a just and comprehensive peace in the region 
based and founded on the principles of international legitimacy 
and the UN resolutions. There is nothing in these principles 
and resolutions that gives the condemned aggressor Israel the 
right to keep even one single inch of the Arab territories 
occupied in the 1967 aggression. That is why Syria told 
Christopher and world public opinion that there was a big gap 
between the positions of Syria and Israel. Syria really and 
seriously wants to proceed toward the establishment of a just 
and comprehensive peace but Israel, through verbal and 
diplomatic games, wants to fulfill its aims and ambitions in the 
region, something it could not fulfill through its numerous wars 
and aggressions." 
  The senior Syrian official added that, in Syria's view, "the 
letter A of the alphabet which must be uttered before the rest 
of the letters of the peace alphabet can be pronounced is a 
declaration of Israel's agreement to fully withdraw from all the 
territories it occupied during the 1967 aggression, in 
implementation of the UN resolutions and the peace process 
principles. When Israel pledges full withdrawal, and in so 
doing opens the way for the fulfillment of the aim of the peace 
process, we can then move on to the question of security 
arrangements and then to the rest of the relevant issues to 
establish a full peace between Syria and Israel." 
  He said that President al-Asad had declared at his joint 
press conference with President Bill Clinton in Geneva that 
Syria "is prepared to sign an agreement with Israel if it 
accepts the equation of full peace in return for full 
withdrawal. Syria cannot put the cart before the horse and 
engage in discussions about peace and details of peace relations 
before the cornerstone is laid down for ending the state of war 
which has existed between Syria and Israel since 1948. The 
horse must come before the cart, and that horse is full 
withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967." 
  In reply to a question, he pointed out that "Syria has 
cooperated with the United States in the peace process since the 
letter sent by President al-Asad to former U.S. President Geroge 
Bush accepting the U.S. initiative which launched the peace 
process on the basis agreed by the United States and the rest of 
the parties concerned with the target set for that process, 
namely just and comprehensive peace. Damascus had repeatedly 
received former Secretary of State James Baker and also received 
Secretary Christopher, and never said that it would reject a 
U.S. secretary of state's visit or that it was severing contacts 
with Washington. What Syria wants is a peace process based on 
the principles agreed upon for that process leading also to the 
target set for that process." 
  In reply to another question, he said that "to this moment 
and to this day, Washington has not said that it has abandoned 
the principles agreed upon for the peace process nor the set 
target which is just and comprehensive peace. U.S. President 
Clinton has reaffirmed his adherence to the peace process and 
the basis and objective agreed upon. There has been nothing 
from the American side to indicate that it wishes to abandon 
that position. When Washington announced that it would play the 
role of full partner, that meant that it felt the process, which 
Israel was delaying, required more efforts in order to proceed 
and continue."

  [Text] AL-MAJD has learned that the Syrian leadership has 
offered to host the leadership of Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] in Damascus and said it can stay for as long as it 
wants, just like other Damascus-based Palestinian opposition 
factions. 
  Informed sources said this Syrian offer was welcomed and 
appreciated by Hamas. The offer was made during meetings by 
Hamas leaders last week with a number of Syrian leaders, 
including Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam, Foreign Minister 
Faruq al-Shar', and Sami 'Atari, member of the Ba'th Party 
National Command. 
  The sources said the Hamas delegation -- which comprised Dr. 
Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the Hamas Political Bureau; Ibrahim 
Ghawshah, Muhammad Nazzal, and Abu-Muhammad Mustafa -- preferred 
to wait before it makes a decision until it studies the offer in 
the light of the future political developments, particularly the 
development in the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations.

  [Text] In "An Opinion" column, TISHRIN says: The massacre 
at Hebron's Holy Ibrahimi Mosque was not the act of an 
individual. The Israeli Government and the Jewish settlement 
policy are fully responsible for this ugly crime, as well as all 
previous and subsequent crimes, against the Arabs. This is 
because the Israeli Government allows settlers to carry, and 
trains them on the use of arms under security pretexts. It also 
hoards them in communities inside the occupied Arab territories 
at the expense of the Arabs and their dignity, and fills them 
with hatred and rancor against the Arabs so that the settlers 
will support the Israeli Army in terrorizing the Palestinians 
and force them to leave their homes and lands. 
  TISHRIN adds: The continued occupation of the Arab 
territories and the continued presence of settlers in these 
territories will keep the situation in the region explosive. 
The crimes of settlers and the Israeli Army are the product of 
a single policy that is based on murder, terrorism, and 
expansion.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: It took the Israeli state commission of 
enquiry that examined the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre four full 
months to reach a forgone conclusion. The commission found the 
Israeli military, Government, and settlers not guilty, and held 
Baruch Goldstein solely responsible for the carnage. If the not 
guilty verdict had been so cut and dried, why did it take the 
commission so long to reach its conclusion about an outrage in 
which Goldstein was aided and abetted by the Israeli settlers 
and military? We could even have guessed the exact wording in 
which the verdict was going to be phrased. All the crimes and 
massacres committed by the Israelis and their Haganah, Stern, 
Aragon, and Kach gangs over more than half a century have either 
been whitewashed or blamed on deranged individuals. We need not 
recount the massacres in which Israel's history abounds. 
Whoever wants to look at Israel's history of terror, on which 
Israel was founded, need only refer to UN and Security Council 
files. The exoneration of the Israeli Government and military 
from responsibility for the Hebron Massacre, all the evidence to 
the contrary notwithstanding, is significant in more ways than 
one, and carries untold risks to the Palestinian Arab people and 
the peace process. The commission's findings, in effect, give 
the go-ahead to the settlers and the Israeli military to 
perpetrate further atrocities against the Palestinian people. 
The findings make of the settlements veritable time bombs and a 
permanent threat looming over the Palestinian people and the 
entire peace process. 
  Israeli Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has said that he cannot 
rule out a recurrence of the Hebron massacre. In effect, Baraq 
is encouraging settlers to commit further massacres against the 
Palestinians and is encouraging the Israeli military to look the 
other way or even participate in future outrages, just at it did 
in the Ibrahimi Mosque case as shown in evidence ignored by the 
Rabin government's report. 
  The Arabs cannot forget that Israel owes its existence to a 
string of massacres committed in Palestinian towns and villages 
-- from Dayr Yasin, Qibya, Lod, and Ramlah, to Qafr Qasim and 
Sabra and Shatila, to name but a few. Systematic terror has 
been state policy for successive Israeli Governments. Attacks 
against south Lebanon and acts of piracy on land, at sea, and in 
the air, and the abduction of individuals are prime examples. 
More ominously, what Israel is doing, under the international 
community's very nose, is not being met with the firmness and 
resoluteness it deserves. Israel is thus encouraged to persist 
in its aggression and terror in broad daylight and to imperil 
the peace process and to keep the region as a flash point 
threatening world peace and security. 
  The findings of the Israeli state commission of enquiry 
cannot absolve the Rabin government or the Israeli military of 
culpability in the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Nor can they cut 
any ice with the international community. Even assuming a 
segment of the international community is convinced that no 
blame should be attached to the Rabin government or the Israeli 
Army in the Ibrahimi Mosque episode, it cannot but judge as 
terrorism Israel's acts of aggression and abductions in south 
Lebanon and its conduct in the Golan Heights and in the occupied 
Arab territories and in detention centers. 
  This makes the international community all the more 
responsible for the safety of the population in the occupied 
Arab territories and the success of the peace process.

  [Text] Under the headline "An Urgent Mission To Save the 
Yemeni People," TISHRIN calls for halting the Yemeni war between 
the two parts of Yemen. TISHRIN stresses that this great 
bloodshed in Yemen, accompanied by destruction, bombardment, 
successes, defeats, and sieges, is pushing Yemen back to the 
Middle Ages, leaving behind grudges and backwardness. It is a 
mistake to believe Yemen's problems can be resolved by military 
means, pressure, and coercion. These can never lead to the 
prosperity, advancement, and democracy sought by the people of 
Yemen. 
  TISHRIN urges everyone to heed the voice of reason and 
wisdom 
and to be aware of the dangers of a persisting war, of its 
regional and international repercussions, and its adverse 
effects on the Yemenis themselves. The paper says it is 
necessary to transcend trivialities and personal, selfish 
tendencies, for Yemen's safety and existence are being 
challenged and are being put to the test. Therefore, everyone 
must realize that only dialogue can thwart and encircle the 
dangers and save Yemen and its institutions from destruction, 
internationalization, and genocide. 
  Concluding, TISHRIN says: From that premise, the mission of 
safeguarding Yemen unity is a historic necessity in the interest 
of the Yemeni people and their aspirations and objectives.

<F P=106> [Article by Avil Kumar Sharma: "Pakistan and the F-16 </F>
Bombers"] 
  [Text] The recent US proposal to hand over the second lot 
of 38 F-16 bombers to Pakistan without Islamabad first putting a 
lid on her nuclear programs and accepting the international 
security measures adds a new chapter in U.S. policy on the 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty [NPT] in South Asia. Whereas 
the U.S. attitude towards India is manifested by a variety of 
pressures and proposed sanctions that are consistent, her 
attitude towards Pakistan is fickle and often full of 
contradictions. The latest U.S. enticement of Pakistan, whose 
nuclear weapons program was chiefly nurtured by the feigned 
indifference and inactivity of the U.S., is its move to suppress 
and cover its despair in NPT matters by pressuring her protege. 
  During the cold-war, the U.S. indifference to Pakistan's 
nuclear arms program was only a mask. This enabled arms to be 
supplied continually to Afghan rebels in their uprising against 
the USSR- supported government of Najibollah. This was also the 
reason why despite the controversial information received 
through CIA sources, the U.S. President continued to issue 
"clean-chits" on Pakistan's nuclear program. 
  But the end of the cold-war signified a decline in the 
importance of Pakistan for the U.S. The result being that the 
White House at the end of October 1990, expressed its inability 
to issue such chits. Consequently, all the military aid given 
to Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment provisions were 
stopped. But contrary to even U.S. expectations, Pakistan 
managed to meet all its defense needs in the last four years. 
  It appears that Pakistan is not likely to be trapped by this 
U.S. enticement as she has her own problems. Even if Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto wants to, she cannot accept the U.S. 
proposal as Pakistan's nuclear program is in the hands of the 
military, with opposition leader Nawaz Sharif giving it a 
political color. Prime Minister Bhutto perhaps would not like 
to shatter the dreams of her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who 
launched the nuclear program under any external pressure by 
suspending it. 
  According to a report published in Washington, the U.S. 
would 
like to entice India together with Pakistan, to nab the former 
in her policy trap. If India agrees to sign the nuclear NPT and 
accepts the measures for international security proposed by the 
U.S., the latter might extend her the following benefits. 
  (1) First, the U.S. could take the initiative by resuming to 
supply fuel for the Tarapur Power Plant. It may be recalled 
that after India's peaceful nuclear testing in Pokharan in 1974, 
the U.S stopped supplying fuel for the plant in 1980-81 under 
its policy of coercion and regulation of nuclear 
nonproliferation. But, due to the (?determined) policy of 
Indira Gandhi and her followers, and France as its alternative 
supplier of Uranium U-235, India not only successfully ran the 
plant, it also did not compromise on its nuclear policy. 
  (2) Also, an assurance could be given to soft peddle Super 
301 measures. The U.S. has all along been threatening India 
together with Japan and Brazil with imposing economic and trade 
sanctions for their prohibitive business behavior under Super 
301 rules. Any U.S. decision in this regard would prove 
extremely important for India in her current weakened economy 
because one-fifth of its total exports are consumed in the U.S. 
  (3) With the liberalization of U.S. rules on computer 
imports, it may become possible for India to start exporting her 
latest computers. After a recent liberalization, the U.S. 
Department of Commerce allowed India to export computers of the 
level of 500 MTOPAS. If the U.S. wants, it can raise this level 
to 1000 MTOPAS, the limit it prescribes for other countries. 
India's present quota is only 125 MTOPAS. 
  (4) Another concession is providing complete help to 
Hindustan Aeronautics in manufacturing light bombers. The 
cessation of aid from the U.S. firm, Marin Marietta, to Indian 
scientists in design-development for advanced flight-control 
systems could prove to be a great headache. But any ban on 
General Electric engines by the U.S. could ground the whole 
program till the Kaveri engine, which is still being produced by 
the Gas Turbine Research Organization, is ready. 
  How far would these U.S. enticements to India like the F-16 
bombers to Pakistan, serve U.S. economic interests? The basic 
idea of resuming the supply of uranium and helping in the 
manufacture of light bombers is to make India dependent on the 
U.S. On the other hand, the supplies of the most modern 
computers is also guided by demand. Computer technology is a 
monopoly of the U.S. and Japan. The aim of the relaxation of the 
U.S.-Japan computer monopoly is to remove hurdles in its 
competition with Japan, which as a result the U.S. electronics 
industry has so far suffered losses of $30 billion. India's 
increased use of computers and the huge size of its market could 
help compensate the U.S. favorably for this loss. 
  Like India and Pakistan, another victim of the 
economic-interest-spurred by U.S. NPT policy is North Korea. By 
blowing out of proportion North Korea's nuclear capability, the 
U.S., on one hand, has been able to make its active role in 
nuclear nonproliferation felt. On the other hand, by creating a 
atmosphere of fear in South Korea, it has activated a market for 
its weapons new and old. The recent supply of Patriot missiles 
bear testimony to this assertion. Unhappy with the U.S. 
decision to resume supplying F-16 bombers to Pakistan, the 
Republican Senator from South Dakota and the author of the 
Pressler Law, Gary Pressler, has perhaps rightly commented: 
"Instead of adopting a responsible policy on NPT in South Asia, 
the Clinton Administration appears to be conducting only the 
sale of the military arms and junk brought out from the Pentagon 
garage." Whether it is to restore the F-16 jets to Pakistan at 
the cost of Pakistan's nuclear program or frightening the South 
Koreans by magnifying the nuclear capability of North Korea and 
thus ensuring the sale of her missiles to South Korea, the only 
aim of U.S. policy is to use the NPT to enhance regional 
imbalances, and as a cover to fan the demand for traditional 
arms that has been dying after the end of the cold war. To the 
U.S. this appears to be the only way to save its arms industry, 
which has now fallen on bad times. To achieve this, the U.S. 
can go to the extent of using the nuclear nonproliferation as a 
weapon and it into cold storage in case it fails. 
  The Clinton Administration has not made a final decision on 
Pakistan's F-16 jets. However, the views of the Assistant State 
Secretary Robin Raphel in the context of the ineffectiveness of 
the Pressler Amendment for achieving the NPT aims indicate that 
the U.S. might restore its supply without any conditions, and 
this should cause no surprise. 
  If the U.S. is really worried about the increasing number of 
countries with nuclear capability, why does it not forgo its 
business ruses and attempt to set a treaty that is acceptable to 
all? Such a treaty should not only provide guarantees for 
nonnuclear countries by prohibiting the use of force by nuclear 
states, it should also provide for an early and systematic 
destruction of their nuclear arsenals.

  [Text] With the visit of Mr Fedorov, managing director of 
Irkutsk Aircraft production association, which manufactures the 
frontline Russian combat aircraft Soyuz-30, the most advanced 
Russian military aircraft are being offered at favourable terms. 
  A deal on MiGs, including sale of 30 MiG-29 fighters and 
upgrading MiG-21s by fitting it with an air-to-air missile, has 
been finalised by the two sides. It only needs to be formalised 
after settling the details of delivery schedules and payments. 
  Now Mr Fedorov has offered to sell and manufacture 20 
Soyuz-30 fighter aircraft under licence by HAL [Hindustan 
Aeronautics Limtited]. This dovetailing will be facilitated by 
the ongoing collaboration between HAL and Irkutsk aircraft for 
production of MiG-27 aircraft in India. 
  However, the production of MiG-27 has to be phased out 
within 
two years. This will render the production capacity at HAL idle. 
It has been suggested by Mr Fedorov that the vacuum at HAL can 
be filled by producing Soyuz-30 under licence. 
  The Soyuz offer creates a new situation in which Indian air 
defence planners can exercise a choice by going in for the most 
effective fighter aircraft in line with Indian needs, while 
obtaining the transfer. 
  In obtaining the Russian set-up, the MiG and Soyuz design 
bureaus function independently and each has the authority to 
enter into sales or collaboration agreement with their foreign 
counter-parts. Thus, while the MiG design bureau has been 
finalising arrangement for MiGs with India's defence ministry, 
the Soyuz has now entered the scene with an offer through 
Irkutsk Aircraft producers, handling the manufacture and sales 
of Soyuz fighter planes. 
  Defence experts hold the Soyuz-30 to be an effective fighter 
aircraft capable of taking on the American F-18 fighters. While 
MiG-29 is lighter, and therefore more manoeuvrable, Soyuz-30 has 
a longer range. In terms of the Indian environment, the MiG-29's 
range covers Pakistani targets right up to NWEP, while Soyuz-30 
could go much further. 
  Experts also feel that MiG-29 and Soyuz-30 could form an 
effective combination. 
  The Soyuz-30, however, is far more expensive in its 
maintenance costs against the MiG-29, it is stated. The pricing 
of the plane can be attractive, in view of the keenness of the 
Irkutsk to have a big deal with Indian for Soyuz 30. Attractive 
commercial credit is also learnt to have been offered, 
presumably to settle the deal during tne Prime Minister, Mr 
Narasimha Rao's visit to Moscow.

  [Text] New Delhi -- A conscious effort has got underway to 
downplay the defence content of the Prime Minister's visit to 
Russia next week, in view of heightened apprehensions both in 
the sub-continent and Western capitals. 
  Defence Ministry officials were at pains to stress on 
Thursday [23 June] that no shopping list for arms had been 
submitted to the Prime Minister. "Prime Ministers do not go 
around looking at fighter planes" said a senior official. 
  In similar vein, officials said no final decision had been 
taken to include Defence Secretary K.A. Nambiar in the Prime 
Minister's entourage. The list of officials would be finalised 
by June 27, that is two days before P.V. Narasimha Rao enplanes 
for Moscow. Working groups comprising officials from the defence 
ministry and the PMO [Prime Minister's Office] are currently 
settling the loose ends, officials said. 
  The change of tack follows close on the heels of reports 
that 
India and Russia were about to assume the strong defence 
relationship that was the centre-piece of Indo-Soviet relations. 
The visits of the respective service chiefs of the two countries 
culminating in joint naval exercises earlier this year had 
raised eyebrows in several capitals. The Government in fact had 
taken the position that the exercises were decided at the last 
minute following a Russian offer, but that explanation satisfied 
few countries in the neighbourhoods, particularly the South East 
Asian nations. 
  In addition,the renewed uncertainty over the F-16s transfer 
to Pakistan has its fall-out over India's responses. To this 
extent the tentative decision to buy 20-odd MiG 29M is being 
projected as part of the normal fleet renewal process, rather 
than as a force augmentation. In any event, the deal for the 
additional fighter planes is not expected to be signed during 
Rao's trip. 
  The attempt to underplay the defence angle to the Russian 
visit comes at a time when the hosts themselves have launched an 
arms hard-sell including opening up their front-line Su-30 
fighter aircraft. While the Russians have turned their full 
sights to India in their arms marketing strategy for South Asia, 
the Indian defence establishment would like the Government to 
keep its options open. 
  The IAF [Indian Air Force] is keen that the Government 
closely examine its proposal for two more squadrons of the air 
superiority French Mirage 2000 as an answer to the F-16s. While 
the MiG-29 is basically an air defence fighter, the F-16 and the 
Mirage 2000 are multi-role warplanes, capable of defending air 
space as well as launching strikes. 
  The straws of a potentially significant military 
relationship 
building up from the rubble of the Soviet Union are however 
clearly visible, despite the Government's protestations. A 
joint venture deal for servicing the Mig-21 series not only 
operated by the IAF but other air forces in this part of the 
world is seen as a tactical move by both partners. Commercial 
interests apart, IAF would be in a better position to handle its 
spares problem once the Russians set up service centres here. 
In similar vein, their offer to set up an assembly line for 
production of the Su-30 is considered significant, tactically, 
although there are reservations in the IAF over its integration 
into the fleet.

<F P=106> [Report by M.R. Narayan Swamy] </F>
  [Text] New Delhi, June 27 (AFP) -- Defence cooperation will 
be high on the agenda when Indian Premier P.V. Narasimha Rao 
travels to Russia on Wednesday [29 June] on a trip aimed at 
reviving the formerly close relations between New Delhi and 
Moscow. Indian officials and diplomats said much of the focus 
of Rao's discussions with Russian leaders, including a 
one-to-one with President Boris Yeltsin, will be on matters 
relating to armaments. 
  The 74-year-old Rao, who holds the defence portfolio, is 
being accompanied by a high-powered delegation that includes 
Defence Secretary K.A. Nambiar. 
  "India has been quite dependent on Russia for defence 
materiel. It will be an occasion to discuss spare parts that 
India needs urgently," said Minister of State for External 
Affairs R.L. Bhatia, who will accompany Rao. 
  "This visit is aimed at strengthening relations with 
Russia," 
Bhatia told AFP. "India had very good relations with the former 
Soviet Union. But in between Russia became interested in the 
West. 
  "Now there is a feeling among Russians that they should also 
look to the East. As such, Rao and Yeltsin will have an 
opportunity to discuss bilateral and international issues." 
  Yeltsin received a warm welcome during a January 1993 visit 
to India. But the bonhomie that was building up was dealt a 
setback when Moscow, under US pressure, reneged on its promise 
to supply cryogenic rocket engines to India. 
Although the Russians eventually agreed to provide the engines 
but not the technology, the issue left a bitter taste among 
Indians long used to Soviet generosity. 
  Bhatia said Rao, who went to the United States last month, 
will also discuss cryogenic technology with Yeltsin during his 
June 29 to July 2 trip. 
  India was hit by an acute shortage of spare parts for its 
gigantic, mostly Soviet-equipped armed forces after the breakup 
of the communist superpower. 
Although shipments have resumed, the Indians want delivery 
speeded up. They are also eyeing a variety of Soviet weapons 
systems that they feel are cheaper than those in the West. 
These include self-propelled guns, air defence systems, the 
deep strike SU-30 aircraft, and a Soviet aircraft carrier. 
Moscow is also ready to fit state-of-the-art avionics and 
missiles on India's MiG-21s. 
  "The visit will give the necessary impetus to political, 
trade, economic, scientific, military and technical cooperation 
between the two countries," said a Russian diplomat here. "We 
hope the visit will prove that Russia conducts a balanced 
foreign policy paying equal attention to the West and the East." 
  Rao, who will stay in the Kremlin, will preside over the 
signing of half-a-dozen documents on a variety of subjects 
including atomic energy, Indian officials said. 
  "Rao's trip is very significant," said Devendra Kaushik, an 
Indian expert on Russia who was in Moscow last month. "In 
defence, we are crucial for each other. Our vested interests 
lie in their strength and vice versa. Collaboration in defence 
will be a serious input in restoring this strategic interest," 
he said. 
  India was the Soviet Union's closest non-communist ally, a 
relationship which clouded New Delhi's ties with the United 
States until the end of the Cold War but helped it cushion 
perceived Western pressures. 
  Russia wants India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, 
to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But Bhatia 
said Yeltsin will be told firmly that the NPT discriminates 
between nuclear haves and have-nots. 
  Bilateral trade, which once stood at seven billion dollars, 
has plummeted to less than one billion dollars. Russia now 
insists on hard currency unlike in the past when the rupee was 
welcome. A Russian proposal to auction part of India's debt to 
the former Soviet Union and offer it at a discount to private 
trading institutions has led to irritants ahead of Rao's 
departure. 
  Kaushik said not everyone around Yeltsin was euphoric about 
India. "So it is time we concentrated on building a (pro-India) 
lobby there," he said, "both in the government and in opposition. 
  "It is time we take initiatives to build bridges with the 
emerging political forces in Russia. [no ending quote as

  [Text] The prime minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's, 
four-day visit to Moscow from tomorrow will mark a new milestone 
in India-Russian relations. This was stated by the Indian 
ambassador in Russia, Mr. Ranendra Sen, to newsmen in Moscow. 
He said the process had been initiated by President Yeltsin 
when he paid a visit to India in January last year. It will get 
a new impetus by the prime minister's forthcoming visit. 
Referring to cooperation in defense matters, Mr. Sen said there 
have been positive developments and the two sides are looking 
for a long-term cooperation in the supply and production of 
defense spares and equipment. 
  Meanwhile, officials in Moscow and New Delhi are giving 
final 
touches to several agreements and a couple of political 
documents to be signed during Mr. Narasimha Rao's visit. The 
prime minister, besides holding one-to-one talk with President 
Yeltsin on bilateral and international issues, will also meet 
many Russian leaders. 
  The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level 
delegation which includes Union Ministers Mr. Pranab Mukherji, 
Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mr. R. L. Bhatia and Mr. Bhvanesh 
Chaturvedi, and defense, finance, and foreign secretaries. Our 
correspondent reports that while trade and commerce will be high 
on the agenda, cooperation in science and technology, atomic 
energy, defense, and tourism will also figure prominently at the 
talks.

  [Text] India has called upon the developing nations for 
joint action to combat new forms of protectionism. The minister 
of state for external affairs, Mr. Salman Khurshid, said 
developing countries should remain especially vigilant against 
those measures that are sought to be promoted in the guise of 
social and environmental concerns. Mr. Khurshid was addressing 
the special meeting of G-77 [Group of 77] developing nations in 
New York yesterday. He said it is important for the developing 
countries to ensure that their major trading partners in the 
industrial world observe the rule of law and of free trade and 
competition.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "A Turnabout in Rabin's Position"] </F>
  [Text] Up until several days ago, there was a consensus 
that the government, with its commitment to the principle of 
freedom of religion and free access to the holy sites of all 
religions, would prevent Yasir 'Arafat from visiting the Temple 
Mount (Haram al- Sharif). The prime minister's announcement, 
made public in two Friday afternoon newspapers, came as a 
surprise and created a new situation. 
  "As a Muslim, 'Arafat, is entitled to visit Jerusalem, just 
like any other Muslim. If he wishes to pray, that would be his 
right. There would be a problem of timing and arrangements, but 
in principle our reply would be positive." That is how Yitzhaq 
Rabin responded when asked whether he was inviting 'Arafat to 
visit Jerusalem. The prime minister avoided responding in the 
negative, and by putting the stress on 'Arafat's right -- "like 
any other Muslim" -- to worship in a place holy to the Muslims 
(the al-Aqsa mosque), it could be seen as an invitation. The 
reservations about timing and arrangements appear to be minor 
points compared with the positive reply in principle. 
  Is the prime minister so naive as to believe that the PLO 
leader's appearance at Haram al-Sharif would not be far more 
than just a religious event? We should not think he is being 
naive: He does not need too much imagination to foresee how 
'Arafat's praying at the al-Aqsa mosque and his visit to the 
Dome of the Rock would have an impact on the Muslim population. 
They will be elated by his visit, East Jerusalem will become a 
PLO bastion, and the Arabs in the territories will regard 
Israeli permission for the visit -- supposedly meant to honor 
the Muslim holy places -- as a move toward the Israel 
Government's agreement to the guest's nationalist- political 
demands for Palestinian sovereignty in East Jerusalem. That is 
how Arafat's appearance, under the guise of being a Muslim 
pilgrim, will be seen in the Arab world as well. 
  Israel's commitment to freedom of access to the holy places 
of all religions, as expressed in the Declaration of 
Independence, is, of course, known to the prime minister. He is 
right in saying that "we cannot insist on united Jerusalem being 
Israel's capital without permitting freedom of access to members 
of other religions." But expressing a readiness to permit 
'Arafat to worship on the Temple Mount at this time does not 
necessarily evolve from that understanding. 
  Has the prime minister been won over to the opinion of 
former 
adviser Jacques Neriya that 'Arafat might be offended if Israel 
refuses to permit him to pray on Haram al-Sharif, considering 
the fact that Rabin, in his Strasbourg speech, invited Mu'ammar 
al- Qadhdhafi to fulfill that religious decree? Did Rabin plan 
to permit the PLO leader to precede the Hashemite king? In his 
newspaper interview, Rabin mentioned al-Qadhdhafi, President al- 
Asad, and the Saudi monarch, and his failure to mention the 
Jordanian monarch is striking in that context. Can Rabin's 
willingness to compromise with the PLO leader be explained by 
his understanding that it is impossible to keep him restricted 
to Jericho? 
  It is difficult to believe that the prime minister is 
unaware 
of the political consequences of 'Arafat's praying at the 
al-Aqsa mosque. What right does he have to denounce opposition 
spokesmen who "say that such visits (meaning Nabil Sha'th's 
visit, which the government prevented) put into question 
Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem, which is a big mistake." 
Up to Friday, Rabin thought just like those leaders of the 
right-wing parties. 
  In view of the possibility that Yasir 'Arafat might be 
coming 
to pray at al-Aqsa, the attempts to restrict PLO political 
activities in East Jerusalem seem impractical. We can insist 
that "no body with a role in the Palestinian Authority will be 
located in Jerusalem," but if 'Arafat is permitted to come to 
Jerusalem's Old City, how will we be able to complain about the 
activities of Faysal al-Husayni and his friends?

  [Excerpt] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that general 
public opinion notwithstanding, the Shamgar Commission report is 
harsh and includes sharp criticism on various issues, such as 
law enforcement in the territories. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir 
reports that the prime minister told the Labor Knesset faction 
he considers the report as the commission's way of dealing with 
a complicated situation and criticizing the operation of certain 
systems. Rabin emphasized that the government will implement 
all the conclusions and recommendations, adding that the report 
will make it easier for him to determine prayer and security 
procedures in the Cave of the Patriarchs and especially to 
enforce the arrangements on Jewish worshipers. 
  Yitzhaq Rabin rejected the statement of Ari'el Sharon -- 
without spelling out his name -- that contrary to previous 
commissions of inquiry, the Shamgar Commission has not placed 
any ministerial responsibility on anybody. Rabin said that 
contrary to the Lebanon War, where the government made a 
concrete decisions to enter Beirut, the Shamgar Commission has 
dealt with an unpredictable event which was not initiated by the 
government. 
  Regarding the reports on Ron Arad's fate, the prime minister 
says Israel has considerable information regarding Ron Arad's 
fate up to 1989. In the past he was held by Mustafa al-Dirani 
who was a member of the Amal organization. He was then turned 
over to Hizballah and Iran. Syria could also have done more 
than it has on this issue. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Speaking at a General Staff forum on the Shamgar 
Commission's recommendations, the chief of staff said the IDF 
[Israel Defense Forces] will make preparations to implement the 
commission's conclusions speedily and fully. 
  Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe notes that in 
the wake of the commission's criticism, the IDF will soon issue 
orders and clarifications concerning the use of gunfire against 
settlers and violations of law and order in the territories by 
Jews. 
  The Cave of the Patriarchs will open only when all the 
security arrangements are in place and the complete separation 
of Jews and Arabs is assured. The IDF will maintain a guard 
force at the cave and bar armed worshipers from the site. IDF 
sources stress that Army elements had cautioned already last 
year that the law was not being enforced against settlers and 
had requested police reinforcements at the site. IDF elements 
stress that procedures for cooperation between the army and the 
police are of vital importance at this time.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Shlomo Raz] </F>
  [Excerpts] The Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's 
bureau disagree on the priorities to be pursued in the 
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. While the former favors what 
the Declaration of Principles and the Cairo agreement term 
intensification [preceding word in English], the latter prefers 
to wait until the Gaza-Jericho autonomy has established itself. 
  The nature and timetable of the next stage will be decided 
at 
Rabin and Peres' upcoming summit meeting with 'Arafat in Paris 
next week, when the three men will be awarded a special UNESCO 
prize. The occasion will be used for political talks. 
  The Foreign Ministry top echelons held a discussion 
yesterday 
on the next stage of negotiations. Their approach can be summed 
up by saying that they support accelerating the negotiations and 
expanding them beyond the five areas Israel is to transfer to 
the Palestinians. The five areas are direct taxation, health, 
education, tourism, and labor. The Foreign Ministry believes 
the Palestinians should receive additional powers in economic 
spheres. 
  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres yesterday reiterated his 
position that the residents of major cities in the territories 
should be allowed to run their lives by themselves. [passage 
omitted] 
  The prime minister's bureau has a different opinion. In 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's view, the first thing to do is to 
ascertain that progress is being made in Gaza and Jericho and 
that civilian spheres are being attended to, in addition to the 
already operational police force. He believes that only at that 
point should the next stage of negotiations be contemplated.

  [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres says he favors early 
empowerment in towns in the West Bank. In an address to the 
Jewish Agency's annual assembly in Jerusalem last night, Peres 
said the Palestinians have the right to run their own lives: 
  [Begin Peres recording] No, I do not see any reason why we 
should not go ahead with what is being called the early 
empowerment, particularly in the large cities like Nabulus, 
Ramallah. Why should we be there as their tax collectors, as 
their teachers? They have their own curriculum. Why should we 
force them to read our curriculum? I mean, the idea that their 
agony is not necessarily our happiness is basic. 
  You know, some people criticize me that while during the 
negotiations I agreed to give almost a passport to the Gazan 
people. I did not understand this criticism. What joy does it 
give us? There will be 800,000 people without passports. We did 
not want to give them ours. Why should we take away from them 
the right to have a passport? I never saw a person killing 
another person by hitting a passport on his head, but I saw a 
person killing because they did not have a passport. Let us be 
a little wise and generous. I do not see why should we not let 
the people to run their daily lives, though I admit I consider 
that the negotiations with the Palestinians over the principle 
of early empowerment, which means to hand over some of the 
responsibilities in the other parts of the territories to their 
hands, will be very complicated and very difficult, but we have 
to start and go ahead. [end recording] 
  Peres also said it would be useless to link the release of 
Palestinian prisoners to obtaining information on missing and 
captured Israeli soldiers. Israel believes Ron Arad is held by 
Iran, which opposes the peace process, Peres said. He said the 
government takes the matter seriously, but he added that telling 
the Palestinians the peace process will not continue until more 
information is obtained will not help, since the missing 
Israelis are not being held by Yasir 'Arafat. 
  [Begin Peres recording] We do not believe that the missing 
soldiers are in his hands and that the ones who have control 
over it are not necessarily listening to 'Arafat. So if we 
shall do it, we shall introduce a service against ourselves. It 
will be totally counterproductive. [end recording]

  [Text] The Palestinian Covenant is to be amended at the 
first meeting of the Palestinian Council in Gaza. This was 
stated this evening by Nabil Sha'th, the chief Palestinian 
negotiator, who was making a rare appearance on an Israel radio 
phone-in show. This was what Sha'th had to say in answer to a 
listener's question: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] We have committed ourselves to the 
amendments of the charter. All our existing present 
organizations, Executive Committee, and so on, have approved 
these amendments, and now we are moving toward holding the 
Palestine National Council -- which I hope will be in Gaza -- so 
that these amendments will be made. [end recording] 
  And on the controversial question of the division of 
sovereignty and power in Jerusalem, this is how Nabil Sha'th 
outlined the Palestinian position: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] Well, I think if we are thinking of 
long-term peace, real and stable peace, we must be thinking in 
terms of equals, and equals means two neighboring states side by 
side, and this means, again, sharing Palestine. But it also 
means sharing Jerusalem. It's not a question of being naive or 
not. I think people are not all yet decided about real peace. 
Some people think they can delay the real dividends and price 
of peace, and they are getting to learn gradually that this 
means real rights for the Palestinians, including the right of 
self-determination, which means if we choose a state then we 
have a right to live side by side in two states in peace. [end 
recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 27 June, 
reporting on Sha'th's Israel radio phone-in appearance, adds: 
"Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that Yasir 'Arafat has promised Yitzhaq 
Rabin to do his best to locate the Israeli POW's and MIA's. To 
the best of his knowledge they are located in Lebanon and Syria, 
in areas which are not under the PLO's control. Nabil Sha'th 
said he is aware of the fact that this issue is traumatic to the 
families involved and to the entire Israeli people." 
  ["Asked why Palestinian industrialists are refusing to 
cooperate with their Israeli counterparts, Sha'th said the 
autonomy authorities are interested in cooperating with the 
Israeli economy, but they do not want to depend on it, because 
such a dependency will eventually make things harder for the 
Israeli economy as well."]

  [Text] Speaking to our correspondents yesterday, Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that in the coming two years, the 
government will focus on economic and education issues. He 
noted that one of the goals his government has so far failed to 
achieve is keeping inflation under 10-percent. 
  According to him, the fact that the government has served 
half its term does not change anything with regard to the peace 
moves. Mr. Rabin is determined to complete his term, even with a 
minority government. The prime minister was reacting to a 
public opinion poll conducted by the statistics department of 
Haifa University on the occasion of the government completing a 
two-year term. 
  Those polled gave the Rabin government a performance grade 
of 
5.3 on a scale of 10. Some 29 percent of those polled view 
Rabin as their preferred candidate for prime minister, 14 
percent favor Netanyahu, 8 percent chose Shim'on Peres, and 
Hayim Ramon and Ari'el Sharon each won the support of 4 percent. 
The poll surveyed 650 people.

  [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that as long as 
he is prime minister no tax will be imposed on stock market 
profits. I opposed such a move in the past, and I still oppose 
it, Rabin said. The prime minister reiterated that the stock 
market does not reflect the economy, which is growing. The 
stock exchange is not a casino but an institute for calculated 
investments. Our Tel Aviv economic correspondent Ya'ir Fiedel 
reports that Rabin said the economy is generally in excellent 
shape, except for certain areas, such as inflation and housing 
prices, which require pinpointed treatment. Rabin was addressing 
business leaders.

<F P=106> [Article by Hana Qim: "The Primaries Have Already Started"] </F>
  [Text] Two worn out phrases from the days of the Likud's 
war of the camps came back from oblivion last week. Remember 
how ministers and Knesset members [MK] used to react when asked 
for their camp affiliation? "There are no camps in Likud," they 
would say as the war of the camps raged and deals between camps 
flourished. "What camp I am in? The Likud camp." Now, that 
the political negotiations are back in the headlines, MK Eli 
Dayan uttered the two sentences that will from now on describe 
the situation of the Labor Party: "I have no group in Labor," 
he said. "I belong to the Labor Party group." 
  There are no camps in Labor, there are only "groups" or 
"ideological circles." Here is yet another example of the 
process of privatization the ruling party is undergoing. The 
process does not aim at promoting some ideology or supporting 
the peace process. It aims at pushing the person or persons 
heading the circle into a realistic slot on the next Knesset 
list: 
  The Ma'alot circle of MK Rafi Edri; the New Direction circle 
of Minister Shim'on Shetrit (who recently established a "group" 
named The Jerusalem Forum); Ra'anan Kohen's Re'ut circle; the 
Unification of Ranks circle of Shlomo Buhbut; Rafi Elul's social 
lobby group; Mikha Goldman's Next Generation circle; the 
Lamerhav circle of Shoshana Arbeli-Almozlino, members of which 
are 'Imanu'el Zismann and other veteran hawks; the Alternative 
circle of Ofir Pinhas who appeals to the party's young members; 
The Forum for Political and Social Thinking of Shlomo Ben-'Ami 
and Avigdor Ben-Gal who want to be MK's (if not ministers) in 
the next Knesset; the Hofit circle of Ori Or and the hawks gang; 
The Histadrut Forum of Pini Shumer, a member of the Rabin camp; 
the newly founded circle of Minister Moshe Shahal, which last 
week convened at the Oil Institute in Tel Aviv; and Minister 
Mikha Harish's Leshiluv Circle which is currently inactive, but 
there is reason to believe that it will soon be revived under 
this or other name. And there are the doves' Kefar Hayaroq and 
Mashov circles; Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer is expected to 
establish his own circle soon; and Minister Efrayim Sne already 
has a "group" and a "circle" is expected to be founded soon. 
  "You can no longer see the party from the circles and 
groups," MK Eli Dayan said grumpily. "I heard there are MK's 
who belong to several ideological circles and groups," he said. 
Dayan himself is indeed a living example for this: He is 
associated with Rafi Edri's circle, with Shim'on Shetrit's 
circle, the new Shlomo Buhbut circle, and may soon set up his 
own circle. 
  After Hayim Ramon quit the party, and after it transpired 
that Gershon Gelman [head of the Labor list of the Tel Aviv 
labor council who signed a local coalition agreement with Likud] 
can disregard Yitzhaq Rabin's directives, early preparations for 
the primaries for the Labor list for the next Knesset elections 
have begun. In an interview with Lili Galili and Amnon 
Abramovich for HA'ARETZ, Shim'on Peres made very frustrated 
comments about this. Nevertheless, Peres -- with some of his men 
behind several of the new circles -- also understands that this 
phenomena taking place because of the need to replace the 
crumbling organizational infrastructure of Labor. 
  In a closed meeting with members of his camp, Prime 
Minister Rabin described the situation thus: The main problem 
Labor is facing today is the fact that Histadrut employees, most 
of whom are party members, are about to be laid off and become 
unemployed. "Some 1,500 of our men are facing an economic, 
existential problem," he said. What is he going to do about the 
unemployed party activists? "Believe me," Rabin went on, "when 
I was defense minister I fired 3,000 people." In other words, 
Rabin will not find new jobs for them because Rabin, just like 
Ramon, no longer believes in the outdated organizational 
structure of the Labor Party. It can be assumed that the 
activists without income will join some of the groups and 
circles only to have something to do, and perhaps find a source 
of income. 
  "None of the groups is ideological and none of the groups is 
serious," said Minister 'Uzi Bar'am, who today cooperates with 
the Mashov and Kefar Hayaroq circles. "People want to prove 
they exist because the primaries' race has begun. Hayim Ramon 
is everybody's role model. Because he succeeded, they are 
trying to show the public what they are worth. All the power 
structures of Labor in the local labor councils and the 
Histadrut Executive Committee are falling apart. In this 
atmosphere of uncertainty, people are beginning to think about 
their personal future. I have even heard that some of the MK's 
and ministers have begun collecting funds for the primaries." 
  It is to be assumed that in the coming year the registrar of 
non- profit associations will be busy registering associations 
established for noble causes which will begin collecting funds 
from businessmen for the next Knesset race. One of those 
competing for the next Knesset last week said that he had 
contacted several businessmen asking for their contribution. 
The businessmen asked him whether he was in any way connected 
to Hayim Ramon because, they said, they have already invested in 
Ramon. 
  The next Knesset elections will take place in two years' 
time, but already now, some 18 months before the party primaries 
are held, tension could be easily felt. Minister Moshe Shahal 
-- one of the first Laborites to speak about recognizing the 
Palestinians and establishing a Palestinian state, even before 
Yosi Beilin -- today speaks about the need to "return to the 
center of the political map." That is to say that the 
primaries might not only have an impact on the frequency of 
appearances by politicians on TV talks shows, but also on the 
political process.

  [Text] Israel and Tunisia are discussing a possibile 
opening of representation offices next month, for the first 
time. Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin left for Paris this morning for a 
working visit, in the course of which he will meet with the top 
echelons of the French Foreign Ministry. Among other things, he 
will try to promote the Israel-Tunisia relations. In some two 
weeks, Beilin will travel to Tunisia as head of the Israeli 
delegation for the steering committee of the multilateral peace 
talks. In his meetings with top Tunisian officials, he will 
attempt to conclude the establishment of relations, perhaps a 
mutual opening of interest offices.

<F P=106> [Report on news conference by Major General Herzl Budinger, </F>
Air Force commander, on the occasion of Air Force Day by Yariv 
Ben-Yehuda on 27 June; place not given -- italicized passages 
recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Ben-Yehuda] Referring to the 
German television report, according to which Ron Arad was held 
captive by Syria from 1987 to 1989, Major General Herzl Budinger 
said: As far as I know, their investigation is wrong, erroneous. 
  [Budinger] I am a veteran participant in working and 
discussion teams on Ron Arad's condition and the possibility of 
bringing him back home, but in none of these discussions did I 
hear of or receive information about that possibility, and I 
think it is erroneous. I can say for myself that I have never 
received such information. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] Gen. Budinger went on to say: The premises 
concerning Ron Arad's condition have not changed, and the odds 
that he is alive today are high. 
  [Budinger] Pieces of information received from diverse 
sources, which can never be cross-checked, indicate in a very 
reliable way that Ron Arad is probably alive and is being kept 
somewhere in the Middle East -- either by Iranians or by 
organizations controlled by Iranians. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] Is the interrogation of Mustafa al-Dirani 
making satisfactory progress? 
  [Budinger] It is, as far as I know. The investigation 
has elicited a great deal of information, which is still 
sensitive and cannot, therefore, be shared with the public. 
[passage omitted] 
  [Ben-Yehuda] The chief addressed what he termed the Air 
Force's highly accelerated procurement process. As we all know, 
the first batch of F-15I, Israel's future combat aircraft, will 
be received in 1997. Prior to that, procurement will follow a 
very crowded timetable. 
  [Budinger] Beginning in August 1994, the first surplus 
F-16's will start arriving. In September, they will be joined 
by Black Hawk helicopters. A few months later, the second batch 
of F-16's will be received, the total being some 50 aircraft. 
At a later stage, we will receive F-15's. 
  [Ben-Yehuda] Replying to reporters' questions, Gen. Budinger 
addressed the possibility of withdrawal from the Golan. He said 
that no staff work is under way on the possibility of withdrawal 
from the Golan, but he confirmed that a brief discussion had 
been held on the possibility of handing the Americans a 
procurement list for the event decisions concerning the Golan 
are made and processes take place. Israel will seek restitution 
for the loss of early warning systems scattered throughout the 
north by acquiring equivalent systems, probably including AWACS 
[Airborne Warning and Command System]. 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1500 GMT on 27 June 
adds: "Referring to regional armament, Budinger said the Air 
Force is monitoring the operating methods of surface-to-surface 
missiles being purchased by the Arab countries. Budinger said 
that if these missiles cause serious damage to the Israeli home 
front, Israel will consider striking at the enemy's home front. 
Budinger also said the Syrian Army has resumed its links with 
Russia and is continuing to purchase Russian weapons. Gen. 
Budinger told our correspondent Karmela Menashe that Iran is 
turning into the next nuclear power, and Israel cannot deal with 
this issue on its own -- international bodies have to deal with 
this issue. Budinger also said that over the next few weeks the 
first helicopters will arrive in Gaza and Jericho. They will be 
mainly used by the Palestinians to convey officials between the 
two regions. Budinger added that an Air Force representative 
attends all the meetings with the Palestinians and every 
Palestinian flight between Gaza and Jericho will depend on 
Israeli approval and control. The air force commander also says 
that Israel and Jordan have held preliminary discussions 
regarding the flight of Jordanian planes through Israeli 
airspace. He said that if an agreement is reached on the issue, 
it will be possible to determine an aerial corridor without 
harming Israel's security."]

<F P=106> [Report by Army affairs correspondent Yariv Ben-Yehuda] </F>
  [Text] A dream came true for four Israeli pilots, 
including Brigadier General D., head of an Air Force division: 
They flew an enemy aircraft. The flights took place in an East 
European country about six months ago, BIT'ON HEYL HA'AVIR 
reveals in this week's issue. The pilots flew the MiG-29 -- 
the Arab countries' most advanced aircraft -- four times, with 
each flight lasting approximately 20 minutes at a temperature 
under 0 degrees centigrade. 
  This unique opportunity to inspect the plane yielded several 
distinct conclusions. According to one of the pilots, the 
MiG-29 is easy to operate and maneuver and is energetic and well 
equipped. It has excellent radar, a very advanced detection 
system, and a more sophisticated throttle than that of the F-16. 
As for its aerodynamic performance, it definitely belongs to 
the state-of-the- art aircraft in the category of the F-15 and 
F-16. 
  The most important conclusion for us: The MiG-29 is 
incapable of reaching Israeli borders from either Iraq or Iran, 
although it certainly can pose a threat to Israeli aircraft

head summed up: We have a clear advantage over this aircraft, 
but if we are forced to confront it, we may run a certain risk.

<F P=106> [Report by military correspondent Arye Kiesel] </F>
  [Text] An experiment to test the impact of a Scud falling 
in a densely populated area was conducted for the first time 
yesterday in the south of the country, in cooperation with the 
United States. 
  Major General Ze'ev Livne, commander of the Home Front 
Command, said that the command manufactured a missile containing 
hundreds of kgs of explosives, similar to the Scuds owned by 
Syria and other Arab countries. The missile was detonated in an 
open training range strewn with reinforced structures. 
  The explosion was designed to test the efficacy of Israel's 
security concept with regard to the home front: the "reinforced 
structure," which is a thick-walled room. 
  The Americans who observed the experiment checked the 
resistance of various types of windows in light of the 
conclusions drawn from the World Trade Center explosion in New 
York, as well as for other U.S. defense components. The results 
of the experiment will be sent today to laboratories in the 
United States, and the findings will be relayed to Israel. 
  This joint experiment is part of a series of tests conducted 
over the last two years to prepare the Home Front Command. 
  Gen. Livne stated that 100,000 building containing 
"reinforced rooms" have been built to date in Israel. These 
buildings offer a solution to 300,000 Israelis, he said, and 
within five years most buildings in Israel will be similarly 
equipped.

  [Text] A sixth police district -- the Judaea and Samaria 
District -- was inaugurated today. It will be made up of two 
subdistricts: the Judaea and the Samaria subdistricts. Police 
Minister Shahal, who presented the rank of commander to Alex 
Ron, who will head the new district, said that Israel recognizes 
the need to deal with routine security among both the Jewish and 
the Arab sectors in Judaea and Samaria. Minister Shahal said 
that the manpower being transferred to the new district will 
come at the expense of the Israel Police. Border Police forces 
will also join the new district. The headquarters of the new 
Judaea and Samaria District has been set up in Ra's al-'Amud in 
East Jerusalem, and when Commander Alex Ron enters next week, he 
will find a headquarters that has already begun to operate.

<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Dr. Husayn Abu-Salih by </F>
unidentified correspondent in Tunis; date not given] 
  [Text] [AL-HAYAH] Do you expect any progress in achieving 
a peaceful solution to the southern Sudan problem? 
  [Abu-Salih] The conflict in the south would not have 
continued had it not been for the aid the rebel movement is 
receiving. It could not have gone on fighting all this time had 
it not been for foreign aid and support in terms of armament, 
training, and food. 
  In the days of (former Ethiopian President) Mengistu Haile 
Mariam it used to obtain the aid from Eastern Europe and the 
Soviet bloc, which set up camps for it. The movement was 
expected to weaken and disappear following Mengistu's collapse, 
but the rebellion continued as a result of the change in the 
movement's and its supporters' direction. 
  This issue and the accusations raised about it reflect a lot 
of bias and distortion of the real picture of what is happening 
in Sudan. 
  I believe that the issue was tackled in various periods in 
accordance with the wish of Sudan -- people, government, and 
public organizations -- since 1985 to secure a peaceful and 
rational solution to the problem through dialogue. 
  But due to the rebel movement's adherence to its position 
and 
the support it received from some forces, it is still an 
obstacle to a peaceful solution -- which has caused us to hold a 
gun in one hand and an olive branch in the other. The Armed 
Forces should play their role not in order to impose a military 
solution, but to curb and weaken the movement so that it will 
submit and come to the negotiating table. 
  At one point there was bias with regard to Sudan because of 
inaccurate information, like describing what is happening as a 
war launched by the Arab north against non-Arab southerners, or 
by Muslims against Christians, or as forcible Islamization of 
southern Sudan. All these accusations are absolutely untrue. 
We organized a conference which irrefutably proved that the 
problem is political. It analyzed its roots and drew up a 
solution to it. 
  The issue is to produce an equation that achieves fair 
power-sharing so that no party, group, or entity will be 
deprived of political participation. Power can be shared 
through decentralization and a federal system, namely by 
dividing the country into small units to achieve real 
distribution of power and the various natural resources and thus 
move toward balanced development. 
  In this way religion can have a place and people can live 
equally without the majority imposing their view on the 
minority. This is why we agreed on the need to describe Sudan as 
a miniature Africa. It is characterized by diversity and 
unified history at the same time. This is why we decided not to 
focus on using phrases, but instead, define what we want, namely 
a multiethnic, multicultural, multireligious, and multilingual 
Sudan. Identity should be "Sudanese." Citizenship be based on 
participation. These ideas can form the foundation of a just 
peaceful solution. But the reason behind this intransigence is 
that the movement is a hostage of foreign forces that do not 
want these principles to be complied with. 
  [AL-HAYAH] From where does Colonel John Garang's movement 
get the foreign aid? 
  [Abu-Salih] The aid comes through the Sudanese-Ugandan 
border, and the arms are smuggled through a small strip a few 
kilometers wide. Contacts are being made with the Ugandan 
Government so that the two parties will undertake not to harm 
one another or provide facilities to smuggle arms across the 
border. Such commitment shortens the road to peace. 
  [AL-HAYAH] What did the U.S. envoy convey to the Sudanese 
Government, and what was the aim of her recent visit to Khartoum? 
  [Abu-Salih] We note that the West in general was biased with 
regard to Sudan, although the present Sudanese Government has 
never said anything about boycotting or being hostile toward the 
West or sought such a thing. Its view has been that there 
should be cooperation with the West, especially in the spheres 
of development, science, technology, and other sectors. 
However, what we reject is that there should be a kind of 
superiority, domination, and interference in Sudan's internal 
affairs. The West did at one point adopt tough positions on the 
basis of erroneous information about Sudan. Perhaps that 
encouraged the rejection of dialogue with the Sudanese 
Government or encouraged working to topple it. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Who conveyed the wrong picture about Sudan? 
  [Abu-Salih] First, Britain did a great deal to spread 
erroneous ideas and false rumors to distort Sudan's image; it 
conveyed to the United States untrue pictures of the situation 
in the country. This is why the dialogue with the Americans is 
aimed at conveying a real picture about Sudan with regard to its 
willingness to cooperate with other countries. 
  [AL-HAYAH] When did the dialogue begin? 
  [Abu-Salih] The dialogue stage began after the visit by 
Madeleine Albright, U.S. permanent representative to the United 
Nations, to Khartoum this year. It means that there is 
willingness to listen and there are attentive ears. The mere 
fact of engaging in a serious dialogue makes us optimistic about 
the possibility of reaching a model for cooperation with a major 
state like the United States. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Do you expect this understanding to influence 
Sudan's position on the Middle East peace process? 
  [Abu-Salih] The United States and the West exerted pressures 
on Sudan because of its position on the peace process. They 
thought we were going to lead Arab and Islamic opposition and 
all the parties opposed to the process, which is why we were put 
on the terrorism list. 
  But Ambassador Albright came out with a good impression 
regarding this question after its recent visit to Sudan. She 
pointed to her belief that Sudan shelters and sponsors 
terrorists, but we explained to her that these accusations are 
absolutely untrue. And we stressed the need for further talks, 
contacts, and visits. 
  The Sudanese people are very remote from terrorism, in terms 
of their nature and behavior. They refuse to harm others. The 
Americans had thought that there were camps in Sudan to train 
foreigners and send them to some states to undermine stability 
there, but the camps in the country are only used to train 
Popular Defense men who support the the Sudanese Army in its 
task in the south. We challenge anyone to prove that a single 
foreigner has been trained in Sudan; ON the contrary, we are 
harmed by others' interference in our affairs. 
  [AL-HAYAH] Perhaps your special relationship with Iran 
provoked these accusations. 
  [Abu-Salih] The United States and other Western states talk 
about Sudan as though it is controlled by Iran or is a base for 
Iran in the region. Our relations with Iran are like our 
relations with any Western state. There is nothing more between 
us and it. In fact maybe the level of our relations with Iran is 
lower than the level of our relations with some Western states. 
Ambassador Albright's visit came to clarify this matter, 
especially as it coincided with our appeal to some neighboring 
states like Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia to sponsor the peace 
process in the south. 
  We are in the process of preparing a document regarding 
participation in power and dialogue so as to ensure the success 
of the process. We have also asked the Americans to offer us 
technical assistance regarding the federal system so as to 
provide us with a plan that would help us to achieve the formula 
we are seeking for Sudan, namely a multiethnic, multilingual, 
and multireligious Sudan, provided the identity is "Sudanese."

claims that he has resigned and asked for political asylum in 
Sweden. Sources in the Sudanese capital claimed over the weekend 
that Mohammad Zein left his post after the Sudanese Government 
recalled him to Khartoum, but the ambassador said today he had 
no intention of resigning. Sudanese sources said Mr. Zein had 
held office under the former government of Sadeq al-Mahdi, who

  [Excerpt] Khartoum, 27 June (KNA/PANA) -- Egypt has 
released 89 Sudanese nationals in the northern town of Aswan, 
after denying them entry and detaining them, state-run 
television of Omdurman reported late Saturday [25 June]. It 
reported that the Sudanese were held for seven hours. The 
travellers, mostly middle-aged men, told the television that 
they were held in a dining hall in a ferry named Saq al-Naam 
somewhere between Aswan and Wadi Halfa. They were denied 
drinking water and the opportunity to pray. The detainees said 
they were packed in a hot room without air-conditioning, while 
told by an Egyptian official that they would be allowed to 
continue to Cairo. Detainees said they were guarded by regular 
armed Egyptian troops during their interrogations and that they 
were returned back to Sudan without any explanation. 
  Only old men and women were allowed to proceed to Cairo but 
all able-bodied and young men were returned to Sudan. The 
Sudanese travellers, who appeared frustrated and upset, told the 
Sudan television that their luggage and money had been stolen 
while they were in detention. 
  Commenting, Sudanese television said that it was clear that 
the Egyptian authorities had adopted the measure as a precaution 
against any infiltration of alleged Islamic fundamentalists.

second reading. 
  Finance Minister Abdullah Hasan Ahmad, in his commentary on 
the members' deliberations on the budget's general features, 
stressed that the budget achieved all national aims and 
aspirations in revenue and expenditure, as well as dealing with 
the challenge for self-sufficiency. He added that it achieved 
total financing for the agricultural sector, as well as 
supporting the federal system and the poorer strata of society.

clauses meant to achieve peace and development, and that the 
government was committed to spending in accordance with its real 
revenue earnings, explaining that a clear improvement had

grain stocks. The finance minister described the effects of 
foreign trade, border trade, and preferential trade on the 
national economy as positive. 
  Mr. Abdullah Hasan Ahmad discussed subsidies, stating that

  [Text] The proceedings of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] 
Ministerial Council's 15th session ended yesterday at Djnan el 
Mithaq Residence. Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah 
Dembri, who chaired the proceedings, delivered a closing speech 
in which he stressed the excellent positive results that were 
achieved during this session, and which will undoubtedly 
contribute toward boosting and entrenching the Maghreban 
unionist action. 
  Here now follows a statement given by the foreign minister 
to 
our colleague Ahmed Kheda, in which he assessed the results of 
the session: 
  [Begin Dembri recording] The session had a special 
importance 
because for the first time the agenda enabled us to conduct a 
profound study on how to renew the working method of the AMU. 
On the other hand, during this session we managed to break away 
from traditional considerations and begin building economic 
integration. 
  As you are aware, Algeria tabled three proposals relating to 
the construction of factories whose products would meet all 
Maghreban needs like railways, pipelines etc... This is a new 
working method, and I believe that the foreign ministers have 
placed the Maghreban train on the right track. 
  This is the conclusion I got from this session. In parallel, 
our political consultation was excellent, because for the first 
time we witnessed the presence of a Maghreban sensitivity 
without any divergence in opinions, especially when we reviewed 
all issues on the international level, and everything that 
affects the common Arab destiny. [end recording]

  [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri 
received today the Yemeni parliamentary delegation led by Mr. 
'Abd al-Wahab Mahmud, deputy speaker of the parliament and 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The delegation is 
visiting Algeria in the framework of a mission aimed at 
informing and consulting with the Transitional National Council. 
  A Foreign Ministry statement said that the talks dealt with 
the latest developments in Yemen. In this respect, the Yemeni 
delegation gave the parliament's view on the fratricidal 
fighting that is tearing the country apart. The delegation also 
expressed the parliament's desire to use every means to achieve 
a settlement of the conflict with the help of sister and 
friendly countries. 
  The statement added that Mr. Dembri had insisted on the 
pressing need for the warring sides to stop the fighting in 
order to provide the minimum conditions for the resumption of 
the dialogue and open the way to a peaceful settlement of the 
conflict. In this context, the minister affirmed Algeria's 
readiness to contribute to the efforts aimed at ending the 
conflict between the brothers in Yemen.

  [Text] The court of criminal appeal of Algiers Judicial 
Council today issued a ruling in the case of the deceased 
president, Mohamed Boudiaf, and decided to refer the defendant 
Boumaarafi Lembarek to the criminal court of Algiers Judicial 
Council. Boumaarafi is charged with committing a premeditated 
murder, causing deliberate injuries with firearms, and planning 
to topple the regime. These crimes are punishable in accordance 
with Articles 254, 255, 261, 256, 257, 77, and 266 of the penal 
code. 
  It is worth noting that the court of criminal appeal had, on 
1 March 1994, ruled in favor of further investigations into the 
case to examine all the elements of the inquiry. Afterwards the 
measures linked to these additional inquiries were implemented 
by the examining magistrate who was busy completing the 
investigation entrusted to him. At the end of his mission, the 
magistrate sent the file back to the court of criminal appeal of 
Algiers Judicial Council which, after examining it, ruled to 
refer the defendant Boumaarafi Lembarek to the criminal court of 
Algiers Judicial Council. Thus, the case is now ready to be 
examined at a trial. The trial is due to start in July 1994, in 
accordance with the provisions of the law.

  [Text] Following the French foreign minister's statement 
affirming France's readiness to host direct talks between the 
Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de 
Oro [Polisario] and Morocco, the Information Ministry of the 
Saharan Democratic Arab Republic issued the following statement: 
  The Polisario Front [word indistinct] France's desire to 
host 
direct talks between the Front and the Kingdom of Morocco, which 
was expressed by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to JEUNE AFRIQUE 
weekly this week. 
  The statement added that the Front considers France to be 
neutral, unbiased, and interested in the stability of the Arab 
Maghreb region. It could therefore contribute to a 
rapprochement between the two parties to the conflict in the 
Western Sahara (?by providing a just basis for a resolution of 
the conflict within the framework of the UN peace plan). 
  The statement said the Polisario Front remains [word 
indistinct] at this critical time (?in view of) the UN peace 
plan and Morocco's obstacles. However, the path of direct talks 
would give the two conflicting parties a chance to overcome 
their differences and help attain security and stability in the 
region.

children--were injured. 
  The report adds that this savage attack occurred on the eve 
of a meeting of the country's governors in Herat and was an

meeting is scheduled to be held in two days--on 28 June. In 
addition to the country's governors, a number of social and 
scientific personalities from in and out of Afghanistan will

  [Excerpts] With the help of Almighty God, the strategic 
hill of Maranjan and the surrounding areas have been captured by 
the Islamic Army of Afghanistan. The army's advance continues. 
Maranjan Hill was captured by the mojahedin 17 hours after the 
conquest of Bala Hesar base. 
  With regard to today's conquest, an official of the Ministry 
of Defense said: 
  [Begin unidentified Defense Ministry official recording, in 
Dari] [Words indistinct] operation started at about 0500 by the 
forces of the Islamic Army from several directions: from the 
direction of Bala Hesar and Maiwand Wat, and [word indistinct] 
and Pol-e Pacha Khan. [words indistinct] 
  The Islamic State of Afghanistan, so far as possible, 
exercised forbearance in order to find a peaceful solution to 
Afghanistan's problems. The enemy abused this forbearance by 
the Islamic State of Afghanistan, and they did not avoid any 
crime against the people throughout this period. Only recently 
they planned to organize an all-out offensive against Kabul. 
The offensive was to be mounted by forces of Hekmatyar's and 
Dostam's militia. It should have taken place at this time. 
Luckily, the Defense Ministry forces of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan foiled this offensive. 
  At the moment, the enemy's major bases--which were their 
heavy weapons bases from where they attacked the city with 
rockets--have been captured. A large section of Kabul City, 
which was abandoned by the residents, has now been liberated. 
We hope that the residents of the city of Kabul, who have been 
rendered refugees and even went to Pakistan, will be able to 
return to their homeland and to reside in their original homes. 
  The operation continued, as you know, until 1700. [words 
indistinct] As a result of the operation a large number of the 
enemy's tanks and heavy weapons have been captured. The number 
of prisoners, as of this moment, is more than 700. A large area 
was liberated, which includes the Ghazi Stadium, Kabul theater, 
Maranjan Hill, and the (?villages) of Qala-e Zaman Khan and 
Deh-e Khodaidad. [words indistinct] [end recording] 
  Tab-e Maranjan was captured [word indistinct] following the 
seizure of Bala Hesar. 
  During the course of an intensive air and land attack that 
was carried out by the forces of the Islamic State, the militia 
has lost the ability for confrontation. The militia's fire 
power was reduced notably in comparison to yesterday. 
  A high-ranking military official of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan estimated the number of prisoners taken during the 
last two days at between 600 to 700; among them are 11 foreign 
nationals. 
  [Words indistinct] received reports saying that the complete 
clearing up of Karta-e Naw and a serious advance toward 
Charasiab [Hekmatyar's headquarters] continues, and the 
Golboddin-Dostam militia forces are fleeing. Another report 
says that a large area behind Tajbeg Hill has been completely 
conquered. [passage omitted] 
  The Golboddin-Dostam militia suffered a heavy defeat in the 
west of Kabul and has escaped. [passage omitted] 
  Mama Habib Modathir [word indistinct] at his command base at 
Darolaman Palace said: The Golboddin-Dostam militia mounted an 
extensive offensive on our positions last night. The militia 
encountered the strong resistance of the Harakat-e Eslami 
mojahedin and were forced to retreat. As a result of the 
gallant resistance of the mojahedin, a large area was retrieved 
from the control of the militia. In this area are: Darolaman 
Palace, Mahmud Tarzi High School, the former building of the 
administration of the Ministry of Defense, the services section 
of Housing Department, Nur Hospital, the office of the deputy 
head of the Construction Department, [word indistinct], 
Sarasiab, Doghabad, Qala-e Muslim, Qala-e Qaderi, Qala-e Abas 
Qoli, and Asiab-e Khoshk. The advance of the jihadi forces and 
mojahedin toward Chilsoton and Rishkhor continues. 
  Modathir added: During the course of the operation, one set 
of BM-1 [not further identified], two tanks, hundreds of light 
weapons, three 83-mm artillery pieces, four medium-sized 
mortars, two rocket launchers, two PK machine guns, two ZK-1 
machine guns, five motor vehicles, and a large quantity of arms 
and ammunition have been captured from the enemy as booty. 
During the course of this successful operation, 40 members of 
the Golboddin-Dostam militia were taken prisoner by the forces 
of the mojahedin, nine of whom were foreign mercenaries. 
  Sardar Mohammad, Abofazl, Mr. Alawi, Sayd Husain Husaini, 
Commander Sofi Safar, Commander Mohammad Anwar (?Sakhra), 
Commander Aziz Ahmad, Commander Sayed Ali Shah, and other 
commanders and mojahedin participated in the operations. 
[passage omitted] 
  It should be said with [word indistinct] that the number of 
losses was very small on the state's side, and observations show 
that the occurrence of minor incidents have been due to the 
carelessness of individuals. [passage omitted] 
  The destruction caused by the battles in Maiwand Wat [main 
street in Kabul] is more terrifying than any other part of 
Kabul. Among the ruins, only a few armed mojahedin could be seen 
loitering. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Report by Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, June 27 (AFP) -- At least 10 people were 
killed or wounded when a jet loyal to the ex-communist Uzbek 
General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam bombed an east Kabul residential 
area early Monday [27 June], witnesses said. 
  The plane dropped between four and six bombs shortly before 
9:00 am (0430 GMT), hitting civilian homes, the witnesses said. 
  "I was sitting down playing cards when suddenly there was a 
huge flash and an explosion," Mohammad Karim told AFP. Karim, 
an ex-military serviceman, who still had blood on his hands from 
digging out the dismembered corpse of one victim, said he 
thought most of the bombs dropped were in the 250-kilogram (550 
pounds) range, but possibly there was one 500-kilogram (1,100 
pound) monster. 
  In one house locals dug with shovels to rescue a man buried 
alive, then turned their attention to another house where two 
children were said to be under the rubble. Hysterical women 
from the bombed houses cried in the street as neighbours were 
packed belongings in taxis to flee the scene. [sentence as 
received] The final casualty toll will not be known until all 
the wreckage has been cleared from the bombed area. 
  The bombing may have been in retaliation for the loss of two 
strategic posts in eastern Kabul at the weekend when forces 
loyal to Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani captured Bala 
Hesar and Maranjan Hill from the coalition alliance of Dostam 
and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. 
  Meanwhile the rival factions in the east of the city 
continued to trade heavy artillery fire all morning.

  [Text] According to reports, fierce fighting continues in 
southeast Afghanistan. A spokesman of Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar has claimed that the combined forces of Hekmatyar and 
General Abdol Rashid Dostam have reoccupied one out of two 
strategic positions in the country's southern region. 
Independent sources, however, have not confirmed this claim. 
The reports say at least 35 people have been killed and 360 
others injured in the latest flare up of fighting. 
  Meanwhile, a meeting of the jehad leaders assessed the 
current situation in Afghanistan. A joint statement issued 
after the meeting calls for an urgent meeting of the Leadership 
Council to decide on the future government as the term of office 
of President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin 
Hekmatyar expires today. Among those who attended the meeting 
include former president Professor Mojadeddi, Shaykh Asef 
Mohseni, Pir Seyyed Ahmad Gilani, and Maulvi Mohammad Nabi 
Mohammadi.

<F P=106> [Report by Terence White] </F>
  [Text] Kabul, June 28 (AFP) -- Kabul was targetted by the 
jets of ex-communist Uzbek General Abdol Rashid Dostam for the 
second successive day Tuesday [28 June], when 12 people were 
killed in a bombing run over the capital's centre, security 
troops reported. 
  "It is hard to estimate the exact number of killed because 
so 
many of the bodies were torn apart in the explosion," explained 
one security guard whose hands were caked in dry blood. 
  Shortly after 8:00 A.M. (0330 GMT) a Russian-made Sukhoy 
Su-22 jet-bomber swept over Kabul and dropped four bombs, one of 
which exploded in the main street outside the Central Post 
Office, killing at least 12 people and wounding several others. 
A doctor working for the French-based aid organisation Medecins 
Sans Frontieres (MSF) which supports the downtown Jamhuriat 
Hospital said only five victims -- with light injuries -- were 
treated after this jet attack. "No operations were necessary. 
All the patients were stabilised and transferred to other 
hospitals for further treatment," the expatriate doctor told AFP. 
  Not far from the CPO a second bomb ripped through the 
ferro-concrete roof of the state gynaecological hospital which 
was deserted except for eight security guards, all of whom 
miraculously escaped unhurt. These guards pointed out a hole at 
the entrance to the neighbouring Institute of Stomatology where 
they said a third bomb was buried unexploded. 
  Local witnesses reported seeing a fourth -- unconfirmed -- 
explosion further east towards Bala Hesar fortress. Bala Hesar 
was captured from the coalition forces of Dostam and his ally 
Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar Saturday [25 June] by troops 
loyal to President Borhanoddin Rabbani. In addition, Rabbani's 
rivals have lost the strategic Maranjan Hill opposite Bala 
Hesar, and Darulaman Palace in south Kabul, prompting 
retaliatory air strikes by Dostam jets. 
  Fighting continues on the eastern city limits but only a 
handful of rockets have been exchanged crashed into the city 
proper. 
  Hekmatyar, who threatened severe military consequences for 
Rabbani if he did not resign the presidency Tuesday [28 June], 
has himself suffered a massive military defeat with the loss of 
Bala Hesar and Maranjan. Observers said although the current 
frontlines reflect recent gains by pro-Rabbani forces, they are 
in fact only a return to the respective positions held by these 
rivals during their first major battle in August 1992. However, 
with the considerable morale and materiel loss inflicted on 
Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami faction and his Uzbek allies, it is 
not unrealistic to expect the jubilant pro-Rabbani forces to 
make more territorial gains.

  [Text] New York, United Nations, June 28, IRNA -- Iranian 
permanent representative to the united nations, Kamal Kharrazi, 
protested against illegal movements of some Iraqi vessels in the 
border river of Arvandrood. 
  In a letter to the United Nations Secretary-General Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali dated 24 June, the representative stressed that the 
Iranian authorities recently observed the "illegal movement of 
some vessels in Arvandrood which were wrongfully and without 
authorization using the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran". 
  Furthermore, the letter added, during recent months, the 
Iranian authorities seized a number of non-Iranian ships 
carrying goods to Iraq through Arvandrood who were either 
carrying Iranian flag without the consent of Iranian authorities 
or were declaring Iranian ports as their final destination. 
  The letter which was issued as a Security Council document, 
continued that "Iran has resorted to limited measures in 
Arvandrood in order to curb these activities which not only 
violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial intergrity but also 
the international sanctions against Iraq." 
  Iran held the Iraqi regime responsible for the consequences 
of its actions which are in violation of international law and 
regulations as well as the principle of good neighbourliness, it 
stressed. 
  The Islamic Republic of Iran, the letter concluded, 
"reaffirming its full compliance with the cease-fire established 
under Security Council Resolution 598 as well as its total 
commitment to the provisions of the treaty concerning the state 
frontier and neighbourly relations of 13 June 1975 and its 
protocols, reiterates its desire for improvement of relations 
with Iraq on the basis of principles of good neighbourliness and 
international law."

  Referring to the Islamic Republic of Iran's readiness to

of a just peace in Tajikistan. 
  Referring to the progress in talks during the past two

<F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Minister, Hope You Are Not </F>
Feeling Weary!"--punctuation as published] 
  [Text] Citing our embassy's diplomats in Bonn after Foreign 
Minister Velayati's meeting with German officials, IRNA reports 
that German national Helmut Szimkus, who spied for Iraq during 
the imposed war and was arrested and sentenced to death, will be 
released soon. 
  It is regrettable to hear this news, which has not been 
refuted. It is also surprising. 
  While German officials are announcing their success in the 
imminent release of their citizen, there is no news or 
information citing an Iranian official on the release of 
innocent Iranian citizen Kazem Darabi, who has been through 60 
contrived sessions of the German court and is in an extremely 
dire physical and psychological condition. 
  Looking at the foreign minister's successful diplomacy in 
Germany in parallel with the outcome of the deputy foreign 
minister's visit to Paris, we can glean everything apart from 
the fate of the innocent, the ordinary Iranian Foreign Ministry 
employee who has been in France's dreadful prisons. The Iranian 
official heard everything and said everything but did not 
express concern over the fate of his oppressed employee. 
  Zeyn ol-'Abedin Sarhaddi, an employee of the Iranian Embassy 
in Switzerland, was arrested in 1991. It is now June 1994! We 
still have no information on the charges brought against him and 
have not seen the documents the French authorities claim to 
have. It is precisely because of the absence of such documents 
and, more importantly, because of the absence of any motivation 
by the relative Iranian authorities that the French authorities 
are keeping Sarhaddi in prison under the worst psychological and 
physical conditions. We hope Iran will throw a morsel of bread 
their way so that they will show some clemency toward Sarhaddi. 
  What have the families and friends of Darabi and Sarhaddi 
done to deserve seeing the release of everyone except their dear 
ones, who continue to be held captive without any hope of 
release? Are these two people suffering for want of friends and 
action? 
  Minister, if you see the Arabs completely ignoring the 
vindication of the rights of Iranian citizens [taken hostage in 
Lebanon], you should at least do your duty toward your own 
ministry's employees. 
  In a recent interview with an afternoon newspaper after 
returning from Cairo, the foreign minister discussed the duties 
of the Foreign Ministry, saying: 
  "... the people definitely do not want the Foreign Ministry 
to just sit around and issue statements." Elsewhere the 
minister asked: "Do we want to betray these people? Do the 
people want the foreign minister and his associates to sit 
around and only make statements about every incident that takes 
place in the world without going to the scene and doing 
something there? The people are not satisfied with such a 
Foreign Ministry. The people want the Foreign Ministry to take 
risks!! and go and work within the framework that has been laid 
down by the system. They want the Foreign Ministry and its 
employees not to be idle ... and, even if our interests are in 
the mouth of the dragon, for us to put our hand in and pull out 
our interests." 
  You can keep the risk and the dragon! Much has been said 
about the people's rights. We expect nothing from Mitterrand, 
who is now very busy with human rights issues in Bosnia and in 
Rwanda. But be assured that your forgotten employees are not at 
rest. At least issue a statement about them. This is the least 
the people expect! 
  Was it not recently that two Iranian citizens were arrested 
in Paris--again on false accusations--and Paris was preparing 
the price of a transaction when public opinion and the press 
were sensitized and criticized this well-known method of 
policing by France, thus forcing them to respect our country's 
public opinion and to release these two innocent people? Was it 
not recently that the Germans demanded that Iran use its 
influence with the Hammadi family so that the two hostages they 
were keeping would be released? And did Iran not do so? Was a 
promise not given to Iran and the Hammadi family that he would 
be released immediately? Why did this not happen? Did the 
esteemed president not complain about the Western press during 
his recent news conference and say that for the release of the 
American hostages in Lebanon, the Iranian hostages being kept by 
the Zionist regime in Lebanon have been cast into oblivion? How 
many times must we experience the saying "Once bitten twice shy?" 
  If, as claimed, public opinion on both sides is necessary to 
consolidate bilateral relations, the just rights of the citizens 
of the two sides concerned should also be considered. There 
should be mutual understanding between the people on both sides, 
who should definitely be regarded as equal! Why is this not 
happening? 
  Why is it that everyone else always supports their citizens 
rights--even if these rights are illegitimate and unfair--while 
we do not? Some even believe that our citizens' rights disturb 
the success of our domestic and foreign diplomacy and yet we 
must listen to their babblings about human rights all the time. 
  Here is the ball and the field. Here is the risk and the 
dragon. But concluding, and for the foreign minister's 
information as well as to remind him, we would like to recall 
the everlasting words of the imam, may his soul be sanctified: 
"Defending Islam and Hizballah is an indisputable principle of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran."

  [Text] Tehran, June 26, IRNA -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Sunday [26 June] lashed out at certain 
countries pretending to advocate human rights and condemned 
their support for the terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization 
(MKO). 
  "These countries through extensive financial, propaganda and 
political backing support a grouplet which is involved in the 
bomb blast at the holy shrine of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon 
him]," the president said addressing the inaugural session of 
the nationwide seminar on "judicairy week." 
  "Such countries provide the MKO with money, radio station, 
office and diplomatic passports and support the manifestation of 
terrorism and also open their gates to them," noted Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Rafsanjani. 
  The seminar is held annually to commemorate martyr Beheshti, 
the first chief justice in the post-revolution, who was 
assassinated by the MKO terrorists. 
  The president stressed: "We attach no importance to those 
countries and place no hope in them. However, we can offer the 
world the best type of human rights based on Islam and Islamic 
laws." 
  Referring to the progress made in the country, the president 
stressed that the enemies are not totally disappointed and would 
resort to vicious acts such as bomb blast at the holy shrine 
which could please no obstinate individual. 
  "We know our enemies and understand that the hostility and 
grudge they have harbored against the revolution is not because 
of individuals. They are scared of the Islamic movement and of 
the final triumph of Islam," he noted. 
  He called on all people to preserve their vigilance in all 
dimensions, adding that they should also be prepared to face 
more vicious propaganda because the enemies increase their 
brutal acts as the country progresses. 
  Praising the martyrs of the Islamic republic, especially 
martyr Beheshti, the president said that some 13 years ago when 
masterminds behind the bombing of the Islamic republic party's 
headquarters were hatching the plot, they were vainly thinking 
that through the bombing the Islamic republic would collapse and 
the way would be paved for the establishment of the type of 
government they were seeking for. 
  The president pointed to the achievements of the country in 
many fields and said that the Islamic system, by passing through 
"arduous defiles" has now reached a path rather easier to pass. 
  Chief justice Mohammad Yazdi, Justice Minister Hojjat 
ol-Eslam Shushtari and judges from throughout the country were 
present at the gathering.

  [Excerpt] The Islamic Consultative Assembly [Majles] 
deputies, in a statement today during an open session, condemned 
the bestial act of the monafeqin [Mojahedin-e Khalq 
Organization, MKO] in violating Muslim sanctities and bathing in 
blood the innocent pilgrims to the immaculate grave of His 
Holiness Imam Reza, peace be upon him. In their statement, the 
Majles deputies, criticizing the silence of international forums 
regarding that atrocity, call upon world parliaments to condemn 
the perpetrators of the crime, especially America. The 
statement stressed the need for swift identification and 
punishment of the crime's perptrators. 
  According to a report by our parliamentary correspondent, 
Majles speaker Nateq-Nuri considered the monafeqin's crime on 
the day of Ashura at the immaculate shrine of the Eighth Imam to 
stem from their despair and hopelessness regarding their future. 
He pointed out: Such incidents make our nation and government 
more united and determined in the fight with world arrogance and 
its mercenaries. 
  The Majles speaker stressed: The crime in Mashhad does not 
only belong to the monafeqin; they are not the only ones to be 
condemned. They are tools in the hands of world arrogance and 
all governments that somehow support the process of creating 
discord. The monafeqin are involved in that atrocity. 
  Criticizing the untrue statements made by Western 
authorities 
concerning the fight against terrorism, he added: Until the 
special UN committee for human rights and its representatives, 
including Galindo Pohl, make the Mashhad atrocity the axis of 
their investigation, we shall have no confidence in them.

  [Excerpts] During a speech at a meeting this morning with 
judiciary officials and judges from all over the country, His 
Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the great leader of the Islamic 
revolution, stressed the importance of discipline and stability 
in the judiciary. [passage omitted] 
  Criticizing those organizations that advocate human rights, 
His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i said: Those who burned alive 
dozens of people last year and followed an overt racist policy 
in their countries do not have the right to utter the words 
human rights from their filthy mouths and expect the observance 
of human rights from others. 
  The leader of the Islamic revolution admonished the world 
forums and committees that advocate human rights for their 
silence regarding one of the greatest terrorist tragedies. He 
said: Those so-called human rights committees and forums, which 
have brought politics into everything, have turned a blind eye 
to that great terrorist tragedy at the shrine of Imam 
Reza--peace be upon him--and have not said a word about it. 
Those who are constantly saying that the greatest threat to the 
world today is terrorism have kept silent about the 'Ashura 
tragedy in Mashhad. Therefore, what right do they have to 
meddle in matters relating to the observance of human rights in 
other countries. [passage omitted]

  [Text] In his sermons today, Ayatollah Emami-Kashani, the 
acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran, set out to analyze the 
characteristics of the hypocritical elements responsible for the 
bomb blast in the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him. 
  He said: This savage act was in fact a declaration of war 
against Islam, and those who have no respect whatsoever for the 
status of the family of the prophet undoubtedly adhere to no 
doctrine or school of thought. 
  The acting Friday prayer leader of Tehran added: The 
perpetrators of such acts should know that such crimes will lead 
to nothing but the further consolidation of the revolution's 
foundations. Moreover, such acts draw the attention of Muslims 
and the followers of other divine religions to the scared 
notions of Islam. 
  Ayatollah Emami-Kashani described the terrorist actions of 
the Monafeqin throughout the history of the Islamic revolution. 
He then commemorated the martyrs of 7 Tir [bomb blast in 
Islamic Republic Party on 28 June 1981], of Mashhad'a 'Ashura 
[bomb blast on 20 June 1994], and the other martyrs of the 
revolution. He said: The recent act by the Monafeqin was 
condemned in many countries. However, mere condemnation of these 
savage acts, by Islamic communities and Shiite and Sunni 
scholars is not enough, and the Islamic world has a duty to 
react against such crimes.

  [Text] Tehran, June 24, IRNA -- Provisional leader of the 
Friday congregational prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Mohammad 
Emami-Kashani, here today termed the bomb blast at the mausoleum 
of Imam Reza (as) [peace be upon him] in Mashhad on Monday [20 
June] "a criminal act" and "a war against Islam." 
  "If the house of Ka'ba or the mausoleum of prophet (pbuh) 
[peace be upon him] were in Iran, the criminals would not 
hesitate to commit such crimes against those holy places as 
well," Ayatollah Kashani told the congregation of worshippers 
gathered at Tehran University campus. The provisional leader of 
the Friday congregational prayers underlined that many 
traditions exist about the prophet's blessed household 
(ahlulbeit) which stipulate that those who are hostile towards 
the prophet's household, are not following any of the Islamic 
sects. He said that those who committed this crime were in 
complete darkness and that they were incapable of having any 
human feeling. 
  Ayatollah Kashani went on to add that the emergence of the 
Islamic resurgence in the world could explain why such acts of 
terror were committed against Islam and Muslims. 
  Referring to the enemies of worldwide Islamic movement, he 
said that "they had also shown their unhappiness with Islam 
through explosions and acts of terrorism that they committed 
prior to this last incident, (and now) they are hiring those who 
are mentally and emotionally slaves and those who are poor in 
spirit." 
  Ayatollah Kashani added that the more horrible the crime, 
the 
more effect it will have on helping the growth of political 
consciousness of the people. "The more horrendous the crime, 
the more the people's growth and falsehood will gain nothing but 
misery," he said. 
  He then addressed the Muslim nations, asking them to condemn 
this crime. "This tragedy is an insult to the divinely 
sanctified areas. this is a terrorist conspiracy to destabilize 
the (Muslim) countries. Not only Iran, but also the whole 
Muslim world, should condemn this horrifying crime," he said. 
  Ayatollah Kashani then invited both Christians and Jews, 
respectfully known in Islam as the people of the book, to 
condemn this crime. "Of course the Islamic institutions, both 
Sunni and Shia, have condemned this crime and this is not 
sufficient. The whole Muslim world and also the people of the 
book should come out and condemn this act." 
  He also lambasted the world bodies for keeping mum on this 
crime. "The world bodies that always make hue and cry over human 
rights should ask themselves why the paid mercenaries of the 
world arrogance have committed such a terrible crime," he added.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Hoseyn Shari'atmadari: "A Word With the </F>
Orator"] 
  [Text] In this commentary we do not want to discuss the 
unjustified imports of American goods into Islamic Iran or 
whether they should or should not be imported, because we 
discussed this issue following Majles Speaker Nateq-Nuri's 
remarks on 28 May, and stated that our firm belief is that 
allowing the importation of American goods is, first, an insult 
to the noble and Muslim Iranian nation and to all those who gave 
their lives to free our homeland from American domination. 
  Second, it turns us into a toy in the hands of American 
plundering murderers who, because of the fact that Islam rules 
in Iran--and only because of this--are, in addition to their 
numerous hostilities, overtly preventing the export of advanced 
technology to this Islamic country and are also threatening and 
intimidating the other industrial countries to prevent them from 
doing so. But at the same time they are trying--very 
magnanimously!--to find a way into our unfortunately weak 
markets by exporting various brands of American cigarettes, soft 
drinks, candy, chewing gum, chips, lollipops, and other 
unnecessary items. 
  Third, the sacred system of the Islamic Republic is 
considered to be the standard-bearer in the fight against the 
world hegemonists. And in the full-fledged campaign that has 
recently been carried out in various parts of the world of Islam 
against the aggressors headed by America, the deprived and 
oppressed nations follow the pattern of victorious resistance by 
the Islamic Iranian nation in their sacred jihad. Thus, the 
importation of American products only helps to mar this sacred 
pattern. 
  We believe that, for America, this part of the charade which 
it has started is more important than the other parts, in the 
sense that on the one hand it prevents the exporting of advanced 
technology from the industrial world to Iran, thus slowing down 
the progress of this Islamic country and, on the other, by 
exporting chewing gum, cigarettes, candy, lollipops, chips, and 
other such items, it puts up the false "representational sign" 
in our Islamic country. But even though this "sign" is false, 
other nations who have turned their eyes to Islamic Iran in 
their anti-American struggles are starting to doubt whether they 
should "tread" the same path that our Muslim people have taken. 
We believe that the boycotting of American products by the late 
imam, may his soul be sanctified, was meant, first and foremost, 
to maintain the dividing line that separates us from America and 
to state to the world of Islam that the enmity that the great 
satan has toward Islam, the Muslims, and the deprived people 
will never be forgotten in history. 
  We can go on and on in discussing this topic. But in this 
commentary we want to discuss another issue. And that is that 
in his news conference with domestic and foreign 
correspondents--the text of which was carried by the Vision of 
the Islamic Republic of Iran--esteemed President Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a question 
put to him by a KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on why some of the 
esteemed officials of the system are not very keen on being 
interviewed by domestic correspondents: "This should not be so. 
All the ministers are ready to give the necessary explanations, 
each in his own sector." This is very encouraging and will help 
to clarify the ambiguities spread by our enemies about the 
policies of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic and of its 
caring officials in the same way that the esteemed president's 
news conference played an outstanding and effective role to this 
effect. 
  But in another part of his news conference, Hojjat ol-Eslam 
val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani stated in answer to a KEYHAN 
correspondent that some American goods should be imported for 
some of the country's industrial needs, such as spare parts for 
factories and aircraft which have been mostly manufactured in 
the United States; and then he asked the KEYHAN correspondent: 
"Are you suggesting that we should stop all this?" And when 
the KEYHAN correspondent explained that he was speaking 
metaphorically and referring to products such as Coca Cola, 
which is a good example of an unnecessary commodity--as a symbol 
of foreign presence--the esteemed president stated: "In my 
opinion, that symbolism is somewhat common." 
  In view of the outstanding Islamic and revolutionary 
personality of the esteemed president, who was one of the 
backbones of the revolution and one of the closest and most 
devoted and committed companions of his eminence the imam, may 
his soul be sanctified, and of the leader of the revolution, we 
consider it our duty to refer to the question by the KEYHAN 
correspondent, whose remarks were left incomplete in the recent 
news conference, and to point out that the reason why Coca Cola 
was cited as an example of an unnecessary item is that 
unfortunately without any justification, an extensive 
advertising campaign is continuing in our markets with posters 
on city walls for unnecessary items such as American cigarettes 
and so on. And while we do not believe that looking at American 
products from this angle is a "common" issue, we firmly believe 
that had the esteemed president paid closer attention to what 
our correspondent meant with his question, he would have agreed 
with our point of view, since in his news conference the topic 
of vigilance and alertness toward American ploys were clearly 
visible. 
  Another point is that in view of Hojjat ol-Eslam val 
Moslemin 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani's remarks in answer to the question put to 
him by the KEYHAN-E HAVA'I correspondent on the need for the 
esteemed ministers and officials of the Islamic system to speak 
with the press in order to clarify ambiguities, it is feared 
that in justifying their lack of attention to some questions by 
the correspondents, the esteemed officials will avoid answering 
by alleging that these questions are "common!"

  [Text] More than 754,000 tonnes of goods, valued at $538 
million have been exported during the first two months of the 
current year [year beginning 21 March]. Despite a reduction in 
weight compared with a similar period last year, the value of 
the exports shows an increase of over 4 percent. 
  The deputy for the Trade Ministry and the director general 
of 
the center for the expansion of exports, in an interview with 
correspondents today, also added: Non-oil exports last year 
[year beginning 21 March 1993] were valued at more than $3.8 
billion. It is forecast that in the current year that figure 
will rise to over $6 billion through increased state export 
capability. 
  Trade ministry deputy Mr Sa'idlu added: Current exports by 
the Islamic Republic of Iran to Islamic countries increased 
ten-fold compared with those before the revolution. Imports 
from those countries also rose from $380 million to $3.2 billion. 
  The director general of Iran's center for expansion of 
exports said: The Fifth Islamic Trade Fair will be held in 
Tehran beginning 25 Tir [16 July] with the participation of 
Islamic states and the cooperation of the Islamic Conference 
Organization for the purpose of expanding cooperation and the 
axis of unity, fraternity, and trade.

  [Text] The amphibious Zafar-1 joint military exercise, 
which started in Persian Gulf waters and the strategic Strait of 
Hormoz on 30 Khordad [20 June], was concluded successfully today. 
  Light and heavy vessels, fast assault boats, rangers, and 
commandoes of the Armed Forces and the Islamic Revolution Guard 
Corps, and a number of fighter-bombers of the Islamic Republic 
Air Force took part in the exercise. 
  Operations were carried out in six phases, involving the 
control of communication routes and navy equipment; dispatching 
units of light vessels; air and surface bombardment of 
communication routes, vital positions, and installations of an 
imaginary enemy; reconnaissance and mine-sweeping operations by 
special teams; and capturing the positions and sea rescue 
operations of the vessels of the imaginary enemy. 
  The Zafar-1 maneuver is one of a series of joint annual 
exercises of the Armed Forces and the Guards Corps, aimed at 
raising defensive capabilities and exchanging experience and 
military know-how.

  [Text] Beirut, 27 Jun (MENA)--Egyptian Foreign Minister 
'Amr Musa has stated that the comprehensive peace in which Egypt 
believes must be based on Israel's withdrawal from all the 
territories it occupied in 1967, self-determination for the 
Palestinian people, and an agreement on an overall settlement 
that could ensure security, withdrawal, and coexistence among 
the region's peoples. 
  In an interview with the Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR 
published today, Musa said that progress on any of the 
Arab-Israeli peace tracks will help the other tracks in the same 
way as failure on any track will harm the others. He added that 
progress on the Palestinian-Israeli track was followed by 
progress on the Jordanian track, noting that negotiations on the 
Palestinian track were in parallel with endeavors and talks 
along the Syrian track. He noted that U.S. Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher has visited the region more than once to 
boost the Syrian-Israeli track. He stressed that Egypt believes 
the Syrian-Israeli track is the main track that could prove 
crucial to the fate of the comprehensive peace or the Middle 
East problem. 
  Musa pointed out that we believe in basic principles, 
namely, 
that Syria is entitled to regain the Golan according to the 4 
June 1967 borders, which would necessitate an Israeli military 
and civilian withdrawal up to these borders. He added that 
Egypt is closely following the contacts being held in connection 
with the Arab-Israeli talks. He emphasized that the 
Syrian-Israeli track is of particular importance to Egypt, 
because what is in the interest of the Syrian brothers is in 
Egypt's interest and because no comprehensive peace can be 
achieved without Israel's withdrawal from the Golan. The 
foreign minister hoped that progress would be achieved along 
this track in the coming stage. 
  Regarding the Palestinian issue, Musa said that what is 
required now is to move from Gaza and Jericho to the remaining 
occupied territories and then hold negotiations for a final 
solution. He warned against one-upmanship in the Palestinian 
arena. He added: Inter-Palestinian collision or one-upmanship 
over political movement are not needed; the important thing is 
to gear the Palestinian issue toward serving its 
goals--self-determination for the Palestinian people. 
  On the developments in Yemen, the Egyptian foreign minister 
warned that if the current fighting continues, expectations are 
that things will be "extremely bad." The continuation of this 
war, the ongoing killing, and the victims resulting from this 
war cannot preserve any unity or serve as a basis for the future 
of a state or a people, he added. If the current UN contacts 
fail, the international as well as the Arab legality will not 
remain silent about the continuation of this war; Yemen's 
survival and future are now at stake, he added. Musa ruled out 
any Arab or foreign military intervention to end the 
deteriorating conditions in Yemen.

  [Text] Cairo, June 27 (AFP) -- The US navy recently 
discovered two Egyptian ships in the Red Sea carrying Saudi 
weapons to south Yemen, an Egyptian journalist has charged. 
Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal said in a lecture at Cairo University: 
"The US navy in the Red Sea recently intercepted and 
requisitioned two Egyptian boats transporting Saudi arms to 
south Yemen." 
  AFP obtained Monday [27 June] a copy of Haykal's lecture, 
given Wednesday 22 June]. But the US naval command centre based 
in Florida, covering the Middle East, told AFP they were unaware 
of any incident and had not received any internal report on the 
matter. Haykal was close to former Egyptian President Jamal 
'Abd al-Nasir, and has many Arab and western contacts. 
  An Egyptian source, who asked not to be named, said he could 
not confirm or deny the claim. "Egypt's position in principle is 
not to contribute to any effort to supply arms to either of the 
Yemeni parties," he said. 
  Opposition newspaper AL-'ARABI said Monday the two boats 
intercepted by the US navy returned to Egypt with their cargo. 
  Egypt's President Husni Mubarak recently criticised northern 
Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih for his "insistence" on 
trying to maintain unity, saying it could not be achieved by 
force. But Cairo has not recognised the breakaway Yemen 
Democratic Republic, declared by the south on May 21. 
  War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his 
southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR says the leaders of 
Yemen have become the Serbian leaders' primary competitors for 
record cease-fire announcements that only end in more vicious 
fighting. 
  But the Yemeni leaders stand out for using the daily 
cease-fire violations to kill as many of their own innocent 
civilians as possible and to destroy the facilities and 
installations for which the Yemeni people have paid huge amounts 
of money, the paper says in its editorial today. 
  It says the arrogant and intransigent positions of some 
Yemeni leaders and their rejection of any Arab mediation will 
not solve the problem. Indeed they will make things worse, 
deepen the wounds, and make it more difficult--if not 
impossible--for things to return to normal. 
  AL-AKHBAR notes extensive Arab diplomatic activity to end 
the 
conflict and asks why the Sanaa government is sending envoys at 
the same time as it rejects Arab mediation as interference in 
its internal affairs. 
  The paper expresses the fear that the Yemeni crisis may be 
internationalized given that some non-Arab quarters are 
exploiting it. This will only make things worse, it says.

<F P=106> [Interviews with Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Ma'mun </F>
al-Hudaybi and Hilmi Murad, deputy leader of the Socialist Labor 
Party [SLP], answering identical sets of questions by 
correspondent Muhammad Raghib, published in AL-WAFD's "Political 
Week" section; places and dates of interviews not given] 
  [Text] [Raghib] You joined the SLP in raising the slogan 
"Islam is the solution" during the 1987 People's Assembly 
election campaign. Was this an ideological or merely political 
alliance? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] We first raised the slogan "Islam is the 
solution" during the 1984 election, which some Muslim 
Brotherhood members contested. Since then we have committed 
ourselves to this slogan as a concise declaration of the basic 
principle or ideology in which we believe. As for the alliance 
involving the Brotherhood, the SLP, and the Liberal Party in the 
1987 election, we all raised the same slogan and formulated a 
platform of 10 basic points, which were more elaborately 
explained in leaflets later. The SLP, the Liberal Party, and 
the Brotherhood contested the election as a triple alliance and 
on the basis of the platform just mentioned. We raised the 
slogan "Islam is the solution." From this you can see that our 
alliance with the SLP was both ideological and political. In 
our Islamic faith there is no distinction between religion and 
politics. Islam is both a religion and a state. 
  [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still 
exist 
or has it been dissolved? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The Brotherhood is still allied with the SLP. 
We are working, coordinating, and consulting with them. 
Brotherhood members feel that the SLP's commitment to the 
alliance continues. We welcome the alliance because it is 
actually a form of dialogue, consultation, and exchange of views 
over various political, economic, and social issues of interest 
to the public. The dialogue depends on circumstances and the 
needs of the parties. It is not limited to specific dates or 
times. 
  [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating 
within 
the SLP rank and file. How true is this? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] This is a point we always stress; the 
Brotherhood has its own independent organization and has never 
joined the organizations of other political parties except in 
extraordinary circumstances. I will not speak of these now. At 
the same time the SLP has its own structures and organizations 
as a political party. It is not my business to discuss them 
here. I have already explained that we and the SLP have an 
alliance that we seek to preserve. We are joined under one 
banner--"Islam is the solution." 
  [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before 
the 
[1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with 
the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements. 
What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood 
relationship today? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] "Young Egypt's" relations with the Brotherhood 
in those days fluctuated between extreme closeness and extreme 
disagreement. This issue belongs to history. Current 
political, economic, and social conditions are very different. 
This change in circumstances has been fundamental and many of 
the SLP and our own positions have changed. The saying has it 
that everything happens in its own good time. 
  [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection 
with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National 
Dialogue Congress. What was the result? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] The SLP never intended to represent the 
Brotherhood or speak on its behalf at the National Dialogue 
Congress. SLP leader Ibrahim Shukri made this clear during an 
interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM. He said: "The SLP will 
never represent the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood has the right 
to have its own representatives." 
  The Brotherhood has its own status and can represent itself 
anywhere anytime. But we welcome any consultations or meetings 
with the SLP. I must make it clear that it is out of the 
question for the SLP to represent the Brotherhood at the 
National Dialogue Congress or any other forum. 
  [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance 
between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary 
election? 
  [Al-Hudaybi] No one knows what form the next election will 
take. We have heard rumors that it will be held in accordance 
with the list system. Then we heard denials. We also heard 
that it would adopt a mixed list-and-independent-candidate 
system. When the election draws near things will become 
clearer. Then the existing security, political, and economic 
conditions can be evaluated. We can decide then whether we want 
to coordinate or forge an alliance with the SLP or do something 
else. Likewise the SLP can decide on these issues. It is 
difficult for Brotherhood and SLP leaders to make decisions on 
this affair right now. 
  [Raghib] You joined the Muslim Brotherhood in raising the 
slogan "Islam is the solution" during the 1987 People's Assembly 
election campaign. Was this an ideological or merely political 
alliance? 
  [Murad] Our alliance with the Brotherhood is merely 
political 
and its purpose was to participate jointly in the election 
battle. But this alliance continued--it still does--even after 
joint participation in the election to the People's Assembly 
ended. This does not mean the programs of the SLP and the 
Brotherhood are identical. The alliance is based on specific 
published points but the detailed programs of the SLP and the 
Brotherhood are not identical. Otherwise the agreement would 
had been a merger, not an alliance, which would have required a 
word-for-word and detailed agreement on every aspect of the 
practical application of the two sides' views and their 
understanding of the application of Islamic teaching in every 
aspect of life. We cannot say this exists or has been achieved. 
Thus it becomes clear that our alliance with the Brotherhood 
is, as I said, political, not ideological. 
  [Raghib] Does the SLP-Muslim Brotherhood alliance still 
exist 
or has it been dissolved? 
  [Murad] Nothing has happened to warrant dissolving the 
alliance with the Brotherhood, that is, nothing has happened to 
our respect for the clauses of our political accord with the 
Brotherhood to warrant such action. Thus the alliance between 
the SLP and the Brotherhood still exists, but on the basis of 
political cooperation only. This alliance is proceeding within 
the framework of the points of the declared alliance; the SLP's 
internal affairs are not bound by it. As long as no 
disagreements occur over the application of any of the 
agreement's clauses, as long as there are no clashes over 
declared public stances, and as long as the stances do not 
change, then the alliance as I described it still exists. 
  [Raghib] A Brotherhood faction is reportedly operating 
within 
the SLP rank and file. How true is this? 
  [Murad] This allegation is made for a malicious purpose, 
which seeks to claim that there is a full merger between the SLP 
and the Brotherhood. The truth of the issue is that each one of 
us is keen to respect the independent identity of the other. As 
proof of this, when Brotherhood candidates won in the 1987 
election on the SLP list they had the right to attend the SLP's 
higher committee meetings in their capacity as members of the 
SLP's parliamentary caucus. But they did not attend these 
meetings so as not to create any ambiguity. They restricted 
themselves to attending the parliamentary caucus meetings in the 
People's Assembly. We have no thought of including Brotherhood 
members in the SLP's organizations. Both parties have their own 
political views and the desire to maintain independence. No 
party should be responsible for the other party's behavior. 
  [Raghib] The society "Young Egypt," which operated before 
the 
[1952] revolution and later became the SLP, had relations with 
the Brotherhood, which involved agreements and disagreements. 
What are the parameters of the SLP and the Brotherhood 
relationship today? 
  [Murad] The SLP and the Brotherhood were bound together by 
the Islamic tendency and the belief that abiding by correct 
Islamic teaching would achieve whatever is best for Egypt and 
all its sects. It is the same tendency now. Occasional 
disagreements or the absence of an identity of views and 
policies do not spoil the general trend and do not justify 
clashes or divisions in the circumstances. The same situation 
existed before the revolution between "Young Egypt" and the 
Brotherhood and fierce clashes took place between the two as a 
result of their different attitudes and ideas. But such 
disagreements--today and in the past--are not so grave or vital 
as to lead to hostility and clashes. 
  [Raghib] A few months ago there was an uproar in connection 
with the SLP's plan to represent the Brotherhood at the National 
Dialogue Congress. What was the result? 
  [Murad] It was never said that the SLP could represent the 
"Brotherhood." It is known that both the SLP and the 
Brotherhood have their own independence and political identity. 
To avoid official objection to the Brotherhood being 
represented in the dialogue as a recognized group, the SLP 
proposed letting this trend be represented by "Muslim Brothers" 
in their capacity as public figures who have their own views and 
ideas about society. It was merely a suggestion aimed at 
removing the embarrassment in which the various parties found 
themselves. There was a misunderstanding of the aims behind the 
SLP's proposal. There was no indication that the SLP intended 
to represent the Brotherhood. 
  [Raghib] Will there be some form of coordination or alliance 
between the SLP and the Brotherhood in the next parliamentary 
election? 
  [Murad] We have not discussed this before, neither inside 
the 
SLP nor with the Brotherhood. It is too early for that. There 
must first be an understanding on fighting the next election 
before the issue of coordination and alliance is studied, 
because it is known that the opposition parties -- with the 
exception of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party -- 
and the Brotherhood boycotted the last election. The issue 
depends on ensuring the honesty of the election so that 
participation will be serious. If this does happen then we are 
open to the possibility of coordination and an alliance with the 
Brotherhood if they ask for it. We might also ask them to do so 
if we believe that coordination and an alliance with them will 
serve the national interest and public objectives. This applies 
to any other political party, not just the Brotherhood.

<F P=106> [Interview with Muslim Brotherhood leader Hamid Abu-al-Nasr </F>
by Sha'ban 'Abd-al-Rahman; place and date not given] 
  [Text] ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you assess all the recent 
intense talk about the Muslim Brotherhood [MB] and are there 
certain reasons or background to that talk? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] What has been or being said about the 
Brotherhood is assessed according to the parties involved. Such 
parties include the security authorities, government-run 
newspapers, the official media, and a number of people with 
leftist and secular inclinations, although their popular effect 
is less than limited. But perhaps the opportunity for publicity 
given to them through various media made them look different 
from their real weight and size and made them look more 
vociferous. Their status is known because their stance on Islam 
is known. 
  Speaking about security authorities, everyone recalls the 
interior minister's statement a few days ago that the Muslim 
Brothers are preachers and have nothing to do with terrorism. 
But shortly afterward he said that the Muslim Brothers support 
terrorism. This statement came after the president's interview 
with the German newspaper DER SPIEGEL, in which he said that the 
Muslim Brothers were behind terrorism, which was followed with a 
propaganda campaign by the government-run newspapers depicting 
the Muslim Brothers as a terrorist group that supports terrorism 
and forms clandestine organizations. The campaign also 
indicated that a funds secretary of one of the trade unions had 
provided terrorism with a quarter of a million pounds. This was 
stated by a person whom the security authorities presented on a 
television program. 
  This series of events and developments suggests a great 
deal, 
especially if we remember that senior official circles stated 
some time ago that the Muslim brothers followed a democratic 
course in the country's political activity. 
  There have been varying explanations for the situation. Some 
suggested that this was a campaign to stem the Islamic upsurge 
by restricting the preachers and barring them from preaching for 
the cause of Almighty God by giving advice, barring them from 
seeking unity based on love and brotherhood and from reviving 
the spirit in a religious context and raising it on pride, 
dignity, and sacrifice. Other explanations suggested that the 
official stand escalated after the crisis that emerged between 
the Lawyers Association [LA] and the state authorities following 
the death of lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani and that this 
situation has spread to cover all the trade unions. Others have 
another explanation. They say that with the preparation for the 
[national] dialogue and the exclusion of the Muslim Brothers, 
the situation required a justification for this exclusion and 
for preparing the way to rally the participants in the dialogue 
against the Islamic trend. 
  Other explanations cite fears and expectations by officials 
based on the vision of some circles, saying that the Muslim 
Brothers are seeking to take power and that they are close to 
this goal and hence a measure of confrontation is necessary. 
Other explanations refer to the Gaza-Jericho Accord and the 
Muslim Brothers' stand on it. Meanwhile, some opposition 
newspapers reported that there had been U.S. memoranda warning 
against the Islamic upsurge and saying that the Muslim Brothers 
were close to taking power. 
  Still others said that the People's Assembly elections are 
approaching and it is necessary to prevent the continuation of 
the alliance among the Muslim Brothers and to prevent this 
alliance from taking part in these elections. 
  Despite all this, the Muslim Brothers stress two points. 
First, they are preachers and not seekers of power and all they 
aim for is God's retribution. Second, their stands on various 
issues are based on principles derived from God's Book and His 
Prophet's traditions, and that there is no vagary, whim, or 
private interest behind defining a view or stance. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] Relations between the government and the 
Brotherhood in the past were calm. So what made them erupt in 
this way? Could the Lawyers Association [LA] incidents be the 
sole cause? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] We have said that there are several 
explanations propounded by a number of parties. Though the LA 
incidents could have caused the eruption, as has been observed, 
we do not believe that they were the sole cause. We have 
referred to a number of explanations for the tense situation as 
given by some people. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] Talking about the LA, what is the 
relationship between the Brotherhood, as a group, and the 
professional associations and the Brotherhood members in their 
councils? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] The Brotherhood has no ties with the 
associations. The latter have their own elected councils and 
they include thousands of the cream of this country's sons who 
have the brains, intellect, knowledge, awareness, and expertise 
to manage the country's affairs independently. They realize and 
are aware of the gravity of their professional and national 
duties. That is how the associations are and everybody knows 
about their affairs and conditions. Members of these 
associations' councils who belong to the Islamic tendency have 
undertaken their responsibilities or been tasked with them 
through elections which they fought as citizens who have the 
right to do so. They are doing their job and fulfilling their 
duties through the associations' councils and within the 
associations' framework and not through the Brotherhood. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] What is your response to the terms of 
seizure, control, and occupation of the associations which the 
media are using against the Brotherhood? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] Control, onslaught, occupation, and illegal 
seizure of the associations are not concepts but expressions of 
impotence, bankruptcy, and evasiveness which this or that party 
are using. Members of the associations are depicted as being so 
naive as to allow opportunities for their associations to be 
seized or their affairs to be pounced upon while remaining 
oblivious to all this. 
  The Brotherhood has not entered the associations through the 
window or infiltrated them during the night. It has not changed 
the ballot boxes or cards or massed the security forces or the 
militias to suppress the associations' members and impose its 
own councils on them. Muslim Brothers entered as candidates in 
free and honest elections that were under the full supervision 
of the judiciary. The members voted freely and safely without 
rigging or pressure. They sided with those who derive their 
principles from God's Book and His Prophet's teachings. 
  I believe that it is the believers' right to ask: Why 
shouldn't free and fair elections be the arena for the honest 
confrontation? Why are the Muslim Brothers accused of illegal 
seizure when they have won through clean ballots and under the 
supervision of the unbiased judiciary? Why are the others loath 
to admit what is right and factual and then resort to 
propagating false claims? Is it not ridiculous, for example, to 
say that the Brotherhood has seized control of the LA even 
though extremely honest elections were held under judiciary 
supervision led by a Coptic brother counselor? 
  These are claims of bankruptcy or avoidance of reality but 
they do not deceive the noble Egyptian people and do not affect 
the awareness or determination of the associations' members. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] So what has happened to change the 
situation 
and make President Mubarak and the government media describe you 
all of a sudden as being behind terrorism and say that you are 
managing the associations from the Brotherhood's guidance office? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] Following the LA's incidents, one of the 
government's papers said that the Brotherhood is managing the LA 
from its guidance office. It presented conflicting and tenuous 
justifications for this claim. It wrote that the Brotherhood 
exploited the death of Lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to instigate 
the LA incidents and create troubles that would embarrass the 
authorities. It also said that al-Madani belonged to terrorist 
organizations and therefore the Brotherhood exploited his case 
and this proved there was a link between the Brotherhood and 
terrorism. The same paper then said that the Brotherhood 
instigated the LA incidents in order to gain popularity that 
would ensure the success of its candidates in the coming 
elections. All these are flimsy excuses whose main objective is 
to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism. But these claims are 
contradictory and farcical and this shows just how false they 
are. Yet the responsible and media quarters used them to launch 
a campaign against the Brotherhood and to level accusations 
against the Muslim Brothers. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] Exactly what effect is this campaign 
against you having on your proselytizing, the way you 
proselytize, your participation in Egypt's political life, 
social activities, and your dealings with the government and the 
authorities in general? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] We are preaching for God Almighty with the 
right words and good example. Proselytizing is the duty of 
every Muslim and is not an easy road or one strewn with roses. 
It is a call for love, brotherhood, cordiality, sympathy, work, 
sacrifice, pride, might, and independence. Those preaching 
God's word are continuing along their road and course and are 
seeking only God's blessing and mercy. If someone follows this 
course and has this as his objective, then what can impede him 
from doing his duty and job? 
  We are participating and will participate in the political 
life through all legitimate ways and means. We will do so 
tomorrow as we did in the past. We will deal with people the 
way God's preachers deal with everybody. We are seeking only 
what is good for Egypt and its people, both rulers and ruled. 
We pray to God to guide everybody toward working according to 
His Book and His Prophet's teachings and to strengthen the ties 
of love among Egypt's sons. 
  The Muslim Brothers condemn terrorism, fight terrorism, and 
are subjected to it when their freedoms are confiscated and 
their proselytizers are pursued, imprisoned, detained, or hanged. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] What effects is this campaign against you 
having on your stand on terrorism and the mutual killings 
between the authorities and some Islamic trends groups? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on all forms and sources of 
extremism 
and terrorism does not change because it is a principled one. 
We have condemned terrorism and will continue to do so. 
Several years ago, we published the book "Proselytizers and Not 
Judges" by the late Hasan al-Hudaybi, the former Brotherhood 
leader, so as to correct the concepts and fight terrorism. 
Freedom, security, and safety are every citizen's right. It is 
an inherent right that God has granted to man. People's rights 
are inviolable. God made them and Islam has stressed them, that 
is their lives, properties, and honor. For God, these are more 
sacrosanct than the al-Qa'bah. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] Is there an indirect link between this 
campaign against you and the Brotherhood's strong opposition to 
peace with the Zionist enemy? Could this campaign affect your 
stand? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] Our stand on the Gaza-Jericho agreement is a 
principled one. Our stand on the usurping Jewish entity is also 
a principled one. Palestine is an Arab, Islamic country and its 
cause is an Islamic one. Those who have the right to it cannot 
relinquish a single inch of it or concede any part of it because 
this would be against the shari'ah of God Almighty who has 
ordered jihad to liberate the land, avenge honor, and expel the 
hostile intruder. The nation should be taught this through the 
media, culture, education, and all possible ways and means. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] How do you reply to the constant attempts 
and propaganda to accuse the Brotherhood of terrorism or of 
encouraging it by referring to the events of the forties and to 
the Muslim Brotherhood's secret organization? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] As we said, the Muslim Brothers have rejected 
and condemned terrorism. We believe that the false allegations 
claiming that they support or back it cannot negate or cover up 
the truth or deceive the people or grip their minds. Even 
though the campaigns against the Brotherhood are falling thick 
and thin and even though the Muslim Brothers are deprived of the 
right to reply because they have no access to any media channel, 
right is clear and God Almighty defends those who believe. The 
noble Egyptian people are so aware as to be able to expose the 
lies and aspersions. 
  Regarding the allegations of secret organizations, the 
Muslim 
Brothers have no secret organizations and do not resort to 
secrecy. The Brotherhood had its own system in the forties due 
to special circumstances, namely the circumstances of 
colonialism which was in control of the country at the time in 
addition to the royal palace's treachery. Therefore, there was 
this special system in order to confront colonialism and to 
liberate the land. The Muslim Brotherhood's actions and battles 
in Palestine and the Suez Canal were great and are recorded by 
history. This special system ended when the English evacuated 
Egypt and the Muslim Brothers entered prisons and detention 
camps in the mid-fifties. 
  ['Abd-al-Rahman] What do you say to President Mubarak? 
  [Abu-al-Nasr] I tell President Mubarak and all the Arab 
leaders this: The nation needs the unity of your ranks. Act to 
unite its ranks. Applying God's shari'ah is a trust in your 
hands and a duty and everyone will be accounted for it before 
God Almighty. Mobilize the resources and capabilities to apply 
it. Freedom and security are inherent rights for all the 
people. Provide them for everyone.

<F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Rahman Isma'il] </F>
  [Text] The negotiations between the government and the IMF 
have reached a dead end. The IMF insists that the government 
devalue the Egyptian pound and offer a large number of public 
sector companies for sale in exchange for its recommending that 
one-third of Egypt's debts be waived; that is, $4 billion, which 
are scheduled to be forgiven this month under the agreement 
signed between the government and the IMF in the summer of 1991. 
  The talks held last week between government officials and a 
team from the World Bank were fraught with acute differences, as 
each side stuck to its position. The government asked the World 
Bank team to postpone the devaluation of the pound to a later 
stage and promised in return to accelerate the privatization 
process and sell a considerable number of public sector 
companies in the coming months. 
  Zafin Burmister [name as transliterated], World Bank 
representative in Cairo, has stated at a ceremony marking the 
bank's 50th anniversary that the government has pledged to the 
bank to privatize more than 80 public companies in the coming 
months. He added that the government is keen on fully 
implementing the program signed with the bank and the IMF to 
have a third of its debts forgiven. 
  Mahmud 'Abd-al-'Aziz, chairman of the Banks' Union, has 
stated that banks will stop accepting any new deposits as a 
result of the increase in the deposits they now hold. He added: 
Unless the government hastens to issue long-term bonds enabling 
the banks to invest the accumulating funds in their possession, 
the banks will find themselves compelled to stop accepting new 
deposits. Speaking to journalists during a seminar on Arab 
banking on Sunday [19 June], 'Abd-al-'Aziz explained that the 
banks will not accept money it cannot invest. The increase in 
deposits held by the banks, he added, will lead to a drop in the 
interest rates.

Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. The meeting was attended by 
brothers secretary for the General People's Committee, the 
secretary for the People's Bureau for Foreign Liaison and

of the revolution was at the head of those saying farewell to 
President Husni Mubarak at Khalij Surt's civilian airport. 
[passage omitted] 
  President Mubarak made a statement to JANA's correspondent 
before departure. He said: My visits to the Great Jamahiriyah 
are continuous and have a positive effect on the Arab people in 
Egypt and Libya. Our meeting as brothers gives us the 
opportunity to exchange views in Arab, international, and 
bilateral issues. 
  He indicated that all these topics were discussed during the 
meeting. 
  Concerning the Great Jamahiriyah's absence from a meeting of 
Mediterranean basin countries due to be held in Cairo next week, 
President Husni Mubarak said that a restricted preparatory 
committee meeting will be held, and not all Mediterranean basin 
countries will participate. It will prepare a conference, draw

  [Excerpt] Sirte, 27 June (MENA) -- [passage omitted] 
Al-Qadhdhafi said that the recent proposal adopted by the Arab 
League on the Lockerbie case could be the only solution for this 
crisis. He added that this proposal, which "is convincing and 
satisfactory for all the parties," will be submitted to the 
Security Council by the Arab group, the nonaligned countries, 
and the African states and could be accepted because it is not a 
Libyan one. 
  In his remarks on developments in the Lockerbie case, Col. 
al-Qadhdhafi said that there are now strong suspicions that 
Libya is not the sole defendant in this case but that there are 
several parties, especially after the confessions of Yusuf 
Sha'ban, who is being tried before a Lebanese court. 
  On tightening the sanctions imposed on Libya, he stressed 
that his country is ready to confront any situation. But he 
expressed his belief that the European countries will be the 
only losers in this. 
  On his meeting with the wife of Mansur al-Kikhya [Libyan 
dissident who disappeared while in Egypt], al-Qadhdhafi said: 
We met and I stressed to her that the security organs in Egypt 
and Libya are fully cooperating to uncover the truth. He 
pointed a finger of accusation at the U.S. intelligence and its 
Libyan agents.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Libya: Britain Would Be the First </F>
Loser If Sanctions Are Escalated"] 
  [Text] Cairo, AL-HAYAH -- A highly placed Libyan 
diplomatic source in Cairo has warned British officials against 
continuing to reject the Arab and Libyan proposals for the 
settlement of the Lockerbie crisis. He said: "Britain would be 
the first loser if the sanctions against Libya were escalated to 
include Libya's oil exports. [no closing quotemarks as 
published] He pointed out that 7,000 Britons worked in the 
Libyan oil sector and that the trade balance between the two 
countries was $1.5 billion in Britain's favor. In a statement 
to AL-HAYAH yesterday, the source criticized what he described 
as "the West's intransigence against the Arab League's proposal 
calling for the implementation of international legitimacy by 
having the two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie case stand trial 
before a Scottish court at the headquarters of the International 
Court of Justice." He added: "That rejection is not only a 
stand against Libya but also a slap to all the Arab states." He 
said that if the Arab League proposal was rejected and the 
Western states concerned with the crisis insisted on escalating 
it, then the Arab states should not comply with the economic 
sanctions imposed on his country since April 1992 under Security 
Council Resolution 748, and should resume flights between the 
Arab states and Libya. He said that "if the Arab states did 
that, they would command world respect. Not all the Security 
Council resolutions are always in their favor. In fact, the 
majority of these resolutions are applied by some states and 
ignored by others." 
  Meanwhile, Ambassador 'Adnan 'Imran, the Arab League's 
assistant secretary general for political affairs, has stated 
that the Arab League's proposal for the settlement of the 
Lockerbie crisis placed the ball in the West's court. He said 
that the proposal took into consideration international 
legitimacy and Libya's sovereignty at the same time, and that 
the Western states should respond to the Arab proposal which is 
also supported by the Organization of African Unity and the 
Nonaligned Movement. 
  In a statement to AL-HAYAH, 'Imran said that Libya is 
serious 
in its efforts to close the Lockerbie file, adding that Western 
rejection raised some questions about this issue. He said: "If 
the Western states have sufficient evidence to support the 
charges then why do they not agree to the trial of the suspects 
at the headquarters of the International Court of Justice?" 
  Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has sent 
new messages to the foreign ministers of the United States, 
France, and Britain stressing that agreement to the trial of the 
Libyan suspects in the Hague "would spare the region unnecessary 
dangers. A settlement of this issue would increase confidence in 
the new world order."

  [Excerpt] Tripoli, Al Sayf [June] 25, JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS 
AGENCY -- The leader of the revolution visited the residence of 
the children of Bosnia-Herzegovina being hosted by the Great 
Jamahiriyah as a result of a humanitarian gesture by the leader 
to lessen the losses suffered due to the fighting between 
warring factions in the former Yugoslavia. The visit of the 
leader of the revolution came as the children were (?soon) to 
leave the Great Jamahiryah upon the request of the Bosnian 
Government which confirmed that the areas the children will 
return to have become safe areas. During the visit, the leader 
of the revolution met with these children in an encounter which 
showed the human interest extended by the leader to them and 
their well being and provision of all the necessary resources 
and comfort in the Great Jamahiryah. 
  On this occasion, the leader of the revolution made the 
following speech: 
  "Firstly, we are pleased that you are returning to your 
families who are now in safe areas. But we are sad to see you 
go for you are our children [words indistinct] too you were in 
your home and with your fathers and mothers who are Libyans. 
Now you have mothers and fathers both in Libya and Bosnia. 
Your home is Bosnia and Libya. Also we are happy at your return 
to your families. We are sad at the plight suffered by the 
Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is a hard lesson not 
only for the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina but to the 
international conscience. A bitter lesson for all mankind. But 
this bitterness leads us for further struggle against religious 
and racial discrimination. This was responsible for this 
tragedy hence we must fight for the eliminaion of the enemies of 
mankind. We fight against those who enjoy the suffering of 
children. The killing of fathers and mothers of these children 
constitutes a horrific crime and so was the separation of a 
little child from his mother and father in Europe which fooled 
us with the its [as received] claim of being civilized while it 
was without any conscience. The whole peaceful population of 
Yugoslavia was subjected to an ugly crime. This people was 
united and Yugoslavs were living next to each regardless of 
their religion. Muslims were living with Christians. It was 
one people living in one country. However, criminal power and 
influence seekers did not hesistate to torture you and render 
you homeless. What is the value of any new action if only 
achieved on the dead bodies of these children? What is the 
worth of any objective if achieved only at the expense of these 
children and as a result of torturing them? You were not the 
only victims of torture. Human conscience was tortured and all 
honourable peoples in the world felt your pain. You have 
provided a history lesson. You showed the consequences of war 
and religious discrimination. You have rendered a service to 
mankind for by being separated from your parents and the torture 
you endured you showed that war is a harmful and renounced act 
and that religious and racial discrimination is a despicable 
[word indistinct]. We are sad at your leaving and God willing, 
we will meet with you when you are older and stronger when you 
would have forgotten this difficult period. We hope to see you 
when you are happier." [passage omitted]

<F P=106> ["Standpoint" column by Sabri Hammadi: "The Bankrupt Regime </F>
and the Continuous Milking"] 
  [Text] Despite the continuous evidence about the bankruptcy 
of the Saudi regime and the fact that it is going through a very 
difficult economic situation this year, milking of that regime 
has not stopped. U.S. President Clinton continues to order 
Fahd's regime to conclude deals with U.S. firms involving 
billions of dollars! 
  Following the conclusion of the $6 billion airliner deal 
with 
U.S. companies, which the Saudi regime had to pay through loans 
from a consortium of local and U.S. banks, there are now reports 
that Clinton has ordered the Saudi regime to grant a $4 billion 
deal to the American Telecommunications Company despite the fact 
that other international non-American companies have made 
attractive bids which are far below the bid of the American 
company! 
  Although the Saudi regime is going through the worst deficit 
in its history and has been forced to cut its expenditures in 
the 1994 budget by 20 percent after spending all the surpluses 
it made in the eighties during the past four years, the U.S. 
administration is still pressuring that regime in order to 
extract its last penny. Otherwise, what is the meaning of 
Clinton's personal intervention in favor of American firms as in 
the airliner deal and now the deal to set up 500,000 telephone 
lines. 
  At any rate, this is not all the Saudi rulers are disposing 
of from the oil revenues with such utter insolence and 
recklessness. There are also the bribes given by the agent 
regime in order to prolong the blockade on Iraq, and the vast 
sums which are spent on corrupting news media and those working 
in them. More than that, there are the sums which are assigned 
for plots and aggressions against everything nationalist, 
progressive, and honest in the Arab homeland. 
  No doubt, U.S. milking of Fahd's regime will not stop at the 
telephone deal. From time to time the Saudi regime, or the 
Americans themselves, will invent new deals and projects in 
billions of dollars. Yesterday it was the airliner deal, today 
the telephone deal, and tomorrow it could be a submarine deal! 
Yes, a Saudi official has announced that "Saudi Arabia" is 
considering the purchase of submarines to guarantee its security 
in the Gulf and the Red Sea. Naturally, the Saudi regime will 
need U.S. submarines for that! 
  The main thing is to boost the depressed U.S. economy and 
create job opportunities for unemployed Americans. Above all, 
what is important is to please the American master even if the 
Saudi regime has to spend its last penny.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>
  [Text] Baghdad--Iraq has emphasized its rejection of any 
terms or amendments to the Iraqi-Turkish agreement on operating 
the Iraqi oil pipeline crossing Turkish territory under any 
pretext. 
  Iraqi Oil Minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said that 
maintaining 
this pipeline should be done directly by the two sides. He 
asserted that Turkey should begin implementation of this 
agreement without consultation with the UN Security Council. 
The minister pointed out that the Iraqi-Turkish agreement on 
cleaning and maintaining the pipeline is not based on commercial 
considerations, asserting that the agreement was signed within a 
purely technical framework in order to maintain the pipeline 
which is liable to erosion and damage due to the Iraqi oil 
retained in it since early August 1990. 
  The Iraqi minister said that Iraq and Turkey agreed to use 
part of the revenues of the oil contained in the pipeline to 
repay some debts which Iraq owes Turkey and to use the other 
part of the revenues to purchase food commodities, baby milk, 
and medical and pharmaceutical supplies from Turkish sources. 
The international resolutions do not ban Iraq from importing 
these items. In practice, however, they obstruct their 
importation because the Iraqi assets abroad are still frozen and 
Iraq is prevented from exporting its oil freely.

  [Text] Nicosia, June 27 (AFP)--Iraq now has the capacity to 
export more than two million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil, 
its oil minister Dr. Safa' Hadi Jawad said in an interview 
published here on Monday. 
  Iraq will also demand an output quota "at parity with Iran," 
currently 3.6 million bpd, from the Organisation of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries (OPEC) when UN sanctions are lifted, Jawad 
told the MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES). 
  A United Nations embargo on Iraqi oil exports was imposed 
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. Iraq's 
production quota was set at the same level with Iran's quota in 
July 1990. 
  Jawad said Iraq had met UN resolutions to destroy its 
weapons 
of mass destruction, the condition for the lifting of the 
embargo. 
  "We feel that we will soon return to the market," Jawad told 
the specialist newsletter published in Cyprus during an 
interview in Vienna. 
  "We can export more than 2 million bpd now. The export 
outlets are ready. We sustained heavy damage, but we have 
repaired around 90 per cent of the damaged facilities," he added. 
  Jawad said Iraq could export between 1.2 and 1.3 million bpd 
through the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline, which has a capacity of 1.8 
million bpd, and 1.2 million bpd through the Mina' al-Bakr 
export terminal on the Gulf. 
  Repairs on the nearby Khawr al-Amaya terminal would be ready 
in the next few months to provide an initial export capacity of 
600,000 bpd, al-Habubi said. 
  "We can also resort to exporting by trucks through Turkey 
and 
Jordan, as we did during the eighties. Hence the fact that we 
cannot use the Iraqi-Saudi pipeline will not affect our export 
capacity during the initial export stage." 
  The minister said Iraqi officials have visited Italy, 
Ukraine 
and France recently to discuss joint oil projects, but said 
there had been no negotiations yet with Japanese firms. 
  Jawad said Iraq would "give priority to those companies 
which 
have held negotiations with us during the embargo," after 
sanctions were lifted. 
  Iraq discussed with Ukraine the construction of a spur line 
from the Iraqi-Turkish pipeline to Turkey's Black Sea coast, 
from where oil could be exported to the Ukraine.

Ministry of Industry and Minerals has described as successful 
and fruitful the recent visit to Iraq by a delegation of French 
businessmen representing 28 French companies. 
  In a statement to INA, the source added that several

contribute toward the activation of developmental and industrial 
projects in Iraq in the interest of the two sides. He also

  [Text] Baghdad, June 28, INA -- A recent report issued by 
the Ministry of Culture and Information on the impact of the 
embargo imposed on the country four years now said that it had 
adversely affected all sectors in Iraq. 
  Minister of Trade Dr Muhammad Mahdi Salih and experts in 
dietetics stressed the fact that the nutritional value of the 
commodity actually available is one half of the normal 
consumption level required for an average man. 
  Prior to the sanctions, Iraq used to import annually about 3 
billion dollars worth of foodstuffs, of which 300 million 
dollars for baby formula alone. 
  These imports, however, are either disrupted completely or 
severely restricted. Baby formula at cheap market prices are 
now beyond the reach of the majority of the children. 
  Before August 1990, the individual's share of the food 
basket 
distributed by the state was 25 kg per month valued at ID [Iraqi 
dinar] 4,50 or 1.50 dollars. The basket included dried, fresh 
and canned commodities. 
  Considering all food items together, the food ration card 
provides about 1736.6 calories per person per day, little less 
than one half of average calorie intake which stands at 2306 
calories and 64.2 g of protein per day. 
  Food prices have risen quite substantially due to the 
general 
constraints on imports and of freezing Iraq foreign assets 
abroad. Pre-sanctions prices were extremely low compared to 
those prevailing in neighbouring countries. 
  The sharp increase in food price index has led to a 
corresponding higher levels of inflation. Current retail prices 
are higher by 4231 times for foodstuffs, 2933 times for meat, 
fish and eggs, 1463 times for vegetables and 1115 times for 
fruits. 
  Other commodities such as household items and consumer 
durable goods, which the Ministry of Trade used to provide 
before 1991, have been totally discontinued as a result of the 
oppressive resolutions and US continued pressure on the Security 
Council Sanctions Committee. 
  The sanctions imposed also hampered the importation of the 
spare parts, equipment, tyres and batteries required to maintain 
the internal transport capabilities. 
  According to the Ministry of Trade sources, foreign 
companies 
which used to run business with Iraq before 1990, have lost 
about US 55 billion since the inception of the economic and 
trade embargo.

  [Text] Baghdad, June 27, INA -- 384,022 persons of all age 
groups had died for various reasons as a result of the effects 
of the blockade between August 1990 and March 1994, while in 
1989, the year prior to the sanctions, the number of deaths was 
23,334. 
  A recent report issued by the Ministry of Culture and 
Information, covering the impact of the blockade on the health, 
food, education and environment sectors said the nutritional 
situation of the children under five years of age, the most 
vulnerable group, is particularly alarming. 
  There has been a sharp and significant increase in cases of 
severe malnutrition and related syndromes such as marasmus and 
kwashiorkor [nutritional dystrophy] and of deficiencies of 
protein, calorie and vitamins. 
  The number of cases reported from August 1990 to March 1994 
totalled 4,192,603. 
  The report added the under-five mortality rate has increased 
nearly five fold, rising from 23.8 in 1990 to 126 deaths per 
thousand live births since the sanctions began. 
  This is mainly due to the shortage of vaccines and 
suspension 
of maternal and child health programme. 
  Some communicable diseases which Iraq succeeded to eradicate 
are now widespread. There has been a sudden and striking 
incidence of water-born diseases including cholera, typhoid and 
hepatitis and of other, previously uncommon and completely 
preventable children diseases such as poliomyelitis, measles and 
tetanus. 
  Major surgical interventions have been reduced to 30 percent 
of their pre-sanctions levels and are limited to emergencies 
only. 
  The remaining 70 percent of the operations has been 
suspended 
indefinitely due to the lack of anaesthetic agents and 
dispensable equipment. 
  According to the minister of health, Dr Umid Midhat Mubarak, 
the acute shortage of anaesthetic drugs for curing dental 
diseases have compelled the dentists to look for local 
alternatives which, at best, produce one quarter or half of the 
effect needed. Most patients are now treated with no 
administration of anaesthetics. 
  Laboratory test have been effected tremendously by the 
severe 
shortage of reagents necessary for laboratory diagnosis and of 
laboratory apparatus. 
  Hospital and medical stores suffer greatly from the lack of 
life-sustaining drugs for the treatment of certain 
cardio-vascular, metabolic and endocrine diseases. 
  The problem has been further exacerbated with the shortage 
of 
intravenous replacement fluids and blood transfusion apparatus 
and also with the shortage of serums. 
  Hospitals and health centres are now re-sterilizing and 
re-using glass syringes between patients as disposable plastic 
syringes, all imported from abroad, are no longer available. 
  The plastic syringes plant, at Babil province, has been 
heavily bombarded by US warplanes. 
  The Security Council Sanctions Committee did not approve the 
supply of the equipment needed to put the plant back into 
effective operation. 
  Drugs and medical supplies to Iraq have been substantially 
reduced as a result of the sanctions imposed on the country and 
of the US continued pressure on foreign companies and banks. 
  Iraq used to import annually approximately 400-500 million 
dollars worth of drugs and medical appliances alone. 
  A large proportion of women and children, experiencing 
missile attacks and bombing of residential areas at close range, 
are invariably forced to endure conditions of severe hardship 
and stress. 
  The exposure to certain kinds of guided bombs which, when 
exploded, produce poisonous gases, has led to cases of abortion, 
premature deliveries and congenital deformity, not to mention 
their subsequent effect on the individual's pathological 
behaviour. 
  A Harvard study team found that the majority of Iraqi 
children suffer from emotional reactions (depression, sadness, 
anxiety and fear) and from cognitive reaction (sleep and 
concentration problems). 
  The team also reported that 57 percent of the women 
interviewed suffer from related symptoms like fatigue, insomnia 
and weight loss. 
  Health training institutions, over the past four years, have 
lost about 80 opportunities for training abroad. 
  These cover surgery, medicine, dermatology, dentistry, 
anaesthesia, pathology, psychiatry, orthopaedics, physiotherapy 
and radiology. Medical publications, on the other hand, have 
been banned from entering Iraq because of the sanctions.

<F P=106> [Article By Salah al-'Abd and Nabil al-Wadi] </F>
  [Excerpt] The Doctors Union has issued new instructions 
fixing the charges of medical examinations in private clinics. 
These instructions urge all doctors to comply with the new 
charges, which range from 50 to 100 dinars for a specialized 
doctor and from 25 to 50 dinars for a practitioner. 
  Dr. Nayif al-Hassuni, head of the Doctors Union, said that 
these measures by the union came at the instructions of the 
Council of Ministers to ease the burdens of the citizens. 
  The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH has followed the issue of 
charges 
for medical examinations in private clinics and noticed that 
these charges rose in conflict with the citizens' standard of 
living, especially for employees with low incomes. In a number 
of cases, these charges exceeded 500 dinars, when it used to be 
only 10 dinars. The paper also noticed that the rise in the 
charges is due to imposing additional charges, including charges 
for testing blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiography.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Hamas Threatens To Step Up Its </F>
Military Operations"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Hamas has said that the 
"Palestinian agents' voice was silent throughout the occupation 
period in the Gaza Strip and should not rise now under 
Palestinian self-administration." 
  Engineer Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, 
added in a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the movement is 
very keen "not to cause the agents issue to explode conditions 
in the self-rule areas. Thus the Palestinian Authority must 
arrest those who murdered a Hamas member as soon as possible, 
bring them to trial, and publish the files for the Palestinian 
people." Ghawshah was commenting on the incident in which Zahir 
Salluhah, an element from the military wing of the 'Izz-al-Din 
al-Qassam Battalions in Gaza, was killed. He described it as "a 
serious incident, and Hamas puts the entire responsibility on 
the Palestinian Authority's shoulder." 
  He added that "any laxity in pursuing the murderers will 
mean 
that Hamas has to return to defending itself." He pointed out 
that "it has been proved to anyone who cast doubt on Hamas' 
strength that the huge mass funeral in the Strip last Friday, 
which Palestinian police commanders had to join, proves that 
Hamas is very popular among Palestinians." 
  Ghawshah pointed out that "Hamas' strength elements are used 
against the Zionist occupation, not against the Palestinian 
people, to which Hamas belongs." 
  Ghawshah revealed the reasons for the decline in armed 
operations against the occupation forces last month. He said 
that "Hamas' jihad and resistance plans have decreased since the 
Palestinian Authority assumed its duties -- which is expected, 
the aim being to reengage the occupation [forces] through jihad 
and resistance, taking account of the changes that have taken 
place on the ground." 
  The official spokesman promised to "step up the jihad and 
armed operations against occupation forces in a manner that will 
certainly dash the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's hopes."

<F P=106> [Interview with Fathi al-Shiqaqi, identified as a </F>
"co-founder" of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, by 
Hanadi Salman in al-Yarmuk Camp in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Salman] It seems the movement 
is heading toward establishing a political movement. Is this so? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] There is much talk about this, but we have not 
yet reached a point that permits us to announce a political 
front or a political party inside Palestine by tomorow. 
However, this is how things look. We do not want any sort of 
collision with the new Palestinian Authority. Since we do not 
want collision and since armed collision is wrong, then what we 
are required to do is to intensify our political, social, and 
cultural activity in the self- rule areas, but of course not at 
the expense of our jihad. This leads us to think of 
establishing an Islamic-national-popular bloc that could act as 
a political opposition to the settlement and to the Zionist 
trends that currently exist within the self-government authority 
without colliding with them. Debates are now underway within 
the movement to find a mechanism for this. Discussions are also 
under way with our friends in Hamas [Islamic Resistance 
Movement] on the nature and type of this framework, etc... 
However, some obstacles and many unanswered questions still 
remain before us. 
  [Salman] So you are talking about a framework that is not 
confined to the "Islamic Jihad" only? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Such a framework, if established, would not act 
as a substitute for the Jihad Movement. The Islamic Jihad 
Movement will continue to exist and operate covertly inside the 
occupied territories. It will play the same role it is playing 
now. On the other hand, if such a framework is established it 
will not be a party exclusive to the Islamic Jihad. We will try 
to make it a party or a framework grouping all the 
oppositionists. We could fail, but at least we always try to 
make it broader than the Islamic Jihad and to involve other 
popular figures. 
  [Salman] What is the response of the other quarters you are 
contacting? Are they positive? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] In principle, yes. But questions and 
complications always come up. The reality we live in inside 
Palestine is still difficult. Questions arise about the nature 
of the self-rule authority, how it will assume its role, and how 
it will deal with the opposition and with the enemy. All these 
questions are put forward making us unable to come to a final or 
decisive picture of the framework of which we are thinking. 
  [Salman] You said that the Jihad Movement will continue to 
play the same role it is playing now. Does this apply to the 
entire West Bank and Gaza or are Gaza and Jericho excluded? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Our work will continue in all Palestine. The 
self-rule area makes up 2 percent or less of the total area of 
Palestine; that is, there is 98 percent of Palestine that will 
be open for jihad against the enemy as the case was before, and 
we hope it will grow. Within the self-rule area, our decision 
is that the occupation still exists; in fact its military 
presence has intensified. Thus, so long as the occupation 
remains, we believe that it is our right to confront this 
occupation by force. The military operations we have carried 
out following the redeployment [of Israeli troops] or following 
the entry of the [Palestinian] police sought to prove to the 
world and to our people that the occupation still exists. The 
operations were carried out in the northern, southern, and 
central parts of Gaza. We clashed with soldiers wherever we 
found them. Thus, the Israeli withdrawal is a trick and is not 
real. So even in these areas we will continue until we see a 
real withdrawal. Once we see a real withdrawal from the 
self-rule areas we will stop. But if the occupation remains, we 
will continue our jihad. 
  [Salman] How can a confrontation with the Palestinian 
Authority be avoided? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We always appeal to the Palestinian police and 
the new Authority to examine our objectives and pay heed to the 
fact that we really give priority to the avoidance of any clash 
with them. Nevertheless, we cannot allow [Israeli] soldiers to 
remain around us while we sit back and watch them. In all our 
statements, we address the Palestinian police on this issue, 
saying that we cannot halt our jihad as long as we see one 
Israeli soldier able to come into the Gaza Strip and pursue our 
mujahidin. This whole issue remains under discussion but we 
still give priority to non- confrontation with the police and 
the Authority. 
  [Salman] Have the Palestinian police given any signs of 
their 
intentions toward the movement? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] In the past few weeks, the Palestinian police 
have arrested more than one brother from the Islamic Jihad 
Movement. They were subsequently released but their detention 
came as a surprise to us. We believe it was not a step in the 
right direction. Still, we have discovered that they want to 
start a dialogue with the movement inside Palestine. We are not 
refusing, particularly if the dialogue is conducted inside 
Palestine with the aim of avoiding any clashes, which can happen 
at any time. We have also heard that people from other groups 
have been arrested. We are surprised that the Palestinian 
Authority, already accused of being a tool of the Zionist enemy, 
should take steps to prove this charge by detaining mujahidin 
formerly wanted by the occupation authorities. 
  Despite our goodwill and willingness to avoid clashes, and 
even our abstention from sharing authority with them, the 
situation remains unclear and the Authority's attitude to the 
opposition remains confused. 
  [Salman] Have you actually begun a dialogue with the 
Palestinian Authority or is this still just an idea at this 
stage? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] When the recent arrests took place, some 
brothers, Islamic Jihad sympathizers, conducted a dialogue with 
the new Authority to secure the release of the detainees. 
  [Salman] Was the dialogue limited to this issue? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Naturally the dialogue branched off onto other 
issues. Just as the brothers made demands, the Authority made 
demands. These arrests have been partly a form of political 
blackmail. They held some young men as hostages to make the 
movement change its policies toward the occupation. We harbor 
no violent designs against the Palestinian Authority. We have 
political designs. They want us to alter our policies toward 
the occupation in return for releasing our brothers. Of course 
we rejected this logic and insisted on exercising our right to 
resist the occupation as long as it lasts. 
  [Salman] Some movements opposed to the agreement have said 
that they will not alter their policies but will alter their 
"tactics" in the future. Does this apply to Islamic Jihad also? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] This is possible. When we speak in a political 
context, this signifies an alteration of tactics. It was 
impossible to speak in a political context when the occupation 
authorities were still here, or in the areas where the 
occupation continues. This proves that we can alter our moves. 
  [Salman] Has anything been decided in this context or is the 
issue under discussion? Changes on the political front are 
merely one form of alteration. 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] The movement is still debating the question of 
military action against occupation troops in the autonomy areas. 
Our decision at this moment remains to confront the occupation 
forces. 
  [Salman] Some opponents of the Islamic Jihad Movement say 
that the movement's only chance of survival is to adhere to its 
opposition of the Declaration of Principles since it does not 
possess the popularity or the seniority of the other Palestinian 
movements, which someday could be prepared to join the National 
Authority. What do you say? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] First: The Islamic Jihad Movement is well 
established in Palestine. Everybody knows that it and Hamas are 
the two most prominent opposition movements inside Palestine. 
It is present in every city and village in Palestine. True, 
its presence is less than that of Hamas, but its history is very 
recent and financial resources are very limited. So any 
comparison between us and Hamas would no doubt show that our 
presence in Palestine is less than Hamas'. We have very limited 
resources compared to the other Palestinian organizations, but 
we have managed to maintain a relatively active presence. 
Second: We are not the only opponents of the Declaration of 
Principles. There are 10 or more factions opposed to the 
Declaration of Principles. Even the Communist Party, which is 
now called the People's Party, has issued a statement opposing 
the Cairo Agreement. This means that the People's Party has 
agreed to the Oslo Agreement but rejected the Cairo Agreement. 
The only movement that supports the Declaration of Principles is 
Fatah; that is, part, but not all, of Yasir 'Arafat's group. So 
if we are talking about opposition, we are not the first or last 
oppositionists. The opposition is comprehensive and wide. But 
if we are talking about military action, this is another story. 
  [Salman] But with the signs indicating that some other 
movements are prepared to join the National Authority, is your 
refusal to join this Authority what makes you stand out? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] The opposition movements inside Palestine, be 
they Hamas or other national forces, still refuse to join the 
authority. For us, it seems that not everybody is convinced of 
participating in the authority and when we say so we mean it. 
This stems from the nature of the ideology and ideas we believe 
in and from the nature of our stand vis-a-vis the Zionist enemy 
and the new authority. Throughout our history, our friends, 
allies, and even adversaries know that we do not deceive or 
double-talk and that when we say something we mean it. Thus, 
the question of non-participation is not due to the 
insignificance of the movement as much as it is the result of a 
firm conviction held by every individual within the movement. 
  [Salman] How do you assess the Jihad Movement's relations 
with Hamas? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Hamas are excellent. Hamas 
is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood and represents the 
shift within the intifadah. Before the intifadah, we used to 
differ over some theoretical and practical matters inside 
Palestine, particularly the need for immediate jihad. This 
issue was a source of disagreement between us. But with the 
outbreak of the intifadah, the gap narrowed and the 
sensitivities diminished. This was accompanied by several 
official meetings from the two sides over the past five years. 
We met inside Palestine and abroad and held lengthy discussions 
in an attempt to find as much common ground as possible and 
coordinate between us. At the theoretical and political levels, 
our relations are very good, but there is still a distance we 
have to travel toward establishing things on the ground, such as 
the formation of a stronger front or stronger institutions. We 
have not yet succeeded in this matter, but in the theoretical 
and political domains, there has been great understanding and 
coordination in the past years. There is a tendency toward 
establishing more coordination with Hamas. Meetings have been 
held recently toward that end. 
  [Salman] Were the meetings held inside and abroad? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes. 
  [Salman] What about Al-Jihad's relations with the Fatah 
movement? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Yasir 'Arafat have never 
been 
positive. There are no personal sensitivities between us. We 
have never met in a battle or at a dinner table. Relations have 
not been positive because of the political line followed by 
'Arafat during the past years, his constant plotting against the 
Islamic al-Jihad Movement, and his attempts to tempt and disrupt 
the movement's ranks and create dummy organizations under the 
"Islamic al-Jihad's" name. Therefore, and to protest this 
political and scheming line, we have always refused to even meet 
him despite his persistence and his dispatch of envoys to us. 
  But this does not prevent us from having ties of friendship 
with some of Fatah's cadres or youths inside the occupied 
territories. They were serious in resisting the occupation from 
outside and inside the prisons. This has also not prevented us 
from receiving in our offices and houses some Fatah figures 
whose views differ from 'Arafat's. 
  [Salman] Al-Jihad Movement says that it refuses to have a 
dialogue with 'Arafat, while he says that he does not want to 
have a dialogue with you in the first place? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] He has never said that he refuses to have a 
dialogue with us. He has sent one delegation after the other to 
this office. (Police commander) Yusuf Nasr was one of those he 
has sent and Nasr said in an interview few days ago that he is 
having a dialogue with the "Islamic al-Jihad" movement. 
  [Salman] A dialogue through the detainees? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] No. The dialogues were held inside [the 
territories]. Messengers from Yasir 'Arafat came here to this 
office several times. We told them that we are not opposed to 
having a dialogue with those whom we respect personally, but we 
are not willing to start a dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. This is 
our stand that they always took back with them despite the many 
messeges that were sent. 
  They even contacted us on behalf of Yasir 'Arafat exactly 
two 
weeks ago to ask us to initiate a dialogue. They contacted us 
here and said that 'Arafat wants to open a dialogue with us in 
order to solve the problems inside. We rejected any form of 
contacts outside the territories and said that the problems must 
be solved in the field between those involved in them. 
  [Salman] Is it true that you were offered seats on the 
Palestine National Council [PNC]? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes, when the 19th or 20th PNC session was held 
in Algeria. The number of seats was not specified but they said 
that the PNC is open to us and we could participate. We replied 
in a letter distributed to all the members. We also issued a 
statement in which we said that we were not seeking seats but a 
solid and strong stand, which we would support even if we did 
not a have a seat in the PNC. National unity is not merely a 
framework but a solid program. 
  [Salman] Does this mean that the dialogue with the PLO is 
severed until Yasir 'Arafat's downfall? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] I do not know if there is still a PLO or not. 
There is today a new self-rule administration. Will there be 
talks with the self-rule administration or not? As to the PLO, 
it is difficult for Yasir 'Arafat to say that he is talking on 
its behalf today. There is nothing called the PLO anymore. 
There is in fact a new authority that cancels all the past. 
  [Salman] What about the dialogue with the new authority? 
  [Al-Shiqaqi] We are pragmatists. Inside Palestine, we will 
be ready to disengage from any clash with any party, whether it 
is the new authority or others.

  [Text] Kuwait, 25 Jun -- In a press statement published 
here today, Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah, first deputy prime 
minister and minister of foreign affairs, stressed the rejection 
of any threats or accusations made against the Gulf Cooperation 
Council [GCC] because of support for the secessionist Yemeni 
state, or that it supported one side at the expense of the other. 
  In a statement to the newspaper AL-ANBA, Shaykh Sabah 
al-Ahmad expressed regret over the Yemeni president's attack on 
GCC states because of the GCC's statement in which it supported 
the UN Security Council resolution, saying that this attack was 
a hard to forgive mistake. 
  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad affirmed that all Damascus Declaration 
states were awaiting the current international move aimed at 
resolving the Yemeni crisis and the outcome of the efforts of 
the UN envoy regarding this crisis. He said that these states 
were also awaiting the results the envoy had achieved, which he 
would present to the UN secretary general and the Security 
Council. 
  In light of these results, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad added that 
developments and their required resolutions could be discussed 
during the meeting of the Damascus Declaration's foreign 
ministers to be held in Kuwait on 27 June.

  [Excerpts] Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah has said there 
was no justification for "Israel" doing what it did last week. 
He expected "Israel" to plan more security and military blows. 
He expressed the fear that the self-rule accord could become a 
bridge across which the Israelis would infiltrate the Arab 
economy using the Palestinian factor. He affirmed that the PLO 
has cooperated in the security field with "Israel" since 1982 
and then with European intelligence services against the 
Islamists. 
  Fadlallah made these remarks during his weekly lesson on the 
interpretation of the Koran. He also fielded questions from the 
audience. [passage omitted] 
  Asked about a statement by a Lebanese diplomat that the 
recent U.S. stance at the UN Security Council was based on the 
consideration that Hizballah has non-Lebanese connections, 
Fadlallah said: The U.S. says the Resistance is Iranian and in 
some cases Syrian and that it receives its instructions from 
abroad. Let us, for the sake of argument, accept the U.S. logic 
that the Resistance must be disarmed because it is not Lebanese 
or because it has non- Lebanese connections. The United States 
has not demanded the disarmament of the South Lebanese Army 
[SLA]. Does the SLA have Lebanese or Israeli connections? Why 
doesn't the United States demand its disarmament? Why does it 
agree that it should stay so that it will strike its people in 
the south and western al-Biqa' and defend "Israel?" Is the 
Israeli army present in the border area because it has Lebanese 
connections? Why doesn't the United States demand the 
disarmament of the Israeli army in the border area? [passage 
omitted] 
  Fadlallah emphasized that the Resistance is not a card in 
anyone's hand, but benefits from Syrian and Iranian support, and 
indicated that Afghanistan, during Soviet occupation, benefited 
from the support of the United States, Europe, and the Gulf 
states. [passage omitted] 
  Fadlallah said the reason the United States has adopted a 
negative stance toward Lebanon's complaint to the Security 
Council is not that the Islamic Resistance has non-Lebanese 
connections, but that the Islamic Resistance represents a 
problem for U.S. policy in the region. All the Islamists 
represent a problem for the United States, which is acting not 
only to protect "Israel," but also to protect U.S. policy in the 
region. Just as there is an open war between the Islamists and 
"Israel," there is also open war between the Islamists and the 
U.S. policy worldwide. This is the secret of the hostile U.S. 
stances. 
  Asked about security cooperation between the PLO and 
"Israel," Fadlallah said: We do not trust the PLO. We possess 
documents on the PLO's relationship with Israel since 1982. We 
know the PLO has helped European intelligence agencies and has 
given them a lot of information on Islamists in Lebanon and many 
of the opponents of Western policy in the region. 
  Fadlallah expressed the fear that following the 
Israeli-Palestinian Agreement, Palestinian officials would 
coordinate and cooperate with Israeli intelligence to strike at 
Islamists and liberation movements in the region. He also 
expressed the fear that the self-rule accord will become a 
bridge across which the Israelis will infiltrate the Arab 
economy using the Palestinian factor, which can be a cover for 
the Israeli factor. He called on the Islamists and all those 
who reject the PLO policy to watch this so that the Palestinians 
will not become a tool in "Israel's" hand to weaken the 
Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic stances. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F>
Patrick Sabatier in Paris on 24 June -- first paragraph is 
LIBERATION introduction] 
  [Text] Yasir 'Arafat will be able to come and pray in 
Jerusalem: Yitzhaq Rabin gave this assurance on Friday [24 June] 
in interviews with two Israeli journalists, in the name of free 
access to places of worship, while stressing that "the problem 
is the date of such a trip, because of the security 
implications." At the same time, Israeli Deputy Foreign 
Minister, Yosi Beilin, in an interview with LIBERATION during a 
visit to Paris, confirmed the prime minister's statement, after 
having given a very positive report on Israeli-Palestinian 
relations. A member of the labor party's left wing, of which he 
is one of the most active cadres, Beilin also provides a 
progress report on the implementation of the Oslo agreement, of 
which he was one of the main authors. 
  [Sabatier] What have you to report, one month after Gaza and 
Jericho gained their autonomy? 
  [Beilin] We are very satisfied. The most important result is 
the significant drop in the level of violence. There may be 
people who want to resort to violence, and we cannot be sure 
there will not be such people in the future. However, the 
inhabitants of the West Bank are pleased with the new situation. 
They do not encourage those who want to violate the agreement 
and act against Israel. They do not provide terrorists with 
asylum, which has made terrorist activities more difficult than 
before. The people of Gaza go to the beach and to the 
restaurant, the curfew is over, and they feel that they can 
decide their future. An important change has been made. So far, 
autonomy has been a success. 
  [Sabatier] Is the Palestinian police force efficient and is 
it cooperating well with the Israeli Armed Forces? 
  [Beilin] I was hoping for this cooperation without being 
absolutely certain that it was possible. The fact that it has 
come is very encouraging. It proves that people accept the 
orders of the Palestinian police force, rather than proving the 
efficiency of this force. The joint patrols and committees have 
been very effective. The fact that we are talking to try and 
find solutions on the ground is one of the most important 
results of the agreement. It shows that, on both sides, we are 
capable of implementing what we have signed. 
  [Sabatier] What are the chances for success of the 
negotiations on the second stage of autonomy that start on 
Monday [date not specified]? 
  [Beilin] Our timetable is very clear. We must discuss a 
permanent solution before 4 May 1996 and implement it before 4 
May 1999. I am not sure that we will be talking about the 
second phase as of Monday. First of all, we have to see whether 
the Palestinians are ready for the elections that would pave the 
way to complete autonomy in Gaza and the whole of the West Bank, 
or if they prefer to wait and implement a partial devolution of 
authority in just five domains out of 19. This second option 
would mean two levels of autonomy. That is one possibility, but 
I would rather there were elections. 
  [Sabatier] Will the Israeli Army be redeployed outside of 
the 
urban centers in two months time, as planned? 
  [Beilin] That depends on the elections. The agreement 
provides for this redeployment to take place on the eve of the 
elections. If there are no elections, we will have to decide 
unilaterally whether or not we will do this. The feasibility of 
this redeployment does not pose a problem. The decision will 
depend on the level of violence... 
  [Sabatier] Negotiations for Gaza and Jericho took six 
months. 
Are you not afraid that the negotiations on the rest will not be 
much longer and harder, given the close proximity of the peoples? 
  [Beilin] The hardest thing has been achieved -- mutual 
recognition and direct dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. In 
addition, the Gaza-Jericho agreement has created a precedent and 
many problems have been resolved in this area. However, it is 
true that the geographical configuration is harder for the West 
Bank. 
  [Sabatier] Will you not be obliged to settle the issue of 
the 
colonies in this stage of negotiations? 
  [Beilin] We will only settle this issue in the framework of 
the final settlement. Despite the problems, the colonies will 
remain in place during the interim period. 
  [Sabatier] What about Jerusalem? Will you talk about it 
earlier than planned? 
  [Beilin] This will be the last point to be discussed, 
because 
it is the hardest point to settle. Anyone raising the issue now 
will pay dearly for it. It is better to settle the easy issues 
first, as we have always done in the past. 
  [Sabatier] Last year, you mentioned the possibility of 
granting some form of autonomy to the inhabitants of East 
Jerusalem. Are you still considering that? 
  [Beilin] Yes, but that is a personal idea of mine. We must 
keep Jerusalem a united municipality, under Israeli sovereignty 
and the capital of Israel. However, we cannot ignore the rights 
of non- Jewish people. From a religious point of view, there 
must be free access for all denominations and arrangements to 
satisfy them. On the political level, the Palestinians must be 
granted, just like the other communities, the right to 
administer the zones they live in and to elect representatives 
to a council placed under the authority of the municipality of 
Jerusalem and empowered to settle day-to-day issues. 
  [Sabatier] What will happen to the Palestinian institutions 
of Jerusalem? Do you want to close the "Orient House" 
(LIBERATION editor's note: PLO headquarters in East Jerusalem)? 
  [Beilin] That depends on what the "Orient House" is. If it 
serves as a community center for East Jerusalem, then there is 
no reason to close it down. However, if it becomes the center 
of Palestinian authorities for the Occupied Territories, we 
cannot tolerate it since this would be a violation of the 
agreement. 
  [Sabatier] Will the Palestinian leaders be able to visit 
Jerusalem, or will they be restricted to Gaza and Jericho? 
  [Beilin] At the current time, anyone who does not live in 
Jerusalem cannot go there. However, Rabin has just said this 
very morning that 'Arafat has the right to come and pray in 
Jerusalem, as he has said he wants to do, on condition that he 
coordinates this visit with the Israeli authorities. This is an 
important statement. 
  [Sabatier] Has the date for 'Arafat's return to Jericho been 
decided on? 
  [Beilin] Not as far as I know. 
  [Sabatier] Will you accept the presence of heads of state or 
foreign figures in Jericho for the event? 
  [Beilin] If it does not cause any violence or meet with 
opposition, why should we prevent anyone from going to Jericho 
on that day? However, is it wise to make such a big deal of 
this return? Is it not, at the end of the day, more important 
to make progress in the negotiations? At the moment, everyone 
is talking about 'Arafat's return rather than the negotiations... 
  [Sabatier] Why do you thank 'Arafat is delaying? 
  [Beilin] I hardly ever wonder about that, and quite frankly 
it is not at the top of my list of questions...

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Reconciliation Endeavors Thwarted by </F>
Prisoners and Terrorism Issues; Iran Postpones Its Official 
Delegation's Visit to Iraq for Second Time"] 
  [Text] Tehran, London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- It has been 
decided for the second time to postpone the visit scheduled to 
be made to Iraq by a high-level Iranian delegation amid new 
indications of a crisis in relations between Baghdad and Tehran. 
  The Iranian delegation was supposed to go to Iraq on 11 July 
to arrange for Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's 
visit to the Iraqi capital later the same month. 
  But two questions have emerged to derail reconciliation 
endeavors between the two countries. The first question 
concerns Iran's recent demand to the International Red Cross to 
look for more than 32,000 Iranian POW's believed to be still 
held in Iraqi camps. But Iraq vehemently denies these Iranian 
allegations, pointing out that Tehran raises this issue from 
time to time merely to prevent the normalization of relations 
between them. 
  However, the head of the Iranian committee entrusted with 
looking for missing persons says that he has "a mountain of 
evidence" supporting his claim that Iraq is using Iranians in 
compulsory work camps. 
  The committee's head, Mohammad 'Ali Nazran, said in a 
statement on Thursday [23 June] that the Red Cross "has full 
knowledge" of the Iranian position. 
  Iraq says that Iran fabricated the missing persons story "to 
conceal its lies during the war." 
  The Iraqis also claim that Iran lost in the war far more 
forces than the numbers stated in official statements. And 
that as a result, more than 32,000 killed in the war were 
classified as missing persons, and then later as POW's in Iraq. 
  The two sides have never released complete statistics of all 
their losses in the eight-year war. But some Western circles 
put the number of Iranian casualties at no less than 750,000, 
compared with 300,000 Iraqis. 
  The second question which has so far thwarted endeavors to 
achieve Iranian-Iraqi reconciliation concerns the terrorist 
actions the two sides are carrying out against one another. 
  At least 25 people were involved in the latest incident of 
this kind when a bomb exploded last Monday in Mashhad, the 
second largest Iranian city. 
  The Iranian Government holds the Mojahedi-e Khalq group, an 
armed opposition group supported by Iraq, responsible for the 
incident. 
  For its part, Baghdad accuses opposition Shiite groups of 
carrying out a number of terrorist actions in Iraq with 
financial and logistical support from Iran.

  [Text] Cairo, 27 Jun (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak 
returned to Cairo this afternoon following a two-day visit to 
the Libyan al-Jamahiriyah, during which he held intensive talks 
with Libyan revolution leader Brother Colonel Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi that dealt with the Libyan-Western crisis, 
"Lockerbie," and Egypt's efforts to find a solution to it. 
  The two leaders' talks also focused on developments in the 
Yemeni crisis, the Middle East peace talks developments, and the 
situation on all the tracks of the Arab-Israeli negotiations. 
The talks also dealt with developments in Africa, the outcome 
of the recent OAU summit in Tunis, and the consultations held by 
the African leaders on the summit sidelines. 
  The Egyptian and Libyan delegations also discussed bilateral 
relations and assessed their views of the decisions already made 
by the higher Egyptian-Libyan committee. The two sides 
discussed within this context the implementation of the project 
to extend by 170 kms the railroad between Musa'id and Tubruq. 
  The official delegation that accompanied the president 
during 
the visit returned with him.

  [Excerpts] Another round of extended talks was held this 
morning between the brother leader of the revolution and 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. [passage omitted] 
  JANA's correspondent in Sirte has reported that all aspects 
of bilateral cooperation between the two fraternal countries as 
well as other Arab and international topics of mutual interests 
were reviewed at this round of talks. 
  He added that the meeting also dealt with the situation in 
Yemen and the Egypt's role, which ought to protect Yemeni unity 
and face up to the colonialist schemes aimed at creating schism 
and weakening the Arab nation, beginning with Yemen and followed 
by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria, and the rest of Arab countries. 
In this respect, Egypt's leading role in the Arab homeland and 
in the world, given Egypt's weight, civilization, and huge 
sacrifices for Yemen in the sixties, was stressed. 
  As for Egypt's pan-Arab role, it was reiterated that the 
Israeli schemes were aiming at harming Egypt, because the 
program of the Zionist movement was aimed at establishing the 
so-called state of Israel from the Nile to the Euphrates. 
  As far as the Lockerbie problem was concerned, it was 
asserted that concocting such a problem was aimed at keeping 
Egypt busy with secondary issues and distracting it from playing 
its pan-Arab role.

<F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Ismail] </F>
  [Text] Islamabad -- President Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan 
Leghari Thursday [23 June] said the criticism of national 
institutions like armed forces and judiciary by the opposition 
leaders was "most unfortunate". 
  Responding to journalists questions at the inaugural 
function 
of Nathiagali Summer College here, the president said armed 
forces fully knew their responsibilities which they were 
fulfilling in accordance with the constitution and democratic 
system. 
  The president was happy with the role being played by the 
armed forces. When a journalist said that those elements 
criticising the armed forces wanted army's interference in 
politics, Leghari dispelled such impression saying "there was no 
danger of any such interference." 
  Asked about the need for a new legislation to check the 
criticism of the national institutions, including the armed 
forces, the president said: "Though the criticism was 
unfortunate but there are sufficient laws to deal with such 
criticism. However, if the government and legislators feel the 
need of more legislation, they can do the same", he pointed out. 
  The president said continued dialogue between the opposition 
and government were a must for the functioning of the democratic 
system, Leghari said in his capacity as the president of 
Pakistan. It was his duty to help create harmony between the 
opposition and government. "It is important for democratic 
system to function. There should be dialogue between the 
government and opposition all the times", the president said 
adding "it will be his endeavour to create conditions to enable 
the democratic process to function. 
  When reminded of the increased Indian defence budget, the 
president said: "we are also meeting Pakistan's defence needs". 
  Asked about the Indian's alleged plan of a "limited war" 
against Pakistan, the president said: "Armed forces, government 
and people of Pakistan are fully capable of defending their 
motherland". "We know how to defend our country and our forces 
are fully capable to safeguard our frontiers", he concluded. 
  Earlier, inaugurating the 19th International Nathiagali 
Summer College on physics and contemporary needs, the president 
said the freedom of thought and expression was a must for the 
promotion of science. A democratic order which guarantees 
freedom, provides a fertile soil for nurturing of science, he 
added. Repressive societies are not only intolerant of new ideas 
but in fact force creative minds to seek refugee in free 
societies which are more congenial and receptive to new ideas 
and initiatives, he added. He urged the scientists to strive to 
set up liberal and democratic traditions to discuss and debate 
the economic and technological problems facing the country and 
work out strategies to put Pakistan on a path of accelerated 
technological development. The president said systematic 
dialogue between leading scientists, technological experts, 
academicians and government functionaries had been initiated by 
him at the presidency and that he himself participated in the 
discussion. 
  Nuclear programme: The president said Pakistan would 
continue to pursue its peaceful nuclear programme. "We are 
against nuclear proliferation and have no intention to develop 
nuclear weapons. Our government is firmly committed to 
establishing an equitable, non-discriminatory and 
non-proliferation regime in South Asia. Leghari said Pakistan 
had put forward several proposals for NPT in the South Asia but 
unfortunately India had not responded positively. "Pakistan will 
welcome and cooperate on any future proposal but its security 
concerns must be taken into account," he added. 
  The president said Pakistan's nuclear programme was designed 
to help improve living standards of our people. We are in the 
process of setting up a major nuclear-based power plant at 
Chashma with the Chinese help. We will like to set up more 
nuclear power plants under IAEA safeguards, he added. 
  Leghari said Pakistan was determined to press into service 
science and technology to make progress and provide reasonable 
living standards to its people. For this purpose he said, the 
government had doubled the allocation for science and increased 
the education budget by 45 percent. But this is not sufficient 
and more resources will have to be diverted for human resource 
development, he maintained. 
  Earlier, Dr. Ishfaq Ahmed, chairman of Pakistan Atomic 
Energy 
Commission presented the address of welcome.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Dealing in Death"] </F>
  [Text] In their blind passion to make money, the Americans 
seem to have forgotten all norms of decency. They can go to any 
extent. The recent export of contaminated fertilisers to 
Bangladesh was not just an isolated incident or a mistake. The 
shipment which was returned by the Bangladesh authorities, was 
sent by a company quite notorious for such acts of covertly 
flouting international rules. It is not only the company which 
is responsible for exporting the deadly cargo to Bangladesh but 
the US government is also to be blamed. The role of the United 
States government in exporting poisonous food stuff and 
fertilisers can lead the people of this part of the world to 
believe that Washington deals in only death either by arms or by 
having the people use poisonous materials. 
  It is not a secret that food stuff and fertilisers are 
subjected to thorough checking before they are allowed to be 
marketed in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration 
of the United States boasts of very high standards in making 
sure that only those goods reach the shelf which are fit for 
human consumption. But the same standards are not applied to 
the goods which are destined for a Third World country. In fact 
every thing that is considered unfit for an American to consumer 
is allowed to be exported to Asia, Africa and South America. 
Does not this amount to killing innocent and poor people of 
these countries? What else can this lead us to believe? 
Killing seems to be part of the American way of life. 
  It is however astonishing that rulers in these parts of the 
world always remain oblivious to such criminal acts of the West. 
The US is not the only country engaged in this dirty business of 
exporting the rejected goods to the Third World. Recently a 
Danish company sold an environmentally hazardous plant to a 
Pakistan firm. But no action was taken by the Pakistani 
government. Technology is very important for development, but 
we must not allow the technological advanced countries to play 
havoc with our lives. These companies need to be blacklisted for 
any business with Pakistan. The government must remain alive to 
its duty of protecting the lives of its citizens. We cannot 
blame the Danish company for selling us a plant processing 
chlorine which has been built according to environmental 
specifications of the 1950s. It is we who are at fault. While 
buying the machinery the Pakistani firm have saved some money 
but it has certainly put many Pakistani lives at risk. It is 
the duty of the government to look into the matter and have the 
firm close down this factory. Such companies must also be 
punished for violating the environmental protection regulations. 
  The government of Pakistan needs to learn from the erstwhile 
East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, which promptly checked the 
consignment of contaminated fertiliser and sent it back to its 
country of origin. That is what the government of Pakistan must 
do.

  [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has urged the 
business community to keep the national interest uppermost and 
not to go on strike. The government's door for negotiations is 
open. They should talk to the minister of state for finance to 
remove differences, doubts, and suspicion as he is in charge of 
the budget. Talking to newsmen in Islamabad today, the prime 
minister said the people's government does not want to burden 
the poor and the middle class and it is for this reasons that 
taxes have been imposed on the upper class. She said the 
business community should take into account various incentives 
and concessions given in the budget. In this connection, she 
referred to withdrawal of import duty and reduction in tariff 
rates. However, she declared, the government will not succumb 
to any pressure or blackmail. She said the government has taken 
measures aimed at reducing dependence on bank loans. She said 
for the 1993-94 budget, 60 billion rupees were borrowed from the 
State Bank. In the new budget, bank borrowing has been 
curtailed to 15 billion rupees only. This will reduce the 
budget deficit and enhance industrialization. The prime 
minister said the business community is not opposed to the 
budgetary measures, rather they are averse to the government's 
decision to file wealth tax returns along with income tax 
returns. She said in the United Kingdom, India, and other 
countries, if someone is found concealing his income he has to 
pay 10 times the evaded amount. If the business community comes 
to the negotiations, then we can start with penalties four times 
of the amount evaded and would gradually increase it to 10 
times. But, if they carry on with their strike call, then we 
will enforce penalties 10 times the amount at once. The prime 
minister said the government wants everybody to pay tax 
according to capacity because the prevalent system taxes the 
poor but does not bring the rich into the tax net. She said the 
government has initiated a moral crusade against tax evasion. 
She said: 
  [Begin Bhutto recording] I do not believe the community's 
strike is to going to be effective. I believe that they are 
going to strike and it will peter out. And I believe that the 
reforms that we have introduced are necessary for transforming 
Pakistan into a modern nation state. We cannot be a nation of 
borrowers. We cannot be a nation which lives beyond our means. 
We cannot be a nation that goes on increasing our deficit and 
paying our government salaries through borrowing. (?It has) to 
stop. And what we have to do is generate employment and reduce 
inflation for which we have taken steps. [end recording] 
  The minister of state for finance, Makhdum Shahabuddin, has 
said the claim of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry [FPCCI] that the government will suffer a loss of 18 
billion rupees per day if the federation's demands are not met 
resulting in a two-day strike is false, exaggerated, and 
alarmist. In a statement issued in Islamabad today, Makhdum 
Shahabuddin said it is clear that the strike, the success of 
which is questionable, will not affect agriculture, the 
principal productive sector of the economy, or energy or mining. 
He said even if it is assumed that the entire manufacturing and 
trade sector shuts down, which is virtually impossible, the loss 
to the economy would not amount to around 1.5 billion rupees per 
day. These irresponsible estimates of the FPCCI are meant to 
alarm the public, cause panic, and pressurize the government 
into taking action which may not be in the best interest of the 
country. Makhdum Shahabuddin said the federation is not serving 
the true interests of its constituents or the country by 
resorting to confrontation, alarmist predictions, campaign to 
break the law, and obstructing constructive dialogue on the 
budget between the government and trade and industry.

  [Text] A strike is being observed today in some parts of 
country at the call of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry [FPCCI] against nonacceptance of their 
budget proposals by the government. In Karachi, industrial 
units and main shopping centers are closed. However, public 
transport and private vehicles are plying as usual. Most of the 
main shopping centers and markets in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and 
Peshawar are closed. 
  However, the minister for commerce speaking in the National 
Assembly said a number of factories in Sialkot, Naushahra, 
Gujrat, and Sindh are not observing the strike. The minister 
for commerce, Chaudhary Ahmad Mukhtar, has again asked the 
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry to call 
off the strike and resume talks with the government about their 
demands. Replying to a point of order by Haji Mohammad Nawaz 
Khokar in the National Assembly today, the commerce minister 
said that the government during talks with representatives of 
FPCCI wanted to evolve some package. However, they continued 
their threatening posture saying that if their demands were not 
accepted, they would go on strike. He said they wanted taxation 
rules and laws of their choice and were trying to dictate to the 
government. He said there were some politically motivated 
people who raised slogans and misbehaved during the talks.

  [Text] Partial strike was observed throughout the country 
today on the call of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry against the budgetary proposals. Most of the business 
concern belonging to big businessmen and industrialists remained 
closed. However, small markets and shopping centers generally 
remained open. Petroleum dealers and transporters did not pay 
heed to the strike call. Fruit and vegetable markets, 
restaurants, utility stores, mohallah [petty] shops, and general 
stores and vendors also continued their normal business 
activities. Some traders continued their business with their 
shutters half closed. The stock exchanges of the country also 
remained open as usual, but trading was poor. The industrial 
sector responded to the strike call as most of the units 
suspended their activities. Most of the small traders condemned 
the strike and said the big businessmen always fleece masses 
with a big profit margin. They should make some sacrifice for 
the nation and avoid creating problems for the people. They 
were of the view that the strike call is politically motivated 
as these elements wanted to create hurdles for the government 
which is making efforts to streamline the country's economy in 
order to provide relief to the common man. [words indistinct] 
some traders told our representative that they are not in favor 
of the strike, but kept their premises closed for fear of 
Chamber's desperadoes. They said the strike is not in the 
national interest.

  [Text] Partial strike by the business community continued 
throughout the country for the second day today. The call for 
the strike was given by the Pakistan Federation of Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry to protest against certain taxation 
proposals in the federal budget. Our correspondents from major 
cities and towns say that as compared to yesterday, most of 
small traders today carried out their business. The impact of 
strike was however witnessed in major shopping centers, big 
business establishments, commercial houses, and industrial 
estates. Our representatives say most of small traders opened 
their premises in the morning, but under pressure from chamber's 
representatives they pulled down their shutters later in the 
day. Like yesterday, transporters and petroleum dealers 
remained averse to the strike call and carried on their normal 
activities. Fruit and vegetable markets remained open and 
normal rush of buyers was visible. The life was normal as 
strike did not affect the common man who was least concerned by 
the shutdown in the major markets and shopping centers.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "Arab Silence Over Israeli Report on the </F>
Massacre of the Age"] 
  [Text] We believed that this or that Arab capital would 
react to the report of the Israeli investigation commission on 
the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which acquitted the Israeli 
government, the Israeli Army, and settlers of the killing of 
defenseless Palestinians who were performing their Ramadan 
Friday prayers. 
  However, our belief was in vain, because the Israeli report 
on the massacre of the age was received with complete silence. 
This despite the fact that the report contains false 
allegations and distorted facts. It also defends the crime of 
the settler, who committed the crime through cooperation with 
members of the army, by saying that he was insane when he 
carried out the act. 
  The Israeli government is not innocent of the crime in which 
scores of innocent children and old men were killed. It was 
able, as usual, through its arrogance, to reverse facts and to 
charge people, who are without conscience or ethics, with 
writing a report which is far away from reality. Meanwhile, the 
Arab capitals received this report with silence, as if they 
approve of its contents. 
  Arab silence over Israeli crimes will encourage the Rabin 
government not only to continue its crimes but also to impose 
whatever it wants in the peace process. Thus, it will achieve 
its ambitions and reach -- through the peace which it will 
impose by deception -- what it failed to reach in its wars with 
the Arabs. 
  The Arabs must place at the top of their priorities in the 
peace process ending the Israeli crimes and the Israeli strategy 
which is based on aggression and expansion. These two items are 
as important as restoring the usurped Arab rights and respecting 
the rights of others. 
  The objective of establishing a lasting, just, and 
comprehensive peace should include the conditions that will 
enable the coming generations to live in security and stability. 
Otherwise, talk about peace will be nonsense and media uproar, 
which has no basis on the ground.

  [Excerpts] House of Representatives Speaker Tahir al-Masri 
has stated that His Majesty King Husayn's recent visit to 
Washington constitutes one of his majesty's most important 
visits abroad in terms of timing, content, and results both in 
the local and regional arenas. [passage omitted] 
  In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency, al-Masri added 
that his majesty believes that cohesion on the internal front, 
overcoming economic difficulties, and promoting Jordan's 
democratic, economic, and development march cannot be ignored in 
any political move and that Israel's recognition of Jordan's 
sovereignty over its usurped territories, as well as returning 
its full water rights, will be useful for our Arab brothers in 
their negotiations on the other tracks. If the Arab rights are 
recognized on their tracks--a matter that has taken place on the 
Jordanian track--then this principle would apply to other tracks 
and all aspects of Arab rights. 
  He also said that the House of Representatives always 
supports any accomplishment and policy that enables Jordan to 
restore its rights, promote its development, and achieve the 
utmost Arab coordination with the other Arab brothers in order 
to reach a concerted comprehensive solution. 
  Al-Masri added: I understand the extent of doubts and fears 
of many of the sons of our people, but stagnation and the lack 
of movement in the international arena, as well as allowing 
fears and points of weakness to overwhelm confidence and the 
points of strength in the Arab Islamic society in Jordan and 
abroad, will only lead to more Zionist control of the region and 
the international circles. Jordan's move toward negotiations 
and peace issues, he added, has not come in a vacuum, has not 
been hasty, and will, with God's help and King Husayn's wisdom, 
pursue this course to achieve the goals in which our loyal 
Jordanians believe and for which they are working.

<F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Hayim Shibi] </F>
  [Text] "In Washington, we agreed in principle on a meeting 
with Rabin," Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said 
in a special interview to YEDI'OT AHARONOT, summing up King 
Husayn's visit to Washington. 
  The next move the Clinton administration would very much 
like 
to see taking place in Washington soon is a Rabin-Husayn-Clinton 
meeting on the White House lawn. Such an encounter would also 
serve to inform the Syrians that they are running out of time. 
  Al-'Anani, who is close to the king, willingly replied to 
YEDI'OT AHARONOT's questions. 
  [Al-'Anani] The principle has been agreed on. What is left 
now is to find the right date. King Husayn told his hosts that 
he would meet with Rabin -- or with any other leader from the 
top Israeli Government echelons -- before a peace agreement is 
signed. Naturally, we expect progress to be made in issues 
pertaining to borders, water, security, and an entire series of 
topics that will be discussed later. 
  [Shibi] Will we see Israeli ministers traveling to Amman to 
sign trade agreements in a year's time? Israeli civilians 
visiting there? Will you host the international economic 
conference? 
  [Al-'Anani] To begin with, a preparatory conference will be 
held in Morocco in November. That will be the dress rehearsal 
for the events in Amman. If the debates make quick progress, I 
think everything you mentioned will come to pass. 
  [Shibi] What message of hope can you convey to Israelis 
today? 
  [Al-'Anani] I hope the talks we are about to begin will bear 
fruit. 
  [Shibi] Will there be talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat? 
  [Al-'Anani] Not necessarily. We have not decided on the 
final venue. There are other options, and we are checking them. 
The meeting may be held on both sides of the border in the 
'Arava, with one negotiating team on the Israeli side and 
another on the Jordanian. 
  [Shibi] Does Jordan accept Peres' formula according to which 
Jerusalem will be open in terms of religion but closed in the 
political sense? 
  [Al-'Anani] We have received no detailed Israeli plan, but 
we are encouraged by what has been said so far. We will need to 
receive a detailed plan, and then we will respond accordingly. 
  [Shibi] Are you satisfied with the aid you are about to 
receive from the Americans? 
  [Al-'Anani] We have launched a process, and we encountered 
great new understanding on the part of the administration. They 
now understand Jordan's position, they appreciate our part in 
the peace process, and they are willing to support us 
accordingly. 
  [Shibi] What did you get? 
  [Al-'Anani] We were told to submit our requests, which will 
be screened by the authoritative ranks in State and other 
departments. 
  [Shibi] Are you not apprehensive about the Islamic 
opposition in Jordan? 
  [Al-'Anani] Each of us -- both Jordan and Israel -- has its 
own public and constituency to deal with. [end al-'Anani] 
  It has been learned that Husayn asked Clinton for a $700,000 
debt write-off. Clinton promised "that the request would be 
favorably examined."

  [Text] The Russian ambassador to Jordan has described as 
very constructive Jordan's role in Middle East peacemaking. Mr. 
Aleksandr Saltanov said the Jordanian role will contribute to 
pushing forward the peace process in the region. 
  In an interview with the Jordan News Agency, he said Jordan, 
under the wise leadership of his majesty the king, plays a 
central role in the peace process. The Russian envoy said the 
progress on the Jordanian-Israeli track and the talks cannot be 
regarded as a separate peace deal. 
  He said this achievement should be accompanied by progress 
on 
other tracks as well. The Russian ambassador explained that 
when the whole peace process began back in Madrid in 1991, it 
was clear that unilateral tracks were not the same as regards 
the depth of problems, and so, he said, it is natural that 
progress on each track depends on what problems it faces. 
  And speaking on Jordan's water rights, Mr. Saltanov stressed 
that the water issue is one of the most complicated problems in 
the Middle East. And he went on to say that solving the water 
resources problem and making sure that each party attains its 
own water rights should have priority in negotiations between 
Arab parties and Israel.

  [Text] The deputies of the Islamic Action Front [IAF] have 
reiterated their principled rejection of negotiations with the 
Zionist enemy. 
  In a statement on the resumption of the Jordanian-Israeli 
negotiations in Washington and the agreements signed by the 
trilateral Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee, the deputies said 
they think the sub-agendas reached in Washington reflect a 
Jordanian retreat from the constant principles stressed time and 
again by Jordanian officials. These principles stipulate 
rejecting a unilateral peace, adhering to the Islamic and Arab 
character of Jerusalem, and the right of refugees to return to 
their country and territories from which they were expelled by 
the usurper Jews. 
  The statement warned against making the same mistake as the 
Palestinian negotiator by throwing himself into the lap of the 
Zionist entity. It also warned of falling into the trap of 
Jewish deceit. 
  The statement also asserted the IAF's condemnation and 
rejection of the approach being pursued by the Jordanian 
Government contrary to the attitudes of the Jordanian people, 
who reject all these concessions. The opinion of the Jordanian 
people and their representatives of the negotiations was not 
sought, even though these negotiations target their land, 
destiny, and the future of their generations. 
  The statement added that the agendas stemming from the 
meetings of the trilateral committee represent clear recognition 
of the Zionist entity and its right to security, stability, as 
well as to the region's waters, resources, and chaste land. 
These agendas also reflect recognition of international borders 
and joint maps which we teach to our sons on which the State of 
Israel appears. This is what the Jews have been dreaming of for 
thousands of years. 
  The Jordanian Democratic Popular Unity Party and the 
Jordanian People's Democratic Party, HASHD, have also issued a 
statement in which they said the sub-agendas divide the Security 
Council resolution, give Israel the right to interpret this 
resolution the way it wants, and abandon the principle of a 
comprehensive solution on the basis of land for peace, regaining 
the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, and the 
national rights of the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese people in 
the occupied Arab territories. 
  The statement said these sub-agendas confirm beyond any 
shadow of a doubt that relinquishing sovereignty issues is 
continuing. This applies to waters, security, and territory. 
Normalization has also started by transferring the negotiations 
to the field without Israel making a commitment to implement 
Security Council Resolution 242, especially with regard to 
withdrawal from all the 1967-occupied territories, including 
Jerusalem. 
  The statement called for canceling the Jordanian-Israeli 
agenda as an indispensable step to restructure the negotiating 
process on foundations that truly respond to the resolutions of 
international legitimacy. 
  The statement urged the people, their institutions, and 
political forces to stand up to the the agreements of submission 
and normalization to preserve the independence and sovereignty 
of the country. 
  The Jordanian Arab Constitutional Front Party also issued a 
statement in which it said: At a time when we were expecting to 
consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination between our 
beloved Jordan and fraternal Syria to overcome this serious, 
decisive stage of the peace talks -- to which the Arabs were 
dragged since the Madrid conference -- and after their positions 
were weakened by the Oslo accord, the new Jordanian position to 
resume the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations in Washington came as 
a destructive turning point for the Arab position on its 
stronger Damascus-Amman-Beirut front. 
  The front said that our Jordanian people were surprised at 
this dangerous turning point which was peddled while the people 
were preoccupied with what preceded the recent cabinet reshuffle 
and while they were listening to their statements about further 
coordination and cohesion between Syria and Jordan. They, 
themselves, have stated that this coordination enhances the Arab 
negotiating stand to a level that can force the occupiers to 
submit to the international legitimacy resolutions and withdraw 
from all the occupied Arab territories. 
  The new stand of the Jordanian Government, whose head had 
led 
the negotiations before he assumed the premiership, constitutes 
an imminent threat to Jordan and the Palestinian cause and harms 
the cooperation and coordination between the Arab brothers in 
Syria and Lebanon. 
  The statement added that it is as ridiculous as it is 
lamentable to justify the Jordanian policy of rushing toward 
capitulation to the occupier on the pretext of fear that 
Jordan's role will be marginalized. What role do we fear will 
be marginalized, and what national rights will we save by giving 
in to the will of the usurpers of Palestine and to the pressure 
of those who adopt two yardsticks, those whose pressure and 
interference are rejected and condemned even by Haiti? 
  Our Jordanian people are well aware that when those who 
flout 
their will and encroach on their dignity speak about Jordan's 
interest, they mean only their personal interests. For these 
people, Jordan is a plantation and not a homeland, and the 
Jordanians subjects and not citizens. 
  The Jordanian government's new policy will lead us to an 
inevitable national catastrophe. Jordan, in terms of people and 
land, has no interest in disavowing its brothers. On the 
contrary, its interest lies in aligning and coordinating its 
steps and policies with those of its brothers in Syria. The 
statement called on all political parties and figures, and on 
national groupings and institutions to decisively and 
courageously ward off this catastrophe to save Jordan from what 
is being planned for it in the dark mazes of deviation and 
humiliating capitulation. 
  In a statement it issued on the Jordanian-Israeli agreement, 
the central committee of Fatah-the Uprising said: 
  1. The agreement is in response to the Zionist-U.S. 
conditions and pressures on Jordan, which have escalated since 
the announcement of the Oslo conspiracy. 
  2. It is in response to the Zionist-American enemy's efforts 
to consolidate the liquidatory Oslo-Cairo conspiracy and to 
incorporate Jordan and the agent authority in Gaza and Jericho 
into the Zionist vital space and its security and economic 
program called the economic triangle. This means an official 
Jordanian participation in this hostile U.S.-Zionist project. 
  3. The agreement is a new U.S. and Zionist penetration of 
the 
Arab nation's front and has weakened and confused the opposition 
forces within our nation, thus facilitating separate dealings 
with each of Syria and Lebanon. 
  4. The agreement impairs and violates the nation's security 
and its national interests and constants, not to mention that it 
greatly harms the nation's present and future. 
  5. The agreement greatly harms the Jordanian people's 
political, economic, and social achievements. 
  6. By acknowledging the mandate borders with the Zionist 
entity, the Jordanian government recognizes the enemy's 
occupation and usurpation of Palestine, harms our people's 
national rights, and abandons Jerusalem's Arab affiliation.

  [Text] Information Minister Dr. Jawad al-'Anani has 
stressed Jordan's full readiness to become a positive factor in 
the endeavor to end Arab bloodshed in sisterly Yemen through 
cooperation with any Arab side or in any agreed-on arrangements 
because Yemen is an Arab and Islamic state. He said continued 
fighting in Yemen will result in a long destructive war, 
particularly because there are previous examples of this in the 
Arab world. 
  Asked by an AL-DUSTUR correspondent in New York about the 
failure of Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general to 
Yemen, in his mission to bring all Yemeni parties together, 
al-'Anani said: Jordan has always worked to safeguard the unity 
of sisterly Yemen, which it freely opted to do. At the 
beginning of the crisis, the brothers in Yemen asked His Majesty 
King Husayn to embark on mediation to spare Yemeni blood. This 
was achieved, thanks to His Majesty King Husayn's efforts, and 
the accord document was signed in Amman to safeguard Yemen unity. 
  Al-'Anani said Brahimi's mission has not ended yet, adding 
that he will present his report to the UN secretary general to 
be discussed. Therefore, al-'Anani added, it is difficult to 
say that his mission has failed. 
  The information minister noted that Jordan supports any Arab 
endeavor and will attend any meeting called by the Arab League 
to discuss events in Yemen. He said Jordan appeals to all 
Yemeni parties to stop fighting and to resort to diplomacy to 
save Yemen from suffering and civil war. He affirmed Jordan's 
readiness to participate in resolving differences, provided that 
the fighting stops.

  [Text] Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi and Speaker of the 
House of Representatives Tahir al-Masri today met separately at 
the Parliament building with a visiting Yemeni parliamentary 
delegation led by Deputy Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi. Details 
in the following report by our parliamentary affairs 
correspondent: 
  Mr. al-Lawzi told the Yemeni lawmakers that, led by His 
Majesty King Husayn, Jordan has sought with all sincerity to 
ensure a reconciliation that advanced peace and unity in Yemen 
in the best interests of the country's people. Jordan, he 
added, has carried and continues to carry the concerns and 
causes of the Arab nation, particularly the Palestinian cause. 
Al-Lawzi emphasized that His Majesty King Husayn is giving the 
cause of Yemen top priority. He recalled the meeting held in 
Amman by Yemen's leaders and representatives who signed the 
accord document that has won widespread support throughout the 
Arab world. 
  We have been deeply pained and distressed by the fact that 
no 
sooner had the Amman meeting ended than blood began to flow in 
Yemen and dialogue and understanding gave way to war, he said. 
The Senate speaker also recalled distressing events in 
Palestine, the Gulf, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, and elsewhere. 
  For his part, Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Kibsi, the head of the 
Yemeni delegation, emphasized that the Yemeni people understand 
Jordan's stand on Yemen's unity. The delegation is visiting 
Jordan to benefit from its rich experience in order to maintain 
Yemen's unity, which is held by the country's people to be their 
destiny. The war now raging in Yemen, he added, is not one 
between north and south or between the General People's Congress 
and the Socialist Party. It is a war pitting constitutional 
legitimacy against a party that has defied this legitimacy, in 
other words, a conflict between advocates of and deviationists 
from national unity. Al-Kibsi said that by sponsoring the 
accord document, which offered a political way out of potential 
hostilities, Amman lit a candle of joy. He noted that all 
Yemeni political forces showed up at the signing ceremony and 
put their signatures to the document. Every Yemeni citizen -- 
from the far left to the far right -- appreciates that Amman is 
anxious for Yemen to retain its unity, said al-Kibsi. 
  Al-Kibsi delivered a message from Mr. 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, 
the 
speaker of Yemen's House of Representatives, to Mr. al-Lawzi. 
  In his meeting with the Yemeni parliamentarians, al-Masri 
emphasized that, led by His Majesty King Husayn, Jordan headed 
the effort to heal the rift in Yemen. Our stance in Jordan 
toward fraternal Yemen is known and has not changed, al-Masri 
said. He said he hoped the hostilities and bloodletting would 
halt so that Yemen may stay united in fulfillment of the will of 
the country's people. 
  Al-Kibsi told al-Masri he appreciated and took pride in the 
interest Jordan's king, government, and people have taken in 
Yemen's unity since it was declared. He noted that as soon as 
differences in Yemen emerged, Jordan and King Husayn moved to 
smooth over these differences and then set up the meeting that 
saw the signing of the accord document bearing the clear 
fingerprints of Jordan. 
  Al-Kibsi handed Mr. al-Masri a message from Mr. al-Ahmar.

  [Text] Acting Prime Minister Dhuqn al-Hindawi has asserted 
that Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Husayn, 
placed the Yemeni issue at the top of its priorities, both 
before and after the pledge and accord document was reached. 
  During his meeting at the Prime Ministry today with the 
Yemeni parliamentary delegation headed by deputy Muhammad 
'Abdallah al-Kibsi, al-Hindawi said that all Jordanians want a 
return to national dialogue and a cease-fire so that fraternal 
Yemen can emerge from its crisis safe and healthy and direct its 
energies and resources toward progress and prosperity. The Arab 
nation, he said, more than ever needs its sons' energies and 
solidarity in a world of cooperation and blocs to achieve the 
interests of nations and all humanity. 
  The acting prime minister was then briefed by the guest 
delegation on the current crisis in Yemen and ways of ending the 
infighting among the sons of the one people and returning to the 
unity's constitution, which was endorsed by the people, so that 
unified Yemen can remain an asset for the Arab nation and a 
factor for progress and development in it. 
  In a statement to journalists following the meeting, 
al-Kibsi 
said: We have accepted a cease-fire and a return to dialogue 
within the framework of unity. He added: It is untrue that we 
want to impose unity by force. Rather, we support legitimacy 
and the Yemeni people's will and options regarding their unity 
and democratic policy. He pointed out that during the meeting, 
Jordan stressed its firm and principled position toward the 
Yemeni crisis and called for halting the infighting and 
returning to dialogue and negotiations.

  [Text] The Islamic Action Front [IAF] and the Pan-Arab 
Action Front [PAAF] have held a news conference in which they 
discussed developments in the national, Arab, and international 
arenas. IAF Secretary General Ishaq al-Farhan read out a joint 
statement issued by the two parties. 
  The statement expresses both parties' concern over 
violations 
of citizens' liberties, guaranteed by the noble Islamic 
shari'ah, safeguarded by the Constitution, and imposed by the 
state of democracy adopted by our people. The statement deals 
with the following forms of violation: 
  -- The detention of citizens for months without being 
referred to civilian courts, as well as their exposure up to now 
to psychological and physical torture. 
  The statement adds: "The state organs still insist on 
preventing the people's deputies from visiting the prisons, 
particularly the General Intelligence prison, to acquaint 
themselves with conditions inside prisons, after reports have 
leaked regarding practices incompatible with man's dignity and 
rights. 
  The statement calls for an immediate release of all 
prisoners 
and for compensating them for the harm they have suffered, 
particularly those who were taken from schools and consequently 
missed their school year. 
  The statement also deals with restrictions imposed on the 
activities of political parties and their members. It says: 
"We feel the government does not treat the parties as national 
institutions established in accordance with the constitution and 
the law. Instead, it casts doubts on them, restricts their 
activity, and besieges them in order to prove that the party 
experience in Jordan has failed." 
  The statement condemns administrative officers' insistence 
on 
preventing party activities, depending on an unfair 
interpretation of the law. They therefore prevent receptions, 
festivals, and seminars in public halls and squares as if they 
were telling the parties not to meet over a national cause. 
They also watch members of some parties and press them to 
resign from their parties, after their memberships have become 
obstacles preventing their professional stability and promotions 
while the government shows bias toward other pro-government 
parties and supports the party that constantly praises it." 
  The statement refers to restrictions on the ulema and the 
educational institutions and says the government prevents them 
from playing the role they used to play even under martial law. 
The clearest example of that is that the former education 
minister's decision not to allow the use of school facilities 
during summer holidays and his cancellation of previous 
approvals by education directors." 
  The statement adds: "The schools, which were built at the 
expense of the people's bread, should be centers of 
enlightenment in the region and should be used to serve the 
local community through educational and social programs with the 
approval, help, and supervision of competent authorities. We 
view the education minister's decision as determination to 
deprive students from educational programs, chief of which are 
plans for students to learn the Koran by heart. This activity 
is conducted by the Society for the Preservation of the Koran, 
licensed by the Ministry of Culture, in order to compensate for 
the Education Ministry's failure to carry out this task." 
  Regarding interference concerning passports and restrictions 
on citizens who want to travel abroad, the statement says: 
"Every citizen has the right to have a passport and to travel 
abroad and return to the homeland." 
  Regarding the new government, the statement says: "Our two 
parties also criticize the way the government was formed under 
these critical circumstances." It adds: "The prime minister 
who was asked to reshuffle the cabinet did not consult the 
parties and the parliamentary blocs. Therefore, the 
government's makeup was intended to satisfy certain sides at the 
expense of the national interests. So, the number of ministers 
was the largest in Jordan's history. It is enough for us to 
know that it includes eight ministers without portfolios. We 
also criticize the government because its makeup is aimed at 
weakening the opposition in the House of Representatives by 
securing an additional number of deputies in order to go ahead 
with plans to sign a unilateral reconciliation agreement with 
the Zionist enemy." 
  The statement asks the government to convene an 
extraordinary session to present a statement to the House of 
Representatives, especially since only seven ministers have 
remained in the government that had received a slight majority 
by the House of Representatives. 
  The statement emphasizes the following: 
  1. The Palestinian people's right to practice their 
legitimate right to resist in order to attain their objectives 
of liberation, return, and sovereignty on all their homeland. 
Hence, any attempt to deny them this right is an aggression 
against a natural right, and they have the right to reject and 
resist it. 
  2. The unity of our Palestinian people is a sacred unity 
that should be preserved and protected from any encroachment. 
Hence, we consider any encroachment on the unity of the 
Palestinian people as prohibited and criminal. 
  The statement adds: "As for the Jordanian arena, after a 
suspension [of the peace negotiations] caused by the siege on 
the Gulf of Aqaba, the past two weeks witnessed unnatural 
acceleration that looks like a race with the Palestinian 
negotiator. Sub-agendas on borders, security, and water have 
been signed tackling details that our two parties believe 
represent a deviation from the so-called national constants that 
focussed on a comprehensive solution, the return of Jerusalem, 
and solving the problem of refugees. 
  On normalization of relations with the Zionist enemy, the 
statement says: The Arab regimes, including the PLO, continue 
normalization measures through secret and open meetings and 
bilateral and collective meetings. These meetings were held in 
several Arab countries including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and 
Morocco. If what has been announced is bad, undoubtedly what is 
hidden is worse. 
  The Jordanian government has recently embarked on a major 
normalization step through the U.S.-Jordanian-Israeli meeting. 
By this step, the Jordanian government overlooked Madrid and 
Arab coordination with the cordon states. It relinquished its 
declared constants on the Palestine question, including the West 
Bank and holy Jerusalem, considering its problem with the enemy 
no more than the land the enemy occupied to the east of the 
river, the water problem, and the refugee problem. 
  The statement also speaks about the Arab and international 
developments, and the situation in Yemen. It says: "The Arab 
masses and their pan-Arab and Islamic forces had been delighted 
by the propensity of Yemen in the north and south toward unity, 
shura, and democracy, and viewed this as a manifestation of the 
Arab-Islamic future" 
  On the internal situation in Egypt, the statement says: "Our 
two parties have more than once expressed their concern for the 
violence that is going in beloved Egypt. Violence only begets 
violence, and we emphasized our condemnation of all sorts of 
violence regardless of the parties that are practicing it. We 
are confident that the ideal solution for the cycle of violence 
is through enhancing liberties, and entrenching shura and 
democracy." 
  On the siege imposed on Iraq, the statement condemns the 
continuation of the siege, and urged the Arab and Islamic forces 
and parties to do all they can to end this unjust siege, 
starting with the neighboring states. 
  It calls for more efforts to unify the position of the 
pan-Arab and Islamic forces on a specific program for lifting 
the siege and ending the harm to our people in Iraq and 
unleashing their capabilities in the interest of our Arab nation 
and the Islamic peoples.

<F P=106> [By a JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- The Islamic Action Front (IAF), suggesting 
that the government is operating without a vote of confidence 
from the Lower House of Parliament, has urged Prime Minister 
'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali to seek the confidence of the House on 
the basis of a new policy statement. 
  If Dr. al-Majali fails to obtain a mandate from the House, a 
"national unity" government representing all shades of the 
political spectrum should be formed, the IAF said in a statement 
Thursday [16 June]. 
  The IAF said the change of more than half of members of the 
Cabinet in the recent reshuffle left only seven ministers who 
enjoy "the weak mandate" the government won from the House when 
it sought its confidence in December, Accordingly, the 
government should seek the confidence of the House anew, it said. 
  Criticising the government for changing the Elections Law 
and 
dissolving the 11th Parliament last year, the front charged Dr. 
al- Majali reshuffled the Cabinet instead of fully changing it 
to avoid a confidence session in the House. 
  The front, which has 16 deputies in the House, also charged 
that the government reversed an earlier decision to exclude 
lawmakers from the executive authority in order to win support 
for its drive to conclude a "surrender" treaty with Israel. 
  "Deputies who withheld confidence from the government of Dr. 
al- Majali but joined it in the reshuffle" also came under fire 
from the front, which questioned "how those deputies would 
support the policies of the government while their no confidence 
vote in it indicates they reject the policies?" 
  Deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah had cast a no confidence 
vote in the government, but he agreed to join it as minister for 
state and minister of education. 
  The reshuffle, which brought 18 new ministers to an expanded 
31-member Cabinet, also portends the government's 
underestimation of the role of political parties as they were 
not consulted about it, said the front, whose deputies remain in 
the opposition. 
  The reshuffle also caused confusion to the House and its 
blocs, which were kept out of the negotiations over the 
reshuffle, said the front. 
  The front demanded that lawmakers and political parties and 
activists cooperate to "consolidate national unity and...prevent 
normalisation with the Zionist enemy." 
  The front also urged lawmakers to work against the 
"marginalisation" of the role of the House. Many deputies 
expressed discontent with the government for failing to consult 
with parliamentary blocs before introducing the reshuffle and 
vowed to reassert the role of the legislature in the government 
structure.

  [Text] Amman--AL-DUSTUR--A delegation from the Islamic 
Action Front [IAF] and the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAF] has 
visited the North Korean Embassy to deliver a message expressing 
their solidarity with the North Korean's resistance to the U.S. 
policy aimed at strangulating the northern part of Korea, 
controlling the Pacific Ocean, and creating appropriate 
circumstances for marketing old U.S. weapons in the region. 
  The North Korean ambassador expressed the appreciation of 
his 
embassy and government for the stand of IAF and the PAF. He 
stressed the firm Korean position in confronting U.S. threats. 
  Included in the delegation were Deputy Hamzah Mansur, 
spokesman for the IAF deputies bloc; Muhammad al-Zu'bi, PAF 
secretary general; Deputy Doctor Bassam al-'Umush; Naji 'Allush; 
Deputy 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabr; Ahmad Ibrahim; and Engineer 'Ali 
Abu-al-Sukkar. 
  In a separate development, seven Jordanian parties issued a 
statement of solidarity with North Korea against the onslaught 
being waged against it. 
  The statement says: "Contrasting with this U.S. plotting 
against the DPRK concerning nuclear inspection issues is the 
imperialist states' full collusion and suspect silence toward 
the government of Israel, which is being turned into a nuclear 
base far away from international inspection in the Middle East. 
Moreover, Israel's military arsenal is constantly beefed up, 
thus violating the international will and peoples' interests." 
  The seven Jordanian parties called for a campaign of 
solidarity with the Korean people. 
  The parties that signed the statement are: The Jordanian 
Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian Democratic 
Progressive Party, the Jordanian Communist Party, the Jordanian 
Socialist Democratic Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th party, the 
Jordanian Arab Masses Party, and the Jordanian Arab 
Constitutional Front Party.

  [Text] Amman (PETRA)--School curiccula in the occupied west 
Bank, including the self-rule Jericho area will continue to 
follow the Jordanian educational curricula while schools in Gaza 
Strip will follow the Egyptian system, according to Yasir 'Amr, 
head of the Palestine Higher Educational Department of the 
Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). 
  "But with help from the United Nations Educational 
Scientific 
and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), there will be a gradual 
reconciliation between the two systems, said Mr. 'Amr who has 
been appointed minister of higher education under the national 
Palestine authority. 
  In a statement Sunday [19 June], Mr. 'Amr said that the 
Palestinians are determined to erase the last traces of the 
Israeli occupation of over 27 years, and this can be achieved 
through an efficient educational system and in close cooperation 
with Jordan and Egypt. 
  Referring to the educational system in the occupied Arab 
lands, as run under the Israeli rule, Mr. 'Amr said that only 13 
administrators were appointed to supervise the work of 22,000 
teachers and 608,333 students in 1,500 schools. 
  This situation, coupled with Israel's repeated closure of 
schools over the past 27 years, clearly manifests Israel's 
disregard of the Palestinian people's right to education, said 
Mr. 'Amr. 
  "We want to retain the strongest possible ties with Jordan, 
and education is one of the fields in which we can achieve this 
end," added Mr. 'Amr. 
  Mr. 'Amr said his department has recently concluded 
agreements with UNESCO, under which the latter would finance and 
help carry out educational programmes in Palestinian lands, 
including educational radio broadcasts. 
  UNESCO has also agreed to set up a Palestinian centre for 
developing educational curricula, to be financed by the Italian 
government, added Mr. 'Amr. 
  The department has been in contact with the commissioner 
general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), 
the Arab League Educational Sientific and Cultural Organisation, 
as well as the Islamic Educational Scientific and cultural 
organisation (ISESCO) to help implement Palestinian educational 
plans, added, Mr. 'Amr. 
  Mr. 'Amr said the curricula of academic and vocational 
training in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is bound to be at the 
basis of the future of the Palestinian society.

  [Text] Jerusalem -- Orient House [PLO headquarters in 
Jerusalem] issued a statement on the Shamgar Commission report 
and the omitted facts. The statement says: The Israeli Shamgar 
Commission's report places a large question mark on the real aim 
for which this commission was set up and whether the commission 
was indeed serious in finding out the real causes behind the 
Hebron massacre or if it was just an attempt to exonerate the 
Israeli occupation authorities from their responsibility. 
  Through an elaborate examination of the report it becomes 
clear, with utmost regret, that it is tantamount to an elegantly 
polished facade that conceals a horrible feature. The report, 
in its results, aims, and recommendations has sought to affirm 
and reinforce the objective circumstances that led to the 
massacre for which it held a single person responsible, without 
paying attention to the causes and factors that produced this 
killer and which every day are producing scores of his ilk, who 
are seething with resentment against defenseless Palestinians. 
  It is worth noting that such a repugnant and bloody massacre 
took place in a sacred site, resulting in scores of victims, 
without a single Israeli military or political official being 
called to justice, especially as numerous pieces of evidence and 
statements had pointed an accusing finger at more than an 
Israeli party whether directly or indirectly involved in this 
massacre. 
  The report's recommendations are procedural, based on 
reinforcing the status quo with all its gravity. They do not 
rise to the level of analyzing the results and drawing 
conclusions from this massacre and the real reasons that led to 
it; namely, the settlers' presence in the heart of Hebron and 
the elements of provocation and instability which this presence 
represents, especially as thousands of settlers serve in the 
Israeli Army and implement their objectives within sight and 
earshot of their commanders. In addition, their work in various 
official Israeli agencies allows them to obtain the required 
information and the necessary weapons for perpetrating these 
massacres against the Palestinian people's sons. 
  The report's results, apart from clearing Israel -- as an 
occupying authority -- of responsibility for the al-Ibrahimi 
Mosque massacre, bestowed legitimacy on the occupation's 
measures inside the mosque and on the facts established forcibly 
by Israel there. These results were established based on 
measures that are basically null and void and which contravene 
international law and the Geneva Conventions. 
  Out of concern for the rights, safety, and security of our 
people, we stress that the report ignored the roots of the 
problem, which is the Jewish settlement presence in the heart of 
Hebron, and disregarded the daily attacks by armed settlers 
against the citizens of the town. This constitutes a time bomb 
of dire consequences for which the occupation authorities bear 
full responsibility. 
  While expressing our regret over the results and 
recommendations contained in the Shamgar Commission report and 
its disregard of all these facts, we call on the United Nations 
and its international institutions to refute this report and 
what it entails and to consider it merely as an attempt to 
contain the situation, exonerate the occupation from the Hebron 
massacre before public opinion, and cover up its crimes against 
the defenseless Palestinian people.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Ambassador Muhammad Subayh, 
Palestine's permanent envoy to the Arab League, stated that the 
Israeli authorities banned him from entering the Palestinian 
self-rule areas because he is the Palestine National Council 
[PNC] secretary general. 
  In statements he made today, he said that the PLO asked that 
110 PNC members be allowed to enter the self-rule areas but 
Israel agreed to allow only 83 members and refused to let the 
others enter these areas. 
  Commenting on the report issued by the Israeli commission 
that investigated the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, which laid 
the blame fully on the Jewish settler, Subayh said: There is 
nothing odd in having such a report that explains the massacre, 
which claimed the lives of more than 70 worshipers last Ramadan, 
as an individual act. He added that the Palestinian people is 
used to such reports and positions on massacres perpetrated by 
Israeli soldiers. 
  Muhammad Subayh went on to say: Israeli soldiers and police 
should have been tried and the committee investigating the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque should have recommended the expulsion of 
settlers from the Palestinian urban area and the disarmament of 
Jewish settlers. 
  The Palestinian envoy stressed that security during the 
transitional period in the Palestinian self-rule areas following 
the agreements reached in Oslo and Cairo has become the 
responsibility of the Palestinian police. He noted that the 
Israeli Government is hesitant and not taking a firm stand 
against the extremist elements in the Israeli army.

not surprising that the Palestinians received the report, 
released yesterday, by the Shamgar Commission set up by Israel 
to investigate the circumstances of the bloody and horrifying 
massacre at the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque with condemnation and 
denunciation." The paper adds: "This commission ignored the 
fact that the horrible massacre came as a result of the policy 
of encouragement and tolerance pursued by the occupation 
authorities in dealing with the settlers, their crimes, and 
their attacks against defenseless Palestinians about which the 
Palestinian side had always warned. It also ignored the issue 
of the settlement and arming the settlers as a main cause for 
the massacre." The paper deems the commission's recommendation 
to restrict the introduction of weapons into the mosque as 
inadequate. It asks: "When there is more than one Goldstein 
among armed settlers, what guarantee is there that another armed 
settler will not commit another massacre in another place?" The 
editorial decries the fact that no Israeli official has been 
called to justice despite such a horrible massacre. It 
concludes: "At any rate, the above-mentioned commission report 
affirms the Palestinian conviction that, from the outset, the 
formation of this commission was aimed at exonerating Israel 
from its responsibility and absorbing the effects of the 
massacre, especially in the international arena. From this 
premise, the commission report was not surprising to us, nor did 
it add anything new to what we had been accustomed to in this 
regard." 
  In an editorial on pages 3 and 7 entitled "The Shamgar 
Report 
and the Omitted Facts," Jerusalem AL-NAHAR in Arabic says that 
"the commission's report should have explained that in Hebron 
and Qiryat Arba' there is fertile ground for extremists and that 
more Goldsteins are waiting for an opportunity to commit similar 
massacres against the defenseless and innocent Palestinian 
people, as Rabin himself admitted yesterday. We hoped that the 
report would recommend the need to put an end to those 
bloodthirsty extremists." After noting that the report called on 
the Israeli Government to separate Muslims and Jews in the 
al-Ibrahimi Mosque, the paper asks: "Why did the commission not 
have the courage to sanction the separation of Muslims and Jews 
in the city by removing the Jews from there? 
  "With all due respect to the commission members, the report 
was bland in color and content, as if the objective was not to 
point an accusing finger or offend the emotions of any party." 
In conclusion, the paper says the Palestinians had hoped that 
the commission report would be a verdict on the settler 
terrorism, "but it was disappointing and created bitterness and 
scorn among our people." 
  Jerusalem AL-MANAR in Arabic on page 1 carries an editorial 
entitled "The Shamgar Report and Disregard of the Facts." This 
paper, too, says that the Shamgar Commission report was 
"disappointing" and "ignored many of the facts which this 
commission should have taken into account." The editorial notes 
that "the Israeli Government and all the political and security 
leaders welcomed this report because it did not hold any of them 
responsible. It placed the responsibility for this hideous 
crime on Barukh Goldstein alone." The paper accuses the Israeli 
Government of ignoring the Palestinians' complaints against the 
settlers and says that "settlements are time bombs that might 
explode at any moment, and the Shamgar Commission failed to 
mention these settlements in its report which filled more than 
300 pages." After asserting that Goldstein alone did not commit 
the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the editorial says: "While 
rejecting this report which has been welcomed by all the Israeli 
leadership, we emphasize that the causes which led Goldstein and 
his partners to commit their crime are still there."

  [Text] A general commercial strike was announced in 
Jericho today, and most of the city's stores remained closed. 
The strike was called to protest the continued incarceration of 
Palestinians in Israeli prisons. The Jericho strike is the 
first since the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] handed over the area 
to the Palestinian police. 
  Also today, Jericho was re-opened to tourists.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F>
Razi Barqay; place not given -- live] 
  [Text] [Barqay] Before we touch upon the political issues, 
I would like to refer you to the German television documentary 
aired yesterday and ask you whether we know for certain that the 
Syrians are involved in Ron Arad's captivity or at least know 
about it. 
  [Peres] We issued official statements on the issue, and 
there 
is no need for me to repeat them. 
  [Barqay] If so, let us talk about political matters. When 
and where will the negotiations with Jordan start? 
  [Peres] They are scheduled to start in mid-July on the 
border. 
  [Barqay] On the Israeli-Jordanian border? 
  [Peres] Yes. 
  [Barqay] Will you install special trailers on the site? 
  [Peres] I do not know. These are technical negotiations, and 
it makes no difference whether they are held in trailers, 
houses, or tents. 
  [Barqay] At what level will the negotiations be held? 
  [Peres] I assume they will initially be held on the level of 
professionals. 
  [Barqay] By officials? 
  [Peres] Yes. 
  [Barqay] When will you at long last be able to meet face to 
face and openly with King Husayn? 
  [Peres] First of all, I met face to face and openly with the 
Jordanian crown prince. 
  [Barqay] It is not the same. 
  [Peres] Is it not? All right. [laughs] We will yet get to 
that high level. 
  [Barqay] Has the king promised to meet you and Yitzhaq Rabin 
in the foreseeable future? 
  [Peres] The king made a general announcement you all heard. 
He said the time will come when overt meetings are held, but he 
did not cite a date. 
  [Barqay] Sir, what is the main problem between us and 
Jordan? 
  [Peres] The main problem is Jordan. We have no problems with 
Jordan. In my opinion, the disputed issues can be settled in a 
reasonable manner and within a short period of time. If there 
were delays, these were initiated by Jordan and not by us. 
  [Barqay] I would like to remind you of what you said a few 
months ago, that the only thing missing was a pen. 
  [Peres] That is correct. Meanwhile, what I was referring to 
has been signed. You know, people have very short memories. We 
talked then about a declaration of principles between us and 
Jordan, and such a declaration has indeed been signed. 
  [Barqay] To quote the prime minister's remarks before the 
Knesset committee today, actually nothing is happening on the 
Syrian issue. Is that true? 
  [Peres] There has actually been no breakthrough so far. Our 
actions are based on the fundamental assumption that the Syrians 
are prepared to make peace, but this assumption has not yet been 
corroborated by any steps. 
  [Barqay] If you have received an official notice, could you 
tell us when Christopher will arrive here? 
  [Peres] Apparently in mid-July. We are very glad he is 
coming. We think he plays an important role and is a credible 
man. His arrival at this time within these parameters is very 
important. 
  [Barqay] Does his main mission lie on the Jerusalem-Damascus 
axis? 
  [Peres] Yes, but this will not be his only mission. I assume 
he will also deal with the Jordanian, Palestinian, and 
multilateral issues pertaining to the peace process from the 
U.S. point of view. 
  [Barqay] Where do the speculations about Yasir 'Arafat's 
visit to Jerusalem stand? 
  [Peres] As far as I know, Yasir 'Arafat has at this point 
not 
asked to visit Jerusalem. You know, we have a talent to 
complicate our lives and I see no reason for it. He has not 
approached us with a request to visit Jerusalem, and I see no 
reason to give answers before questions are posed. 
  [Barqay] Nevertheless, when he asks, what will be your 
reply? 
  [Peres] I will give the necessary answer then. 
  [Barqay] Do you have a problem with such a visit? 
  [Peres] There is definitely a problem, but it is not a 
matter 
of principle. In principle, he may come to Jerusalem. However, 
there are many problems involved, such as the timing and 
security. This will not be a simple visit. 
  [Barqay] Shim'on Peres, thank you very much.

  [Text] Israel has offered Jordan open meetings that will be 
held in Israel and Jordan alternatively, Prime Minister Yitzhaq 
Rabin told the members of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee today. He believes that the negotiations will 
begin in July. Speaking on the Syrian issue, the prime minister 
said that the secretary of state will arrive in the region in 
mid-July on a shuttle mission between Damascus and Jerusalem. 
The gaps with the Syrians have not been narrowed and, until the 
Syrians launch a serious dialogue with us, there will be no 
progress. Our correspondent at the Knesset Tamar Asalem reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Asalem] At present, there are serious 
doubts regarding Jordan's willingness to sign a separate peace 
agreement with us, Rabin said. At the same time, we have 
reached an understanding that the tripartite framework -- the 
United States, Jordan, and Israel -- should be employed on 
economic issues. The talks aim at creating a reality of 
dialogue in the region, even if a peace agreement is not signed 
and only economic and civilian agreements are attained. Rabin 
also disclosed that Israel had offered Jordan the holding of 
open meetings in Israel and Jordan alternatively. In the first 
stage, Jordan wants to find a spot in the 'Arava, near the 
disputed areas, and also demands that talks be held in air 
conditioned mobile homes. The prime minister believes that 
these negotiations will begin in July. 
  Regarding the Syrian issue, the prime minister said that 
U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher will shuttle between 
Damascus and Jerusalem in mid-July. The United States will not 
make offers, and we are not interested in them doing so. The 
Americans may relay stands but, until the Syrians begin a more 
serious dialogue, there will be no progress. 
  Knesset Member Binyamin Netanyahu said that he believes the 
Syrians are growing weak in several spheres, including the 
military. Rabin responded to that by saying: Where did you hear 
this joke? Netanyahu showed the committee a document drafted by 
the Foreign Ministry's Political Planning Department regarding 
the negotiations with Syria. 
  [Netanyahu] The document, drafted by the Foreign Ministry's 
professional echelons, says: The negotiations with Syria should 
be conducted with a cool mind, no haste, and patience. The 
prime minister is doing the opposite: He is impatient, rushes 
forward, and is nervous. In fact, he seems to be panicking with 
real or imaginary fear of the next war. 
  [Asalem] The prime minister said that it seems to him that 
the party most concerned with his declaration regarding a 
possible war with Syria -- is Syria. According to him, he does 
not remember such a vast amount of weapons, some of which are 
the most advanced, arriving in Syria since the end of 1993. 
Coming out of the committee room, Rabin added that this is part 
of the overall Middle East arms race. 
  [Rabin] All the Middle East countries are increasing their 
military power. Egypt, which lives in peace with us, is 
increasing and upgrading its military ability. So are Saudi 
Arabia, Israel, and Syria. The current reality is that there is 
an arms race in the Middle East. [end recording] 
  The prime minister also told the committee members that 
Israel has already established an authority for handling and 
rehabilitating Palestinians collaborators. He added that large 
amounts of money have been allocated for the authority, and 
former Major General Shlomo Gazit has been appointed to head it.

  [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says that where 
negotiations with Syria are concerned, Israel is demanding that 
no Israeli settlements be removed in the first stage of 
withdrawal on the Golan Heights. 
  Briefing the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee 
today, Rabin at the same time warned that if there is no peace 
agreement between Israel and Syria in the next two or three 
years, he will recommend injecting large sums of money into the 
Army to prepare for the possibility of war. From the Knesset, 
David Ze'ev reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Ze'ev] On his way out of the Foreign 
Affairs and Defense Committee, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin 
downplayed the Syrian arms buildup. [passage omitted] 
  But, according to a Knesset official inside the closed-door 
meeting, the premier sounded a totally different note there. 
Said Rabin: Since the end of last year, I cannot remember such 
a large quantity of arms reaching Syria, and of the most 
advanced type: hundreds of T-72 tanks; not an insignificant 
number of mobile artillery; and Rabin referred to Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin saying that Moscow will continue to 
supply spare military parts to Damascus -- due to the Russian 
commitment -- and that if the Syrians kept up to their payment 
schedule of paying off an $11 billion debt, the Russians would 
supply surface-to-surface SA-10 missiles as well. 
  Rabin also sounded a more ominous note than in last week's 
statement on a possible war with Syria in the coming years, if 
there is no peace agreement. Rabin told the Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee -- following criticism from the opposition on 
the committee -- that if there is no agreement in two to three 
years, I would recommend injecting huge amounts of money into 
the Israel Defense Forces to allow the IDF to prepare for the 
possibility of war. 
  The prime minister also justified the delay of the donor 
countries in sending money to the PLO to fund self-rule 
operations until they know how the moneies will be supervised 
and to where they will be going. But he hoped for progress when 
he meets PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat in Paris next week. 
[passage omitted] 
  Rabin said he had not invited 'Arafat to visit the Jerusalem 
holy shrines in his newspaper interviews last weekend, only that 
he was repeating the policy of previous Israeli Governments of 
freedom of access to all Muslims and Christians. [end recording] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 28 June 
adds: "Yitzhaq Rabin said today that the government is looking 
into ways to expand the Jewish population in Jerusalem, but 
there are difficulties in locating land. The government, he 
said, is willing to confiscate land to this end, but it is 
awaiting a ruling by the High Court of Justice on several 
petitions regarding matters of land in Jerusalem. Our 
correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the prime minister was 
speaking at the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee."]

  [Text] Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert says he accepts that 
Yasir 'Arafat in principle has the right to visit Jerusalem, but 
he objects to such a visit because of 'Arafat's role and for 
fear that it might cause unnecessary friction between Jews and 
Arabs. The mayor of Jerusalem believes that 'Arafat would not 
be coming to pray, but to make declarations. Our correspondent 
Aviv Bushinsky reports that Olmert made these remarks in a 
special meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Mr. Rabin 
summoned the meeting following complaints about a lack of 
communication between him and the mayor. The two men agreed to 
go on meeting in the future to promote various issues, including 
the development of the city. 
  In a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee earlier today, Rabin said that the government was 
looking for every possible way to expand the Jewish population 
of Jerusalem. However, Rabin noted, it is difficult to locate 
land and the government is awaiting the High Court of Justice 
ruling on the issue. 
  Meanwhile, Jerusalem Municipality sources told our 
correspondent that they have been holding legal deliberations 
with regard to illegally built houses in East Jerusalem and 
their possible demolition. The sources noted that two such 
houses in East Jerusalem, over which legal proceedings were 
completed, were demolished in the last two days.

<F P=106> [Report by Nadav Shragay] </F>
  [Text] The Jerusalem Municipality wants to create an line 
of Jewish contiguity between Wadi al-Jawz and Mount Scopus in 
the eastern part of town. Instructions in that spirit were 
transmitted to the town's Planning Department for plans to be 
prepared to be presented to the local planning and construction 
committee. 
  The town hall wants to advance these plans with the 
Construction and Housing Ministry, and the two have held 
discussions on the matter, but have not reached any practical 
conclusions. 
  In several months, the Border Police will evacuate its 
headquarters from the Shpaer Hotel located near this area. The 
hotel is currently being leased to the Border Police by Jewish 
financier Erwin Moscowitz, patron of 'Ateret Hakohanim Yeshiva. 
Moscowitz will probably operate a hotel at the site, which will 
become part of the Jewish area the municipality is planning. 
  Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Shmu'el Me'ir yesterday called on 
Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer to hold 
up the plan to build 72 housing units for Arabs. The ministry 
is about to present a plan to Jerusalem's Regional Council for 
Planning and Construction. Under the plan, a neighborhood and 
several public buildings will be build on the southern slopes of 
Mount Scopus. 
  Me'ir claims that the neighborhood is being planned on an 
important traffic axis -- the road cutting across Mount Scopus 
-- and its establishment could harm security. He also said that 
the site meant for an Arab neighborhood is located on the 
southern slopes of Mount Scopus and that the area is supposed to 
constitute a green belt encircling the hill. The deputy mayor 
also claims that a cemetery dating from biblical times is 
situated there. 
  The Jerusalem Municipality made it clear yesterday that 
despite Waqf protests, preparatory work will continue on the 
Avshalom sentinel on the Ophel path near Lions' Gate. The East 
Jerusalem Development Company, in cooperation with the 
municipality and the Tourism Ministry, is setting up lookouts at 
several sites in the area. A fence is being built and the road 
is being expanded as part of the work. The Waqf heads claim 
that the area belongs to them while the municipality says that 
the plan has the approval of local and regional committees and 
that the area was legally appropriated. 
  Egypt's Ambassador Muhammad Basyuni yesterday cabled the 
Foreign Ministry on the issue, and the Waqf heads called on 
international bodies for assistance in preventing Israel from 
setting up a tourism project within the walls of the Old City. 
  Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said "it is inconceivable that 
Waqf officials should try to dictate to the Jerusalem 
Municipality not to pave a road in an area which has Jewish and 
historical value and which will serve the population and 
tourists. 
  [Tel Aviv DAVAR in Hebrew on 24 June in a page-2 article 
quotes Ofir Pines, Labors' coordinator of activities, in a 
letter to the state controller as saying that "there is 
increasing involvement by Jerusalem Municipality in activities 
opposed to the peace process." Pines notes that "the 
municipality assisted in the establishment of the settlers' 
protest outside the Prime Minister's Office, provided it with 
water and electricity, and are involved in organizing right-wing 
demonstrations."]

  [Text] Nabil Sha'th will come to Jerusalem on 1 July and 
will watch a joint Palestinian-Israeli theater production. 
According to Minister Shulamit Aloni, the prime minister 
approved the visit. 
  At the same time, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said this 
morning that this is not about a theater performance; rather, 
the Sha'th visit is a political demonstration by the PLO, and he 
will have no part of it. Minister Aloni said that at this 
stage, Jerusalem is a religious issue and that there is nothing 
more wonderful than having the capital of the Jewish people open 
to all. 
  Olmert said he is pleased that in his meeting with the prime 
minister yesterday they did not deal with philosophy, because 
the issues at hand are political. The Jerusalem mayor said he 
is pleased with what he heard from the prime minister, but added 
that he gives Mr. Rabin and the government six months to prove 
their intentions in deeds, such as allocating resources for the 
city, expanding construction there, building roads, and 
developing the education system in both parts of the city. 
  Aloni and Olmert spoke to Qol Yisra'el this morning.

<F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Aluf Ben] </F>
  [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has proposed 
incorporating Israel into NATO's Partnership for Peace in 
Europe. The proposal, included in a report Peres presented to 
the Knesset on his ministry's activities, says that the 
expansion of Israel's diplomatic ties includes joining 
organizations in which it has not held membership to date. 
  Peres raised the proposal in a conversation with U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington about a 
month ago, when he proposed that Israel, Jordan, and Egypt join 
the Partnership for Peace and form a dialogue with NATO on joint 
security problems as a start toward future regional security 
cooperation. [passage omitted] 
  A different Peres proposal was to include Israel in the CSCE 
and to establish a dialogue on security in the Mediterranean 
basin and on economic cooperation. The Foreign Ministry began 
contacts with the CSCE secretariat in Vienna, and according to 
the report presented to the Knesset, the Israeli initiative was 
welcomed by the organization's secretary general. 
  Foreign Ministry sources said yesterday that the proposal 
for 
inclusion in European security organizations were brought up as 
a basis for the new security regime Israel is proposing be set 
up in the Middle East. Peres had proposed that it be based on 
the existing European mechanisms initially, with a separate 
regional framework being set up later. 
  According to the sources, the Foreign Ministry top echelons 
now prefer to immediately set up a regional framework to be 
called the "Middle East CSCE," which would have three "baskets": 
security, economic cooperation, and human relations. 
  Peres proposed that the multilateral talks be used as the 
basis for setting up the organization, which would serve as a 
nucleus for a new system of relations between Middle East 
countries in the era of peace.

  [Excerpt] In Bordj Bou Arreridj Province, Abderrahmane 
Meziane Cherif, minister of interior, local authorities, 
environment, and administrative reform, attended the official 
installation of the governor today. He delivered a speech in 
which he outlined the government program in the transitional 
period. Over to Nourredine Daroui from Bordj Bou Arreridj: 
  [Daroui] In his meeting with officials and members of the 
public, the minister talked about the internal situation in the 
country in general. 
  [Begin Cherif recording] Regrettably, we notice that the 
spirit of factionalism and extremism has triumphed over wisdom 
and clear-sightedness. All Algerians have to overcome these 
beliefs that are so incompatible with the national interest and 
the spirit of fraternity and brotherliness which has enabled us, 
through the centuries, to preserve our personality with all its 
aspects. This is the spirit which led to the uprising of 
November [1954] and its intrinsic significance. [end recording] 
  [Daroui] The interior minister also talked about the 
importance and objectives of the transitional period in all 
fields within the framework of action aimed at bringing the 
country out of the stifling crisis it is going through. He said: 
  [Begin Cherif recording] The world is now watching, with 
astonishment, our acute disagreements and our confrontations and 
it is interfering in our affairs by supporting parties or 
deviant groups. Local and then legislative elections were held 
and democracy was nearly wiped out because some people regard it 
as blasphemy, while others see it as a means to remove others. 
Thus, we are now going through a transitional period which we 
hope will take us, once and for all, out of the contradictions 
and conflicts and lead us toward a bright future under 
democracy, the democracy which respects the country's ideals. 
[end recording] 
  [Daroui] Regarding the real perspectives for the future, the 
interior minister pointed out that the best alternative is 
action on the ground. [passage omitted]

  [Text] The prime minister, Ms. Benazir Bhutto, has said the 
Kashmir problem is the key for solution of all issues between 
Pakistan an India and urged New Delhi to enter into dialogue for 
its solution in accordance with internatinal law and aspirations 
of the Kashmiri people. She was presiding over a meeting of the 
Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council in Islamabad today. 
  The prime minister referred to the serious situation in 
occupied Kashmir and assured Kashmiri brethren that the people's 
government will continue its moral, political, and diplomatic 
support for their just cause. She said under the UN Resolution, 
India is a party to the Kashmir dispute and it is that country's 
moral and international obligation to implement UN Resolution 
and end tension in the region so that the two countries could 
utilize their resources for the welfare of their people. She 
said it is in the interest of India to give the right of 
self-determination to Kashmiri people. She said India has 
increased its budget for defense by 20 percent and this shows 
its failure in Jammu and Kashmir despite massing six lakh army 
and paramilitary forces. 
  The prime minister referred to the testing of Prithvi 
missile 
by India and the reported deployment of these missiles along the 
Pakistani border. She said Pakistan has always adopted the path 
of self-restraint, while India went for missile, nuclear, and 
arms race. She said Pakistanis are a peace-loving nation and 
would not take steps which could lead to arms race. She 
condemned the Prithvi missile test by India and said by doing so 
India was trying to change the status quo in the region. She 
said if there is to be peace in the subcontinent it is essential 
that Indian Government should reveal its missile program. 
  Ms. Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan fought three wars with 
India 
because of its support for Kashmiris and conspiracies were 
hatched because of this support to divide Pakistan. She said 
those talking of (?adoption) of independent Kashmir do not know 
that Kashmiris and Pakistanis are one. She said this issue is 
alive because of the sacrifices of Kashmiris and Pakistan's 
support under [words indistinct] principle. She spoke of the 
massive killings of Kashmiris by Indian forces and torture in 
jails and urged the international community to take a serious 
notice of these human rights violations.

  [Text] Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, member of the 
Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, and his 
delegation today left for Amman on a visit of several days to 
Jordan at the invitation of Jordanian political forces and 
organizations. 
  Comrade 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur told an Iraqi News 
Agency correspondent that the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party 
delegation will hold meetings with political parties and forces 
in fraternal Jordan to activate the joint pan-Arab action in an 
effort to employ all means to lift the unjust blockade imposed 
on Iraq, which fulfilled all of its obligations toward the UN 
Security Council resolutions despite the injustice and 
unfairness it had to endure. 
  He said the serious departure from the biased U.S. stand by 
some UN Security Council permanent members and other members 
during the previous two reviews in March and May puts on the 
political parties and forces, the Arab nation's masses, and the 
virtuous people of the world a responsibility to continue the 
work to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq through party 
and parliamentary activities before the next UN Security Council 
review in July. 
  The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation includes comrades 
'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, head of the Foreign Relations Bureau, 
and Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, member of the Foreign Relations Bureau.

  [Text] Baghdad, 28 Jun (INA) -- Vice President Taha Yasin 
Ramadan has asserted that the Iraqi people, who are being 
subjected to an unfair blockade imposed by the evil coalition 
forces led by the United States, have managed, through their 
heroic steadfastness under the leadership of President Saddam 
Husayn, to break the blockade, preserve their strength, and take 
the reins of progress and development by virtue of their will. 
  During his reception of Muhammad Gulcegun, deputy chairman 
of 
the Turkish Social Democratic Populist Party and member of the 
Turkish Grand National Assembly [title as received], and his 
delegation, Ramadan added that the governments implementing the 
U.S. policy are imposing a blockade on their own peoples and 
subjecting them to suffering due to the deterioration in their 
economic situation as a result of the continued blockade on Iraq. 
  The vice president touched on Iraqi-Turkish relations and 
their development under hard circumstances throughout history. 
He asserted that promoting the relations between the two 
countries will contribute to improving the economic situation of 
both neighboring peoples and consolidate regional stability and 
security. 
  The Turkish party official pointed to the Turkish people's 
suffering due to the continued blockade on Iraq, as well as the 
activities carried out by the Turkish parties and organizations 
which demand the lifting of the blockade imposed on Iraq. He 
also lauded the Iraqis' steadfastness and their defiance of the 
blockade. This proves the Iraqis' strength, adherence to their 
principles, and struggle for sovereignty and progress, he added.

blatantly violates international and humanitarian laws and norms. 
  Sa'di Mahdi Salih underscored the importance of developing 
Iraqi-Turkish relations. He said: We should provide the 
conditions that enhance cooperation between our two friendly 
countries in all fields in the interest of our two peoples. 
  Gulcegun expressed the Turkish party's solidarity with the 
Iraqi people in their fight against the blockade.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "One Day the Hammer Will Fall on Certain Heads"] </F>
  [Text] The late former Turkish President Turgut Ozal had 
played the card of U.S. aggression against Iraq on the basis of 
lose one, win three. However, Turkey lost all four. In fact, 
it lost, and is still losing, a great deal. 
  Turkey lost its trade with Iraq through which it used to 
make 
$20 billion annually. It also lost 400,000 job opportunities 
which were available to workers in restaurants and gas filling 
stations as well as to the kids on the road to Zakho and the 
drivers and owners of 17,000 Turkish trucks which used to 
transport goods to Iraq. If we also count the family members of 
these workers, drivers, and truck owners we get a clear picture 
of the great damage that has hit that region. 
  But what is more important than all that and which cannot be 
compensated or evaluated in dollars, whether U.S. or Gulf 
dollars, is the serious threat which the Americans pose to 
Turkey's national security and territorial integrity which, as 
we know, has always been the main obsession of all governments 
in Turkey. 
  The Americans and the British have created a so-called 
"security zone" for Kurds in northern Iraq guarded by an 
Anglo-American force which they termed the "Hammer Force" to use 
as a tool which, they believe, would help them shake up the 
leadership of Saddam Husayn. 
  They and their agents in Saudi Arabia wagered that the 
situation in Iraq would not last for more than six months. But 
their wager failed miserably. 
  When the first six months passed, they extended the presence 
of this "hammer" another six months in the hope that their 
wishes and wagers would materialize. But they also failed. The 
renewal was repeated every six months and the Americans and 
British were disappointed six times. 
  Yesterday, the Turkish Parliament renewed the presence of 
this "hammer" for the seventh abortive time. The result of the 
voting in the Turkish Parliament on the seventh renewal was as 
follows: 
  - The deputies who voted for the renewal were 193. 
  - The deputies who voted against the renewal were 147. 
  - And, the deputies who were absent were 110. 
  Although the renewal decision obtained the "legal" majority, 
the large number of deputies who voted against the renewal and 
those who were absent -- it was said that most of them had 
stayed away deliberately -- indicates that the decision did not 
gain the "political" majority. 
  This means that the opposition to U.S. presence, which has 
become a real threat to Turkey's national security and 
territorial integrity, U.S. tampering with the question of the 
pipeline which carries Iraqi oil across Turkey, the pressure 
being brought to bear on Turkey concerning the Cyprus issue, the 
campaigns which are being waged in Europe and the United States 
against the violation of human rights in Turkey, and the lack of 
a U.S. desire to open the Zakho gateway before Turkish trucks; 
all these facts have for some time now aroused strong reactions 
among Turkish nationalist parties and figures which have reached 
the point of disgust at the continuous U.S. domination and 
pressure to influence Turkish national policy in order to 
satisfy the egos of worthless politicians in Washington. 
  But what is regrettable is that in his defense before the 
Turkish Parliament of the decision to renew the presence of the 
Hammer Force, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said: "Were 
it not for this force, the Turkish Army would not have been able 
to cross into northern Iraq from time to time to strike at 
elements of the Turkish Kurdish Workers Party-PKK. 
  He also said: "It is the prerogative of the Turkish 
Government to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it 
wants. That time will come when Baghdad abides by all the UN 
resolutions and enters into a direct dialogue with the Kurds, 
Turkmen, and other nationalities." 
  Cetin noted: "This subject will be discussed during a 
meeting of the foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran, and Syria in 
Damascus next month." 
  Here, we would like to remind the Turkish foreign minister 
of 
the following facts: 
  1. Coordination between the subversive organizations in 
northern Iraq and the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] in Turkey has 
actually increased with the presence of the "Hammer Force." 
Turkey has carried out several large scale air raids on PKK 
military bases in northern Iraq without avail. 
  2. The coordination which existed before the U.S. aggression 
between Iraq and Turkey on issues concerning border security was 
most effective and security conditions in both Turkey and Iraq 
were stable, calm, and satisfactory to both sides. 
  3. The so-called "security zone" has not been secure for a 
long time. In fact, we are not exaggerating when we say that 
this zone has witnessed, and continues to witness, under the 
ignorant U.S. hegemony the worst state of insecurity and 
instability similar to the one existing in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, especially after Iran has also come in to secure a 
foothold for itself in the region -- something which it would 
not have dared to do in the past -- through the formation and 
training of Islamic movements operating under the direction of 
the Tehran ayatollahs. 
  4. Turkish-Iranian cooperation on this issue in particular 
is more beneficial to Iran than it is to Turkey under the 
existing insecure conditions in northern Iraq. By cooperating 
with Iran, avoiding cooperation with Iraq, and approving U.S. 
policy in the region, the Turkish side places all its cards 
before the Iranian side. Turkey will not gain anything from 
this cooperation other than more headaches. it is understood 
that for some time now Iran has been preparing and backing 
subversive movements which claim to be Islamic inside and 
outside Turkey and that the current situation in northern Iraq 
is so precarious that Iranian presence in it has become clear, 
thanks to the "security zone" policy which is supported by 
Turkey. 
  If the Turkish side is unaware of these facts or ignores 
them, this is a tragedy. 
  While it is correct from the legal viewpoint, as the Turkish 
foreign minister has said, that the Turkish Government has the 
prerogative to ask these forces to leave Turkey whenever it 
wants, the question is: Can Turkey do that politically? 
  Moreover, what is the relationship between the Hammer Force 
and Iraq's implementation of the Security Council resolutions? 
Why does the Turkish foreign minister purposely mix the cards 
when he knows full well that the Hammer Force was a unilateral 
hostile action by the Americans and that there is no Security 
Council resolution authorizing them to take this action? 
  Cetin also knows full well that Iraq has implemented its 
obligations under the Security Council resolutions and that 
several states, including three major powers, are demanding a 
partial or total lift of the blockade on Iraq since it has 
fulfilled its obligations. 
  Cetin also says that the time to ask these forces to leave 
will come when Baghdad enters into a direct dialogue with the 
Kurds, Turkmen, and other nationalities. 
  Although such talk constitutes an interference in Iraq's 
internal affairs and is therefore rejected, Cetin knows full 
well also that the Iraqi Government had entered into a deep and 
wide dialogue with the Kurds and reached an agreement with the 
Kurdish parties in September 1991. We were about to sign and 
announce this agreement were it not for the interference of the 
U.S. Administration which prevented the Kurds from signing it 
and kept them prisoners in the "U.S. protectorate." 
  Cetin should remember also that one of the problems of the 
Kurdish region is the refusal and inability of the Turkish side 
to hold a dialogue with 15 million Kurds in its own country all 
these past years. 
  Unfortunately, it seems that the Turkish side has been 
infected by U.S. double-standards. The day will come when the 
hammer will fall on the heads of the worthless politicians in 
Washington and London.

  [Text] Tripoli, 28 Jun -- (JANA) -- The brother leader of 
the revolution [al-Qadhdhafi] has underlined that the proposal 
to put on trial the alleged defendants in the so-called 
Lockerbie case at the International Court of Justice is not a 
Libyan proposal. Rather, it was a suggestion put forward by 
international legal quarters. He explained that the proposal 
was endorsed by the Arab League and the OAU. 
  During a press conference held yesterday at the end of 
Egyptian President Husni Mubarak's visit to the Great 
Jamahiriyah, the brother leader said that this proposal 
represents the only solution to this issue. He pointed out that 
this proposal is convincing and would satisfy all the concerned 
parties [words indistinct]. 
  The leader added that following its adoption by the Arab 
League and the OAU, this proposal is expected to be submitted to 
the UN Security Council [UNSC] in the form of a draft resolution 
for endorsement. The leader indicated that if the world is 
searching for a solution, the way is now open and clear 
following the surfacing of irrefutable evidence which confirms 
that there were other parties which admitted carrying out this 
act. He pointed to the recent confession of the Palestinian 
Sha'ban before a Lebanese court. These confessions sent shock 
waves through the UNSC and international public opinion 
regarding the justifications for maintaining sanctions against 
one country with no reason. 
  The brother leader stressed that the confessions of the 
Palestinian citizen Sha'ban before the Lebanese court put the 
UNSC in a dilemma, when he admitted carrying out this act. 
Sha'ban said: "This is a sacred conflict between us and Zionism 
and imperialism. I carried out this act for the sake of my cause 
and the Arab cause." This frank admission caused the UNSC to 
have strong doubts that Libya was not the only accused side, but 
there were other parties that have now become accused of his 
act. 
  In the press conference he held yesterday, the brother 
leader 
pointed out that the team of lawyers for the two Libyan 
suspects, which is composed of Libyan and foreign lawyers 
including Americans, and the Union of Arab Lawyers, are 
following up the confessions of the Palestinian citizen Yusuf 
Sha'ban. 
  The brother leader pointed out also that Libya was accused 
in 
the past of blowing up the Berlin club, which was used as a 
pretext to carry out an aggression against it in April 1986. 
Then it was confirmed afterward that Libya was innocent of those 
accusations. The innocence of the person accused of carrying out 
the explosion at the club on behalf of Libya was declared by the 
issuance of a legal verdict stipulating his innocence. 
  The brother leader of the revolution stressed in the press 
conference that if it were not for the interests of European 
states in Libya, with companies, investments and Libyan projects 
on Western companies are based, the stance would have been 
stronger, particularly during the days of Bush and Reagan. 
  Libya is [word indistinct] strategic projects and European 
[word indistinct] are needed to implement them. If there were 
no European companies, other companies from China, India, 
Malaysia, or North Korea would carry out those projects. 
  The brother leader said that it is in the interest of 
Western 
states to adopt the proposal of the Arab League to try the two 
suspects at the headquarters of the International Court of 
Justice, particularly since they cast doubts on whether Libya 
would hand over [the two suspects] to a neutral court or a 
neutral venue. To confirm to them that their doubts are 
unfounded, we have held consultations with Egypt about the 
transfer of the two suspects to Egypt, so that they become at 
its disposal, and when the trial is held, Egypt will guarantee 
their arrival at the venue scheduled for their trial, which is 
other than America and Britain, and Egypt has agreed to this. 
  [Words indistinct] stressed the impossibility of handing 
over 
the two suspects to the United States or Britain because the two 
suspects refused to go to these two states voluntarily and said 
that those two states are staging a campaign against us and are 
hostile to us. Just as they cast doubts on Libyan justice, we 
cast doubts on British and American justice when it on their 
land. 
  The brother leader pointed out that the proposal regarding 
the venue of the trial of the two suspects will be decided at 
the UNSC through regional organizations which are the Arab 
League, the OAU, and the Nonaligned Movement which can submit a 
project to be adopted by the UNSC. 
  In reply to a question about the possibility of tightening 
the unjust measures against the Great Jamahiriyah, the brother 
leader underlined that these measures were unjustified since 
sanctions were imposed against Libya as if it were accused. 
Libya suffered from these sanctions before it was even accused; 
he indicated that this is a very important point. 
  He stated that Libya has lost a great deal because it was 
accused. If Libya was accused from the beginning it would not 
have paid a greater price than the one it is paying now as 
result of this embargo. He stressed that there is no longer any 
justification for any further escalation in this issue. He 
stressed that if they decide to boycott Libyan oil, they will be 
the losers at the end of the day; and that the oil embargo was 
an unhuman and decadent method. During the press conference 
held yesterday, the brother leader said that if the West 
boycotts Libyan oil, this act would represent the most barbaric 
and decadent act. Even if they threaten to use this method, 
this would make the West decadent and inhuman; this would in 
effect be an act aimed at starving people as they did in Iraq. 
  The brother leader said it is acceptable to boycott Libya 
diplomatically and impose an armed and transport embargo etc. 
As for starving the Libyan people, this is a barbaric and 
decadent act. This proves that the West is uncivilized because 
it has realized that the Libyan oil is the only source for this 
people. This is a threat against humanity because it is a 
threat to annihilate a people. 
  The brother leader indicated that the Libyan people took to 
the streets to declare its acceptance of the challenge, and 
announce its readiness to die because of starvation rather than 
submit and give in to anybody. 
  The brother leader stated that the unjust measures imposed 
against Libya have not only caused suffering for the Libyan 
people, but also for all of Libya's neighboring states; and Arab 
nationals are suffering a great deal because of this embargo. 
He expressed his regret about seeing a president of a state 
travel by plane, then being forced to walk across the borders 
onto another country. 
  During the press conference held at the conclusion of 
President Husni Mubarak's visit to the Great Jamahiriyah 
yesterday, the brother leader stressed that relations between 
the Great Jamahiriyah and Egypt are following the right path. 
Contacts will be direct and continuous between the two 
countries to boost these relations in the interest of the one 
Arab people in both countries. 
  Regarding the disappearance of Mansur al-Kikhya, the brother 
leader indicated that the appropriate apparatus in both Libya 
and Egypt are cooperating to uncover the ambiguity that 
surrounds this matter. He stated that the fingers of accusation 
have confirmed the involvement of U.S. intelligence services and 
Libyan spies who are cooperating with these services, to settle 
some scores among them. He underscored that this act carried 
out by these spies with the cooperation of U.S. intelligence 
services was not the first one of its kind, as they have in the 
past liquidated Libyan nationals who worked in the Libyan Arab 
People's Bureau in Rome. Then they tried to accuse Libya of 
having killed them. Afterward the perpetrators confessed that 
they were instructed by the stray dog spies.

  [Text] Cairo, June 28 (AFP) -- Libyan leader Mu'ammar 
al-Qadhdhafi is prepared to hand over to Egypt two men suspected 
in the Lockerbie bombing provided they are not tried in either 
the United States or Britain, Egyptian papers reported Tuesday 
[28 June]. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi told journalists late Monday that he had agreed 
with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak "to transfer the two 
suspects to Egypt" during meetings between the two leaders in 
Libya. 
  "Egypt would then be responsible for them and would 
guarantee 
to transfer them to the place fixed for their trial," 
al-Qadhdhafi said, stressing that any trial would have to be 
"elsewhere other than the United States and Great Britain." 
  The two men are accused of being behind the bombing of a 
Pan-Am Boeing which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 
December 1988, killing 270 people. 
  Al-Qadhdhafi said an Arab League proposal for Scottish 
magistrates to try the men in the International Court of Justice 
in The Hague have been well received in the West. 
  But Washington and London have both rejected the idea, 
saying 
the United Nations had called for the men to be extradited for 
trial either in the United States or in Britain. 
  "It seems a solution has been found" and that the proposal 
"will be submitted as a resolution to the UN Security Council 
for adoption," al-Qadhdhafi said. 
  He said the proposal was backed by Egypt and the 
Organisation 
of African Unity as well as the Arab League. 
  UN sanctions have been imposed on Libya following its 
refusal 
to handover the men and those involved in the bombing of a 
French private plane over Niger in 1989 which killed 170 people.

<F P=106> [Article by Rajih al-Khuri] </F>
  [Excerpts] King Husayn has no need to provoke others; he 
needs to protect himself. The conditions for building bridges 
with Israel do not include burning the bridges with what remains 
of the Arabs, in other words with Syria and Lebanon. 
  The Jordanian king did not have to hang "hang" Arab linen 
from the roof of the White House roof, because this is one of 
Israel's jobs; it has never ceased to be so. 
  Based on what has been said about his sobriety, awareness, 
reverence, and seriousness, he should not have fallen into that 
unambiguous Israeli trap. Israel laid this trap for him, first 
through the words of Shim'on Peres, who asked him to stop 
linking his stance with the Syrians, bearing in mind the king's 
involvement in the peace process, and, second, through the 
tenacious questions he was asked by Jewish journalists or by 
journalists filled with Israeli ideas. These journalists meant 
to cast doubt on the sincerity of his recent peaceful approach, 
perhaps to prompt him to adopt the sudden stance he did adopt. 
[passage omitted] 
  No one knows the reason for this exciting royal emotion, 
which reached the point of asserting that Jordan's decision on 
peace with Israel was "an issue of sovereignty concerning Jordan 
itself, one with no connection or link with any move on any 
other track." 
  Obviously it is an issue concerning Jordan. But throughout 
the area from the Ocean to the Gulf not one protest was staged. 
And no statement of denunciation was issued except by some of 
the "pan-Arab utopians" in Beirut. [passage omitted] 
  Does Husayn's acquisition of sovereignty and recognition 
justify this kind of bitter reproach to the Syrians and 
Lebanese? Did the secret bills for obtaining sovereignty and 
recognition include slapping the faces of "the brothers" and 
receiving "flowers" from the enemies' hands? Have these bills 
set out a condition that Arabs be slapped as a prelude to 
hugging the Jews? 
  There is no justification for that stance adopted by the 
king 
in the form of a free and nervy storm in the face of Damascus 
and Beirut claiming that there was someone trying to take him 
out of the Israelis' lap or take them out of his lap. In the 
era of "confrontation" the king knew how to maintain the royal 
lines of communication with the enemy. But now in this time, 
which lacks minimal levels of "steadfastness," there is no one 
who thinks of preventing Amman from competing against Jericho to 
come under the banner of the "Israeli empire." [passage omitted] 
  Do the nervous royal revelations in Washington constitute a 
departure from a "deliberate plan" to perpetuate the spirit of 
division in the Arab ranks, even if one day they came under 
Israeli command? 
  The next peaceful "delivery" will be in Washington this fall 
when King Husayn will drink from the same glass from which Anwar 
al-Sadat and Yasir 'Arafat drank before him. In the interim the 
Jordanians will encounter a very hard process and negotiations 
that will rebuild every piece of their minds and concepts, not 
least because the "sovereignty" they have gained should be in 
line with Israeli conditions. 
  We say in advance: Spare us the dirty linen over the White 
House.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline "Rabin Is Besieging 
Christopher's Mission Anew," AL-BA'TH says: When the head of 
the Israeli Government sees that there is no use for peace, this 
means he still follows the policy of separate solutions and 
partial deals and still obstructs the mission of the U.S. 
diplomat who seeks to activate the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Rabin is trying to lay siege to Christopher's 
mission to make it fail, just like his other recent tours. Rabin 
may have found an acceptance of his conditions by some who are 
going to the talks through his separate deals. Syria, however, 
is determined to adhere to its constant, principled positions 
that reject any solution that does not restore Arab rights. 
  In conclusion, AL-BA'TH says withdrawal from the Golan, 
southern Lebanon, and the rest of the occupied Arab territories 
is a primary condition for peace, stipulated by the peace 
initiative. Syria will continue to adhere to its constants and 
to its commitment to international legitimacy. It restates that 
it is not in a hurry and that the party obstructing the peace 
process will bear the consequences, sooner or later. 
  Under the headline "Rabin's Threats," TISHRIN says: The 
clearly threatening tone in Rabin's speech about opportunities 
for peace, Rabin's establishment of a timeframe for signing a 
peace agreement with Syria, and his statement that if this is 
not achieved, he will propose supplying the Israeli Army with 
weapons in preparation for the prospect of war -- all these 
threats and statements include fallacies. They represent an 
obvious attempt to falsify facts, strike a blow at the peace 
process, and raise tension in the region. 
  The paper adds: Syria has dealt with the U.S. initiative and 
the question of peace very seriously. It has made concrete 
suggestions to make progress in the peace process. 
  The paper says Rabin's statements are an obvious attempt to 
thwart the mission of the U.S. secretary before it even starts. 
TISHRIN says Rabin's threats do not frighten Syria. Everybody 
knows there can be no peace in the region without Syria. All 
the fragile agreements that have been concluded are destined to 
fail utterly if Israel does not submit to the resolutions and 
principles of international legitimacy and the foundations of 
the Madrid conference by withdrawing from all the Golan and 
southern Lebanon and restoring Arab rights. 
  TISHRIN concludes: If the peace process is to collapse 
because of Israel's intransigence and evil intentions, then 
Israel alone will be to blame for its failure. The 
international community and the parties sponsoring the peace 
process should intervene to correct things and stand up to and 
deter Israel's belligerent threats.

  [Text] Under the headline "Penetration Does Not Make 
Peace," AL-THAWRAH comments on Israel's pressures which aim to 
weaken the Lebanese national will. AL-THAWRAH stresses that 
attempts to effect a Syrian-Lebanese disengagement are doomed to 
failure. Having undergone numerous tests, the strategic 
relations between Syria and Lebanon have emerged sound and safe, 
because they reflect vital national aspirations and interests. 
  AL-THAWRAH notes that Lebanon adheres to a just, 
comprehensive peace based on UN resolutions. It will accept no 
peace without the full implementation of Resolution 425, as well 
as Resolutions 242 and 338. Lebanon is confident that its 
alliance and continued coordination and cooperation with Syria 
will thwart all Israeli attempts to weaken it. Syria and 
Lebanon have a common destiny. In its peace efforts and moves, 
Syria makes no distinction between the Golan Heights and 
southern Lebanon. It insists on the implementation of 
Resolution 242 as much as it insists on the implementation of 
Resolution 425 on Lebanon. The paper says Lebanon knows well 
that in all of Syria's peace discussions, Resolution 425 has 
been an essential part of Syrian strategy. 
  Speaking about Israel's attempts and distorted concept of 
peace, AL-THAWRAH says that what Israel frequently attempts to 
convey through its officials is not the desired peace nor the 
one provided for in the UN Security Council resolutions. For 
peace to be viable, it must comprehensive. Withdrawal from 
every inch of the Golan and withdrawal from every inch of 
southern Lebanon is the basis and prerequisite of peace; without 
it, there can be none. Israel should understand that Syria and 
Lebanon are not after just any peace. 
  If Israel believes that its penetrations on other tracks 
will 
support it against the Arabs and that it can impose its terms, 
it is undoubtedly deluded. This is because Israel deeply knows 
that there is no peace without Syria, as everyone knows.

  [Text] In its editorial, the newspaper AL-THAWRAH asserts 
that Syria, which made great efforts to promote the peace 
process, continues to adhere to its national and pan-Arab 
principles. It understands peace as meaning the restoration of 
both the land and rights and as being a just and comprehensive 
peace that ensures strength and dignity and rejects 
capitulation, bargaining, and submission. 
  The paper adds: Syria also cooperates with all international 
efforts aimed to promote the peace process and achieve its 
objectives according to the bases approved by the international 
legitimacy and its resolutions. Syria rejects any attempt to 
derail the peace process. 
  AL-THAWRAH asserts that Syria, which adheres to a just and 
comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of international 
legitimacy, will not yield to pressures or blackmail, and will 
not be dragged into the delusions of separate deals because 
Syria has always advocated pan-Arab causes. The paper notes 
that Syria has always warned and still warns against partial, 
separate deals. 
  Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: Syria, with the support of the 
masses, has become stronger in the national and pan-Arab arenas. 
Syria is today more self-confident than ever before while the 
masses are adhering to the national and pan-Arab principles on 
whose basis Syria joined the peace process. Syria even opened 
the way for this process and gave it momentum at several turning 
points.

  [Text] In its "With The Events" column, AL-BA'TH discusses 
Israel's savage attacks against southern Lebanon. The paper 
says: Israel aims to promote despair among the Lebanese over the 
futility of the legitimate means pursued by Lebanon to end the 
Israeli occupation, and, consequently, push it to submit to the 
Israeli conditions. 
  The paper adds: Israel is used to applying such pressures 
every time it finds itself encircled by an international move to 
pay the dues of peace; that is, withdrawing from the occupied 
Arab territories in accordance with the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the laws of the world community. 
But every time it retreats in failure and disappointment 
because of the Lebanese national resistance. 
  AL-BA'TH notes that if Israel managed to deal separately 
with 
a certain Arab party, it will not be able to achieve what it 
wants with Lebanon, especially since Lebanon is fortified, both 
in its internal front and by its special brotherly ties with 
Syria which are based on coordination and cooperation in all 
fields. 
  In its editorial today, TISHRIN discusses Israel's 
aggressive 
acts, which have become a daily and permanent practice in 
southern Lebanon. TISHRIN stresses that the real and natural 
response to the Israeli escalation is represented by a growth in 
the Lebanese national resistance and continuation of its 
struggle against occupation. 
  The paper says the rallying of all Lebanese people, with all 
their sects and constitutional, official, and popular 
institutions, around the Lebanese national resistance to support 
it and strengthen its legitimate role, is, undoubtedly, a 
positive phenomenon. This resistance, which defends Lebanon and 
the people, is based on a national and pan-Arab determination to 
confront Israeli arrogance with all courage and resolve to 
regain the usurped Lebanese territory in the South. 
  The paper notes that Israel's repeated provocative acts have 
made Lebanon a cohesive front against the Israeli attacks and 
against the policy of terrorism and bombardment. 
  The paper says: All signs indicate that Israel is facing a 
political defeat on the Lebanese front. It manifests this 
defeat through bombardment, continued aggression, and 
exacerbating the situation. 
  Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN stresses that Lebanon's 
cohesion and standing as a cohesive, united front behind the 
resistance and against the Israeli aggression are supported by 
all Arabs. Syria will support Lebanon and its just causes and 
defend its march toward peace and reconciliation. It will also 
continue to stick to its right to regain its territory, 
implement Resolution 425, and end the occupation of southern 
Lebanon, the Golan Heights, and the occupied Arab territories.

  [Text] In its editorial, the newspaper AL-BA'TH discusses 
the importance of the coordination, cooperation, and fraternity 
treaty concluded between the two sisterly countries of Syria and 
Lebanon. It asserts that the treaty has strengthened many 
common features between the two fraternal countries, thus 
unifying their paths and objectives. 
  AL-BA'TH adds: Among these features is the need for a joint 
confrontation of the Israeli occupation and ambitions. Both 
countries have pledged to continue coordination and 
consultations in order to liberate southern Lebanon and the 
Golan. This has been obvious since the launching of the peace 
process. Both Syria and Lebanon proved that any attempt to 
single out any party was doomed to failure because the 
leadership and people in Syria and Lebanon are fully convinced 
that what harms ones side will also harm the other. 
  AL-BA'TH asserts that the executive measures of the 
coordination and cooperation treaty have created much popular 
satisfaction, especially after the recently announced measures 
to facilitate movement at the Syrian-Lebanese border. The paper 
says this step will undoubtedly consolidate the ties between the 
citizens of the one people in the two countries.

  [Text] Member of Jordan's delegation to the Arab-Israeli 
peace negotiations Mundhir Haddadin says since 1967 Israel has 
been using all the water in the River Jordan, to which the 
kingdom has natural rights. He said because Jordan was unable 
to organize the flow of the al-Yarmuk River by constructing 
dams, Israel increased both pumping the al-Yarmuk waters for 
storage in the Tiberias lake and utilizing them directly. Mr. 
Haddadin said much of the water used by Israel from the 
al-Yarmuk River is of Jordan's rights. He said Israel uses 
about 80 million cubic meters per annum well over its natural 
rights of the river, which do not exceed irrigation of 16,000 
donums. He said considering these facts, Jordan was obliged to 
insist that water rights be included under item three of the 
joint agenda agreed upon with Israel on September 14, 1993. Mr. 
Haddadin said in order to negotiate the water issue, Jordan 
proposed a secondary agenda for detailed discussions, adding 
that this is what was agreed upon between both sides following 
four sessions of talks on June 7, 1994.

<F P=106> [Article by Caroline Faraj] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Dr. 'Abdallah Tuqan, head of the Jordanian 
side in the Security and Border Committee of the 
Jordanian-Israeli track, has asserted that a specialized team of 
technical experts will begin its work to demarcate the 
Jordanian-Israeli borders in the Wadi al-'Arabah area next July. 
  In an exclusive interview with AL-RA'Y, Dr. Tuqan added that 
the primary duty of that team, which was formed in accordance 
with Provision A of the subagenda approved on 7 June, is to 
reach an agreement to prepare the necessary maps, including any 
additional items, and to conduct joint surveys in order to 
demarcate the borders between Jordan and Israel, except the line 
separating the West Bank and the kingdom. 
  Dr. Tuqan asserted that discussion of Israel's pullout from 
the occupied Jordanian territories would begin immediately after 
the border maps were prepared. He also clarified that the 
subagenda is based on Provision B and Points 5 and 7 of the 
joint agenda of the Jordanian-Israeli track signed on 14 
September. 
  He added: In light of Provision C of the joint agenda, 
stipulating that after reaching a solution acceptable to both 
sides regarding the elements of this agenda, this solution is 
expected to be crowned with a peace treaty. This means that the 
treaty will be concluded after the bilateral negotiations 
succeed. 
  He pointed out that the solution will cover the 
international 
border, as stated in Provision 5 of Chapter B of the joint 
agenda, stipulating a settlement of the issue of territories, 
the establishment of agreed-on marks on the international border 
between Jordan and Israel by using the mandate's border 
definition without encroaching on any of the territories that 
fell under the control of the Israeli military government in 
1967, and the need for both sides to respect and abide by these 
international borders. 
  Dr. Tuqan said that this text clearly refers to the West 
Bank territory occupied in 1967, including Jerusalem. We in 
Jordan do not recognize that Israel has anything to do with the 
line dividing Jordan and the occupied Palestinian territory. He 
said that Jordan will not agree that the Palestinian autonomous 
territory be subject to negotiations on Israeli-Jordanian 
international border. 
  Tuqan noted that the surveys and preparations undertaken by 
the special subcommittee might in some cases need foreign 
expertise because its work will be separated from and in 
parallel with the other points on the agenda. Its work will be 
connected with the other committees, particularly regarding the 
projects that will be discussed after the withdrawal has been 
completed and peace has been established. 
  Tuqan emphasized the need for international border 
demarcation before any future project is broached, adding that 
the proposed road connecting Jordan, Israel, and 
Egypt--al-'Aqabah, Taba, Elat--cannot be established without 
clear borders, crossing points, security and customs posts, and 
other basic things. These have to be documented and fixed on 
maps before being implemented on the ground. 
  Tuqan noted that the border subcommittee is a mechanism or 
an 
executive body to implement points in the fifth paragraph of 
Chapter B of the joint agenda. The committee can also draw up a 
timetable to implement the necessary measures concerning 
everything agreed on between the two sides in terms of priority 
and importance. 
  Tuqan stressed that issues of borders and future projects in 
the peace era should be discussed and connections between them 
should be dealt with in detail in the upcoming Jordanian-Israeli 
negotiations. He also said that the drafting of the subagenda 
was basically based on primary points contained in the joint 
agenda; namely, realizing comprehensive, durable, and just peace 
and stressing respect for the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of the states in the region. 
  Tuqan added: This leads us to international provisions; 
namely, that the border areas of any state must be clearly 
defined so that security arrangements can be based on 
international borders. 
  He said that Jordan will not approve of the idea of 
separating sovereignty from security because the two are 
inseparable and they are two of the primary elements of 
Jordanian national security. 
  Tuqan said: It is natural that this idea of security be 
extended to include negotiations on the reduction of armaments 
and regional security, thus forming a well-connected security 
chain. 
  It is worth mentioning that the areas of the occupied 
Jordanian territories are 380.084 square kilometers in the south 
and 0.83 square kilometers in the north.

<F P=106> [Statement issued by the Muslim Brotherhood "on the </F>
Jordanian-Jewish negotiations and their results"; date not given] 
  [Text] "Men said to them: A great army is gathering 
against you, and frightened them. But it only increased their 
faith. They said: For us God sufficeth, and He is the best 
disposer of affairs. And they returned with grace and bounty 
from God. No harm ever touched them. For they followed the 
good pleasure of God, and God is the Lord of bounties unbounded. 
It is only the evil one that suggests to you the fear of his 
votaries. Be ye not afraid of them, but fear me, if ye have 
faith." [Koranic verse] 
  The Jordanian Government has announced, in an unjustified 
way, its intention to expedite the negotiations with the Zionist 
enemy, as well as its concern to reach preliminary agreements 
and detailed agendas in the fields of security, economy, and 
environment. These agreements were reached in record time and 
within a few days, as if things were prepared in advance. 
  The announcement of the agenda was accompanied by a new 
Jordanian negotiating platform which is governed by a new spirit 
and definitions which were expressed by some officials in a 
language that is not in harmony with the constants and red lines 
to which the state committed itself. This constituted real 
changes in the Jordanian negotiating policy, which will have a 
negative effect even on the extent of the Zionist "concessions!" 
over the territories and potentials usurped from Jordan which 
would be produced by these negotiations. These agreements, 
agendas, or statements recognize the Jewish enemy in terms of 
existence, state, legitimacy, and interests, and implicitly free 
this enemy from usurpation, occupation, and historical 
hostility. In addition, the enemy will be introduced to the 
regional states as if it is an Arab state. 
  The cooperation and coordination in the field of economy, 
water, security, and sovereignty in fact constitute 
normalization of relations and cooperation with the enemy in 
accordance with its demands and wishes. Such cooperation is 
unmatched by any cooperation between Jordan and any other Hebrew 
[as published] state, or even among the Arab countries 
themselves. 
  The expeditious signing of these agendas and the statements 
on separate solutions are an achievement of the enemy's 
strategy, which is based on Zionist penetration and reaching 
separate deals with each party, in order to make gains and 
become the strongest party which can apply pressure and impose 
whatever it wants on the Arab parties. 
  The Muslim Brotherhood, which announced its rejection of 
negotiations with the usurper Zionist enemy and of relinquishing 
any part of land and Arab and Islamic rights -- in view of its 
understanding of history, the nature of conflict with the 
Zionists, and the situation of the nation and the region -- 
reiterates its stand and announces its rejection of all steps, 
agreements, and agendas, which were announced, and reiterates 
the following: 
  -- The contents of the detailed agendas on security, 
environment, and tourism are the inauguration of normalization 
with the Zionist enemy and the laying down of foundations for 
cooperation with the enemy before it even acknowledges Jordan's 
rights and their dimensions, not to mention restoring them. 
This is considered a consent to the Zionist view and an 
achievement of its famous slogan: Peace for peace. 
  This leads to wasting the nation's rights to the 
territories and holy places that the enemy has usurped to 
establish its entity. This also leads to forcing cooperation 
and normalization, which are impossible to rescind in case the 
Zionists refuse to recognize all our rights. All this is a 
departure from the basis of the negotiations and a risky gamble 
involving national rights with an enemy well versed in treachery 
and revoking charters and conventions. 
  --What is taking place reflects a state of anxiousness to 
approach the Zionist entity first in order to achieve some gains 
for fear that some may fall in the Zionist lap at the expense of 
some of Jordan's rights. 
  --What we fear most is for the Jordanian-Israeli 
negotiations 
to turn into a Jordanian Oslo accord, which would serve Zionist 
schemes and meet the Zionist objective of having separate deals, 
exactly as the Palestinian Oslo accord did. 
  --The declared justifications for this negotiatory 
acceleration do not give the government the right to take steps 
for which Jordan will pay in terms of its Arab relations, 
especially since Jordan is suffering from closed doors with most 
Arab neighbors. Is it reasonable for the government to run 
behind Zionist promises and deceptive plans and block its 
relations with certain Arabs? This is unreasonable, regardless 
of other's calculations and intentions, which are known by 
nobody but God. 
  --We believe that what is going on will lead to a separate 
solution. This is practically the opposite of the comprehensive 
solution that the government is talking about, regardless of its 
attempts to justify its acts. 
  We urge the regimes and peoples to face up to those 
challenges and to maintain the nation's rights, sovereignty, and 
wealth, which are not the property of a single generation, but 
of all generations. 
  We realize that the nation's current weakness is a transient 
state of affairs, which does not justify compliance and 
relinquishing rights. This weakness can be overcome by resolve, 
adequate management, patience, and further cohesion, freedom, 
and justice. Above all, we should hold fast to God's approach 
and be united under His laws and course. 
  In its long history, the nation has experienced times of 
greater weakness. It did not surrender, however, but instead 
maintained a high spirit of jihad and put up a valiant 
resistance, thus overcoming its weaknesses and emerging 
stronger, thanks to its faith in God and then to the efforts of 
its faithful sons. 
  We urge the people to reject all past and subsequent 
destructive political settlement agreements, not to comply with 
the enemy's will, and to resist those agreement's subsequent 
effects. 
  "Call to mind when ye were a small band, despised through 
the 
land, and afraid that men might despoil and kidnap you; but He 
provided a safe asylum for you, strengthened you with His aid, 
and gave you good things for sustenance: That ye might be 
grateful. O ye that believe! Betray not the trust of God and 
the Apostle, nor misappropriate knowingly things entrusted to 
you." [koranic verse] 
  God is great. God be praised.

<F P=106> [By Faysal al-Shubul] </F>
  [Text] Amman -- Forty Jordanian House of Representatives 
members have decided to resort to a new method in opposing Dr. 
'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali's government in spite of the latter's 
attempt to overhaul his government by appointing 18 new 
ministers, 10 of whom are House members. 
  The new method is to directly address King Husayn as the 
head 
of the three branches of power and explain the legislative 
branch's stand without resorting to the option of a vote of 
confidence which will, undoubtedly, lead to a constitutional 
crisis in the country that may topple not only the government 
but the House as well. 
  Engineer 'Ali Abu-al-Raghib, a former minister and a 
centrist deputy, told AL-WASAT: We will act more responsibly 
than the prime minister. He was referring to the relationship 
between the government and the House of Representatives, most of 
whose members feel that al-Majali has been ignoring the House 
since he formed his government in May 1993, and that he has not 
succeeded in changing his approach in spite of the three 
government reshuffles he has carried out. 
  Tasked by 40 House members, nine deputies, including 
Abu-al-Raghib, are drafting a letter, the first of its kind in 
the constitutional history of Jordan, that they will address to 
the Jordanian monarch. 
  Abu-al-Raghib described the letter as worthy both in form 
and 
content and revolves around three basic elements: 
  The first emphasizes that the deputies do not want either to 
hold another extraordinary session or submit a vote of 
no-confidence in the government; meaning that they do not seek 
to topple the government through parliament. 
  The second element stresses that the deputies are aware that 
the exacerbation of the crisis will have a negative impact not 
only on the domestic level but also on the level of Jordan's 
foreign relations and its tackling of various issues, including 
the peace process. 
  The third element outlines the deputies understanding of how 
institutional relationships should be and how this calls for 
normal relations between the executive and legislative branches 
with an emphasis that the deputies have grasped the requirements 
of the current stage which is governed by the peace negotiations 
on the one hand and the economic pressures on the other. 
  In the prime minister's third reshuffle, two out of the 18 
new ministers drew attention for agreeing to join the 
government. The first is Dhuqan al-Hindawi, who has been 
appointed minister and deputy prime minister in many previous 
governments over the past 30 years, and who repeatedly refused 
to join al-Majali's government. The second is 'Abd-al-Ra'uf 
al-Rawabidah, who not only voted against the al-Majali 
government, but has been one of its most prominent opposers, and 
has mobilized many deputies against it. 
  Al-Hindawi and al-Rawabidah would not have accepted to join 
the government without the intervention of King Husayn and Crown 
Prince Hasan to convince them of the importance of their 
participation to face the challenges of the current stage with a 
strong government. 
  The reshuffle was made in accordance with an idea that 
al-Majali be devoted to administer the negotiations, in which 
representation will not only be upgraded to the level of prime 
minister and foreign minister (al-Majali is foreign minister in 
addition to his post as prime minister) but will be shifted to 
the region as Prince Hasan announced. 
  According to Jordanian officials, the Gulf of Aqaba, where 
al- 'Aqabah and Ilat cities are situated close to each other, 
will be the arena of the Jordanian-Israeli negotiations on 
border demarcation and sovereignty that will start next July. 
  Al-Hindawi's condition for accepting to join the government 
was that the government should include House of Representatives 
members, which was something opposed by al-Majali when he formed 
the government, so his government did not enjoy much 
parliamentary support. 
  But the admission of 10 House of Representatives members 
into 
the government did not increase its supporters because of 
al-Majali method in selecting these members. Instead of 
consulting with the parliamentary blocs for their 
representatives to join the government, he chose 10 deputies 
through personal contacts. Furthermore, he tried without success 
to convince a Muslim Brotherhood deputy, who is 'Abd-al-Karim 
'Ukur, to join the government. 
  One day after the government reshuffle was announced, the 
deputies were furious, including the deputies of the bloc led by 
the prime minister's brother Engineer 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Majali. 
Forty-one deputies, out of 80, met and announced their 
opposition to the method in which the government was reshuffled. 
  It was decided to prorogue the parliament's extraordinary 
session as of 16 June, hence the parliament went into its summer 
break. But the Jordanian Constitution allows the majority to 
call for another extraordinary session to discuss specific 
issues. 
  Hence, the deputies resorted to a new method in opposing the 
government which advocates the principle of "keeping both the 
wolf and the sheep alive" as said one of the nine deputies who 
are preparing the message to the king. 
  Therefore, al-Majali's government is finding itself once 
again facing opposition. While it may be true that the 
opposition does not seek to topple the government, it will keep 
it under close scrutiny and mobilize public opinion against it.

scene of heavy clashes between the forces loyal to the president 
and supporters of Afghanistan's prime minister. At the same 
time, dozens of missiles were fired on various parts of Kabul. 
  General Dostam's fighter jets, by dropping bombs weighing 
several hundreds kg, also shook the capital of Afghanistan. 
These attacks caused considerable damage and left 13 people 
dead and wounded in the central part of Kabul. 
  Afghanistan's Defense Ministry reported that a fighter 
aircraft belonging to General Dostam was shot down. [passage

  [Text] The Golboddin-Dostam militia's attacks were aborted 
in Qala-e Ahmad Khan, and a large area was cleared up in Karta-e 
Naw [southeast of Kabul]. Reports received by the Bakhtar 
Information Agency [BIA] say that forces of the Islamic army 
were consolidating their positions in the course of the day, and 
they crushed two attacks by the Golboddin-Dostam militia in 
Qala-e Ahmad Khan. As a result a number of the militia were 
killed. 
  According to a report by BIA, calm has resumed in Kabul, and 
the refugees of the city are returning to their homes in the old 
Microrayon and Shah-Shahid. The report says that a large number 
of Kabul's refugees who had gone to Jalalabad six months ago are 
returning to their places. Over the past three days the Islamic 
army's conquests have removed militia's heavy weapons positions 
from the city. They can hardly cause trouble to the people, as 
a result. However, the conquests have put urgent tasks on the 
shoulders of the state. The reconstruction of the conquered 
areas, most of which have become ruins, the reactivation of the 
police security zones, and the construction of educational and 
health institution in those areas rest at the top of the list of 
programs. 
  The report adds that the danger has not completely been 
eliminated, but that the Golboddin-Dostam militia threaten 
residential areas through their stealthy attacks. According to 
reports, in a crowded area of the city 13 residents of Kabul 
were martyred as a result of three bombs dropped by a jet 
airplane. The raid took place at 0800 this morning. As a 
result, three shops were damaged. 
  According to an authentic source, strong words were 
exchanged 
two days ago between Golboddin and Dostam in a radio 
conversation, and militia's scandalous defeat in Kabul has been 
considered its real reason. 
  In the course of a face-to-face battle, six foreign citizens 
were killed and seven others have been captured. A BIA 
correspondent who had personally spoken to the prisoners 
reported to us that the prisoners were taken by mojahedin in the 
area of Kara-e Naw. Despite the fact that senior state 
authorities have spoken about the existence of foreign citizens, 
and the Islamic army reported their capture, this is the first 
time that reporters have been allowed to see the prisoners and 
to photograph them. The prisoners have given their names as 
follows: Naddem Shahzad, from Mianbagh in Punjab; Sayed Ahmad, 
from Punjab; Mohammad Aziz, from Sailkot in Punjab; Farhatnur, 
from Multan; Abed Saleem, from Karachi; Jawed Akhtar, from 
Peshawar; Bahram Khan, from Peshawar. Nadeem Shahzad says that 
he has lost six of his friends in the course of the battle whose 
bodies were left in the battlefield.

<F P=106> [Interview with military commanders by unidentified </F>
radio/television correspondent at locations around Kabul on 28 
June; passages in italics in Pashto -- recorded] 
  [Excerpts] [Correspondent] Dear viewers of television and 
dear listeners of Radio Afghanistan; may the peace and blessing 
of God be upon you. I hope that you are in a good health and 
are being successful. As you can see, we are now in Seya Sang 
Neqleya [near Kabul]. Not only the members of the armed forces' 
various units, but mojahedin of the various provinces also took 
part in this victorious operation. The mojahedin of Kapisa also 
took active part in this operation. I will interview one of the 
most famous commanders of this province -- commander Habib 
Afghan. May we draw your attention to this interview: 
  Esteemed commander, would you please tell me about the 
role of your mojahedin in the recent victories? 
  [Habib Afghan] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. We -- the mojahedin of Kapisa -- have been 
taking part in the operation since the beginning of the 
revolution but most actively since the coup launched by the 
Dostam and Golboddin. Recently we took part in the operation 
carried out in Seya Sang. Here we seized six tanks [word 
indistinct] rifles, and a large quantity of ammunition in these 
depots. We seized an enormous amount of ammunition in other 
depots for example: in Kasa Borj and Tapa-e Nader Khan we seized 
a countless amount of ammunition. All the enemy's supplies were 
seized by the mojahedin. [passage indistinct] The enemy have 
lost their morale and we should not put our guns down until 
their final defeat. We must work hard for the victory of our 
jihad. 
  [Correspondent] Esteemed commander, please tell us 
where your forces are stationed, and how long will you continue 
your operation? 
  [Habib Afghan] My own forces are stationed in the Seya 
Sang region. This region was under the control of 
Dostam/Golboddin forces. We are not going to put down our guns 
while Dostam is in this land and Golboddin does not repent from 
his evil actions. We are not going to make any more 
concessions. We have given many concessions in the past. They 
fought sometimes in the name of Islam and sometimes under the 
pretext of militia. In every name they have been fighting 
against Muslims. Look at these houses yourself? Who were 
living in these houses -- Muslims or non-Muslims? They have 
looted all these houses and set them on fire. We cannot put 
down our guns until we (?expose) all their evils. As long as 
our nation is on our side -- Almighty God is with us -- we are 
on the right side. They are not prepared to compromise; they 
are not prepared for peace; they are not prepared for Loya 
Jerga. [passage indistinct] They are foreign agents. I have 
captured three Pakistani men here -- in Seya Sang -- myself. 
They are now under arrest; if you want I will show them to you. 
If disputes are going on in our country, what are Pakistani men 
doing here? What are the Americans are doing here [as heard]? 
What are the Arabs doing here? We are Muslims and we are not 
infidels. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] As you can see, we are now in Tapa-e Naqleya 
Seya Sang. We want to interview a commander in this unit. 
Esteemed commander, please introduce yourself to the viewers of 
television and esteemed listeners of Radio Afghanistan. 
  [Safiollah] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. My name is Safiollah, commander of Battalion 40, 
Bagram Division. 
  [Correspondent] Please tell us about the duties you are 
going 
to accomplish after the operation? 
  [Safiollah] On 25 June, we received an order from the 
Islamic 
State of Afghanistan and the Ministry of Defense. Our mojahedin 
captured localities from Jada-e Maywand [in Kabul] to Chaman and 
up to Tapa-e Maranjan. And now we are here; as you can see, we 
are stationed in Tapa-e Seya Sang. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] We are continuing our interview, as you can 
see we are now in Chaman. A number of our brethren of the first 
district are stationed in here. I am going to interview the 
esteemed commander of District 1 [as heard]. Esteemed commander, 
above all tell us something about the clearing up operation 
carried out by the army of the Islamic State of Afghanistan? 
  [Unidentified commander] In the name of God, the merciful, 
the compassionate, [passage indistinct] the Islamic State 
attacked the area held by the Dostam-Golboddin militia. In 
stationing our forces in Chaman, our groups began to advance 
toward Seya Sang region. With the help of God these people were 
wiped out from Bala Hesar region and now we can safely advance 
toward Charasiab. [passage omitted] 
  Our brethren of the Islamic State are planning to advance 
toward Charasiab. This place must be cleared of enemies so that 
the poor and persecuted people of Kabul can be relieved from the 
fighting and difficulties. [passage omitted] 
  [Correspondent] Dear listeners, as you know the army of the 
Islamic State of Afghanistan have been carrying out clearing up 
operations during the past two or three days in the direction of 
Tapa-e Maranjan, Bala Hesar, Pol-e Charkhi, and Arzan Qemat, and 
the units and companies of the Islamic State's Army achieved 
enormous gains. One of these units who took active part in this 
military operation and achieved enormous gain is Unit 622 or 
Regiment 622 of the national guard of the Islamic State of 
Afghanistan. We are now conducting an interview with esteemed 
Gol Hayder, the commander of Regiment 622 of the National Guard 
of the Islamic State of Afghanistan. May we draw your attention 
to this interview. Esteemed commander, please give us 
information regarding the recent mopping up operation, and could 
you also tell us about the duties of your regiment, their 
location, and what have their gains been? 
  [Gol Hayder] In the name of God, the merciful, the 
compassionate. The enemy had a plan to attack our unit on 23 
June at 0500 in the vicinity of Pol-e Mahmud Khan. We had 
advance information regarding this plan. Our units saw duty in 
various locations. The enemy intended to attack, but with the 
blessing of God, before they attacked we took the initiative. 
We attacked first Darwaza-ye Lahori and Dahan-e Jada. There 
the enemy could not resist even for one or two hours. The 
positions that they held for the last two years, we seized them 
the first day -- places like Darwaza-e Lahori and Dahan-e Jada. 
Over the hill, there were other units who captured Bala Hesar. 
The next morning at 0600 we attacked Ghazi Stadium. The enemy 
could not resist even for five minutes. After five minutes, we 
entered Kabul Theater. Then, jointly with our brethren from 
Ettehad-e Eslami [Islamic Union of Afghanistan], we quickly 
seized Tapa-ye Maranjan from the enemy who put the Kabul 
citizens in pain and difficulties for the last two years, but 
now with the help and blessing of God were defeated, and they 
could not resist in these regions even for two hours. We have 
taken these places from them. 
  [Correspondent] How do you assess the enemy morale, in 
particular the militia morale in comparison to the early days of 
the fighting, when you launched a clearing up operation? 
  [Gol Hayder] God is with us. Hekmatyar did not seek refuge 
from the God but he sought refuge from Dostam. As you know, a 
few days ago he gave a warning to the people in Kabul of his 
large scale fighting and his intention to capture Kabul. When 
we took action we found that he is nothing. He sought refuge to 
Dostam whereas he did not resist even for five minutes; his 
forces will be nothing to us -- with the help of God. 
  [Correspondent] Have you any information from the Pol-e 
Charkhi direction? Are the units of the Islamic army advancing 
in this direction? 
  [Gol Hayder] Earlier I was in Tapa-ye Maranjan; the area of 
Dehkhodaydad and the hill of Dehkhodaydad, this large area was 
cleared up on the first day. Now our mojahedin are advancing 
toward Arzanqimat and over the hill of Bagrami. 
  [Correspondent] What is the enemy doing? Are they resisting 
or fleeing? 
  [Gol Hayder] We see no resistance from the enemy. The fact 
that Dostam lost his two-year-long held position in a few 
minutes and could not resist, they could not resist even for 
three minutes in Dahan-e Jada, in Daramsal-e Kohna and in Shah-e 
Shahid held by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan]. 
They could not resist, but have escaped. 
  [Correspondent] Thank you, esteemed commander. I wish you 
and all mojahed brethren success and victory.

  [Text] Islamabad, June 27, IRNA -- Any new initiatve for 
restoring peace in wartorn Afghanistan should also take into 
account the suggestions of all those persons who are not related 
to the well-known Afghan groups. 
  This was stated by the United Nations secretary general's 
representative for Afghanistan, Sotirios Mousouris in an 
exclusive interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) 
in the Pakistani capital. 
  Without disclosing the contents of report of the U.N. 
special 
mission on Afghanistan led by former Tunisian Foreign Minister 
Mehmood Mestiri, he said one could have good ideas to formulate 
a peace plan out of this report. However, he said it was up to 
the U.N. secretary general to decide whether the world body 
should make a peace plan for Afghanistan or not. 
  Mousouris said a large segment of the Afghan nation has 
sought the help of the United Nations that range from demands 
for intervention to end foreign interference to the making of a 
peace plan and then its implementation. 
  Answering a question as to what he considered would happen 
in 
Afghanistan after July 28, the end of President Borhanoddin 
Rabbani's term in office, he said it is up to Afghans themselves 
to resolve their problems. However, he said, countries such as 
Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia should also be consulted in this 
regard as they brokered the Islamabad accord between Afghan 
groups. 
  Mousouris said complete ceasefire is a pre-requisite for 
sorting out political solution to the conflict. He also 
expressed his apprehensions that Herat City was bombed before it 
hosted a meeting of Afghan leaders to deliberate on the problem 
to figure out its solution. He said it seemed some persons are 
not interested to discuss any peace plan. 
  To a question as to what could be a permanent solution to 
the 
crisis, he said the Afghan youth do not have jobs in the wake of 
fighting and thus are forced to affiliate with warring factions 
to piece out their livehood. 
  He said international assistance for Afghanistan has also 
gone down because of instability. He said he could not propose 
any plan or solution to the crisis but the ideas of the "silent 
Afghan majority" are to be taken into consideration in any peace 
formula meant for restoring peace and stability in that 
war-ravaged country.

  [Text] Tehran, June 29, IRNA -- Iran's foreign Ministry 
Tuesday [28 June] categorically denied allegations made by the 
Zionist regime on the presence of an Israeli pilot in Iran and 
termed it as "sheer lie". 
  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and the Zionist 
regime's 
Air Force commander recently had claimed that Ron Arad, an 
Israeli pilot whose plane crashed in 1986 while bombarding south 
Lebanon, is in Iran. 
  An informed source at the Foreign Ministry in a contact with 
IRNA categorically rejected the allegations and stressed "the 
Zionists were following other objectives by repeating such 
baseless and unfounded claims."

  [Text] Tehran, June 28, (IRNA) -- The second round of 
inter-Tajik negotiations on national reconciliation concluded 
its work here Tuesday [28 June] with the involved parties 
emphasizing their commitment to the political dialogue as the 
only means of achieving national reconcilitaion. 
  A joint statement issued at the end of the talks indicated 
that the parties elaborating their viewpoints during the talks 
have agreed on the definition of the notion of the ceasefire and 
the cessation of hostile acts. 
  Consensus was reached on the temporary nature of the 
agreement (for the period of negotiations up to October 1, 1994) 
and the questions related to the establishment of a 
comprehensive control mechanism for the temporary ceasefire and 
cessation of hostile acts, the statement said. 
  The statement added, in spite of good will and flexibility 
displayed by both parties and the reciprocal compromise steps 
proposed, it was nevertheless not possible to reach a consensus 
on the agreement, however the text was practically agreed. 
  The Tajik Government delegation headed by minister of labor 
and employment, Zukhurov, insisted on the necessity of the 
ceasefire and cessation of other hostile acts immediately upon 
the signing of the agreement and undertook to implement the 
conditions of the opposition delegation within a peroid during 
which a ceasefire is in force. 
  Whereas the delegation of the Tajik opposition headed by Mr. 
O. Latifi in its turn insisted on the necessity of a 
simultaneous entry into force of the ceasefire agreement and the 
implementation of the governement conditions. 
  He also called for simultaneous release of persons detained, 
arrested and sentenced, dismissal of all criminal cases 
initiated in connection with politicial confrontation and the

  [Text] Tehran, June 28, (IRNA) -- Deputy Foreign Minister 
Abbas Maleki here Tuesday [28 June] refuted claims by certain 
Western mass media that the peace talks on Tajikistan held in 
Tehran have failed, saying the West did not want Iran to play a 
pivotal role in the negotiations. 
  Maleki, a deputy for research and training, said that not 
only the Tehran talks have been a success but they have also 
indicated Iran's key role in tackling regional problems. 
  The West intends to play down any peace efforts being made 
in 
the absence of Western organizations, the deputy foreign 
minister reiterated. 
  Although the West wants the crisis in Tajikistan to be 
settled by Western countries, the success of the Tehran talks 
was such that even the especial envoy of the U.N. secretary 
general, R. Piriz Ballon confirmed it, he added. 
  According to Maleki, the bases for national reconciliation 
were laid in the second round of peace talks on Tajikistan held 
in Tehran from June 18-28. 
  Maleki said that the two parties involved in the peace talks 
agreed upon the definition of the notion of the ceasefire, the 
terms for ceasefire, the release of political prisoners, freedom 
of the press, public amnesty and renewal of activities of 
political parties. 
  Stressing the political dialogue as the only solution to the 
problems of Tajikistan, Maleki said that the Tajik Government 
was well aware that the development of that country was tied to 
achievement of a lasting peace.

  [Text] Following recent remarks by Shaykh Hamdan, the UAE's 
minister of state for foreign affairs, which once again 
reiterated that country's baseless claims, the spokesman of our 
country's Foreign Affairs Ministry has stressed Iran's 
sovereignty over the three Iranian islands [in the Gulf]. 
  Mr Mohammadi said: Repeating such baseless issues, which 
undermine the process of consolidation of stability in the 
region, serves only the interests of foreigners and helps the 
Zionist regime spread its influence in the region. 
  He added: Expansion of ties and cooperation does not mean 
serving one-sided interests. Instead, such a process embraces 
the mutual interests of the two neighboring Muslim countries, 
and in the opinion of the Islamic Republic of Iran, expansion of 
ties requires that one should refrain from making territorial 
claims, and should instead pay respect to the issues of 
sovereignty and established frontiers. 
  Furthermore, he stressed: Instead of attention to propaganda 
issues, it is better for the UAE to accept the Islamic Republic 
of Iran's invitation to hold bilateral talks.

  [Text] Tehran, June 29, IRNA -- Two Persian dailies today 
commented on the recent claims by the United Arab Emirates on 
the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf and said that such 
claims had no impact other than straining bilateral ties. 
  UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shaykh Hamdan 
[Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan] in a recent interview repeated the 
baseless claims over the three Iranian islands of Abu Musa, 
Greater and Lesser Tonbs. 
  `JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI' in an article said that the statements 
had no reasonable basis otherwise the UAE officials would not 
have refrained from holding direct talks with Iran. The paper 
said that Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati visited the UAE 
at the invitation of his counterpart last year to know about the 
UAE stance. But the UAE officials did not utter a word about 
the islands during Velayati's lengthy talks there. After 
Velayati's return to Tehran and contrary to the articles of the 
joint communique, the UAE officials resumed their claims over 
the islands. 
  Referring to the invitation extended to the UAE ruler Shaykh 
Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan to visit Tehran, the article said 
that his refusal to pay a visit to Tehran was an indication to 
the fact that the UAE is not following a documented claim but 
rather a propaganda ballyhoo which not only is not in the 
interest of the region but makes it apt for the Zionist 
influence. 
  Turning to Shaykh Hamdan's statement that the issue will be 
referred to international tribunals, the paper criticized that 
the UAE officials first called for direct talks but now have 
changed their view and stressed that they do not follow a steady 
policy. 
  "If we review history and the time when colonialism had not 
found its way to the region, we will find out that at that time 
not only the islands belonged to Iran but also no country under 
the name of the UAE existed in the region," JOMHURI said. It is 
generous of Tehran that it is not following the policy of 
changing the present borders among regional countries in an 
attempt to preserve the security and stability of the region, it 
concluded. 
  Another Persian daily, `ABRAR' said on the same topic that 
Shaykh Hamdan talked about the international court of 
arbitration where the very existence of the UAE could be 
questioned -- a sheikhdom a little older than two decades which 
is now raising territorial claims. The United Arab Emirates, 
comprising several sheikhdoms, was a British protectorate until 
1971. Since then Britain brought to power one of the nomadic 
tribes and turned it to a sheikhdom. it covers not more than 
830,000 sq. kms and its population including native Arabs and 
immigrants from Pakistan, India and other countries does not 
exceed 1,800,000. 
  The interview of Shaykh Hamdan, son of Shaykh Zayid, was 
published by all the media financed by Saudi Arabia and 
extensive propaganda was made on this claim.

  [Excerpt] President Geydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan arrived in 
Tehran this morning at the head of a high-ranking political, 
economic, social, and cultural delegation. He was formally 
welcomed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. 
  After arriving in Tehran Mr. Aliyev, in an interview with 
our 
correspondent, referred to the Islamic Republic of Iran [IRI] 
and our country's revolutionary people as the friends and 
sincere brothers of the Azerbaijan Republic. Referring to the 
two countries' common historical, national, and religious 
background, he said: We attach great importance to the IRI as an 
influential and powerful neighbor and we would like the two 
countries to expand ties in all fields. The president of 
Azerbaijan added that during his stay in our country he will 
hold talks with President Hashemi-Rafsanjani and other IRI 
officials on the most significant regional and international 
issues and the expansion of the two countries' relations. 
  On the axes of talks with Azerbaijan's president and the two 
countries' ties, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: 
  [Begin Hashemi-Rafsanjani recording] In the name of God, the 
compassionate, the merciful. We are very close to Azerbaijan in 
every respect. Our people feel solidarity [yeganegi] in both 
countries. At present the level of our ties is very good too. 
During my visit to Baku -- frankly -- among the authorities, 
with Mr. Aliyev himself, and among the people I felt as if they 
were like our own people. Fortunately many of the decisions we 
took during that visit are currently being implemented. Of 
course some of the important decisions require time for 
implementation. We have had some memoranda of understanding, 
which we will pursue during this visit. 
  To us the problem of military conflict in Caucasia is highly 
significant. One of the subjects of our talks, therefore, will 
be the same issues of Karabakh and the problems of Caucasia in 
general. 
  Among our important issues are cooperation in the Caspian 
Sea 
and greater utilization of the joint river of Aras. There are 
the issues of transit, trade and exchange visits by our people. 
Almost all the issues that the two countries are interested in 
and eager to discuss will be discussed during this visit. We 
hope that just like my trip to Baku, the visit of his excellency 
the president of Azerbaijan to Tehran will also be a great 
stride in the expansion of cooperation. [end recording] [passage

  [Text] Tehran, June 28, IRNA -- A new commission called the 
`Islamic Human Rights Commission' is to be established by the 
judiciary system to follow up issues related to the Islamic 
countries, said Head of the Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi 
here Tuesday [28 June]. 
  Speaking at the closing session of the nationwide seminar on 
`Judiciary Week,' the Ayatollah noted that if faced with any 
case of violation of Islamic human rights inside or outside the 
country, the commission "will have the authority to use its 
capabiities to settle the problem." 
  Addressing the participants, Yazdi described as "acceptable" 
the body's performance in the past five years, adding that the 
judiciary system was looking after people's affairs very 
actively in the said period. 
  Further in his talks, the Ayatollah said that fewer cases 
were referred to the state Supreme Court in the past five years 
and added that some 33,279 inmates have been pardoned in the 
said period. 
  He said his term in office is going to be over, adding that 
he would be happy if the burden were to be shouldered by someone 
else.

  [Begin al-'Arashi recording] I have come carrying a message 
from His Excellency Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council in the Republic of Yemen, 
to his brother His Majesty King Hassan II. 
  As you know, Yemen is going through special circumstances, 
therefore it was necessary to brief his majesty on the 
development of the situation, particularly that the brother 
president attaches special interest to his majesty's 
point-of-view. 
  We also certainly start from the premise that the Kingdom of 
Morocco, king, government, and people, stand beside Yemen and 
its national unity and the unity of its Yemeni territory, 
therefore it is necessary to put them in the picture for more 
consultations over the consultations that are currently taking 
place at the level of the Arab and Yemeni arenas. 
  It is a good opportunity to know the view point and also 
clarify the stance directly. [end recording]

Marseilles. 
  King Hassan affirms in his speech that he believes in the 
decentralization of management and that democracy starts at 
local level before becoming national. He emphasizes the role of 
the elected municipal officials and cadres and that of appointed 
officials such as governors, pointing out that they should work 
hand in hand for the good of local inhabitants. The king calls 
for following up the work and recommendations made in 
conferences like this one. He also underlines the positive role 
of nonpolitical local organizations in helping to bring about 
local welfare: members of such organizations can teach, 
enlighten, and travel abroad to encourage investment and tourism. 
  The king concludes his speech by stressing there must not be 
animosity between appointed and elected local officials. They 
should work together and cooperate when approaching ministries. 
The king spoke for 28 minutes and he then shakes hands with and 
chats to delegates.

  [Text] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--Information Minister Safwat 
al-Sharif denied press reports that an Egyptian ship carrying 
Saudi weapons to Aden was stopped in the Red Sea before reaching 
its destination. 
  In a statement made today, al-Sharif said: No Egyptian ship 
has been stopped either in the Red Sea or in the Mediterranean 
Sea. He stressed that this report is entirely baseless and 
contradicts Egypt's firm and principled stand on the Yemeni 
problem. He said that Egypt believes the need to immediately 
stop the fighting and to move to the dialogue table. He added 
that Egypt also believes that it is not right to side with one 
party against the other in this problem.

  [Excerpt] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--Ambassador Sa'id Rif'at, 
assistant foreign minister for African affairs, has again denied 
that Egypt supplied the Rwandan Government with arms. 
  Responding to claims by the Rwandan Patriotic Front that 
Egypt is providing the government with weapons and that Egypt 
has endorsed a Security Council resolution to send troops to 
Rwanda to appease France, Rif'at made a statement today 
affirming that Egypt favors no side to the conflict in Rwanda. 
  He said there is a question mark over the Rwandan Patriotic 
Front's insistence on accusing Egypt of providing the government 
there with weapons despite Egypt's assertion that it is not. 
  He added that Egypt supported Security Council Resolution 
929 
on the intervention of a UN force with a humanitarian task to 
protect the refugees and the displaced in Rwanda relying on 
practical and objective considerations, primarily Egypt's desire 
to ensure protection and security for endangered civilians with 
emphasis on the humanitarian nature of the mission. [passage

the Egyptian-European Cooperation Council in Brussels last 
month. This decision is seen as support for cooperation between 
Egypt and the EU.

  [Text] Security organs have thwarted a terrorist scheme 
planned abroad to carry out sabotage activities against some 
installations and assassinate a number of personalities in 
Egypt. The execution of this plan was entrusted to some 
terrorists who were trained in foreign countries. The State 
Security Investigations' Bureau succeeded in arresting some 
members who were attempting to infiltrate through an Egyptian 
port. It seized all their documents and files, as well as the 
passports the defendants used in their travels to numerous 
countries. 
  A ranking security source told AL-AHRAM correspondent Ahmad 
Musa that confessions by the terrorist group revealed that their 
leadership, which has fled abroad, dispatched them inside the 
country after the successful security blows dealt to terrorist 
leaders 'Awad Siyam and Tal'at Yasin Hammam. The members of 
this group were asked to convey very detailed instructions to 
the terrorist leaders' aides inside, as well as to transfer 
funds. These funds were to be used to carry out terrorist 
operations to make the terrorist presence in the arena known.

  [Text] In a new strike reflecting the security authorities' 
alert, a sabotage cell of six terrorists coming from Pakistan 
was arrested as its members tried to infiltrate the country 
through Cairo Airport using forged passports. 
  A senior security source told AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I that 
preliminary investigations with cell members revealed that 
terrorist leaders abroad sought to revive terrorist activity in 
Egypt after the security agencies destroyed clandestine 
terrorist organizations and eliminated their masterminds, 
primarily the al-Jihad Organization. 
  The source added that the sabotage cell members had arrived 
to regroup the terrorists and resume attacks on important 
popular sites to cause the greatest possible damage and prove to 
people at home and abroad that they still exist. 
  The source affirmed that $6,000 and sketches of targeted 
installations were seized with the group in addition to several 
bank account numbers to which the necessary funds are 
transferred from abroad.

<F P=106> [Report by Sulayman 'Abd-al-'Azim] </F>
  [Text] In a sudden development within the Liberal Party, 
Wahid Ghazi, chief editor of the weekly edition of AL-AHRAR last 
Saturday [18 June] tendered his resignation to Liberal Party 
leader Mustafa Kamil Murad. Murad's secretary refused to 
acknowledge official receipt of the resignation, forcing Ghazi 
to send it with a bailiff on Sunday morning to the party, but 
party officials also refused to acknowledge receipt of the 
resignation. 
  Having failed to get either the party leader, or the party 
itself, to recognize his resignation, Ghazi again asked a 
bailiff from the Public Prosecution Office to hand the 
resignation either to the party leader or the party's 
secretariat. 
  AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that Ghazi's resignation is due to 
his disapproval of the party's recent shift from liberal to 
Nasirist and fundamentalist policies. Ghazi says that the 
change is unprecedented and contradicts the party's program. 
  Party leader Murad this week ordered the discontinuation of 
the weekly edition of AL-AHRAR, the newspaper for which Ghazi 
served as chief editor for the past 14 years. 
  Murad also appointed Ghazi as chief editor of the daily [as 
published] newspaper AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH. It is worth noting 
that AL-USRAH AL-'ARABIYAH basically functions as a vehicle for 
legal announcements. 
  Speaking to AL-MUSAWWAR, Ghazi said: We respect the 
Nasirists and anyone whose political views vary with ours. But 
we are against sudden changes of the party's program and 
orientation about which party members are not consulted. It is 
unacceptable for one person to make party members alter their 
principles and doctrine against their will. Such actions 
violate the law of political parties.

  [Excerpt] The two warring parties in Yemen have met in New 
York for the first time since the outbreak of the conflict. The 
northern party was represented by 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani 
[minister of planning and development] and the southern party 
was represented by Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas [prime minister of 
the government declared in south Yemen]. The meeting was 
attended by the UN envoy to Yemen, Lakhdar Brahimi, who called 
on them to set a date for cease-fire. Al-Iryani, however, did 
not have full authorization from Sanaa to make such a decision, 
as Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas said in his statements to reporters 
following the meeting. 
  The meeting was not in vain, because it brought closer the 
two sides' viewpoints on the formation of the committee which 
will supervise the cease-fire. REUTER cited Abu-Bakr al-'Attas 
as saying: We have almost reached an agreement on the Arab, 
African, and Asian countries which would participate in this 
committee. Al-Iryani suggested that both France and the United 
States participate in this committee. Both sides agreed -- 
through al-Iryani and al- 'Attas -- that the observers operate 
under the supervision of Lakhdar Brahimi with the assistance of 
a military attache. The obstacle, however, was represented in 
the southern party's insistence that the observers operate under 
the UN flag. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 28 Jun (INA) -- The forces of the legitimate 
Yemeni Government have seized control of significant areas in 
the northern part of Jabal Hadid, the most heavily-fortified 
stronghold of the separatists in Aden, which overlooks the city 
of al-Ma'ashiq, in which the house of archseparatist 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid is located. 
  An IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Sanaa today quoted 
reports and military sources in Aden as saying that the forces 
of the legitimate Yemeni Government have managed to completely 
control the area of Khawr Maksar on the eastern side of greater 
Aden, and impose their control in the northern and southern 
parts of Khawr Maksar. These forces also controlled Aden airport. 
  The military reports originating in Aden added that the 
forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government also controlled the 
bridge that links the areas of al-Sha'b, al-Mansurah, and 
al-Shaykh 'Uthman in 'Adan al-Sughra with greater Aden, and 
reinforced their presence in the courtyard adjacent to Aden 
International Hotel in downtown Aden. 
  The reports went on to say that 250 separatists, along with 
their weapons, surrendered to the legitimacy forces after their 
fortified positions inside the city of Aden had fallen. 
  The separatists today acknowledged that the coastal Port of 
al-Mukalla, in which archseparatist 'Ali Salim al-Bid is holding 
out, had come under intense shelling. 
  Observers in Sanaa expect the al-Mukalla Port to have been 
neutralized by the artillery of the forces of the legitimate 
Yemeni Government to prevent the arrival of the supplies being 
shipped to the separatists via this port by some Gulf regimes. 
  The forces of the legitimate Yemeni Government seized 
control 
of 'Adan al-Sughra at midnight on Sunday [26 June].

<F P=106> [Report by Maher Chmaytelli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 28 (AFP) -- Northern troops aided 
by a blaze of artillery fire smashed through another defense 
line around Aden and were poised Tuesday [28 June] to capture 
the key southern city's water plant, an AFP correspondent 
reported. 
  Northern forces since late Monday were seen to have advanced 
five kilometers (three miles) south to the edge of Bi'r Nasir, 
the site of the water plant which southern officers said has 
already been destroyed. 
  The advance to Bi'r Nasir, 15 kilometers north of here, 
followed the north's entry Saturday into Aden's western suburbs 
where it gained control of the city's power station and cut the 
road to the oil refinery. 
  A southern officer told AFP that 1,000 shells were fired 
during the advance. 
  Hospital officials said that one civilian was killed and 18 
wounded overnight in shelling and rocketing of the northern 
suburbs and that three children died of dehydration. 
  The city has been totally without running water since Sunday 
after a few days of availability due to partial repairs to the 
water plant which was first hit at the start of the month. 
  Southern forces dug trenches and built sand barriers at the 
approaches to the city, withdrew artillery to the suburbs and 
the city center, and deployed Soviet-built surface-to-air 
missiles around the city. 
  Several rockets were fired at the city's television station 
but daily programing had not started and it was not clear if it 
had been damaged. 
  Aden Radio has been off the air since northern forces 
entered 
the western suburbs on Saturday and residents were glued to 
foreign stations. 
  The breakaway southern leadership meanwhile urged the 
international community to stop talking and come to Aden's 
rescue, implicitly criticizing the slowness of UN efforts to end 
the fighting in Yemen. 
  Five ceasefires have collapsed since the United Nations 
Security Council on June 1 adopted a resolution calling for an 
immediate truce and sending a special envoy on a 10-day mission 
earlier this month to set it up. 
  Each side accused the other of firing the first shot. 
  The United Nations was meanwhile considering another draft 
resolution. 
  "The civilized world is not reacting and is holding only 
consultations while the bloodthirsty Sanaa regime scorns UN 
resolutions, pursues its bombardment of Aden and its repression 
of the (south) Yemeni people," the leadership said. 
  In a statement carried by the official news media here, it 
said southerners were determined to "defend their land and their 
honor and to resist the occupation." 
  It issued an "appeal to the international community to stand 
by the people and save the city of Aden." 
  The statement denounced "Sanaa's determination to demolish 
the homes of Adenites and deprive them of water," accusing the 
northerners of taking as hostage women and children over six 
years old. 
  "Who would agree to union with such a regime," the 
leadership 
asked. 
  Southern Yemen declared a separate state on May 21 two weeks 
after war broke out between the former Marxist South Yemen and 
tribal North Yemen, which had formed a fragile four-year union. 
  Northern forces are led by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih 
and 
southern troops by his southern rival and former vice president 
'Ali Salim al-Bid.

<F P=106> [Report by Amir Taheri, Lutfi Shatarah, Khalil Matar, </F>
'Abd-al-Qawiyy al-Shami, and Naji al-Harazi: "French-Made Tank 
Appears in Attack on Aden"] 
  [Excerpt] London, New York, Aden, Sanaa, Rabat, AL-SHARQ 
AL-AWSAT -- Arab and international diplomatic endeavors were 
stepped up yesterday to secure a peace formula in Aden amid the 
escalating fighting in which the northern leadership in Sanaa is 
trying to storm Aden or seize the oil refinery or other vital 
installations there. 
  Eyewitnesses have said that three northern aircraft 
bombarded 
the oil refinery in Aden yesterday, causing damage to two 
pipelines. 
  In a significant development, southern military sources have 
stressed the northern forces' use of modern French-made tanks 
which were not among the Yemeni Army's armament after 
unification. 
  The sources pointed out that the tanks are part of the 
military aid provided recently to Sanaa by two Arab states with 
financing from a non-Arab Islamic state that has broadened and 
reinforced its relations with the Sanaa regime, especially since 
the Yemeni war broke out. 
  Northern forces intensified their bombardment of the 
positions near Aden airport, damaging part of Aden Hotel, the 
Badr Camp, and the al-Nasr Free Trade company. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- Competent Yemeni authorities 
have seized three MS-17 military cargo helicopters supplied by 
the rulers of Kuwait to the separatists in southern Yemen. 
Yemeni political sources told INA's correspondent in Sanaa that 
the three helicopters were brought under control recently upon 
landing at one of the airports in Shabwah Governorate, north of 
Aden. 
  The sources said the three helicopters were commanded by 
Yemeni pilots who had recently fled the control of the 
secessionists, along with their families, to seek refuge with 
the forces of legitimacy. 
  Diplomatic sources in Sanaa said the Kuwaiti helicopter deal 
is one of the arms supply deals between the Saudi and Kuwaiti 
regimes and the secessionists in Yemen.

  [Text] Aden, 28 Jun (KUNA) -- Northern forces this evening 
fired five rockets at the al-Mu'alla, al-Tawahi, and Khor Maksar 
areas of Aden. 
  A southern military source told KUNA that more than 20 
people 
were killed or wounded. 
  The source confirmed that the northern forces which have 
come 
close to Aden today are now launching artillery and rocket 
attacks on residential areas. 
  The battlefronts near the Aden refinery have witnessed 
fierce 
battles today and the KUNA correspondent, who was at the scene 
of the fighting, saw the southern forces advancing to the 
positions occupied by northern forces the day before yesterday. 
  The correspondent said that life is calm in Little Aden, 
where the southern forces have control over the oil refinery, 
and that the movement of traffic in the town to Aden is normal, 
contrary to news agency reports that northern forces had 
occupied the town of Little Aden. 
  A southern military communique said today that southern 
forces had destroyed 10 northern tanks which tried to approach 
the defense lines north of Aden. 
  The communique stressed that the town is "well fortified 
despite the continued shelling of residential areas."

  [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 29 (AFP) -- Attacking northern 
Yemeni warplanes set fire to the south's only oil refinery on 
Wednesday [29 June] as an air and artillery bombardment killed 
eight civilians and wounded 41 here, officials said. 
  A black cloud drifted over Aden from the burning refinery 18 
kilometers (11 miles) to the west. Journalists could not reach 
it because the road has been cut by fighting, but could see the 
fire from here. 
  A southern military spokesman said the refinery was attacked 
by two northern warplanes, while hospital officials said eight 
civilians were killed and 41 wounded in air raids and shelling 
of northern suburbs and other districts. 
  Buildings trembled from the pounding of artillery fire. 
  Oil storage tanks at the refinery were set ablaze three 
weeks 
ago after a northern raid, officials here said. 
  Northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have 
been trying to capture the refinery since they entered the 
western suburbs for the first time on Saturday, cutting off the 
road to the refinery. 
  Northern troops were also in control of Bir Nasr', 15 
kilometres (nine miles) from Aden, where the city's only water 
pumping station is sited. 
  Aden residents have suffered severe water and gasoline 
shortages since the north's advance into the city's suburbs.

<F P=106> [Speech by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih at an Arab </F>
Committee for the Defense of Yemeni Unity rally in Sanaa on 28 
June -- recorded] 
  [Text] Brother attendees: In your name and on behalf of 
our great Yemeni people, the people of September and October, we 
extend our greetings, thanks, and appreciation to the Arab 
Committee for the Defense of Yemeni Unity. 
  From this place, we extend our thanks and great appreciation 
for the Arab people everywhere, who are siding with our Yemeni 
people in this grave ordeal that erupted on 4 May, led by the 
traitor, agent and renegade 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  O dear brothers, O great Yemeni people, O sons of Saba' and 
Himyar: Just as you held your ground, defended and championed 
your will on 26 September and 14 October, you will champion the 
justice and dignity of 22 May 1990. [applause] 
  O brothers and sisters, O sons of our Yemeni people 
everywhere: In your name, we extend our great appreciation to 
the masses of our Arab nation everywhere in the east and the 
Maghreb of the Arab nation, the Gulf, and the Horn of Africa, 
who are siding with you in defense of your unity. 
  You are not only fighting the separatist clique on the 
battlefield. You know who has conspired against your Yemeni 
unity. [applause] 
  We are fighting this clique, which we can describe as 
traitorous. Today, they are loitering at the hotel doors to 
express their loyalty to the regimes that pay them filthy money 
and to receive the price of unity and the price of the pure 
blood being shed. They are rushing to the doors of hotels, 
offices, and embassies abroad. History will not forgive these 
agent, renegade traitors. They will not be heroes in making 
unity or heroes in achieving victory. History records only the 
names of people who make great achievements. [applause] 
  Successive resolutions are being issued by the Security 
Council. In addition, some regimes and brothers in the Arab 
world, as well as some friends are shedding crocodile tears over 
Yemeni blood. We tell them from this place, the Hall of Jamal 
'Abd-al-Nasir, the great Arab leader [applause]: Do not shed 
crocodile tears, but stop harming our people. [applause] Stop 
harming our people and interfering in the internal affairs of 
the homeland of September and October. The pure blood being 
shed today is shed to entrench Yemeni unity. [applause] 
  We greet each woman who gave birth to a struggler to defend 
Yemeni unity. Our people today are rushing to embrace (?death) 
and are acting out of an absolutely free will to defend unity. 
The blood being shed today in Dar Sa'd, al-Shaykh 'Uthman, 
al-Mansurah, the city of al-Sha'b, and (?Mandar) in Aden, will 
not be for secession or to install the secessionist in Aden as 
rulers. This pure blood is being shed to preserve unity and 
destroy this separatist, rebellious clique. 
  No matter what successive resolutions are issued, we will 
never accept the implementation of a secessionist resolution. 
[applause] No matter what successive resolutions are issued -- 
to install the traitor al-Bid; the treasonous al-Jifri; 
al-'Attas, who is loitering at the doors of intelligence 
services; and the third traitor who is sentenced to death, 
al-Asnaj -- we will never ever accept their installation under 
any circumstances. 
  Dear brothers, we welcome the Security Council resolutions 
that call for a cease-fire. We have said time and time again 
that we are willing to cooperate with Security Council 
resolutions to effect a cease-fire and start dialogue with the 
oppressed elements for the sake of unity and democracy in Yemen. 
[applause] 
  We are willing to respond to, and cooperate with, these 
resolutions that call for a cease-fire, in spite of the 
strenuous efforts and hardship that some brothers have had to 
endure to quickly bring about such resolutions. We highly 
appreciate their interest in Yemen. We had hoped that the 
greatest service they would do to Yemen would be to stop harming 
Yemen. [applause] 
  Dear brothers and sisters: We invite the local, party and 
foreign press in our country to head for the battlefield to 
ascertain that the cease-fire, which we announced six times, has 
been violated and that the traitors, secessionists, outlaws who 
departed from legitimacy do not want a cease-fire. We knew 
beforehand what they seek to achieve by violating the 
cease-fire. They seek to bring in international troops to 
observe the situation in Yemen. The [UN] Charter and 
[international] law do not allow any observation or 
international troops without the approval of all parties. So no 
matter how quickly these resolutions are issued, there must be 
an approval by the parties in the Yemeni Republic. We are the 
major party, the Yemeni people, in the face of the rebels. It is 
not the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, 
the Arab Ba'th Party, the Nasirist Party, or any other party in 
the Yemeni homeland, but it is the people, who are one party in 
the face of the forces of apostasy and secession. 
  Once again, we call on our brothers, beloved ones, and 
neighbors to stop harming us, to stop harming the Yemeni people. 
They must be certain that, just as we remained steadfast in the 
fighting and confrontation, with our limited potentials, in 
defense of the Yemeni revolution from 26 September 1962 until 
1970, we are also ready once again to defend the Yemeni Republic 
that was declared on 22 May 1990. [applause] 
  We do not fight on the front as an army, as parties, or 
organizations. The Yemeni people are spontaneously and freely 
moving to the front to defend unity. 
  Some are shedding crocodile tears over brave Aden, the 
second 
capital, fearing it will be destroyed or hit by the machine guns 
or the artillery shells of the forces of legitimacy. All these 
bullets and shells are fired by those who deviated from 
legitimacy. You know about the biased media covering this and 
distorting the facts. When the Republican Hospital area in Sanaa 
was hit by Scud missiles, the biased media said this destroyed 
area and the dead women and children were located in Aden. Such 
is the fairness of the friendly media of those who are concerned 
about the bloodshed in Yemen. The biased media want to fragment 
the Yemeni homeland. We say to them, from this place, that 
Yemen will not be fragmented, will not become two Yemens, and 
will not become four or even five Yemens. Yemen will remain one 
and united. [applause] 
  They should know that the 2 billion dollars they spent 
during 
the crisis will not bring them success. The military and 
political infrastructure [of the southerners] was completely 
destroyed in five weeks, thanks to the will of the Yemeni 
people. They want to destroy Yemen unity. Are they ready to 
pay another 2 billion? They should spend another 2 billion for 
construction, for sisterly Sudan, for Somalia, and for all the 
Arab homeland. They should leave Yemen alone. Yemen will 
continue to exist on the political and geographical map. 
[applause] 
  No force in the world can change the Yemeni people, remove 
them from the political map of the southern Arabian Peninsula, 
or move them to any other place. The Yemeni people will 
continue to exist on the political and geographical map. 
  If some regimes are hostile to President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is one Yemeni citizen. Why are they 
making the Yemeni people pay the price? I did not come to Yemen, 
to the homeland, on the political decision of another country. 
I am a citizen of this land. [applause] 
  Why do we not respect people's freedom? Why do they lack 
respect for our will, as we respect them and respect 
neighborliness? Why do they not stop harming us and stop 
interfering in our internal affairs? The Yemeni people have not 
interfered in others' affairs. 
  Dear brothers: In your name, I greet your sons and beloved 
ones in the axes of military operations, asking God to grant 
them splendid victory. In your name, we thank the brothers and 
friends for their sincere support of Yemeni unity. 
  We hope the other friends will not change their stands, that 
they will maintain their stands as they were at the beginning. 
Some announced, at the beginning of the crisis, that they 
support unity and democracy. However, at the end of the war, 
they began to say something else. They began to speak about 
stopping bloodshed. We said: Have you received the price? We 
hope positions will not change. [applause] 
  We extend the hand of cooperation to all those who respect 
our will, principles, values, ideals, and faith. We extend the 
hand of cooperation to all those who respect the will of this 
nation. Those who think that Yemenis will bow down must realize 
that we bow only to God almighty. [applause] The Yemeni people 
will never bow to any force in the world. We fight for our 
dignity, for our existence, for our sovereignty, for our belief, 
and for living peacefully on our Yemeni land. 
  Our unity will not (?pose) any danger to any other country. 
It is the unity of the Yemeni people and a unity for the Arab 
nation, for the good and unionist Arabs. 
  Dear brothers: God willing, when the war stops the future 
will shine, based on national, modern scientific bases, on all 
political, social, cultural, and administrative levels. We will 
expand local government power in all Yemeni governorates. The 
sons of the governorates will elect their administrative leaders 
in their areas. [applause] Local governments will have full 
control over all their affairs, except for the sovereign 
resources of the Republic of Yemen. Citizens will elect their 
local councils, governors, and commissioners throughout Yemen. 
[applause] 
  Dear brothers: We are passing through a crisis and a war. 
However, the war did not start on 4 May and the crisis did not 
start on 2 August. The crisis began when the secessionists took 
their government posts after 22 May 1990. Since then, the 
Yemeni people have been living a real crisis. The unity 
festival lasted only six months. After contacting their 
brothers and friends, who are known for their love and respect 
for Yemen, the crisis began and the Yemeni people began to 
suffer from this crisis. 
  Our greetings to you all and to the Arab Committee for the 
Defense of Yemeni Unity. Greetings to all professors, to all 
thinkers, and to all authors. Greetings to all of you in the 
name of our Yemeni people, wishing you success and victory. 
  God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you.

<F P=106> [Report on interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim by </F>
Claude Lorieux at the Yemeni Embassy in Paris; date not given: 
"`Aden Would Capitulate Without Foreign Aid'" -- all place 
names as published] 
  [Text] "The Aden rebels would not last a day if they 
stopped using innocent people as human shields and if foreign 
aid in the form of arms and money dried up," Foreign Minister 
Muhammad Salim Basindwah of the Republic of Yemen (capital: 
Sanaa) told LE FIGARO. 
  On a visit to Paris, where he was supposed to meet with 
Foreign Minister Alain Juppe yesterday, the Yemeni foreign 
minister made the following accusation: "The rebels are kept 
alive like a dying man on a life support system. The aid 
arrives in large quantities from Ukraine and other eastern 
European countries. The arms come from the black market. The 
Aden separatists do not buy them directly. Other people do it 
for them. I will not say who. I do not want to fall out with 
my neighbors. After flying over the province of al-Mahrah 
(which borders Oman and Saudi Arabia), the airplanes unload 
their hardware in Rayyan, near Mukalla (the eastern province of 
Hadramaout). Boats transport the arms and ammunition to Aden." 
  Although he has spent "half his life in South Yemen and the 
other half in North Yemen," Mr. Basindwah says he is "more 
attached to North Yemen," where he was often a minister before 
1990, the year of unification. Loyal to the unitary line of 
President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the minister gets irritated when 
mention is made of the establishment of a "democratic Yemen" 
(capital: Aden). "I would prefer," he said, "to dig my grave 
with my own hands." 
  He jumps up when asked if the embassy in Paris, where he met 
with LE FIGARO, is the embassy of North Yemen or South Yemen, 
which are once again separated: "It is the embassy of the 
Republic of Yemen. There is only one state in Yemen, the other 
one (the Aden one) is illegal, and no capital has recognized it. 
Yemen was unified by referendum and elected a government in 
1993." 
  The minister, who visited London, the Hague, Bonn, and 
Copenhagen, and who is leaving Paris today for Moscow, stressed 
that the ministers with whom he met were generally "in favor of 
unity and democracy in Yemen." 
  Could one of the causes of the south's insurrection be the 
muscular conception which (northern) President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih has of democracy? "President Salih's party won the 
elections held in April 1993," retorted Mr. Basindwah. 
"Nevertheless, we insisted that the country be run by a 
coalition government. We chose this formula so that the country 
could get used to democracy. We need time. Do not forget that 
we live in a region where democracy is not liked." 
  No matter how much the envoy from Sanaa emphasizes that the 
current crisis "is not a fight between North and South, but 
between the majority of Yemenis and the renegades," the 
survivors will have a lot of trouble picking up the pieces of 
the shattered unity. The authorities have solutions to propose: 
"Each government (province) could benefit from very broad 
autonomy, while naturally ruling out functions such as defense 
and diplomacy." 
<H5>  `KGB and Stasi' </H5>
  This kind of development would apply both to the 12 
governorships of the North and the six governorships of the 
South. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is in effect rejecting 
any compromise which would give the South different treatment 
than the North. This means there is no question of a 
federation. "This kind of solution can be applied to different 
peoples in a single state, but not to Yemenis. We are a single 
people in terms of race, religion, and language," Mr. Basindwah 
stressed. 
  The conciliatory -- to say the least -- attitude of the 
monarchies in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) toward the 
separatist regime in Aden clearly embarrasses Sanaa, which was 
formerly the capital of a conservative North Yemen pampered by 
Saudi Arabia. The minister explained his discretion in this 
matter: "My role is to heal the wounds, not make them worse." 
He did acknowledge, however, that "some of our neighbors would 
like Yemen to explode. They do not want a strong, unified 
Yemen." This is an example of a "short-term vision, because a 
strong, unified Yemen would bring greater peace and stability to 
the region." 
  "The oil wealth of the southern part of Yemen could be one 
reason for the crisis," the Sanaa foreign minister felt. "I 
think that certain leaders in the Yemeni Socialist Party 
(comprised primarily of southerners) were unable to resist the 
temptations, and that they received money from everywhere. It 
must not be forgotten that some were paid by the KBG and the 
Stasi." 
  Weakening -- not to mention crushing -- the South is likely 
to strengthen conservatism in the North, which is more tribal 
and more religious. Mr. Basindwah admits that "the existence 
of the Yemeni Socialist Party helped to maintain a balance 
between secular and traditionalist groups," before adding that 
"Muslim fundamentalism has not gained a lot of ground among the 
Yemeni people."

  [Text] [Amir] Dr. Sha'th? 
  [Sha'th] Yes. 
  [Amir] You are full of surprises [Sha'th heard laughing]. 
You are always surprising me, always. I understand that you 
just spoke with.... 
  [Sha'th, interrupting] I told everybody he [PLO leader Yasir 
'Arafat] is coming at the end of the month and then I gave up, 
but he is doing it. 
  [Amir] So, I understand that you have just spoke with 
Chairman 'Arafat. 
  [Sha'th] That's right. 
  [Amir] And, what is the message? 
  [Sha'th] He is coming Friday [1 July]. 
  [Amir] Directly to Gaza? 
  [Sha'th] Well, through Rafah. 
  [Amir] And, to stay how long? 
  [Sha'th] Well, maybe three or four days, and before he goes 
to Paris. 
  [Amir] So, he will visit Jericho or not? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, probably, most likely. 
  [Amir] So, it is the big day. 
  [Sha'th] Right. 
  [Amir] Are you coming with him Friday? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, yes. 
  [Amir] So you are going to attend the Romeo and Juliet play? 
  [Sha'th] No, I'm not. 
  [Amir] You will be with him? 
  [Sha'th] Yes, but I had apologized earlier because he was 
coming to Egypt and I was to meet President Mubarak with him 
tomorrow. So, I had apologized to Mrs. Aloni anyway. 
  [Amir] Sir, can you specify some details of the visit of 
Chairman 'Arafat? 
  [Sha'th] Well, nothing more than that. He's coming on 
Friday through Egypt, via Rafah. He is going to stay in Gaza 
most of the time. He will go to Jericho and come back to Gaza, 
and then he will leave out of Gaza to Egypt again. 
  [Amir] And then to Paris? 
  [Sha'th] Right. 
  [Amir] Thank you very much, sir. 
  [Sha'th] You are welcome.

<F P=106> [Report by Sophia 'Amarah from Gaza] </F>
  [Text] A meeting was held at the Eretz checkpoint today 
between Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of the Palestinian negotiating 
team, and Major General Dani Rothschild, his new Israeli 
counterpart. 
  Monte Carlo radio interviewed the member of the Palestinian 
National Authority [PNA] immediately after the meeting. 
  [Begin recording] ['Amarah] Dr. Sha'th: What topics were 
discussed during the meeting? 
  [Sha'th] We discussed all outstanding issues. Moreover, we 
planned for future talks. I can say that today's meeting marked 
a real beginning for the second phase. It was also in 
preparation for the meeting between President 'Arafat on the one 
hand, and Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres on the 
other, due to be held in Paris on 7 July. It was an important 
meeting for the overall peace process. We discussed the issue 
of detainees and prisoners. I have informed Maj. Gen. 
Rothschild that we have chosen Hisham 'Abd-al-Raziq, a freed 
prisoner, to be the chairman of the Palestinian committee 
assigned the task of holding negotiations on Palestinian 
detainees and prisoners. All members of this committee will be 
freed detainees and prisoners. Additionally, we agreed on a 
good first step for the negotiating process. Nonetheless, I 
cannot divulge details. This is because I will go to President 
'Arafat first to seek his approval of this prelude before it is 
announced. 
  ['Amarah] Has a date been set for the resumption of talks? 
  [Sha'th] This is also contingent upon the venue and time, 
which have to be decided by President 'Arafat first. 
  ['Amarah] Israeli Minister of Environmental Protection Yosi 
Sarid, who took part in the meeting, has said that he attended 
the meeting to find out how the agreement will be implemented on 
the ground, and also to find out about the problems facing the 
agreement. He expressed his belief that there must be a rapid 
transfer of powers to the PNA in the occupied West Bank, with 
the exception of settlements, Jerusalem, and safe roads, as he 
put it. [end recording]

<F P=106> [Report by Hasan Abu-Zayid from Gaza Eretz checkpoint; from </F>
the "With the Midday Events" program] 
  [Text] The meeting Dr. Nabil Sha'th held with Major General 
Dani Rothschild, coordinator of the Defense Ministry activities 
in the territories, ended a short while ago. This meeting paves 
the way for the resumption of talks between the Israeli and 
Palestinian delegations on the implementation of self-rule in 
the rest of the West Bank. The most important topics discussed 
by the two were the release of Palestinian prisoners, the border 
crossing points, and the presence of Palestinian police at them. 
Dr. Nabil Sha'th spoke to us a short while ago: 
  [Begin Sha'th recording] I believe such meetings are very 
useful to declare and actually draw up plans for the next phase 
of negotiations on Palestinian authority in the West Bank. This 
required a comprehensive assessment of what was implemented thus 
far. This basically included the problem of prisoners and those 
released -- a problem which is of concern to every Palestinian 
citizen. We also discussed the problem of the implementation of 
security, secure passage, border posts, international presence, 
and a quadruple committee meeting to discuss the problem of 
refugees. All these issues were discussed, in addition to an 
assessment of the economic situation, Palestinian labor force in 
Israel, and the easing of restrictions on Gaza and other 
Palestinian areas. We made a comprehensive assessment. Some 
solutions and the role of the security coordination committee 
and the civil coordination committee in solving these problems 
were discussed. 
  Regarding the negotiations, I cannot talk about any details 
because we have actually agreed to several points. We have to 
refer to President 'Arafat before any of them can be publicized. 
We have also agreed to prepare for President 'Arafat's meeting 
with Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in 
Paris on 7 July. Consequently, the beginning of negotiations 
and formation of committees and the Palestinian-Israeli summit 
were the subject of our planning. I will be satisfied with this 
because I cannot answer questions on the venue, time, and 
details because these all first require the approval of 
President 'Arafat. Naturally, General Rothschild will also 
consult with his leadership for the same reason. I think the 
meeting was positive and I hope it will herald the start of a 
new stage in the peace process. [end recording] 
  Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild said after the meeting that the 
Israeli and Palestinian sides will prepare for a meeting between 
Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres 
on the one hand, and PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat on 7 July on the 
other. The start of negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians on the implementation of self-rule in the rest of 
the West Bank will then be announced.

  [Excerpt] Negotiations on autonomy issues not yet 
concluded, such as elections for the Palestinian council, got 
under way this morning at the Eretz checkpoint in the Gaza 
Strip. This is the first time the sides have met for formal 
talks since the introduction of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. 
Jack Katzenell reports: 
  [Begin recording] [Katzenell] The talks ended a short while 
ago. Major General Rothschild came out, and he said there would 
be another meeting next week. He said he had not engaged in 
negotiations proper, merely preparations, discussions of a wide 
range of subjects, problems that had cropped up, and things that 
had to be discussed. 
  I asked him if there was any truth in the report that Prime 
Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was unwilling to proceed to the next 
stage of the autonomy until the Palestinians had proven 
themselves in the area of civilian administration. 
  [Rothschild] Well, the fact that I am here, dealing with Dr. 
Nabil Sha'th on issues of the continuation of the peace process, 
shows you that Israel will do whatever is needed as far as the 
DOP [Declaration of Principles] is concerned. 
  [Katzenell] When the group convened this morning, Minister 
of the Environment Yosi Sarid was also present. His meeting 
with Nabil Sha'th was more like a reunion of old friends. When 
Sarid came out, he was asked by a reporter when Nabil Sha'th 
would be visiting Jerusalem: 
  [Sarid] There is no problem. Jerusalem is a free city, open 
city, and the only problem is to coordinate Dr. Nabil Sha'th's 
visit in Jerusalem. The problem is in coordination. [passage 
omitted] [end recording] 
  [A related report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 
1000 
GMT on 28 June adds: "Dr. Nabil Sha'th says he advised Yasir 
'Arafat to postpone his arrival in the autonomy territories 
because having visited Jericho himself, he realized that the 
local security arrangements are inadequate." 
  [The report adds that Gen. Rothschild said "that in his 
meeting with Sha'th, a decision was made to expedite the 
resumption of the negotiations on the transfer of civilian 
powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinians."] 
  [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 28 June 
carries a report on an interview with Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq 
by Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, adding that 
"Baraq said that the implementation of the agreement in Gaza is 
making good progress." "In response to a question on whether 
Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq has ended his role as head of the Israeli 
delegation, Baraq said: Do not worry. Gen. Shahaq was not, is 
not, and will not be removed from this activity. Who will 
conduct the talks in Judaea and Samaria? we asked. The 
composition of the delegation and the way it will be managed 
will be determined by the government, along with the details as 
to what will be discussed and when. Gen. Shahaq completed an 
important circle in the signing of the agreement, and he will 
continue to follow and coordinate the activities of the various 
IDF branches vis-a-vis the Palestinians. On the practical, 
civilian level, contacts will be managed by Maj. Gen. Dani 
Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the 
territories. On issues regarding the security committee, in 
which the Planning Branch takes part, the talks will be managed 
by Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan."]

<F P=106> [Report by Rashid Khashanah: "Fatah Central Committee Urges </F>
'Arafat To Move to Jericho"] 
  [Text] Tunis -- An informed Palestinian source has told 
AL-HAYAH that members of Fatah's Central Committee tried hard to 
persuade President Yasir 'Arafat to move to the autonomy areas. 
These attempts were made during the Central Committee meeting in 
Tunis last Saturday [18 June]. The meeting was devoted to 
discussion of completion of the arrangements for transporting 
some of Fatah's cadres to the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area. 
  The source said that 'Arafat did not give a specific answer 
to the members' request but they understood that he linked his 
decision to the results of the visit of Ahmad Quray' 
(Abu-'Ala'), head of the PLO's Economic Department and economy 
minister in the Palestinian Authority, to the United States and 
his talks with World Bank officials on the aid the bank intends 
to give the Palestinian Authority. 
  A Fatah Central Committee member said that 'Arafat would 
probably move to Jericho around the middle of next month after 
his visit to Paris on 6 July to receive the Houphouet-Boigny 
peace prize along with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 
Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, and after a clear and accurate 
picture emerges about the financial situation of the Palestinian 
Authority in the light of the meeting of the donor states in the 
second week of July.

  [Text] Tunis, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Palestinian President Yasir 
'Arafat has issued a decree forming a committee chaired by Yahya 
Khalaf, head of the PLO's Cultural Department, to travel to the 
Palestinian autonomy region to learn about the situation there 
at first hand and prepare a report to be presented to the 
Palestinian leadership. 
  Yahya Khalaf stated that the Palestinian leadership will 
study this report in light of which it will make its final 
decision on who should return to Gaza and Jericho immediately 
and who should wait until special arrangements to return are 
made. 
  He said the committee, which includes Jamil Shihadah, 
secretary general of the Palestinian Teachers Union, and Rawhi 
Futuhi, secretary of the Palestinian popular organizations, will 
travel to Amman later today en route to Jericho and then the

  [Text] Tunis, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Informed Palestinian 
sources said that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is currently 
studying a proposal to form a Palestinian human rights committee 
that is independent of the Palestinian Authority and is not 
affected by internal or external factors. 
  These sources said that an internal committee has been 
formed, comprising of the following members: Salwa Abu-Khadr, 
secretary general of the Palestinian Women's Union; Nabil 
Ramlawi, PLO ambassador to Switzerland; Yahya Yakhluf, director 
general of the PLO Cultural Department; Jamil Shihadah, 
secretary general of the Palestinian Teachers' Union; Father 
Ibrahim 'Ayyad, member of the Palestine National Council; and 
Mrs. Jamilah Saydam, alias Umm Sabri, official responsible for 
external relations in the Women's Union. 
  The sources pointed out that the duty of this committee will 
be to propose a list of the persons who will then make up the 
Palestinian human rights committee. 
  Informed Palestinian sources feel that 'Arafat's intention 
to 
form this committee is to confront the committee formed by Dr. 
Hanan 'Ashrawi, the official spokeswoman for the previous 
negotiating Palestinian delegations. She rejected her 
appointment by 'Arafat to the Palestinian National Authority and 
declared that she will continue her activities through the 
committee she has formed to defend Palestinian human rights in 
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, member of the </F>
Palestinian delegation to the talks with donor countries and the 
World Bank in Washington, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date 
not given -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, have you managed to 
convince U.S. and World Bank officials to disburse the aid to 
cover the Palestinian budget deficit? 
  ['Abdallah] I believe the discussions over the past days 
have 
made substantial progress in the effort to raise funds and turn 
pledges into payments so that the Palestinian authority will be 
able to function normally. 
  [Mu'addi] Has an agreement been reached on the mechanism of 
disbursing aid for the self-rule administration? 
  ['Abdallah] The mechanisms were already agreed on. There is 
the mechanism of direct payment for the PLO and the mechanism of 
payment through the Johan Holst peace fund. 
  [Mu'addi] What are the demands or reservations that U.S. and 
World Bank officials made regarding the disbursement of 
financial aid for the Palestinians? 
  ['Abdallah] There is nothing new in this regard. The 
Palestinian side has been criticized for the delay in activating 
financial and tax collecting offices. 
  [Mu'addi] Then what are the obstacles hampering the 
immediate 
disbursement of aid to the Palestinians? 
  ['Abdallah] Aid disbursement has already started. I do not 
believe that there will be a problem. The problem is that the 
aid is still less than the needs. Up to this moment, a major 
portion of the deficit in the Palestinian budget is still 
uncovered. The other side of the problem is that the payments 
must be made on time so that the Palestinian authority will not 
face a liquidity problem. 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah, does the date of Yasir 
'Arafat's arrival depend on the disbursement of financial aid 
for the Palestinians? 
  ['Abdallah] In fact, I have no accurate information about 
this issue. However, it is known that for the Palestinian 
authority to be able to perform its duties, the required funds 
must be made available and paid on time. This problem is being 
resolved. The next few weeks will witness activities that will 
resolve this problem? 
  [Mu'addi] Dr. Samir 'Abdallah in Washington, thank you very 
much. 
  ['Abdallah] Not at all.

  [Text] Gaza, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Hasan 'Usfur, official in 
charge of directing negotiations in the Palestinian National 
Authority [PNA], has accused Israel of trying to implement the 
Cairo agreement signed by the two sides on 4 May in a way that 
is not compatible with its spirit and of trying to put obstacles 
before the PNA. 
  In an exclusive statement to MENA, 'Usfur, who is a member 
of 
the Palestinian delegation now negotiating in the 
Palestinian-Israeli security committee, said that Israel is 
trying to exploit the security aspect in order to stop or impede 
the Palestinians' movement on the pretext of "security issues." 
  He added: We regard these practices by the Israeli side as 
an attempt to depict the PNA as impotent and incapable of being 
a strong authority and therefore inciting the Palestinians 
against the PNA. 
  He noted that the Israeli side's objective is to put the 
Palestinian side in a weak position when future negotiations 
start between the two sides. 
  'Usfur also accused the Israeli side of blatantly violating 
the Cairo agreement on a number of security matters. He said 
the Israeli side sometimes stops the Palestinians from moving 
around in the areas under its control or in the areas where they 
have security privileges. He added that the Israeli side is 
doing this in a way that completely violates the agreement. He 
added that the Israeli side also carries out actions that annoy 
the Palestinian citizens in the Jericho area, such as 
complicating traffic along the Jericho-al'Awjah road, which 
belongs to the self-rule authority, the Palestinians' travel 
from the West Bank to Jericho and vice versa, and not yet 
completing the security passageway between the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 
  He noted that Israel has come up with a concept that 
contradicts the agreement. He said that the Palestinian side 
was surprised by this behavior because it realizes that it is 
waging a new battle to build the Palestinian Authority under the 
shadow of political complications and the complications of the 
agreement itself. 
  Hasan 'Usfur said: We believe that building the National 
Authority is an historic challenge for the Palestinian people 
and we fully realize that Israel will not be a peaceful state 
that will give the Palestinians the opportunity to build its own 
developed and civilized entity. 
  He expressed his belief that there are mentalities inside 
Israel that believe that Israel is the only advanced country in 
the region and the only country that has the proper human 
conditions and therefore it tries to put obstacles before the 
future evolvement of the Palestinian entity. 
  Regarding the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners 
and detainees, 'Usfur said that the Israeli side was not sincere 
when it came to implementing the recorded or unrecorded 
agreements between the two sides. He added: Discussion of this 
issue began with the Oslo negotiations and there were more than 
one Israeli promise to solve it. It was also discussed during 
the Taba and Cairo negotiations. The Israelis tried to restrict 
the release of some detainees. We understood some of these 
restrictions but they, regrettably, used this understanding to 
complicate the release of the detainees. 
  Hasan 'Usfur said that the Israeli side has interpreted some 
aspects of the Cairo agreement as it pleases. It is exploiting 
the fact that the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] needs to 
have the Palestinian prisoners released and the difficult 
conditions the prisoners live under in prison. 
  He clarified that as a result of this, Israel began to set 
new conditions on the prisoner-release process. Some of these 
conditions are the pledges the prisoners sign before their 
release, and the place they are taken to after they are 
released. None of these conditions were stipulated in the 
agreement. 
  'Usfur noted that currently there are attempts to restore 
dialogue and negotiate over this issue. 
  He said that the arrival of Palestinian president Yasir 
'Arafat to the PNA area is encountering some difficulties as a 
result of the complications Israel is creating, particularly 
since they are complications of a political nature. 
  In his interview with MENA, Hasan 'Usfur said that the 
Palestinian side believes the Cairo agreement is the first stage 
to finding a final solution. We were hoping that this stage 
would mark the beginning of the end of a long era between the 
Palestinian and Israeli sides. 
  He said that upon assuming authority in the self-rule areas 
in Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian side worked on providing 
the necessary conditions to keep the commitments that were 
stipulated in the recent Cairo agreement. 
  He expressed his belief that important progress was made in 
a 
record time period, especially in the security field. The 
Palestinian side succeeded in asserting the prestige of the 
Palestinian security authority. This closed the door before all 
wagers that the PNA will not be able to succeed easily, since 
there will be strong opposition to the agreement. 
  He said that there were some people who believed that a 
civil 
war will erupt. But what has happened is the exact opposite. 
The PNA was given a very warm welcome and the people responded 
positively to it. Everyone realized that there is only one law: 
the law of the Palestinian Authority.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Source Close to Abu-Mazin Denies He </F>
Intends To Resign From Fatah"] 
  [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- While it has been 
confirmed that Muhammad Ghunaym (Abu-Mahir) has submitted his 
resignation from the Mobilization and Organization Department in 
Fatah and from his other political and movement duties, Fatah 
sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that Mahmud 'Abbas 
(Abu-Mazin) is in severe disagreement with Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat because of his hesitation over returning to Gaza 
and Jericho and offering guarantees to the World Bank and the 
donor states to facilitate the provision of grants and aid -- 
which prompted some people to talk about the possibility of 
Abu-Mazin's resigning his posts. But an authoritative source in 
the office of Abu-Mazin, head of the PLO Pan-Arab and 
International Relations, has stressed to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 
"there is no truth in recent reports of Abu-Mazin's intention to 
quit political and organization action or to resign from Fatah." 
  The source added that Abu-Mazin's explaining the reasons 
that 
prompted Abu-Mahir to resign and to quit political and movement 
action does not mean "a similarity in their positions." The 
source vehemently denied that there is any coordination between 
Abu-Mahir and Abu-Mazin with regard to the resignation issue. 
  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that Abu-Mazin and Faruq 
Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) [head of the PLO Political Department] 
succeeded the day before yesterday in persuading Abu-Mahir to 
abandon his seclusion and resume his daily work in his office. 
Cadres from the Mobilization and Organization Department have 
contacted Abu-Mahir at his home, urging him to abandon his 
resignation "because he is needed in order not to perpetuate 
autocracy in the movement." 
  Elsewhere, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a 
misunderstanding arose yesterday between 'Arafat and Abu-al-Lutf 
in front of European Union ambassadors over the current balance 
of the Scandinavian states' aid fund for the Palestinian people 
-- the fund named after the late Norwegian Foreign Minister 
(Jorgen) Holst. Reports say that 'Arafat put the figure at $53 
million, while Abu-al-Lutf put it at $60 million. This conflict 
in the figures aroused the European ambassadors' suspicions 
about the fate of the $7 million, the difference between the two 
figures.

  [Text] Nabulus -- The Arab Liberation Front [ALF], a PLO 
faction, has reaffirmed its lack of commitment to the 
Gaza-Jericho accord and all that it construes despite the fact 
that the ALF has remained within the PLO's framework. The ALF 
stated that it will not follow a specific policy nor abandon any 
form of "struggle" while maintaining its freedom to determine 
its policy according to the requirements that fulfill the 
Palestinian people's hopes and aspirations. 
  A statement issued by the ALF -- led by Abu-al-'Abbas -- and 
distributed in Nabulus said that the ALF will deal with any 
institution that will be established through the new political 
reality if it becomes clear that this institution serves the 
interest of Palestinian society and is committed to the 
Palestinian people's causes, be that the Palestinian police 
force or other institutions whose positive role in improving the 
social situation becomes evident.

  [Text] Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- A Palestinian party 
participating in the Palestinian self-rule authority council has 
criticized PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's 
delay in coming to the self-rule areas in the Gaza Strip and 
Jericho. 
  A statement by the Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, said 
that this delay, whatever its justification or reason, causes 
harmful effects on the unity of the Palestinian leadership's 
performance in various spheres and on the clarity of the plan of 
action. It also paralyzes the capacity of members of the 
national authority in carrying out their responsibilities as a 
collective team. 
  The party hinted at withdrawing from the authority and 
pointed out that "its support for and continued participation in 
the authority depends on the its possession of a comprehensive 
national plan to pursue the battle of independence; on the 
realization of adequate participation, justice, and equality; 
and on the granting of freedom." The statement also called for 
accelerating the completion of the authority's domain. 
  The party is currently represented in the authority council 
by its secretary general, Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, who holds the 
education and arts portfolio, and Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, who 
holds the youth and sport portfolio.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Amid Instructions To Dismiss </F>
`al-Duris' Group, Iraqi Ba'th Party Fills Its Leading Vacancies 
Through Internal Elections, Excluding `Malcontents'"] 
  [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Iraqi President Saddam 
Husayn has ordered the ruling Ba'th Party's apparatus in Baghdad 
to conduct internal elections with a view to filling the party's 
leading vacancies resulting from last year's large-scale 
dismissals. 
  The elections have begun at the lower levels and will reach 
their peak in four weeks when the Ba'th Party holds an 
extraordinary conference to choose new leadership members, 
including four candidates to fill vacancies resulting from the 
dismissal from the regional command of Nuri Faysal Shahir, Fawzi 
Khalaf Zurayq, 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri, and Khadr al-Duri. 
  Well-informed Iraqi sources have said that the instructions 
issued to the party's organization stipulate that 160 leading 
members in various cities -- most of them from Mosul, al-Dur, 
and the al-Jubur tribe -- are not to be elected, under a 
large-scale plan to purge the party apparatus of the malcontents 
about whom the security services linked directly to the Iraqi 
president have reservations. 
  The sources pointed to a prevalent tendency to dismiss more 
elements from the "al-Duris" group in preparation for handing 
over the party leadership to a number of the Iraqi president's 
relatives, including his brother, Interior Minister Watban 
Ibrahim, and son, 'Udayy. 
  The last extraordinary conference the Ba'th party held was 
after the Gulf war. A number of party leaders were dismissed at 
that conference, among them former Prime Minister Sa'dun Hammadi. 
  Meanwhile the association for the defense of freedoms in 
Iraq 
has announced that Iraqi writer Jasim al-Rasif, head of the 
writers union in Mosul, has been arrested by the special 
security service and that his fate has been unknown since the 
beginning of the month. 
  The association said in a leaflet distributed from its 
office 
in Ankara that two journalists, namely Lutfi al-Khayyat and 
Ahmad Sabri, have been prevented from assuming their 
journalistic work since their release. They were detained for 
more than a month in the jails of the the Olympic Committee, of 
which the Iraqi president's son, 'Udayy, is in charge. 
  The association has repeated its demand for the release of 
35 
writers and journalists who have been detained since the Iraqi 
president's son assumed the chairmanship of the literary, 
journalistic, and cultural organizations in Iraq.

  [Text] In an interview with the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY, 
Hizballah Deputy Secretary General Shaykh Na'im Qasim answered a 
question on prisoner exchange with the Israelis. He said that 
in the past an international organization, the United Nations, 
intervened and sent a personal envoy--Gian Domenico Pico--to 
discuss the issue of POW's between the Lebanese and Israelis. 
He added: This effort stopped long ago and we consider that 
any neutral party acceptable to us, be it regional or 
international, is suitable to discuss the release of POW's held 
in Israel. 
  Qasim went on: We have said it before; we hold two prisoners 
and are ready to swap them with prisoners and detainees held in 
Israeli and South Lebanese Army jails but Israel is blocking 
this move. He noted that Mustafa al-Dirani's abduction has 
achieved nothing for Israel as regards airman Ron Arad. 
  Answering a question on Hizballah's view of the two 
indictments against [leader of the dissolved Lebanese Forces 
Party] Samir Ja'ja', he said: The measure was good and we call 
for strengthening the domestic arena to rally all resources in 
the face of Israel. 
  Assessing Hizballah's experiment in the Chamber of Deputies, 
he said parliament is a propaganda and political podium that 
contributes to supporting resistance and deals with problems in 
areas near the Israeli border. 
  The Hizballah deputy secretary general said the party has 
opened a dialogue with the Christians that is still in progress. 
He added that every Lebanese has the right to live in Lebanon 
and express his view quite freely. Should General Michel 'Awn, 
Raymond Iddih, or former President Amin al-Jumayyil decide to 
return to Lebanon, they would be returning to their homeland, he 
said.

  [Text] A responsible source has revealed that the 
government will broach the issue of the joint waters of the 
al-Yarmuk River with Syria after reaching an agreement with 
Israel in the talks slated to be held in the region next month. 
  The source, which requested anonymity, added that Jordan 
feels that it is being done an injustice by the Syrian 
practices, particularly since Syria is monopolizing the use of 
the al-Yarmuk River tributaries by building dams on them. The 
source noted that Jordan was sympathetic with the Syrian 
position before the start of the peace process. But, now, Syria 
must seriously examine our grievances, the source said.

  [Text] Tehran, June 28, (IRNA) -- President Akbar 
Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday [28 June] praised Tir Seventh 
(June 28th) martyrs as "unique personalities and valuable assets 
of Islamic system" [punctuation as received] 
  Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani made the remark in a meeting with 
families of the martyrs killed in a bomb explosion at the 
headquarters of the Islamic Republic Party. The bomb was 
planted by terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) on June 
28, 1981. 
  "You, survivors of 72 martyrs, should never feel that you 
have lost anything, rather you should follow the holy path of 
the martyrs in your thoughts and deeds and be loyal to them... 
This is victory in itself," president told the audience. 
  He touched on the important role the martyrs played in 
promoting Islamic revolution and sovereignty of Islamic Republic 
of Iran's system and referred to events in early years of the 
Islamic revolution and the efforts spent by deviant and 
destructive trends to defeat Iran's Islamic revolution. 
  He said such deviant political trends as nationalists, 
leftists and hypocrites in collaboration with foreign forces 
tried to prevent formation of a system based on Quranic 
principles and revolutionary Islam. 
  "Thank's God [as received] that they failed to do so in 
light 
of people's presence in the (political) scene and under the 
leadership of the father of Islamic revolution, the late Imam 
Khomeini," said the president. 
  Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani said the destruction of Islamic 
Republic Party headquarters and martyrdom of 72 top persons led 
by Ayatollah Dr. Mohammad Hossein Beheshti demolished enemies 
from inside and persuaded people and public opinion to further 
support officials of the system proceeding on the path of the 
late Imam Khomeini. 
  He said that hypocrites and enemies of Islamic revolution 
took their revenge on people, but God destined them to suffer 
profound regret for a long time and took back all things from 
them, made them hollow men and alienated them from revolution 
and the country. 
  President referred to hypocrites' terrorist operations in 
June 28, 1981 as an event similar to that of Mashhad on Ashura 
(June 20) and said such crimes unveiled real nature and savage 
behavior of the false proponents of democracy and human rights 
before the world and Iranian people's public opinion and brought 
them notoriety. 
  Rafsanjani wished Islamic revolution martyrs spiritual 
elevation and their bereaved families patience in following Imam 
Khomeini's sacred path.

  [Text] Cairo, June 28 (AFP) - Doctors found 17 wounds on 
the body of a lawyer who died in police custody here, the bar 
association said Tuesday [28 June]. 
  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the association's head in Cairo, 
told 
reporters that national bar association chief Ahmad al-Khawajah 
was informed of the medical report's contents by the state 
prosecutor. Muhammad said the report into the death of Islamic 
lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani mentioned "17 injury marks on 
various parts of the victim's body," without giving more details. 
  The lawyers' association launched a protest campaign after 
Madani's death in police custody on April 17, charging that he 
died under torture. The interior ministry said an asthma attack 
was to blame. 
  According to the Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights a 
total of 37 lawyers were arrested during the campaign, which 
included a rally brutally stopped by police on May 17. Some 28 
out of the 37 have been freed up to now, the group said. 
  A group of 33 lawyers decided last week to go on hunger 
strike demanding the release of the lawyers and the publication 
of the findings into Madani's death. 
Muhammad said 27 of the hunger strikers had now ended their 
protest deeming that the authorities had "met their demands." 
  But some of their colleagues had accused them of giving in.

  [Text] For the first time since the Yemeni battles started, 
representatives of the conflicting sides met in New York 
yesterday. AFP reports that the two sides could not set a date 
for a cease-fire. The talks, which were held in the presence of 
Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary general's special envoy for 
Yemeni affairs, were attended by 'Abd al-Karim al-Iryani, 
Yemen's planning and development minister, representing the 
northern forces, and Haydar Abu Bakr al-'Attas, representing the 
southern forces. 
  The official Yemeni news agency has reported that 'Ali Salim 
al-Bid, who was living in al-Mukalla in east Aden, was wounded 
and has gone to an Arab country for treatment. The news agency 
has not revealed the name of the Arab country. 
  Another report citing the official Yemeni news agency states 
that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has accused the 
southerners of trying to internationalize the Yemeni war. 
Speaking with Egyptian President Husni Mubarak on the phone 
yesterday, he said the southerners are thus trying to achieve 
their expansionist objectives.

    [Editorial Report] The following is a comprehensive review 
of all items in the 24 June issue of the Arabic-language 
newspaper Cairo AL-SHA'B that pertain to political Islamic 
issues. 
<H5>  CONTENTS: </H5>
  1. Lawyers Escalate Anti-Government Protests 
  2. Prominent Journalist Urges Better Relations with Iran 
  3. Document Shows West Scheming To Reduce Muslim 
Population 
  4. Writers View Islamists' Ability To Govern 
  5. Omani Authorities Arrest Islamists 
  6. Washington Drafts Plans Against Algeria's Islamists 
  7. Turkish Islamic Party Said Winning More Support 
<H5>  LAWYERS ESCALATE ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS </H5>
  An 800-word report by Khalid Yunus on pages 1 and 7 deals 
with the development of the crisis between the Lawyers 
Association [LA] and the government. The report says 
'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad, the chief of the LA Cairo branch, who 
has been staging a hunger strike to support demands for the 
release of the detained lawyers and the holding of an inquiry 
into the death of Islamist lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani while in 
police custody, has been taken to the hospital after a serious 
deterioration in his health. The Egyptian Organization for 
Human Rights reportedly issued a "press release" calling on the 
Egyptian Government to meet Muhammad's lawful demands to save 
his life. The report says that scores of lawyers began a sit-in 
in the LA headquarters in solidarity with Muhammad, and that 
some of them joined in the hunger strike. 
  --A related unattributed 150-word report on pages 1 and 7 
says the LA branch in Ismailia decided to hold a general 
congress Thursday, 30 June, as part of the lawyers' activities 
against the detention of their colleagues and the government's 
failure to "bring the officers responsible for the death of 
lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani to trial." 
  --An 80-word boxed announcement extending over two long 
columns on page 1 and signed by LA Doyen Ahmad al-Khawajah and 
LA Secretary General Ahmad Sayf al-Islam says that the LA 
Council decided at a 19 June meeting that: 1. Lawyers shall 
not attend two prosecution sessions on 28 and 29 June to renew 
the detention order of the lawyers. 2. Lawyers shall stage a 
general strike on 28 and 29 June "to protest the continuing 
aggression against lawyers and the legal profession." The 
announcement says disciplinary measures will be taken against 
violators of the two decisions. 
<H5>  PROMINENT JOURNALIST URGES BETTER RELATIONS WITH IRAN </H5>
  A 600-word front page report by Ashraf Khalil cites 
well-known Egyptian journalist Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal as 
calling for improving relations with Iran and healing the rift 
between the two major regional powers. Haykal reportedly told a 
Cairo seminar on Iranian-Arab relations that the Egyptian 
leadership is largely to blame for the bad relations between 
Cairo and Tehran. He said no one has produced a bit of evidence 
that Iran supports terrorist acts in Egypt. "I believe that 
direct action in Egypt is against Iran's interests, and I 
believe that the Islamists in Egypt -- and they are Sunnis -- 
are far from being influenced by the [Shiite] Iranian 
authorities," Haykal is quoted as saying. 
<H5>  DOCUMENT SHOWS WEST SCHEMING TO REDUCE MUSLIM POPULATION </H5>
  An approximately 2,500-word report by 'Abd-al-Hayy Muhammad 
on page 3 discusses "a serious document" obtained by the paper 
on U.S. and Western schemes to reduce population growth in the 
Islamic world and thus weaken the Islamic nation. The document, 
headlined "International Campaign to Destroy Islam," reportedly 
"reveals new aggression by the U.S. AID against the Muslim 
countries." It recounts the U.S. agency's birth-control efforts 
and programs in countries like Nigeria, Niger, Egypt, and 
Jordan. It says the agency depends on local religious leaders, 
secular women activists, and the private Future Group of the 
United States to implement these programs. The document says 
the plans to reduce the population of the Muslim world, which 
are given appealing names like "birth control" and "time 
intervals between births," are facing major difficulties thanks 
to Islamic opposition, which has largely managed to convince 
Muslims that birth control is a sin. The document, whose source 
is not given, discusses the strategy of the United States and 
the NATO alliance to deal with the population growth in the 
Islamic countries. It reportedly says that "the rising 
population growth rate in the Islamic world, at a time when the 
Western countries and the United States are recording low 
population growth rates, will necessarily lead to a war against 
the Muslims--a war in which NATO will use its influence, power, 
and intelligence resources to contain the growing threat of 
Islam." The document says all indications are that the Islamic 
countries will grow more powerful in the future and the 
international balance of power will change in the next 20 years 
as a result of the growing population rates. Therefore, "the 
United States and NATO should do their utmost to curb the 
population growth in the Islamic world and control its natural 
resources," the document concludes. 

<H5>    WRITERS VIEW ISLAMISTS' ABILITY TO GOVERN </H5>
  AL-SHA'B carries on page 9 an approximately 2,000-word 
article by Egyptian writer Muhammad Hasanayn Haykal and a 
1,500-word "comment" on the article, signed with the initials 
M.A.H., presumably the newspaper's Chief Editor Majdi Ahmad 
Husayn. Haykal's article, which mainly discusses the Islamic 
experience in Algeria and its repercussions on the Muslim world, 
first appeared in the Japanese newspaper YOMIURI SHIMBUN "some 
time ago" according to the introduction. In his article, Haykal 
criticizes the Algerian Government and Army for obstructing the 
Islamists' attempt to reach power through democratic elections. 
He notes that the Islamic Salvation Front in Algeria, like the 
other political Islam movements in the Muslim world, lack 
specific programs and plans that can help them to effectively 
solve the problems of the people once they reach power. The 
Islamic movements, Haykal adds, lack in the leading cadres to 
implement their political ideas. Haykal also notes traditional 
U.S and Arab Gulf support for the Islamic movements against 
secular nationalist forces. 
  In his commentary, Husayn says that in the absence of real 
democracy, where the road to government is open to any political 
force, the opposition can only have general plans and ideas, not 
specific programs and detailed institutions. He maintains that 
the Islamic movement, in its general inclinations and broad 
vision, offers a clearer and more defined program than that 
offered in the past by the pan-Arab, leftist, and liberal forces 
when they were in the center of opposition. He notes that all 
political groups come to power with general principles and 
inclinations that may be amended and adjusted as practical 
experience dictates. He says: "It is true that the Islamic 
creed does not commit Muslim to certain constitutional 
establishments, an economic theory, or a foreign policy, but it 
offers terms of reference to all these -- that is, general 
constitutional principles. Islam has general principles 
governing relations between the ruler and the ruled, and general 
rules and principles governing economic life." He also notes 
general principles that define the relations between the Islamic 
state and the foreign world. Concerning the lack of Islamic 
leading cadres, Husayn says that even if this is true, it does 
not mean a Muslim government will fail. The scarcity of 
leaders, he argues, is a traditional problem that has faced 
every new movement seeking radical change in society, but there 
are short-term and long-term solutions. Regarding the role of 
the United States and the traditional Arab governments in the 
Islamic revival, Husayn says those parties tried to use the 
Islamic movements in the past, when the pan-Arab movement was 
the source of revolutionary anger. "Now however, the 
revolutionary awakening comes from the Islamic movements 
themselves, and this is problem number one for U.S. policy." 
Husayn concludes that "the Islamic awakening is a return to the 
nation's identity," not a reaction to frustration or a response 
to foreign support. 
<H5>  OMANI AUTHORITIES ARREST ISLAMISTS </H5>
  An "exclusive" unattributed 120-word report on page 7 says 
that the Omani authorities, in an unprecedented move, have 
arrested 70 Islamists of Omani, Sudanese, and Jordanian 
nationalities and closed a number of Islamic libraries in that 
country. Among the detainees, the report says, is Muhammad 
Bin-Ahmad al-Ghazali, undersecretary of the Ministry of 
Agriculture and Fishery; his two brothers; a judge; and an Air 
Force officer. Sudanese and Jordanian university professors 
were also arrested, according to the report. 
<H5>  WASHINGTON PREPARES PLANS AGAINST ALGERIA'S ISLAMISTS </H5>
  An unattributed 150-word report on page 7 claims that the 
United States "has prepared a new security plan to confront the 
Islamists in Algeria." The report cites information that the 
recent meeting between the Algerian foreign minister and U.S. 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake dealt with "new American 
ideas to combat the Islamic phenomenon in Algeria." According 
to the information, the United States is asking that the U.S. 
intelligence agencies and the National Security Council be given 
a major role in security planning for Algeria. The United 
States reportedly expressed readiness to support the Algerian 
Government forces, but wanted the Army to get rid of the 
elements that support religious activity. 
<H5>  TURKISH ISLAMIC PARTY SAID WINNING MORE SUPPORT </H5>
  In an approximately 3,500-word report from Istanbul, Chief 
Editor Majdi Ahmad Husayn discusses from an Islamic perspective 
the Turkish developments and challenges, such as the Kurdish 
problem and the economic crisis. He concludes that "Turkey is 
at a decisive crossroads. Its secular option and its link with 
the Western European camp have reached, or almost reached, a 
dead end." He says the government can no longer tackle the 
major challenges of territorial unity, economic crisis, and the 
lost dignity. All this, he contends, is increasingly helping 
the Islamic Welfare Party, which may win twice as many seats in 
the 1996 elections as it won in this year's election.

<F P=106> [Telephone interview with Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive </F>
Committee member, "who returned to Jericho today after 20 years 
of exile," by Sa'id Mu'addi in Jericho on 28 June; from the 
"With the Events" program -- recorded] 
  [Text] [Mu'addi] Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive 
Committee member, God be praised for your safe return. You are 
welcome to Jericho. 
  [Al-Najjab] Thank you, Sa'id. 
  [Mu'addi] Twenty years after deportation, you have now 
returned to the Gaza and Jericho autonomous areas although you 
are not member of the Palestinian administration. What is your 
comment? 
  [Al-Najjab] I have returned to the homeland. Our stand on 
the Cairo agreement is well-known. Therefore, we have not 
participated in the government. However, I believe that our 
work to implement Resolution 242 in all its provisions and 
ensure the Israeli withdrawal from our occupied territory can 
also be done from the autonomous areas. This, of course, is not 
confined to areas from which the Israeli Army has withdrawn so 
far. I mean quote, withdrawn, unquote, of course. 
  We are proud of the role that we as a party have played 
within the PLO to reach the declaration on the well-known 
Palestinian peace initiative in 1988 when the PLO's official 
policy became the policy of working to reach a political 
settlement based on implementing Resolution 242. 
  [Mu'addi] Then will you join the factions that are opposed 
to 
the Israeli-Palestinian agreement? 
  [Al-Najjab] We will not join factions opposed to 
negotiations. We are constructive opposition. We support 
negotiations and a political settlement. Our opposition differs 
from the other factions that refused the participation in Madrid 
conference and that rejected the Oslo agreement. But we also 
differ with the Palestinian factions that signed the Cairo 
agreement. Our differences and our rejection of the Cairo 
agreement basically stems from our serious work to reach a firm 
political settlement. I do not believe that it is possible to 
reach such a settlement by ignoring the Palestinian people's 
rights and circumventing the resolutions of international 
legitimacy. 
  [Mu'addi] What will be the basis of your political activity 
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to promote the aims of the 
political trend you represent? 
  [Al-Najjab] We consider that the aim of realizing 
Palestinian 
national independence through a political settlement continues 
to be our basic aim. Our stand toward the Palestinian authority 
is contingent on the stand and work of this authority to realize 
this objective; namely, independence. We support the authority 
in all its steps that serve this objective. We, along with all 
the Palestinian national forces, are working to solve problems 
that the agreement has not succeeded in solving. Foremost of 
these problems now is the issue of the detainees and political 
prisoners. It has transpired that the agreement's provisions on 
this issue have failed to solve it. All the political detainees 
and prisoners must be released if the peace process is to gain 
credibility among the Palestinian people. 
  [Mu'addi] Thank you, Mr. Sulayman al-Najjab, and God be 
praised for your safe return. 
  [Al-Najjab] Thank you, and before I end this interview I 
would like to reiterate that the continuation of the siege on 
Jerusalem and attempts at changing the reality there and the 
attempt to expand the settlements will not serve the peace 
process. They do not conform to peace at all. Postponing these 
two issues to the final phase of the negotiations does not mean 
giving the Israeli side a free hand to impose new realities that 
will affect the final result of the negotiations. 
  [Mu'addi] Thank you very much. 
  [Al-Najjab] Thank you, Sa'id, thank you.

<F P=106> [Interview with Sulayman al-Najjab, PLO Executive Committee </F>
member and leader of the Palestinian People's Party, by Fathi 
al-Barqawi in Tunis; date not given -- first paragraph is 
al-Barqawi introduction] 
  [Text] We first asked about what Palestinian President 
Yasir 'Arafat was quoted as saying several days ago, that some 
opposition factions would soon take stands in support of the 
agreement [with Israel] and that some of these factions had made 
contacts with the aim of participation in the National Authority 
Council. Was the People's Party one of these factions? 
  [Al-Najjab] We are not one of them. We did not accept the 
Cairo agreement which carefully defines the authority's marginal 
powers as evident in all the agreement's articles and 
appendixes. We still believe that the Palestinian people's main 
task is to end the occupation, achieve national independence, 
and find a solution to the refugee problem in accordance with 
the UN resolutions. We do not see anything in any of the Cairo 
agreement articles that will take us closer to that objective. 
That is why we will continue to struggle, outside the 
authority, for liberation, but we will support the authority if 
it contributes to the struggle against the occupation. 
  [Al-Barqawi] But how can you support the authority without 
being part of it? 
  [Al-Najjab] There are some tangible issues such as the 
Arabism of Jerusalem, resisting settlements, the detainees, and 
the Israeli repressive measures. If the authority contributes 
to the defense of these causes, it would find us with it in the 
same trench. 
  [Al-Barqawi] So there are points of agreement. 
  [Al-Najjab] We want to remain in touch with the authority, 
with the common objective of resisting occupation, preventing 
intensification of national division, and preventing 
inter-Palestinian fighting, and at the same time secure the 
opposition's right to struggle against the agreement by 
political and democratic means. 
  [Al-Barqawi] Is there a danger of inter-Palestinian fighting 
on the horizon? 
  [Al-Najjab] We are satisfied with the statements issued by 
all parties prohibiting infighting, but it is not just a matter 
of intentions. There are gaps in the agreement itself. For 
instance, under the agreement, the authority is committed to 
hand over everyone considered by Israel to be a threat to its 
security. If the Palestinian police implemented that provision, 
then there would be a threat of collision. Israel also insists 
that arms should only be in the possession of the police, hence 
the call for arms to be collected from the people. Some of 
these arms, used against the honor, property, and lives of the 
public, should be taken away because that would fulfill a 
national need. However, some arms could be used against the 
occupation so long as it is there. Administrative decisions do 
not solve that problem. It is, above all, a political issue and 
the dispute over it could lead to friction. That is why our 
party has suggested to both the authority and the opposition the 
idea of forming an authoritative national committee, with 
representatives from both sides, that would have the task of 
dealing with this sensitive issue and making decisions in the 
interest of national unity provided it is equally binding on all 
parties. 
  [Al-Barqawi] Has that proposal produced any results? 
  [Al-Najjab] Everyone has expressed appreciation and saw it 
as a serious proposal, and we are waiting for the replies. 
  [Al-Barqawi] Regarding the agreement which you oppose, do 
you not see a possibility of improving its terms? 
  [Al-Najjab] That would have been possible before the 
agreement was signed, and that is what we called for during the 
negotiations. The articles of the agreement that have been made 
public fully restrict the authority. We are watching its 
implementation, and that includes the approach to the various 
disputed issues such as the detainees issue. The [released] 
detainees' residence has been confined to Jericho until the 
expiry of their prison term. That is stipulated in the 
agreement. The same kind of thing applies to the authority's 
offices in Arab Jerusalem and the laws to be enforced in the 
transitional period. The agreement commits the authority to 
maintaining all the laws and military orders which were in force 
when the agreement was signed. There is also another provision 
which stipulates that the authority can only have offices in 
Gaza and Jericho. Israel is trying to use that provision as a 
cover for its known policy of clearing Palestinian national 
institutions out of Jerusalem. 
  The authority should take a firm position on all these 
issues, the same position taken by the patriotic forces 
including the People's Party, upholding struggle for the release 
of all the detainees, return of the deportees, deletion of 
anything preventing that from the provisions of the agreement 
itself, and defense of the national institutions in Jerusalem. 
  [Al-Barqawi] You are in Tunis for the closure of the office 
of the Social Affairs Department which you head. How is that to 
be interpreted? 
  [Al-Najjab] There is some confusion which should be cleared 
up, and awareness should be heightened. The PLO is one thing 
and the authority quite another. The PLO is necessary because 
it still has not completed its national program specified in the 
peace initiative approved by the [Palestine] National Council in 
1988. The PLO is still the Palestinian people's moral home and 
the symbol of their unity and common cause. The PLO has made 
major achievements including the vast world recognition of the 
Palestinian state, and it is the only body that can protect 
these gains. The authority, according to the agreement, is not 
allowed to have diplomatic relations with anyone, and its 
responsibilities are kept within the confines of the agreement 
and its implementation. It is not permitted to raise issues 
that have been postponed until the final phase, such as 
Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, and the settlements. 
Therefore, the PLO should alone continue to mobilize and 
concentrate on these issues and urge the United Nations, the 
Security Council, and the international community [to tackle 
them]. It should also insist on the resolutions pertaining to 
these issues and should resist Israeli practices aimed at 
perpetuating the status quo. The PLO should continue to seek to 
dispel the widespread delusion that the Palestinian question has 
been resolved just as the South African question has been 
resolved. True, the authority does, for instance, have a social 
security department in the occupied territory with specific 
powers, but the Palestinian people in the diaspora still have 
social issues which the PLO and its departments should continue 
to shoulder the responsibilities for, and the same applies to 
most departments. What is important now is that the PLO should 
create new departments for such issues as Jerusalem and 
settlement, and should keep the Returnees Affairs Department and 
the Political Department. 
  We have submitted these ideas to the leadership and we hope 
that it will study them and respond in a way that would serve 
continuation of the national struggle. 
  [Al-Barqawi] The supporters of the agreement consider what 
has been accomplished as just an interim step to be followed by 
other steps such as legislative elections in the future. What 
is your position on such elections? 
  [Al-Najjab] Yes, it is a step, but in what direction? It 
should be in the direction of ending the occupation, and the 
transition should be from a reality of occupation to a reality 
that would rid us of that occupation. We do not see anything in 
the agreement that would help that. The agreement adopted the 
Israeli concept of the transitional period and its function. 
That, at best, would only lead to the implementation of the 
Israeli Labor Party's program based on withdrawal from the 
densely populated areas, which are small areas not appropriate 
for the Palestinians to exercise their right of 
self-determination in. As regards elections, the danger is that 
according to the agreement, they should merely be elections for 
the present authority's council with some "legislative and 
executive powers." If that is the case, it would be difficult 
to participate. The battle should be started from now for a 
separate legislative council that would form and supervise the 
work of an executive council. 
  [Al-Barqawi] If the Palestine Central Council was summoned 
to a meeting, would you participate in its work? 
  [Al-Najjab] We are surprised that the Central Council has 
not been summoned to a meeting to consider the agreement. The 
question we ask now is: What would be the Central Council's 
agenda if it indeed was called to a meeting?

  [Text] Ramallah -- Ghassan al-Khatib, former member of the 
Palestinian negotiating delegation and a leading People's Party 
personality, has said that the Cairo accord has shown many 
differences and problems in each step of its implementation. 
Al-Khatib attributed this to the accord's nature, which is 
characterized in placing numerous restrictions on the work of 
the Palestinian authority. 
  He explained that the most prominent example of that is 
implementation of the clause relating to the prisoners whose 
problem has now blown up in the face of everyone. This has 
created a serious test for the new arrangements and for the 
accord itself. 
  Al-Khatib referred to the danger of the continued separation 
of the Gaza Strip from the West Bank. He said that this 
separation, which stems from the accord's division, will create 
contrasting realities and harm the unity of the land and people 
if it were to continue. 
  Al-Khatib criticized the Palestinian performance in 
implementing the accord. He said that this performance actually 
adds other restrictions to the accord. He noted that the 
performance is still marked by chaos and lack of planning, which 
in practice has affected the speed in decisionmaking and the 
ability of the Palestinian Authority council to start its work. 
Al-Khatib said that the meeting held yesterday by the national 
authority lacked a quorum because less than half the members 
were present.

  [Excerpt] Israeli authorities have approved the return of 
all Fatah Central Committee members to the self-rule area. 
AL-DUSTUR has learned that 15 Central Committee members will 
accompany President Yasir 'Arafat when he returns to the Gaza 
Strip. 
  Informed sources have told AL-DUSTUR that the Israeli 
authorities have excluded Major General Muhammad Jihad from 
those who were allowed to return. Maj. Gen. Muhammad Jihad 
leads the hardliners within Fatah who oppose negotiations with 
Israel and any agreements that result from them. 
  The informed military sources said this hardline trend 
comprises many military people. It works within Fatah against 
the negotiations and is active at Fatah Central Committee and 
Revolutionary Council meetings in support of a reinvigorated 
intifadah. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Israel released 389 Palestinian prisoners from the 
Qezi'ot jail today. Buses took them via Nahal 'Oz to the Gaza 
Strip. Most of the freed prisoners are members of the Hamas 
[Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad groups which 
oppose the peace process. Hundreds of Palestinians welcomed 
them in Gaza with a large procession. 
  The Israeli Army says about 4,000 Palestinian prisoners have 
been released since the Cairo agreement with the PLO signed on 
the 4th of May. Under the agreement Israel said it would free 
some 5,000 prisoners. 
  The Palestinian police in Jericho said it would refuse to 
let 
in the 200 prisoners due to be taken there today. The prisoners 
signed statements that they would remain in the self-rule areas 
and not oppose the Israel-PLO peace accord with violence.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, </F>
member of the Political Bureau of the Islamic Resistance 
Movement, in Damascus; date not given] 
  [Text] Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq, member of the Political Bureau 
of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), has denied the 
existence in Hamas of a trend that supports the Oslo agreement 
or participation in the elections "at the present time." He 
affirmed that the Movement "is immune to division" and that its 
detained cadres did not sign the document pledging not to resort 
to violence except after the deletion of the part on support for 
the Oslo agreement. 
  He said that the truce with Israel has been there since the 
birth of Israel and that "it did not mean recognition, just 
postponement of the conflict." 
  In an interview with AL-HAYAH, Abu-Marzuq said that all the 
Hamas detainees had refused to sign the document, "which was 
rejected by Hamas because it included support (for the Oslo 
agreement) and nonopposition to the recent agreements between 
the PLO and Israel." He said that "when that provision was 
deleted and the old version, which the detainees used to sign, 
was revived, the central command in the prisons ordered the 
Movement's detainees to sign, with the exception of that command 
itself." 
  In his interview, which was held in Damascus, the Hamas 
Political Bureau member reaffirmed Hamas' position on the 
autonomy authority, "which has not changed. We oppose it (the 
agreement) politically and at the popular level and we seek to 
mobilize the people against it in order to revoke it and 
preserve the Palestinian people's rights to their territory, 
full and undiminished." He said that the Israeli forces did not 
withdraw from Gaza and Jericho. We did not feel their 
withdrawal. They were redeployed. That is why our firm policy 
is to resist and confront the occupation." [quotation mark as 
published] 
  Abu-Marzuq said that the expected elections in Gaza and 
Jericho "are bound by ceilings imposed by the Oslo and Cairo 
agreements. They will not be free elections and will be a 
violation of the Palestinian people's right to say what kind of 
leadership they want and what political course relects their 
views." He asked: "What is the meaning of elections while 
there is Israeli occupation and sovereignty on the ground? The 
elections should be rejected and there should be no 
participation in them. The arena is not restricted to 
(President) Yasir 'Arafat and Fatah. We challenge them to first 
hold a Palestinian referendum on the agreement itself to find 
out what the people think first." He said that Fatah would be 
risking its history and future when it comes inside [the 
territories] and participates in the elections. 
  Asked about the existence of a trend in Hamas that supported 
participation in the elections, he replied: "The Movement's 
general trend and unanimous view is refusal to participate at 
this stage. We are not required to politicize our cadres. We 
want to prepare them for resistance against the occupation and 
for the preservation of the Palestinian people's rights." 
  Abu-Marzuq, who visited Damascus recently and attended the 
meeting of the Central Command of the Alliance of Palestinian 
Forces [APF], said that "the truce (with Israel) has been in 
existence since the emergence of the enemy state. The lines 
between the Arab states and the enemy state are armistice lines 
but a truce does not mean recognition, just a postponement of 
the conflict." 
  He stressed that Hamas is immune to division. He said: "We 
are a Palestinian faction, but to apply factional divisions to 
us is out of the question. Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] tried the 
various skills he used on others but failed with us. I do not 
believe that his movement is as immune to division as Hamas." 
He added that he has been hearing about a split "for years, but 
it never occurred." 
  He denied that it is coming under pressure from any party. 
He asked: "Where are the parties which back us and support the 
agreement? What form of aid do they give us? What pressures 
would they put on the Movement if it continued to oppose the 
agreement?" He emphasized that the Hamas leadership makes the 
political decisions "and it knows that its decisions stem from 
its own institutions, and nobody has the means to put pressure 
on us." He affirmed that no one in Hamas supported the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement "whether inside or outside [the 
territories]." 
  On his meeting with [Syrian] Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim 
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' two days ago, 
Abu-Marzuq said that the two meetings were held "in the course 
of the Movement's political moves to hold consultations, explain 
its positions, and discuss a better future for our region." He 
added that the two meetings "strengthened steadfastness against 
the designs aimed at splitting the positions which reflect the 
nation's hopes and aspirations."

  [Excerpt] A Western diplomatic source has said that Slovak 
Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan, who visited Damascus last week 
and met with senior Syrian officials, has signed an agreement 
with the Syrian side stipulating the sale of 250 tanks of an 
advanced type to Syria. 
  The source said Damascus is continuing to modernize the 
weaponary of its military institutions by both old and new 
relations with several non-Western nations, including Russia, 
the PRC, Korea, India, and now Slovakia, which inherited huge 
weapons factories from the mother country (Czechoslovakia). 
  The source said this policy is based on Damascus' view that 
"comprehensive peace," stipulated by the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle, is 
facing deliberate Israeli obstruction. [passage omitted]

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] Under the headline of "Peace of the Massacres," 
AL-THAWRAH comments on the Israeli report on the massacre at the 
holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. It says: We did not expect 
that the Israeli judiciary, which is tailored to suit Israeli 
foreign propaganda, would condemn Rabin's government or hold it 
responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. 
  The objectives of the Shamgar Commission's task are known. 
They are designed to clear the Israeli government and its army 
of responsibility for the blood of the victims of treacherous 
Israeli terrorism, to improve the Israeli image, and to 
eliminate the negative impact of the massacres on international 
public opinion. 
  The newspaper emphasizes the danger signal that should draw 
our attention, which is that the Israeli government -- which the 
Shamgar Commission's report did not hold at all responsibile -- 
has warned, in a statement by Yitzhaq Rabin himself, that there 
is no guarantee that another massacre can be prevented. 
  According to Rabin, terrorism and actions by mad people 
cannot be controlled by his security organizations. In a 
comment on the Commission's report, General Ehud Baraq, Israeli 
chief of staff, literally said he cannot guarantee that such 
incidents will not recur. 
  A thorough reading of Rabin and Baraq's statements, 
AL-THAWRAH says, makes it apparent that Rabin and Baraq expect 
more massacres in the future. 
  The newspaper says the report gives the green light to 
settlers to commit more massacres. The report intentionally 
covers the nature of the circumstances in which the crime was 
carried. These circumstances urge Rabin and Baraq to emphasize 
that other massacres are possible and claim that the occupation 
army will not stop these massacres.

  [Text] As soon as a possible date for a new tour by U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher to the region was 
announced, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rushed to hint 
that this tour will fail just like previous tours in the region 
by the U.S. secretary of state. Israel seems to be deliberately 
seeking to keep the peace process at a standstill and uses its 
methods, which oppose the achievement of the just and 
comprehensive peace, to bring the peace process to a dead end 
and foil the U.S. and world efforts to boost this process. 
  Of course, these Israeli methods are not new. They are as 
old as the peace process itself. They date back to the time of 
the Madrid Conference more than two and a half years ago and to 
the time when Israel found itself in a political crisis, which 
it is trying to escape by placing obstacles and hurdles on the 
path of the peace process, by avoiding the dues of the just and 
comprehensive peace, by deviating from the Madrid formula, and 
by not abiding by the principle of returning land in exchange 
for peace. 
  The Israeli political crisis stems from the fact that the 
just and comprehensive peace imposes upon it full withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights, southern Lebanon, and the other occupied 
Arab territories. Because Israel is not interested in 
withdrawal or in activating the peace process, it is trying to 
blame others for the failure to achieve positive progress. At 
the same time, it increases its allegations, falsehoods, and 
justifications to avoid the dues of the just and honorable 
peace. This can be clearly seen in the Israeli position that 
contradicts in form and substance the just and comprehensive 
peace, and by Israel's adherence to everything except the 
ingredients and principles of that peace. Accordingly, Israel 
sticks to the proposals of partial solutions and separate 
settlements. It also sticks to the slogan "Peace in Return for 
Peace" because it does not want to implement the resolutions of 
international legitimacy and does not want to completely 
withdraw from the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon. It wants 
to see weak Arab parties on which it can impose its conditions 
and ideas and push them into further surrender and 
relinquishment of Arab rights, and who will accept its 
occupation, and the continuation of that occupation of Arab 
territories. 
  The Syrian position is totally different. That position 
responded favorably to the principles of the peace process and 
its true ingredients. That position also placed Israel in a 
real dilemma. Syria, which opened the road toward peace by 
accepting the U.S. initiative, adheres to the principles of the 
just and comprehensive peace and the objectives of the peace 
process. 
  Syria, as everybody knows, has announced its clear 
commitment 
to implement the UN resolutions, on which the peace process and 
the U.S. initiative were based. Syria also responded favorably 
to all requirements of the just and comprehensive peace. On 
more than one occasion, Syria helped rescue the peace process 
from Israel's conspiracies and plans to torpedo and sabotage it. 
  Israel continues to place obstacles and hurdles on the path 
of the just, comprehensive, genuine peace. It publicly advocates 
replacing the Washington talks and the principles of the Madrid 
Conference with separate, secret talks. Moreover, Israel 
exercised an aggressive policy and did not stop the series of 
bombardment and its crimes, suppression, and terrorism in 
Lebanon and the occupied Arab territories. Israel is now taking 
strict measures to tighten its grip, entrench its occupation, 
and expand its suppression in the occupied Arab territories. 
  This Israeli arrogance would not have taken such a serious 
turn if the world community had assumed its responsibility and 
defended its principles, resolutions, and charters; and if the 
United States had adopted a decisive position against Israel's 
vandalism against its peace initiative. It is now clear that in 
the light of the Israeli practices and positions, which run 
counter to peace, that it is impossible to arrive at a just and 
comprehensive peace and stability and tranquility in the region 
without an effective U.S. and world intervention to pressure 
Israel. Consequently, commitments and obligations must be 
translated into a reality on the ground. As much as it is 
interested in achieving peace, Syria sticks to the return of the 
entire Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the occupied Arab 
territories. Syria will not relinquish a grain of its national 
and pan-Arab soil. Every one knows that there can never be 
peace without Syria and without its positive and constructive 
role in making genuine peace.

<F P=106> [From the press review] </F>
  [Text] In an editorial entitled "The Peace Process Under 
The Shadow Of Israeli Threats," AL-BA'TH discusses Israeli 
officials' threatening statements. The paper says: It is clear 
that with their new threats, Israeli officials want to exert 
further pressure against Syria and push it to do what the others 
have done, that is, abandon its rights. 
  The paper stresses that Syria will never relinquish an inch 
of its occupied lands and that such threats will push it to 
stick even further to its rights, and, consequently, to work for 
the sake of a genuine peace in the region. 
  AL-BA'TH says: Thus, there is no doubt that Israel wants a 
peace which will enable it to achieve what it failed to achieve 
in all its aggressive wars against the Arabs. Consequently, it 
maneuvers, procrastinates, and delays the peace process. 
Whenever substantive issues are raised for serious discussion, 
Israel evades them and starts raising secondary issues that do 
not concern the basic principles on which the peace process is 
based. 
  The paper adds: Syria says complete and comprehensive 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the other 
occupied Arab territories will achieve the just and 
comprehensive peace. The implementation of this requirement is 
the cornerstone in the peace process. 
  AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: We in Syria went to the Madrid 
Conference out of a genuine and true desire to achieve a just 
and comprehensive peace. We still, and will continue to, work 
with everyone for the sake of achieving a peace that will 
guarantee security, stability, and genuine peace to the region.

<F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>
  [Text] Gentlemen: In the wake of the aggressive Israeli 
attacks in the Lebanese skies and on the Lebanese territories 
and the occupied Palestinian lands, Yitzhaq Rabin has made 
threatening statements to undermine Syria's firm quest for a 
just and comprehensive peace. As a matter of fact, this Israeli 
pressure is nothing new. These statements are as old as the 
peace process launched by the Madrid conference. For, similar 
statements have continued to be made since the start of the 
Washington bilateral talks up to date. Their pressure has taken 
the form of evasion and maneuvering. However, they have now 
begun to take the form of threatening aggression since the 
conclusion of distorted and flawed agreements, such as the 
Gaza-Jericho agreement. 
  The entire world community has seen Israel attempting to 
kill 
the peace process, and to preoccupy it with formalities and 
procedural matters in a bid to circumvent any discussion of 
substantive issues. This has been meant to evade the 
requirements of peace; namely, complete Israeli withdrawal from 
the occupied Arab territories in compliance with the well-known 
UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. 
  In the wake of this evasion and these maneuvers, Israel 
posed 
insincere questions about the kind of peace Syria is offering. 
It is to be recalled that the peace Syria is offering is 
crystal clear. It has to be just and comprehensive. This was 
well put by His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad when he said 
that Syria is offering full peace in return for complete 
withdrawal. Since then, we have heard statements by Yitzhaq 
Rabin about withdrawal on the Golan, rather than from the Golan. 
Then, we heard provocative Israeli statements regarding an 
Israeli referendum on the future of the occupied Golan, as if 
the UN Security Council did not pass a resolution providing for 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in 1967; namely, Resolution 
242, which was later augmented by Resolution 338. Israel has 
behaved as if withdrawal from the Arab territories is an issue 
that must remain hostage to Israeli whims. As a matter of fact, 
this withdrawal is required in compliance with the 
aforementioned UN resolution to vindicate right and achieve 
peace in the interest of the region and the world at large. 
  It is necessary to note here that the international 
community's position, which has not thus far been firm enough, 
has encouraged Israel to hold the peace process in disregard. 
As for the Israeli evasion, it has produced flawed and partial 
solutions, which run counter to the just and comprehensive peace 
that is required. By contrast, the international community has 
seen Arab Syria augmenting its desire for just peace with a 
clear and strong position grounded in adherence to Arab rights, 
which are at the heart of just peace, taking care to safeguard 
the peace process. This has frustrated Israel's goal of 
thwarting the peace process. 
  The world community has praised this Syrian position, as 
demonstrated at the Geneva summit between His Excellency 
President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. For 
the U.S. President declared that peace must be comprehensive, 
noting that Syria holds the key to peace, and that there can be 
no peace without Syria. 
  Throughout the peace talks, the world community has seen a 
Syrian Arab eagerness to safeguard the peace process. Likewise, 
it has also seen a firm Syrian Arab position, as manifested in 
the working paper Syria submitted to the Israeli negotiators at 
one of the rounds of Washington bilateral talks. 
  There is no denying that there are many things Israel can 
do. 
Nonetheless, there are two things Israel can do nothing about. 
First, Israel cannot undermine Syria's firm and noble quest for 
just and comprehensive peace, which must be grounded in complete 
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon, and the 
occupied Arab territories, for this quest is attested to by the 
world public. Second, Israel cannot weaken the firm Syrian Arab 
position, which is, indeed, the position of all Arabs. This is 
a fact that is widely known to all those engaged in peace 
efforts, headed by the cosponsors of the peace process.

  [Text] London, June 29, IRNA -- A second Saudi Arabian 
diplomat working in the United States is considering to apply 
for political asylum, according to a faxed statement from his 
lawyer in London. 
  Ahmad al-Zahrani was said to be seeking refuge in the 
British 
capital after defecting from his post as second secretary at the 
Saudi Consulate in Houston. 
  His solicitor, Amjad Salfiti, said the 34-year old diplomat 
did not want to confuse his case with the former first secretary 
to the United Nations, Mohammad al-Khilewi, who applied for 
asylum in the U.S. earlier this month. 
  He suggested that his client's application would present a 
challenge to the British authorities to show an "even hand when 
dealing with matters involving serious breaches of human rights 
in a friendly country such as Saudi Arabia." 
  In his statement, al-Zahrani said that he was joining his 
voice to the "increasing number of moderate academics" from 
Saudi Arabia, who no longer are able to tolerate the breaches of 
basic human rights by the present regime in Riyadh. 
  His personal experience was supported by documentary 
evidence 
to prove "beyond any doubt the hypocrisy and double standards 
which are adopted by the Saudi regime," he said. 
  Al-Zahrani is noted for as a research writer of a book about 
Saudi politics, which he says has been prevented from being 
published even though he had obtained all the necessary licences. 
  There was no immediate indication if the diplomat would be 
joining the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights in 
Saudi Arabia (CDLR), which moved its office to London in April 
this year after having many of its members arrested inside the 
country. 
  The committee, which is becoming the main focal point for 
academics and intellectuals opposed to the Saudi Government, was 
approached by al-Khilewi, when he defected at the beginning of 
June and suggested other diplomats would follow.

<F P=106> [Editorial: "The Kingdom and Yemen's Interests"] </F>
  [Text] The claims that the kingdom is taking a biased stand 
toward the Yemen war are both baseless and unjustifiable. For 
the Kingdom's Yemen policy, as attested to by the Yemeni people, 
has always sought to promote the lot of the Yemeni people, and 
to boost their abilities through the huge financial assistance 
granted to Yemen. This assistance was used to finance 
development projects that were instrumental in making the 
qualitative leap forward seen in the areas of education, health, 
road construction, and other vital sectors in Yemen. The 
Kingdom made undeniable contributions to this commendable 
cultural leap forward. 
  It is not peculiar for the Kingdom, given its huge economic 
prowess, to assist its brothers in Yemen. For, it has always 
been known for aiding Arabs and Muslims whenever it could. This 
is the reflection of a policy espoused since the unification of 
the Kingdom. This policy is still in force. The kingdom has 
not sought to take advantage of all the wealth and resources 
bestowed upon it by God to the exclusion of others. It has 
always extended a helping hand to fellow Arabs and Muslims in 
pursuit of this sound policy and its spirit, which is derived 
from the injunctions of the tolerant Islamic religion and its 
sublime heavenly ideals. 
  Given all this, it is strange to see the northerners claim 
that the kingdom's position on Yemeni developments harms the 
interests of the Yemeni people, and that the kingdom is involved 
in the ongoing conflict between Sanaa and Aden when they are 
well aware that the Kingdom stressed the need to heed reason and 
halt the war between the two warring sides to protect Yemen's 
interests and end the bloodletting there even before the passage 
of the UN cease-fire resolution. The northerners are also aware 
that the Kingdom was one of the first countries to have blessed 
Yemeni unity when it was established by agreement between the 
two parts of Yemen four years ago. The Kingdom did so because 
it has always been interested in promoting the interests of 
Yemen and the prosperity of its people. 
  What is going on in fraternal Yemen nowadays can in no way 
promote the interests of the people in the two parts of Yemen. 
This is because war produces disastrous consequences. The 
continuation of the war in Yemen will produce devastation there. 
This will destroy the economic infrastructures built there, 
thanks to the contributions made by the Kingdom to promote the 
Yemenis' interests and bring about their prosperity. War could 
only produce further ruination, destruction, and devastation for 
both parts of Yemen. That is why the Kingdom hastened to support 
the UN cease-fire resolution. The kingdom wants an end to the 
heinous massacres to which the cities of southern Yemen are 
being exposed, because they have opposed a unity meant to be 
built on the dead bodies of the Yemeni people. 
  The Kingdom cannot take the blame for the mistakes Sanaa has 
made--mistakes that have exacerbated and complicated the 
political crisis in Yemen and caused it to flare up in a 
military confrontation with the south. The Kingdom's political 
constants cannot allow for intervention in Yemen's domestic 
affairs. Nonetheless, the Kingdom is interested in helping the 
Yemeni people overcome their current ordeal. Hence, its support 
for the UN cease-fire resolution. Additionally, the Kingdom is 
willing to help any Arab or Islamic efforts that could help to 
settle the ongoing conflict in a manner that would halt the 
bloodletting in Yemen and place Yemeni interests above all 
considerations. 
  Given all this, the Kingdom rejects the baseless allegations 
that it is involved in the ongoing conflict between north Yemen 
and south Yemen. At the same time, the Kingdom would like to 
reiterate that it is determined to work to safeguard the 
interests of the fraternal Yemeni people. It goes without 
saying that the Yemeni people's interests are not promoted when 
Sanaa violates the UN Security Council cease-fire resolution. 
Likewise, their interests are not served when Sanaa sticks to 
a unity that is opposed by the southerners. This is because 
unity cannot be built by the force of arms. Similarly, the 
interests of the Yemeni people are not served when this war 
continues to kill scores of innocent children, women, and 
elderly in Aden, and to destroy vital economic installations 
just to realize transient selfish interests.

  [Text] London, June 28, SPA -- The United Arab Emirates 
(UAE) has reiterated its inalienable stand from the problem of 
the three islands occupied by Iran. 
  In a statement published by London-based AL-WASAT magazine, 
carried yesterday by the UAE's news agency, UAE's Minister of 
state for foreign affairs Hamdan Bin-Zayid Al Nuhayyan said his 
country, along with the other GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] 
member states, would remain keen on establishing good relations 
with Iran. 
  But it will never accept the policy of threats and 
occupation, he said. 
  As the UAE will never give up even one span of its 
territories, then the problem of the three islands will 
constitute an obstacle before normalizing relations with Iran, 
he said. 
  If the Iranians have the historical documents which prove 
their ownership of the three islands, then they should present 
them before the international justice court, he said and added 
'we will accept the verdict issued by the international court'. 
  Al Nuhayyan pointed out that refusal of Iran to arbitration 
would mean that it has no sovereignty on the three islands. 
  On the problem of Yemen, Al Nuhayyan said his country does 
not support any of the conflicting parties in Yemen. 
  He noted that the UAE had mediated to settle the Yemeni 
dispute before the break-out of the war between Sanaa and Aden. 
  We have shown our keenness on Yemeni unity, but we believe 
that this unity should not come by means of force, he said 
highlighting the assistance extended by the UAE to Yemen before 
the announcement of the unity. 
  Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the president of the 
UAE, has made it clear to the Yemeni leaders that unity cannot 
be imposed by force, he said.

<F P=106> [Report by Shafiq al-Asadi: "Abu-Dhabi Rejects the Logic of </F>
Occupation by the Zionists or Iran"] 
  [Excerpts] Abu-Dhabi -- The United Arab Emirates [UAE] has 
reaffirmed its insistence on full sovereignty over the islands 
of Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu-Musa, and emphasized 
that it will not forfeit a single inch of their territory. 
  Diplomatic sources in Abu-Dhabi have stated that "this is a 
firm and irrevocable position regardless of the statements and 
threats of Iranian officials which are not based on any legal or 
historical ground relating to these islands which were forcibly 
occupied by Iran in 1971." 
  They added that "the statements of Iranian officials on the 
islands and Tehran's talk of eternal sovereignty over the three 
strategic Gulf islands reflect a conceited and arrogant Iranian 
mentality and Iranian policy toward the neighboring states, 
governed by upstaging and charges of treason, hegemony, and 
service to Zionism which Tehran knowns well. [no closing 
quotemark as published] 
  The sources were commenting on the statement of the Iranian 
Foreign Ministry's spokesman who said that the UAE's position 
"opens the way to Zionist hegemony." 
  The sources described the statement of Mahmud Mohammadi, the 
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, and his reaffirmation of 
"Iran's eternal sovereignty over the three strategic islands in 
the Gulf," as a "violation of the spirit of the era and of the 
international will that disputes should be settled by peaceful 
means and recourse to the international community if 
negotiations between the two sides fail." [passage omitted] 
  The sources said that "Iran's continued occupation of the 
islands reflects a mentality of hegemony. The logic of 
occupation is rejected, be it in Palestine by the Zionists or in 
the Gulf by the Iranians." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] Abu Dhabi -- Border and coast guard forces in 
the United Arab Emirates [UAE] have seized a boat carrying 
Iranian infiltrators who were trying to anchor off the UAE coast 
in the emirate of Umm al-Qaywayn, at a time when the UAE is 
taking decisive measures to foil infiltration operations and 
tackle the imbalance in the population structure. 
  A spokesman for the border guard forces confirmed that the

after a chase in the Gulf in which Interior Ministry helicopters 
took part. 
  The spokesman said that none of the infiltrators was hurt, 
the boat has been handed over to border guard forces, and the 
infiltrators have been referred to the judiciary for legal 
proceedings to be taken against them. 
  The UAE is currently taking tough measures to foil 
infiltration incidents conducted by various types of boats which 
anchor off its coasts along the Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. 
[passage omitted] 
  The UAE Interior Ministry said in a statement distributed 
yesterday that border and coast guard forces, supported by 
police helicopters, foiled an attempt to infiltrate into the UAE 
by a speedboat which was trying to anchor off the coast of Umm 
al-Qaywayn. 
  The statement said the boat was fired on but no one was 
hurt, 
and the boat was seized and all the people on board were 
arrested. [passage omitted]

  [Text] Aden, 29 June -- Abd al-Rahman al-Jifri, 
vice-chairman of the Presidential Council in the self-declared 
Democratic Republic of Yemen, denied reports by some news 
agencies that President Salim al-Bid had escaped from al-Mukalla 
to a neighboring country. 
  In an exclusive statement to the Kuwaiti news agency, KUNA, 
al-Jifri said such allegations confirmed that the regime of 
Sanaa had failed politically. He said he had just had a phone 
conversation with President al-Bid who was still in Hadramawt. 
  Regarding the situation on the fronts, al-Jifri said the 
southern forces have repelled northern troops who had been 
trying to draw close to Aden this evening. 
  He added he had confirmed information that the southern 
troops stationed on the Lahj front destroyed three (Doshka) 
artillery sets, seized 16 other artillery sets, and took 80 
northern soldiers prisoner. 
  KUNA's correspondent in Aden, confirmed that the northern 
shelling of Aden is still in progress and has reached areas 
close to the Aden hotel. 
  There has been no military communique on the extent of the 
damages caused by this shelling.

<F P=106> [Report by Raghidah Dirgham, Randah Taqiyy-al-Din, Faysal </F>
Makram, and Iqbal 'Abdallah: "Al-'Attas and al-Iryani Met, `Did 
Not Fail'"] 
  [Excerpt] New York, Paris, Sanaa, Aden -- While the siege 
of Aden -- whose residents are living without water and 
electricity in conditions described by citizens contacted by 
AL-HAYAH as worse than those they experienced during the 13 
January 1986 incidents -- has intensified, a meeting -- the 
first of its kind at this level since the war broke out -- was 
held in New York between a northern official and a southern 
official. The north was represented at the meeting, arranged by 
the UN secretary general's special envoy to Yemen Lakhdar 
Brahimi, by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and 
development minister in the Republic of Yemen, while the south 
was represented by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime 
minister of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen." 
  Al-Iryani and al-'Attas stressed to AL-HAYAH the importance 
of the meeting. Al-'Attas said that the meeting with al-Iryani 
and Brahimi "will [as published] be limited to discussing the 
cease-fire question, the mechanism of observing the 
implementation of the cease-fire, disengaging the forces, and 
determining a venue and a date for the negotiations." 
  Al-'Attas described the meeting as "a start," saying it 
represents "a first step." He added: "But my conclusion is 
also that the brothers in Sanaa are procrastinating in order to 
waste time at the Security Council." Al-'Attas did not rule out 
another meeting with al-Iryani, saying that this depends on 
Brahimi's "efforts." 
  He stressed that the meeting "discussed the cease-fire issue 
and a monitoring mechanism to consolidate it." He also said: 
"We could not complete" the discussions because "Dr. al-Iryani 
says he is not authorized to discuss details" of the points 
concerning "setting a time for the cease-fire, the observers 
team, and the monitoring mechanism." Al-'Attas was eager not to 
describe the meeting as a failure, emphasizing that it is 
regarded as "a start." 
  Dr. al-Iryani said that the meeting with al-'Attas and 
Brahimi "was not a failure. However, I say that there is an 
attempt to exploit legitimate actions for illegitimate ends." 
  He denied that he said at the meeting that he is not 
authorized to discuss a cease-fire mechanism. He said: "Of 
course I am authorized to discuss the cease-fire mechanism, and 
this is what we discussed. We agreed on the general aspects but 
disagreed over some details." He went on: "As for the question 
of setting a new time for the cease-fire, I do not have the 
authority. It is to be decided by Sanaa and field commanders." 
He disclosed that Brahimi asked him during the meeting to set a 
new time for the cease-fire, but al-Iryani told him that he 
would inform Sanaa that a new time is required. However, he 
added, "it was I who requested monitoring to determine who is 
violating the cease-fire. I requested that the monitoring 
process be supervised by the French and U.S. military attaches, 
and Haydar (al-'Attas) proposed the inclusion of the Russian 
attache. I said I would convey this proposal to Sanaa." 
  Al-Iryani stressed that holding another meeting with 
al-'Attas "is left" to Brahimi. He said that he is, "of course, 
authorized to discuss the Security Council resolution." As for 
setting a new time for the cease-fire, it is up to Sanaa, "and 
what is required is to halt the war machine." [passage omitted]

  [Excerpts] [passage omitted] 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, the 
Yemeni minister of planning and development, has told Radio 
Monte Carlo that during his meeting at the United Nations with 
the Aden representative, Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, both men 
agreed on a mechanism to deploy observers under the supervision 
of the UN envoy [Lakhdar Brahimi]. He added that discussion was 
still continuing regarding Arab and non-Arab states that might 
contribute to these observers. 
  The states that might participate in this effort include 
Morocco, Oman, Egypt, Jordan, India, Nigeria, and Senegal. 
[passage omitted] 
  Al-Iryani said that the UN secretary general will establish 
a 
special fund to which some member states will contribute to 
finance the observers whose number is not expected to exceed 
150. Al-Iryani added that his government will try to reach a 
temporary emergency cease-fire for two days as a test of good 
intentions and to give the International Committee of the Red 
Cross an opportunity to bring a ship from Djibouti to Aden and 
to send a land convoy to evacuate the wounded and extend 
humanitarian and medical assistance. He also said that if the 
cease-fire continues, the U.S., Russian, and French military 
attaches in Sanaa will monitor the cease-fire before the 
international observers are deployed. 
  Al-Iryani said that after the cease-fire has been 
consolidated, Lakhdar Brahimi will ask the two sides to resume 
the political dialogue adding that the dialogue may be held 
either in Jeddah, Cairo, or in Paris, which is Brahimi's 
headquarters.

<F P=106> [Interview with Salim Salih Muhammad, "head of the southern </F>
delegation to Cairo talks and member of the Yemeni Presidential 
Council," conducted in Cairo by Sumayyah Ahmad -- date not given] 
  [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ahmad] Now that Lakhdar 
Brahimi has concluded his tour, which aimed at resolving the 
Yemeni crisis, do you expect any new Security Council 
resolutions? Are you moving in this direction? 
  [Muhammad] We feel that Sanaa has wasted the time of the UN 
envoy and made Lakhdar Brahimi believe that it will accept a 
cease-fire and respond to his efforts. The UN envoy, who became 
certain that Sanaa continuously lies, will submit his report to 
the UN secretary general. We are waiting for the Security 
Council to take deterrent measures against those refusing to 
implement its resolutions. We are not only exerting efforts 
with our brothers in the Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula, but 
also with all Arab brothers and countries in the world to make 
them recognize the old situation and the old entity. The 
four-year old unity failed to merge it [with northern Yemen]. 
All merging efforts have failed. This requires new 
acknowledgement of the existing situation -- North and South. 
  [Ahmad] There were Egyptian-Emirian and Saudi initiatives to 
contain the Yemeni crisis from the beginning. What is your 
assessment of these initiatives and of the statement issued by 
the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] regarding the crisis? 
  [Muhammad] We welcomed all these mediations before and 
during 
the war and interacted with them out of our desire to save Yemen 
from the military option. However, Sanaa did not respond to 
these Egyptian and Gulf initiatives and efforts and refused to 
deal with them. Therefore, we expect our Arab brothers to 
support the victim of injustice. God willing, we will see this 
coming. Regarding the GCC statement, the brothers tried their 
best to stick to reason and dialogue. Sanaa, however, ignored 
all this. 
  We, on our part, ask the brothers in the Gulf states, and in 
the Arab states in general, to recognize us expeditiously 
regardless of the military situation, because we are the owners 
of rights and cause. We have a right to make our own decisions 
and refuse to see tanks, a tribal chieftain, or al-Zindani 
[member of the Yemeni Presidential Council] deciding our fate. 
  [Ahmad] Has the military situation, which is almost settled 
in favor of the North, affected Arab and international 
recognition of Yemen? 
  [Muhammad] Undoubtedly, this is true. Even if we move to 
Socotra Island we will never give up. We will continue 
resistance regardless of the military situation in any 
governorate. The situation on the ground is not very bad. 
Sanaa's attempts to end the war in three days failed and the 
war has been going for more than six weeks. We will continue 
resistance and make others admit the realities on the ground. 
  [Ahmad] How do you view the American stand, and the western 
stand in general, vis-a-vis the crisis? 
  [Muhammad] The U.S. stand is in harmony with its steps. 
Certainly, the coming days will reveal the exemplary end of this 
role, because we are certain that the Americans, Europeans, and 
the Arab brothers cannot allow a small Saddam to appear south of 
the Arabian Peninsula. 
  [Ahmad] What is your assessment of the Egyptian stand 
vis-a-vis the Yemeni crisis? 
  [Muhammad] Egypt is concerned about the situation in Yemen 
on 
the historical, geographical, political, security, and military 
levels. Therefore, it must have a role in the crisis. I 
believe there is an Egyptian role, but it takes into 
consideration certain internal and external factors. Egypt is 
dealing with the situation in a mature and wise way. However, 
we feel that the situation in Yemen is serious, and I do not 
believe that Egypt will accept a fundamentalist government in 
Yemen or want to see Bab el Mandeb and the Red Sea under the 
control of two fundamentalist states (Yemen and Sudan). I 
believe Egypt is aware of this. Hence, we depend on the 
Egyptian role and warn of the dangers of what is taking place in 
Yemen. This is despite the fact that we are victims of studying 
the situation thoroughly.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
Presidential Council chairman and supreme commander of the Armed 
Forces, has emphasized that the Republic of Yemen will deal 
positively with any international proposal that is in interest 
of the Yemeni people and that serves the higher national 
interest. 
  He said: Our forces -- the forces of legitimacy -- have 
restored more than 70 percent of the areas that had been 
controlled by the secessionists. He said that the forces of 
legitimacy are now at the entrances of Hadramaut, and are in 
control of more than 55 percent of city of Aden. 
  The brother president emphasized our Yemeni people's 
rejection of those secessionists and agents who betrayed their 
people and sold the homeland's cause at a low price. 
  He called on some brotherly countries, which claim to be 
really eager to save Yemeni blood, to stop interfering in our 
internal affairs and not to support the rebels. 
  The brother president hailed the position of the fraternal 
State of Qatar -- government and people -- which advocates 
Yemeni unity, and the Qatari leadership's sympathy with, and 
support for legitimacy and Yemeni people. 
  He said this in a (television interview?) with the Qatari 
television team.

  [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, 
chairman of the Presidential Council, received today brother 
Badr Hammam, assistant to the foreign minister of fraternal 
Egypt, who conveyed a message to the brother president from his 
brother Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak. The message 
deals with developments in our country, as well as issues of 
interest to the brotherly relations between the two countries. 
  The message stresses Egypt's firm position and support for 
Yemeni unity, cease-fire efforts, and dialogue within the 
framework of unity as the best way to settle the current 
differences. It also asserts that Egypt is with unity, with the 
people, and with stability in the Republic of Yemen. 
  The Presidential Council chairman voiced his satisfaction 
with and great appreciation for the position of the brothers in 
Egypt, headed by His Excellency President Muhammad Husni 
Mubarak. He referred to the special Yemeni-Egyptian relations 
and the profound and strong ties between the two fraternal 
countries. He also said that Egypt's support for the Yemeni 
people and their unity is part of its honorable pan-Arab role 
[words indistinct] in support of the eternal Yemeni revolution.

  [Text] Sanaa, 29 Jun (INA) -- President 'Ali 'Abdallah 
Salih today issued a decree naming Mr. Taha Ahmad Ghanim new 
governor for Aden. He replaces Salih Munassar al-Siyayli, one 
of the secessionist leaders. 
  It is to be recalled that, except for Crater, al-Mu'alla, 
and 
al-Tawahi, where the secessionists are entrenched, the Yemeni 
legitimate forces are now in control of all of Aden's suburbs.

  [Text] Cairo, 29 Jun (MENA) -- Nine Yemeni leaders called 
today for an immediate cease-fire in Yemen and a quick return to 
negotiations in order to allow all efforts to bear fruit, stop 
the shedding of the Yemeni people's blood, protect Yemen's unity 
and territorial integrity, and halt the bleeding of human 
resources. 
  In a faxed statement received by MENA's main office, the 
nine 
leaders called on the two sides to resort to reason so as to end 
the suffering of the Yemenis, to stop the destruction of the 
homeland's resources and capabilities, and to allow peace to 
prevail all over Yemen's territories and thus thwart all the 
attempts to deepen the tragedy. 
  The nine leaders are: Ahmad Muhammad Nu'man, Jarallah 'Umar, 
'Ali Nasir Muhammad, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Ruba'i, Sinan 
Abu- Lahm, Muhammad 'Abd-al-Quddus [word indistinct], Mujahid 
[word indistinct], Muhammad 'Abd-al-Malik al-Mutawakkil, and

<F P=106> [Report by Mahir Shmaytilli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Northern forces 
battled their way to within two kilometres (a mile) of the 
besieged city of Aden Thursday [30 June], as three civilians 
were killed and eight wounded queuing for water during the night. 
  Military officials said northern troops loyal to President 
'Ali 'Abdallah Salih were just outside the suburb of Dar Sa'd on 
Thursday morning after heavy fighting overnight. 
  Dar Sa'd is virtually deserted as residents have fled the 
suburb in recent days after it suffered sustained shelling and 
rocket fire. 
  Hospital officials said the three civilians were killed as 
they queued during the night at one of the city's wells in the 
western suburb of Mansurah. 
  Northern forces were also within five kilometers of 
Mansurah, 
according to southern officials loyal to Salih's former vice 
president and southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  But in Moscow the two sides were said to be close to signing 
a ceasefire later Thursday after talks with Russian Foreign 
Minister Andrei Kozyrev, the ITAR-TASS agency reported. 
  The news came only hours after the UN Security Council 
adopted a second resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire 
and the start of talks. 
  After the vote, UN officials said a southern Yemen 
representative pledged that Aden would observe a 48-hour 
ceasefire starting Thursday to allow the delivery of relief 
supplies. 
  Two explosions rocked the city early Thursday, causing 
casualties, officials at the Al-Jumhuriyah hospital said, 
without giving details. 
  More than 424 civilians have been killed and 1,170 wounded 
since the north began its assault on the city on June 11. 
  Northern warplanes and artillery pounded the port on 
Wednesday in a day of intense bombardments which killed 20 
civilians and wounded 96. 
  Humanitarian workers have warned that Aden is on the edge of 
a "catastrophe" stripped of water and fuel supplies. 
  Northern troops have cut off the south's access to its oil 
refinery, destroyed the water pumping station and intense 
battles have raged at Hiswah, 10 kilometres (six miles) from the 
city where Aden's main power station is based. 
  Southern forces have dug in on the edge of Aden erecting 
sand 
barriers and hollowing out trenches to repel the north's advance. 
  The Security Council also authorized Secretary General 
Butrus 
Butrus-Ghali to study ways to supervise a ceasefire at its 
meeting in UN headquarters in New York. 
  The resolution also denounced the civilian casualties and 
destruction resulting from the assault on Aden, in what was seen 
as a condemnation of northern Yemen. 
  But US Ambassador Madeleine Albright said after the vote 
that 
any ceasefire mechanism should be handled by neighboring states 
for financial and other reasons. 
  Kozyrev held a series of private and joint meetings 
Wednesday 
with Yemen Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah and Salim Salih 
Muhammad, a representative from the breakaway Democratic 
Republic of Yemen. 
  ITAR-TASS said some technical details still remained to be 
resolved but described the accord as an "important step" towards 
resolving the conflict on the Arabian peninsula. 
  For nearly 25 years, prior to the reunification of North and 
South Yemen in 1990, South Yemen was an ally of the former 
Soviet Union. 
  War broke out on May 5 and al-Bid declared a separate state 
two weeks later, shattering a fragile four-year union between 
the former Marxist South Yemen and conservative tribal North 
Yemen.

<F P=106> [By Mahir Chmaytilli] </F>
  [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 30 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni forces 
have been hampered by internal dissension and a lack of manpower 
as they struggle to thwart a northern advance along about 100 
kilometres (60 miles) of frontline around the port city of Aden. 
  Three northern tanks slipped through into the undefended 
western suburb of Madinat al-Sha'b on Saturday [25 June], the 
office of the south's appointed vice-president 'Abd-al-Rahman 
al-Jifri said. 
  Initially they met no resistance, giving northern forces 
enough time to consolidate their forces and cut off Aden from 
its oil refinery 18 kilometres (11 miles) to the west along the 
coast road. 
  Southern forces swiftly hurled their men towards the area in 
a bid to recapture the route to the refinery which supplies 
their troops with fuel. 
  But the north had the advantage of surprise and, turning the 
tables, launched another offensive to the north. 
  By Tuesday they had advanced as far as the city's pumping 
station about 15 kilometres (nine miles) north of the city. 
  Aden was thus effectively cut off from vital fuel and water 
supplies. 
  Southern officers collectively attribute the northern push 
to 
a lack of manpower among the soldiers loyal to southern leader 
'Ali Salim al-Bid. 
  They point out that the south, which declared independence 
on 
May 21, has just three million people, compared with the north's 
population of 11 million. 
  In a bid to make up the numbers, a general call-up has been 
announced and buses tour the city collecting young men to take 
them to the front. 
  Since the war broke out on May 5 the south has been further 
handicapped by dissension among its own ranks. 
  A member of the southern presidential council, Sulayman 
Nasir 
Mas'ud, has accused soldiers loyal to the former president of 
South Yemen 'Ali Nasir Muhammad of backing the north in Abyan 
province east of Aden. 
  Muhammad, who came from Abyan, was toppled by al-Bid in a 
bloody power struggle in Aden in 1986, before the former 
conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South in May 
1990. 
  Al-Jifri accused units loyal to the former president 
deployed 
in the north of "treason," saying they had lent their weight to 
al- Bid's rival, President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a northerner. 
  The units knew the layout of the terrain in the south. 
  The south's setbacks can also be explained by the loss of 
three of their best units. They were attacked and knocked out 
of action even before the war broke out. 
  The south had tried to withdraw the units, deployed in the 
northern areas of Dhamar, 'Amran and Yarim, but the move had 
been fiercely opposed by Salih. 
  Southern leaders are also trying to combat Moslem 
fundamentalists allied to Salih. 
  About 3,000 of them are said to be hiding out in and around 
Aden, according to informed sources. 
  Southern officers have already blamed them for the fall of 
several key points, including the town of Lahij, about 30 
kilometres (18 miles) north of Aden, seized by the north three 
weeks ago. 
  Roadblocks crisscross Aden, barring the entrance to every 
district as searches go on for the Islamic militants. 
  Women militia are among 30,000 members of the Yemen 
Socialist 
Party (YSP) deployed in the city to stop any insurrection. The 
women's job is to search women wearing the Moslem veil. 
  Northern Foreign Minister Muhammad Basindwah has said the 
north's troops "are inside Aden itself," and Sanaa is counting 
on the population to rise up and seize the city.

  [Text] An official source has denied that the forces of 
unity protecting constitutional legitimacy are shelling 
residential quarters in Aden. It is a sacred duty for these 
forces to protect citizens, guarantee their security, and 
preserve the country's stability. It is the gang of rebellion 
and secession who is carrying out such treacherous acts of 
hostility. They sold themselves, their consciences, and their 
minds to the devil, imagining that this would help them 
internationalize the Yemeni issue and promote it in foreign 
media and in public opinion. Therefore, they attribute these 
ugly criminal acts to the forces protecting and national 
achievements and the people, foremost of which are unity, 
democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. 
  The source said the gang, which is committing crimes against 
the people and the homeland, has won nothing internally but the 
rejection and hatred of all Yemeni people throughout the 
country. These criminal acts will never achieve their 
illegitimate and unpatriotic objectives. They will backfire on 
the perpetrators, bringing just and deterring punishment. 
  The source said that cease-fire initiatives and the 
political 
leadership's efforts to entrench them and the state's 
constitutional authority are based on an ability to confront all 
acts of hostility and to state practically that the opportunity 
for dialogue has never been closed, in light of the principled 
and declared bases. Many opportunities have been provided for 
many of those who have been misled to speak and to define their 
positions bravely and to be confident that they will find in the 
ranks of unity and constitutional legitimacy all safety, 
protection, appreciation, respect, and understanding of all the 
pressure and the means of repression exercised by the rebels to 
draw them by force into the tunnel of disgrace and destruction. 
  The source said the rebels are stepping up their hostile, 
hysterical action against the places in which the forces of 
unity and constitutional legitimacy are located in the 
al-Huswah, al-Basatin, Shaykh 'Uthman, Madinat al-Sha'b, 
al-Mansurah, [?Amad al-Mindarah], [?'al-Kyus], Bi'r al-Nasirah, 
Bi'r Nasir, al-'Imad, and other places. They are fiercely 
shelling civilian and economic installations in Little Aden, 
believing they have no way to achieve their illegitimate 
objectives other than more destruction and the escalation of the 
death machine that engulfs them. The forces protecting unity 
and legitimacy are working to silence the rancorous military 
hotbeds that never responded to all the cease-fire initiatives. 
  The source emphasized that all Yemeni people are determined 
to stop the machine of destruction run by the rebels and to 
silence it forever so there will be no solutions except one 
based on understanding and dialogue, not on intransigence and 
the demented and rancorous use of the machine of destruction.

  [Text] Amman, 29 Jun (INA) -- 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur, 
member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, 
has relayed the greetings of His Excellency President Saddam 
Husayn to Jordanian parties and the fraternal Jordanian people. 
'Abd-al-Ghafur also told the Jordanian parties that his 
excellency the president takes pride in the noble pan-Arab stand 
they took during the great showdown of the legendary Mother of 
Battles. 
  This came during a meeting between 'Abd-al-Ghani 
'Abd-al-Ghafur and the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party delegation on 
the one hand, and the secretaries general of 11 Jordanian 
parties in Amman today. 
  During this meeting, 'Abd-al-Ghafur reviewed the latest 
developments in the relationship between Iraq and the UN 
Security Council, as well as the efforts under way to lift the 
unfair sanctions clamped on Iraq. He indicated that the 
positive changes in the stands of most members of the UN 
Security Council are to be attributed to the steadfastness of 
the Iraqi people, and the wisdom of their leader Saddam Husayn. 
  'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur urged nationalist, pan-Arab, 
and 
Islamic forces in Jordan and the Arab homeland to step up their 
efforts and activities prior to the next periodic review session 
of the UN Security Council in July. 
  During the meeting, the Ba'th Party delegation made some 
practical proposals regarding multifaceted moves that could be 
made on the pan-Arab and international scenes to expedite the 
lifting of the unfair sanctions and mitigate the sufferings of 
the steadfast Iraqi people. 
  For their part, the secretaries general of the Jordanian 
parties reiterated their total support for Iraq. They also 
commended its steadfastness in the face of the unfair embargo, 
as well as its legendary confrontation of all forms of 
aggression, conspiracies, and foreign intervention in its 
domestic affairs. 
  The Jordanian parties also renewed their full support for 
Iraq's unity, independence, and sovereignty, particularly since 
the battle it is waging is meant to vindicate Arabism and Islam. 
The enemy in this battle is one; namely, U.S. imperialism, and 
its ally, racist and expansionist Zionism, the Jordanian parties 
contended. 
  The conferees agreed to form a committee to draft practical 
proposals for future action on the Jordanian, Arab, and 
international scenes. 
  The meeting was attended by 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Hashimi, 
director of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the Iraq Command of 
the Ba'th Party; Sa'd Qasim Hammudi, secretary general of the 
Arab Popular Forces Conference; and the Iraqi ambassador in 
Amman.

  [Excerpt] Interior Minister Salamah Hammad has emphasized 
that the security situation in Jordan is very good, and said 
there is not even one political prisoner. 
  In a news conference at the Interior Ministry today, the 
interior minister added that the allegations that prisons are 
full of detainees are baseless. Only those who committed 
criminal actions are in prison, and no prisoner is detained 
without a decision by the general prosecutor. 
  He said public liberties in Jordan are preserved in a 
democratic atmosphere that is unique in the region. 
  Hammad said that detention measures, including those who 
committed the crimes of explosions in public places, have been 
carried out in accordance with the law and within the framework 
of legal procedures. [passage omitted]

  [Text] While Minister of Tourism Muhammad 'Adwan believes 
that having any kind of contact over tourism with Israel at this 
stage is "premature" businesspeople in the trade think otherwise. 
  "We have to deal with matters in an open-minded and 
pragmatic 
manner," says Muhammad Imam, general manager of International 
Tourist Travel Services, adding that in view of the tangible 
progress on the Jordanian-Israeli peace track, Jordanian travel 
and tourist agents have to start communicating with the Israelis 
to prepare for any future bilateral agreement on tourism in the 
region. 
  Mr. Imam adds that "we should not act like ostriches and 
hide 
away from reality." The reality, according to him, is that 
Jordan's tourism cannot survive without coordination with 
Israel, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon and the Palestinians. 
  Dr. 'Adwan maintains that matters concerning tourism in the 
region will only be discussed in current peace negotiations. 
  While informed sources in the tourism business told the 
JORDAN TIMES that Jordan was represented in a tourism conference 
in Tel Aviv on June 13, Dr. 'Adwan said that he "had no 
knowledge of it, has not been consulted (on the issue), and 
therefore, (he) can deny it." 
  The Israeli daily newspaper, HA'ARETZ, said last week that 
five Jordanian businessmen were scheduled to attend the 
conference for which "Jewish businessmen were queueing." 
  The tourism business sources, who asked not to be named, 
said 
that there was no harm in participating in such "friendly and 
beneficial" conferences to hear the "other point of view." 
  Mr. Imam said that since "we sat with the Israelis in 
Madrid, 
Washington and will be doing so in Aqaba next month, it is no 
big deal to meet with them in the occupied territories for 
business pruposes." 
  He said he believed preparations should start by providing 
the "proper" infrastructure for tourism-related projects in 
Petra, the Kingdom's main attraction, and by establishing other 
bridges linking both the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel 
to Jordan. 
  "We want tourists coming from the Holy Land to come and stay 
and not just use Jordan for an excursion," said Mr. Imam.

  [Text] At the invitation of the Armed Forces, and in 
cooperation with the Information Ministry, a media team 
comprising representatives of the local media and newspapers 
yesterday started a two-day tour of the armistice line with 
Israel. The tour aims at briefing the media on the Israeli 
encroachments on Jordanian territory and waters in various areas 
along the armistice line, from al-Yarmuk River in the north to 
the Gulf of Aqaba in the south. 
  Our correspondent Jawad al-'Umari was part of the media team 
and will present us with the following report: 
  [Begin recording] [Al-'Umari] The media team set out 
yesterday from the Information Ministry to Ghawr al-Safi area, 
via al-Karak. In the Jordan Valley area, the team visited a 
Jordanian Armed Forces unit and was briefed by the head of the 
Operations Branch on the duties of the units and formations of 
the Southern Military Region, which extends from the southern 
part of the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba, and the projects 
executed by the Armed Forces in these areas, including schools, 
earth dams, and population surveys. The team was also briefed 
by the unit commander on the duties and tasks of his unit. 
  Throughout yesterday and last night, the media team visited 
a 
number of points opposite the occupied Jordanian lands and the 
waters that are being encroached upon in the Dead Sea and in 
water basins. They saw from a distance the position of the 
Jordanian borders before the repeated Israeli attacks, which 
started in 1952. 
  The media team stopped at the southern part of the Dead Sea, 
Ghawr Sifa, and al-Salmani Police Post area, to the west of 
which the major Israeli encroachment on Jordanian territory 
starts and extends south, for various distances, to the Gulf of 
Aqaba. The team also stopped at 'Ayn Hasab area, where the 
Israeli encroachments reach their maximum, up to 8 km inside the 
Jordanian territory. Israel utilized that area for agriculture. 
It also utilized the ground water reservoir by drilling 
artesian wells to irrigate crops. 
  The team also saw the Wadi al-Ghuwayb area, a tributary to 
the Wadi al-'Arabah resources and the 'Ayn Daha area, where the 
Israeli encroachment reaches between 5 to 6 km. Waters and 
lands in the area were also utilized for agriculture by Israel. 
  The team also visited al-Rishah area, the point of water 
distribution, that is, the highest point in Wadi al-'Arabah. 
Waters flow from that point to the Dead Sea in the north and to 
the Red Sea in the south. 
  In the Gharandal area, the media team visited a Southern 
Military Region unit. The unit commander gave a briefing on the 
area's nature and the battles that occurred there throughout 
history, as well as the battles fought by the Jordanian Armed 
Forces in defense of Palestine and Jordanian territory. The 
team also saw the remnants of some of the battles fought by the 
Armed Forces and the airfield in the area which was used by the 
British mandate forces during World War I. 
  The media team then left for the Gulf of Aqaba via the Qa'at 
Tabah area, which was proposed by Israel as the venue for 
negotiations on border demarcation. The media team was briefed 
by the commander of al-'Aqabah Military Region on the border 
dispute in that area and Israeli encroachments on Jordanian 
lands and waters, as specified by the Mandate Document in 1928. 
  During the tour, Brigadier General Mansur Abu-Rashid, head 
of 
the joint Jordanian truce committee, gave a detailed explanation 
of the Israeli encroachments inside Jordanian territory. Brig. 
Gen. Abu-Rashid spoke to our radio at the Gulf of Aqaba area: 
  [Brig. Gen Abu-Rashid] The encroachments start in the area 
south of the Dead Sea, al-Safi, and Sifa areas. These 
encroachments extended to the southern area. In Gharandal area 
there were encroachments. Let me say that along the borders 
down to the Red Sea, there were encroachments. Sometimes these 
encroachments are deep, and, at others there are encroachments 
inside only a few hundreds of meters from the international 
borders defined by the British Mandate Document, which 
stipulates that the middle of Wadi al-'Arabah is the 
international borderline between Palestine and Jordan in the 
mandate era. 
  [Al-'Umari] Dr. Mundhir Haddadin, member of the Jordanian 
delegation to the peace talks, head of the Jordanian team to the 
waters working group in the multilateral conference, and member 
of the tripartite economic committee, accompanied the media team 
on this tour. Dr. Haddadin spoke to our radio on the 
negotiating situation of Jordanian territory within the context 
of the Jordanian-Israeli track and the projects planned to be 
executed to develop the Jordan Valley region after reaching a 
just, lasting, and comprehensive peace. Dr. Haddadin said: 
  [Haddadin] Jordanian territory occupied by Israel in the 
southern area is about 360 square km in area. In the fifth 
clause of the joint agenda, which we reached with Israel in 
September 1993, the two parties agreed that borders between 
Israel and Jordan should be delineated on the basis of the 
borders stipulated by the document of British mandate over 
Palestine and Trans-Jordan in the early 1920's. [end recording]

  [Text] Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev's wife and young 
son received injuries of varying degrees of severity during the 
assassination attempt on the president on 28 May, according to a 
statement released by the Chechnya Foreign Ministry today. The 
Foreign Ministry assesses the act of terrorism, in which the 
republic's interior minister and his deputy were killed, as an 
attack on President Dudayev. The terrorists used a 
remote-control explosive device, which the Russian special 
services have at their disposal.

  [Excerpts] Groznyy, 28 May -- Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev described yesterday's terrorist act in the republic as 
carefully organized sabotage directed against independent 
Chechnya. He said on local television today that forces opposed 
to the slight thaw in Russo-Chechen relations were behind this 
act. 
  Some details about the terrorist act emerged today. There 
was a powerful explosion at about 2000 local time on 27 May on 
the road between the Chechen settlements of Zakan-Lirk and 
Alkha-Kala just as the president's motorcade was driving past a 
Zhiguli model nine parked at the edge of the road. [passage 
omitted] 
  Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the government of national 
confidence, also gave his opinion about the terrorist act today. 
In a statement he stressed that the process of the 
self-destruction of the Chechen people is becoming more 
profound. The government of national confidence resolutely 
condemns such actions, no matter by whom, and appeals to the 
leaders of the regime, to all sociopolitical forces and to the 
citizens of the republic for nationwide reconciliation and an 
end to all forms of confrontation.

  [Text] The Chechen leaders accused Moscow of elevating 
terrorism to the level of state policy, but stated that "under 
no circumstance will they resort to return measures." On 
Monday, the Chechen Foreign Ministry circulated a statement 
which lays the blame for such a policy on the Russian 
authorities. 
  The attempt on the life of President Dudayev on May 27 was 
merely the latest terrorist act carried out by the Russian 
special services over the three years since the Chechen state 
came into existence, says the statement. 
  A mine planted in a Zhiguli car on a road leading to Groznyy 
exploded last Friday when the motorcade with President Dudayev 
was passing by. The Chechen minister of the interior and his 
deputy, who were traveling with the president, were killed. 
President Dudayev was not hurt. 
  "Under the cover of democratic rhetoric, the Russian 
leadership is undermining the sovereignty of Chechnya," says 
this document. "All this is taking place amid reports about 
forthcoming talks between Boris Yeltsin and Dzhokhar Dudayev, 
although the Chechen leaders have not received any official 
proposals," says the statement. 
  The Chechen authorities believe that the actual plans of the 
Russian leaders boil down to "backstage contacts between 
Russia's high-ranking officials and dubious figures, who have 
compromised themselves by anti-democratic actions in the Chechen 
Republic," says the document.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Russian foreign intelligence 
has denied involvement in attack on Chechen President Dzhokhar 
Dudayev this past weekend. 
  Foreign intelligence spokeswoman Tatyana Samolis described 
as 
groundless a statement by head of the Chechen department of the 
press and information Movladi Udugov made in an interview with 
FRANCE PRESSE that "local experts made an attempt on Dzhokhar 
Dudayev's life on the order from (Russian foreign intelligence 
chief) Yevgeniy Primakov." 
  In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Monday, Samolis said that 
such allegations are a "fabrication bordering on nonsense and 
absurdity." She said the Russian foreign intelligence abandoned 
terroristic methods long ago and does not even have structures 
which could carry out such activity. 
  The foreign intelligence service only collects information, 
she said.

  [Text] Moscow, May 28 (AFP) -- Authorities imposed a 
one-month state of alert Saturday [28 May] over the breakaway 
Caucasus republic of Chechnya following an overnight failed 
assassination attempt against President Dzhokar Dudayev. 
  Dudayev emerged unhurt from a car-bomb attack near the 
capital Groznyy in which his interior minister and deputy as 
well as their driver were killed, a presidential spokesman said. 
Sunday was declared a day of mourning. 
  The cabinet of the Moslem republic, which has declared 
independence, met in emergency session after the attack to agree 
the curfew's imposition. 
  Spokesman Movladi Udugov said a remote-controlled 
booby-trapped Zhiguli car exploded as the president's motorcade 
was passing late Friday. 
  Dudayev's Interior Minister Magomet Eldiyev, his deputy 
Saidali Bateyev and their driver were killed, Udugov said. They 
were travelling in the first vehicle of the motorcade. Dudayev 
was in the second car, which was jolted by the blast. 
  It was not clear who carried out the attack. However, a 
spokesman for Dudayev, whilst not directly implicating Moscow, 
stressed an examination of debris from the attack showed the 
explosives used were "of the same kind as those used by the 
Russian secret service in operations of sabotage and terrorism." 
  But General Dudayev, who proclaimed Chechnya's independence 
in 1991, also faced internal opposition from several camps and 
observers believe one of his rivals could have carried out the 
bombing. 
  Tension between Groznyy and Moscow has run high since 
November 1991 when the tiny republic declared independence. 
  Dudayev was returning to the Chechen capital from his native 
village of Zakan-Yurt, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, when 
the bomb went off. 
  Two days earlier, Dudayev had put his armed forces on alert, 
warning of "an attempt by Moscow to expand the implementation of 
a state of emergency" along Chechnya's border with Ingushetia 
"in the regions of Sunzha and Malgobek." 
  Chechnya, where even basic products are in short supply, is 
a 
mafia hotbed. 
  Three months ago, key opposition member General Ibragim 
Suleimenov called for Dudayev's resignation and for "air strikes 
on the republic's installations." He was arrested and jailed 
two days later. 
  Dudayev refused to sign the Russian Federation Treaty and 
the 
republic boycotted Russian polls last December. Moscow 
responded with an economic blockade. 
  Dudayev also imposed a previous curfew after about 1,000 
armed opponents gathered in Groznyy's main square. Amid the 
continuing standoff with Moscow, Dudayev had periodically put 
the Chechen security forces on alert, a move he repeated on 
Thursday. 
  Despite the resumption of bilateral talks in March, 
Chechenya 
and Russia remain at odds, with Gronzy several times accusing 
Moscow's secret services of provocation. In March 1993, Chechen 
authorities said Russia masterminded the killing of two of 
Dudayev's advisors in London. One Armenian was eventually 
convicted of the killings.

  [Text] A senior official in the Chechen State Security 
Department said that Russian troops were on the move in areas 
bordering on Chechnya. 
  The department's deputy head Khamid Dzhalmaldayev said that, 
according to the Chechen general staff, a Su-27 attack plane 
unit had flown to the air base in Mozdok, North Ossetia. 
  He added that Russian Interior Ministry special troops whose 
fire power is equal to that of a wartime infantry division had 
moved into the Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia. 
  Dzhalmaldayev thought that these troop movement had to do 
with the latest events such as the attempt on Dzhokhar Dudayev's 
life and efforts mounted by the Russian special services to 
destabilize Chechnya. 
  Meanwhile, defense, interior and security chiefs told a 
conference chaired by Chechen President Dudayev that the 
situation in the republic was under control.

  [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Sergey 
Shakhray does not rule out that the president of Chechnya "can 
become a political leader who would normalize relations with the 
Russian Federation." Talking to newsmen, Shakhray did not name 
the dates of the meeting between the leaders of Russia and 
Chechnya, but noted that such a meeting should be prepared. 
  Taking part in an all-Russia Conference on Federalism and 
Interethnic Relations, Shakhray emphasised that relations with 
Chechnya will be regulated on a negotiatory basis with bodies of 
power and all political forces, and will include free and fair 
democratic elections in the republic as a legal way out of the 
political crisis." 
  Shakhray said that the State Duma had accepted the Russian 
president's logic and has reproduced it in a resolution. The 
government has been directed to hold consultations with 
Chechnya's power bodies and political forces. The object of the 
consultations will be the draft treaty on the delimitation of 
subjects of control and authority. The treaty will be signed 
under the condition that Chechnya holds the elections, the 
deputy emphasised. 
  There is no other way to "overcome the decision adopted by 
the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies on the illegality of 
elections in Chechnya," according to Sergey Shakhray. At the 
same time, he explained that at the present, no ultimatum is 
being issued as to when and under what conditions the elections 
are to be held.

  [Text] Vladikavkaz, 29 May -- The extension of the state of 
emergency in some areas of North Ossetia for another two months 
currently serves as a guarantee of the safety of the republic's 
citizens, North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov told 
ITAR-TASS today. He strongly rejected the idea of introducing 
federal government in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This will be, in his 
opinion, a deadlock that may cause a new tragedy in the North 
Caucasus. Galazov left for Moscow today to take part in a 
meeting of the Federation Council, which will consider the 
situation in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the 
extension of the state of emergency in some parts of North 
Ossetia and Ingushetia. 
  The president believes that peaceful negotiations should be 
the main thrust in settling relations between the peoples of 
North Ossetia and Ingushetia.

  [Text] Boris Yeltsin signed a decree today extending the 
state of emergency in the Ingush-Ossetian conflict zone to the 
Malgobekskiy and Sunzhenskiy Rayons of Ingushetia. This decree 
has to be approved by the Federation Council. It is worth 
mentioning that Boris Yeltsin's actions will provoke a strongly 
negative reaction in Groznyy. Here these rayons are considered 
to be historically Chechen lands. This is what (Mavlen 
Salimov), an aide to the president of Chechnya, said to Radio 
Ekho Moskvy about this: 
  [Begin Salimov recording] We consider that these actions are 
unlawful, and consider them as aggression, as an attempted act 
of aggression. [end recording] 
  [Announcer] Also today, a high-ranking official from the 
Chechen state security department told INTERFAX that Russian 
troops are being redeployed today on the border of the republic. 
Khamid Zhemoldayev, deputy head of the department, says that 
special units of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, equal 
to an army division, have arrived in Prigorodnyy Rayon of North 
Ossetia. 
  Also today, Chechen President Dudayev held an emergency 
meeting with power ministers.

  [Text] Groznyy, will react "extremely negatively" if the 
Russian authorities extend the state of emergency to part of 
Malgobek and Sunzhen Regions in Ingushetia, Chechnya's 
presidential structures told Interfax on Tuesday. An official 
reaction will follow as soon as the decree signed by the Russian 
president on this score is "studied carefully enough." 
  The decree signed by Boris Yeltsin on Monday provides for 
the 
imposition of a special regime virtually throughout Malgobek and 
Sunzhen Regions in Ingushetia. These regions are disputed by 
Chechnya and Ingushetia, and Groznyy, views them as inherently 
Chechen territories. 
  As Chechnya's Foreign Ministry told Interfax, Groznyy, will 
view the deployment of Russian troops in Malgobek Region as an 
"aggression by a foreign country." Chechnya's Foreign Minister, 
Shamseddin Yusef, told Interfax that "adequate measures will be 
taken to rebuff an aggression by Russian troops." 
  In the meantime Interfax learned from military sources in 
Groznyy that on Wednesday Chechnya's armed forces are beginning 
military exercises. The exercises are to take place in the 
"territories bordering on adjoining states." Last week 
Chechnya's troops went on high alert in connection with the 
possible imposition of a state of emergency in Malgobek and 
Sunzhen Regions of Ingushetia by Moscow.

  [Text] Ingush refugees will not be able to return to North 
Ossetia unless Ingushetia meets certain conditions, North 
Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov told Interfax in 
Vladikavkaz before flying to Moscow. 
  Galazov said that Ingushetia had to forego its claim on the 
Prigorodnyy District of North Ossetia and that the Ingush 
refugees had to understand they were North Ossetian citizens and 
were not allowed to sabotage the decisions of the local 
authorities. 
  He said it was important that the provisional administration 
let the local authorities organize the life of the North 
Ossetian population. 
  He believed that the use of force to return the refugees 
would result in an out-and-out civil war in the Caucusus which 
would spread to Russia proper.

<F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 21 of 71] </F>
  [Text] According to analysts, the treaty signed between the 
Russian federal government and Tatarstan on the separation of 
powers has not offered Tatarstan the expected economic 
prosperity. Moreover, there are signs of a political crisis in 
the republic as relations are worsening between the executive 
and legislative branches of power. These questions were the 
subject of an Interfax interview with the Vice-President of 
Tatarstan VASILIY LIKHACHYOV. 
  INTERFAX: Having signed the treaty with Russia Kazan 
resolved its political problems: The new status of Tatarstan 
was recognized. But today the republic is facing domestic 
problems which are no less grave. More and more often 
politicians speak of a critical state of the Tatar economy, 
politics and ideology. What is your personal opinion of the 
situation? 
  LIKHACHYOV: During the past few years the Tatar leadership 
has been quite energetically working on its strong 
socio-political potential. Its legal status is evident now. It 
has been formulated. But it so happened that political and 
legal developments went ahead of economic. This is objective 
reality. We had to carry out the tasks put forward in the 
declaration of sovereignty and in the new constitution of 
Tatarstan. 
  The republic, now a truly sovereign state, is facing a 
number 
of contradictions some of which are quite deep. 
  First of all, the legislative and executive branches of 
power 
worked together without conflicts toward a common objective: 
sovereignty and its recognition by Moscow. It is evident that 
the responsibility for the current situation in the republic, 
for the mistakes and shortcomings lie equally on the president, 
his staff, parliament and government. But they also should work 
together to overcome the crisis. Unfortunately, not all power 
structures are ready for such joint work and for reforming 
themselves. Under the constitution both the parliament and the 
government have supervising powers. It is incorrect, to say the 
least, for parliament to try to act separately. I would say it 
is politically wrong. 
  Besides, after signing the treaty with Tatarstan the system 
of values is naturally and logically changing. Everyone was 
convinced that political achievements should open up broad 
prospects for economic reforms. But they should have been 
carried out with reliance on local resources which proved to be 
difficult. A financial, economic and technological collapse 
followed. 
  On the other hand, we somewhat underestimated the high 
degree 
of Tatarstan's integration in the Russian economy. The weakness 
of our stance I think was that it was not comprehensive. Today 
the Tatar leadership is giving up the illusion that when a high 
rise building is on fire one can survive by closing one's own 
door. 
  Tatarstan can hardly work out any independent original 
program of overcoming the crisis: we are in a common economic 
space with Russia, therefore federal processes should be taken 
into account. Speaking of a crisis one should bear in mind that 
the whole of the Russian Federation, Tatarstan being part of it, 
is facing political and economic difficulties. Besides, it is 
evident to me that the anti-crisis program now in the making 
might not work, if the approach to the selection of top 
officials is not changed. 
  INTERFAX: Some analysts claim that a power crisis is moving 
on Tatarstan. Do you think the mutual accusations of parliament 
and government might develop into a more serious conflict that 
can end with the resignation of someone from the top echelon? 
  LIKHACHYOV: Having resolved several important political 
questions the Tatar leadership unfortunately fell into euphoria 
taking the period of stabilization for actual reforms. However, 
the question of deep economic changes and the development of 
projects was never raised. It turned out that the political 
prerequisites for reforms were wonderful, but there was no 
noticeable advancement of economic thinking. 
  Now in typically Russian traditions the republic has started 
looking for a scapegoat. Important matters were resolved better 
or worse during the stabilization period. It is a different 
matter that new versions of advancement should have been sought 
simultaneously. But is the government alone to blame for what 
did not happen? 
  I would like to reiterate that the necessity of serious 
changes in all spheres, including appointments, is evident. One 
must face the truth. I think that many leaders, some quite 
high-ranking, should resign. But the process is always very 
painful and accompanied by personal tragedies. I think that a 
person should first of all realize one's own potential. If one 
feels having exhausted it and become only a professional 
instrument in the hands of others, he must resign. 
  INTERFAX: In Tatarstan unlike many other parts of the 
Russian Federation the political elite did not change. Analysts 
say the party elite is actually still in power at all levels. 
Probably the stabilization period, as you called, it had its 
favorable effect allowing to keep the republic controllable and 
prevent a total collapse of the economy. But will President 
Mintimer Shaymiyev agree to radical changes in his staff? After 
all it was he who formed this team. 
  LIKHACHYOV: Mintimer Shaymiyev will never become a hostage 
of his own associates. Today we can say that there are no 
so-called grey cardinals who could resolve their own problems 
behind his back. On the whole the administration reacts to 
changes in the situation quite adequately. 
  The elite is not homogeneous at all. Many old regional party 
leaders in the new conditions have found their own niche. But 
now it turns out that some of them clearly lack training. And 
that is first of all a personal crisis. 
  Besides, the administration itself is far from being 
perfect. 
On the one hand, it is highly responsible and disciplined, on 
the other, negative tendencies have appeared: territorial 
groups, regional lobbies. 
  The change should begin with the presidential team. I see 
the way out in the appearance of striking, dynamic , unbiased 
persons. Shaymiyev is now facing a most difficult task because 
the constitutional provision that he is a guarantor of rights 
and liberties, a guarantor of stability requires a new 
interpretation. 
  The Tatar economy can no longer be based on oil dollars and 
the Tatar leadership must realize the new standard of tasks 
facing the country. This requires the interference of the 
president and his closest circle that should change in an 
evolutionary as well as revolutionary manner. I think the 
management should be more democratic and open in its work. 
  I know that the criminal world has started approaching 
certain government structures. In my opinion the time is ripe 
to set up a Security Council of Tatarstan. The republic needs a 
normal policy of choosing and appointing officials that would 
not be carried out by certain half-hidden persons. It should be 
an open policy covering the entire government mechanism, 
guaranteeing the change of generations in the Leadership and 
respect for those who are resigning. 
  INTERFAX: The media claim that President Shaymiyev might 
find himself in a similar situation with Boris Yeltsin who in 
their opinion has successfully resolved Russia's foreign 
problems but fails in resolving domestic ones. 
  LIKHACHYOV: I remain an optimist in this respect. I think 
that President Shaymiyev has the necessary willpower, energy, 
possibilities and potential.

  [Text] Tatar nationalist organizations said in a joint 
statement that the Russian president's tour of Tatarstan was 
undesirable. The statement was signed by the All-Union Tatar 
Social Center, the Sovereignty committee, the Marjani society, 
the Azatlyk youth movement, the Working Kazan movement and the 
Republican Party of Tatarstan. 
  They believed that Yeltsin had failed to honor his pledge on 
the Tatar people's sovereignty that he had made during his 
previous tour of the republic. They argued that the elections 
of the Russian president had not been held in Tatarstan, the new 
Russian Constitution was not passed there and the Moscow-Kazan 
treaty ran counter to the people's desires expressed in the 
referendum. 
  According to unconfirmed reports, two members of the Tatar 
independence party Ittifak and Azatlyk went on hunger strike in 
protest against Yeltsin's visit to Tatarstan.

  [Text] Naberezhnye Chelny May 30 TASS--Fighting organised 
crime in Russia must become a top priority task, Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin said. 
  Speaking at a meeting with the leaders of Tatarstan's law 
enforcement bodies on Monday, Yeltsin called for working out a 
legislative framework for the implementation of the federal 
programme of combating organised crime in Russia adopted last 
week. 
  He said special attention should be paid to fighting 
corruption, machinations in the credit and monetary system, tax 
evasion and illegal deals with privatisation vouchers.

  [Text] The Russian government will make a list of 
potentially bankrupt factories, Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
said Monday when he met with the managers of the Kama automobile 
factory KamAZ in Naberezhnye Chelny during his tour of 
Tatarstan. Yeltsin explained that the list would include 
factories which could not be run profitably on their own and 
that it would be updated monthly. 
  He said that the decrees on tighter finances and production 
that he had signed earlier would be supplemented with four new 
decrees of the same kind. 
  He emphasized that the Russian economy, notably its 
manufacturing industries, needed faster restructuring. Because 
this was proceeding slowly, the payment crisis was getting 
worse, he said. 
  He promised that the state would help KamAz which was 
recovering from a fire. Foreign investments would be attracted 
to it and credits would be made available. Yeltsin said that 
KamAz was exempt from profit and value-added taxes until the end 
of the year.

  [Text] In his exclusive interview with Interfax, Bashkirian 
Premier Anatoliy Kopsov gave a high appraisal to the package of 
the inter-governmental agreements between Russia and 
Bashkortostan signed on May 25 in Moscow. In his opinion, 
conclusion of such agreements between the center and the 
republics "would facilitate strengthening of the truly 
federative principles of Russia's existence." 
  Moscow and Ufa have signed a package of 10 agreements 
including those on economic interaction, on division of 
authorities in the sphere of international relations and foreign 
economic activity, on interaction in the sphere of education, 
development of defense branches, crime fighting, etc. 
  Kopsov expressed hope that two agreements on which the 
parties failed to find mutual understanding, namely on budget 
relations and on relations between the Central Bank of Russia 
and National Bank of Bashkortostan, would be also initialled in 
the near term. In his words, the Bashkirian side insists on a 
one-channel system of the budget's formation and Russia -- on a 
tow-channel one. 
  Kopsov also deems it necessary to put in place additional 
powers for the National Bank of Bashkortostan, in particular 
regarding fiscal and currency regulation. 
  Kopsov declared that Bashkortostan would like to fix its 
right to use the gold reserve totalling 250 kilograms of gold 
which was left in Ufa for storage from the "pre-perestroika" 
times as collateral for currency credits received by 
Bashkortostan.

  [Text] Bashkortostan's President Murtaza Rakhimov stated 
that his republic did not need a civic accord agreement. He 
told Interfax that the signing of declarative agreements was a 
waste of time, given a stable political and ethnic situation in 
Bashkortostan. 
  "Russia's troubles are rooted in its ailing economy, not in 
a 
lack of political declarations," he said. 
  He also pointed out that the Bashkortostan leaders had 
concentrated on measures to prevent the economic ruin and to 
create normal conditions for industrial production. 
  To quote Rakhimov, the leaders of Bashkortostan have passed 
a 
number of decrees aimed at shaping reserve salary funds and 
delaying tax payments.

  [Text] Lieutenant General Aleksey Shcherbakov, deputy 
commander of the Russian border troops, headed an inspection 
commission which carried out a systematic survey of the defense 
of Russia's Pacific Ocean border. He held a news conference in 
Vladivostok, at which he said that troops of the Pacific Border 
District were in a state of good combatreadiness. The 
inspectors had the opportunity to witness with their own eyes 
that the eastern border protected by the Pacific troops was 
still strong and secure -- the district's border guards detained 
35 transgressors, uncovered and prevented 63 attempts to use 
counterfeit passports at border crossings, and seized a large 
contraband shipment of choice seafood delicacies, which domestic 
businessmen attempted to export to Japan illegally. 
  The chairman of the inspection commission said: "We 
evaluated 
the situation in the border district strictly and impartially. 
Practically every aspect of the condition of the troops was 
examined, and in spite of the numerous problems, all troops and 
units of the district cope well with the goal of protecting the 
border, and the state of morale of the officers and personnel is 
praiseworthy."

  [Text] On Saturday Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy 
Radetskyy told newsmen in Kiev that security for Ukraine spelled 
overall security. Radetskyy summed up results of an official 
visit by a delegation of Ukrainian military to NATO's 
headquarters in Brussels. 
  According to Radetskyy, the participants in the Brussels 
meeting appreciated the Ukrainian stand on efforts to build a 
new system of security in Europe and approved principles on 
which Ukraine was to build its armed forces. 
  Everyone he met, Radetskyy said, supported, in no uncertain 
terms, the Ukrainian leaders who sought to preserve the 
territorial integrity of their country and insure the 
inviolability of the Ukrainian frontiers. 
  Radetskyy assigned priority to moves "to bridge the 
artificially-created gap between Ukraine and Europe and return 
Ukraine into the family of advanced European nations". 
  As a constituent part of Europe, Ukraine based its moves in 
the field of military politics on the principles of multilateral 
cooperation, Radetskyy said.

appealed to parliaments of several countries and to the human 
rights organization "Amnesty International" with a request to 
help in the search for the deputy chairman of Rukh and head of 
its secretariat, Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, who disappeared without a

countries. The German Christian Democratic Union, the 
Conservative Party of Great Britain, the Conservative Party of 
Norway, the Liberal Party of Finland, and also the Human Rights 
Democratic Institute in Warsaw have already shown interest in 
the Boychyshyn affair. "Perhaps, the fact that Boychyshyn's 
case is becoming increasingly known in the international arena 
will compel law-enforcement bodies, which show total inactivity, 
to do something," a hopeful Vyacheslav Chornovil said.

  [Text] Turkey is ready to use its influence over NATO, the 
European Union and the UN to support the territorial integrity 
of Ukraine and the presence of Crimea within Ukraine. This was 
disclosed to the press by the leader of the Crimean Tartar 
Mejlis Mustafa Jamilev who met Turkish President Suleyman 
Demirel in Kiev on Monday. 
  According to Jamilev, Ukraine has made much greater 
concessions to Crimean separatists than it should have. He was 
satisfied with the fact that now Kiev holds a tougher, 
principled approach to Crimea. The head of the Mejlis called 
Crimea an illegal republic of colonists. 
  He said that the future course of development in Crimea 
depends on how much Russia and other neighbors are going to 
respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Jamilev said 
there are signs today that Russia will continue interfering in 
the situation. 
  In his opinion, the pressure of the world community could 
have a certain effect keeping Russia from actions that 
destabilize the situation in the Crimea. 
  Jamilev said the Turkish president promised to finance the 
construction of about 1000 apartments for Crimean Tatars.

  [Text] The signing of Ukrainian-Turkish interstate 
agreements took place in the White Hall of the Mariyinskyy 
palace. Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Turkish 
President Suleyman Demirel signed a joint statement that 
confirms the two countries' mutual desire to develop friendly 
relations, aim their political moves at strengthening stability 
in the Black Sea region, and intensify cooperation for the good 
of both nations. 
  Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his Turkish 
counterpart signed a protocol on exchange of ratification 
instruments to the treaty on friendship and cooperation between 
Ukraine and Turkey, as well as an interstate agreement on 
cooperation in the sphere of tourism. An intergovernmental 
agreement on international road transport was signed by 
Ukraine's Transport Minister Oprest Klympush. 
  After signing the Ukrainian-Turkish documents, Demirel and 
Kravchuk answered questions from journalists. 
  [Begin Demirel recording in Turkish with superimposed 
Russian 
translation] Turkey and Ukraine are the region's two largest 
countries, and they feel a responsibility for friendship and 
peace in the region. Therefore, their cooperation benefits the 
maintaining of peace in the region and in the world, benefits 
their people. During Mr. Kravchuk's visit to Turkey in 1992 we 
signed an agreement on friendship and cooperation in the trade 
sphere. There are no political problems between Turkey and 
Ukraine. Turkey is against any conquest of territories by 
force, against interference in any country's internal affairs. 
Like the rest of the countries, we support Ukraine in the 
defense of its territorial integrity. Crimea is Ukraine's 
internal affair. [end recording] 
  [Begin Kravchuk recording] Indeed, Crimea is Ukraine's 
internal problem, but since it affects many problems in the 
Black Sea region, we support the principle stipulated by the 
Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly and the treaty that this region 
is a region of peace and cooperation, and that it should be 
strengthened by confidence-building among the states existing 
and working in this region. It means that the problem of Crimea 
here is a Ukrainian problem, but we would not like Crimea to 
upset the balance, the cooperation, and the relations that have 
been and will be established in the region. As far as our 
Crimean problems are concerned, these can be discussed 
separately, especially since the Supreme Council will address 
the problem again the day after tomorrow [1 June], and everyone 
interested can find out the details. [end recording]

  [Text] Agreements on highway transportation and tourism 
cooperation and a protocol on the oil pipeline that will 
transport Middle East oil to Ukraine via Turkey were signed 
between Ukraine and Turkey in Kiev today. TRT correspondent 
Yavuz Yorulmaz reports on President Suleyman Demirel's contacts 
in Ukraine: 
  [Begin recording] [Yorulmaz] This is the palace where the 
agreements were signed with Ukraine. Demirel declared that the 
agreements will encourage the development of bilateral 
relations. Demirel, currently on an official visit to Ukraine, 
is continuing his contacts. The talks between the delegations 
of the two countries headed by their respective presidents were 
also concluded. The joint communique pertaining to the talks 
was signed by Demirel and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. 
  In a statement at the signing ceremony, Demirel said that 
the 
cooperation between Turkey and Ukraine will benefit world peace 
as well as the region. The aim is to increase the existing 
$500-million bilateral volume of trade to $1 billion, Demirel 
stated. Stressing that Turkey is in favor of continued peace in 
its region and in Europe, Demirel noted: We are opposed to 
gaining territory through the use of force or to interfering in 
the internal affairs of other countries. As with other 
countries, we support the territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
  Demirel expressed the belief that bilateral relations will 
develop even further in the future, adding that the necessary 
political will exists to this end. Answering a question 
concerning Crimea, Demirel said that this is Ukraine's internal 
matter. 
  Kravchuk, in reply to a question of whether the protocol on 
the oil pipeline project can be interpreted so as to support 
Turkey's view that the straits not be used in oil 
transportation, declared: As far as we are concerned, this is 
not an issue only between Turkey and Ukraine. It concerns the 
whole of Europe from an environmental aspect. 
  Meanwhile, highway transportation and tourism cooperation 
agreements were also signed between Turkey and Ukraine in Kiev. 
The agreements were signed by the foreign and transportation 
ministers of the two countries. Kravchuk also hosted a dinner 
in honor of Demirel. 
  In his dinner toast, Kravchuk described the visit as a 
natural extension of the constructive dialogue between the two 
countries. He remarked that Ukraine is still at the beginning of 
the path seeking the right place among democratic countries, a 
path long ago discovered by Turkey. He added: What brings us 
together is not just geographic proximity and history. We are 
brought closer together by the economic reforms introduced for 
the people's prosperity and the struggle waged for the 
development of the democratic society. 
  Kravchuk explained that bilateral relations have been based 
on a sound legal foundation and concrete steps were taken in the 
fields of economic, commercial, cultural, and scientific 
cooperation. The two countries must establish closer ties to 
ensure peace and stability in the region and in the whole of 
Europe, Kravchuk said. This visit, he noted, will open a new 
page in the relations between Turkey and his country. 
  Demirel, for his part, declared that a brand new period has 
begun with the reciprocal visits of the two leaders. 
  [Demirel] Turkey believes that the Cold War period should 
not be replaced by a cold peace period. We must now experience 
a period in which nations reach out for one another, [as heard] 
with the most the common history of the human race should become 
one of peace, friendship, solidarity, and cooperation. The fact 
that Ukraine, an important country of our region, shares these 
views with us gives us confidence. 
  [Yorulmaz] The president stated that Turkey is exerting 
great efforts for the peaceful solution of all the problems in 
the region, adding that it is pleasing that Ukraine also takes 
part in these efforts. Pointing out that the Black Sea Economic 
Cooperation brings Turkey and Ukraine closer together, Demirel 
said that it is beneficial for the Black Sea countries to join 
their efforts for the development of friendship and cooperation. 
Turkey sincerely supports Ukraine's goal for modernization as 
well as its independence and territorial integrity, Demirel 
concluded. 
  Demirel laid a wreath at the unknown soldier's monument in 
Kiev today. He will continue his contacts in Ukraine tomorrow 
as well. [end recording]

  [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that 
Turkey's current difficulties should not prevent it from 
exploiting the opportunities it encounters while a new world is 
being established. Demirel stated: Turkey should not drown in 
daily problems or stop seeing what is in front of it. 
  Demirel, who is currently visiting Ukraine as the official 
guest of Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, held a news 
conference at his residence in Kiev yesterday and commented on 
Turkey's foreign policy and his contacts. TRT correspondent 
Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Kiev: 
  [Begin Yorulmaz recording] In his news conference, Demirel 
explained that Ukraine is an important country because of its 
natural resources and its geographical position. If Ukraine 
fails in its goals, Demirel noted, the world will be faced with 
attempts to reactivate the old Soviet system. Stressing that 
Turkey wants to continue its good relations with the newly 
independent former Soviet republics, Demirel noted that Turkey 
has enjoyed goodneighborly and friendly relations with Ukraine 
for 70 years. 
  Demirel remarked that Turkey has not yet reached the desired 
level of cooperation with Ukraine, adding that his visit is 
aimed at further developing the existing opportunities for 
cooperation even further. Within this framework, Demirel 
recalled, a protocol was signed on the construction of the 
Ceyhan-Samsun oil pipeline, and this project will enable the 
transportation of Middle East oil through Turkey to Ukraine via 
the Black Sea, and from there to Europe. Demirel said: This 
benefits Turkey. It is an extremely interesting project. As it 
stands, there is an oil pipeline from Yumurtalik to Kirikkale. 
We can join Kirikkale to Samsun and this matter is solved for 
the beginning. The project to construct an oil pipeline for 40 
million tonnes, which was proposed by them, is an extremely 
important project. We will only charge transit fees. 
  Demirel said that during his contacts, he had the 
opportunity 
to discuss the situation of Crimean Tatars with Ukrainian 
officials. Noting that the Crimean Tatars were mistreated during 
the Stalin period and the world remained a spectator to this 
situation, Demirel remarked that it is Turkey's duty to extend a 
hand to these people at a time when they want to resettle in 
their motherland. 
  Tomorrow morning Demirel will proceed to Moldova, the second 
leg of his tour. [end recording]

  [Text] The second round of negotiations between government 
delegations of Russia and Ukraine on the problems of the Black 
Sea Fleet will begin in 10-15 days in the Ukrainian capital, 
acting Prime Minister of Ukraine Yukhym Zvyahilskyy told 
journalists upon his return from the meeting in Moscow. 
  Summing up the meeting, he said: "We did not win in Moscow, 
but neither did we lose. The talks were very nervous and tense." 
  "We were trying," he said, "to find options of positive 
solutions in fulfilling the tasks set by the president of 
Ukraine. We made concessions, but not those which would make 
Ukraine lose its wealth and independence." 
  Zvyahilskyy believes that a generally positive solution was 
found to the problem of separate deployment of the Black Sea 
Fleet and Ukraine's navy. Sevastopol will be the main Russian 
naval base in the Black Sea, while Ukraine's navy will be based 
in Balaklava and Donuzlav.

negotiating process is proceeding constructively, Vice Admiral 
Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, Ukraine's Navy Commander, reported at a 
news conference on the results of the latest Russian-Ukrainian 
Black Sea Fleet talks, which he conducted on 27 May. The 
Russian side has taken up a softer position. The fact that for 
the first time we are discussing details in depth and are 
working on each facility in detail adds optimism. The Russian 
delegation was discussing issues that it had avoided at the 
talks in Sevastopol. One feels that Russia's delegation has a 
purpose: To resolve the issue," Mr. Bezkorovaynyy emphasized.

  [Excerpt] The chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council today 
met representatives of foreign embassies and consulates in 
Ukraine. 
  [Correspondent] More than 50 countries have embassies and 
missions in Ukraine today. Their heads and diplomats took part 
in this meeting today. Extending warm greetings to his guests, 
Ukraine's Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz said: 
  [Begin Moroz recording] Diplomats are concerned at the 
events 
taking place today in Ukraine. One such event is, of course, 
the situation in Crimea. The Supreme Council and I have done 
and will do our best in order to relieve in a civilized and 
non-violent way the tension over the conflict caused by 
excessive use of subjective influences in the settlement of the 
problems which indeed exist in Crimea today. I am talking first 
of all about negotiations and, thus, a return of 
parliamentarians and other power structures in Crimea into the 
Ukrainian constitutional channel. The general view is this: 
Everybody who is guided by common sense understands that the 
Crimea-Ukraine status quo must be preserved, and this fully

recording] 
  [Correspondent] The Ukrainian parliament speaker stressed 
that the Crimean problem is not the only one which calls for the 
Supreme Council's attention. It is necessary that we urgently 
set about pulling our economy out of crisis. Considering the 
nature of his audience, Oleksandr Moroz also spoke about the 
need to encourage foreign investors who could help Ukraine build 
an independent state. He also spoke about Ukraine's nuclear 
status which naturally concerns diplomats. Oleksandr Moroz 
expressed his willingness to meet personally each of the foreign 
diplomatic representatives in Ukraine in the future. [passage

    [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1600 GMT on 30 May carries a 27-minute recorded 
news conference by Ukrainian Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr 
Moroz in Kiev on 30 May. No video is available. 
  Moroz is asked about Ukraine's participation in the 
Interparliamentary Assembly of CIS countries. Moroz says he 
believes Ukraine should be part of this structure "because there 
are so many issues to be resolved today--first and foremost, 
economic issues in relations and within the CIS." 
  Moroz then discusses the Crimean issue. He says: "We have 
just formed a commission of parliamentary deputies headed by 
Borys Oliynyk. They will leave for Crimea in the near future 
and will work with the relevant commission of the Crimean 
parliament. In my view, we should finally agree on a joint 
result that will consent to the abrogation of the decisions of 
the Crimean parliament on the introduction of the 1992 
Constitution." 
  Moroz says there is a need to avoid confrontation between 
the 
Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments. He adds: "I understand 
that, in a different situation, one could resort to more radical 
measures. Today, however, it is not in the interests of the 
world community, of Ukraine, or of many individual countries. 
They would not be happy if the Crimean situation became 
aggravated. Therefore, in my view, it is simply necessary to 
pursue a considered and restraining policy in order to keep the 
radicals in Crimea, as well as radicals in other places, within 
the Constitution." 
  Speaking on a political union with Russia, Moroz said: "I 
think that we have a political union with Russia today on the 
basis of a treaty signed--if I am not mistaken--on 19 November 
1991. If we need to clarify some articles of this treaty, and 
if there is such a need, then I think we will come to an 
agreement with the Russian leadership, and we will conclude a 
new treaty. A key aspect of this document, however, would 
undoubtedly be the full state sovereignty or state independence 
of Ukraine, as well as the state independence of Russia. This 
would be a treaty between great neighboring countries." 
  On the subject of nuclear weapons, Moroz says that foreign 
leaders were constantly asking when Ukraine would become a 
non-nuclear state, but they never spoke about the conditions 
that their states had to fulfill if this happened. 
  Answering a question on the problems of the Black Sea Fleet, 
Moroz says that it was indeed a very complex issue and that many 
mistakes had been made. He says he believes that the fleet 
should be an element of collective defense but that much time 
had already been wasted. He adds that the Black Sea was a zone 
of specific interest to both Ukraine and Russia and that the 
problems of the fleet should be resolved proceeding from this 
fact. 
  Moroz says he would decline to speak in any more detail on 
the issue of the fleet because "there are many aspects that are 
very important in themselves. When we begin to take these 
aspects as a basis, then we can come up with a decision that is 
contrary to what was envisaged when this subject was included in 
the agreement or negotiations." He adds that "we should work 
toward creating both a Ukrainian fleet and a Russian fleet that 
will always have relations between themselves." 
  Speaking on the subject of nuclear disarmament and the arms 
question in general, Moroz says that Ukraine's acquisition of a 
non-nuclear status creates certain advantages for the West. He 
says: "We gave them the possibility of earning additional 
profits. Take, for example, the trade in arms. In the last two 
years, the volume of the arms trade by the United States has 
increased by approximately 18 billion U.S. dollars, whereas we 
have nothing, even though we have enterprises, developed 
technology, and products that we could sell in foreign markets." 
Moroz adds that the objective interests of Ukraine's economy 
must be taken into account and says these interests involve 
Ukraine's manufacturing potential, which today is dependent on 
the military industrial complex and on those enterprises that 
manufacture nuclear weapons. 
  On the subject of land privatization, Moroz says that land 
should not be bought and sold, but could be leased for a period 
of 90 years or for shorter periods and that this would not be a 
threat to foreign investment.

  [Text] Ukraine cannot afford nuclear weapons, Aleksandr 
[Oleksandr] Moroz, the country's parliament chairman said in 
Kiev Monday. He added, however, that Ukraine was the sole 
country in the world that was gradually becoming nuclear-free. 
  Moroz said that Ukraine could not make this step all at 
once, 
no matter what kind of pressure was brought to bear on it. In 
his view, the West had to meet Ukraine half-way. The Western 
countries had to understand that investing in Ukrainian 
disarmament was not charity but payment for the security they 
enjoy as a result of Ukraine's moves. 
  Moroz admitted that he had once regarded the Black Sea Fleet 
as an element of collective defense forces. But now it was time 
to become aware of the fact that Ukraine and Russia had 
different interests in the Black Sea, meaning two friendly 
navies had to be set up. 
  He said that he would work for closer relations with Russia 
but thought that Ukraine's rejoining the ruble zone would do no 
good either to Ukraine or Russia.

  [Text] Kiev May 31 TASS -- Financial assistance to Ukraine 
in the construction of new nuclear power stations, so that the 
Chernobyl station could be shut down, was discussed during a 
closed door meeting between Group-of-Seven experts and a 
Ukrainian Government delegation here on Tuesday. 
  According to well-informed sources, the international group 
of experts, after a series of meetings and consultations and the 
study of the situation, will prepare a report with due regard 
for the Ukrainian Government's wishes. 
  The report will serve as the basis of a project for 
assistance to Kiev. The project is then to be considered at a 
working meeting of G-7 representatives in Rome in June. 
  A specific `nuclear assistance' programme is to be discussed 
at a regular G-7 summit in Naples in July.

  [Text] Oleksandr Moroz, chairman of the Supreme Council of 
Ukraine, and Daniel Kaufmann, chairman of the World Bank's 
regional office, held a meeting at the latter's request devoted 
to issues of investing foreign capital in Ukraine's economy. 
  As is known, the World Bank unites 180 countries and 
annually 
draws up over 100 projects in the privatization sphere, reform 
of entrepreneurship, and the development of the private sector. 
Ukraine was admitted to this organization in 1992. 
  The chairman of the World Bank's regional office acquainted 
Oleksandr Moroz with his activities in Ukraine. Daniel Kaufmann 
said that already now the World Bank can annually allocate 1 
billion dollars to Ukraine. However, for this purpose the 
Ukrainian side should make a decision on the legal protection of 
foreign investments. 
  The Supreme Council chairman and World Bank representative 
exchanged opinions concerning the state of the Ukrainian economy 
and possible projects. According to Oleksandr Moroz, the 
drawing up of a program for stabilizing Ukraine's economy is 
nearing completion. This program, called Trud [Labor], is being 
devised with the participation of qualified specialists who were 
not involved in such projects before. Great hopes are pinned on 
the Supreme Council of Ukraine standing Commission for Issues of 
Economic Reform, which consists of businessmen and specialists 
in the market relations sphere.

  [Text] Ukraine has become the fourth country following 
Israel, Egypt, and Russia, which will receive considerable U.S. 
financial aid in the near future. Oleh Bilorus, Ukraine's 
ambassador to the United States of America declared this at a 
meeting with journalists. He pointed out that the Ukrainian 
Embassy in the United States managed to convince the U.S. 
Government that Ukraine requires aid today, when the first steps 
toward a market economy are being made. Bilorus underlined that 
President Bill Clinton's attitude toward Ukraine changed for the 
better and the United States of America was ready to support 
Ukraine politically and economically to consolidate its 
independence.

  [Text] The Ostankino TV company covers relations between 
Ukraine and Russia tendentiously. It does not provide authentic 
information and therefore fails to promote neighborly ties 
between the two countries. President Leonid Kravchuk made this 
statement on Saturday, commenting at journalists' request on the 
decision to deprive several Ostankino reporters of their 
accreditation in Ukraine. 
  Earlier the press service of Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
deprived Ostankino reporters in Donetsk, Kharkov and Odessa of 
their accreditation. 
  Nevertheless, President Kravchuk said that Ukraine is not 
against a unified information space. It only wants the coverage 
of events in that space to be objective. 
  Leonid Kravchuk also criticized some Ukrainian news media 
for 
having a penchant for "hot" facts and for failing to present a 
complete picture of developments and processes in Ukraine. He 
did not specify precisely what publications he meant.

Denied Accreditation"] 
  [Text] Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has adopted a 
decision to deprive correspondents of the "Ostankino" television 
company who work in Ukraine of their accreditation. This was 
stated to UKRINFORM by Yuriy Serhyeyev, chief of the Information 
Administration at Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He 
pointed out that the decision had been adopted in view of the 
actions, which are incompatible with international concepts of 
information. The representative of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs also stated that the decision had been adopted following 
"the provocative coverage of events in Odessa, the Crimea, and 
in Eastern Ukraine." All of this led us to adopt such a 
decision, he said. We are not depriving these mass media of a 
possibility to work, but we want information carried by them to 
be objective.

  [Text] Russia may sign the NATO Partnership for Peace 
program in June, well informed sources close to the Russian 
government told Interfax. The Russian Foreign Ministry and the 
Defense Ministry intend to propose that Russian President Boris 
Yeltsin join the NATO program before his official visit to 
Naples for the G7 summit planned for early July. The ministries 
made such a decision after the visit of Russian Defense Minister 
Pavel Grachev to the NATO headquarters in Brussels, the same 
sources added. 
  The sources said that in Brussels the NATO defense ministers 
had spoken in favor of Russia joining the Partnership for Peace 
(PP) program. At the same time, the NATO defense ministers 
regarded Grachev's proposal to sign simultaneously the PP 
program and the Russia-NATO program on cooperation "with 
understanding." 
  The same sources told Interfax that the time frame for 
Russia 
joining the PP program would depend on how early the NATO 
defense ministers consider the formula of the Russia-NATO 
program on cooperation.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS--Russian Defence Minister Grachev 
said that Russia may join NATO's Partnership for Peace programme 
within two to three weeks. 
  Speaking at a meeting with visiting parliamentary state 
secretary of the German Defence Ministry Michaela Geiger, 
Grachev said that the final date of signing will depend on how 
soon Russia's proposals are considered and approved by NATO. 
  Grachev stressed that the results of his visit to Brussels 
and his speech at the NATO headquarters have been approved by 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin. He added that technical 
aspects of Russia's accession to the programme will be ironed 
out through diplomatic channels. 
  He expressed the confidence that Geiger's visit will help 
boost Russian-German ties, especially in the military sphere. 
"Strong German-Russian relations will guarantee stability in 
Europe, because in terms of military might Germany is second 
only to Russia in Europe," Grachev said. 
  Speaking about his recent visit to Brussels, Grachev said 
that Russia's position was met with understanding by NATO 
leaders, adding that he was "pleasantly surprised" by the 
positive reaction to Russia's proposals from the Baltic states. 
  He stressed that Russia will not seek to take part in 
discussions on NATO internal issues. It only wants to 
coordinate with NATO on matters concerning peace-keeping 
operations and prevention of conflicts. 
  The talks with Geiger were also attended by First Deputy 
Defence Minister Andrey Kokoshin. During the visit, Geiger will 
tour one of the military units, a Moscow aircraft plant and a 
space training centre. 
  Russian governmental circles confirmed on Monday that no 
concrete date when Russia will sign the Partnership for Peace 
programme has been named so far. They said it will depend not 
only on Moscow, because the NATO leaders need to study Russia's 
proposals concerning key elements of partnership.

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>
  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Chairman of the Duma Committee 
for Defence Sergey Yushenkov described as "symbolic" today's 
meeting between Russian and American MP's [members of 
parliament] in the lower house of the Russian parliament. 
  "Starting from this day," he stated, "the strategic missiles 
of Russia, the United States and Great Britain will no longer be 
aimed at targets in the three countries. This means that the 
agreements reached by Boris Yeltsin, Bill Clinton and John 
Major, aimed at consolidating world peace and international 
security, are going into effect." 
  Leader of the U.S. delegation Sam Nunn, chairman of the 
Senate Committee on Armed Services, noted the extraordinary 
character of the current meeting between American and Russian 
MPs. He said that the meetings he had with members of the 
Supreme Soviet during his numerous visits to Moscow over the 
past 20 years were purely formal, protocol-type functions, while 
the current one was marked by cordiality. He said that his 
delegation wanted to have serious talks with the Russian 
parliamentary committees, dealing with military matters. Nunn 
added that his delegation also planned to meet representatives 
of the executive branch of government, but would focus mainly on 
talks with parliament members. 
  Dwelling on the nature of the forthcoming contacts with 
representatives of the U.S. Congress, Yushenkov told ITAR-TASS 
that the parliamentarians of the two countries wanted to discuss 
matters linked with the work of the Duma Committee on Defence 
and the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services to adopt 
military budgets and ratify international treaties, primarily 
the START-1 and START-2 agreements. Yushenkov said that the 
sides would also discuss problems linked with the expansion of 
relations between Russia and the United States, and also 
problems of security. "Of course, we shall discuss also the 
all-embracing NATO Partnership for Peace programme," Yushenkov 
stated. 
  He expressed the hope that some common approaches to those 
problems would be determined, and "we shall be able to reach 
agreement on further cooperation within the frameworks of the 
agreements reached as a result of Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin's 
recent visit to the United States". Yushenkov said that he 
hoped the visit of the American delegation would turn a new page 
in the cooperation of the two parliaments.

<F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Nadein: "Russian Mafia Alarms America"] </F>
  [Text] Washington -- The U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has held 
hearings on the question of organized crime in Russia. The 
members of the subcommittee, headed by the very influential 
legislator Sam Nunn, were addressed by Louis Freeh, director of 
the FBI; Hans-Ludwig Zachert, president of the German federal 
criminal police, and Mikhail Yegorov, Russian first deputy 
minister of internal affairs. 
  "Today organized crime in the former Soviet Union is an 
international problem," the FBI director noted. "A global 
problem can only be solved by global methods," Senator Nunn said 
in his opening speech. No one has accused the Americans of 
interfering in our internal affairs. Russia does not feel sorry 
for its mafia. But the chairman, wishing to avoid any possible 
misunderstanding, immediately explained what the U.S. interest 
is. 
  First, crime -- and organized crime above all -- has become 
a 
threat to the democratic transformations in Russia and is 
pushing the country toward national socialism. Second, it is 
undermining U.S.-Russian business links. Third, it has 
penetrated U.S. territory. Fourth, it poses a potential nuclear 
threat: Criminal groups dream of capturing mass destruction 
weapons in order to be able to hold the world to ransom. Fifth, 
Russian organized crime has breathed new life into trafficking 
and contraband in narcotics. 
  Another important reason for the Senate hearing was the fact 
that the United States has the world's richest police experience 
in combating organized crime. Several senators compared the 
dangerous streets in Moscow today with Chicago in the twenties 
and thirties, in order to demonstrate how familiar the 
difficulties and hardships of the young democratic Russia are to 
Americans, who have still not beaten this monster. 
<H5>  When Was the Gun Loaded? </H5>
  The distinctive and in many respects unparalleled organized 
crime of the postcommunist world is not a brand-new phenomenon, 
although, as FBI Director L. Freeh said, "only four years ago 
the former Soviet Union did not officially recognize organized 
crime among its serious problems." 
  There was no objection from his colleagues to this 
viewpoint. 
The German expert put the flare-up of organized crime down to 
the "opening up of Eastern Europe and its desire for political 
changes" and to the criminals' extraordinarily swift adaptation 
to completely new circumstances. 
  The general from the Internal Affairs Ministry [MVD], 
Mikhail 
Yegorov, gave a more detailed account: "The growth of criminal 
associations in the former USSR was due to the state command 
system of government and its result -- the shadow economy. The 
numerous efforts in the sixties and seventies to change economic 
laws by force encouraged the expansion of the underground market 
and the creation of a substantial criminal potential. Illegal 
industrial and commercial structures appeared. Major thefts 
became widespread in the state and public sectors of the economy 
and official corruption became common. A new social stratum 
emerged, comprising people with large amounts of illegal 
capital. At the same time, in the criminal milieu tens of 
thousands of bosses of various ranks were trained within prison 
walls." 
  According to Yegorov, the changes that then took place in 
public and political life led to a conflict of interests between 
dealers in the shadow economy and the traditional criminal 
world, particularly for spheres of influence. But they soon 
found a common language based on mutual interest. Dirty money, 
legalized in the economic sphere through bank fraud, theft, 
racketeering, robbery, and the sale of weapons and drugs, 
sewrved to develop organized crime. 
<H5>  Twenty "Dirty" Billion </H5>
  FBI Director Freeh from America, President H.-L. Zachert 
from 
Germany, and Gen. M.K. Yegorov from Russia are the senior people 
in their countries responsible for the fight against organized 
crime. They have all climbed the professional ladder, from the 
bottom to the top. All three are regarded not only as 
experienced leaders but also as experts in the field. As they 
sat there at the same table they often referred to one another's 
speeches. Not once did they resort to refuting a colleague's 
words; they agreed on practically everything, only rarely 
providing extra clarification. So it could be said that the data 
on organized crime cited by Yegorov are shared by the chiefs of 
the leading Western police services and their numerous experts. 
  According to Yegorov, 785 organized criminal groups were 
active in Russia in 1990. In early 1994 there were already 
5,691 known groups, led by nearly 3,000 criminal bosses, and 
they included 279 "godfathers." (Director Freeh had earlier 
given the openmouthed senators a popular account of our 
linguistic termninology, enunciating in Russian words which have 
become common parlance here, such as "vor v zakone" 
["godfather"], "vorovskoy zakon" ["criminals' law"], "blatnoy" 
[criminal], "smotryashchiy" [?someone who keeps a lookout], 
"obshchak" [fund of money for criminal purposes], and so on. 
Some 926 groups make up 155 criminal associations with 
memberships of between 70 and 300. The total number of active 
members of these associaitons is more than 100,000. But there 
is no single organized crime center in Russia and the groups and 
their leaders have many differences. 
  Bank frauds were recognized as the largest-scale crime in 
Russia. "It appears that the most frequent form of criminal 
activity bringing in high profits in Russia is bank frauds and 
other forms of swindle in which corrupt businessmen and 
government functionaries participate," the FBI director said. 
"At the present time the FBI has launched several special 
investigations into Russian-American enterprises which have 
engaged in laundering `dirty' money through American banking 
institutions. These complex schemes are linked with 
multilateral international transactions, and in many cases are 
at the final stage sent back to Russia in the form of cash." 
Freeh attributed the deaths of 35 Russian bankers in the past 
year to the handiwork of organized crime, perfectly obviously in 
pursuit of the goal of gaining control over the Russian 
financial system. 
  He also added that amendments adopted by Congress in October 
1992 to the law on the procedure for investigating the 
laundering of "dirty" money are making U.S. soil less congenial 
to Russian crooks, and that cooperation with the MVD will enable 
a significant proportion of the billions of dollars which 
disappear to the West every year to be returned. 
  Gen. Yegorov again confirmed that the sum of this money is 
roughly equal to $20 billion. He acknowledged that his 
subordinates do not yet have sufficient experience and knowledge 
to put active members of criminal groups behind bars. However, 
the majority of them are under MVD surveillance. 
  President Zachert did not express optimism. In his opinion, 
Germany has been in the past few years not just an arena of high 
criminal activity on the part of Russian criminals, but also a 
place for them to relax and plan new operations, a place for 
their families to live and bring up their children. "Several 
instances of extortion, often connected with the kidnap of 
family members, have been recorded in Germany," President 
Zachert said. "In the majority of cases this is directed 
against former Russians well known for their criminal past." He 
also cited cases where German businessmen have also been victims 
of savage beatings for refusing to pay up to extortioners from 
private Russian "protection bureaus." 
  The FBI director thoroughly analyzed every case of criminal 
actions against Americans in Russia, and Gen. Yegorov reported a 
high clear-up rate for such crimes. However, senators intimated 
unambiguously to the MVD's authorized representative that they 
consider the actions of the Russian militia in investigating 
crimes against American citizens to be extremely slow. 
  Verging on Fantasy 
  The most mystical part of international police operations 
(and criminal actions too, however) is connected with nuclear 
fissionable materials. 
  Let us leave to one side the science-crime-fiction element, 
although it was referred to by Senator Cohen in posing questions 
about the probability of components for the manufacture of 
nuclear charges falling into criminal hands. And let us not 
censure the Americans for being more worried about the threat of 
a nuclear bomb explosion somewhere among New York's skyscrapers 
than about Chechen crimes in Moscow. The problem is fueled by 
the fact that many entirely respectable publications and 
television companies have published reports about kilograms of 
plutonium which have already been stolen from Russian 
enterprises and military bases. And about the tonnes of 
plutonium which will mysteriously disappear tomorrow. Such an 
article, which has just been published in the magazine ATLANTIC 
MONTHLY, was cited during the hearings by Senator Nunn. On 
these questions, the FBI director stated that "as of the present 
time not one case is known in which the existence for sale of 
highly enriched materials suitable for the manufacture of 
nuclear weapons has been confirmed by the law-enforcement 
organs." However, he added that there have been many cases of 
the illegal transportation of uranium and plutonium in Europe, 
and that all this material had been stolen in the former USSR. 
  For his part, Yegorov analyzed in detail, without exception, 
every case of the theft of nuclear material. He graphically 
demonstrated that it invariably involved material which, if it 
were to be regarded as a real threat, would require intensive 
reprocessing at a number of specialized enterprises. 
  The demand for radioactive materials in Europe, particularly 
Germany, was described by president Zachert as a myth, one to 
which the "crassest section" of the criminal world responds with 
surprising persistence. It has been proved, he stated, that 
there is no market for such products in Europe. However, the 
danger of real weapons of mass destruction being stolen cannot 
be ruled out. Zachert said that this kind of control requires 
considerable expenditure on specialized equipment. Moreover, 
the lack of demand here today does not mean that it won't appear 
tomorrow in another place. 
<H5>  The "Golden Crescent" and Dope-Induced "Highs" from Chernobyl </H5>
  It was noted at the conference that the enormous 
contribution 
of the post-Soviet area to the world trade in narcotics was not 
a myth but a proven reality. 
  The enormous potential of the "Golden Crescent" -- Pakistan, 
Afghanistan, and Iran -- in producing opium has become a factor 
posing a serious threat since the previously carefully guarded 
borders of the USSR collapsed and disappeared Through 
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, which add their own 
narcotics production to the goods in transit, the route runs via 
Kazakhstan, Russia, the Baltic states, and Poland to West Europe. 
  Modern semi-industrial facilities for manufacuring synthetic 
drugs operate in Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia [as 
published], while poppy straw, which also goes for export, grows 
around Chernobyl, although it is not of such good quality as 
that from Kirghizia [Kyrgyzstan] and the Chu Valley. 
  Because of the absence of borders and the utter corruption 
of 
officials, this route has become so easy and accessible that the 
Colombian cocaine barons now use it too. According to a 
representative of the German police, where narcotics 
infiltration routes are studied specially carefully, Moscow's 
Sheremetyevo Airport has become an important transit point for 
smuggling drugs to the West. 
<H5>  Time Is Short </H5>
  The leaders of the world's three largest police agencies 
agreed that they are dealing with clever, treacherous, and 
ruthless enemies. They unanimously expressed themselves in 
favor of the closest cooperation: The American, the German, and 
the Russian confirmed that time is short. 
  Freeh reported that he will very shortly be visiting Moscow 
as part of a high-powered American delegation (State Department, 
Treasury, and Drug Enforcement Administration), where an agency 
maintaining constant liaison between the MVD and the FBI will be 
opened. "Our cooperation requires a legislative foundation," 
Yegorov stated. According to him, the present high level of 
cooperation is due to the personal trust and liking that exists 
between him and the FBI director. "But cooperation should not 
depend on likes," the MVD general stated. 
  Asked by Senator Nunn what he would do with $15-20 million 
("I'm not giving it to you, it's just a hypothetical question," 
the American hastened to add, making plain the cold reality), 
Yegorov said: I would buy computers, develop a data base, and 
assemble people for two kinds of attack on crime -- 
brainstorming and the armed approach. However, he described the 
creation of international police groups to investigate specific 
cases as the chief prerequisite for success in the fight against 
international crime. The Russian general unambiguously rejected 
any likelihood of the occurrence of what is the topic of 
animated discussion in the American press, namely the 
possibility of power being seized in Russia by a criminal group. 
However, he did not rule out a turn of events whereby a mafia 
stooge is elected a deputy or appointed to high office. 
  The session of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations has not received extensive comment in the press 
yet but has been briefly commented on in television bulletins. 
Asked by me whether he could compare the hearings in the 
American Senate and the Russian Duma, Yegorov said: 
  "I won't answer because I don't want to offend anyone...."

  [Text] Paris May 27 TASS -- "The signing of an agreement on 
Russian-European partnership will be a major Russian step to 
Europe," Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev told ITAR-TASS 
correspondent while in Paris to attend an international 
conference on a stability pact. 
  In the words of Kozyrev, much work has been done to finalize 
the document, and it is clear already now the document will be 
fundamental. Technical details will be coordinated and the 
document will be edited and translated into languages of 
states-members of the European Union. 
  The minister did not exclude experts may fail to do this job 
by the next session of the European Union to be held in June. 
That is why, the agreement will be signed later, and initialed 
in June. He stressed "there is no need to hurry, since the 
basic agreement to sign the document has been reached". 
  The Russian-European agreement is very important from the 
political point of view, stressed the minister. This document 
will provide for the future form of all Russian-European 
relations. The agreement envisages a system of political 
consultations, a mechanism of political interaction. Under the 
document, summit meeting with the leaders of the "European 
Three" will be held at least once in two years, and contacts 
between ministers will be regular. 
  A major aspect of the agreement is that it opens way "to 
gradual but decisive Russian entrance to the world markets of 
goods, including products of the nuclear cycle, services, 
capital and labor", said the minister. The document will lay 
down the basis for fundamental political and economic 
interaction between Russia and the European Union, he said.

  [Text] Paris, 27 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey 
Kozyrev had talks with his Croatian counterpart Mate Granic 
during the international conference on stability in Europe that 
has been held here. The Russian minister told the ITAR-TASS 
correspondents today that the sides exchanged views on the 
prospects for an end to the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 
analyzed the work of the Contact Group working on a Bosnian 
settlement, which has been meeting representatives of the 
warring sides in the French town of Talloires over the past few 
days. 
  "The work of the Contact Group is coming up against great 
difficulties, but everything is turning out reasonably well: 
Gratifyingly, we managed to get the Serb side to take part in 
the group's session," the minister pointed out. "Our western 
colleagues have also fulfilled the promises they made in Geneva 
in mid-May, and have got the Bosnian Muslims and Croats to the 
negotiating table." 
  Andrey Kozyrev said he had information that the Muslim and 
Croat sides are virtually ready to accept the plan proposed for 
the territorial division of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This plan 
allots 51 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina to a 
Croat-Muslim federation, and 49 percent to the Bosnian Serbs.

  [Excerpts] Beijing, 27 May -- Jiang Zemin, chairman of the 
People's Republic of China, accepted Russian Federation 
President Boris Yeltsin's invitation to make an official visit 
to Russia with great enthusiasm, Russian Prime Minister Viktor 
Chernomyrdin announced at a news conference in Beijing on the 
second day of his visit. [passage omitted] 
  Chernomyrdin said: "We were unanimous in the view that 
relations between our countries are on a firm path towards 
constructive partnership on a broad range of bilateral and 
international problems." 
  The prime minister believes that China can play an important 
role in opening up Siberia and the Far East. The possibility of 
Russia participating in the reconstruction and modernization of 
industrial enterprises built with the help of the USSR in the 
1950's was discussed, along with the building of the "three 
gorge" hydroscheme power installations. The sides agreed to 
lift obstacles hindering joint enterprise, investment 
cooperation, and other forms of direct partnership. [passage 
omitted] 
  The exchange of views during the talks and meetings with the

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May -- A stable, friendly China that is 
successfully implementing reforms is in Russia's national 
interests. The strategic aims for the socioeconomic development 
of both states coincide in what is most important or are running 
in parallel, which, consequently, creates reliable preconditions 
for joint production and cooperation. This was stated today by 
Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, as he 
addressed representatives of Chinese business circles at the PRC 
committee for promoting the development of international trade. 
  Broad prospects are now opening up, the prime minister 
noted, 
for Russian-Chinese relations to attain a fundamentally new 
level of constructive partnership, geared toward the 21st 
century. It [the partnership] is in the two countries' national 
interests and is an important factor in maintaining peace and 
stability in the Asia- Pacific region and throughout the world. 
  Meanwhile, continued Chernomyrdin, Russia and China -- whose 
trade turnover is approaching $8 billion -- are yet to explore 
the great potential of objective possibilities for joint 
economic activities. The noticeable drop in trade turnover, 
especially at the beginning of the year, prompt us to look for 
new forms of mutually beneficial forms of interaction. 
  In Chernomyrdin's opinion, mutual investments and attracting 
Chinese investments and the work force into exploration of 
Russian natural resources and construction of infrastructure 
facilities, as well as Russia's participation in large projects 
in China. [sentence as received] 
  It is now time to think about creating joint investment and 
brokering corporations and there is the possibility to 
re-examine the agreement on the clearing system of payments. 
  The Russian prime minister also called for broadening 
cooperation in the sphere of conversion of defense enterprises. 
  He proposed elevating border ties to a higher level by 
promoting production cooperation and the creation of trade zones 
with a special regime for foreign investment. At the talks with 
Premier Li Peng there was a discussion of the question of 
setting up a bilateral inter-regional body for coordinating 
trade and economic cooperation between border regions. 
  Dwelling on the economic situation in Russia, the Russian 
Government chairman noted that in just over two years of reforms 
progress had been achieved in establishing market relations and 
consolidating the legal basis of the state. 
  Chernomyrdin told the representatives of business circles 
that the Russian Government intends by January to reduce 
inflation to 5-7 percent. In his opinion, of important 
significance here are the edicts signed a few days ago by the 
Russian president on tax policy, strengthening the budget and 
payments discipline, normalizing accounting, liberalizing 
foreign economic activity, and the reforms of state enterprises. 
  The state does not intend to throw loss-making state 
enterprises to the mercy of fate. The necessary help will be 
given to ease the difficulties of the period of transition. 
Above all, this concerns questions of the social sphere. The 
government is taking specific actions, which will help to 
prevent, in practice, a further reduction in the living 
standards of the Russian people and to keep inevitable 
unemployment at a socially acceptable level, the Russian prime 
minister said.

  [Text] Shanghai, 28 May -- "The economic zone in Shanghai 
is a real miracle, and the Chinese experiment should be put to 
use in Russia as quickly as possible," Russian Prime Minister 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said today after acquainting himself with a 
new district of China's largest city. A visit to the Pudong 
economic development zone was the main item on the agenda for 
the third day of the Russian prime minister's official visit to 
China. 
  After looking at Pudong, Viktor Chernomyrdin told 
journalists 
of the need to start real work right away on free economic zones 
in Russia, perhaps without even waiting for a law on them to be 
passed. "We need to start immediately in individual parts, in 
the regions," he said. The head of government also stated his 
intention to "immediately fly to Nakhodka" where there are plans 
to set up a free economic zone and, if possible, to prepare the 
appropriate presidential decree. "This should be the locomotive 
that will move everything else," Viktor Chernomyrdin concluded. 

    During his visit to Pudong, the deputy head of 
administration 
of the district, Huang Qifan, told the Russian prime minister 
how the new territory had been exploited. Huge resources had 
been invested in Pudong during the four years of its existence. 
At present, there are about 2,000 enterprises with foreign 
involvement registered here, and the total investment through 
concluded contracts amounts to $8.5 billion. 
  According to Huang Qifan, foreign investment is being 
directed not only into the development of industry, but also 
into trade and economic and financial spheres. Large resources 
-- more than 20 billion yuans -- have been used to set up the 
infrastructure. The deputy head of the district administration 
gave two reasons for the success: the state's preferential tax 
policy and the major investment of Chinese national capital, $10 
billion over less than five years. 
  The Russian prime minister showed special interest in the 
conditions of preferential taxation. 
  The district leaders presented Viktor Chernomyrdin with a 
package of documents concerning the functioning of Pudong and 
also a symbolic souvenir -- a stone from the Nanpu suspension 
bridge, which was crossed by the Russian delegation's motorcade. 

    Viktor Chernomyrdin also visited a joint Chinese-Japanese 
enterprise producing air conditioning systems and the Waigaoqiao 
free trade zone. 
  Then, the head of the Russian government laid flowers at the 
monument to Aleksandr Pushkin. 
  Viktor Chernomyrdin's program in Shanghai ended with a 
meeting with the city's leaders. 
  Tomorrow. the prime minister leaves Shanghai for Dalian.

  [Text] Beijing, 27 May -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin has 
accepted with great enthusiasm the invitation from Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin to pay an official visit to Russia. 
This was stated at a news conference in Beijing today by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, head of the Russian Government, on the second day 
of his visit to the PRC. 
  The prime minister said that the visit by the Chinese leader 
should take place in September. It was proposed that on his way 
to Moscow, Jiang Zemin should visit one of Russia's regions, 
most probably one in the Far East. 
  We regard the forthcoming meeting of the leaders of the two 
states as very important, Chernomyrdin stated. He added that 
the conversation that he had had today with Jiang Zemin had been 
rich in content and very interesting. 
  What we have done represents great progress in the 
development of our relations, he stressed, summing up the 
results of the two days of his visit to the PRC. The head of 
the Russian Government noted the "smooth development" of links 
between the two countries and stressed that the main stratum of 
Russian-Chinese relations has not yet been reached and the sides 
are only now approaching it. 
  Chernomyrdin pointed out that the reduction in the volume of 
bilateral trade in the first quarter of this year was a 
temporary phenomenon caused by objective as well as subjective 
factors. However, there are no grounds for saying that anything 
serious has occurred and the situation will be put right before 
the end of the year. 
  Comparing the progress of economic reform in China and 
Russia, the chairman of the Russian Government noted that it was 
similar in many respects. Any differences were explained by 
different potential and different conditions. The PRC is 
pursuing socialist economic reforms, while we are carrying out 
economic reforms that have a social thrust, he said. 
  The reforms in China began earlier and there was no shock 
therapy. In Russia, however, the situation is different. We 
began with shock therapy. It could not be done any other way. 
That much is clear, the prime minister stressed. He believes 
that in future there will be more similarities than differences 
in the implementation of reform in Russia and China. 
  Referring to China's place in Russian foreign policy, 
Chernomyrdin noted that relations between Russia and the PRC 
influence the entire situation in the Asian-Pacific region. I 
do not think that any issues in the Asian-Pacific region could 
be discussed or resolved without the participation of these two 
states, he added. He said that China's growing weight in Asia 
and its' ties with the states of Central Asia did not worry 
Russia at all.

  [Text] Beijing, 29 May -- The visit to China by Viktor 
Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, has been 
completed and he has left the north-eastern Chinese town of 
Dalian for home. A communique on the results of the visit notes 
that it was a complete success. 
  At the meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and talks 
with State Council Premier Li Peng, which were held in a 
friendly, businesslike, and constructive atmosphere, there was 
satisfaction that fruitful cooperation in the political, 
economic, scientific- technical, cultural, military, and 
law-protection spheres had been established. 
  During the Russian prime minister's four-day official visit, 
seven intergovernmental documents were signed and willingness 
was expressed to go on expanding and extending Russian-Chinese 
cooperation in all directions. The parties confirmed their 
commitment to the principles established in the joint 
declaration on the basis of cooperation between Russia and China 
signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Beijing in 
December 1992. They declared their resolve to move their good 
neighborly and amicable interstate links into a new stage of 
development. 
  The parties are firmly convinced that long-term and stable 
relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and mutually 
beneficial cooperation aimed at the 21st century meet the 
fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and are 
an important factor for peace, stability, and development in the 
Asia- Pacific Ocean region and the world as a whole. 
  The further development of Russian-Chinese cooperation in 
trade and the economy and in science and technology occupied a 
central place in the talks and the parties expressed their 
intention to give this greater priority. Since cross-border and 
interregional cooperation is becoming an essential, constituent 
part of these relations, the desire was stressed for cooperation 
in manufacturing and on joint investment projects at regional 
level. 
  Russia and the People's Republic of China also intend to 
develop military-technical links while observing both sides' 
international obligations. 
  There was positive assessment of the Russian-Chinese talks 
on 
border questions and the mutual reduction in the Armed Forces 
and confidence-building measures in the military sphere in the 
border region. Compliance with the spirit and letter of the 
agreement on the state border on its eastern part was 
reaffirmed. The sides intend to continue their talks on 
outstanding problems, and also to intensify preparations for the 
agreement on the Russian-Chinese state border on its western 
part. 
  The importance of reaching an early agreement on a mutual 
reduction in Armed Forces and confidence-building measures in 
the military sphere in the border region was noted at the talks. 
It was felt mutually that the further reaffirmation at the 
border between the two countries of an atmosphere of peace, 
good-neighborliness, and cooperation not only contributes to a 
deepening of mutual trust and mutual understanding in 
Russian-Chinese inter-state relations, but also favors security 
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. 
  During the course of an exchange of opinions between 
Chernomyrdin and the Chinese leadership on questions of the 
socioeconomic changes in Russia and China, the usefulness of 
mutual knowledge of the theory and practice of reforms and 
exchange of experience, with due regard for the specific 
characteristics of the two countries, in order to assist in 
deepening an understanding of the situation in Russia and in 
China, was noted. 
  The document notes the proximity or coincidence of the views 
of the two countries on fundamental international problems and 
their intention to strengthen their multitiered, constructive 
cooperation in regional and world affairs, which is an important 
factor for stability and security in Asia and for the overall 
improvement of the situation in the world. The importance of 
multilateral, economic cooperation in north-east Asia and in the 
Asia-Pacific Ocean region was acknowledged. 
  The parties agreed to maintain and develop active dialogue 
at 
all levels including the highest as they believe that this is of 
great significance for the further expansion of mutual 
understanding and mutual trust and the uninterrupted development 
of good-neighborly and amicable relations and mutually 
advantageous cooperation between Russia and China. 
  On behalf of the Russian Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin 
invited Premier Li Peng to make an official visit to Russia in 
1995.

  [Text] Russia's Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin announced 
that a Russian government delegation's official visit to China 
had failed to settle the problem of mutual debts. He told 
Interfax that China had not repaid Russia the 80 million Swiss 
franc credit, extended to it for the construction of a railway 
(1 dollar equals 1.4 Swiss francs - Interfax). 
  According to the Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic 
Relations, in 1990 the Soviet Union borrowed 0.5 billion Swiss 
francs and in 1991 - 1 billion Swiss francs from China (Russia 
is the Soviet Union's legal successor). Moreover, Russia's debt 
to China for supplies on a clearing basis exceeds 800 million 
Swiss francs. 
  Shokhin said that the sides had not yet evaluated all of the 
mutual debts and claims, and that this work was to be done 
during the next few weeks. 
  To quote Shokhin, "in order to retain an equal attitude to 
all creditors, given the current financial problems and other 
considerations, Russia will have to ask Beijing to put off the 
repayment of the debt on terms similar to the ones advanced by 
the Paris Club. Although China is not a member of the Paris 
Club, if Russia repays its debt to China on more favorable 
terms, Moscow will find itself in a difficult situation on the 
eve of the talks with the Paris Club," Shokhin pointed out. 
  "Without a departure from the barter scheme, which allows a 
couple of Chinese companies to dictate prices and choice of 
goods, we shall fail to keep trade with China on a proper 
level," he continued. 
  He also said that China had promised to give Russian exports 
broader access to the Chinese market.

  [Text] Russia's First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey 
Kokoshin is convinced that the Chinese market is lucrative for 
Moscow and is ready "to consume Russian systems of armaments." 
He told this to Interfax at the end of the talks he conducted 
in Beijing as a member of a Russian Government delegation that 
accompanied Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in his official visit to 
China. 
  Kokoshin explained that the systems of arms available in 
China today had been patterned on Soviet weapon designs. 
  He reported that a contract to sell 26 SU-27 war planes to 
China was already being implemented. He described SU-27 as a 
"good machine, which will apparently be in service until 
2020-2025, under conditions of essential modernization." He 
added that there were plans to equip this fighter plane with new 
on-board arms. 
  He said that his negotiating partner in Beijing was General 
Liu Huangquing, a vice-chairman of China's Central Military 
Council. In Kokoshin's assessment, "military cooperation has 
been going well with close contacts between border military 
districts and extensive delegation exchanges." He revealed that 
the Chinese defense minister is to visit Moscow soon. Chinese 
servicemen are expected at Russian military academies, and 
Russian Army officers are to undergo training in China.

<F P=106> [Interview with ROK President Kim Yong-sam by RIA Novosti </F>
correspondent Sergey Kudasov specially for NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA 
GAZETA in Seoul; date not given: "Eve of Visit: Can You Travel 
From Seoul to Moscow Bypassing Washington?"] 
  [Text] ROK President Kim Yong-sam arrives in Moscow 1 June 
on an official visit. Russian journalists accredited in Seoul 
interviewed the South Korean head of state on the eve of his 
trip. 
  [Kudasov] What is Russia's place in the ROK's "new 
diplomacy" now and in the long term? 
  [Kim] Korea and Russia have become important partners in 
cooperating in various spheres, including the economy, security, 
and culture. That is why I believe that my present visit to 
Moscow will make it possible to strengthen still further the 
relations of friendship between the two countries that have 
developed. If you look at our bilateral relations from the 
historical viewpoint and with consideration for the geographical 
location of the two countries one can say that their role and 
significance will be enhanced in the future. I therefore think 
that they will develop rapidly despite the past associated with 
the Cold War years. 
  I have long wanted to visit Russia without combining this 
visit with trips to other countries since I regard it as 
extremely important. 
  [Kudasov] In your view, what could be the main result of the 
coming summit-level meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin 
in the political sphere and the sphere of bilateral trade and 
economic relations? 
  [Kim] I have already met with B. Yeltsin. I therefore think 
that during our meeting in Moscow we will be able to have an 
open exchange of opinions on various issues. 
  Our summit meeting with the Russian president will primarily 
confirm the fact that constructive partnership, mutually 
complementary relations already exist between our two countries. 
Thanks to talks at summit level the sad past in our relations 
will remain just that and a new era of friendship and 
cooperation will open up instead. 
  President Yeltsin and I will discuss the international 
situation and the situation in the region, along with ways of 
promoting the development of Korean-Russian relations. Thanks 
to the current talks our countries will strengthen their 
cooperation not only as regards stabilizing the situation on the 
Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia, but also as regards 
their activity in the United Nations and in the international 
arena. 
  From the economic viewpoint the Korean-Russian talks will 
serve to strengthen and develop real mutually complementary 
relations geared to the future. 
  [Kudasov] How do you see the situation developing in 
relations between South and North Korea in the near future and 
can you predict with certainty any substantial progress in this 
area, including the possibility of a summit-level meeting with 
DPRK President Kim Il-song? 
  [Kim] As our government has repeatedly stated, given the 
uncertainty over North Korea's nuclear plans no progress can be 
expected in North-South relations. In order to make this 
progress North Korea must first provide the international 
community with clear proof that it is suspending nuclear 
development work. 
  If Kim Il-song does indeed want peace on the Korean 
Peninsula 
he should abandon nuclear development. If he is sincerely 
committed to peace North Korea should enter into direct dialogue 
with the South and should not strive to resolve Korean problems 
via the United States. The cessation of North Korean nuclear 
research is the only way of ensuring peace on the Korean 
Peninsula. 
  Russia has hitherto actively supported our stance on the 
nuclear problem of North Korea and I am counting on that support 
in the future. 
  [Kudasov] Do you not have plans to change your system of 
military cooperation with the United States given your closer 
rapprochement in this sphere with Russia and, in particular, do 
you not have plans to buy arms from the latter? 
  [Kim] Our government's main position is that, in order to 
ease tension on the Korean Peninsula, it is necessary to 
strengthen relations not only with the United States but also 
with any neighboring country. Korean-Russian relations have 
grown even stronger as a result of visits to Russia by the chief 
of the General Staff of our Armed Forces and the defense 
minister and also the Russian defense minister's visit to Korea 
and Russian Navy ships' friendly visits to our ports. 
  In principle I think that the sphere of defense procurements 
can be expanded. However, this question must be given careful 
study on the principle that this output must conform with our 
existing arms systems and their tactical use.

  [Text] Seoul May 30 TASS -- "South Korea is looking forward 
to Russia's assistance in the effort to settle the nuclear 
problem on the Korean peninsula. It will strive to get the 
Russian Government's support to possible U.N. Security Council 
sanctions against the Korean People's Democratic Republic during 
the summit negotiations in Moscow," a representative of the 
presidential chancery, who preferred to remain anonymous, told a 
briefing for foreign journalists here today. 
  He said that the South Korean-Russian summit, which is to 
take place during South Korean President Kim Yong-sam's visit to 
Moscow (from June 1 to June 4), would be of great importance for 
the security of the peninsula. The Seoul leadership is 
disturbed by North Korea's efforts to develop its own nuclear 
weapons. It calls for international measures to influence 
Pyongyang if the latter refused to comply with its commitments 
under the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty. In this 
connection, the support given to this stand by Russia and other 
major powers would be very important for South Korea. 
  The presidential representative noted that the possibility 
of 
Security Council sanctions was growing due to the recent 
replacement of fuel rods in North Korean 5 megawatt nuclear 
reactors without the control of the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA). Kim Yong- sam plans to discuss this problem with 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visit to Moscow and 
to find out what would be Russia's stand in this connection. 
  Commenting on Moscow's proposal to call a multilateral 
conference on the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula with 
the participation of Russia, the United States, Japan, China, 
the Republic of Korea, the Korean People's Democratic Republic, 
and leaders of the United Nations and the IAEA, the South Korean 
president's representatives noted that the Seoul government was 
"carefully studying" the idea. "However," he said, "it is first 
necessary to see how the situation on the peninsula develops 
under the impact of continuing efforts exerted in the same 
direction by the United Nations and the IAEA." 
  During his talks with Boris Yeltsin, the same source 
informed, Kim Yong-sam plans to discuss the terms of the treaty 
of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance, which was 
concluded between the USSR and the Korean People's Democratic 
Republic in 1961. The South Korean side is particularly 
interested to know whether Russia would be inevitably drawn into 
a military conflict if it broke out in Korea. 
  According to the YONHAP news service, a meeting on problems 
of security was held in Seoul today. President Kim Yong-sam 
instructed his government during the meeting to take preparatory 
steps against any surprises linked with the unpredictability of 
Pyongyang's nuclear plans. At the same time, south korea 
reaffirmed during the meeting its intention to continue the 
efforts to overcome the current crisis by peaceful means.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- Disagreements over the 
location of the Russian Embassy in Seoul have lately become one 
of the main irritants in relations between Russia and South 
Korea, Russian high- level sources said on the eve of South 
Korean President Kim Yong- Sam's official visit to Moscow 
beginning on June 1. 
  The sources said that the South Korean Embassy in Moscow is 
located in the prestigious quarters of the city in an excellent 
building, while the Russian diplomats have been provided with a 
building in a poor condition on the outskirts of the city. 
  Additionally, the South Korean authorities have confiscated, 
without ample enough grounds, according to the Russian side, the 
territory previously occupied by the Russian Embassy. "This 
question has a very disappointing side," a high-ranking Russian 
diplomat said. 
  After South Korea established diplomatic relations with 
China, the Russian officials recalled, China received the 
building of the former Taiwanese Embassy in the centre of Seoul 
without any problem. Vietnam was provided with the building 
previously occupied by South Vietnam and only Russia has been 
denied the right to the building which, officials said, had been 
its rightful property since the end of the 19th century.

  [Text] Moscow, May 29 (YONHAP) -- Russia's national 
television Ostankino cancelled airing of the second part of its 
documentary on the Korean war, which had been to be aired 
Saturday afternoon. The program was to be aired from at 3:55 to 
4:25 PM, but shortly before the airing, Ostankino said the 
program was cancelled because of "an unexpected condition." 
Ostankino gave no further explanation, only adding that it will 
later announce the airing time of the program, but informed 
sources here said the program is likely not to be aired. 
  At the first part of the program aired on May 21, Gen. 
Dmitriy Volkogonov, a Russian authority on the Korean war and 
former military adviser to President Boris Yeltsin, clearly 
showed that the Korean war broke out by North Korea's invasion 
of the South. 
  Sources in the Russian press said that North Korea seemed to 
have appealed strongly to the Russian Government, legislature 
and Ostankino on airing of the program and called on them to 
stop airing the second part of the documentary.

  [Text] Pyongyang, 30 May (ITAR-TASS) -- A military 
delegation from Vietnam paid an unannounced visit to the DPRK 
this month. The talks with the North Korean side covered a 
number of issues, primarily the coming visit of the Vietnamese 
defense minister to Pyongyang on 16 June, informed sources told 
ITAR-TASS. The sources said the visit should have taken place 
three days ago but was postponed for undisclosed reasons. 
  The republic's mass media said nothing about the Vietnamese 
military delegation's visit. Local observers believe that the 
sides are also making arrangements for the sale of rifles and 
other arms manufactured in the north of the Korean peninsula. 
  Representatives of the Vietnamese Embassy in North Korea 
denied that a Vietnamese military delegation visited North 
Korea. According to them, the Vietnamese defense minister will 
visit Pyongyang this year as planned earlier, but they declined 
to say what is in the plan.

  [Text] Moscow May 30 TASS -- The equipment of the Kuwaiti 
army with the newest Russian arms which have been demonstrated 
to Kuwaiti military leaders and which will soon begin arriving 
in Kuwait will help increase Kuwait's defence capability, 
Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said. 
  The Russian Defence Ministry will also train specialists to 
operate and maintain Russian military equipment in Kuwait, 
Grachev said at a meeting with visiting Kuwaiti parliament 
chairman Ahmad al-Sa'dun in Moscow on Monday. 
  Kuwait is the first Persian Gulf country to have signed a 
military cooperation agreement with Russia. "Russia strictly and 
consistently observes the spirit of the agreement signed by the 
defence ministers of the two countries on November 29, 1993 in 
Moscow," Grachev said. 
  He used as an example the joint Russian-Kuwaiti military 
exercises which Russia is ready to repeat and military and 
technical cooperation between the two countries. 
  The Russian minister pointed to the similarity of positions 
of the Russian and Kuwaiti leaders on regional and global 
security, including Middle East settlement and the resolution of 
the crisis in Yemen. 
  Grachev welcomed the visit of the Kuwaiti parliamentary 
delegation to Russia as an important event in the development of 
bilateral cooperation, including in the military sphere. 
  Ahmad al-Sa'dun told journalists after the meeting that the 
aim of his visit is to convey the warmest wishes and 
gratefulness of the people of Kuwait for Russia's firm position 
on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 
  He also pointed to the closeness of his views on 
Russian-Kuwaiti military cooperation with Grachev's and said 
that the Kuwaiti parliament fully supported and ratified the 
agreement on military cooperation between the two countries. He 
expressed the confidence that the Russian lawmakers will follow 
suit.

<F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by correspondents </F>
Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others] 
  [Text] The ten-day term within which Russian and Ukrainian 
experts must work out an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet, will 
be counted from May 30 Monday and instead of May 25 Wednesday 
when the talks between the Russian-Ukrainian premiers had been 
completed, a Russian Foreign Ministry official, a participant in 
the talks told Interfax. 
  Referring to an agreement with the Ukrainian party, he 
refused to enumerate the issues on which the parties had failed 
to agree. "We keep our word if we give it. Unfortunately, this 
cannot be said about some members of the Ukrainian delegation," 
he remarked mentioning the leakage of information on unsettled 
issues in Kiev. 
  Commenting on possible introduction of direct presidential 
rule in Crimea, the diplomat suggested that the Crimean problem 
could not be solved just by administrative measures. 
  "It is possible to dismiss the Crimean parliament unwilling 
to cede to the pressure exercised by Kiev and thus to gain 
political capital before the presidential elections. However, 
this will not resolve the Crimean problems," the diplomat 
underlined. 
  He said that the Russian Foreign Ministry and other Russian 
organizations were receiving more and more letters from Russians 
living in Ukraine. They were complaining about the arbitrary 
rule exercised by the local authorities which were carrying out 
forceful "Ukranization," the diplomat stressed. He said that 
this was not in conformity with democratic principles and values 
in fidelity to which Kiev had sworn. 
  In an interview with Interfax a former Soviet human rights' 
activist, now the head of the department for international 
humanitarian and cultural cooperation at the Russian Foreign 
Ministry Vyacheslav Bakhmin has said that the introduction of 
presidential rule in Crimea can freeze the situation at best, 
even though that is hardly likely. 
  In his opinion extraordinary regulations will not resolve 
the 
problems of Crimea. They should be resolved at the political 
level through a dialogue and mutual concessions. From a 
diplomatic point of view Crimea constitutes an internal problem 
of Ukraine and Russia's active interference would be 
counter-productive, Bakhmin said. 
  The diplomat believes that the idea of holding a referendum 
on separation from Ukraine in Crimea has not future. In 
principle CSCE permits such a possibility, but the example of 
Karabakh shows how the principle works in real life politics. 
It works poorly causing much bloodshed. 
  In Bakhmin's opinion the introduction of dual citizenship 
can 
hardly resolve all Crimean problems. "Dual citizenship can 
change the psychological condition of a man but it can hardly 
influence his actual position, he said. An agreement on dual 
citizenship implies the principle of effective citizenship, i.e. 
the citizenship of the country in which the person lives at the 
moment. The other citizenship "sleeps" meanwhile. It "wakes 
up" when the person moves to the country of his second 
citizenship." 
  The diplomat is convinced that problems similar to the 
Crimean one and related to the rights of nations or big groups 
of people can be resolved only on the basis of respect for human 
rights not just the rights of nations. The rights of nations 
are secondary compared to human rights, Bakhmin stressed.

  [Text] Donetsk May 27 TASS -- At their meeting in Donetsk 
today, leaders of frontier regions of Russia and Ukraine adopted 
a number of documents which will regulate economic and cultural 
cooperation between regions. 
  Representatives of the Rostov, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh and 
Belgorod regions of russia, and the Kharkov, Lugansk, Sumy, 
Chernigov and Donetsk regions of Ukraine have established an 
executive committee of the council of leaders of frontier 
regions and elected co-chairmen. During the first year the work 
of the executive committee will be coordinated by Vasiliy 
Ryabykh, head of the department in the administration of the 
Belgorod region. 
  One of the main documents signed by participants in the 
meeting is a package of proposals on inserting amendments in 
standard acts of the two states regulating frontier relations. 
  The status of frontier regions envisages real business 
cooperation between neighboring regions. On the basis of this 
document import and export of industrial commodities 
manufactured there and intended for the use at plants located in 
neighboring regions, must be exempted from customs duties and 
taxes. 
  Participants in the meeting also discussed the mechanism for 
the implementation of the Ukrainian president's decree "on 
measures on the development of economic cooperation among 
regions of Ukraine and frontier regions of the Russian 
Federation" which provides for the possibility for students of 
one republic to study in educational establishments of the other 
republic. It was noted at the meeting that positive experience 
in this field was accumulated, for instance, by the Rostov and 
Donetsk regions which are carrying out the exchange of students. 
  The meeting also considered a question of setting up an 
association of economic cooperation called the 
"Russian-Ukrainian Union". 
  However, participants in the meeting stressed that all these 
documents just as cooperation between separate regions of the 
contiguous states would remain only good wishes if the 
aspiration for neighborliness was not legalized by corresponding 
inter-state acts. In this connection participants in the 
meeting appealed to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to 
speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on friendship, 
cooperation and partnership between the two states.

policy will be set out today by Boris Yeltsin at a conference of 
top commanders of the Russian border troops. On the eve of the 
president's address the deputy commanders-in-chief of the 
Russian border troops and commanders of border districts and 
groups were presented to him. 
  On arrival at border troops headquarters, Yeltsin said he 
intended to discuss with border troops the complex tasks facing 
the defenders of the Russian border. The president spoke of the 
need to organize a new system for the protection of borders with 
the Baltic republics, the Transcaucasus, and other states of the 
CIS. 
  Yeltsin stressed that, in accordance with Russia's new 
constitution, it was necessary to improve the legislative basis 
for the activities of border forces and departments that 
cooperate with them.

  [Text] Kiev, 28 May -- The Crimean leadership's position 
will damage "Ukraine's goodneighborly relations with Russia, 
which have always been, and still are, the determining factor in 
spite of everything," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk 
believes. The Ukrainian head of state said this at the end of 
his one-day visit to Chernobyl AES [nuclear power station] and 
to the power workers' town of Slavutich. "The leaders of the 
Crimean Republic say they want to be a bridge between Ukraine 
and Russia, but in fact they are laying a `mine' under this 
bridge," the president said. 
  Leonid Kravchuk believes that there are forces that are 
doing 
this consciously, and there are also those who are laying this 
`mine' because they can see no civilized way to resolve the 
problem" [no open quotation marks as received]. "They have an 
arsenal of rallies and slogans," he added. At the same time, 
the president voiced the hope that "common sense will prevail 
among those who are disregarding the laws and Constitution of 
Ukraine and the universally acknowledged principles of the world 
community." 
  The president thinks "no one has the right to cross over the 
`red' line in pursuit of ambitions. If anyone goes this far, we 
will take decisive and consistent action, but within the 
framework of the Constitution. There is no other way." There 
is only one way: To resolve all problems peacefully in 
accordance with the law, Leonid Kravchuk emphasized. 
  He also issued a warning to those who strive to achieve 
their 
own parochial interests. The president stressed: There are 
enough forces in Ukraine to neutralize those who "resort to 
unlawful actions." He stressed at the same time that he will 
not permit any infringement of the principles of goodneighborly 
relations with Russia.

  [Text] Kiev, 27 May -- Ukrainian Presidential Aide Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko has denied Russian media reports about a statement 
he is supposed to have made on the possibility of introducing 
presidential rule to Crimea. In an exclusive interview with 
ITAR-TASS today, he said that on 31 May, the Ukrainian Supreme 
Soviet may resume debating the Crimean question as the 10-day 
deadline for bringing the Crimean constitution into line with 
that of Ukraine, as set by the Ukrainian Parliament, is running 
out. 
  "It is impossible to predict today what decisions the 
Supreme 
Soviet will take or to talk about specific steps," Nikolay 
Mikhalchenko said. At the same time, he added that "Ukrainian 
legislature does not provide for introducing presidential rule. 
Therefore, anyone who talks about it is deliberately tricking 
the public."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol, 30 May -- Deputies of the Crimean 
Parliament have decided at the sittings of their commissions 
that there are no grounds for rescinding their decision on 
restoring the main points of the 1992 Constitution, which 
provides for setting up a Crimean statehood and building 
Crimea's relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties. An 
ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this from Viktor Mezhak, deputy 
chairman of the Crimean Parliament. 
  Today is the deadline of the 10-day period during which, at 
the demand of the Ukrainian Parliament, the Crimean Supreme 
Council was to have brought the Crimean Constitution into 
agreement with the Ukrainian Constitution currently in force and 
with the law on the division of powers between the state power 
bodies of the two republics. 
  Mezhak said that common sense should prevail at the session 
of the Ukrainian Supreme Council, which is opening tomorrow [31 
May], and that the Ukrainian Parliament should not empower the 
president of Ukraine to "act stupidly" with regard to Crimea, as 
he called it. All the more so, he said, that not a single 
statement in the restored Constitution violates territorial 
integrity or leads to existing borders being redrawn because, 
under the Constitution, Crimea remains part of Ukraine. 
However, it would henceforth develop its relations with Ukraine 
on the basis of treaties and agreements through delegating power. 
  According to the deputy chairman of the Crimean Parliament, 
a 
working group is to be formed from deputies of the Ukrainian 
Supreme Council and it is to come to Sevastopol no later than 
Friday [3 June] in order to continue the talks previously held 
in Kiev. 
  Mezhak said the situation in Crimea is reasonably quiet and 
there are no grounds for concern. However, in his opinion, 
attempts to destabilize it from the outside depress people and 
introduce a note of anxiety into their everyday life and work.

<F P=106> [Viktor Yadukha report from Simferopol in the "Peninsula" </F>
column: "Crimean Parliament Shows Its Teeth to the President. 
Half the Peninsula's Population Awaits Action from Meshkov"] 
  [Text] The Crimean Supreme Council session which has just 
opened showed that, despite ideological common ground with the 
parliamentary majority, President Yuriy Meshkov has failed to 
avoid traditional friction with people's deputies. 
  After the session formed a working group on further talks 
with Kiev on the fate of the Crimean constitution the deputies 
went ahead with discussing the cabinet structure. The 
president's proposal to cut the apparatus of the ministries of 
culture, education, and public health by merging them into a 
social security ministry was rejected out of hand by the Supreme 
Council. Yet more important for the head of state was the 
confirmation of eight candidates from the Yevgeniy Saburov team 
who so far are only acting ministers. 
  Addressing parliament, Mr. Saburov stated that Crimea has 
turned out to be not ready to rectify the "twisted economic 
relations" amid plummeting demand. The vice premier sees an 
answer in attracting foreign investments and swifter 
privatization and reform in general. 
  This did not please the deputies who do not trust in the 
possibility of legal privatization while regarding calls for 
wide investments as attempts by "Moscow Varangians" to sell off 
the peninsula to foreigners. The house jeered and called for a 
concrete plan of action. It was in vain that Mr. Meshkov tried 
to remind the deputies about former cooperation, asking to 
confirm his men. The cabinet opponents were joined by communist 
and Crimean Tatar factions, with the result that the ministers 
were not approved. Meshkov, Saburov, and the government walked 
out of the house. 
  Meanwhile, the popularity rating of Meshskov, who not so 
long 
ago scored a fairly convincing victory in elections, is falling. 
According to the Crimean Social Studies Center, only 12 percent 
of the respondents fully approve of the president's performance; 
18 percent support it; the same proportion of respondents say 
they have never trusted him; and 43 percent want action from him.

<F P=106> [Nikolay Semena report: "Ye. Saburov Has Problems with </F>
Crimean Parliament"] 
  [Text] Sevastopol -- On 26 May the Crimean parliament 
deferred the adoption of a decision on the formation of the 
republic's government. Yu. Meshkov called this the third 
government crisis in the Crimea. 
  After submitting to the Crimean Supreme Soviet a report on 
the program for a solution to the crisis, Vice Premier Ye. 
Saburov came under the fiercest criticism from the deputies. 
Deputy V. Balla, chairman of the parliamentary economy 
commission, called his speech "an economics lecture for 
first-year students." Doubts were voiced about the report's 
provisions on the role of the banks in the Crimean economy and 
its view of privatization. Moreover, he was accused of lacking 
confidence in local cadres of leaders and specialists, of 
inactivity, and of not being in charge of the situation. Deputy 
V. Shevza proposed that he seize the initiative and draft his 
own program for a way out of the crisis instead of the 
government. Deputies demanded that a law on the government be 
submitted to the Supreme Council session first, then its concept 
and structure, and only after that should personnel appointments 
be made. 
  Crimean President Yu. Meshkov tried to convince deputies of 
the need for the earliest possible solution of the question of 
the government and asked that, in accordance with the results of 
an opinion poll among inhabitants of the Crimea, he be empowered 
to issue edicts with the force of law and form a government on 
the basis of the structure envisaged by an edict already issued. 
Yu. Meshkov said that the deputies' criticism of Ye. Saburov 
was unethical and premature because there is no government as 
such yet. Ye. Saburov himself also considered this criticism 
wrong because he said that it was biased, uninformed, and 
expressed from the Ukrainian Government's standpoint. He 
described how at the meeting in Moscow "the wise Ye. Zvyagilskiy 
had advised him not to sever ties with his institution once and 
for all." 
  The deputies, however, with the active participation of the 
"Russia" bloc, did not support the president and deferred the 
question on the government. After that, deputy L. Krasnovskaya 
announced that she was leaving the "Russia" bloc, and Yu. 
Meshkov, Ye. Saburov, and all the candidates for ministerial 
posts ostentatiously left the hall. 
  After examining the results of the talks in Kiev on the fate 
of the constitution, the Crimean Supreme Council elected its 
part of the general working group, which included five deputies. 
It also recommended that several specialists be invited to take 
part in its work. As for the agreed suspension of the law on 
the restoration of the constitution, the Crimean deputies 
decided not to do that for the time being but to return to the 
question later. 
  Here are further details on one event. 
  At 1600 hours on 24 May, the Sevastopol militia discovered 
two home-made explosive devices made from TNT cartridges 
weighing in total 5.2 kg, plus six detonators and 36 meters of 
fuse wire which had been hidden near a bridge across the 
Fiolentovskoye Highway. 
  Later that night a suspicious individual was detained near 
the same place as he was attempting to throw an object away into 
the darkness. A search revealed this object to be a revolver. 
The detainee was searched and more fuse wire was found, 
identical to that found together with the concealed explosive 
device. 
  The detained man was Veniamin Demin, a retired officer who 
hails from Moscow. He used to be a miner in a special-purpose 
team in Nikolayev Oblast. Back in December 1993 he was ordered 
to leave his permanent place of residence in Ochakov and go back 
to Moscow. 
  Competent organs have confirmed the discovery and the 
detention. It is believed that the detained man worked for a 
mafia grouping and that his mission was to commit an act of 
terrorism, but other motives have not been ruled out. An 
investigation is in progress.

  [Text] The Crimean leadership's goal is economic 
independence, not Ukraine's breakup, the Crimean president's top 
aide Vladimir Karpov told Interfax on Monday. He said that 
Crimea would welcome relations with Kiev similar to relations 
between Russia and Tatarstan. 
  Meanwhile, Kiev has stated on many occasions that unlike 
Russia, Kiev was a unitary state and that the conclusion of such 
an agreement would go against the Ukrainian laws. 
  Commenting on some of the Ukrainian politicians' plans to 
introduce direct presidential rule in Crimea, Karpov said that 
the implementation of such a plan would be unfair. He admitted, 
however, that the Crimean parliament's decision to restore the 
1992 Constitution had been taken in haste. He noted that on the 
eve of the decision-making, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov had 
urged the deputies to put the decision off at least until autumn. 
  Crimea's restored constitution provides for treaty-based 
relations with Ukraine and for the Crimean citizens' right to 
dual citizenship. 
  Karpov believes that a commission of Crimean deputies and 
their Ukrainian colleagues could settle all the disputable 
issues. He also expressed the hope that a Ukrainian 
parliamentary delegation's forthcoming visit to Crimea would 
help ease tensions. 
  "Crimea is always ready for compromise. The Crimean deputies 
have a good command of the language of compromise and 
diplomacy," said Karpov.

  [Text] Kiev [no dateline as received] -- A UNIAN 
correspondent learned on 27 May that Ukrainian Interior Minister 
Andriy Vasylyshyn has sent a letter addressed to President 
Kravchuk, Acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy, and Supreme Council 
chairman Oleksandr Moroz. The letter particularly notes that in 
connection with the complex crime situation on the peninsula, 
Ukraine's Interior Ministry is taking additional measures 
towards stabilizing it. In particular, the ministry has 
instructed the heads of interior bodies in the Crimea to adhere 
strictly to the law of Ukraine "on the militia" and not to allow 
illegal actions, which inexperienced politicians and Valeriy 
Kuznetsov can depend on. Ukraine's interior minister has 
consulted with Russian Interior Minister Yerin on these issues. 
  The letter also notes that Kuznetsov is intensifying the 
atmosphere of confrontation. In particular, he banned the heads 
of the Crimea's interior bodies from giving permission for a 
meeting between Ukraine's Interior Ministry employees with the 
personnel [presumably of the Crimea's interior bodies]. "The 
complexity of the crime situation in the Crimea and the adoption 
by Valeriy Kuznetsov of unprofessional decisions compels 
Ukraine's Interior Ministry to keep a small number (30 persons) 
of unarmed employees from the apparatus of Ukraine's Interior 
Ministry directly in the Crimea," the letter notes. 
  On 28 May a senior official in Ukraine's Interior Ministry, 
who wished to remain anonymous, commented on the situation at 
the request of a UNIAN correspondent, noting that "after the 
election of Yuriy Meshkov as president of the Crimea, it was 
expected that a conflict would emerge between him and Oleksandr 
Plyuta, Crimea's interior minister, who refused to implement a 
decree by Yuriy Meshkov that ran counter to Ukraine's current 
legislation. But the arrival of Valeriy Kuznetsov, a person 
from Yuriy Meshkov's entourage, on the scene as well as his 
attempt to resubordinate to himself a Berkut detachment, made 
the situation more complicated. Understanding that the situation 
was becoming more acute, Andriy Vasylyshyn has been trying to 
contact Yuriy Meshkov, but he has left his telephone calls and 
letters unanswered. 
  "Ukraine's Interior Ministry, while striving to avoid an 
escalation of tension, contemplated the possibility of 
confirming Valeriy Kuznetsov as Crimea's interior minister. But 
by his actions, he has proved himself not only unprofessional 
but also dangerous. He has himself ended up as a hostage to the 
situation. 
  "Having exhausted all possibilities, Ukraine's Interior 
Ministry has appealed to President Kravchuk with a request that 
he make use of his right as commander in chief and resubordinate 
the Crimea's armed militia detachment to Ukraine's Interior 
Ministry. As a result, the main interior directorate of Crimea 
of Ukraine's Ministry Interior was formed, which was headed by 
Valeriy Chernyshov. The events in the Crimea have shown that 
Valeriy Kuznetsov and the people who direct him are trying to 
play the Crimean card according to this very scenario, but we 
have managed to achieve a certain improvement of the situation 
through personal contacts and explanations too."

<F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>
  [Text] Simferopol May 27 TASS -- The decree of Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk to reorganize the Crimean security 
service into the Ukrainian security service's main department in 
the Crimea and subordinate it directly to Kiev "is illegal in 
all respects," Chairman of the Crimean Security Service Vladimir 
Lepikhov told ITAR-TASS today. 
  In his opinion, the decree will not help to raise the 
efficiency of the department or ensure security of the 
law-governed democratic Crimean Republic. 
  Judging by official statements of the Ukrainian side, the 
Ukrainian Security Service does nothing to destabilize situation 
in the Crimea, said the service chairman. At the same time, 
movement of materiel and deployment of hospitals claimed by Kiev 
as an arrangement planned for the first half of the year run 
counter to the striving to preserve tranquility in the Crimea 
and give grounds to mass media for stirring up tension. The 
ongoing reinforcement of the Ukrainian National Guard units in 
the Crimea both with materiel and personnel does the same. 
  All these steps provoke concern of Crimean residents, 
parliament deputies and republican heads, said Lepikhov. It 
would be better to abstain from these actions or change their 
form, he added. 
  In the opinion of Lepikhov, the only civilized way out is 
boosted negotiations with the Crimea. The intensive dialogue 
should aim to settle disputable issues related to the restored 
validity of the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992, 
coordination of this decision with Ukraine at all levels, and 
conclusion of corresponding treaties and agreements and 
delegation of powers. All efforts should aim to reach a 
consensus, he stressed.

subordination to the Ukrainian leadership and expressed their 
willingness for close cooperation with the leaders of Crimea

directorate in Crimea to the Crimean president and parliament

<F P=106> ["Excerpt" of Interview with Yevhen Marchuk, minister of </F>
state for the Ukrainian National Security Service, by 
unidentified correspondent on 26 May; place not given -- 
originally carried on Ukrainian television program "Pravo"] 
  [Text] [Correspondent] Yevhen Kyrylovych, my colleagues 
and some politicians have immediately rushed, in my opinion, 
into christening the developments in Crimea to be an acute 
crisis, as it were. Does this in your view as a professional 
correspond with reality and how does the Security Service feel 
in the present situation in Crimea? 
  [Marchuk] In spite of the atmosphere there in this episode 
in 
particular and that surrounding the service -- the former 
security service of Crimea -- in general, the people we are 
working with are high-standard professionals, rather than 
(?hysterical) nervous wrecks, which is why situations like this, 
as they say, do not make us feel at a loss. To date, the 
National Security Service of Ukraine has fulfilled the 
requirements of Ukrainian President Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk's 
directive of 18 May on reforming the Crimean security service 
and setting up on the basis of that service the Security Service 
of Ukraine Main Directorate in Crimea. 
  The president in this particular case exercised his 
constitutional right. In accordance with Article 114.5, the 
president as a guarantor of the Constitution, territorial 
integrity, and national security, has the right to reorganize -- 
I would like to emphasize that this is exactly what that article 
in the Constitution points out -- to create, reorganize, and 
disband various executive power establishments such as 
ministries, departments, and so on. The security service is a 
branch of executive power and it is exactly on the basis of 
those requirements in that article of the Constitution that the 
reorganization was carried out. 
  What does it mean? It means that a Security Service of 
Ukraine subdivision is in action in Crimea. It functional 
duties, structure, and numerical strength, however, have not 
been altered. I, incidentally, informed Crimean President 
Meshkov about this in writing in a telegram. And secondly... 
  [Correspondent] As for -- I beg your pardon -- as for the 
accusations that the Security Service of Ukraine and its 
subdivisions in Crimea are now pursuing an anti-Crimean policy 
and engaging in anti-Crimean activities, can you respond to 
these accusations and can you say if they conform to reality? 
  [Marchuk] This, as they say, is a preplanned misinformation 
because, as I have already said, neither the functional duties 
nor the structure or the numerical strength of this subdivision 
have been changed. And the priority tasks of this subdivision 
remain as they were before: to combat corruption, organized 
crime, protect the economy, and protect civil peace in Crimea. 
However, at present, unfortunately, by virtue of the 
circumstances which are now taking place in Crimea we had to 
slightly shift emphasis and give priority to carrying out the 
work which is necessary to ensure civil peace and ease tensions 
in society. And, without fail, one of our principal tasks is to 
provide the bodies of power with information... 
  [Correspondent] By the way, I would like to ask you how does 
the Security Service build relations with the local 
administration? 
  [Marchuk] ...today -- I have not completed the sentence -- 
to 
provide the bodies of power with information about the most 
vital problems of Crimea, as, by the way, is the case with all 
our territorial subdivisions. In this respect we changed 
nothing. As we were providing information before, the Main 
Directorate of the Ukrainian Security Service in Crimea now 
informs the leading bodies of Crimea in writing, both the 
president and the Supreme Council, about issues which, even at a 
local level, the issues which are of vital importance for Crimea. 
  Two written reports of this kind have been made today. In 
all, a few reports have been made in the last few days since 18 
May when the status of the [Crimean] security service was 
changed and it was reorganized. 
  Because there is a very large number of various 
insinuations, 
I would like to emphasize and to some extent explain why the 
president of Ukraine took that decision. You know that a 
decision of that kind was also taken in relation to Internal 
Affairs Ministry structures, but I would only like to speak on 
the security service. 
The thing is that the Crimean leadership made two attempts, 
unilaterally and without any coordination with Kiev. The first 
one was the attempt to give the chair of the head of the 
Security Service of Crimea to a former or retired military 
general who had been chief of staff of the XXXII Army Corps. 
But in compliance with our law, the security service of Crimea, 
as all territorial bodies, is a constituent part of the single 
security system, which is, by the way, the case with all 
countries, even federative ones. Then the second attempt. 
  [Correspondent] A relevant militarization, so to say, of the 
power-wielding structures. Am I right? 
  [Marchuk] Yes, you are right. To be more precise and to 
compare the two actions, the first one being the appointment of 
the former commander of the XXXII Army Corps minister of 
internal affairs by the president of Crimea and then by the 
Supreme Council [of Crimea], and then the attempts to give, as I 
have already said, the chair of the chief of the Security 
Service of Ukraine to the former chief of staff of this XXXII 
Army Corps; that is to say, he is also a former military 
general. And it became clear that the leadership of Crimea was 
embarking on the road of militarization of the power-wielding 
structures; that is, these former, retired generals, as it had 
probably been planned, were supposed to establish order in 
Crimea. 
  You can understand what it means when generals in retirement 
establish order on such a small territory as the Crimean 
autonomous region. No great deal of forecasting need be made 
here, as they say, because it is already known what kind of 
heroic deeds have now been undertaken by the internal affairs 
minister as a result of his unprofessional actions, which he 
himself, incidentally, admitted saying that he was not a 
professional (?in that field). 
  [Correspondent] Once we have started disproving rumors and 
some unverified information, can you refute reports by some of 
the media on spetsnaz troops being deployed in Crimea, on 
bringing National Guard units to full combat alert, and so on, 
as the list is endless? And incidentally, as a professional, 
what in your view are these allegations aimed at? 
  [Marchuk] Before I answer this question I would like to 
underline, and I want all citizens of Ukraine to know this, 
first and foremost those who reside in Crimea: The Security 
Service of Ukraine as a whole and all its subdivisions and the 
Main Directorate of the Security Service in Crimea -- I am 
saying this with absolute responsibility and officially -- is 
one of the factors of stabilization of the situation in Crimea. 
  I have already said that we had to do and we now have to do 
much, even here in Kiev, so as to neutralize and alleviate the 
situation in Crimea. I will provide the following example. 
  Quite often I speak with various Crimean leaders, including 
president Meshkov, and so on. But most often I have to talk 
with the Black Sea Fleet commander Eduard Dmytrievich Baltin, 
because you understand that such a gigantic military structure 
is stationed there and the situation in Crimea will very much 
depend on how it behaves. 
  During one of our conversations he complained: Yevgeniy 
Kirilovich, you understand, how should I, as a serviceman, as 
the one responsible for the fleet, perceive this, for example, 
report that in the vicinity of some village in Kherson Oblast a 
hospital is being deployed to receive those wounded by shrapnel, 
that in the vicinity of some village in Odessa oblast a hospital 
is being deployed, allegedly the hospital of the Odessa military 
district is being deployed according to a war-time scale, that 
attacks are being prepared against the Black Sea Fleet riverine 
brigade's ships in Izmail. 
  It took me no more than 20 minutes to immediately give the 
task to our directorates in Odessa and Kherson and to the 
military counter-intelligence and then to contact the minister 
of defense, Radetskyy, to clear up in 20 minutes that this is an 
outright lie -- excuse me for this word. But someone is 
bringing it to the knowledge of the Black Sea Fleet commander. 
  Incidentally, you and we are in a way colleagues in that, 
being professionals, both you and we operate primarily on the 
basis of information. It seems to me, however, that that 
information has a somewhat specific character and just a 
journalist without a prompt from a specialist would simply not 
be able to present or invent it. This is someone being used as a 
mouthpiece and the mass media have spread this misinformation 
with a particular aim. But what is this aim, (?I would like to 
ask)? 
  After that conversation with Baltin, tension was eased, as 
it 
were. I, by the way, had some information too. 
  [Correspondent] As a challenge? 
  [Marchuk] As a challenge. I had some information about a 
plane from Moscow, incidentally with a spetsnaz group on board 
too, flying towards one of his airfields. As officials, I trust 
Baltin and he trusts me. We may withhold something from each 
other but I do not think we could tell untruths. At least I do 
not do this. 
  So literally within 20 to 30 minutes we disposed of much of 
the information that was causing tension. Some two-and-a-half 
to three hours later, however, with a map and a sound 
accompaniment on top of it all, and I am told by our staff in 
Crimea about whom this all benefits and who presents this 
information this way. 
  From the point of view of a professional, all this, 
unfortunately, is very simple: All this is qualified as 
information of a purposeful nature, popularly known as 
misinformation or, in even simpler terms, a lie. It is 
presented, however, at a certain moment in time, in a certain 
way and on a certain territory in order to -- it is aimed at 
something after all -- to cause tension, intimidate, for 
example, the Crimean leadership by saying: "You see what is 
happening" and push someone towards some careless or even, 
forgive me, hysterical actions. 
  However, unfortunately, those who were organizing this 
so-called help to Crimea, those who thought they were helping 
it, they did grave harm to Crimea. Very many applications from 
other countries have been withdrawn by today. I do not know 
exactly how many. 
  [Correspondent] Up to 15,000 according to information 
available to me. 
  [Marchuk] I believe the losses suffered by Crimea will 
amount 
to hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions due to this 
very information. It was spread all over the world. It was 
spread all over the CIS countries. We already know that foreign 
companies from the CIS countries cancelled many routes and tours. 
  So as they say, it was quite excessive, ostensibly 
endeavoring to achieve a noble goal but at the same time, I 
think, harming Crimea primarily by creating an atmosphere of 
quite serious tension, if not a panic, and, secondly, 
frightening off the people whose stay there could have generated 
some revenues to the local budget. 
  [Correspondent] That is, to the detriment of their own? 
  [Marchuk] Mainly to the detriment of Crimea, rather than 
that 
of their own as they are not in Crimea. I think that there is a 
way out of it after all but everyone should cool down, as they 
say, and realize it is they themselves who are responsible for 
their decisions.

<F P=106> ["Declaration of the Republic Committee of the Communist </F>
Party of Crimea"] 
  [Text] The Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea has 
reinstated the validity of certain provisions of the Republic of 
Crimea Constitution of 6 May 1992, thereby providing a pretext 
for interpreting this step as a premise for violation of the 
territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
  While understanding the motives guiding the people's 
deputies, the Republic Committee of the Communist Party of 
Crimea nonetheless considers it its duty to declare that this 
step contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine and generally 
recognized principles of international law, providing 
dishonorable politicians an opportunity to stir up conflict. 
This is exactly what has prompted the sense of alert with which 
the world is following the development of events around the 
peninsula. 
  However, something else is also drawing attention. Why is it 
precisely right now that Crimea is surrounded with such 
attention? 
  The president of Ukraine has long been attempting to 
postpone 
the elections of the president and local councils. Rumors 
persistently abound regarding the incapacity of the new Supreme 
Council of Ukraine, on the possible introduction of presidential 
rule, and then--on elimination of the very system of councils as 
organs of true sovereignty of the people. 
  Those who would like to see this have placed their hopes in 
a 
breakdown of the elections of the Supreme Council of Ukraine. 
Not only did the elections take place, however--they also 
constituted in essence a universal referendum which the 
president has always avoided (contrary to the demands of the 
miners) and which in fact condemned the course of the Ukrainian 
leadership to one of self-isolation and severed ties with Russia 
and other CIS countries, though in words there is no shortage of 
oaths testifying to the benefit of such ties. 
  Is this not why the presidents of Russia and Ukraine 
urgently 
needed (just as was the case during the "conflict" in Odessa 
prior to the second round of voting in the elections to the 
Supreme Council of Ukraine) to tie into a single knot the 
boycott by national-democrats of the functioning of the Supreme 
Council of Ukraine, the tension surrounding Crimea, the resolute 
declarations of ministers of defense and politicians, and the no 
less haughty and disdainful utterances of B. Yeltsin "warning" 
the Ukrainian president? Here they were counting on providing 
the president of Ukraine a "pretext" for the introduction of 
presidential rule and for postponing the elections of the 
president and local councils. And on the president being able to 
"save face" in this regard, "basing" this step on the highest 
interests--the preservation of peace and tranquility in Ukraine 
and in the world. 
  A dishonest game, a hypocritical position that can lead to 
bloodshed--this is the price of that "anxiety" over the 
situation in Crimea we hear resounding in speeches in Kiev and 
Moscow, in the calls to "stand up for Crimea" that are ringing 
out in response on the peninsula itself. 
  We turn to the deputies of the Supreme Councils of Crimea 
and 
Ukraine, and to political parties and movements, with the 
following appeal: Realize in whose hands you may turn out to be 
a tool, though guided by the finest motives. We call upon you 
not to provide any pretext for canceling the elections of the 
president and local councils in Ukraine. For if these elections 
are not held, it will be a victory for reactionary forces. A 
victory the consequences of which will be tragic for the fate of 
social justice, democracy, and the striving to unite the peoples 
of all fraternal republics! 
  People, be vigilant!

<F P=106> [Captain 1st Rank Pasyakin report in the "News from the </F>
Regions" column: "Hryvna Advancing; Coupon in Rapid Retreat"] 
  [Text] Sevastopol -- Following the deterioration in the 
situation in Crimea, a meeting took place in Sevastopol of 
representatives of various parties and movements which created 
the National Front "Sevastopol-Fleet-Russia." Crimean Supreme 
Soviet deputy Aleksandr Kruglov has been elected its chairman. 
  Political instability is leading to economic instability. 
The U.S. dollar, the West German mark, and the Russian ruble 
have surged in value. Dollar bills are being bought at the rate 
of $1 per 50,000 karbovanets. Large-denomination Russian bank 
notes (they are especially valued) go at 1:25. The people, 
repeatedly cheated by the state and "fed" by rumors about the 
introduction of the Ukrainian hryvna, are actively dumping 
coupons and sweeping everything off the shelves.

  [Text] Sevastopol [no dateline as received] -- The press 
center of the Naval Forces of Ukraine reported on 28 May that 
the brigade of the Black Sea Fleet river ships stationed in 
Izmail was brought to full combat readiness. The personnel on 
the motorboats and bases on shore received weapons and 
bullet-proof vests. Six motorboats carrying full loads of fuel 
and food were moved into battle formation. Urgent training was 
conducted at the commandant's office, which was put under the 
protection of military guards. Devices were dismantled on the 
reserve motorboats and on shore, and a reserve weapons firing 
system was wrecked. These actions were the result of a possible 
order on the transfer of the motorboats to the Sea of Azov. 
According to the Ukrainian Naval Forces press center, the order 
to bring the brigade to full combat readiness was issued by its 
commander, Captain 2d Rank V. Belenko, who was not sober at the 
time. 
  According to information provided by the Ukrainian Naval 
Forces press center, the fleet command is concerned about the 
developments in Izmail, which could have led to unpredictable 
consequences. The command of Ukraine's Naval Forces expressed 
the hope that the Black Sea Fleet command would be able to 
control the situation in its subordinate units and formations 
and would do everything possible to make the division of the 
fleet peaceful.

  [Text] The generator of power unit No. 1 at Khmelnitskiy 
nuclear plant was disconnected for several hours. The plant 
information center reports that this was caused by false 
activation of the modular transformer containment system due to 
a short circuit in the control cable conductors. The generating 
set was reconnected upon the removal of the defect. The 
conditions of the plant's safe operation were not affected. The 
radiation situation is unchanged.

<F P=106> [Unscheduled interview with A.A. Moroz, chairman of the </F>
Ukrainian Supreme Council, by unidentified correspondent; date 
and place not given -- recorded] 
  [Text) [Unidentified correspondent] Oleksandr 
Oleksandrovich, perhaps the only serious result -- from the 
public viewpoint -- achieved in the three weeks that the new 
Supreme Council has been working is that it has managed to 
extinguish the fire of conflict with the Crimea which nearly 
flared up. You are going there on a visit. What is the purpose 
of your visit, and what are the Supreme Council's and your own 
future plans as regards this matter? 
  [Moroz] Talking about the Crimean issue, this situation has 
brought people, including the deputies, into a state of 
agitation. When considering this question they have shown their 
maturity, an ability to make compromises and tolerance; they 
have taken into account the interests of the other side, or 
rather of different sides. 
  I have recently spoken to many leaders in the Crimea, 
Ukraine, and Russia, and it seems to me that the conflict can be 
brought to a less intense level. We can find a solution to 
which all would agree. I hope to be able to fly to the Crimea 
next week. I know many residents of the Crimea and will have 
meetings with many representatives of the power structures, with 
the military, and with officials in charge of economic matters, 
and I hope that we will be able to find a reasonable way of 
resolving the issue, which would take into account both the 
interests of the Crimean people and of Ukraine. I think the 
interests of the peoples of Russia will not be ignored, either. 
It seems to me that this is the only way -- to settle all 
disagreements through talks. 
  [Correspondent] How important at the present stage are the 
talks on the future of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol? 
  [Moroz] We do not regard this as a separate issue. Here a 
very important condition is necessary -- that both sides should 
be willing to resolve the problem and not to drive it into an 
impasse. It appears to me that some solutions to this already 
exist. There are many issues here which should be settled in a 
principled and determined way, keeping the main purpose in mind 
-- that we should remain good neighbors forever. I think if we 
continue our work in this mood -- the Crimeans, Ukrainians, and 
Russians, and the world community as well...[pauses] Playing the 
Crimean card at the time when certain interested forces are 
standing behind each player is risky and this ought not to be 
done. Therefore, I see my task in using all means available to 
the Supreme Council as a legislative body and to its commissions 
in order to relax and remove the tension. Everyone will profit 
by this.

    [Editorial Report] Kiev UT-1 Television Network in 
Ukrainian at 1720 GMT on 27 May broadcasts an approximate 
25-minute recorded speech by Ukraine's Supreme Council Chairman 
Oleksandr Moroz. However, due to technical difficulties, the 
first 10 minutes of the appearance was missed. 
  Oleksandr Moroz says there is a possibility that two more 
deputy Supreme Council chairmen will be elected, thereby more 
fully reflecting the different political forces in the Supreme 
Council. He says that it had been hoped that the parliamentary 
commissions would be formed quickly. The process is indeed 
coming to an end, and given the commissions' composition, he is 
sure that they will work fruitfully. However, says Oleksandr 
Moroz, political differences have emerged on the issue of the 
commission chairmen. According to Moroz, the principle of 
proportionality has been taken into account in this, too. But 
some groups, above all those of a right-wing tendency, although 
not numbering many representatives in parliament, are claiming 
and insisting on key positions and key commissions. 
  Although this may seem boring to viewers, who are waiting 
for 
some results from parliament, Moroz says: 
  "We must now create the conditions so that those results 
really will appear and so that the changes, which people are 
waiting for, occur in our state and in our society. The point 
is that we should change policy, first of all policy in the 
economic sector. We should move toward reforming the economy, 
but along which path? The one we have been going along until 
now? No, that is not right. For people understand very well 
that this path does not construct one's own economy, this does 
not strengthen the state. This destroys production, this robs 
the state. Everyone now understands this. And if someone wanted 
to reproach me or my supporters, or those who supported my 
candidacy, saying that we do not want to agree to a compromise, 
we have sufficient arguments to contradict them." 
  Moroz then cites as examples support for Mykhaylo Kosiv for 
the commission for culture issues and support for Hryhoriy 
Omelchenko for the commission for issues of the campaign against 
corruption and crime, and adds that similar examples of their 
compromising may be found in all commissions. 
  He continues: "Unfortunately, it appears that not everyone 
needs the work of the Supreme Council at all. Speculation has 
begun today on the matter of collecting signatures for the 
dissolution of the Supreme Council and the introducton of direct 
presidential rule. Nowhere in the world can one introduce the 
practice whereby, while the president's activity is coming to an 
end, he would risk introducing direct presidential rule. There 
are no grounds for it anyway. Moreover, there is no doubt that 
we will form working bodies of the Supreme Council on Tuesday 31 
May, that we will make, so to speak, a base for legislative 
work, and in order of their urgency the draft laws, which people 
are waiting for, will start to work. 
  "And to demand the introduction of direct presidential rule 
now, with unrest within society, which is caused above all by 
the collapse of the economy, unfair privatization, and many 
other ills, is at the very least irresponsible. I think the 
electors will understand that this is socially conditioned, that 
someone is directing their representatives toward such steps. I 
am convinced that the president would not resort to such steps 
and that he is not involved in this. I and he do not in fact 
have differences on the matter of the important steps which both 
the executive and legislative authorities must now take. It is 
above all about forming a strong executive power." 
  Moroz adds that a new Cabinet of Ministers and prime 
minister 
should be appointed urgently without wasting any time, and 
without waiting for the presidential election. He adds: 
  "One can say, for instance, that the president has now 
assumed responsibility for executive power, this is 
understandable. But the combination of the functions of 
president and head of government, and also the incomplete nature 
of the vertical structure of executive authority, confirm the 
necessity of concentrating power in the Cabinet of Ministers, in 
particular I mean executive power. And I am convinced that the 
Supreme Council supports such approaches, and that the president 
also agrees in principle with these approaches." 
  Moroz dwells on the methods used by those not wishing the 
Supreme Council to work efficiently, for example, not 
registering for the parliament sitting. If this method 
continues to be used, Moroz says he will ask the media to print 
the names of deputies refusing to register. In another case 
Moroz can see that a deputy from a right-wing group wants to 
cooperate, but is dependent on a certain political force. 
  Moroz says that he promised deputies today that the 
organizational process would be completed on 31 May, that he 
would submit candidacies for heads of commissions, and that the 
candidacies would be confirmed by voting, taking into account 
the proposals of all groups as much as possible, but bearing in 
mind that there can be no ideal solution. 
  He continues: "While understanding the complex situation in 
our state, I and my deputies have to intervene in specific 
matters, in the life of the regions, and not only Crimea, not 
only in the problems of, for instance, agriculture, preparations 
for the winter, problems of the energy complex, problems of the 
banking system. We also have to get involved in these problems, 
although I understand that to some extent these issues are more 
for the executive power to deal with. But now such intervention 
is truly needed, because those processes which ensure the 
freedom of production, facilitate commodity turnover, and an 
increase and consolidation of the budget should be speeded up." 
  Moroz concludes by saying: "Appealing to you, esteemed 
electors, I would like to ask you, please support those deputies 
who conscientiously work in the Supreme Council, who do not 
endeavor to resort to speculation, to disrupt the sittings, but 
honestly fulfil their obligations to you. I am convinced that 
their example will be a good model for other deputies, so that 
from next week the Supreme Council finally works constructively 
and efficiently, as current time demands, and as envisaged by 
the status of the state's highest legislative body. Thank you 
for your attention."
